***BEFORE CLEANING ANYTHING*** 

There is an Excel file in this OneDrive directory. Please indicate on that Excel file which ISSN and year you are cleaning/uploading so we don’t have people doing the same files. 

 

Steps for cleaning data: 

1) Convert from JSON to CSV 

Can be done with a converter. Feel free to use JSON to CSV Converter Online. It’s $10 a month to convert large data, but some of the files are small enough to convert for free. 

2) Clean CSV file 

Delete all unnecessary cells and replace the headers with the agreed upon parameters. 

We require the following parameters: 

Article_URL 
Article_Title 
Article_Author 
Article_Author_Country 
Article_Author_City 
Article_Author_University 
Article_Volume 
Article_Issue 
Article_Pages 
Article_Date 
Article_DOI 
Article_CitedBy 
Article_Type 
Article_OA 
Journal_Name 
Journal_ISSN 
Journal_eISSN 

After doing this, save the file as an Excel file, NOT a CSV.  

3) Push the Excel file to Access 

Import the Excel table into Access, creating a table. Add all additional data. Each table should contain all years but only for one journal. For each new journal, create a new table. 

4) Add your table to the master Access database (GMS_DB) on OneDrive 

This will help us build up a master database without having to merge all of our individual databases together.
