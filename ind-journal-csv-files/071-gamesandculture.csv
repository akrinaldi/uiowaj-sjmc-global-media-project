Close analyses of two live speedruns recorded at the biannual Games Done Quick charity marathon, guided by concepts from Deleuze and Guattari, explain how the player’s narrative body, space, and time are impacted by the optimizations and exploits of the Left 4 Dead series’ zombie narrative. While the zombie story preprogrammed for players is largely bypassed, speedrunning through the Left 4 Dead series’ environments is a generative act of rupture that activates and deepens storytelling tendencies within zombie media that embrace chaos and decay. The speedrun is itself a form of collapse, where scripted meaning and intentionality fall away, replaced by the chance and ephemeral story of an emergent, optimized engagement. © The Author(s) 2018.","emergent narrative; Left 4 Dead; speedrunning; time-image; zombies",,,,,,,,,"Aarseth, E., (1997) Cybertext: Perspectives on ergodic literature, , Baltimore, MD, John Hopkins University Press; Adkins, B., (2007) Death and desire in Hegel, Heidegger and Deleuze, , Edinburgh, Scotland, Edinburgh University Press; Bachelard, G., (1994) The poetics of space, , Boston, MA, Beacon Press; Boon, K., The zombie as other: Mortality and the monstrous in the post-nuclear age (2011) Better off dead: The evolution of the zombie as post-human, pp. 50-61. , Christie D., Lauro S.J., (eds), New York, NY, Fordham University Press, (Eds.), (., –; Booth, M., (2009) Replayable cooperative game design: Left 4 Dead.

First, this article questions the different degrees of bodily involvement in the practice of video games according to the different types of games and the mechanisms that allow the player to learn the games’ gesture patterns. Then, the objective is to study the effects of video gaming on the physical, psychological, and social dimensions of the player and to identify potential correlations between bodily involvement and health benefit. Indeed, bodily involvement translates into physical engagement, and sometimes motor expertise as required by the game, but also into the mobilization of the player’s cognitive and interactive resources with the video game devices. © The Author(s) 2018.","body; exergames; learning; taxonomy; video games",,,,,,,,,"Alvarez, J., Djaouti, D., (2010) Introduction au serious game, , Paris, France, Questions Théoriques; Anderson-Hanley, C., Arclero, P.J., Brickman, A.M., Nimon, J.P., Okuma, N., Westen, S.C., Zimmerman, E.A., Exergaming and older adult cognition.

The process of presenting maternal authority as monstrous and in need of containment is a patriarchal practice that reinforces the mother gamer’s unwelcome presence within video game culture, outlined through a brief examination of various representational trends regarding the maternal figure in games. These patriarchal signifying practices also operate to preserve broader domestic and societal gendered ideologies. Portal’s projections of maternal monstrousness are located within its villain’s taunting dialogue and her all-pervasive presence within the unsettling game space, representative of the reabsorbing maternal body. The application of Julia Kristeva’s abjection theory and Barbara Creed’s faces of the “monstrous-feminine” inform these observations and the construction of GLaDOS as an abject, abusive, and archaic mother. © The Author(s) 2018.","abject; archaic mother; monstrosity; motherhood; portal",,,,,,,,,"Batti, B., Clone club: Motherhood and technology in Orphan Black and Horizon Zero Dawn (2017) Not Your Mama’s Gamer, , http://www.nymgamer.com/?p=16704, August, 25, Retrieved from; Batti, B., Something’s not right: Monstrous motherhood and traumatic survival in Among the Sleep (2018) The Popular Culture Studies Journal, 6, pp. 399-419; Bergen, H., I’d blush if I could”: Digital assistants, disembodied cyborgs and the problem of gender (2016) Word & Text: A Journal of Literary Studies & Linguistics, 6, pp. 95-113; Bonenfant, M., Trépanier-Jobin, G., Bridging game studies and feminist theories.

The results demonstrated that while the brand image of Nintendo’s first-party software does have a positive relationship with the perceived quality of Nintendo’s consoles, this relationship did not lead to a higher degree of consumer utility for the Wii U console. Despite this, Nintendo’s perceived quality and brand image remained higher than their competitors, reinforcing that positive brand equity can act as a defense mechanism from underperforming products. © The Author(s) 2018.","blue ocean;

Despite the growing demand and lucrative nature of STEM fields, minorities have remained traditionally underrepresented in STEM careers, possibly due to digital divide factors. In this study, we use social cognitive theory to explore the potential of video gameplay to provide a means of increasing minority students’ comfort with information and communication technologies, thereby increasing their positive STEM attitudes. Data were gathered during a large-scale computing intervention in an elementary school district in the southeastern United States. The results indicate that video game experiences may influence STEM attitudes via the mediating role of computer self-efficacy and emotional costs. Video gameplay, including games for entertainment, may be beneficial for young digitally divided populations as it may provide them with positive enactive experiences with technology. © The Author(s) 2018.","digital divide; emotional costs; social cognitive theory; STEM divide; video games",,,,,,"National Science Foundation, NSF: DRL-0918216","The authors disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This project was funded by a grant from the National Science Foundation (DRL-0918216; Shelia R.

Based on 24 interviews with young people aged 9–14 (17 boys and 7 girls), this article sets out to provide an account of the appeal and experience of Fortnite. While it is impossible to pinpoint exactly why Fortnite has been such a phenomenal, global success, in this article, we argue that its appeal can be better explained by its intersections with YouTube and game livestreaming, the way the game acts as a vehicle for social capital and the performance of identity, and the rich sociality of play. © The Author(s) 2020.","battle royale;

According to theories from economic game theory and evolutionary anthropology, communities that are otherwise identical can spontaneously develop emergent cultural differences. We demonstrate the emergence of norm diversity in comparable populations distributed across identical copies of a single multiplayer game world. We use 2006 data from several servers of World of Warcraft to analyze how social contracts about resource distribution converge within independent communities, while varying across them. We find wide-ranging diversity in the norms that communities consider standard, fair, and common, even where these norms are unenforcable and players face large incentives to deviate from them.

Violation of “unwritten” rules and implicit local norms, however, are harder to track. Using boundary-work theory, this article demonstrates how different perspectives of unsportsmanlike behavior are defended and disputed by spectators within the esports mode of Counter Strike: Global Offensive (CS:GO). Triangulating data drawn from 50 hr of online observation followed by spectator interviews, this article examines how boundaries of (un)acceptability are drawn and/or redrawn around specific and ostensibly unsportsmanlike behaviors associated with “bad mannering,” “throwing,” and “bug exploiting” in CS:GO. These broad spectra of behavior imply a degree of complexity in local esport gaming contexts, engendering a protean boundary that sets it apart from more traditional views of sportsmanship and would benefit from further critical scholarship. © The Author(s) 2018.","boundary-work theory; counterstrike; esports; gamer behavior; spectatorship; sportsmanship",,,,,,,,,"Aarseth, E., (2003) Playing research: Methodological approaches to game analysis, , Paper presented at the Proceedings of the Digital Arts and Culture Conference, Melbourne, Australia; Abad, D., Sportsmanship (2010) Sport, Ethics and Philosophy, 4, pp. 27-41; Arnold, P.J., Three approaches toward an understanding of sportsmanship (1983) Journal of the Philosophy of Sport, 10, pp. 61-70; Bernstein, R., (2006) The code: The unwritten rules of fighting and retaliation in the NHL, , Chicago, IL, Triumph Books; Bishop, R., From behind the walls: Boundary work by news organizations in their coverage of Princess Diana’s death (1999) Journal of Communication Inquiry, 23, pp. 90-112; Bowditch, L., Chapman, J., Naweed, A., Do coping strategies moderate the relationship between escapism and negative gaming outcomes in World of Warcraft (MMORPG) players?

Instead, a “jury” of eliminated players vote for which of the remaining two to three contestants deserve to win the US$1,000,000 prize, based entirely on their personal opinion. In this article, I present an analysis of Final Tribal Council, where this decision is made, revealing the key themes that influence this decision. I subsequently propose a social constructionist approach to understanding and researching multiplayer games as moral economies, where diverse types of play are given different values by players.

In this article, we examine the process of sportification of eSports in the context of tournament broadcasts. We analyze the Overwatch World Cup 2016 tournament, comparing its final broadcast to the 2014 FIFA World Cup’s final broadcast, looking for similarities and differences in the areas of broadcast structure, commentary and expertise, game presentation, game highlights and acknowledgments, teams and players, and audience. © The Author(s) 2018.","broadcasting; electronic sports; FIFA; Overwatch; sportification",,,,,,"Academy of Finland

It revisits key tenets of life formation theory insofar as they can be applied to a small but growing corpus of games that emphasize spiritual and philosophical maturation and advancement. We argue that Joseph Campbell’s monomyth is an oversimplified and ultimately unsuitable lens through which to analyze character development in games, which restrains rather than stimulates the kind of complexities, diversity, and fluidity of character psychology needed in contemporary video game ecology. The main part of this study is dedicated to a comparative analysis of three indie games that address the life formation theme through allegories of space-in-time.

As one of these popular platforms, Twitch provides users with the opportunity to participate in several gaming situations: They can simultaneously watch in-game actions, the streamer playing the game, and additionally, they can interact with the streamer and other viewers by using the chat. In an online survey, the current study explored how individuals (N = 548) experience media enjoyment when using Twitch. Findings indicate that social aspects of using Twitch predominantly contribute to enjoyment.

The suite consists of two games, the first of which (Metro 2033) was based on the self-published novels of Dmitry Glukhovsky: Mempo 2033 (2005) and Mempo 2034 (2009). The games, like the novels, are set in the metro system of Moscow some 20 years after a nuclear apocalypse. Remnant communities, forced underground, congregate in stations that function as nascent city-states. Some stations are independent and unaligned, while others have formed factions (the mercantile “Hanza,” the communist “Red Line,” and the fascist “Fourth Reich”). A powerful central coalition, “Polis,” through the agency of its “Spartan” field agents, seems alone in its attempts to bring order to the metro and recolonize the ruined city above. But Polis and the Spartans are not the only such elements in Metro Redux, and players are quickly immersed in a landscape of Soviet neoclassicism, itself a polyvalent and highly politicized 20th-century Reception. This article will begin to explore what such receptions of Reception might mean. Does the Classical pulse, transmitted across multiple media, degrade to a point of white noise, meaningless and unintelligible? Or can we still find significance in the variation of reflection and transmission? © The Author(s) 2018.","classical reception studies; Metro 2033; Russian history; Russian literature; video games",,,,,,,,,"Aarseth, E.J., Computer game studies, year one (2001) Game Studies, 1, pp. 1-15; Bonjour, E., (1952) Schriften in auswahl, , Basle, Switzerland, Benno Schwabe; Borenstein, E., Dystopias and catastrophe tales after chernobyl (2015) Russian literature after 1991, pp. 86-103. , Dobrenko E., Lipovetsky M., (eds), Cambridge, England, Cambridge University Press, (Eds.), (., –; Chantev, A., The antiutopia factory (2009) Russian Social Science Review, 50, pp. 61-96; Damsky, A., Lamps and architecture 1930-1950 (1987) The Journal of Decorative and Propaganda Arts, 5, pp. 90-111; Eliot, T., (1921) The sacred wood, , New York, NY, Alfred A.

It describes three takeaways. The first is that the difficulty developers have in articulating their work to others has implications for how we learn, teach, and talk about development, including how we share knowledge across domains. The second is that, at least for newer developers, negotiation with technology rather than mastery characterizes daily work, and the third is that problems frequently arise in articulating and aligning the normally black-boxed work of individual developers. Resolution of these issues commonly depends on “soft” social skills; yet external pressures on developers mean they tidy up and professionalize accounts of their daily practice, thus both social conflict and soft skills have a tendency to disappear. © The Author(s) 2018.","ethnography; game developers; game development; learning; studio studies",,,,,,"Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada, SSHRC: 756-2012-0209

Shortly after, EA DICE announced that its 2015 flagship title Star Wars Battlefront would be adopting photogrammetry extensively not only to capture key props and costumes but also to recreate key locations beloved to Star Wars fans. Since then, the games industry has been flooded with articles, tutorials, and new software dedicated to the use of photogrammetry to create 3-D game assets.

Statistical fandom is presented as a cultural infrastructure, which influences how all fans perceive the game including what is valued in the game, how the game itself is played, and Major League Baseball as an industry. In building off of Halverson’s conception of a fantasy plane of baseball fandom, this research theorizes an additional statistical plane. Sabermetrics serve as a microcosm for a larger statistical turn in sports and reporting. The labor of saberfans builds a cultural algorithm through statistical analysis that shapes all fan engagement.

The measurement model and the structural model were analyzed with partial least squares (PLS). Subsequently, the PLS-prediction-oriented segmentation technique has been devoted to inspecting unobserved heterogeneity and to find players’ segments.

In this article, we review the history of voice interaction in digital games from a media archaeology perspective. Through detailed examination of publicly available information, we have identified and classified all games that feature some form of voice interaction and have received a public release. Our analysis shows that the use of voice interaction in digital games has followed a tidal pattern: rising and falling in seven distinct phases in response to new platforms and enabling technologies. We note characteristic differences in the way Japanese and Western game developers have used voice interaction to create different types of relationships between players and in-game characters. Finally, we discuss the implications for game design and scholarship in light of the increasing ubiquity of voice interaction systems. © The Author(s) 2017.","game design; media archaeology; media history; speech recognition; voice interaction",,,,,,,"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was supported by the Microsoft Research Centre for Social Natural User Interfaces and the Australian Government Research Training Program.",,"150 Best Games of All Time (1996) Computer Gaming World, 148, pp. 63-80. , 11; Altice, N., (2015) I am error: The Nintendo family computer/entertainment system platform, , Cambridge, MA, MIT Press; Apperley, T., Parikka, J., Platform studies’ epistemic threshold (2015) Games and Culture; Aylett, M.P., Kristensson, P.O., Whittaker, S., Vazquez-Alvarez, Y., None of a CHInd: Relationship counselling for HCI and speech technology (2014) CHI ‘14 extended abstracts on human factors in computing systems, pp. 749-760. , New York, NY, ACM, (., –; Baker, J., Deng, L., Glass, J., Khudanpur, S., Lee, C.-H., Morgan, N., O’Shaughnessy, D., Developments and directions in speech recognition and understanding, Part 1 [DSP Education] (2009) IEEE Signal Processing Magazine, 26, pp. 75-80; Berger, C., (1916) Sound-operated circuit-controller, , https://worldwide.espacenet.com/publicationDetails/biblio?II=0&ND=3&adjacent=true&locale=en_EP&FT=D&date=19161219&CC=US&NR=1209636A&KC=A, 12, 19, Retrieved August 15, 2017, from; Berger, C., (1917) Automatically-operating toy or the like, , https://worldwide.espacenet.com/publicationDetails/biblio?II=0&ND=3&adjacent=true&locale=en_EP&FT=D&date=19171016&CC=US&NR=1243380A&KC=A, 10, 16, Retrieved August 15, 2017, from; Berger, C., (1918) Sound-operated toy or instrument, , http://worldwide.espacenet.com/publicationDetails/biblio;jsessionid=cmLm1-lKKSLAdeqyB-BeTcCz.espacenet_levelx_prod_2FT=D&date=19180924&DB=&locale=&CC=US&NR=1279831A&KC=A&ND=1, 9, 24, Retrieved August 15, 2017, from; Bogost, I., Montfort, N., Platform studies: Frequently questioned answers (2009) Digital Arts and Culture Conference, , http://escholarship.org/uc/item/01r0k9br, Retrieved November 22, 2017, from, In; Carter, M., Allison, F., Downs, J., Gibbs, M., (2015) Player identity dissonance and voice interaction in Games, pp. 265-269. , Proceedings of the 2015 Annual Symposium on Computer-Human Interaction Play, New York, NY, ACM, (., –; Cohen, M.H., Giangola, J.P., Balogh, J., (2004) Voice user interface design, , Boston, MA, Addison-Wesley Professional; Consalvo, M., (2016) Atari to Zelda: Japan’s videogames in global contexts, , Cambridge, MA, MIT Press; RDI Halcyon, , http://www.videogameconsolelibrary.com/pg80-rdi.htm, Retrieved November 29, 2016, from; David, E., (2016) Was the world not ready for Rock Band 4 and Guitar Hero Live?, , http://siliconangle.com/blog/2016/02/12/was-the-world-not-ready-for-rock-band-4-and-guitar-hero-live/, 2, 12, Retrieved November 29, 2016, from; Dow, S., Mehta, M., Harmon, E., MacIntyre, B., Mateas, M., (2007) Presence and engagement in an interactive drama, pp. 1475-1484. , Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors Computing Systems, New York, NY, ACM, (., –; Fairbanks, A., (1931) Philostratus, imagines.

In spite of this, the notion of agency in video games has been rarely explicitly explored or defined in relation to its sociological and political dimensions. Hence, drawing on actor–network theory, (neo-)Foucauldian governmentality studies, and empirical data gathered over a 3-year period, this article expands to our understanding of video game player agency and, moreover, argues that video games provide an important example and perspective to consider the contemporary nature and political basis of agency. © The Author(s) 2018.","actor–network theory; agency; assemblage; freedom; interactivity; neoliberalism; video games",,,,,,"Eusko Jaurlaritza","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: The research on which this article is based received financial support from the Basque Government.",,"Arsenault, D., Perron, B., In the frame of the magic circle: The circle(s) of gameplay (2009) The video game theory reader, 2, pp. 109-131. , Wolf M.J., Perron B., (eds), New York, NY, Routledge, (Eds.), (., –; Brookey, R.A., Booth, P., Restricted play.

Two successfully crowdfunded case examples—Bloodstained (2018), a digital game, and Conan (2016), a board game—are used to illustrate changes crowdfunding causes in the traditional game production environment. In removing the publisher as an “unnecessary” middleman, crowdfunded productions need to take care of the many tasks that used to belong to publishers, such as marketing, partner sourcing, distribution networks, and customer relationships.

This article draws data from four case studies that were conducted as part of a sequential mixed-model study. The study explored the 21st-century skills students reported learning through their video game consumption and creation of intellectual property. The qualitative data analysis led to the development of five major findings: (1) the strategist: accomplishing the mission, (2) the creator: the art of gameplay, (3) the communicator: building relationships and communities, (4) the hero: to be the hero of a great adventure, and (5) I am an “elite”: a digital native. These findings attempt to create a profile of the 21st-century classroom gamer based on the data. They represent and support research trends that explore the gaming phenomenon, gamer traits, and 21st-century skills learned through playing video games. © The Author(s) 2018.","21st-century skills; gamer traits; gaming; video games",,,,,,,,,"Becker, S., Cummins, M., Davis, A., Freeman, A., Hall Giesinger, C., Ananthanarayanan, V., (2017) NMC horizon report: 2017 higher education edition, , Austin, TX, The New Media Consortium; Bartle, R., Hearts, clubs, diamonds, spades: Players who suit MUDs (1996) Journal of Virtual Environments, , http://www.arcadetheory.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/1996bartle.pdf, Retrieved December 10, 2017, from; Charmaz, K., Belgrave, L., (2002) Qualitative interviewing and grounded theory analysis.

The satirical character of the “narrator,” coupled with the game’s use of paradoxes, makes choosers aware of the catechistic structure that many didactic choices employ. This pedagogic choice structure has its roots in the TutorText series of programmed learning novels—a structure repeated (and hidden) by the Choose Your Own Adventure-style gamebooks that followed and that is subsequently parodied in The Stanley Parable.

It seeks to establish a cardinal set of relations to understand the compatibilities and incompatibilities traceable in the syntactic functional order of the different video game genres.

Building on recent research, the current study set out to develop a measure of gaming in difficult life situations (GDLS) and explored the role of emotion regulation and coping self-efficacy as predictors of this behaviour. A total of 667 gamers completed the online survey. Initial analyses demonstrated validity and reliability of the GDLS scale (α =.92), with players turning to gaming as a distraction from life difficulties, to feel a sense of achievement, to connect with others, and for in-game connection and simulation. Multiple regression analysis showed that younger age, more time spent gaming in general, and lower coping self-efficacy predicted GDLS, but emotion regulation was non-significant. The study presents novel insights and a new measure for future research in this area. © The Author(s) 2020.","coping self-efficacy; difficult life situations; emotion regulation; gaming",,,,,,,,,"Aldao, A., Nolen-Hoeksema, S., Schweizer, S., Emotion-regulation strategies across psychopathology: A meta-analytic review (2010) Clinical Psychology Review, 30 (2), pp. 217-237; Aldwin, C.M., Does age affect the stress and coping process?

Since its publication in 2009, the game industry evolved significantly, adding billions of players, dollars, and devices. One of the driving forces of this transformation has been the global diffusion of mobile media. This raises the question: Do mobile platforms and the app stores operated by Apple and Google allow for a radical departure from global hypercapitalism? This question will be explored by taking on three themes: shifts in labor, the political economy of platformization, and the capital-intensive mode of app production and circulation. Doing so addresses two gaps in Games of Empire’s approach: a dearth of empirical economic analysis and the acknowledgment of work in critical platform studies and mainstream economics. It is concluded that rather than providing a staging ground for dissent or collective action, apps of empire signal the foreclosure of an exodus from global hypercapitalism. © The Author(s) 2020.","app stores; apps; apps of empire; game industry; game production; platformization; platforms; political economy",,,,,,,,,"Barwise, T.P., Watkins, L., The evolution of digital dominance: How and why we got to GAFA (2018) Digital dominance: The power of Google, Amazon, Facebook, and Apple, pp. 21-49. , Oxford, Oxford University Press, &, M.

They code values and ideologies into games, but they are either not aware of it or deny it. Through a constructive and critical engagement with Games of Empire, I propose the concept of “ludic religiosity” to reveal how white masculinity informs game workers’ professional discourses, technological practices, ludic desires, and imaginations. Drawing on three-year-long ethnographic research and in conversation with cultural studies, philosophy of technology, and postcolonial game studies, I revisit desiring machine and ideology, two major concepts from Games of Empire. My goal is to demonstrate the racialized and gendered discourses and practices behind game developers’ desire to produce cognitive capitalism’s “escapist” commodities and rethink ideology within white masculine production cultures. Foregrounding how racialized and gendered practices and imaginations inform the desire behind the global game industry is crucial, especially in the aftermath of Gamergate and the rise of authoritarianism. © The Author(s) 2020.","creativity; desiring machine; ethnography; Games of Empire; gender; ideology; ludic religiosity; production; race; technology; video games; white masculinity",,,,,,,,,"Ahmed, S., A phenomenology of whiteness (2007) Feminist Theory, 8 (2), pp. 149-168; Anable, A., (2018) Playing with feelings: Video games and affect, , Minneapolis, University of Minnesota Press; Benjamin, R., (2019) Race After Technology: Abolitionist Tools for the New Jim Code, , UK, Polity; Bignall, S., Patton, P., (2010) Deleuze and the postcolonial, , Edinburgh, Edinburgh University Press, &, (Eds; Bogost, I., (2006) Unit operations: An approach to videogame criticism, , Massachusetts, MIT Press; Bonilla-Silva, E., (2014) Racism without racists: Color-blind racism and the persistence of racial inequality in America, , 4th ed., Lanham, MD, Rowman & Littlefield; Braithwaite, A., It’s about ethics in games journalism?

Using pro-social behavior as the dependent variable, this study explores factors beyond VVG content as a contributing factor to player outcomes. Participants were randomly assigned to play VVG or non-VVG content with viewing screens obstructed by large pieces of paper to increase difficulty, or unobstructed. Screen condition accounted for 34.5% of the variance in pro-social behavior of helping to retrieve spilled pens. Players in obstructed viewing conditions experienced more in-game losses and engaged in significantly less helping behavior. Fewer pens were retrieved by participants in obstructed viewing conditions while playing either a VVG or non-VVG. The present study cautions against generalized assumptions that VVG content is a primary determinant of behavior and underscores the role of important contextual factors like failure and achievement loss to consider in future studies of this nature. © The Author(s) 2020.","adolescents; aggression; pro-social behavior; video game; violence; virtual environments",,,,,,,,,"Adachi, P.J.C., Willoughby, T., The effect of video game competition and violence on aggressive behavior: Which characteristic has the greatest influence?

The shift from a reading mode to a playing mode marks a shift in news semogenesis strategies that need to be investigated to provide a better understanding of the emerging genres of news gamification and to build some reflections on the ongoing changes in journalistic practices and news values. This article takes a case study of the Al Jazeera gamified news, #Hacked-Syria’s Electronic Armies. The article aims to account for the semogenic resources employed by #Hacked and the resulting aesthetic and immersive experience of interactivity. It is found that #Hacked makes sense through the medium of aesthetics of interactivity. Studied through the lens of systemic functional linguistics, aesthetics in the context of the current study is not reduced to a mere attention to style; rather it describes a different and unique digital process of meaning making based on the participant’s immersive interactivity and choices. It is the semogenic power of choice and the immersive aesthetics of interactivity that mainly create #Hacked news value. The analysis yields that #Hacked reconfigures traditional notions of readers, news, and news values. © The Author(s) 2020.","aesthetics of interactivity; immersive aesthetics; media convergence; news gamification; news values; semogenesis strategies; SFL",,,,,,,,,"Abbs, P., Defining the aesthetic field (1991) Aesthetics and arts education, pp. 245-255. , Smith R.A., Simpson A., (eds), University of Illinois, (Eds.), (., –; Adami, E., Aesthetics in digital texts beyond writing: A social semiotic multimodal framework (2015) Studies in writing, 30, pp. 43-62. , Rijlaarsdam G., (ed),.

It is useful to develop a deeper understanding of digital play and to explore ways in which caregivers can guide young people in their play to recognize and develop different types of learning. This article attempts to address these issues through proposing a metalanguage for digital play. The theoretical orientation adopted in this article is that of social semiotics and critical multiliteracies. Our focus is on harnessing the affordances of digital play for learning by systematizing them into a metalanguage based on social semiotic theory that models the meaning potential of semiotic resources into the representation, engagement, and organization functions. From the metalanguage, the pedagogical implications or a set of principles of using digital play for learning in the classroom context are discussed. © The Author(s) 2020.","digital learning; metalanguage; multiliteracies; multimodal digital play; social semiotics",,,,,,,,,"Allison, F., Whose mind is the signal?

Using the tripartite model developed by French musical semiotician Jean-Jacques Nattiez, I consider how the player encounters music and its attendant folklorism in the game (neutral level), how folklorism is embedded in the text through composer activities (poiesis), and how that folklorism can be interpreted by the game’s primarily Western Anglophone player-base (esthesis). The soundtrack’s folklorism as a stylistic musical phenomenon is also related to relevant ethnomusicological scholarship and considered within the larger cultural industry surrounding the game. In doing so, it is shown not only how The Witcher 3’s musical folklorism contributes to the game’s spatiotemporal aesthetics but also how creative musical intentions are transmitted, received, and mediated through the video game medium and its surrounding cultural discourses. © The Author(s) 2020.","ethnomusicology; exoticism; semiotics; The Witcher 3; video game music",,,,,,,,,"Aarseth, E., A narrative theory of games (2012) FDG’12: International Conference on the Foundations of Digital Games, pp. 129-133. , Raleigh, NC:, Association for Computing Machinery, (., –; (2006) The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion, , Bethesda Softworks; Blacha, M., Kubiński, P., Creating The Witcher’s World: An Interview with Marcin Blacha of CD Projekt Red (2016) Culture.pl, , https://culture.pl/en/article/creating-the-witchers-world-an-interview-with-marcin-blacha-of-cd-projekt-red/; Bińczak, K., Broda, M., The Witcher 3: Wild hunt soundtrack (2015) Gamemusic.pl, , http://gamemusic.pl/en/wiedzmin-3-dziki-gon-2/; (2012) Diablo III; Bohlman, P.V., (2002) World music: A very short introduction, , Oxford University Press; (2016) Capital Group, , https://www.cdprojekt.com/en/capital-group/; (2015) The Witcher 3: Wild hunt, , Projekt; Chapman, M., Thoughts on celtic music (1994) Ethnicity, identity and music: The musical construction of place, pp. 29-44. , Stokes M., (ed), Berg Publishers, (Ed.), (., –; Curta, F., (2004) The making of the Slavs: History and archaeology of the lower Danube region, c. 500-700, , Cambridge University Press; During, J., Atayan, R., Spector, J., Hassan, S.Q., Morris, R.C., Kamāncheh (2001) Grove Music Online, , http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/grovemusic/view/10.1093/gmo/9781561592630.001.0001/omo-9781561592630-e-0000014649./; Fenlon, W., The Witcher 3 outgrossed some of 2017’s biggest games because it’s just that good (2018) PC Gamer, , https://www.pcgamer.com/the-witcher-3-outgrossed-some-of-2017s-biggest-games-because-its-just-that-good/; Gimbutas, M., Slavic religion (2005) Encyclopedia of religion, pp. 8432-8439. , Jones L., (ed), Macmillan Reference USA, (Ed.), (., –; Grimshaw, M., (2008) The acoustic ecology of the first-person shooter, , VDM Verlag; (2001) Davul, , http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/grovemusic/view/10.1093/gmo/9781561592630.001.0001/omo-9781561592630-e-0000007314./; Hart, I., Meaningful play: Performativity, interactivity and semiotics in video game music (2014) Musicology Australia, 36, pp. 273-290; Istenič, S.P., Texts and contexts of folklorism (2011) Traditiones, 40, pp. 51-73; Lantos, I., Review essay: Bulgaria’s magical mystère tour: Postmodernism, world music marketing, and political change in Eastern Europe (1997) Ethnomusicology, 41, pp. 131-157; Locke, R.P., (2009) Musical exoticism: Images and reflections, , Cambridge University Press; Locke, R.P., (2010) Exoticism”, entry in Grove Music Online, , http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/grovemusic/view/10.1093/gmo/9781561592630.001.0001/omo-9781561592630-e-0000045644./, [Online]; Lomax, A., (1968) Folk song style and culture, , American Association for the Advancement of Science; Majkowski, T.Z., Geralt of Poland: The Witcher 3 between epistemic disobedience and imperial nostalgia (2018) Open Library of Humanities, 4, pp. 2-35; Makuch, E., (2016) How The Witcher 3's Amazing Music and Sound Effects Were Made; (2018) Top results for “The Witcher 3, , https://www.metacritic.com/search/all/the%20witcher%203/results; Morris, R.C., Bağlama (2001) Grove Music Online, , http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/grovemusic/view/10.1093/gmo/9781561592630.001.0001/omo-9781561592630-e-0000052319; Murphy, D., Where does world music come from?

The medium has evolved to such a degree that evaluation should not rest on whether an individual game can be considered art, but what types of aesthetic engagement the medium affords. A key figure in the study of the visual arts is aesthetic contemplation, in which extended attention reveals aesthetic differences. Although the video game presents many sites and scenes worthy of such contemplation, this mode of spectatorship requires sufficient time and space to attend to a visual object. In order to open up a space for aesthetic engagement, many of the ludological and narrative demands of the game must recede. In this article, we will investigate the degree to which players have choice in how, or how long, they attend to a game’s visual environment. © The Author(s) 2020.","aesthetic pace; aesthetic perception; immersive environments; video games; visual arts",,,,,,,,,"Anderson, J.D., Toward an ecology of the arts (2014) Psychocinematics: Exploring cognition at the movies, pp. 76-93. , Shimamura A.P., (ed), Oxford University Press, (Ed.), (., –; Arp, J., (1962) Torse des pyrenées, , Statue, Musée d’Art Moderne et Contemporain de la Ville de Strasbourg, Strasbourg, [,]; Atkinson, P., Why pause?

In accepting this challenge, this article theorizes the historical phenomenon of abstract board games whose nonrepresentational board design and formal rules have transmitted with little change over millennia and across vast expanse. A theoretical framework is outlined for understanding abstract board games—a modular ontology of abstract board games and a typology of player meaning-making in abstract board games. It is argued that the reproducibility and transferability of abstract board games as self-sufficient and reliable formal systems that players share independently from culturally specific meanings and materials may contribute to their dispersal. It is in this interaction between the cross-cultural/reliable and local/variable semantic structures of abstract board games that game studies from a historical or archaeological perspective may meet literary and social science perspectives. © The Author(s) 2020.","abstract board games; archaeology; formal rules; meaning-making; ontology",,,,,,,,,"Adams, J., (2006) Power play: The literature and politics of chess in the late middle ages, , University of Pennsylvania Press; Bogost, I., (2007) Persuasive games: The expressive power of videogames, , MIT Press; Caillois, R., The definition of play and the classification of games (2006) The game design reader: A rules of play anthology, pp. 122-155. , Salen K., Zimmerman E., (eds), MIT Press, (Eds.), (., –; Charpentier, V., de Voogt, A., Crassard, R., Berger, J.-F., Borgi, F., Al-Mashani, A., Games on the seashore of Salalah: The discovery of mancala games in Dhofar, Sultanate of Oman (2014) Arabian Archaeology and Epigraphy, 25, pp. 115-120; Chick, G., Games in culture revisited: A replication and extension of Roberts, Arth, and Bush (1959) (1998) Cross-Cultural Research, 32 (2), pp. 185-206; Chick, G., Comment on ‘strategic games in society: The geography of adult play.’ (2017) International Journal of Play, 6 (3), pp. 319-321; Crawford, C., (1984) The art of computer game design: Reflections of a master game designer, , Osborne/McGraw-Hill; Crist, W., (2016) Games of thrones: Board games and social complexity in Bronze Age Cyprus, , https://repository.asu.edu/items/40805, PhD dissertation, Arizona State University], [; Crist, W., Playing against complexity: Board games as social strategy in Bronze Age Cyprus (2019) Journal of Anthropological Archaeology, 55. , https://doi.org/10.1016/j/jaa2019.101078; Crist, W., de Voogt, A., Dunn-Vaturi, A.-E., Facilitating interaction: Board games as social lubricants in the ancient Near East (2016) Oxford Journal of Archaeology, 35 (2), pp. 181-198; Crist, W., Dunn-Vaturi, A.-E., de Voogt, A., (2016) Ancient Egyptians at play: Board games across borders, , Bloomsbury Academic Press; Culin, S., (1894) Mancala, the national game of Africa, , https://healthy.uwaterloo.ca/museum/Archives/Culin/Mancla1894/index.html, National Museum; de Voogt, A., (1997) Mancala board games, , British Museum Press; de Voogt, A., The absence of games in the presence of claims.

Our object of study is CryptoKitties, the first instance of a blockchain-based game that has garnered media recognition and financial interest. The objective of this article is to demonstrate the limits of scarcity in value construction for owners of CryptoKitties tokens, manifested as breedable virtual cats. Our work extends the trends set out by earlier cryptocurrency studies from the perspective of cultural studies. For the purpose of this article, we rely on open blockchain analytics such as DappRadar and Etherscan, as well as player-created analytics, backed by a one-year-long participant observation period in the said game for research material.

While different aspects of eSports have been investigated in separate contexts, in this article, we report findings of two survey studies to explore eSports as a holistic media ecosystem that includes playing, streaming, viewing, and spending. Study 1 looks at cross-platform patterns between playing and spending within the game as well as between viewing, streaming, and spending on live streaming platforms in the context of Fortnite. Study 2 examines the relationships between viewing and spending patterns on live streaming platforms. Results indicate that playing, viewing, and in-game spending are strongly related. Yet none of these behavioral metrics explain why people spend money on live streaming platforms to support streamers.

It takes a comparative analytical approach that examines the historical documentation and cultural output of these two major categories of sports and their early institutionalization. Given the increasing interest in, engagement with and spectator numbers of E-sports, it is worth considering the key similarities and differences between various institutions. This article examines traditional sports institutions from the mid-19th to late 19th century alongside E-sports institutions that emerged from the mid-1990s to the present day. Firstly, the processes of institutionalization are analyzed with these examples in mind and, secondly, are compared to draw out the significant differences and similarities between the factors affecting early institutionalization. © The Author(s) 2019.","analog gaming; e-sports; E-sports; esports; institutionalization; spectator; sports",,,,,,,,,"Abanazir, C., Institutionalisation in e-sports (2018) Ethics and Philosophy, , [Online journal]; Ager, D., (2005) The soccer referee’s manual.

We hypothesized that streaming can act as a form of implicit incentive to boost players’ performance and engagement. To test this hypothesis, we continuously collected data about all Twitch streams related to a popular Multiplayer Online Battle Arena (MOBA) game, League of Legends (LoL), and data of all LoL matches played during the same time frame, and cross-mapped the two data sets. We found that, counterintuitively, streaming significantly deteriorates players’ in-game performance: This may be due to the burden of carrying out two cognitively intensive activities at the same time, namely, playing the game and producing its commentary for streaming purposes.

This study explored the social and cognitive effects on players of two “art games” (Depression Quest and Actual Sunlight) by analyzing player-generated discussion board posts, focusing on (1) what real-life social and cognitive effects the games had on players and (2) what elements of the games made the players consider them “good” or “bad” games. Players reported or demonstrated that the games led to understanding and empathy, self-evaluation, lessons learned, clinical discussion of depression, encouragement to others, a sense of community, and opening dialogue with friends and family.

In the first part, I combine a critical modification of Kendall Walton’s concept of reflexive representation with Edmund Husserl’s concept of image consciousness, in order to clarify the ontological difference between physical models and depictive images. In the second part, I discuss the relationship between physical models and virtual things, and the difference between photographic depiction and screen-mediated prosthetic vision.

This article’s main aim is to analyze BioShock Infinite, an illustrative case study of these conflicts. On the one hand, it is a video game that portrays a dystopian narrative, aligning itself with this genre’s critical progressive tradition; on the other hand, its gameplay has an accentuated neoliberal bent. The analysis of BioShock Infinite also helps us to critically discuss certain trends in game design in contemporary mainstream video games that connect with and reinforce neoliberal values. © The Author(s) 2017.","BioShock Infinite; design; dystopia; ideology; neoliberalism; procedural rhetoric; video game",,,,,,,,,"Aldred, J., Greenspan, A., A man chooses, a slave obeys: BioShock and the dystopian logic of convergence (2011) Games and Culture, 6, pp. 479-496; Allen, K., Mendick, H., Keeping it real?

While physical arcade spaces have receded in number, the metaphysical elements of the arcades persist. We examine the historical conditions around the establishment of so-called arcade culture, taking into account the history of public entertainment spaces, such as pool halls, coin-operated entertainment technologies, video games, and the demographic and economic conditions during the arcade’s peak popularity, which are historically connected to the advent of bachelor subculture. Drawing on these complementary histories, we examine the social and historical movement of arcades and arcade culture, focusing upon the Street Fighter series and the fighting game community (FGC). Through this case study, we argue that moral panics concerning arcades, processes of cultural norm selection, technological shifts, and the demographic peculiarities of arcade culture all contributed to its current decline and discuss how they affect the contemporary FGC. © The Author(s) 2017.","arcades; community; gamer; gender; history; identity; sociology",,,,,,,,,"Ashcraft, B., (2008) Arcade Mania: The Turbo-charged world of Japan’s game centers, , New York, NY, Kodansha International; (2015) [Goal] Let Capcom know that you do not want R Mika’s taunt removed from Street Fighter V, , www.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/3s84gp/goal_let_capcom_know_that_your_do_not_want_r/, Retrieved June 27, 2016, from; Bell, D., (1973) The coming of post-industrial society: A venture in social forecasting, , New York, NY, Basic Books; Bourdieu, P., The forms of capital (2008) Readings in economic sociology, pp. 280-291. , Biggart N.W., (ed), Malden, MA, Blackwell, (Ed.), (., –; Brown, P., (2016) Street fighter 5’s Yoshinori Ono reflects on the past, worries about the future, , http://www.gamespot.com/articles/street-fighter-5s-yoshinori-ono-reflects-on-the-pa/1100-6434227/, Retrieved June 27, 2016, from; Carroll, B., Bachelorhood (2003) American masculinities: A historical encyclopedia, pp. 45-47. , Carroll B., (ed), Thousand Oaks, CA, Sage, (Ed.), (., –; Chudacoff, H.P., (1999) The age of the bachelor: Creating an American subculture, , Princeton, NJ, Princeton University Press; (2016) Ono confirms Mika butt slap was removed due to ‘fan feedback.’, , https://www.reddit.com/r/Kappa/comments/433ai4/ono_confirms_mika_butt_slap_was_removed_due_to/, Retrieved June 27, 2016, from; Connell, R.W., Messerschmidt, W., Hegemonic masculinity: Rethinking the concept (2005) Gender and Society, 19, pp. 829-859; Consalvo, M., (2007) Cheating: Gaining advantage in videogames, , London, England, MIT Press; Ellis, D., (1985) Student participation in video arcades: A sociological study of causes and consequences, , Downsview, Ontario, Toronto Board of Education and York University; (2016), http://www.eventhubs.com/imagegallery/2016/jan/20/more-street-fighter-5-alternate-costumes-images/11/, Retrieved June 27, 2016, from; (2015) Street Fighter Producer Yoshinori Ono confirms in translated interview that they are “toning down” sexuality in Street Fighter V so people are not “uncomfortable, , https://www.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/3w02oy/street_fighter_producer_yoshinori_ono_confirms_in/, Retrieved June 27, 2016, from; Goffman, E., (1972) Encounters: Two studies in the sociology of interaction, , Harmondsworth, England, Penguin; Goffman, E., (1974) Frame analysis: An essay on the organization of experience, , Boston, MA, Harper Colophon; Golding, D., The end of gamers (2015) The state of play: Creators and critics on video game culture, pp. 127-140. , Goldberg, Larsson, (eds), New York, NY, Seven Stories Press, (Eds.), (., –; Graham, D.P., Chen, J., (2015) No ifs, ands, or butts, , https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwokDvTYYhk, Retrieved June 27, 2016, from; Guererro, J., (2016) ESRB speaks out on the process of giving Street Fighter 5 a Teen rating, , http://www.eventhubs.com/news/2016/jan/04/esrb-speaks-out-process-giving-street-fighter-5-teen-rating/, Retrieved June 27, 2016, from, (, a; Guererro, J., (2016) Mika too sexy for ESPN?

Interactivity and gameplay are closely related, as interactivity is necessary for gameplay. Unfortunately, this close relationship has led many video game scholars to conflate these two concepts when discussing player experience. In this article, I argue that, when discussing emotional responses to video games, gameplay and interactivity should be understood as distinct concepts: Gameplay involves both interactive and noninteractive elements, and interactive works do not always involve gameplay. I propose that there are significant drawbacks to overlooking this distinction and that highlighting it is important for understanding player experience, player emotion, and the ways video games differ from other entertainment media. © The Author(s) 2019.","emotion; game; gameplay; interactivity; video game",,,,,,,,,"Aarseth, E.J., (1997) Cybertext: Perspectives on ergodic literature, , Baltimore, MD, Johns Hopkins University Press; Apter, M.J., A structural-phenomenology of play (1991) Adult play: A reversal theory approach, pp. 13-29. , Apter M.J., Kerr J.H., (eds), Amsterdam, the Netherlands, Garland Science, (Eds.), (., –; Apter, M.J., Phenomenological frames and the paradoxes of experience (1993) Advances in reversal theory, pp. 13-26. , Kerr J.H., Murgatroyd S., Apter M.J., (eds), Amsterdam, the Netherlands, Psychology Press, (Eds.), (., –; Apter, M.J., (2007) Reversal theory: The dynamics of motivation, emotion, and personality, , Oxford, England, Oneworld; Apter, M.J., Kerr, J.H., (1991) Adult play, , Amsterdam, the Netherlands, Garland Science, (Eds; Barthes, R., (1975) S/Z: An essay, , Miller R., (ed), New York, NY, Hill & Wang, (, Trans; Bateson, G., A theory of play and fantasy (1955) Psychiatric Research Reports, 2, pp. 39-51; Bordwell, D., (1985) Narration in the fiction film, , Madison, University of Wisconsin Press; Bucy, E., Interactivity in society: Locating an elusive concept (2004) The Information Society, 20, pp. 373-383; Caillois, R., (2001) Man, play, and games, p. 1958. , Barash M., (ed), Urbana, University of Illinois Press.

Recent outspoken misogyny has brought to the surface some of the underlying gender inequality within games cultures but also points to areas that researchers in the field need to be alive to in their own work. © The Author(s) 2017.","feminism; games culture; games studies; intersectionality; reflexivity",,,,,,,,,"Balsamo, A., (1996) Technologies of the gendered body: Reading cyborg women, , Durham, NC, Duke University Press; Banet-Weiser, S., Miltner, K., #MasculinitySoFragile: Culture, structure, and networked misogyny (2016) Feminist Media Studies, 16, pp. 171-174; Braithwaite, A., It’s about ethics in games journalism?

Based on in-depth interviews, ethnographic research, and the analysis of archive documents from the past few years, this study identifies China’s evolving strategy of neo-techno-nationalism. In the Chinese context, this national strategy manipulates technology to create a version of popular nationalism that is both acceptable to and easily censored by the authorities. Therefore, cultural industries that adopt this strategy stand a good chance of prevailing in the Chinese market. This success explains why the regional competitors of Chinese online games—Korean games—are more successful in China than most of their Western counterparts. By providing a snapshot of the current ecology of China’s online game industry, this article also discusses the influence of regional and global forces in a concrete context and argues that the development of China’s online game industry depends more on political factors than economic factors. © The Author(s) 2017.","globalization; neo-techno-nationalism; online game industry; political economy; regionalization; the nation-state",,,,,,,"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: Funding for this study was provided by Project 14CXW031 supported by National Social Science Foundation of China.",,"Anderson, B., (2006) Imagined communities: Reflections on the origin and spread of nationalism, , London, England, Verso; Aoyama, Y., Izushi, H., Hardware gimmick or cultural innovation?

This article demonstrates a way to acknowledge the complexity of this audience without dismissing its most virulent tendencies via practice theory and weak theory. Using data drawn from a qualitative survey of 393 self-identified first-person shooter video game players, this article looks at the specific practice of “teabagging” in online competitive gaming contexts. Ultimately, this article argues that drawing attention to the gaps and fissures that local gaming practices can produce in broader structures of gaming, sexuality, and class can help critical gaming scholars encourage and cultivate such practices as well as construct new, reparative alliances between different fields and communities. © The Author(s) 2017.","culture; gamer; gender; media audiences; practice theory; sexuality; teabagging; video games",,,,,,,,,"Appiah, K.A., (2005) The ethics of identity, , Princeton, NJ, Princeton University Press; Baym, N.K., Question six: What constitutes quality in qualitative internet research?

A long tradition has investigated morals using games such as Ultimatum and Dictator; however, this research often omits interplayer moral dialogue. Further, when moral foundations theory is accounted for, analysis of these games seems to investigate a narrow range of moral reasoning. In this methodological critique, we draw upon data from gameplay of a simulation of climate change debate and find a wide range of moral foundations through analysis of dialogue. Our analysis suggests that in-game player dialogue is a source of rich moral deliberation and potential for using simulation games as grounds for discovering new moral foundations. © The Author(s) 2017.","dialogue; dictator game; ethics; fairness; game theory; games; moral foundations theory; morals; negotiation; ultimatum game",,,,,,,,,"Aguiar, F., Brañas-Garza, P., Espinosa, M.P., Miller, L.M., (2007) Personal identity in the dictator game, , Jena Economic Research Papers; Ambec, S., Sprumont, Y., Sharing a river (2002) Journal of Economic Theory, 107, pp. 453-462; Axelrod, R., More effective choice in the prisoner’s dilemma (1980) The Journal of Conflict Resolution, 24, pp. 379-403; Beal, S., Ghintran, A., Remila, E., Solal, P., The river sharing problem: A survey (2013) International Game Theory Review, 15; Bogost, I., The rhetoric of video games (2008) The ecology of games: Connecting youth, games, and learning, pp. 117-140. , Schrier K., (ed), Cambridge, MA, MIT Press, (Ed.), (., –; Camerer, C., Thaler, R.H., Anomalies: Ultimatums, dictators and manners (1995) Journal of Economic Perspectives, 9, pp. 209-219; Costikyan, G., Diplomacy, the prisoners’ dilemma, and the mechanics of ethics, in chapter 1: Quick takes on ethics and games: Voices from industry and academia (2010) Designing games for ethics: Models, techniques, and frameworks, , Schrier K., (ed), Hershey, PA: IGI Global, (Ed; Dalbert, C., Umlauft, S., The role of the justice motive in economic decision making (2009) Journal of Economic Psychology, 30, pp. 172-180; Dray, A., Perez, P., Le Page, C., D’Aquino, P., White, I., Who wants to terminate the game?

It argues that while the variations in Mahjong can be described as sitting together in a family resemblance, the specificities of the technologies and the sociocultural contexts involved give rise to new kinds of playful practices that are not reducible to the “transmedial Mahjong” but whose understanding nevertheless necessitates knowledge of the rules and conventions of Mahjong. This not only casts critical light on how the “ludological” paradigm of game studies has defined its object of study but also prompts reconsideration of the role of technology when applying perspectives that emphasize the processual nature of games. © The Author(s) 2017.","China; Mahjong; play; technology; transmediality",,,,,,,"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: The work described in this paper was substantially supported by a grant from the Research Grants Council of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China (Project No. CityU 11405314, PI: Leino).",,"Aarseth, E., Playing research: Methodological approaches to game analysis [Special issue: DAC Conference Papers] (2003) Fine Art Forum, 17, pp. 1-8. , 8; Aarseth, E., Define real, moron!” some remarks on game ontologies (2011) DIGAREC Keynote-Lectures 2009/10.

The essay examines particular concepts that have been subject to hermeneutical debate and suggests they might be understood through an appreciation of how Huizinga deliberately cultivated clashing points of view in his work as an embodiment of his poetic methodology. This methodology is, in turn, reflected by particular rhetorical practices evident in his writing style. The essay discusses three specific rhetorical devices used by Huizinga in Homo Ludens to make knowledge about play. With these realizations about Huizinga’s rhetoric and methodology in mind, the essay then contextualizes his use of the term magic circle within the political agenda of Huizinga’s writing in general as a philosophical response to logical positivism. The essay concludes by reflecting upon how an appreciation of Huizinga’s rhetoric, methodology, and politics might be helpful for student-researchers. © The Author(s) 2017.","Homo Ludens; Huizinga; magic circle; methodology; play; rhetoric",,,,,,,,,"Bogost, I., (2010) Persuasive games: The expressive power of videogames, , Reprint ed, Cambridge, MA, The MIT Press; Burke, K., (1969) A rhetoric of motives, , Revised ed, Berkeley, University of California Press; Burke, K., (1984) Permanence and change: An anatomy of purpose, , 3rd ed, Berkeley, University of California Press; Caillois, R., (2001) Man, play and games, , Reprint ed, Urbana, University of Illinois Press; Calleja, G., Digital games and escapism (2010) Games and Culture, 5, pp. 335-353. , http://doi.org/10.1177/1555412009360412; Consalvo, M., There is no magic circle (2009) Games and Culture, 4, pp. 408-417; Daniel-Wariya, J., Philip Roth’s comic corrective (2012) Baseball and social class: Essays on the democratic game that isn’t, pp. 148-161. , Kates R.E., Tormey W., (eds), Jefferson, McFarland, (Eds.), (., –; Dyer-Witheford, N., Peuter, G.D., (2009) Games of empire: Global capitalism and video games, , Minneapolis, MN, University of Minnesota Press; Evans, C.H., Baseball as civil religion: The genesis of an American creation story (2002) The faith of 50 million: Baseball, religion, and American culture, pp. 13-34. , Evans C.H., Herzog II W.R., (eds), Louisville, KY, Westminster John Knox Press, (Eds.), (., –; Evans, C.H., Herzog II, W.R., (2002) The faith of 50 million: Baseball, religion, and American culture, , Louisville, KY, Westminster John Knox Press, (Eds; Ferrara, J., (2012) Playful design: Creating game experiences in everyday interfaces, , Brooklyn, NY, Rosenfeld Media; Fuchs, M., Ludoarchaeology (2014) Games and Culture, 9, pp. 528-538; Hugenholtz, F.W.N., The fame of a masterwork (2014) Johan Huizinga 1872-1972: Papers delivered to the Johan Huizinga Conference Groningen 11-15 December 1972, pp. 91-103. , Koops W.R.H., Kossmann E.H., Plaat G.V.D., (eds), New York, NY, Springer, (Eds.), (., –; Huizinga, J., (1936) In the shadow of tomorrow, , New York, NY, W.W.

These associations were examined among 51 pairs of friends in eighth grade, who regularly play online first-person shooters together. Results indicated that poor friendship quality was related positively to verbal aggression, trolling, and camping. In addition, these relationships were mediated by anger and revenge planning. These findings suggest that friendship quality, anger, and revenge planning are important in adolescents’ aggressive behaviors through first-person shooters. © The Author(s) 2017.","actor–partner interdependence model; adolescent; aggression; anger; dyad; friendship; friendship quality; gaming console; revenge planning",,,,,,"European Social Fund, ESF","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was supported by the project “Employment of Best Young Scientists for International Cooperation Empowerment” (CZ.1.07/2.3.00/30.0037) co-financed from European Social Fund and the state budget of the Czech Republic.",,"Anderson, C.A., Bushman, B.J., Human aggression (2002) Annual Review of Psychology, 52, pp. 27-51; Anderson, C.A., Carnagey, N.L., Flanagan, M., Benjamin, A.J., Eubanks, J., Valentine, J.C., Violent video games: Specific effects of violent content on aggressive thoughts and behavior (2004) Advances in Experimental Social Psychology, 36, pp. 199-249; Anderson, C.A., Shibuya, A., Ihori, N., Swing, E.L., Bushman, B.J., Sakamoto, A., Violent video game effects on aggression, empathy, and prosocial behavior in eastern and western countries: A meta-analytics review (2010) Psychological Bulletin, 136, pp. 151-173. , …; Bandura, A., (1971) Psychological modeling: Conflicting theories, , Chicago, IL, Aldine Atherton; Banny, A.M., Heilbron, N., Ames, A., Prinstein, M.J., Relational benefits of relational aggression: Adaptive and maladaptive associations with adolescent friendship quality (2011) Developmental Psychology, 47, pp. 1153-1166; Barlett, C.P., Harris, R.J., Baldassaro, R., Longer you play, the more hostile you feel: Examination of first person shooter video games and aggression during video game play (2007) Aggressive Behavior, 33, pp. 1-12; Bartholow, B.D., Bushman, B.J., Sestir, M.A., Chronic violent video game exposure and desensitization to violence: Behavioral and event-related brain potential data (2006) Journal of Experimental Social Psychology, 42, pp. 532-539; Berkowitz, L., (1993) Aggression: Its causes, consequences, and control, , New York, NY, McGraw-Hill; Birch, S.H., Ladd, G.W., The teacher–child relationship and children’s early school adjustment (1997) Journal of School Psychology, 35, pp. 61-79; Bollman, J.M., Milich, R., Harris, M.J., Maras, M.A., A friend in need: The role of friendship quality as a protective factor in peer victimization and bullying (2005) Journal of Interpersonal Violence, 20, pp. 701-712; Buss, A.H., Perry, M., The aggression questionnaire (1992) Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 63, pp. 452-459; Carnagey, N.L., Anderson, C.A., Bushman, B.J., The effect of video game violence on physiological desensitization to real-life violence (2007) Journal of Experimental Social Psychology, 43, pp. 489-496; Cole, H., Griffiths, M.D., Social interactions in massive multiplayer online role-playing gamers (2007) CyberPsychology & Behavior, 10, pp. 575-583; Cook, W.L., Kenny, D.A., The actor-partner interdependence model: A model of bidirectional effects in developmental studies (2005) International Journal of Behavioral Development, 29, pp. 101-109; Crawford, G., Light, B., Gosling, V.K., (2011) Online gaming in context: The social and cultural significance of online games, , New York, NY, Routledge; Crick, N.R., Dodge, K.A., A review and reformulation of social information-processing mechanisms in children’s social adjustment (1994) Psychological Bulletin, 115, pp. 74-101; Deleuze, J., Christiaens, M., Nuyens, F., Billieux, J., Shoot at first sight!

We analyze the rivalry between the Atari Video Computer System (VCS)—the best-known member of the “second generation” of home videogame consoles—and Intellivision, which was the Atari VCS’s key competitor for most of this period. Through this analysis, we hope to provide conceptual tools for rethinking the notions of platform, culture, and context in platform studies. In particular, we seek to link the two main ways platforms are currently understood—“computing platforms” like the Atari VCS or Flash and “social platforms” like FaceBook or YouTube. Online sociality is increasingly “platform sociality” in some form. Understanding platforms not just in “context,” but as shaped by rivalries not ontologically subsequent to the platforms themselves, is vital to responding to these emerging formations. © The Author(s) 2017.","context; culture; history; platform studies; rivalry; video games",,,,,,,,,"Altice, N., (2015) I am error: The Nintendo family computer/entertainment system platform, , Cambridge, MA, MIT Press; Apperley, T., Parikka, J., Platform studies’ epistemic threshold (2015) Games and Culture, pp. 1-21; Beard, F., Comparative advertising wars: An historical analysis of their causes and consequences (2010) Journal of Macromarketing, 30, pp. 270-286; Bergson, H., (1911) Creative evolution, , New York, NY, Henry Holt; Bloom, S., (1982) Video invaders, , New York, NY, Arco Publications; Bogost, I., Montfort, N., (2009) Platform studies: Frequently questioned answers, , http://escholarship.org/uc/item/01r0k9br, Proceedings of the Digital Arts and Culture Conference, Retrieved from; Bolter, J., Grusin, R., (1999) Remediation: Understanding new media, , Cambridge, MA, MIT Press; Bourdieu, P., (1977) Outline of a theory of practice, , Cambridge, MA, Cambridge University Press; Burke, P., Context in context (2002) Common Knowledge, 8, pp. 152-177; Burton, R., The latest news from November 1980 (2014) Retro Gamer, 127, pp. 16-17; Dillon, R., (2011) The golden age of video games, , Boca Raton, FL, A K PEters/CRC Press; Dourish, P., What we talk about when we talk about context (2004) Personal and Ubiquitous Computing, 8, pp. 19-30; Fleming, J., The history of Activision (2007) Gamasutra, , http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/1537/the_history_of_activision.php, 7, 30, Retrieved from; Geertz, C., The impact of the concept of culture on the concept of man (1973) The interpretation of cultures, pp. 33-54. , New York, NY, Basic Books, (., –; Geertz, C., From the native’s point of view”: On the nature of anthropological understanding (1983) Local knowledge: Further essays in interpretive anthropology, pp. 55-72. , New York, NY, Basic Books, (., –; Gillespie, T., Governance of and by platforms (2017) SAGE handbook of social media, pp. 1-20. , Burgess J., Poell T., Marwick A., (eds), London, England, Sage, (Eds.), (., –; Harris, B., (2015) Console wars: Sega, Nintendo, and the battle that defined a generation, , New York, NY, HarperCollins; Herman, L., (2001) Phoenix: The rise and fall of videogames, , 3rd ed, Springfield, NJ, Rolenta Press; (2016) Intellivision system changer support modification, , http://wiki.intellivision.us/index.php?title=Intellivision_System_Changer_Support_Modification, Retrieved September 19, 2016, from; Jones, S., Thiruvathukal, G., (2012) Codename revolution: The Nintendo Wii platform, , Cambridge, MA, MIT Press; Katz, A., Yates, L., (1996) Inside electronic game design, , Rocklin, CA, Prima Publishing; Konzack, L., (2002) Computer game criticism: A method for computer game analysis, pp. 89-100. , Proceedings of the Computer Games and Digital Culture Conference, Tampere, Finland; Leorke, D., Rebranding the platform: The limitations of “platform studies.

This study conducted a series of interviews (N = 15) and collected online social forum reports of gameplay (N = 880), in order to determine what the social outcomes of play may be and what mechanisms might be facilitating the social connectedness. Thematic analysis revealed that playing PGO produced a sense of belonging, linked to a sense of place, as well as facilitating conversations with strangers and strengthening social ties. This was due to the use of accessible technology able to be integrated into daily routines, shared passion for the game, and mechanics that encouraged players out of their homes. “Shared passion” was tied to the nostalgic connection many players felt for the franchise. This study shows how gameplay can build social connectedness through real-world engagement. © The Author(s) 2017.","augmented reality; geo-mapping; self-determination theory; sense of belonging; social connectedness; social play; video games",,,,,,"Movember Foundation","We would like to thank the participants for their time and input and the MindMax Initiative (funded by the Movember Foundation) for supporting this research.",,"Althoff, T., White, R.W., Horvitz, E., (2016) Influence of Pokémon Go on physical activity: Study and implications, , https://arxiv.org/pdf/1610.02085v1.pdf, Retrieved October 15, 2016, from; Braun, V., Clarke, V., Using thematic analysis in psychology (2006) Qualitative Research in Psychology, 3, pp. 77-101; Cattell, V., Dines, N., Gesler, W., Curtis, S., Mingling, observing, and lingering: Everyday public spaces and their implications for well-being and social relations (2008) Health & Place, 14, pp. 544-561; Cheung, W.-Y., Wildschut, T., Sedikides, C., Hepper, E.G., Arndt, J., Vingerhoets, A.J.J.M., Back to the future: Nostalgia increases optimism (2013) Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, 39, pp. 1484-1496. , http://psp.sagepub.com/content/39/11/1484.abstractN2, Retrieved from; Crane, P., Dee, M., Young people, public space and new urbanism (2001) Youth Studies Australia, 20, pp. 11-18. , http://search.informit.com.au/documentSummary;dn=200109147;res=IELAPA, Retrieved from; Crenshaw, N., Nardi, B., (2016) It was more than just the game, it was the community”: Social affordances in online games, , Paper presented at the 49th Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences, Hawaii; Deci, E.L., Ryan, R.M., The “what” and “why” of goal pursuits: Human needs and the self-determination of behavior (2000) Psychological Inquiry, 11, pp. 227-268; Hagerty, B.M., Williams, R.A., Coyne, J.C., Early, M.R., Sense of belonging and indicators of social and psychological functioning (1996) Archives of Psychiatric Nursing, 10 (4), pp. 235-244. , http://dx.doi.org/http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0883-9417(96)80029-X; Hawkley, L.C., Browne, M.W., Cacioppo, J.T., How can I connect with thee?

Ludification is usually associated with the construction of ludic identities and cultural practices in the usage of new media or with application of game elements in nongame contexts known as gamification. This overlooks, on the one hand, the influence of cinematic aesthetics on computer games and, on the other hand, the extent to which play aspects and computer game elements imprint and transform the narrative compositional structures of modern cinema. The present study’s investigation will present an expanded conceptualization of ludification, classified by playfulness and gamefulness through interactive/noninteractive properties, aesthetic forms of expressions, and narrative compositions under the respective headings of gamification and cinemafication. These efforts unearth five traits of computer game influences on contemporary cinema presented under the headings, (1) play worlds, (2) ludified quests, (3) controller and interfaces, (4) play experience, and (5) game structure. © The Author(s) 2017.","aesthetics; cinemafication; computer game; gamification; interactivity; ludification; narrative; play",,,,,,,,,"Aarseth, E., (2003) Playing research: Methodological approaches to game analysis, , Proceedings of Digital Arts and Culture Conference, Game Aroaches/Spil-veje, August 28–29, 2003; Bateson, G., (1987) Steps to an ecology of mind, , London, England, Jason Aronson; Bogost, I., Persuasive games: Exploitationware (2011) Gamasutra, , http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/134735/persuasive_games_exploitationware.php, Retrieved December 4, 2015, from, In; Bogost, I., Why gamification is bullshit (2014) The gameful world, pp. 65-80. , Walz P.S., Deterding S., (eds), Cambridge, MA, MIT Press, (Eds.), (., –; Bolter, J.D., Grusin, R., (2000) Remediation: Understanding new media, , Cambridge, MA, MIT Press; Burgun, K., Randomness and game design (2014) Keithburgun.net, , http://keithburgun.net/randomness-and-game-design/, Retrieved August 2, 2017, from; Burgun, K., (2015) Clockwork game design, , Bington, MA, Focal Press, Taylor & Francis; Caillois, R., (2001) Man, play and games, , Urbana, University of Illinois Press, Original work published 1958; Costikyan, G., (2002) I have no words & I must design: Toward a critical vocabulary for games, , Proceedings of Computer Games and Digital Cultures Conference, Tampere University Press, Finland; Costikyan, G., (2007) Games, storytelling, and breaking the string at electronic book review, , http://www.electronicbookreview.com/thread/firstperson/storyish, Retrieved December 4, 2015, from; Costikyan, G., (2013) Uncertainty in games.

Earlier research often claims that relationships between users and their avatars are, by nature, strong and intense. By analyzing individuals who conducted paid labor in a number of public institutions in a virtual world, this article argues that the frame of work heavily influenced the professional users’ experiences of using an avatar. The user–avatar relationship was mainly related to how and why the user entered the virtual world, their position in their off-line and online workplaces and, as a result, related to aspects of power and control over the framing of the online arena. Because of these factors, many of the professional users regarded their avatar more as a second suit than, as has often been argued, a second self. © The Author(s) 2017.","avatar; labour; Second Life; virtual work; virtual worlds",,,,,,,,,"Angerer, M., Space does matter: On cyber and other bodies (1999) European Journal of Cultural Studies, 2, pp. 209-229; Axelsson, A., The digital divide: Status difference in virtual environments (2002) The social life of avatars: Presence and interaction in a shared virtual environments, pp. 188-204. , SchroederLondon, England, Springer, (Ed.), (., –; Bailenson, J.N., Beall, A.C., Transformed social interaction: Exploring the digital plasticity of avatars (2006) Avatars at work and play: Collaborations and interaction in shared virtual environments, pp. 1-16. , Schroeder & AxelssonCambridge, MA, Springer, (Eds.), (., –; Banakou, D., Chorianopoulos, K., The effects of avatars gender and appearance on social behaviour in Online 3D Virtual Worlds (2010) Journal of Virtual Worlds Research, 4, pp. 3-16; Bengtsson, S., Virtual nation branding: The Swedish embassy in second life (2011) Journal of Virtual Worlds Research, 4, pp. 1-26; Bengtsson, S., Virtual technologies of the nation-state: State administration in second life (2012) Cultural technologies: The shaping of culture in media and society, pp. 271-297. , Bolin G., (ed), London, England, Routledge, (Ed.), (., –; Bengtsson, S., The producer as vendor: Producing public space in a virtual world (2013) Producing the Internet: Platforms, communities, actors, pp. 165-184. , Olsson T., (ed), Gothenburg, Sweden, Nordicom, (Ed.), (., –; Bengtsson, S., The presentation of self in a virtual world: working in Second Life (2016) Virtual Workers and the Global Labour Market, , Webster J., Randle K., (eds), London, Palgrave Macmillan, (Eds; Blascovich, J., Social influence within immersive virtual environments (2002) The social life of avatars: Presence and interaction in a shared virtual environments, pp. 127-145. , SchroederLondon, England, Springer, (Ed.), (., –; Boellstorff, T., (2008) Coming of age in second life, , Princeton, NJ, Princeton University Press; Brown, B., Bell, M., Play and sociability in there: Some lessons from online games for collaborative virtual environments (2006) Avatars at work and play: Collaborations and interaction in shared virtual environments, pp. 227-246. , Schroeder & AxelssonCambridge, MA, Springer, (Eds.), (., –; Castronova, E., (2007) Exodus to the virtual world: How online fun is changing reality, , New York, NY, Palgrave Macmillan; Cheng, L., Farnham, S., Stone, L., Lessons learned: Building and deploying shared virtual environments (2002) The social life of avatars: Presence and interaction in a shared virtual environments, pp. 90-111. , SchroederLondon, England, Springer, (Ed.), (., –; Couldry, N., (2003) Media rituals: A critical approach, , London, England, Routledge; Ducheneaut, N., Wen, M.H., Yee, N., Wadley, G., (2009) Body and mind: A study of avatar personalization in three virtual worlds, pp. 1151-1160. , Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors Computing Systems, ACM, (., –; Dumitrica, D., Gaden, G., Knee-high boots and Six-Pack Abs: Autoethnographic reflections on gender and technology in second life (2009) Journal of Virtual Worlds Research, 1, pp. 3-23; Dunn, R.A., Guadagno, R.E., My avatar and me: Gender and personality predictors of avatar-self discrepancy (2012) Computers in Human Behavior, 28, pp. 97-106; Flanagan, M., Navigating the narrative in space: Gender and spatiality in virtual worlds (2000) Art Journal, 59, pp. 74-85; Garau, M., Selective fidelity: Investigative priorities for the creation of expressive avatars (2006) Avatars at work and play: Collaborations and interaction in shared virtual environments, pp. 17-38. , Schroeder & AxelssonCambridge, MA, Springer, (Eds.), (., –; Glazer, N., Architecture and the virtual world (2005) Peer-Reviewed Journal on the Internet, , Special Issue #5: Virtual Architecture at State of Play III, October 6–8, 2005; Goffman, E., (1959) The presentation of self in everyday life, , New York, NY, Doubleday; Goffman, E., (1974) Frame analysis: An essay on the organization of experience, , Boston, MA, Northeastern University Press; Goffman, E., The interaction order.

In this article, I focus on the nature of the moral problems it presents to the player with the help of the notion of “wicked problems.” Using four case studies from two games that heavily rely on ethical gameplay, I will differentiate between four kinds of moral problems arising from ethical gameplay: tame moral problems, semiwicked problems, real wicked problems, and super wicked problems, each of which present a greater (moral) challenge to the player. © The Author(s) 2017.","ethical gameplay; Fallout 3; Mass Effect (video game series); moral dilemmas; morality system; wicked problem",,,,,,,,,"(2007) Bioshock, , [PC game], Novato, CA, 2 K Games; (2013) Metro Last Light, , [PC, Xbox, Xbox One, PlayStation 3, Playstation 4 game], Planegge, Germany, Deep Silver; (2008) Fallout 3, , [PC game], Rockville, MD, Bethesda Softworks; (2007) Mass effect, , [Pc game], Edmonton, Canada, Microsoft Game Studios, & Electronic Arts; (2010) Mass effect 2, , [PC game], Edmonton, Canada, Electronic Arts; (2012) Mass effect 3, , [PC game], Edmonton, Canada, Electronic Arts; Birch, A., The problem of morality in videogames (2014) Den of Geek, , http://www.denofgeek.com/games/29837/the-problem-of-morality-in-videogames, Retrieved September 7, 2016, from, In; Bosman, F., The Word has become Game.

One of these conversations began in late 2012 on the social networking platform Twitter when a user posed the question, “Why are there so few lady game creators?” Using the hashtag #1ReasonWhy, Twitter users from across the game industry and game-playing communities contributed to a discussion about what women experience in public and online game-playing spaces, at game industry events, in game industry workplaces, and in the media. This article examines the #1ReasonWhy conversation to uncover how members of the game industry and of game communities account for why so few women choose to pursue and stay in game industry careers. Better understanding, women’s experiences can aid researchers, educators, and game industry stakeholders in theorizing how to make meaningful and strategic improvements to game cultures and industry spaces. © The Author(s) 2017.","diversity;

Discourse analyses of semistructured interview texts found that video game developers operate under an internalized pressure to create game narratives that are quickly understandable and, thus, sellable. This pressure is normatively internalized in the profession as an attempt to hedge against market uncertainty. Video game developers, therefore, depend on social beliefs from the “real world” to inform how video game players might receive their games as well as narratives and themes from past texts such as the works of J. R. R. Tolkien. Therefore, this article argues that racism might be enabled because it is believed to be a hedge against market uncertainty. © The Author(s) 2017.","culture industry; economics; norms; race; video game industry",,,,,,,,,"Anderson, E., Gatignon, H., Firms and the creation of new markets (2005) Handbook of new institutional economics, pp. 401-431. , Menard C., Shirley M.M., (eds), Dordrecht, the Netherlands, Springer, (Eds.), (., –;

Meanwhile, increasing attention has been paid to top international electronic sports (eSports) tournaments in which competitive pressure is becoming increasingly more serious. Therefore, how to win such games is a problem worth exploring. This article proposes a set of evaluation indicators for testing gameplay in Defense of the Ancients 2, which is a popular multiplayer online game. The analysis shows that the multiplayer killing indicator is an effective predictor of the game result. Furthermore, the evaluation indicators are divided into two categories: operational skills and tactical awareness. The functions of the indicators in each category are discussed. The results show that, for professional eSports teams, tactical awareness affects the multiplayer killing indicator and the game result more so than operational skills. © The Author(s) 2017.","Dota 2; effective predictor; multiplayer; operational skills; tactical awareness",,,,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC: 71640034, 71420107025

Housed in the genre of adventure games, The Walking Dead: Season Two and Life Is Strange appear to follow in the spirit of this emerging women’s revolution but inevitably reestablish traditional presentations of sexism in the treatment of their endings. In particular, the presentation of the infamous Trolley Problem and its inherent utilitarian framework is an incendiary moment wherein these games mark rebellious women as necessary sacrifices for the greater good and the continuation of the community. This article explores these two specific moments of sacrifice at the conclusions of Life Is Strange and The Walking Dead: Season Two and engages with tensions between the status quo and the resistances that challenges these norms. © The Author(s) 2017.","adventure games; binary choices; close reading; damsels in distress; endgames; ethical dilemmas; ethics of care; feminist ethics; gender representation; Life Is Strange; rebel girls; save and sacrifice; the Trolley Problem; The Walking Dead; utilitarianism",,,,,,,,,"Ahmed, S., (2010) The promise of happiness, , Durham, England, Duke University Press; Ashford, E., Utilitarianism, integrity and partiality (2000) The Journal of Philosophy, 97, pp. 421-439; Brenkert, G.G., Marx’s critique of utilitarianism (1981) Canadian Journal of Philosophy, 7, pp. 193-220; Butler, J., (1990) Gender trouble, , New York, NY, Routledge; Butt, M., Apperley, T., Vivian James—The identity politics of #Gamergate’s Avatar (2016) DiGRA/FDG ‘16—Abstract Proceedings of the First International Joint Conference of DiGRA and FDG, 13. , http://www.digra.org/wp-content/uploads/digital-library/paper_154.pdf, Retrieved from; Cassell, J., Jenkins, H., Chess for girls?

This article explores the argument put forward by the Red Cross and its reception by games media organizations, in order to consider how the concept of “just war” is represented within games.

Rather than a formal analysis of the game, our objective was to situate the research in game production studies by documenting the design context (gamework) and designer perceptions about the game that inform morally complex gameplay. The research was conducted with four team members of 11 bit studios: a senior game designer, a writer, a senior writer (with stakes in marketing), and a quality assurance lead. We employed reflective interviewing techniques and visual methods to better understand how moral gameplay was designed. Our analysis illustrates the roles underlying narratives in the design process and balancing everyday work negotiations play in the design of moral gameplay, how a designer’s research informs the vision to create emotional realism in the game, and the importance of a player-centered iterative design process to produce morally engaging gameplay. © The Author(s) 2017.","focus group; moral game design; production studies; visual methods; war games",,,,,,"Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek, NWO: 022-005-017, 314-99-106","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: Part of this work is funded by the Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO), project numbers 314-99-106 and 022-005-017.",,"(2014) This war of mine, , Computer Game, Poland, Author Warsaw, [,]; (2016) This war of mine—The little ones DLC, , Computer Game, Poland, Author Warsaw, [,]; Ash, J., Attention, videogames and the retentional economies of affective amplification (2012) Theory, Culture & Society, 29, pp. 3-26; Birdwell, B., (1999) The cabal: Valve’s design process for creating half-life, , http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/131815/the_cabal_valves_design_process_php, Retrieved from; Bourdieu, P., Johnson, R., (1993) The field of cultural production: Essays on art and literature, , 2nd ed, New York, NY, Columbia University Press; Braun, V., Clarke, V., Using thematic analysis in psychology (2006) Qualitative Research in Psychology, 3, pp. 77-101; Crogan, P., (2011) Gameplay mode: War, simulation, and technoculture, , Minneapolis, University of Minnesota Press; Cross, N., (2011) Design thinking: Understanding how designers think and work, , London, England, Bloomsbury; de Smale, S., (2016) Game essays as critical media and research praxis, , 8, 1–6, Proceedings of Digital Games Research Association and Foundations of Digital Games, 2016 Conference, Dundee, Scotland, Tampere, Finland, DiGRA Library, (,)., In; Deuze, M., Martin, C.B., Allen, C., The professional identity of gameworkers (2007) Convergence, 13, pp. 335-353; Dyer-Witheford, N., De Peuter, G., (2009) Games of empire: Global capitalism and video games, , Minneapolis, University of Minnesota Press; Eklund, L., Focus group interviews as a way to evaluate and understand game play experiences (2015) Game research methods, pp. 133-148. , Lankoski P., Björk S., (eds), Pittsburg, CA, ETC Press, (Eds.), (., –; Flanagan, M., Nissenbaum, H., (2014) Values at play in digital games, , Cambridge, MA, MIT Press; Fullerton, T., (2008) Game design workshop: A playcentric approach to creating innovative games, , Boca Raton, FL, CRC Press; Galloway, A.R., (2006) Gaming: Essays on algorithmic culture, , Minneapolis, MN, University of Minnesota Press; (2015) G4C15, , https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnRAQlbqTjw, Video File, Retrieved from, [,]; Guevara-Villalobos, O., (2011) Cultures of independent game production: Examining the relationship between community and labour, , 1, Proceedings of DiGRA 2011 Conference: Think Design Play, Tampere, Finland, DiGRA Library, (,)., In; Independent game festival winners (2015) Independent Game Festival, , http://igf.com/2015, Retrieved from; (2003) Call of duty, , Computer Game, Santa Monica, CA, Activision, [,]; Julier, G., (2006) From visual culture to design culture.

How can we solve moral problems? One possible way is to create and use moral learning games, or games that enable players to work on moral scenarios, make moral choices, and gain relevant skills. One possible subcategory of these games is moral knowledge games, or games that aim to solve real-world moral problems and create new knowledge about morality. This article systematically analyzes relevant literature and related games and media to uncover a preliminary set of design principles for creating moral learning games and moral knowledge games. Frameworks such as the Elemental Tetrad, Mechanics, Dynamics, and Aesthetics (MDA), and Ethics Practice and Implementation Categorization Framework (EPIC) were used to analyze individual games and media. Ten different categories of principles emerged, along with 95 possible subprinciples.

Moral development involves training and integrating both types of cognitive processes through a mix of instruction, practice, and reflection. Serious games are an ideal platform for this kind of moral training, as they provide safe spaces for exploring difficult moral problems and practicing the skills necessary to resolve them. In this article, we present Morality Play, a model for the design of serious games for ethical expertise development based on the Integrative Ethical Education framework from moral psychology and the Lens of the Toy model for serious game design. © The Author(s) 2017.","design;

A lack of MS may lead people to behave unethically, without awareness for their actions’ moral implications. In this study, we conduct a theory-based evaluation of 20 distinct game mechanisms in view of their potential to promote MS. MS is thereby operationalized in terms of three learning outcomes (LOs): empathic concern for relevant groups, alertness to values/principles, and awareness for one’s vulnerability to biases. This study suggests that MS is best promoted through a careful combination of game mechanisms, addressing all three LOs. © The Author(s) 2017.","ethics; game-based learning; moral awareness; moral education; moral sensitivity",,,,,,"Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur FÃ¶rderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung, SNSF","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This research was supported by Grant No. CR11I1_159279/ 1 from the Swiss National Science Foundation.",,"Batson, C., Polycarpou, M., Harmon-Jones, E., Imhoff, H., Mitchener, E., Bednar, L., Empathy and attitudes: Can feeling for a member of a stigmatized group improve feelings toward the group?

Comparatively, little is known about why players quit. Rather than assuming MMOG play begins and ends with personal interest, this article uses a leisure studies framework to account for barriers and participation to play. Drawing on survey responses from 133 former EVE Online players, this article demonstrates that quitting is not a strict binary where one moves from playing to not playing. Furthermore, quitting in the context of MMOGs is not always a definitive act as some players will leave and then return to a particular game numerous times.

I argue for an understanding of the potato as a biotechnological product, drawing from a range of contemporary and historical texts to establish its role in a long history of exploitation and social inequality. These aspects enable the game’s establishment of a cohesive narrative in which potato science originates Aperture Science’s ascent and growing corruption, in a trajectory that culminates in its brutal exploitation of human test subjects. The game also celebrates rebellion against that corruption through the dynamics of gameplay and the development of its main character as a rival biological power. © The Author(s) 2016.","Portal; agriculture; biotechnology; potato; science",,,,,,,,,"Behrsin, P., Data release: Failed CA Prop. 37 (GMO labeling)—Funding profile ($55 M raised) (2013) Maplight, , http://maplight.org/data-release/data-release-failed-ca-prop-37-gmo-labeling-funding-profile-55m-raised, 03, 9, Retrieved from; Bogost, I., (2007) Persuasive games: The expressive power of videogames, , Cambridge, MA, MIT Press; Borel, B., The first GMO field tests (2014) Modern Farmer, , http://modernfarmer.com/2014/05/even-first-gmo-field-tests-controversial-will-ever-end-fight/, 05, 20, Retrieved from; Burden, M., Gouglas, S., The algorithmic experience: Portal as art (2012) Game Studies, 12. , http://gamestudies.org, Retrieved from; Bradshaw, J.E., Potato-breeding strategy (2007) Potato biology and biotechnology: Advances and perspectives, pp. 157-178. , Vreugdenhil D., (ed), Amsterdam, the Netherlands, Elsevier, (Ed.), (., –; Consalvo, M., (2007) Cheating: Gaining advantage in videogames, , Cambridge, MA, MIT Press; Creager, A.N.H., (2002) The life of a virus: Tobacco mosaic virus as an experimental model, 1930-1965, , Chicago, IL, University of Chicago Press; Franklin, S., (2007) Dolly mixtures: The remaking of genealogy, , Durham, NC, Duke University Press; Gallagher, C., Greenblatt, S., The potato in the materialist imagination (2000) Practicing new historicism, pp. 110-135. , Chicago, IL, University of Chicago Press, (., –; Galloway, A.R., (2006) Gaming: Essays on algorithmic culture, , Minneapolis, MN, University of Minnesota Press; There’s a hole in the sky [forum post] (2011) Giant Bomb, , http://www.giantbomb.com/portal-2/3030-21662/forums/theres-a-hole-in-the-sky-492338/, Retrieved from; Garrett, B.C., The Colorado potato beetle goes to war (1996) Chemical Weapons Convention Bulletin, 33, pp. 2-3; Haraway, D., (1997) Modest_witness_@_second_millenium.femaleman © meets oncomouse™: Feminism and technoscience, , New York, NY, Routledge; Jones, S.E., (2008) The meaning of video games: Gaming and textual strategies, , New York, NY, Routledge; Kohler, R.E., (1994) Lords of the fly: Drosophila genetics and the experimental life, , Chicago, IL, The University of Chicago Press; Maugh, T.H., II, Plants used in UC’s genetic engineering test uprooted (1987) Los Angeles Times, , http://articles.latimes.com/1987-05-27/news/mn-1767_1_plants, 05, 27, Retrieved from; McHugh, S., Flora, not fauna: GM culture and agriculture (2007) Literature and Medicine, 26, pp. 25-54; Milburn, C., (2015) Mondo nano: Fun and games in the world of digital matter, , Durham, NC, Duke University Press; Millam, S., Developments in transgenic biology and the genetic engineering of useful traits (2007) Potato biology and biotechnology: Advances and perspectives, pp. 669-686. , Vreugdenhil D., (ed), Amsterdam, the Netherlands, Elsevier, (Ed.), (., –; (2006) McDonald’s Videogame, , http://www.mcvideogame.com, [online game].

I find that between 1995 and 2001, Chinese online games were mostly developed by amateurs, noncommercial, and considerably creative. Between 2002 and 2005, industrial growth allowed some room for local creativity despite commercialization and dominance of imported games. Current scholarly, business, and media discourses unfairly ignore creativity in these first two periods and yet praise the Chinese game industry’s commercial success since the late 2000s. I challenge these discourses by illustrating that between 2006 and early 2009, a new, ethically dubious, and uniquely Chinese business model emerged, became domestically dominant, and quietly and profoundly impacted on global online game design.

We investigate how game structures, including the presence of choice, a game’s length, and avatar presentation, push players in particular ways and also how players use those systems for their own ends. We explore how players “rehearse their ethos” through gameplay and how they are continually pushing back against the magic circle. It is based on two-dozen semi-structured interviews with players conducted in 2012. It illustrates that there are no clear-cut answers—game structures, including narratives, character designs, length, or save systems, can push players to act in certain ways that may or may not align with their own beliefs and goals. © The Author(s) 2016.","ethics; interviews; magic circle; morality; players; qualitative methods; RPGs",,,,,,"Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada, SSHRC","The author(s) received no financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.

This article points to the leaderboard and the ability to broadcast messages to other users through player usernames as the primary reason for the game’s success as a platform for users to broadcast messages. Agar.io, through usernames and omnipresent leaderboards broadcasting these names, affords players the chance to put their ideologies and allegiances in competition through a simulation of a “survival of the fittest” cell culture.

In this essay, I will look at significant parallels between casual games and otome games and point out the ways in which both define women as players and consumers of games. By focusing on Mystic Messenger, I examine the ways in which the game’s real-time simulation of emotional labor becomes a way of policing women’s desires, a way of reinforcing nurturing roles over women’s desires, and a way of literally commodifying the assumedly female player’s leisure time. Furthermore, I also examine player practices and discussions of cheating within the player community, tagging these as light forms of resistances and ways in which various individuals in the community assert their identity and their agency over their own time. © The Author(s) 2018.","casual games; cheating; gender in games; Mystic Messenger; otome games; romance in games; women",,,,,,,,,"Anable, A., Casual games, time management, and the work of affect (2013) ADA: Journal of Gender, New Media & Technology, 6. , http://adanewmedia.org/2013/6/issue2-anable/, Retrieved from; Azuma, H., (2009) Otaku: Japan’s database animals, , Abel Jonathan, Kono Sion, (eds), Minneapolis, University of Minnesota Press, (, Trans; Chen, L.C., What’s the cultural difference between the West and the East?

To date, investigations of these games are typically focused on the rate of attrition or “churn,” reinforcing the idea that SNG players exist to make the developer money rather than participating in a game they derive pleasure from. Seeking to recenter the player in research about SNGs, this article reports on a survey of former players (N = 147) who were queried about their reason(s) for no longer participating in YoWorld, a Facebook-based SNG. Findings indicate that players typically quit because of external constraints to their leisure time rather than no longer interested in the game, which are not barriers to play that can be overcome by personalized in-game incentives, the typical developer response to prevent churn from taking place. © The Author(s) 2018.","churn; Facebook games; player studies; quitting; social network games; YoVille; YoWorld",,,,,,"Mitacs","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was supported by a MITACS Accelerate Postdoctoral Research Award.",,"Bartle, R., Hearts, clubs, diamonds, spades: Players who suit MUDs (1996) Journal of MUD Research, , http://www.mud.co.uk/richard/hcds.htm, Retrieved from; Begy, J., Consalvo, M., Achievements, motivations and rewards in Faunasphere (2011) Game Studies, 11. , http://gamestudies.org/1101/articles/begy_consalvo, Retrieved from; Bergstrom, K., (2015) To play or not to play: Non/Participation in EVE Online, , (PhD dissertation), York University, Toronto, Canada; Bergstrom, K., Barriers to play: Accounting for non-participation in digital game play (2018) Feminist Media Studies, pp. 1-17; Bergstrom, K., Temporary break or permanent departure?

The article begins by identifying the dearth of literature on paper puzzle games and offers an initial examination of these games through the lens of casual games, play, and players. It focuses on six traits in casual game design: appealing themes, ease of access, ease of learning, minimal required expertise, fast rewards, and temporal flexibility. It demonstrates that—from a perspective of mechanics, demographics, and contexts of play—paper puzzle games are excellent examples of casual games and therefore important to fully study.

We are undertaking this project to broaden the corpus of Games Studies by both critiquing casual as a label, yet simultaneously legitimizing it as an important category of both study and play. Additionally, historicizing the terms casual and hardcore as categories uncovers the ways that the video game industry talks about its products and how academic work often replicates biases against casual games. To this end, we argue that the centrality of core games pushes many important texts to the margins. It is our goal, within this special issue, to revalue and reconsider the role of casual games within the larger ecology of game studies. © The Author(s) 2018.","casual games; diversity; gamer; hardcore games; midcore games",,,,,,,,,"amanda, B., Filthy casual (2013) Know Your Meme, , http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/filthy-casual, Retrieved from; Biedrzycki, M., Defining midcore games and why they matter (2017) Gamasutra, , https://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/MaciejBiedrzycki/20171115/309666/Defining_midcore_games_and_why_they_matter.php, Retrieved from; Core and casual: What’s the difference?

Although conceptually similar to many behavioral addictions, there is still no clear consensus on how to best measure and assess problem video game playing. This study validates one proposed measure of problem video gaming—the Problem Video Game Playing Test (PVGT)—in a Canadian undergraduate university student sample. Multivariate results indicate that problem video gaming is positively associated with the average length of time spent gaming, social alienation, and online gaming motives such as competition, escape, coping, recreation, and socializing; but, contrary to the gateway hypothesis, problem gambling and several of its mental health correlates—depression, anxiety, and stress—are not associated with problem video gaming as measured by the PVGT.

Exploring the layered and complex forms of video game design and aesthetics is a growing area of gaming studies that is pointing toward these larger and important questions, even changing the way gaming studies is being approached by scholars. This article examines the relationship between video games’ design and aesthetics and Derrida’s conceptual framework of hauntology. Using Mannon and Temkin’s definition of glitch aesthetics, I conduct a close visual analysis of Tacoma as a case study in how Derrida’s hauntology is present within video games.

It is not known which aspects of games are valued by players, regardless of whether they have a disability. We report on a survey of 71 players from the general game community and 123 players with disabilities asking what makes games important to them. We found established motivations to play such as social connection and escapism but additionally that players find games beneficial and provide artistic experiences. Players with disabilities explicitly referred to games helping them to feel enabled or being on a level footing with nondisabled players. The value of accessible games is not just mere play but playing the same games as everyone else. This implies that achieving accessibility through adapting games is an important approach to provide the valued connection and enablement that games provide. © The Author(s) 2019.","accessible games; digital games; player experience; players with disabilities",,,,,,"University of York","The authors would like to thank all of the participants who contributed their time to this study.

Research suggests the thrill from gambling comes from associated increases in physiological arousal not possible monetary gains. Gamers performing microtransactions to purchase loot boxes can lead to similar increases in physiological arousal. However, problematic gamblers no longer receive increases in arousal and become hyposensitive to reward. This hyposensitivity may also be present in problematic gamers. Twenty-five adult male participants took part in the within-participant design experiment measuring heart rate (HR) and galvanic skin response (GSR) while they were gaming and performing a microtransaction. GSR increased from baseline. HR decreased while performing a microtransaction. There was a negative correlation between gaming addiction scores and participants’ physiological arousal. The increases in arousal suggest microtransactions in gaming could potentially lead to problematic levels of use, while hyposensitivity could explain the higher gaming addiction relating to lower arousal during gameplay. © The Author(s) 2019.","arousal; gambling; gaming; loot boxes; microtransaction",,,,,,,,,"Anderson, G., Brown, R., Real and laboratory gambling, sensation-seeking and arousal (1984) British Journal of Psychology, 75, p. 401; Barton, K.R., Yazdani, Y., Ayer, N., Kalvapalle, S., Brown, S., Stapleton, J., The effect of losses disguised as wins and near misses in electronic gaming machines: A systematic review (2017) Journal of Gambling Studies, 33, pp. 1241-1260. , …; Baudinet, J., Blaszczynski, A., Arousal and gambling mode preference: A review of the literature (2013) Journal of Gambling Studies, 29, pp. 343-358; Bechara, A., Damasio, A.R., Damasio, H., Anderson, S.W., Insensitivity to future consequences following damage to human prefrontal cortex (1994) Cognition, 50, pp. 7-15; Binde, P., Romild, U., Volberg, R.A., Forms of gambling, gambling involvement and problem gambling: Evidence from a Swedish population survey (2017) International Gambling Studies, 17, pp. 490-507; Brown, R.I.F., Arousal and sensation-seeking components in the general explanation of gambling and gambling addictions (1986) The International Journal of the Addictions, 21, pp. 1001-1016; Cohen, J., A power primer (1992) Psychological Bulletin, 112, pp. 155-159; Coventry, K.R., Norman, A.C., Arousal, sensation seeking and frequency of gambling in off-course horse racing bettors (1997) British Journal of Psychology, 88, p. 671; Delfabbro, P., King, D., Lambos, C., Puglies, S., Is video-game playing a risk factor for pathological gambling in Australian adolescents?

This method involved the development of an analytical system, online database, and data visualization tool designed to help us understand the evolution of gameplay. Following an overview of these methodological considerations, we present the most common gameplay configurations adopted by adventure games over the years with the help of the data visualization interface. This forms the foundation of a comparative study that seeks to highlight the specificity of French production at the turn of the 1990s. The results shed light on gameplay configurations in a way that effectively articulates a synoptic, macrohistorical perspective with deep inspections of specific games. © The Author(s) 2019.","adventure games; canon selection; data visualization; French games; historical methods; video game history",,,,,,"Fonds de Recherche du Québec-Société et Culture, FRQSC","The authors would like to thank Philippe Bédard for his feedback.

Three distinctions are relevant. First, there is a difference between a fixed-reward microtransaction and a random one, such as a loot box. Second, there is a difference between cosmetic items and those which affect gameplay; this is particularly pronounced in multiplayer games, where a player might have an advantage over another through the expenditure of real money. Third, there is a difference between items which are obtainable both for real money and for in-game effort and items which are only obtainable for real money. Ultimately, all three of these distinctions will prove necessary to show that fixed cosmetic rewards are ethically permissible, random rewards of all types are ethically problematic, and fixed functional rewards can be acceptable, but only under certain conditions. © The Author(s) 2019.","ethics; freemium games; game design; loot boxes; microtransactions; video games",,,,,,,,,"(2018) Research report on loot boxes, , https://www.gamingcommission.be/opencms/export/sites/default/jhksweb_nl/documents/onderzoeksrapport-loot-boxen-Engels-publicatie.pdf, Retrieved from; (2014) Dragon Age: Inquisition, , Redwood City, CA, Electronic Arts; Black, R., Ramsay, H., The ethics of gambling: Guidelines for players and commercial providers (2003) International Gambling Studies, 3, pp. 199-215; (2004) World of Warcraft, , Irvine, CA, Author; (2012) Diablo III, , Irvine, CA, Author; Davidovici-Nora, M., Innovation in business models in the video game industry: Free-to-play or the gaming experience as a service (2013) The Computer Games Journal, 2, pp. 22-51; (2017) Star Wars: Battlefront II, , Redwood City, CA, Electronic Arts; Evers, E.R.K., van de Ven, N., Weeda, D., The hidden cost of microtransactions: Buying in-game advantages in online games decreases a player’s status (2015) International Journal of Internet Science, 10, pp. 20-36; Grundy, D., The presence of stigma among users of the MMORPG RMT: A hypothetical case approach (2008) Games and Culture, 3, pp. 225-247; Guo, H., Hao, L., Mukhopadhyay, T., Sun, D., (2015) Selling virtual currency in digital games: Implications on gameplay and social welfare, , Paper presented at the Theory Economics of Information Systems (TEIS) 2015, Banff, Canada; Hamari, J., Alha, K., Järvelä, S., Kivikangas, J.M., Koivisto, J., Paavilainen, J., Why do players buy in-game content?

The game visually and mechanically represents the economic imaginary of frictionless capitalism, characterized by endless and self-sufficient growth. AdVenture Capitalist has no end and does not require the player’s interaction. The analysis shows that players’ responses to their marginalization from an endless simulation are pataphysical: They privilege the particular over the general, the imaginary over the real, the exceptional over the ordinary, and the contradictory over the axiomatic. In so doing, players occasionally raise imaginary solutions to the end of capitalism. Examining the written traces of players’ disengagement from the simulation, the article intervenes in broader debates regarding the effects of games. It concludes that exceptional cases of overinterpretation reveal a complex transformative approach toward video games and the political and economic ideology represented therein. © The Author(s) 2019.","'pataphysics; automation; idle games; incremental games; interpassivity",,,,,,,,,"Alharthi, S.A., Isaedi, O.A., Toups, Z.O., Tanenbaum, J., Hammer, J., (2018) Playing to wait: A taxonomy of idle games, , Proceedings of CHI 2018, April 21–26, Quebec, Canada; Anable, A., (2018) Playing with feelings: Video games and affect, , Minneapolis, University of Minnesota Press; Baudrillard, J., Pataphysics of the year 2000 (1994) The illusion of the end, pp. 1-9. , Baudrillard J., (ed), Cambridge, England, Polity Press, (Ed.), (., –; Baudrillard, J., (2004) Fragments: Conversations with François L’Yvonnet, , London, England, Routledge; Bogost, I., (2006) Unit operations: An approach to videogame criticism, , Cambridge, MA, MIT Press; Bogost, I., (2010) Cow clicker the making of obsession.

However, the complex, mixed-affect, eudaimonic entertainment experience that is possible when playing a video game—how it is formed, how it is experienced, and how to design for it—has been investigated far less than hedonistic emotional experiences focusing on fun, challenge, and “enjoyment.” Participants volunteered to be interviewed about their mixed-affect emotional experiences of playing avant-garde video games. New conceptions of agency emerged (actual, interpretive, fictional, mechanical) from the analysis of transcripts and were used to produce a framework of four categories of agency. This new framework offers designers and researchers the extra nuance in conversations around agency and contributes to the discussion of how we can design video games that allow for complex, reflective, eudaimonic emotional experiences. © The Author(s) 2019.","agency; digital games; emotion; eudaimonia; grounded theory",,,,,,"EPSRC Centre for Doctoral Training in Medical Imaging: EP/L015846/1","The authors would like to thank Sarah Wiseman (Goldsmiths, University of London) for advice on previous drafts of this article.

Drawing on recent quantitative and qualitative research on avatar use and ongoing scholarship on nineteenth-century literature, we offer theoretical insights about the resonance between historical and contemporary understandings of media consumption as it intersects with cultural notions of sex and gender differences. Theories of sentimentalism help us to reconsider how gender is conceptualized in quantitative studies of avatars. Our cross-disciplinary study of embodiment and visceral experience thus argues for expanding modes of inquiry within quantitative games scholarship to more fully capture the interplay between gender identity and individual factors in avatar experiences. We conclude with three strategies for quantitative games scholars to consider as a means to enrich our understanding of the complexities of gender in modern game contexts. © The Author(s) 2019.","19th-century literature; avatars; digital gaming; emotions; gender; identification; phenomenology; popular culture",,,,,,,,,"Agger, B., (2012) Oversharing: Presentations of self in the Internet age, , New York, NY, Routledge; Agosto, D.E., Abbas, J., Don’t be dumb—That’s the rule I try to live by”: A closer look at older teens’ online privacy and safety attitudes (2017) New Media & Society, 19, pp. 347-365; Anable, A., (2018) Playing with feelings: Video games and affect, , Minneapolis, University of Minnesota Press; Anderson, C.A., Bushman, B.J., Effects of violent video games on aggressive behavior, aggressive cognition, aggressive affect, physiological arousal, and prosocial behavior: A meta-analytic review of the scientific literature (2001) Psychological Science, 12, pp. 353-359; Bailenson, J.N., Blascovich, J., Avatars (2004) Encyclopedia of human-computer interaction, pp. 64-68. , William S.B., (ed), Great Barrington, MA, Berkshire, (Ed.), (., –; Baldwin, K., Virtual avatars: Trans experiences of ideal selves through gaming (2019) Markets, Globalization & Development Review, 3, pp. 1-20; Banks, J., Object, me, symbiote, other: A social typology of player-avatar relationships (2015) First Monday, 20; Banks, J., Bowman, N.D., Emotion, anthropomorphism, realism, control: Validation of a merged metric for player–avatar interaction (PAX) (2016) Computers in Human Behavior, 54, pp. 215-223; Barnett, J., Coulson, M., Virtually real: A psychological perspective on massively multiplayer online games (2010) Review of General Psychology: Journal of Division 1 of the American Psychological Association, 14, pp. 167-179; Baym, N., Rewriting the scribbling women (1985) Legacy, 2, pp. 3-12. , http://www.jstor.org/stable/25678934; Behrenshausen, B.G., The active audience, again: Player-centric game studies and the problem of binarism (2013) New Media & Society, 15, pp. 872-889; Bergstrom, K., Jenson, J., de Castell, S., What’s “choice” got to do with it?

The timeless relevance of its fundamental moral questions, the cosmic dimension of its imaginative power, and the intensity of its realism, all hold unparalleled promise for any kind of adaptation, translation, or transmediation. The Comedy, and especially its first infernal cantica, gets periodically reinvented and transferred into creative outlets that are increasingly technology driven. This article will explore existing gaming adaptations of Dante’s Comedy, to focus on the one hand on textual aspects that are mostly exploited to achieve commercial success and on the other on the potential offered by the text and often marginalized by developers. The article will discuss ways in which new creative approaches would allow for a gaming experience with the authenticity, intensity, and relevance of the “original.”. © The Author(s) 2019.","afterlife; Comedy; Dante; DMC; gamification; inferno; Limbo; medievalism",,,,,,,,,"Alighieri, D., (1949) The divine comedy. 1.

While “the videogame industry” as a sector of the economy accounts for the flow of capital between corporate actors and global markets, as a concept it is insufficient to account for the spectrum of cultural activities and identities that constitute videogame production. In this article, I instead follow Bourdieu to consider videogame production as a cultural field. The videogame field is locally situated and constituted by a contested range of activities and identities implicated in interrelated economic, cultural, and social forces. Drawing from empirical research with videogame makers in Australia, this article’s conceptualization of the videogame field provides ways to better account for the plurality of ways videogames makers navigate economic stability and creative autonomy. © The Author(s) 2019.","creativity; cultural field; labor; precarity; video game industry",,,,,,"Australian Research Council, ARC: DE180100973","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: Research for this article was funded by an Australian Research Council Discovery Early Career Research Award (DE180100973).",,"Anthropy, A., (2012) Rise of the videogame Zinesters, , New York, NY, Seven Stories Press; Apperley, T.H., Golding, D., Australia (2015) Video games around the world, , Wolf M.J.P., Iwatani T., (eds), Cambridge, England, MIT Press, (Eds; (2012) Film, television and digital games 2011–12, , https://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/DetailsPage/8679.02011-12, Canberra, Author, Retrieved from; (2017) Film, television and digital games, Australia, 2015–16, , https://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/mf/8679.0, Canberra, Author, Retrieved from; Banks, J., (2013) Co-creating videogames, , New York, NY, Bloomsbury; Banks, J., Cunningham, S., Creative destruction in the Australian videogames industry (2016) Media International Australia, 160, pp. 127-139; Banks, M., (2007) The politics of cultural work, , New York, NY, Palgrave Macmillan; Bourdieu, P., The production of belief: Contribution to an economy of symbolic goods (1980) Media, Culture and Society, 2, pp. 261-293; Bourdieu, P., The field of cultural production, or: The economic world reversed (1983) Poetics, 12, pp. 311-356; Bourdieu, P., (1984) Distinction: A social critique of the judgement of taste, , Cambridge, England, Harvard University Press; Crogan, P., Indie dreams: Video games, creative economy, and the hyperindustrial epoch (2018) Games and Culture, 13, pp. 671-689; Cunningham, S., Creative labour and its discontents: A reapparaisal (2014) Creative work beyond the creative industries: Innovation, employment and education, pp. 25-46. , Greg H., Bridgstock R., Goldsmith B., Rodgers J., (eds), Cheltenham, England, Edward Elgar, (Eds.), (., –; de Peuter, G., Cohen, N.S., Saraco, F., The ambivalence of coworking: On the politics of an emerging work practice (2017) European Journal of Cultural Studies, 20, pp. 687-706; de Peuter, G., Dyer-Witheford, N., A playful multitude?

The large growth of this market has led to similarly large growth in the gambling industry around esports, with some estimates predicting over US$7.4 billion in wagers made in 2018. In this article, we explain the nuances of the esports gambling market that differentiate it from the traditional sports betting market, such as “skins” betting, and empirically examine the biases present in wagering for two different esport titles (Counter-Strike: Global Offensive and Dota 2) at two esports gambling websites. We find that real money and skins gambling markets have different types of market biases. In particular, we find that bettors in real money markets tend to overbet large underdogs, particularly when those underdogs are European teams playing against non-European teams. © The Author(s) 2019.","econometrics; economics; esports; gambling markets; market bias",,,,,,,,,"Adamus, T., Playing computer games as electronic sport: In search of a theoretical framework for a new research field (2012) Computer games and new media cultures: A handbook of digital games studies, pp. 477-490. , Fromme J., Unger A., (eds), Dordrecht, the Netherlands, Springer, (Eds.), (., –; The HGC is leveling up in 2018 (2018) Blizzard Entertainment, , https://esports.heroesofthestorm.com/en-us/news/21120547/the-hgc-is-leveling-up-in-2018, Retrieved from; Brock, T., Roger Caillois and e-sports: On the problems of treating play as work (2017) Games and Culture, 12, pp. 321-339; Cleghorn, J., Griffiths, M.D., Why do gamers buy ‘virtual assets’?

Critiquing existing histories of games for often neglecting players and the specific locales in which games are played, it draws on both new cinema history and cultural studies’ conception of “radical contextualism” to outline what the article describes as a game’s ludosity. Ludosity, the article proposes, is the condition or quality of game partcipation as shaped by a range of agents, institutions, and contexts. Utilizing mass observation records, it offers a detailed analysis of the ways in which social interactions influenced ludic experiences of pinball tables and crane machines and posits that games history needs to center players in order to fully conceptualize games in history. © The Author(s) 2019.","arcades; cultural studies; games history; pinball; social history",,,,,,,,,"Apperley, T., Parikka, J., Platform studies’ epistemic threshold (2015) Games and Culture, 13, pp. 349-369; Bateman, C., Implicit game aesthetics (2015) Games and Culture, 10, pp. 389-411; Benson, J., (1983) The penny capitalists: A study of nineteenth-century working-class entrepreneurs, , Dublin, Ireland, Gill and MacMillan; Bogost, I., Montfort, N., Platform studies: Frequently questioned answers (2009) Digital Arts and Culture, , http://escholarship.org/uc/item/01r0k9br.pdf, Retrieved from; Burke, P., (2008) What is cultural history?, , London, England, Polity; Brooker, W., Jermyn, D., (2003) The audience studies reader, , London, England, Routledge, (Eds; Bruton, E.M., (2012) Beyond Marconi: The roles of the admiralty, the post office, and the institution of electrical engineers in the invention and development of wireless communication up to 1908, , Unpublished PhD thesis, University of Leeds, UK; Collins, K., Game sound in the mechanical arcades: An audio archaeology (2016) Game Studies, 16. , http://gamestudies.org/1601/articles/collins, Retrieved from; Consalvo, M., There is no magic circle (2009) Games and Culture, 4, pp. 408-417; Crawford, G., (2011) Video gamers, , London, England, Routledge; Crofton, J., Two thousand million pennies a year on pin-tables (1939) Daily Mail, p. 10. , (, March 2)., p; Deterding, S., Alibis for adult play: A Goffmanian account of escaping embarrassment in adult play (2018) Games and Culture, 13, pp. 260-279; Downs, C., Two fat ladies at the seaside: Gambling in working class holidays 1920–1970 (2011) Recording Leisure Lives: Holidays and Tourism in 20th Century Britain, pp. 51-73. , Snape R., Smith D., (eds), Colchester, Leisure Studies Association, (Eds.), (., –; Ernst, W., Media archaeography: Method and machine versus history and narrative of media (2011) Media archaeology. approaches, applications, and implications, pp. 239-255. , Huhtamo E., Parikka J., (eds), Berkeley, University of California Press, (Eds.), (., –; (1942) Daily Mail, , Friday, April 10, p. 3; Gazzard, A., The intertextual arcade: Tracing histories of arcade clones in 1980s Britain (2014) Reconstruction, 14, p. 3; Gazzard, A., Between pixels and play: The role of the photograph in videogame nostalgias (2016) Photography and Culture, 9, pp. 151-162; Giddings, S., Events and collusions: A glossary for the microethnography of video game play (2009) Games and Culture, 4, pp. 144-157; Gitelman, L., (2006) Always already new: Media, history, and the data of culture, , Cambridge, MA, MIT Press; Goffman, E., (1974) Frame analysis: An essay on the organization of experience, , Cambridge, MA, Harvard University Press; Guins, R., Intruder alert! intruder alert!” Video games in space (2004) Journal of Visual Culture, 3, pp. 195-211; Guins, R., (2014) Game after: A cultural study of video game afterlife, , Cambridge, MIT Press; Grossberg, L., (1997) Bringing it all back home: Essays on cultural studies, , Durham, NC, Duke University Press; Hall, S., Cultural studies: Two paradigms (1980) Media, Culture & Society, 2, pp. 57-72; Harper, T., (2013) The culture of digital fighting games: Performance and practice, , London, England, Routledge; Harris, N., (1981) Humbug: The art of P.T.

The destruction enacted by these antagonists is not entirely negative; rather, it is a part of the cycle of rebirth that is necessary for the renewal of Hyrule both within the series mythology and in the context of the player’s delight in the postapocalyptic and preindustrial green spaces that characterize the games in the Zelda franchise. A close reading of the original Japanese-language script of Breath of the Wild (2017), Skyward Sword (2011), and The Wind Waker (2002) reveals that the various permutations of Ganon add cultural depth to the games, thus endowing the conflicts underlying their stories with a greater sense of literary complexity. © The Author(s) 2019.","Buddhism;

In the male-dominated sphere of esports, the underrepresentation of women and nonbinary people often leaves these marginalized groups invisible, with a significant lack of women and nonbinary people competing in top-tier tournaments. We highlight the experience of Wang ‘BaiZe’ Xinyu, a Chinese Hearthstone player who became the first woman to compete in a Hearthstone Championship Tour event in the game’s 3-year history. The narrative surrounding BaiZe’s participation largely focused on her gender and ignored the achievements that led her to qualify for the event. We argue that BaiZe’s entrance to the championship scene was received negatively by both competitors and spectators, reinforcing barriers that exclude women and nonbinary people from entering this male-dominated space. The discrimination faced by these esports competitors reinforces sexism inherent not only in Hearthstone but also in esports in general. © The Author(s) 2019.","competitive gaming; esports; gender; gender in games; Hearthstone",,,,,,,,,"(2016), http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-37992322, November, 22, Retrieved from; Anable, A., Casual games, time management, and the work of affect (2013) Ada: A Journal of Gender, New Media, and Technology, , Advance online publication; (2019) Hearthstone grandmasters is almost here!

The term has roots in the religious tradition of the Indian subcontinent and was subsequently imported into video game terminology during a period of widespread appropriation of Eastern culture by Californian tech industries. We argue that the use of the term was not a case of happenstance but a signaling of the potential for computing to offer a mystical or enchanted perspective within an otherwise secular world. This suggests that the concept is useful in game cultures precisely because it plays with the “otherness” of the term's original meaning. We argue that this indicates a fundamental hybridity to gaming cultures that highlight the need to add postcolonial perspectives to how issues of diversity and power in gaming cultures are understood. © The Author(s) 2019.","avatar; cultural appropriation; diversity; game culture; postcolonialism",,,,,,,,,"Aarseth, E., Genre trouble: Narrativism and the art of simulation (2004) First person: New media as story, performance, and game, pp. 45-55. , Wardrip-Fruin N., Harrigan P., (eds), Cambridge, England, MIT Press, (Eds.), (., –; Aldred, J., A question of character: Transmediation, abstraction and identification in early games licensed from movies (2012) Before the crash: Early video game history, pp. 90-104. , Wolf M.J.P., (ed), Detroit, MI, Wayne State University Press, (Ed.), (., –; Aupers, S., The Force is Great”: Enchantment and magic in Silicon Valley (2009) Masaryk University Journal of Law and Technology, 3, pp. 153-173; Aupers, S., Where the zeroes meet the ones’: Exploring the affinity between magic and computer technology (2010) Religions of modernity: Relocating the sacred to the self and the digital, pp. 219-238. , Aupers S., Houtman D., (eds), Boston, MA, Brill, ‘, (Eds.), (., –; Barbrook, R., Cameron, A., The Californian ideology (1996) Science as Culture, 6, pp. 44-72; Basu Thakur, G.B., (2015) Postcolonial theory and avatar, , London, England, Bloomsbury; Bayley, C.A., India, the Bhagavad Gita and the world (2010) Modern Intellectual History, 7, pp. 275-295; Bogost, I., Montfort, N., (2009) Racing the beam: The Atari video computer system, , Cambridge, England, MIT Press; Bosman, F.G., The incarnated gamer (2017) Boundaries of self and reality online: Implications of digitally constructed realities, pp. 187-203. , Gackenbach J., Brown J., (eds), London, England, Elsevier, (Eds.), (., –; Boudreau, K., (2012) Between play and design: The emergence of hybrid-identity in single-player videogames, , PhD dissertation, Montréal, Canada, Université de Montréal; Britt, A., Avatar (2008) The New York Times, , http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/10/magazine/10wwln-guest-t.html, August, 8, Retrieved from; Bruce, S., (2002) God is dead: Secularisation in the west, , Oxford, England, Blackwell; Coleman, B., (2011) Hello avatar: The rise of the networked generation, , Cambridge, England, MIT Press; Consalvo, M., Console video games and global corporations: Creating a hybrid culture (2006) New Media & Society, 8, pp. 117-137; Consalvo, M., Begy, J., (2015) Players and their pets: Gaming communities from beta to sunset, , Minneapolis, University of Minnesota Press; Couture, A., From Visnu’s deeds to Visnu’s play, or observations on the word Avatāra as a designation for the manifestations of Visnu (2001) Journal of Indian Philosophy, 29, pp. 313-326; Davie, G., Believing without belonging: Is this the future of religion in Britain?

A key strategy in this discourse is the sharing of content via links on Twitter, which accompany messages positioning the sender on either side of the debate. Through qualitative analysis of a data set drawn from 1,311 tweets from 2016 to 2017, we argue that tweeted links are a salient tool for signaling affiliation with gaming communities. For anti-feminist gamers, the tweeted link defines masculinist gamer identity and constructs social boundaries against the increasing diversification of video game culture reflected in higher overall rates of feminist tweets. Links can be construed as revelatory of boundary work and thus can help shed insight on the extent to which #GamerGate discourse was intended to defend gaming culture as an exclusively masculine space. © The Author(s) 2019.","#GamerGate; game studies; gamers; gender; links; social identity; Twitter",,,,,,,,,"Anthropy, A., (2012) Rise of the video game zinesters, , New York, NY, Seven Stories Press; Baio, A., 72 Hours of #Gamergate (2014) Medium, , https://medium.com/message/72-hours-of-gamergate-e00513f7cf5d, October, 27, Retrieved from; Bellmore, A., Calvin, A.J., Xu, J.M., Zhu, X., The five w’s of “bullying” on Twitter: Who, what, why, where, and when (2015) Computers in Human Behavior, 44, pp. 305-314; Boluk, S., LeMieux, P., (2017) Metagaming: Playing, competing, spectating, cheating, trading, making, and breaking video games, , Minneapolis, University of Minnesota Press; Braithwaite, A., It’s about ethics in games journalism?

However, very little work in Game Studies examines how critical games journalism, games, developers, and independent actors intersect. This article argues that pragmatic sociology of critique, developed by Luc Boltanski, can act as a theoretical framework to aid in understanding these processes of critique. Utilizing a theoretical lens such as this helps us better understand the function of games critique within the video game industry. Applying this framework to a case study of monetization and “loot boxes,” this article emphasizes the role and power of journalistic critique in shaping gaming cultures, and the consumption and production of media more generally. © The Author(s) 2019.","economic platform studies;

Entertainment Merchants Association adjudicated the State of California’s right to regulate the sale of “violent” video games and, in the process, effectively considered how video games should be apprehended as a cultural form under the law. The court’s decision cited the missteps of judicial film censorship in protecting video games as a form of expression under the First Amendment, placing video games into a cultural time line of expressive forms. Some media scholars contest the court’s approach for overvaluing the cultural aspects of video games and neglecting their distinct digital materiality. However, a close reading of the case and the circumstances that led the justices’ opinions helps articulate a crucial critique of overly materialist approaches to video games associated with media archaeology. The case details reflect the inextricability of materiality and experience in considering video games as a form of expression. © The Author(s) 2019.","censorship; digital materiality; film history; interaction; media archaeology; medium specificity; U.S. Supreme Court; video games",,,,,,,,,"Aaron, M., (2007) Spectatorship: The power of looking on, , London, England, Wallflower; Aarseth, E.J., (1997) Cybertext: Perspectives on Ergodic literature, , Baltimore, MD, Johns Hopkins University Press; American Amusement Machine Ass’n v.

For much of the series, his rage drives much of the narrative and game dynamics, as Kratos destroys the entire Greek pantheon. The latest iteration of the series moves Kratos into Norse mythology and introduces a son. This father–son relationship allows the developers to ruminate upon the toxic masculinity that has defined much of the series’ past. Kratos’ trajectory moves from the flatness of one defining characteristic, rage, to an introspective consideration of this emotion and its consequences. A parabolic supporting cast set the stage, each illustrating an aspect of toxicity; as explored, the mother–son relationship between Freya and her son, Baldur, is given a poignant twist. Overall, this article investigates how God of War articulates characteristics of toxic masculinity, explores its repercussions, and offers lessons for its rehabilitation. © The Author(s) 2019.","digital games; God of War; Kratos; masculinity; mythology",,,,,,,,,"Adler, M.J., (1997) Aristotle for everybody: Difficult thought made easy, , New York, NY, Touchstone; Althusser, L., (2001) Lenin and philosophy and other essays, , New York, NY, Monthly Review Press; Butler, J., (1993) Bodies that matter: On the discursive limits of “Sex, , London, England, Routledge; Butler, J., (2011) Gender trouble: Feminism and the subversion of identity, , 2nd ed, London, England, Routledge; Chess, S., Shaw, A., A conspiracy of fishes, or, how we learned to stop worrying about #gamergate and embrace hegemonic masculinity (2015) Journal of Broadcasting and Electronic Media, 59; Chu, J.Y., (2014) When boys become boys: Development, relationships, and masculinity, , New York, New York University Press; Connell, R.W., (1987) Gender and power, , Sydney, Australia, Allen & Unwin; Connell, R.W., (2005) Masculinities: Knowledge, power and social change, , 2nd ed, Cambridge, England, Polity; Connell, R.W., Messerschmidt, W., Hegemonic masculinity: Rethinking the concept (2005) Gender and Society, 19, pp. 829-859; Conway, S., Hyper-ludicity, contra-ludicity and the digital game (2010) Eludamos: Journal for Computer Game Culture, 4. , http://www.eludamos.org/index.php/eludamos/article/view/vol4no2-2, online, Retrieved March 21, 2012, from; Curtis, N., Cardo, V., Superheroes and third-wave feminism (2018) Feminist Media Studies, 18, pp. 381-396; de Beauvoir, S., (2011) The second sex, , Borde C., Malovany-Chevallier S., (eds), New York, NY, Vintage Books, (, Eds; Dreher, J., Alfred Schutz (2011) The Wiley-Blackwell companion to major social theorists, pp. 489-510. , Ritzer G., Stepnisky J., (eds), London, England, Blackwell, (Eds.), (., –; Emig, R., Rowland, A., Introduction (2010) Performing masculinity, pp. 1-12. , Emig R., Rowland A., (eds), London, England, Palgrave MacMillan, (Eds.), (., –; (2017) [MacOS].

We begin by describing how gamification “traveled” as an idea, evolving from controversial yet persuasive buzzword to legitimate policy priority. We then focus on how gamification was represented in Horizon 2020: the flagship European Research & Development program from 2014 to 2020, worth nearly €80 billion of funding. The article argues that the ethically problematic aspects of gamification were removed through a process of policy capture that involved its assimilation in an established European network of research and small and medium enterprise (SME) actors. This process of “ethical neutering” is also observable in the actual funding calls, where the problematic assumptions of gamification around agency and manipulation are made invisible through a superficial commitment to vague and ill-defined criteria of responsible research and innovation. © The Author(s) 2019.","discourse analysis; ethics; gamification; gaming; Horizon 2020; mobilities; policy analysis; responsible research and innovation",,,,,,,,,"Appadurai, A., (1996) Modernity at large: Cultural dimensions of globalization, 1. , Minneapolis, University of Minnesota Press; Ball, S.J., Following policy: Networks, network ethnography and education policy mobilities (2016) Journal of Education Policy, 31, pp. 549-566; Ball, S.J., Junemann, C., Santori, D., (2017) Edu. net: Globalisation and education policy mobility, , New York, NY, Routledge; Bateman, C., Playing work, or gamification as stultification (2018) Information, Communication & Society, 21, pp. 1193-1203; Bazeley, P., Jackson, K., (2013) Qualitative data analysis with NVivo, , London, England, Sage, (Eds; Berleur, J., Galand, J.M., ICT policies of the European Union: From an information society to Europe.

Using Mitchell’s conception of defamiliarizing poetic gameplay, this study identifies poetic gameplay devices, which creatively alter the feedback loop for emotional narrative impact. The article suggests extending the term “poetic gameplay” beyond interactive devices whose primary goal is critical appreciation of aesthetic form, to techniques directed at deepening a player’s narrative involvement, via alterations to interactivity designed to evoke emotions that mirror a protagonist’s experience. Close readings of 19 interactive life stories identified 13 devices, which fall into two categories: alterations to manipulation rules (involving local agency) and alterations to goal rules (involving higher level agency). The findings reveal some of the expressive possibilities of interactivity in digital narrative. © The Author(s) 2019.","agency; interactive feedback loop; interactivity; life stories; poetic gameplay",,,,,,,,,"Anable, A., (2018) Playing with feelings: Video games and affect, , Minneapolis, University of Minnesota Press; Anthropy, A., (2012) Dys4ia, , https://jayisgames.com/games/dys4ia/, [Computer game], Retrieved February 28, 2016, from; Antonisse, J., Johnson, D., (2007) Hush, , [Computer game]; Arsenault, D., Perron, B., In the frame of the magic cycle: The circle(s) of gameplay (2009) The video game theory reader 2, pp. 109-131. , Perron B., Wolf M.J.P., (eds), London, England, Routledge, (Eds.), (., –; Bardzell, J., (2008) Interaction criticism: How to do it [Blog post], , https://interactionculture.wordpress.com/2008/06/04/interactioncriticism-how-to-do-it-part-1/, June, 4, Retrieved from; Bardzell, J., Interaction criticism: An introduction to the practice (2011) Interacting with Computers, 23, pp. 604-621; Bizzocchi, J., Tanenbaum, J., Well read: Applying close reading techniques to gameplay experiences (2011) Well played 3.0, , http://press.etc.cmu.edu/content/well-played-30-video-games-value-andmeaning, Davidson D., (ed), Pittsburg, CA, ETC Press, Retrieved from, (Ed; Bogost, I., (2007) Persuasive games, , Cambridge, MIT Press; Bopp, J.A., Mekler, E.D., Opwis, K., (2016) Proceedings of the 2016 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems, pp. 2996-3006. , New York, NY, ACM, (., –; Brecht, B., (1957) Schriften zum Theater: Über eine nicht-aristotelische Dramatik (Writings on Theatre: On a Non-Aristotelian Drama), , Frankfurt, Germany, Suhrkamp Verlag; Brice, M., (2011) Ludonarrative resonance.

Subsequent authors have offered their own rationalizations and expanded upon his game categories but have not explained Caillois’s approach. This essay performs a close reading of Man, Play and Games in order to evince his methodology. I argue that Caillois holds to the idea that play reproduces uncertainty in a safe and confined way but that a paradox troubles this vision and pushes him into a baroque formalism. Instead of a simple relation between model and copy, Caillois develops another, stranger concept of mimesis that continues and extends his Surrealist writing about insects and the unconscious. My reading builds on previous analyses of Caillois within game studies, sociology, and media theory to revise the methodological presuppositions built into the categorization of games. © The Author(s) 2019.","form; mimesis; Roger Caillois; self-reflexivity; structuralism",,,,,,,,,"Atkinson, M., Fell running and voluptuous panic (2011) American Journal of Play, 4, pp. 100-120; Bataille, G., The notion of expenditure (1985) Visions of excess: Selected writings, pp. 116-129. , Stoekl A., Leslie D., Lovitt C., Stoekl A., (eds), Minneapolis, University of Minnesota Press, (Ed.), (Trans.), (., –; Bateson, G., A theory of play and fantasy (1972) Steps to an ecology of mind, pp. 183-198. , Engle M., (ed), Northvale, NJ, Jason Aronson, (Ed.), (., –; Benveniste, É., Le jeu comme structure [The Game as a Structure] (1947) Deucalion, 2, pp. 161-167; Biesty, P., Caillois revisited: A developmental classification of games (1987) Meaningful play, Playful meaning, pp. 3-16. , Fine G.A., (ed), Champaign, IL, Human Kinetics, (Ed.), (., –; Bohman-Kalaja, K., (2007) Reading games, , Champaign, IL, Dalkey Archive Press; Brock, T., Roger Caillois and E-sports: On the problems of treating play as work (2017) Games and Culture, 12, pp. 321-339; Caillois, R., J.

Using the “hag” in Dungeons & Dragons as a case study, the authors demonstrate how the game’s bestiary, the Monster Manual, functions as a tool of patriarchal control by defining, categorizing, and classifying the body of the female other as evil, abject, and monstrous. Importantly, the ludic bestiary not only exists as a core rulebook in Dungeons & Dragons but has also been remediated as a narrative-heavy submenu in several digital games. The authors find that the figure of the monstrous woman persists in games because of the widespread distribution of the Monster Manual to young men in hobby communities, the cultural influence of Dungeons & Dragons, depictions of monstrosity that blend the erotic with the maternal, and the discursive categorization and objectification of the female body by ludic systems. © The Author(s) 2019.","abject; bestiary; Dungeons & Dragons; gender; Monster Manual",,,,,,,,,"Adinolfi, F., (2008) Mondo exotica: Sounds, visions, obsessions of the cocktail generation, , Pinkus K., (ed), Durham, NC, Duke University Press, (, Trans; Alexander, L., ‘Gamers’ don’t have to be your audience. ‘Gamers’ are over (2014) Gamasutra, , https://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/224400/Gamers_dont_have_to_be_your_audience:Gamers_are_over.php, August, 28, Retrieved from; Anonymous, Print run estimates Aceaum, , https://www.acaeum.com/library/printrun.html, Retrieved from; Blume, B., TSR—Why we do what we do (1975) The Strategic Review, 1, p. 1; Bowker, G., Star, S.L., (2000) Sorting things out: Classification and its consequences, , Cambridge, The MIT Press; Caputi, J., (2004) Goddesses and monsters: Women, myth, power, and popular culture, , Madison, University of Wisconsin Press; Clements, P.J., (2015) Roll to save vs. prejudice: The phenomenology of race in Dungeons & Dragons, , http://rave.ohiolink.edu/etdc/view?acc_num=bgsu1448050814, Master’s thesis).

The method develops a comparative approach to how video games structure temporal experience, yielding an efficient set of terms—“diachrony,” “synchrony,” and “unstable signifier”—through which to analyze gaming’s “heterochronia” or temporal complexity. This method also yields an approach to the contentious topic of video game narrative which may particularly recommend it to literary scholars with an interest in the form. Along with some examples from conventional games, a close reading of the “reality-inspired” game Bury Me, My Love will serve to demonstrate the use of a chronotypological approach. © The Author(s) 2019.","narrative; reality-inspired games; temporality; video games",,,,,,,,,"Aarseth, E., Genre trouble: Narrativism and the art of simulation (2004) First person: New media as story, performance and game, , Wardrip-Fruin N., Harrigan P., (eds), Cambridge, The MIT Press, (Eds; Aarseth, E., A Narrative Theory of Games (2012) Foundations of Digital Games Conference Proceedings, pp. 129-133; Aarseth, E.J., (1997) Cybertext: Perspectives on ergodic literature, , Baltimore, MD, The Johns Hopkins University Press; Agamben, G., (1993) Infancy and history: Essays on the destruction of experience, , London, England: Verso; Apperley, T., (2010) Global rhythms: Play and counterplay from the situated to the global, , Amsterdam, the Netherlands, Institute of Network Cultures; Apperley, T., Jayemanne, D., Game Studies' Material Turn (2012) Westminster Papers in Communication and Culture, 9 (1), pp. 5-25; Jayemanne, D., (2017) Peformativity in art, literature and videogames, , Basingstoke, England, Palgrave Macmillan; Bissell, M., Burns, M., (2015) The writer will do something, , https://mrwasteland.itch.io/twwds, Retrieved February 5, 2019, from; Boluk, S., LeMieux, P., (2017) Metagaming: Playing, competing, spectating, cheating, trading, making, and breaking videogames, , Minneapolis, University of Minnesota Press; (2019) Resident Evil 2, , [Videogame], Osaka, Japan, Capcom; Consalvo, M., (2009) Cheating: Gaining Advantage in Videogames, , Cambridge, MA, The MIT Press; Dena, C., Finding a Way: Techniques to Avoid Schema Tension in Narrative Design (2017) Transactions of the Digital Games Research Association, 3 (1); Despain, W., (2008) Professional techniques for video game writing, , Wellesley, MA, A K Peters, (Ed; Dominguez, C., Saussy, H., Villanueva, D., (2015) Introducing comparative literature, , New York, NY, Routledge; (2015) Life is Strange; Dovey, J., Kennedy, H., (2006) Game cultures: Computer games as new media, , Berkshire, England, Open University Press; Ensslin, A., (2014) Literary Gaming, , Cambridge, MA, The MIT Press; (2018) Fortnite, , Videogame, Cary, NA, Epic Games, [,]; Ford, M., (2016) Writing interactive fiction with twine: Play inside a story, , Indianapolis, IA, Que; Frank, A., Gaming the game: A study of the gamer mode in educational wargaming (2011) Simulation & Gaming, 43, pp. 118-132; Frasca, G., Simulation versus narrative: Introduction to ludology (2003) The video game theory reader, , Wolf M.J.P., Perron B., (eds), London, England, Routledge, (Eds; (2013) Gone Home, , Videogame, Portland, OR, The Fullbright Company, [,]; Heussner, T., Finley, T., Hepler, J., Lemay, A., (2015) The game narrative toolbox, , Bington, MA, Focal Press; Jauss, H.R., Benzinger, E., Literary history as a challenge to literary theory (1970) New Literary History, 2, pp. 7-37; Jenkins, H., (2006) Convergence Culture: Where Old and New Media Collide, , New York, NYU Press; Keogh, B., (2018) A play of bodies: How we perceive videogames, , Cambridge, The MIT Press; Koenitz, H., What game narrative are we talking about?

I argue that statistical, self-tracking utilities in videogames shape how gameplay “appears” and how it is experienced and valued by users. I proceed by situating contemporary self-tracking in games as part of a broader history of play as “quantified.” From there, drawing on interdisciplinary studies of self-tracking, as well as Bernard Stiegler’s postphenomenological analyses of technology, I characterize quantified play in three main ways. First, it is voluntary and occupied with self-knowledge. Second, it is used in mundane or everyday contexts. Third, it relates to the habitual faculty of users. The remainder of the essay illustrates the concept of quantified play through two examples of tracking hardware and software—showing how numerical or statistical apprehensions of player activity (and visualizations thereof) shape how we negotiate videogames. © The Author(s) 2019.","data analytics;

Beyond this similarity to literary works, some video games deploy various design strategies that blend gameplay and literary elements to explicitly foreground a hybrid literary/ludic experience. We identify three such strategies: engaging with literary structures, forms, and techniques; deploying text in an aesthetic rather than a functional way; and intertextuality. This article aims to analyze how these design strategies are deployed in What Remains of Edith Finch to support a hybrid readerly/playerly experience. We argue that this type of design is particularly suited for walking simulators (or walking sims) because they support interpretive play through slowness, ambiguity, narrative, and aesthetic aspirations. Understanding walking sims as literary games can shift the emphasis from their lack of “traditional” gameplay complexity and focus instead on the opportunities that they afford for hybrid storytelling and for weaving literature and gameplay in innovative and playful ways. © The Author(s) 2019.","art games; literary gaming; narrative games; reading games; walking simulators; What Remains of Edith Finch",,,,,,,,,"Anthropy, A., (2012) Rise of the videogame zinesters: How freaks, normals, amateurs, artists, dreamers, dropouts, queers, housewives, and people like you are taking back an art form, , New York, NY, Seven Stories Press; Bizzocchi, J., Tanenbaum, J., Well read: Applying close reading techniques to gameplay experiences (2011) Well Played 3.0, , Davidson D., (ed), Pittsburgh, PA, ETC Press, (Ed; Calleja, G., (2011) In-game from immersion to incorporation, , Cambridge, MA, MIT Press; Carbo-Mascarell, R., Walking simulators: The digitisation of an aesthetic practice (2016) DiGRA/FDG ‘16—Proceedings of the First International Joint Conference of DiGRA and FDG, 1. , http://www.digra.org/digital-library/publications/walking-simulators-the-digitisation-of-an-aesthetic-practice/, Dundee, August, Retrieved November 14, 2018, from, 2018, In; Carpenter, J., Hill, D., (1978) Halloween, , [Live action film].

Here, we form conceptual linkages between literature on gaming and gender, prison and gender, and two prior studies on prison-themed video games. Although we draw on past research, the primary intent of this inquiry is to serve as a review of the extant literature as it relates to an emerging area of research (i.e., gender- and prison-themed video games). We consider why such portrayals are important to the current discourse regarding gender in games, and in what ways inclusion in this conversation could create more comprehensive and critical outcomes in the future direction of game development, as well as the possibility for games to engage the public regarding traditionally gendered institutions. © The Author(s) 2019.","gender; prison; prison games; prison media; video games",,,,,,,,,"Baerg, A., Governmentality, neoliberalism, and the digital game (2009) Symploke, 17, pp. 115-127; Bartlett, A., Hollins, S., Challenges and mental health needs of women in prison (2018) The British Journal of Psychiatry, 212, pp. 134-136; Brenick, A., Henning, A., Killen, M., O’Connor, A., Collins, M., Social evaluations of stereotypic images in video games (2007) Youth & Society, 38, pp. 395-419; Brown, M., (2009) The culture of punishment: Prison, society, and spectacle, , New York, New York University Press; Bryce, J., Rutter, J., (2002) Killing like a girl: Gendered gaming and girl gamers’ visibility, , Proceedings of the Computer Games and Digital Cultures Conference, June 6–8, Tampere, Finland; Bryce, J., Rutter, J., (2006) Understanding digital games, , New York, NY, Sage; Burgess, M.C.R., Stermer, S.P., Burgess, S.R., Sex, lies and video games: The portrayal of male and female characters on video game covers (2007) Sex Roles, 57, pp. 419-433; Carson, E.A., (2018) Prisoners in 2016, , [NCJ 251149], Washington, DC, Bureau of Justice Statistics, U.S. Department of Justice; Cassar, R., Gramsci and games (2013) Games and Culture, 8, pp. 330-353; Cecil, D., (2015) Prison life in popular culture: From The Big House to Orange Is the New Black, , (1st ed.), Boulder, CO, Lynne Rienner; Chess, S., Evans, N.J., Baines, J.J., What does a gamer look like?

This study explores what children have experienced they have learned by playing digital games, how these learning experiences relate to 21st-century skills, and in which contexts do the children benefit from playing digital games. The data were collected from children’s essays, which were analyzed using qualitative content analysis. Results reveal that children’s learning experiences are often related to 21st-century core subjects and skills, but they also reported improved physical abilities and sports competences from digital games. Children felt that the skills they had gained were beneficial in the contexts of school, sports, and friendships. The results contribute to our understanding of digital games and children by providing children’s perspective on digital games and learning. © The Author(s) 2019.","21st-century skills; digital games;

However, these seemingly self-evident explanations do not hold up under scrutiny. In this article, I posit that the omission of children’s texts and ludic texts from well-developed scholarly contexts is partly rooted in the ideological collocation of “children,” “play,” and “low culture.” I compare the strategies used by children’s literature studies and games studies to manage their marginalization and conclude that irrespective of the quality, the variety, the relevance, and the impact of research conducted within these two disciplines, neither will find a permanent home in the serious, sophisticated, “adults-only” space of the literature faculty. I ask whether this is necessarily a problem, and suggest that - when consciously embraced - the lightness of illegitimacy may be a potent as the heft of tradition. Finally, I advocate for an intersectional alliance between children's literature studies and games studies and explore some of the ways in which this kind of academic solidarity might counter the marginalizing effects of infantilization. © The Author(s) 2019.","children’s literature studies; infantilization; interdisciplinary; meta-analysis; panmediality; YA literature",,,,,,,,,"Aarseth, E., Meta-game studies (2015) Game Studies, 15, pp. 1-2; Al-Yaqout, G., Nikolajeva, M., Re-conceptualising picturebook theory in the digital age (2015) Nordic Journal of ChildLit Aesthetics, 6; Anthropy, A., (2012) Rise of the videogame Zinesters: How freaks, normals, amateurs, artists, dreamers, dropouts, queers, housewives, and people like you are taking back an artform, , New York, NY, Seven Stories Press; (2010) Alice fo the iPad, , California, Oceanhouse Media; Attebery, B., (2014) Stories about stories: Fantasy and the remaking of myth, , Oxford, England, Oxford University Press; Backe, H., The literary canon in the age of new media (2015) Poetics Today, 36, pp. 1-31; Baudrillard, J., (1981) Simulacra and Simulation, , Sheila Glaser, (ed), Michigan, United States of America, University of Michigan, (trans; Bloom, H., Can 35 million book buyers be wrong?

However, there was another country where women did also design games decades before the #GamerGate movement. This article examines the selected works of three French designers: Clotilde Marion, Chine Lanzmann, and Muriel Tramis. The analysis of those games took into account the self-representation of those designers—and women in general—within the game content. The conducted research has proven that within their games, Marion, Lanzmann, and Tramis included their everyday experiences as women. Using such techniques as simulated point of view and authorial signature, those women indicated their own role in the development and showed how females in general face male oppression against them. This means that the United States is not the only country with a long tradition of female game developers. Thus, video game history remains an undiscovered research field. © The Author(s) 2019.","female designers; feminine games; french video games; postcolonial games; video games",,,,,,,,,"Benes, L., Berchiatti, D., (1984) Le Mystère de Kikekankoi [The Mystery of Kikekankoi] [Amstrad CPC], , France, Loriciels; Benes, L., Berchiatti, D., (1985) Orphée, , [Amstrad CPC], France, Loriciels; Bhabha, H., (1994) The location of culture, , New York, NY, Routledge; Blanchet, A., France (2016) Video games around the world, pp. 175-192. , Wolf M.J.P., (ed), Cambridge, MIT Press, (Ed.), (., –; Bonnell, B., (1986) Les Passagers du vent, , [Amstrad CPC], France, Infogrames; Carr, D., Playing with Lara (2002) Screenplay: Cinema/videogames/interfaces, pp. 171-180. , King G., Krzywinska T., (eds), New York, NY, Wallflower Press, (Eds.), (., –; Cazenave, T., Desportes, L., (1986) La Java du privé, , [Ale II], France, Froggy Software; Cobbett, R., (2011) Saturday crapshoot: Fascination, , https://www.pcgamer.com/saturday-crapshoot-fascination/, Retrieved from; de Beauvoir, S., (1956) The second sex, , Parshley H.M., (ed), London, England, Jonathan Cape, (, Trans; Deconchat, J., Méwilo (1988) Science & Vie Micro, 46, p. 131; Desmedt, P., La femme qui ne supportait pas les ordinateurs [The Woman Who Hated Computers] (1986) Tilt, 31, pp. 128-129; Donovan, T., (2010) Replay: The history of video games, , Lewes, England, Yellow Ant; Dovey, J., Kennedy, H., (2006) Game cultures: Computer games as new media.

Gone Home is widely seen as exemplifying a current shift toward increased LGBTQ (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer) representation in video games. The game is also associated with queerness through its status as a “walking simulator,” a genre with ties to the queer flaneur. Indeed, Gone Home’s gameplay seems to encourage queer wandering, moving not straight but instead meanderingly. Yet, a closer analysis of its interactive elements reveals that Gone Home is far less queer than it may initially appear. The player’s path is rigid and linear, much like in a “rail shooter.” The potential for queer movement in Gone Home has been furthered straightened by speedrunners who play the game along the straightest possible paths.

The aim is to provide an understanding of gameplay outlining the inherent complexities and convoluted layers of play and game which exist in the playing of a game. The theory is inspired by phenomenology and Martin Heidegger’s concept of Dasein. We do not intent to resolve the paradox that games are both objects and activities. Instead, we offer an analytical and methodological guide to the ontology of gameplay resting on an oscillating relationship between a double-layered structure of “here” and “there” in playing and gaming. © The Author(s) 2019.","analysis; computer game; gameplay; phenomenology; play; theory",,,,,,,,,"Aarseth, E., Allegories of space—The question of space in computer games (2000) Cybertext yearbook, , Eskelinen M., Koskimaa R., (eds), Saarijärvi, Finland, Gummerus Printing, (Eds; Aarseth, E., (2003) Playing research: Methodological approaches to game analysis, , Proceedings of the Digital Arts and Culture Conference, Melbourne, Australia; Aarseth, E., Calleja, G., (2015) The word game: The ontology of an undefinable object, , Proceedings of the 10th International Conference on the Foundations of Digital Games (FDG 2015).

Nevertheless, the limitation of the game system order implies that, as a fundamental part of this epistemological approach, the empirical validity of its methodology is already being rejected. As such, this article attempts to shift the focus away from the rule–mechanic relation, and from a cybersemiotic perspective, to refocus it on a conceptualization of the human–machine relationship. In order to do so, the concept of convolution regarding said relation is defined, including both parts of the video game system in terms of signal processing. Likewise, this model is contrasted with a randomized total sample of 1,200 games (N = 1,200, n = 300) in order to arrive at a set of conclusions about the behavior of the distinct video game genres in the indicated terms. © The Author(s) 2019.","abduction; cognitive approach; cybersemiotics; ludology; signal processing; video game genres",,,,,,,,,"Aarseth, E.J., (1997) Cybertext: Perspectives on ergodic literature, , Baltimore, MD, Johns Hopkins University Press; Adams, E., Dormans, J., (2012) Game mechanics: Advanced game design, , Berkeley, CA, New Riders Games; (1982) E.T.

The current inquiry seeks to fill this gap in the literature through an autoethnographic case study of the video game The Escapists, in which players assume the role of an inmate whose ultimate goal is to escape prison amid an environment populated by other nonplayer character inmates and guards. In this inquiry, specific attention is paid to the player’s experiences as a subject of control from guards, inmates, surveillance systems, and the prison construct, and how these interactions contextualize and potentially motivate the player to attempt escape. Connections between virtual and real-world escape attempts are discussed. Conceptual and theoretical links between total control and interactive experiences of simulated prison life, as well as implications of this study, are examined. © The Author(s) 2016.","corrections; institutionalization; prison escape; total control; video games",,,,,,,,,"(1997) Shadow Warrior, , PC, New York, NY, GT Interactive; (2002) Elder Scrolls: Morrowind, , PC, XBox, Rockville, MD, Bethesda Game Studios; (2006) Elder Scrolls: Oblivion, , PC, PlayStation, XBox, Rockville, MD, Bethesda Game Studios; (2011) Elder Scrolls: Skyrim, , PC, PlayStation, XBox, Rockville, MD, Bethesda Game Studios; (2004) Fable, , PC, Xbox, Redmond, WA, Microsoft Game Studios; (2004) World of Warcraft, , PC, Irvine, CA, Blizzard Entertainment; (2010) Prison Break, , PC, Xbox, PlayStation 3, Planegg, Germany, Deep Silver; (2011) Dark Souls, , PC, Xbox, PlayStation 3, Santa Clara, CA, Bandai Namco Games; (2012) Prison Architect, , PC and Mac OS, Surrey, England, Introversion Software; (2014) The Escapists, , PC, Ossett, England, Team17 Digital; (2012) Escaping the Prison, , http://www.stickpage.com/escapingtheprisongameplay.shtml, Retrieved August 3, 2015, from; (2004) Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas, , Android, iOS, Mac, PC, Playstation, XBox, New York, NY, Rockstar Games; (1991) Streets of Rage, , Sega, PC, Tokyo, Japan, Sega; (2005) Prison Tycoon, , PC, Carson, CA, ValuSoft; (2004) The Chronicles of Riddick: Escape from Butcher Bay, , PC, XBox, Stockholm, Sweden, Starbreeze Studios/Targon Studios; Aarseth, E., (2003) Playing research: Methodological approaches to game analysis, , Paper presentend at the Digital Arts and Culture Conference, Melbourne, Australia; Adachi, P., Willoughby, T., The effect of video game competition and violence on aggressive behavior: Which characteristics have the greatest influence?

Rather than representing a wholly new development in gaming, these games may participate in a larger media ecology that flatters a neoliberal worldview. This research calls for greater attention to the coercive economic assumptions encoded in game mechanics. Drawing on scholarship in ludology, postcolonial studies, and phenomenology, it suggests that sandbox games like Minecraft habituate players to myths of empire and capital that rationalize political and economic inequality. More than simply offering a blank slate for player creation, Minecraft rewards players for assuming their entitlement to the world’s resources and thus their superiority over other inhabitants of the game world. © The Author(s) 2016.","economics; empire; labor; Minecraft; neoliberal; postcolonial; race",,,,,,,,,"Achebe, C., An image of Africa: Racism in Conrad’s Heart of Darkness (2010) The Norton anthology of theory and criticism, pp. 1612-1623. , Leitch V.B., (ed), 2nd ed, New York, NY, Norton, (Ed.), (,.,., –; Bogost, I., (2007) Persuasive games: The expressive power of video games, , Cambridge, MA, The MIT Press; Bogost, I., (2011) How to do things with videogames, , Minneapolis, University of Minnesota Press; Brennan, T., (2014) Borrowed light: Vico, Hegel, and the colonies, , Stanford, CA, Stanford University Press; Davies, M., Blockbuster—The making of Minecraft (2012) PC Gamer, , http://www.pcgamer.com/the-making-of-minecraft/, Retrieved from; De Paoli, S., Automatic-play and player deskilling in MMORPGs (2013) Game Studies, p. 13. , http://gamestudies.org/1301/articles/depaoli_automatic_play, Retrieved from; Duncan, S.C., Minecraft, beyond construction and survival (2011) Well Played, 1, pp. 1-22; Dyer-Witheford, N., de Peuter, G., (2009) Games of empire: Global capitalism and video games, , Minneapolis, University of Minnesota Press; Ferguson, C.J., Does media violence predict societal violence?

Drawing upon the works of Robert Rosenstone and Astrid Erll, we develop concepts and theories from film studies and adapt them to respond to the media specificity of computer games. Through a critical reading of the first chapter of the history-based first-person shooter Call of Duty: Black Ops, the article demonstrates how the game’s formal properties frame in-game experiences and performances, and this way predisposes the emergence of certain memory-making potentials in and through constrained practices of play. Subsequently, an analysis of the serious game Czechoslovakia 38-89: Assassination shows the potentials of game design to facilitate meta-historical reflections and critical inquiries. © The Author(s) 2016.","Call of Duty: Black Ops; Czechoslovakia 38-89: Assassination; game studies; history; memory politics; memory studies; simulation",,,,,,,,,"(2010) Call of Duty: Black Ops, , Santa Monica, CA, Treyarch; Assmann, J., (1992) Das kulturelle Gedächtnis, , München, Germany, Beck; Assmann, J., Communicative and cultural memory (2008) Cultural memory studies: An interdisciplinary handbook, p. 109. , Erll A., Nünning A., (eds), Berlin, Germany, Walter de Gruyter, (Eds.), (., −118; Call of Duty Breaks Sales Record (2010) CBC News, , http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/call-of-duty-breaks-sales-record-1.949952, Retrieved from, (, a; (2010) Cuba Denounces ‘Virtual’ Castro Plot in New Game, , http://wayback.archive.org/web/20101113200931/http://finance.yahoo.com/news/Cuba-denounces-virtual-Castro-apf-2373678391.html?x=0&.v=4, Retrieved from, (, b; Bavelier, D., Your brain on video games (2012) TEDxCHUV, , http://www.ted.com/talks/daphne_bavelier_your_brain_on_video_games#t-10041, Retrieved from; Bogost, I., (2007) Persuasive games: The expressive power of video games, , Cambridge, England, MIT Press; Bohning, D., (2005) The Castro Obsession: U.S. Covert Operations Against Cuba 1959-1965, , Dulles, Virginia, Potomac Books; Bond, P., Call of Duty: Black Ops” Is Best-Selling Video Game Ever in US (2011) The Hollywood Reporter, , http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/call-duty-black-ops-is-166625, Retrieved from; Butler, J., (2009) Frames of war: When is life grievable?, , London, England, Verso; Chapman, A., Privileging form over content: Analysing historical videogames (2012) Journal of Digital Humanities, 1. , http://journalofdigitalhumanities.org/1-2/privileging-form-over-content-by-adam-chapman/, Retreived from; Chapman, A., Is Sid Meier’s civilization history?

The analyses bring into dialogue film scholarship which has sought to understand a comparable trend in cinema with games scholarship, most notably Darley’s discussion of narrative “decentering” and Bogost’s notion of “procedural rhetoric.” In all three games, the core gameplay in which players are rewarded for repetition of violent behaviors is juxtaposed with ambivalent narrative-contextual aspects. However, in the more overtly “multidimensional” video games medium, this juxtaposition plays out in a more fractured manner than in the flatter visual space of cinema. © The Author(s) 2016.","ambivalence; film violence; procedural rhetoric; textual analysis; violent video games",,,,,,,,,"Aldred, J., Greenspan, B., A man chooses, a slave obeys: Bioshock and the dystopian logic of convergence (2011) Games and Culture, 6, pp. 479-496; Anderson, C.A., Dill, K.E., Video games and aggressive thoughts, feelings, and behavior in the laboratory and in life (2000) Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 78, pp. 772-790; Arnheim, R., (2006) Film as art, , Berkeley, University of California Press; Atkins, B., (2003) More than a game: The computer game as fictional form, , Manchester, Manchester University Press; Atkins, B., What are we really looking at?

In psychological work with adolescents, there is a stark similarity between what they experience and some concepts of existentialist philosophy. Sartre’s script for the movie Les Jeux Sont Faits (literally “games are made”) uses the same narrative strategy as Life is Strange—the capacity for the main characters to travel back in time to change their own existence—in order to stimulate philosophical, ethical, and political thinking and also to effectively simulate existential “limit situations.” This article is a dialogue between Sartre’s views and Life is Strange in order to examine to what extent questions such as what is freedom? what is choice? what is autonomy and responsibility? can be interpreted anew in hybrid digital–human—“anthrobotic”—environments. © The Author(s) 2016.","anthrobotics; autonomy; choice; existential simulator; Les Jeux Sont Faits; Life is Strange; philosophy; Sartre; video game",,,,,,,,,"Bateson, G., Jackson, D., Haley, J., Weakland, J., Toward a theory of schizophrenia (1956) Behavioural Science, 1, pp. 251-254; Breen, D., Metaphorical thinking with adolescents (2005) Play therapy with adolescents, pp. 159-175. , Gallo-Lopez L., Schaefer C.E., (eds), Oxford, England, Jason Aronson, (Eds.), (., –; Calvin, A., (2016) Life is good: Dontnod on the success of life is strange and what comes next, , http://www.mcvuk.com/news/read/life-is-good-dontnod-on-the-success-of-life-is-strange-and-what-comes-next/0164045, interview, Retrieved April 5, 2016, from, [,]; Cogburn, J., Silcox, M., (2008) Philosophy through videogames, , London, England, Routledge; de Miranda, L., (2015) Life is Strange-Interview with the creators of Life is Strange, , https://archive.org/details/20150912122333, Retrieved January 7, 2016, from; de Miranda, L., Rovatsos, M., Ramamoorthy, S., ).

Using a phenomenological approach, the research focuses on rhythmic experience within games and, in particular, on the rhythm of tree chopping within the games Minecraft and Don’t Starve. Graphic, aural, and embodied representations are used to closely analyze and compare a single-player experience within the two games. The analysis reflects on the efficacy of these methods and suggests some possible key factors for designing rhythmically expressive play experiences. It is suggested that combining real-time control with perceivable and performable repetition and variety can give the player expressive creative control over the rhythms of their performed interactions, potentially enriching their experience of repetitive tasks and extending the play life of a game. © The Author(s) 2016.","Don’t Starve;

It demonstrated how seemingly ephemeral media created echo chambers of anger, and how the outbursts of hypermasculine aggression exemplified by hooligans also can connect to games and play. Starting from how GG gained popular attention, this article outlines and discusses the nature of GG, the relation to the victims, the sense of victimization among the participants, and how it may have been provoked by the long-standing, general disregard of games as a culture and a cultural artifact of value. It discusses GG as a swarm using this metaphor to describe its self-organizing nature. Further comparing GG to hooligans, this article also introduces a class and marginalization aspect to understanding the event, opening up for discourses that complicates the image of game culture as mainly a culture of isolated consumption. © The Author(s) 2016.","#GamerGate; activism; game culture; game studies; gamers; gender; harassment; hooligans; image boards; Internet research",,,,,,,,,"Aarseth, E., Editorial, game studies 0101 (2001) Gamestudies.org, 1. , http://www.gamestudies.org/0101/editorial.html, Retrieved from; Alexander, L., Gamers” don’t have to be your audience. “Gamers” are over (2014) Gamasutra: The Art and Business of Making Games, , http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/224400/Gamers_dont_have_to_be_your_audience_Gamers_are_over.php, Retrieved from; Allen, J., How imageboard culture shaped Gamergate (2014) BoingBoing, , http://boingboing.net/2014/12/31/how-imageboard-culture-shaped.html, Hudson L., (ed), Jason Weisberger, Retrieved from, (Ed; Allen, J., How crowdfunding helps haters profit from harassment—Boing Boing (2015) Boing Boing, , http://boingboing.net/2015/01/14/how-crowdfunding-helps-haters.html, Retrieved from; Baio, A., (2014) 72 Hours of #Gamergate—The Message—Medium, , https://medium.com/message/72-hours-of-gamergate-e00513f7cf5d, Retrieved August 30, 2015, from; Baron, N.S., (2008) Always on: Language in an online and mobile world, , New York, NY, Oxford University Press; Batchelor, J., Games developers must fight internet abuse together (2014) Develop, , http://www.develop-online.net/analysis/games-developers-must-fight-internet-abuse-together/0199849, 11, 10, Retrieved from; Bernstein, J., Gaming is leaving “gamers” behind (2014) BuzzFeedNews, , http://www.buzzfeed.com/josephbernstein/gaming-is-leaving-gamers-behind#.nje2wlVA9w, 8, 28, Retrieved from; Bernstein, M.S., Monroy-Hernández, A., Harry, D., André, P., Panovich, K., Vargas, G., (2011) 4chan and /b/: An analysis of anonymity and ephemerality in a large online community, (Coleman), pp. 50-57. , http://doi.org/10.1.1.207.9761, Retrieved from; Bokhari, A., GamerGate: A year in review–Breitbart (2015) Breitbart.com, , http://www.breitbart.com/big-journalism/2015/09/15/gamergate-a-year-in-review/, 9, 15, Retrieved from; Brimson, D., Brimson, E., (1996) Everywhere we go: Hooligan series—Book one, , Kindle ed, 2011 ed, UK, Category C Publishing; Calvey, D., The art and politics of covert research: Doing ‘situated ethics’ in the field (2008) Sociology, 42, pp. 905-918. , http://doi.org/10.1177/0038038508094569; Alleged terror plot aimed at 9/11 anniversary foiled–CBS News (2015) CBS Interactive, , http://www.cbsnews.com/news/alleged-911-terror-plot-florida-man-joshua-goldberg-posed-as-muslim-in-australia/, 9, 11, Retrieved from; Chess, S., Shaw, A., A conspiracy of fishes, or, how we learned to stop worrying about #GamerGate and embrace hegemonic masculinity (2015) Journal of Broadcasting & Electronic Media, 59, pp. 208-220. , http://doi.org/10.1080/08838151.2014.999917; Chu, A., It’s dangerous to go alone: Why are gamers so angry?

When Valve and Bethesda (publisher and developer of Skyrim) decided to allow mods to be sold by mod makers themselves, there ensued a community revolt against the commodification of leisure and play. I put this crisis of play and work in dialogue with Harvey’s concept of “accumulation by dispossession,” firmly placing it within a longer history of disruptive capital accumulation strategies. I then conduct a discourse analysis of community members on reddit, as they make sense of and come to terms with this process of dispossession. Arising in the discourse was not class consciousness per se, but instead a pervasive feeling of helplessness and frustration as games, play, and leisure began to feel like work. © The Author(s) 2018.","digital distribution; digital labor; discourse analysis; game studies; platform studies; play; Steam",,,,,,,,,"Bell, D., (1965) The end of ideology: On the exhaustion of political ideas in the fifties, , Rev. ed, New York, NY, Free Press; Bell, D., (1976) The coming of post-industrial society: A venture in social forecasting, , Reissue ed, New York, NY, Basic Books; (2017) Creation club, , creationclub.bethesda.net, Retrieved June 28, 2017, from; Caffentzis, C.G., (2013) In letters of blood and fire: Work, machines, and the crisis of capitalism, , Oakland, CA, PM Press; Caillois, R., (1958) Man, play and games, , Paperback, Urbana, University of Illinois Press; Castells, M., (2009) The rise of the network society: The information age: Economy, society, and culture, I. , 2nd ed, Malden, MA, Wiley-Blackwell; (1981), Baltimore, Maryland, Muse Software; Deuze, M., Martin, C., Allen, C., The professional identity of gameworkers (2007) Convergence, 13, pp. 335-353. , https://doi.org/10.1177/1354856507081947, Retrieved from; Dibbell, J., The Chinese game room: Play, productivity and computing at their limits (2009) Artifact, 2, pp. 82-87; (1993), Dallas, Texas, id Software; Dyer-Witheford, N., de Peuter, G., (2009) Games of empire: Global capitalism and videogames, , Minneapolis, University of Minnesota Press; Fisher, S.J., Harvey, A., Intervention for inclusivity: Gender politics and indie game development (2013) Loading…, 7, pp. 25-40; Gillespie, T., The politics of “platforms.

I will suggest explanations as to why this is the case, including the kinds of affect generated by LEGO and LEGO narratives as they are transmediated across platforms, from bricks, to animation shorts, to The LEGO Movie.

The article examines two specific projects—a single-site 24-hr event that took place in 2012 and a restaging of the format 4 years later across five different sites in the United Kingdom. These two case studies offer two critical contributions to the ongoing research regarding the wider challenges of diversifying games design, games development, and games culture more generally. The first is a consideration of the range of labors—free, hopeful, and affective—that underpins these endeavors and provides a significant contribution in general to the ludic economy. The second is valuable evidence of the impact and ongoing validity of these all-female initiatives as an effective and transformative methodology for feminist intervention. © The Author(s) 2018.","affective labor; feminism; game jam; games industry; methodology",,,,,,"Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada, SSHRC: .146358, 2015-04","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: Re-figuring innovation in games Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council (n/a, Canada) 2015-04 to 2017-03 | Grant Grant: grant.146358.",,"Anderson, B., Becoming and being hopeful: Towards a theory of affect (2006) Environment and Planning D: Society and Space, 24, pp. 733-752; Banks, J., Deuze, M., Co-creative labour (2009) International Journal of Cultural Studies, 12, pp. 419-431; Batchelor, J., The Global Game Jam is a counter-movement to increased nationalistic tendencies (2017) Games Industry Biz, , https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2017-01-19-the-global-game-jam-is-a-counter-movement-to-increased-nationalistic-tendencies, Retrieved July, 2017, from; Coleman, R., A sensory sociology of the future: Affect, hope and inventive methodologies (2016) The Sociological Review, 60, pp. 18-39; Conor, B., Gill, R., Taylor, S., Gender and creative labour (2015) The Sociological Review, 63, pp. 1-22; Cornish, S., Farber, M., Fleming, A., Miklasz, K., (2017) The game jam guide, , http://respository.cmu.edu/etcpress/68, Pittsburgh, PA, Carnegie Mellon University, Retrieved from; Duffy, B.E., The romance of work: Gender and aspirational labour in the digital culture industries (2015) International Journal of Cultural Studies, 19, pp. 441-457; Gill, R., Cool, creative and egalitarian?

Through an analysis of popular discourse about the game in dialogue with its play experience, this article showcases the ways in which this scrutiny is tied to value judgments about celebrity culture, affective labor, and emerging monetization strategies in games. By exploring the game’s content, mechanics, and economics, I argue that KK: H’s mixed reception is a product of how these make visible celebrity labor and the work of self-branding, intimacy, and engagement in the attentional economy of social media. Through its form and functioning, this game reveals the intensities of women’s work in low-status activities, across play and celebrity culture, and, through this, challenges their devaluation. It is via this simulation of invisible labor, I argue, that KK: H represents an exemplar of what new ludic economies can indicate about the future of digital play. © The Author(s) 2018.","affective labor; authenticity; celebrity; monetization; self-branding; simulation; women’s work",,,,,,,,,"Allen, K., Girls imagining careers in the limelight: Social class, gender, and fantasies of ‘success’ (2011) In the limelight and under the microscope: Forms and functions of female celebrity, pp. 149-173. , Holmes S., Negra D., (eds), London, England, Continuum, (Eds.), (., –; Anable, A., Casual games, time management, and the work of affect (2013) Ada: A Journal of Gender, New Media, and Technology; Bogost, I., The rhetoric of video games (2008) The ecology of games: Connecting youth, games, and learning, pp. 117-139. , Salen K., (ed), Cambridge, MA, MIT Press, (Ed.), (., –; Chess, S., Going with the Flo: Diner Dash and feminism (2012) Feminist Media Studies, 12, pp. 83-99; Chess, S., A time for play: Interstitial time, Invest/Express games, and feminine leisure style (2016) New Media & Society; Cross, K., Ethics for cyborgs: On real harassment in an ‘unreal’ place (2014) Loading…The Journal of the Canadian Game Studies Association, 8, pp. 4-21; Curry, R., Toward a unified theory of Kim Kardashian: Hollywood (2014) Brooklyn Magazine, , http://www.bkmag.com/2014/09/10/toward-a-unified-theory-of-kim-kardashian-hollywood/, 10, 9, Retrieved from; De Castell, S., Bryson, M., Re-tooling play: Dystopia, dysphoria and difference (1998) From Barbie to Mortal Kombat: Girls and computer games, pp. 232-261. , Cassell J., Jenkins H., (eds), Cambridge, MA, MIT Press, (Eds.), (., –; Fron, J., Fullerton, T., Morie, J.F., Pearce, C., The hegemony of play (2007) Situated Play: Proceedings of the 2007 Digital Games Research Association Conference, pp. 308-319. , http://ict.usc.edu/pubs/The%20Hegemony%20of%20Play.pdf, Retrieved from, (., –; Garber, M., Kapitalism, with Kim Kardashian (2014) The Atlantic, , http://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2014/07/lessons-in-capitalism-from-kim-kardashian/375252/, 7, 29, Retrieved from; Genz, S., My job is me: Postfeminist celebrity culture and the gendering of authenticity (2015) Feminist Media Studies, 15, pp. 545-561; Goggin, J., Regulating (virtual) subjects: Finance, entertainment and games (2012) Journal of Cultural Economy, 5, pp. 441-456; Holmes, S., Negra, D., (2011) In the limelight and under the microscope: Forms and functions of female celebrity, , London, England, Continuum, (Eds; Horton, D., Wohl, R.R., Mass communication and para-social interaction: Observations on intimacy at a distance (1956) Psychiatry, 19, pp. 215-229; Jenson, J., de Castell, S., Tipping points: Marginality, misogyny, and videogames (2013) Journal of Curriculum Theorizing, 29, pp. 72-81; Kafai, Y.B., Gender differences in children’s constructions of video games (1996) Interacting with video, pp. 39-66. , Greenfield P.M., Cocking R.R., (eds), Norwood, NJ, Ablex Publishing Corporation, (Eds.), (., –; Keller, J.M., Fiercely real?

The articles here focus on a range of issues related to both mainstream profit models including digital distribution platforms and mobile games as well as peripheral game economies such as jams and indie production. Each of the studies share an attunement to the tensions and contradictions embedded within what are commonly approached as matter-of-fact within traditional economic analysis of games. Rather than framing industrial changes as necessarily either overdetermined exploitation (of workers in the mainstream games industry, players and their ‘free’ labour) or emancipatory and progressive (new forms of creative production, play, resistance), they address the specificity and peculiarity of game economies at both the micro- and macro-levels of industry, technology, and everyday play culture. And rather than simply countering a pessimistic picture with other, more progressive examples of contemporary game culture such as ‘games for change’, art practices and political interventions—as important as these are—the contributions to this special issue instead track the contradictions and tensions within game cultures and economies as reflections of those within the late capitalist and patriarchal cultural economy at large. © The Author(s) 2018.","affective labor; game industry; game studies; ludic economies; political economy",,,,,,,,,"Crogan, P., Indie dreams: Video games, creative economy and the hyperindustrial epoch (2018) Games and Culture, 13, pp. 671-689; Dyer-Witheford, N., de Peuter, G., (2009) Games of empire: Global capitalism and video games, , Minneapolis, University of Minnesota Press; Giddings, S., Accursed play: The economic imaginary of game studies (2018) Games and Culture, 13, pp. 765-783; Goggin, J., Regulating (virtual) subjects: Finance, entertainment and games (2012) Journal of Cultural Economy, 5, pp. 441-456; Goggin, J., Fan labour and the power of cuteness (2018) Games and Culture, 13, pp. 747-764; Harvey, A., The fame game: Working your way up the celebrity ladder in Kim Kardashian: Hollywood (2018) Games and Culture, 13, pp. 652-670; Jenson, J., de Castell, S., The entrepreneurial gamer”: Re-gendering the order of play (2018) Games and Culture, 13, pp. 728-746; Joseph, D., The discourse of digital dispossession: Paid modifications and community crisis on Steam (2018) Games and Culture, 13, pp. 690-707; Kennedy, H.W., Game jam as feminist methodology: The affective labours of intervention in the ludic economy (2018) Games and Culture, 13, pp. 708-727; Kerr, A., (2006) The business and culture of digital games: Gamework/gameplay, , London, England, Sage; Kerr, A., (2017) Global games: Production, circulation and policy in the networked era, , London, England, Routledge; Kocurek, C., (2015) Coin-operated Americans: Rebooting boyhood at the video game arcade, , Minneapolis, University of Minnesota Press; Nieborg, D., From premium to freemium: The political economy of the app (2015) Social, casual and mobile games: The changing gaming landscape, pp. 225-240. , Leaver T., Willson M., (eds), New York, NY, Bloomsbury Academic, (Eds.), (., –; Wark, M., A ludic century?

Although a growing body of research has explored some of the titles involved in this shift, little remains known of its overall scope and contents. This article provides a mapping of the initial “boom” in children’s virtual worlds development and identifies a number of significant patterns within the ensuing children’s virtual worlds landscape. The argument is made that while the reported boom in children’s virtual worlds has been exaggerated, a number of important shifts for online gaming culture did unfold during this period, some of which challenge accepted definitions of “virtual world” and “multiplayer online game.” The implications of these findings are discussed in light of contemporary developments and trends within children’s digital culture and within online gaming more broadly. © The Author(s) 2016.","children’s MMOGs; children’s virtual worlds; commercial culture; history; political economy",,,,,,"Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada, SSHRC","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This research was supported by the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada.",,"Aarsand, P.A., Computer and video games in family life: The digital divide as a resource in intergenerational interactions (2007) Childhood, 14, pp. 235-256; Barnes, B., Web playgrounds of the very young (2007) The New York Times, , http://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/31/business/31virtual.html, 12, 31, Retrieved from; Bell, M., Toward a definition of virtual worlds (2008) Journal of Virtual Worlds Research, 1, pp. 2-5; Black, R., The language of Webkinz: Early childhood literacy in an online virtual world (2010) Digital Culture & Education, 2, pp. 7-24; (2008) BBC News, , http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/7390218.stm, 5, 9, Retrieved from; Bruckman, A., (1997) MOOSE Crossing: Construction, community, and learning in a networked virtual world for kids, , Unpublished doctoral dissertation, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA; Burke, A., Marsh, J., Introduction: The changing landscape of children’s play worlds (2013) Children’s virtual play worlds: Culture, learning, and participation, pp. 1-9. , Burke A., Marsh J., (eds), New York, NY, Peter Lang, (Eds.), (., –; Caillois, R., (2001) Man, play and games, , Chicago, University of Illinois Press; Carrington, V., Hodgetts, K., Literacy-lite in BarbieGirls™ (2010) British Journal of Sociology of Education, 31, pp. 671-682; Castronova, E., (2005) Synthetic worlds: The business and culture of online games, , Chicago, IL, The University of Chicago Press; Cody, K., BeTween two worlds”: Critically exploring marketing segmentation and liminal consumers (2012) Young Consumers, 13, pp. 284-302; Consalvo, M., MOOs to MMOs: The internet and virtual worlds (2011) The handbook of internet studies, pp. 339-347. , Consalvo M., Ess C., (eds), Malden, MA, Wiley-Blackwell, (Eds.), (., –; (2004) Press release, , http://corporate.disney.go.com/wdig/news_release/2004/may_24_2004.html, 5, 25, Retrieved from; Fullerton, T., Ford Morie, J., Pearce, C., A game of one’s own: Towards a new gendered poetics of digital space (2008) Fibreculture, , http://eleven.fibreculturejournal.org/fcj-074-a-game-of-one%e2%80%99s-own-towards-a-new-gendered-poetics-of-digital-space/, Retrieved from; Gallagher, R., No sex please, we are finite state machines: On the melancholy sexlessness of the video game (2012) Games and Culture, 7, pp. 399-418; Gee, J.P., (2003) What video games have to teach us about learning and literacy, , New York, NY, Palgrave Macmillan; Gibson, N., Child’s play: Why the tide is turning toward making games for kids (2008) Develop Magazine, , http://www.developmag.com/interviews/223/Childs-Play, 6, 30, Retrieved February 3, 2009, from; Goltz, N., ESRB warning: Use of virtual worlds by children may result in addiction and blurring of borders—The advisable regulations in light of foreseeable damages (2010) Pittsburgh Journal of Technology Law and Policy, 11, pp. 1-63; Greene, M., Fascinating yet horrifying: The Barbie and Bratz MMOs (2007) Kotaku, , http://www.kotaku.com.au/2007/08/fascinating_yet_horrifying_the/, 8, 12, Retrieved from; Greenspan, R., Kids are media users too (2003) ClickZ, , http://www.clickz.com/stats/big_picture/demographics/article.php/5901_3089701, 10, 9, Retrieved from; Grimes, S.M., Child-generated content: Children’s authorship and interpretive practices in digital gaming cultures (2014) Dynamic fair dealing: Creating Canadian culture online, pp. 336-345. , Coombe R.J., Wershler D., (eds), Toronto, Canada, University of Toronto Press, (Eds.), (., –; Grimes, S.M., Playing by the market rules: Promotional priorities and commercialization in children’s virtual worlds (2015) Journal of Consumer Culture, 15, pp. 110-134; Grimes, S.M., Feenberg, A., Rationalizing play: A critical theory of digital gaming (2009) Information Society, 25, pp. 105-118; Grimes, S.M., Shade, L.R., Neopian economics of play: Children’s cyberpets and online communities as immersive advertising in Neopets.com (2005) International Journal of Media & Cultural Politics, 1, pp. 181-198; Harambam, J., Aupers, S., Houtman, D., Game over?

This includes an integration of processes of production and distribution, various levels of textual analysis, and audience reception.

The main goal of this article is to highlight overarching themes and patterns in the literature, with a focus on theories and methodologies commonly used and the way game studies is still risk aware, even awkward in its discussions of sexuality. In addition to a review of 37 years of literature, the article employs a chronological and thematic metaphor analysis of past research texts to analyze whether game studies is growing up or in perpetual puberty and whether it really is exploring sexual maturity alongside the games we study. It finds that while different periods of time can be identified in research as far as approaches to sexuality in games go, game studies is still to a large extent engaged in the management of the stigma that discussing sexuality may cause. Rather than a maturation process, the waves are shown to be manifestations of different types of environmentally influenced risk awareness, consecutive risk avoidance, and a resulting awkwardness. © The Author(s) 2016.","critical meta-analysis; game studies; methodology; sexuality; theory",,,,,,"Academy of Finland: 275421","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: Parts of this article were supported by the Academy of Finland for funding Ludification and the Emergence of Playful Culture (decision #275421) project.",,"Aarseth, E., Computer game studies: Year one (2001) Game Studies, 1, pp. 1-15; Anderson, C., Berkowitz, E., Donnerstein, E., Huesmann, R., Johnson, J., Liz, D., The influence of media violence on youth (2003) Psychological Science in the Public Health, 4, pp. 81-110. , …; Anderson, C., Shibuya, A., Nobuko, I., Swing, E., Bushman, B., Sakamoto, A., Violent video game effects on aggression, empathy, and prosocial behaviour in Eastern and Western Countries: A meta-analytic review (2010) Psychological Bulletin, 136, pp. 179-181. , …; Barrowcliffe, M., (2007) The elfish gene: Dungeons, dragons and growing up strange, , New York, NY, MacMillian; Bataille, G., (1952) L’erotisme, , Eroticism, Paris, France, Les Editions de Minuit, [,]; Betcher, W., (1987) Intimate play: Creating romance in everyday life, , New York, NY, Penguin Books; Boellstorff, T., (2008) Coming of age in Second Life: An anthropologist explores the virtually human, , Oxford, England, Princeton University Press; Brathwaite, B., (2006) Sex in video games, , Boston, MA, Charles River Media; Brown, A., ‘No one-handed typing’: An exploration of cheats and spoilsports in an erotic role play community in World of Warcraft (2012) Journal of Gaming and Virtual Worlds, 4, pp. 259-273; Brown, A., (2015) Sexuality in role-playing games, , New York, NY, Taylor & Francis; Burn, A., Reworking the text: Online fandom (2006) Computer games: Text, narrative and play, pp. 88-102. , Carr D., Buckingham D., Burn A., Schott G., (eds), Cambridge, England, Polity Press, (Eds.), (., –; Cairns, K.V., Woodward, J.B., Savery, J., The life choices simulation (1989) Simulation & Gaming, 20, pp. 245-271; Caldecott, S., Tolkien’s project (2008) Tolkien’s the lord of the rings: Sources of inspiration, pp. 211-232. , Caldecott S., Honeggar T., (eds), Zollikofen, Switzerland, Walking Tree, (Eds.), (., –; Campbell, J.E., (2004) Getting it on online: Cyberspace, gay male sexuality, and embodied identity, , London, England, Harrington Park Press; Castronova, E., (2005) Synthetic worlds: The business and culture of online games, , Chicago, IL, Chicago University Press; Cohen, S., (1972) Folk devils and moral panics: The creation of the mods and rockers, , London, England, MacGibbon & Kee; De Vries, K., Mint, P., Polyamory + technology = sexual and romantic abundance (2011) Of intercourse and intracourse: Sexuality, biomodification and the techno-social sphere, pp. 166-171. , Grenzfurthener J., Friesinger G., Fabry D., (eds), San Francisco, CA, RE/Search, (Eds.), (., –; Dibbell, J., A rape in cyberspace (1993) Village Voice, 38, pp. 36-42; Döring, N., Feminist views of cybersex: Victimization, liberation, and empowerment (2004) CyberPsychology & Behavior, 3, pp. 863-884; Dovey, J., Kennedy, H., (2006) Game cultures: Computer games as new media, , New York, NY, Open University Press; Duke, R.D., (1974) Gaming: The future’s language, , New York, NY, Halsted Press; Eerikäinen, H., (2014) Cybersex and prosthetic god. “Sex,” desire and the posthuman body in cyber discourse, , Doctoral dissertation, University of Lapland, Rovaniemi; (2012) World of Warcraft Cataclysm rated teen, , http://www.esrb.org/ratings/search.jsp, Retrieved December 1, 2015, from; Ferguson, C., Kilburn, J., Much Ado about nothing: The misestimation and overinterpretation of violent videogame effects in eastern and western nations: Comment on Anderson et al.

It draws from an ethnographically inspired study of the players of a Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game (MMORPG) that is explored through three key dimensions: space, time, and language. Drawing on concepts developed by Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari, I argue that the notion of nativeness, in the case of virtual communities, is best approached as a performance embedded in the process of becoming. In that sense, one is not but rather becomes a member of a virtual community. This process of becoming entails an exploration of smooth forms of space and the appropriation of a vernacular form of language. © 2015, The Author(s) 2015.","Gilles Deleuze; language; nativeness; spatiality; temporality; virtual communities",,,,,,,,,"Anderson, W.T., Communities in a world of open systems (1999) Futures, 31, pp. 457-463; Anis, J., Neography: Unconventional spelling in French SMS text messages (2007) The multilingual internet: Language, culture, and communication online, pp. 87-115. , Danet B., Herring S.C., (eds), Oxford, England, Oxford University Press, (Eds.), (., –; Aycock, A., Buchignani, N., The e-mail murders: Reflections on ‘dead’ letters (1995) CyberSociety: Computer-mediated communication and community, pp. 184-232. , Jones S.G., (ed), London, England, Sage, (Ed.), (., –; Bagozzi, R.P., Dholakia, U.M., Intentional social actions in virtual communities (2002) Journal of Interactive Marketing, 16, pp. 2-21; Bakardjieva, M., Virtual togetherness: An every-day life perspective (2003) Media, Culture & Society, 25, pp. 291-313; Bayne, S., Smoothness and striation in digital learning spaces (2004) E-learning, 1, pp. 302-316; Beaulieu, A., Mediating ethnography: Objectivity and the making of ethnographies of the internet (2004) Social Epistemology, 18, pp. 139-163; Ben-Ze’ev, A., (2004) Love online: Emotions on the Internet, , Cambridge, England, Cambridge University Press; Boellstorff, T., A ludicrous discipline?

The author demonstrates how video games make their players undertake a synthesis of work and play via a process of psychological and physical self-modification. This interrelation between work, play, and subjectivity modification within gameplay experiences embodies the same ideological framework that governs many knowledge-based economies which thrive off of user-generated content. In using the work/play/subjectivity connection to locate similarities between video games and the logic of globalist paradigms, the author presents a revised understanding of what constitutes the political dimensions of video games and the experiences they elicit in their players. This article concludes with an analysis of how the mechanics and narrative of Papers, Please embodies the cultural mind-set of work-as-play while simultaneously challenging the discourses often applied to user-focused information technologies. © 2015, The Author(s) 2015.","aesthetics; globalism; labor; politics; subjectivity",,,,,,,,,"Aarseth, E., (1997) Cybertext: Perspectives on Ergodic Literature, , Baltimore, MD, Johns Hopkins University Press; Abbate, J., (2000) Inventing the Internet, , Cambridge, Massachusetts Institute of Technology Press; Benjamin, W., (1968) Illuminations, , Boston, MA, Houghton Mifflin Harcourt; Bogost, I., Exploitationware (2013) Rhetoric/composition/play through video games, pp. 139-148. , Colby R., Johnson M., Colby R., (eds), New York, NY, Palgrave Macmillan, (Eds.), (., –; Castronova, E., On virtual economies (2003) Game Studies, 3. , http://www.gamestudies.org/0302/castronova/, Retrieved from; Costantini, C., New “Papers, Please” video game may surprise you (2013) ABCnews.com, , http://abcnews.go.com/ABC_Univision/papers-game-surprise/story?id=19135556, Retrieved from; Cullen, J., Lucas pope: ‘I’m kind of sick to death of papers, please (2014) VG247.com, , http://www.vg247.com/2014/03/05/lucas-pope-im-kind-of-sick-to-death-of-papers-please/3/, Retrieved from; Dyer-Witheford, N., de Peuter, G., (2009) Games of empire: Global capitalism and video games, , Minneapolis, University of Minnesota Press; Foucault, M., The subject and power (2004) The essential Foucault, pp. 128-144. , Rabinow P., Rose N., (eds), New York, NY, The New Press, (Eds.), (., –; Foucault, M., (2008) The birth of biopolitics: Lecture at the college de France, 1978-1979, , New York, NY, Palgrave Macmillan; Gee, J.P., (2007) What video games have to teach us about learning and literacy, , New York, NY, Palgrave Macmillan; Grimes, S., Feenberg, A., Rationalizing play: A critical theory of digital gaming (2009) The Information Society, 25, pp. 105-118; Hardt, M., Negri, A., (2005) Multitude: War and democracy in the age of empire, , New York, NY, Penguin; Ito, M., (2012) Engineering play: A cultural history of children’s software, , Cambridge, The Massachusetts Institute of Technology Press; Jenkins, H., (2008) Convergence culture: Where old and new media collide, , New York, New York University Press; Johnson, D., Animated frustration or the ambivalence of player agency (2015) Games and Culture, 10, pp. 1-20; Lazzarato, M., Immaterial labor (1996) Radical Thought in Italy: A Potential Politics, pp. 133-150. , Virno P., Hardt M., (eds), Minneapolis, MN, University of Minnesota Press, (Eds.), (., –; Lee, D., Papers, please: The “Boring” game that became a smash hit (2014) BBC.com, , http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-26527109, Retrieved from; Mims, C., Google’s “20% time,” which brought you Gmail and AdSense, is now as good as dead (2013) Qz.com, , http://qz.com/115831/googles-20-time-which-brought-you-gmail-and-adsense-is-now-as-good-as-dead/, Retrieved from; Morozov, E., (2012) The net delusion: The dark side of internet freedom, , New York, NY, Public Affairs Books; Kerr, A., Space wars: The politics of games production in Europe (2013) Gaming globally: Production, play and place, pp. 215-232. , Huntemann N., Aslinger B., (eds), New York, NY, Palgrave Macmillan, (Eds.), (., –; Kirkpatrick, G., (2013) Computer games and the social imaginary, , Malden, MA, Polity Press; Nealon, J., (2007) Foucault beyond Foucault: Power and its intensifications since 1984, , Palo Alto, CA, Stanford University Press; Nealon, J., (2012) Post-postmodernism: Or the cultural logic of just-in-time capitalism, , Palo Alto, CA, Stanford University Press; Nichols, R., Who plays, who pays?

It is difficult to believe, however, that it has not defined the way in which video games are perceived; the effect, it can be argued, is subtle. For the millions of Indians playing games such as Empire: Total War or East India Company, their encounter with colonial history is direct and unavoidable, especially given the pervasiveness of postcolonial reactions in everything from academia to day-to-day conversation around them. The ways in which games construct conceptions of spatiality, political systems, ethics, and society are often deeply imbued with a notion of the colonial and therefore also with the questioning of colonialism.

By 1999, however, these attempts collapsed, and video games remained a masculinized technology. To help understand why this movement failed, this article addresses the unexplored role of consumer press in defining “gamers” as male. A detailed content analysis of Nintendo Power issues published from 1994 to 1999 shows that mainstream companies largely ignored the girls’ games movement, instead targeting male audiences through player representations, sexualized female characters, magazine covers featuring men, and predominantly male authors. Given the mutually constitutive nature of representation and reality, the lack of women in consumer press then affected girls’ ability to identify as gamers and enter the gaming community. This shows that, even as gaming audiences diversify, inclusive representations are also needed to redefine gamer as more than just “male.”. © 2015, The Author(s) 2015.","consumer press; critical content analysis; gender; media history; video games",,,,,,,,,"Anderson, B., (2006) Imagined communities: Reflections on the origin and spread of nationalism, , London, England, Verso; Auerbach, D., Letter to a young male gamer (2014) Slate Magazine, , http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/bitwise/2014/08/zoe_quinn_harassment_a_letter_to_a_young_male_gamer.html, 8, 27, Retrieved from; Beasley, B., Standley, T.C., Shirts vs. skins: Clothing as an indicator of gender role stereotyping in video games (2002) Mass Communication and Society, 5, pp. 279-293; Behm-Morawitz, E., Mastro, D., The effects of the sexualization of female video game characters on gender stereotyping and female self-concept (2009) Sex Roles, 61, pp. 808-823; Bryce, J., Rutter, J., (2002) Killing like a girl: Gendered gaming and girl gamer’s visibility, , 6, 6, 8, Computer Games and Digital Cultures Conference, Tampere, Finland, (, –; Bryce, J., Rutter, J., The gendering of computer gaming: Experience and space (2003) Leisure cultures: Investigations in sport, media and technology, pp. 3-22. , Fleming S., Jones I., (eds), Great Britain, England, Leisure Cultures Association, (Eds.), (., –; Burgess, M.C.R., Stermer, S.P., Burgess, S.R., Sex, lies, and video games: The portrayal of male and female characters on video game covers (2007) Sex Roles, 57, pp. 419-433; Burrill, D.A., (2008) Die Tryin’: Videogames, masculinity, culture, , New York, NY, Peter Lang; Campbell, C., (2014) Sarkeesian driven out of home by online abuse and death threats, , http://www.polygon.com/2014/8/27/6075679/sarkeesian-driven-out-of-home-by-online-abuse-and-death-threats, 8, 27, Polygon, Retrieved from; Cassell, J., Jenkins, H., (1998) From Barbie to Mortal Kombat: Gender and computer games, , Danbury, CT, NetLibrary, (Eds; Cote, A., I can defend myself”: Women’s strategies for coping with harassment while gaming online (2015) Games and Culture; Dietz, T., An examination of violence and gender role portrayals in video games: Implications for gender socialization and aggressive behavior (1998) Sex Roles, 38, pp. 425-442; Dill, K.E., Thill, K.P., Video game characters and the socialization of gender roles: Young people’s perceptions mirror sexist media depictions (2007) Sex Roles, 57, pp. 851-864; Douglas, S.J., (1987) Inventing American broadcasting, 1899-1922, , Baltimore, MD, Johns Hopkins University Press; Downs, E., Smith, S.L., Keeping abreast of hypersexuality: A video game character content analysis (2010) Sex Roles, 62, pp. 721-733; Dyer-Witheford, N., dePeuter, G., (2009) Games of empire, , Minneapolis, University of Minnesota Press; Edidin, R., (2014) She was harassed by a games reporter.

This article examines the ways that a young gamer stitches together several different spaces to play Minecraft. Our study focuses on the play of a single participant, collecting ethnographic data about how he enacts play across several different technologies as both a player and a server administrator. We find that Skype serves as the primary technology that enables gameplay between other spaces (e.g., building a server, playing on that server, and recording gameplay to upload onto YouTube). Relatedly, Skype’s prominence as a communication technology causes some difficulties with backgrounding personal identities during gameplay. Our findings show how everyday interactions in gaming spaces are carried out across affinity spaces and the implications that networked play has for access to the learning opportunities inherent in play. © 2015, The Author(s) 2015.","affinity spaces; connective ethnography; critical game studies; Minecraft",,,,,,"National Science Foundation, NSF: 1124176","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: The Sci-Dentity project was funded by The National Science Foundation through award number 1124176.",,"Ahn, J., Subramaniam, M., Bonsignore, E., Pellicone, A., Waugh, A., Yip, J.C., I want to be a game designer or scientist”: Connected learning and developing identities with urban, African-American youth (2014) Proceedings of the Eleventh International Conference of the Learning Sciences (ICLS 2014), , In; Banks, J., Potts, J., Towards a cultural science of videogames: Evolutionary social learning (2010) Cultural Science, 3, pp. 1-17; Consalvo, M., Confronting toxic gamer culture: A challenge for feminist game studies scholars (2012) Ada: A Journal of Gender, New Media and Technology, 1. , http://adanewmedia.org/2012/11/issue1-consalvo/, 9, Retrieved from; Daniels, J., Lalone, N., Racism in video games: Connecting extremist and mainstream expressions of white supremacy (2012) Social exclusion, power and video game play: New research in digital media and technology, pp. 85-99. , Embrick D., Wright J.T., Lukács A., (eds), Chicago, IL, Lexington Books, (Eds.), (., –; Dirksen, V., Huizing, A., Smit, B., Piling on layers of understanding”: The use of connective ethnography for the study of (online) work practices (2010) New Media & Society, 12, pp. 1045-1063; Duncan, S., Kongregating online: Developing design literacies in a play-based affinity space (2012) Learning in video game affinity spaces, pp. 51-83. , Hayes E.R., Duncan S.C., (eds), New York, NY, P.

Of the 1,950 mobile players sampled, 3% (n = 58) demonstrated signs of possible pathological behavior. The nonproblematic players showed characteristics identifiable with the casual mobile game player, who plays as a quick distraction to pass time when waiting or out of boredom. By comparison, the problematic players were found to play as a means of avoiding responsibilities and as a possible distraction from pain and discomfort. The findings help substantiate claims that mobile gameplay is a casual activity at least for the majority of individuals. However, for some, mobile gaming can interfere with different aspects of life and, in worst cases, may lead to pathological dependence. © 2015, © The Author(s) 2015.","addiction; DSM; mobile games; pathological dependence; problematic play; video games",,,,,,,,,"(2014) DSM, , http://www.psych.org/practice/dsm, Retrieved from; Akl, A., Game addiction plagues Asia, grows in US (2013) Voice of America, , http://blogs.voanews.com/techtonics/2013/12/06/game-addiction-plagues-asia-grows-in-us/, Retrieved from; Apperley, T., (2010) Gaming rhythms: Play and counterplay from the situated to the global, , Amsterdam, the Netherlands, Institute of Network Cultures; Becker, D., (2002) Games junkies—Hooked on “heroinware”?

Game designers and producers spend years on plot and character development, the creation of appropriate settings, and providing the player with a ludic experience that is both enriching and perplexing. This article looks at the creation of virtual utopian societies as the basis for contemporary video games. Just as the world today sees many conflicts over island rights, island sovereignties, and, sometimes, the creation of artificial islands that seek to escape governance of existing countries, video games have embraced the creation of a separate society for settings that explore new or extreme forms of individual, societal, and political development. Examining the BioShock series, this article looks at how video games and their designers have used utopic theories of society to create new experiences, potentialities, and ethical dilemmas for the players. © 2015, © The Author(s) 2015.","Bioshock; dystopia; islands; ocean; utopia",,,,,,,,,"Aldred, J., Greenspan, B., A man chooses, a slave obeys: BioShock and the dystopian logic of convergence (2011) Games and Culture, 6, pp. 479-496; Anckar, D., Archipelagos and political engineering: The impact of non-contiguity on devolution in small states (2007) Island Studies Journal, 2, pp. 193-208; (2003) Star wars: Knights of the Old Republic, , San Francisco, CA, LucasArts; (1997) Fallout, , California, Interplay Entertainment; Bourgonjon, J., Vandermeersche, G., De Wever, B., Soetaert, R., Valcke, M., Players’ perspectives on the positive impact of video games: A qualitative content analysis of online forum discussions (2016) New Media & Society; Crecente, B., No gods or kings: objectivism in BioShock (2008) Kotaku, , http://kotaku.com/354717/no-gods-or-kings-objectivism-in-BioShock, 2, 15, Retrieved February 14, 2012, from; Defoe, D., (1994) Robinson Crusoe, , New York, NY, Norton, Original work published 1719; Depraetere, C., The challenge of nissology: A global outlook on the world archipelago part 2: The global and scientific vocation of nissology (2008) Island Studies Journal, 3, pp. 17-36. , b); El-Sabaawi, S., The girl without a land (2013) Re/Action, , http://www.reactionzine.com/the-girl-without-a-land/, 7, 24, Retrieved August 25, 2014, from; Gillis, J.R., (2004) Islands of the mind: How the human imagination created the atlantic world, , New York, NY, Palgrave Macmillan; Hall, A.C.O., I am trying to believe: Dystopia in the year zero alternate reality game (2009) Eludamos: Journal for Computer Game Culture, 3, pp. 69-82; Hay, P., A phenomenology of islands (2006) Island Studies Journal, 1, pp. 19-42; Hocking, C., Ludonarrative dissonance in bioshock (2007) Click Nothing, , http://clicknothing.typepad.com/click_nothing/2007/10/ludonarrative-d.html, 10, 7, Retrieved August 25, 2015, from; (2013) BioShock Infinite, , Novato, CA, 2K Games; Jackson, R., (2014) BioShock: Decision, forced choice and propaganda, , Croydon, England, Zero Books; Johnson, D.S., (1994) Phantom islands of the Atlantic, , New York, NY, Walker and Co; Lizardi, R., BioShock: Complex and alternate histories (2014) Game Studies, 14, pp. 1-13; (1994) System shock, , Austin, TX, Origin Systems; Lowenthal, D., Islands, lovers, and others (2007) The Geographical Review, 97, pp. 202-229; Mieville, C., Floating utopias (2008) Evil paradises: Dreamworlds of neoliberalism, pp. 251-261. , Davis M., Monk D.D., (eds), New York, NY, New Press, In, (Eds.); More, T., (2003) Utopia, , London, England, Penguin, Original work published 1516; Nyman, E., The island as container: Islands, archipelagos, and player movement in video games (2013) Island Studies Journal, 8, pp. 269-284; Olwig, K.R., Are islands insular?

Yet small-group games online can affect the social networks that spill into civic life (and vice versa). This study examined players of the world’s most popular personal computer game, League of Legends. Such games are theorized as mirrors that reflect civic tendencies and help some players to retain social resources. Using models of civic voluntarism, the attitudes and behaviors of more than 9,000 gamers were investigated. Gamers were shown to have relatively typical civic lives, except for unusually high rates of peaceful protest. Which gamers protest? As predicted, models for protest improved when considering how players approach their gaming (including recruiting and collaboration preferences). Dispelling some civic fears, there was no evidence that video games distracted from civic life when played in moderation. The findings support an emerging notion of protest as a playful and “expressive” civic mode. © 2015, © The Author(s) 2015.","activism; civic engagement; civic voluntarism; e-sports; game; gamers; MOBA; politics; protest; role-play; small group; social capital; time",,,,,,,,,"Adachi, P.J.C., Willoughby, T., From the couch to the sports field: The longitudinal associations between sports video game play, self-esteem, and involvement in sports (2015) Psychology of Popular Media Culture, 4, pp. 329-341; Bandura, A., (1997) Self-efficacy: The exercise of control, , New York, NY, Worth; Bekkers, R., (2007) Values and volunteering: A longitudinal study of reciprocal influences in the giving in the Netherlands panel study, , Paper presented at the 36th ARNOVA Conference, Atlanta, GA; Bennett, W.L., Wells, C., Rank, A., Young citizens and civic learning: Two paradigms of citizenship in the digital age (2009) Citizenship Studies, 13, pp. 105-120; Castronova, E., Williams, D., Shen, C., Ratan, R., Xiong, L., Huang, Y., Keegan, B., As real as real?

We used a novel method—the Prison Tycoon computer game—to explore participants’ attitudes toward rehabilitation and punishment. Forty-two men and 48 women were asked to construct a virtual prison equipped with rehabilitation, correction, and neutral facilities. Financial investment spent on each respective type of facility was treated as an indicator of a participant’s particular attitudes toward punishment. Additionally, participants completed the NEO Five-Factor Personality Inventory. Results indicated that Neuroticism and Openness to experience may be reliable predictors of one’s willingness to rehabilitate prisoners (measured as the amount of money spent on rehabilitation/correction facilities). This novel experimental method sheds new light on the issue of reliably and ecologically measuring attitudes in the lab and provides further evidence that computer games offer a new, effective alternative to classical research methods in this area. © 2015, © The Author(s) 2015.","computer games; correctional attitudes; personality; prison; punitive attitudes",,,,,,,"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: The research was supported by funds of Polish Ministry of Science and Higher Education (scholarships to P.S. for years 2012–2017 and scholarship to A.S. for years 2013–2016), and Polish National Science Centre (ETIUDA scholarship #2013/08/T/HS6/00408 to A.S.) and The European Social Fund (European Union Operational Programme Human Capital) scholarship to A.O.

While platform studies has its critics, who primarily lament the limitations of the project, a recent spate of publications in the field suggests considerable dynamism in platform studies as the concept is further developed. This article argues that by examining platform studies from the perspective of media archaeology, it becomes apparent that platform studies establishes an “epistemic threshold”. Additionally, platform studies is a historical method which both establish continuities and mark breaks with previous platforms and technologies. From the perspective of this threshold, this article explores epistemic questions that arise from how platform studies forms an archive, and how media archaeology can enrich the method’s explicit concerns and engagements with technology and culture. © 2015, © The Author(s) 2015.","archive; critical practice; game studies; media archaeology; platform studies; Zielinski",,,,,,"University of New South Wales, UNSW

Participants maintain a sense of freedom and spontaneity while acting within situational constraints—ethical expectations, preexplicated rules, implicit rules, and complex negotiations that occur during the play itself either openly or more subtly. Because it has implications for the participants’ everyday lives, lifestyle group sex is a phenomenon on the border between games and adult play. Through an analysis of the rules and social contracts arising in group sex, we demonstrate how participants learn to read interactions at group sex events in the way that players learn game systems and how they can and do become “good players” in such situations. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.","adult play; group sex; rules; sex as play; social negotiation; swinging",,,,,,,,,"Agar, M., (1996) The professional stranger: An informal introduction to fieldwork, , New York, NY, Academic Press; Alexander, M.G., Fisher, T.D., Truth and consequences: Using the bogus pipeline to examine sex differences in self-reported sexuality (2003) Journal of Sex Research, 40, pp. 27-35; Apter, M.J., A structural-phenomenology of play (1991) Adult play: A reversal theory approach, pp. 13-42. , Kerr J.H., Apter M.J., (eds), Amsterdam, the Netherlands, Swets & Zeitlinger, In, (Eds.); Bain, A.L., Nash, C.J., Undressing the researcher: Feminism, embodiment and sexuality at a queer bathhouse event (2006) Area, 38, pp. 99-106; Bateson, G., A theory of play and fantasy (1955) Steps to an ecology of mind, pp. 177-193. , Bateson G., (ed), Chicago, IL, Chicago University Press, 2000, (, /,)., In, (Ed.); Becker, H.S., (1963) Outsiders: Studies in the sociology of deviance, , New York, NY, MacMillan; Bentzen, A.-S., Træen, B., Swinging in Norway in the context of sexual health (2014) Sexuality & Culture, 18, pp. 132-148; Bergstrand, C., Sinski, J.B., (2010) Swinging in America: Love, sex, and marriage in the 21st century, , Santa Barbara, CA, Praeger; Boelstorff, T., Nardi, B., Pearce, C., Taylor, T.L., (2012) Ethnography and virtual worlds: A handbook of method, , Princeton, NJ, Princeton University Press; Bogost, I., (2007) Persuasive games: The expressive power of videogames, , Cambridge, MA, The MIT Press; Bolton, R., Tricks, friends, and lovers: Erotic encounters in the field (1995) Taboo: Sex, identity and erotic subjectivity in anthropological fieldwork, pp. 140-167. , Kulick D., Willson M., (eds), London, England, Routledge, In, (Eds.); Bolton, R., Mapping terra incognita: Sex research for AIDS prevention—An urgent agenda for the 1990s (2002) Sexualities: Critical concepts in sociology, pp. 142-173. , Plummer K., (ed), London, England, Routledge, In, (Ed.); Brame, G., Brame, W.D., Jacobs, J., (1997) Different loving: The world of sexual dominance & submission, , London, England, Century; Brodsky, J.I., The Mineshaft: A retrospective ethnography (1993) Journal of Homosexuality, 24, pp. 233-251; Brown, A.M.L., (2015) Sexuality in role-playing games, , New York, NY, Taylor & Francis; Buytendijk, F.J.J., (1931) Het spel van mensch en dier als openbaring van levensdriften, , Amsterdam, the Netherlands, Kosmos; Caillois, R., (1961) Man, play, and games, , New York, NY, The Free Press of Glencoe; Castronova, E., (2005) Synthetic worlds: The business and culture of online games, , Chicago, IL, University of Chicago Press; de Visser, R.O., McDonald, D., Swings and roundabouts: Management of jealousy in heterosexual ‘swinging’ couples (2007) British Journal of Social Psychology, 46, pp. 459-476; DeKoven, B., (2013) The well-played game.

When serious hobby board gamers become parents, their opportunities for engaging in the pastime are constrained by their new family responsibilities. Based on an ethnographic study of serious hobby board gamers, we investigate how play is constrained by parenting and how serious board gamers with these responsibilities create opportunities to continue to play board games by negotiating the context, time, location, and medium of play.

To be “caught” playing as an adult therefore risks embarrassment. Still, many designers want to create enjoyable, nonembarrassing play experiences for adults. To address this need, this article reads instances of spontaneous adult play through the lens of Erving Goffman’s theory of the interaction order to unpack conditions and strategies for nonembarrassing adult play. It identifies established frames, segregated audiences, scripts supporting smooth performance, managing audience awareness, role distancing, and, particularly, alibis for play: Adults routinely provide alternative, adult-appropriate motives to account for their play, such as child care, professional duties, creative expression, or health. Once legitimized, the norms and rules of play themselves then provide an alibi for behavior that would risk being embarrassing outside play. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.","accounts; adult play; adulthood; alibi; embarrassment; Erving Goffman; frame analysis; motivational accounting system; role distance",,,,,,"EP/M023265/1","The author(s) received financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was conducted in the Digital Creativity Labs (digitalcreativity.ac.uk), jointly funded by EPSRC/AHRC/InnovateUK under grant no EP/M023265/1.",,"Arnett, J.J., Learning to stand alone: The contemporary American transition to adulthood in cultural and historical context (1998) Human Development, 41, pp. 295-315; Arnett, J.J., Conceptions of the transition to adulthood: Perspectives from adolescence through midlife (2001) Journal of Adult Development, 8, pp. 133-143; Arnett, J.J., Emerging adulthood: What is it, and what is it good for?

The rhetoric of play theorists is mirrored against the rhetoric of organized players (hobbyists) and (nonorganized) everyday players through in-depth interviews and participatory observation. Questions guiding the exploratory path this article takes include the following: First, what has led to the dominant ideas of the toy as a collectable item and of adult toy consumers as toy collectors? Second, why is the manipulation of toys that happens at adult age considered hobbying and not playing? The results of the analysis indicate that the uses of toys at adult age represent more complex and multifaceted actions and relationships to play than the terms “collecting” and “hobbying” imply. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.","adult play; collectors; hobby(ing); play(fulness); toys",,,,,,"Academy of Finland

This article pushes the limits of game scholars’ lusory attitude by breaching an academic seminar with a playful experiment. Five MurMur Moderator seats, interactive and interruptive furniture prototypes, were set up at a game research seminar where they were used as ambient elements during the presentations. The experience was evaluated by observation, accompanied with seminar tweets, and by conducting a small survey after the seminar. The experiences of the participants varied from enthusiastically positive to strong negative feelings. Through this experiment, we were able to explore the important issue of polarized attitudes of adults toward play and provide some food for thought for the future design of adult play. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.","adult play; ambient play; auditive play; breaching experiment; conference games; playful furniture",,,,,,,,,"Arrasvuori, J., Boberg, M., Holopainen, J., Korhonen, H., Lucero, A., Montola, M., (2011) Applying the PLEX framework in designing for playfulness, p. 24. , Deserti A., Zo F., (eds), Proceedings of the 2011 Conference on Designing Pleasurable Products and Interfaces, Milano, Italy, ACM, New York, In, (Eds.), p; Castronova, E., Down with dullness: Gaming the Academic Conference (2013) Information Society, 29, pp. 66-70; Coulton, P., Playful and gameful design for the internet of things (2015) More playful user interfaces, pp. 151-173. , Nijholt A., (ed), Singapore, Springer, In, (Ed.); Deterding, S., The ambiguity of games.

Investigated here are questions on how bodies navigate local terrain through the practice of running, and how running bodies are made visible as networked and gendered agents moving in their public space. It is a qualitative study of networked movement, a feel of running, where the footwork of women in particular is located. To consider such textures of movement, this research works from a phenomenologically inspired sociology of running with a specific playful app in hand, Zombies, Run! This work suggests how playfulness tied to the very basic action of forward movement can cultivate new understandings of being in the world through other kinds of running body practices, prompting new attentions to movement, public space, and one’s position and mobility within it as a gendered body on the run. © 2015, © The Author(s) 2015.","embodiment; Instagram; Run!; running; women; Zombies",,,,,,,,,"Allen-Collinson, J., Running embodiment, power and vulnerability: Notes towards a feminist phenomenology of female running (2010) Women and exercise: The body, health and consumerism, pp. 280-298. , Keny E., Markula P., (eds), London, England, Routledge,.

Over time, Blizzard Entertainment’s approach to multiplayer activities in WoW has changed. During the past decade, in-game world events, group matchmaking systems, and phasing technologies have been used to increasingly emphasize individual achievement rather than collaborative effort. The game is shifting away from sociable activities in favor of ones that situate players as powerful, atomized characters. WoW’s governmentality now encourages players to see each other as obstacles to success and to see themselves as entrepreneurial subjects. These neoliberal strategies have the potential to impact our ability to collectively imagine and create alternative forms of social interaction and organization. © 2015, © The Author(s) 2015.","game design; governmentality; MMOGs; sociability; World of Warcraft",,,,,,,,,"(2011) The decline of WoW server communities, , http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/2301632141, 3, 27, [Discussion].

Kennedy in 1963, and it has been remediated from historical anxieties about execution and brain death to the eye-popping spectacle of the exploding head to video games, where it has entered a regime that holds virtuosic reflexes as the highest form of capital. By examining the textual and technological history of the headshot, this article develops a theory of mechropolitics: a way of thinking about political death worlds as they operate in the mechanics of video games and digital simulations. Moving beyond questions of whether violence in video games has a direct effect on aggression, mechropolitics mobilizes aesthetic and social justice critique to unmask the affective structures operating within digital death worlds. These prioritize twitch reflexes and offer few consequences—precisely the scenarios that render events like police shootings both legible and likely. © 2015, © The Author(s) 2015.","death; headshot; mechanics; police brutality; race",,,,,,"Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada, SSHRC

Yet games and military simulations are used by military organizations across the world to teach the modern arts of war, from how to shoot a gun to teamwork, leadership skills, military values, and cultural sensitivity. We survey a number of ways of reconciling these apparently contradictory claims and argue that none of them are ultimately successful. Thus, either military organizations are wrong to think that games and simulations have a useful role to play in training anything other than the most narrowly circumscribed physical skills or some recreational digital games do, in fact, have the power to influence the real-world behavior and dispositions of players in morally significant ways. © 2015, © The Author(s) 2015.","computer games; ethics; military simulations; video games; violence",,,,,,,,,"(2014) Tactical Iraqi language & culture training system, , http://www.alelo.com/case-study/tactical-iraqi-language-culture-training-system/, Retrieved September 20, 2014, from; Anderson, C.A., An update on the effects of violent digital games (2004) Journal of Adolescence, 27, pp. 113-122; Anderson, C.A., Carnagey, N.L., Flanagan, M., Benjamin, A.J., Eubanks, J., Valentine, J.C., Violent digital games: Specific effects of violent content on aggressive thoughts and behavior (2004) Advances in Experimental Social Psychology, 36, pp. 200-251; Anderson, C.A., Sakamoto, A., Gentile, D.A., Ihori, N., Shibuya, A., Yukawa, S., Kobayashi, K., Longitudinal effects of violent video games on aggression in Japan and the United States (2008) Pediatrics, 122, pp. 1067-1072; Anderson, C.A., Shibuya, A., Ihori, N., Swing, E.L., Bushman, B.J., Sakamoto, A., Saleem, M., Violent video game effects on aggression, empathy, and prosocial behavior in eastern and western countries: A meta-analytic review (2010) Psychological Bulletin, 136, pp. 151-173; Annas, J., (2011) Intelligent virtue, , Oxford, England, Oxford University Press; Aristotle, (1980) The Nicomachean ethics, , Oxford, England, Oxford University Press, Trans.); Bogost, I., (2006) Unit operations: An approach to videogame criticism, , Cambridge, MIT Press; (2007) Virtual Battlespace 2, , Nelson Bay, Australia, Bohemia Interactive Simulations; Bourge, C., McGonigle, D., From gaming to training (2006) Military Training Technology, 11, pp. 6-9; Brenick, A., Henning, A., Killen, M., O’Connor, A., Collins, M., Social evaluations of stereotypic images in video games: Unfair, legitimate, or “just entertainment”?

We use data-driven modeling that distils genres from textual descriptions of a large collection of games. We analyze the evolution of game genres from 1979 till 2010. Our results indicate that until 1990, there have been many genres competing for dominance, but thereafter sport-racing, strategy, and action have become the most prevalent genres. Moreover, we find that games vary to a great extent as to whether they belong mostly to one genre or to a combination of several genres. We also compare the results of our data-driven model with two product databases, Metacritic and Mobygames, and observe that the classifications of games to different genres are substantially different, even between product databases. We conclude with discussion on potential future applications and how they may further our understanding of video game genres. © 2015, © The Author(s) 2015.","data-driven modeling; game corpus; game genre; Metacritic; Mobygames; quantitative; topic model",,,,,,"Academy of Finland: 137808

Through the prominent placement of visual representations of renewable power generation the game offers a compelling vision of the future in which current resistance to low-carbon and renewable economies have been overcome. I argue that the potential of this vision to challenge cultural futures and imaginaries is dependent on its presentation aesthetically and not, as is often suggested, on game mechanics operating in a “persuasive” mode. Instead, I argue that ARMA 3’s aesthetic vision can skirt around the ideological resistances players may have against accepting more didactic modes of engagement with the highly charged and ideologically contested reality of anthropogenic climate change. In this way, I suggest ARMA 3 offers a compelling challenge to current theories about games ability to persuade or influence players. © 2015, © The Author(s) 2015.","climate change; game design; ideology; persuasive games; video game aesthetics",,,,,,,,,"Barton, M., How’s the weather: Simulating weather in virtual environments (2008) Game Studies, 8. , http://gamestudies.org/0801/articles/barton, Retrieved from; Bell-Gawne, K., Meaningful play: The Intersection of videogames and environmental policy (2013) Proceedings of Games, Learning and Society Conference 9.0, , Williams Caroline C., Ochsner, Dietmeier, Steinkuehler, (eds), 6, 12–14, Madison, Wisconsin,.

The player is not granted an avatar in the world, but this does not mean the player is granted the role of a transcendent deity either. Instead, the player operates on the relational level—completely managing all economic interactions and assigning social codes to different spaces. Lacking a “win” condition, players are free to engage with the game however they wish, including allowing for the immediate and unsympathetic demise of the community. As play continues, Dwarf Fortress ceases to be a fortress and becomes what the autonomists describe as a “laboratory.” The social relations of the fortress are upturned and become the site for experiments in production. The fortress too becomes the site for thought experiments on alternative economies, containing not one but many social laboratories. © 2015, © The Author(s) 2015.","Aristotle; autonomist Marxism; Dwarf Fortress; economic laboratory; experimental economies; homestead games; open games; postMarxism; strategy games; video game economies",,,,,,"Australian Research Council","Robbie Fordyce is a research fellow for the Melbourne Network Society Institute at the University of Melbourne as well as for the Australian Communications Consumer Action Network, specializing in social research into 3-D printing.

It also theorizes a strategy for player involvement based on “distanced” (self-reflexive and meta) engagement. Through an examination of the narrative, characters, and gameplay, supplemented with national fertility survey data from Japan, the article argues that Catherine subverts classic game tropes and fosters player engagement with a socially relevant diegesis. Simultaneously, the unique meta-gameplay elements utilize what I term “distanced engagement” to encourage the player to critically self-reflect on both the game scenario and their role as a player. In this way, the article considers how the unique relationship between story and distanced engagement allows video games like Catherine to function as impactful and interactive social narratives. © 2015, © The Author(s) 2015.","affect; Atlus; Catherine; childbirth; distance; distanced engagement; empathy; engagement; Japan; Japanese; population; RPG; self-reflexivity; social narrative; video game",,,,,,,,,"(2007) Bioshock [Xbox 360 video game], , New York, NY, 2K Games; Ash, J., Attention, videogames and the retentional economies of affective amplification (2012) Theory, Culture & Society, 29, pp. 3-26; Ash, J., Technologies of captivation: Videogames and the attunement of affect (2013) Body & Society, 19, pp. 27-51; (2011) Catherine, , PlayStation 3 video game, Irvine, CA, Index Digital Media; Azuma, H., (2007) Gēmuteki riarizumu no tanjō: Dōbutsuka suru posutomodan 2 [The birth of gamic realism: The animalizing postmodern 2], , Tokyo, Japan, Kōdansha Gendai Shinsho; Azuma, H., (2009) Otaku: Japan’s database animals, , Minneapolis, University of Minnesota Press, Trans.); Bogost, I., (2006) Unit operations: An approach to videogame criticism, , Cambridge, MA, The MIT Press; Bogost, I., (2007) Persuasive games: The expressive power of videogames, , Cambridge, MA, The MIT Press; Bogost, I., (2011) How to do things with videogames, , Minneapolis, MN, University of Minnesota Press; Bogost, I., Ferrari, S., Schweizer, B., (2010) Newsgames: Journalism at play, , Cambridge, MA, The MIT Press; Chen, S., The rise of soushokukei danshi masculinity and consumption in contemporary Japan (2012) Gender, culture, and consumer behavior, pp. 285-310. , Otnes, Zayer, (eds), New York, NY, Routledge,.

We adopted a netnographic approach to studying the culture of transient Internet communities shaping the player off-line communities. Fieldwork was conducted over the entire life span of the game (3 years). Data were analyzed using a qualitative thematic approach and the software EdEt. The results describe the evolution of the gaming experience through online interaction and its importance in everyday off-line life. Players were observed to play an important role in the production of social meanings associated with gaming and with the gaming community online and off-line.

This study explores the use of the Social Presence module of the Games Experience Questionnaire to measure user experience in a multiplayer board game involving 12 participants across 3 separate sessions. Scale analysis and correlation with semistructured interviews held with the participants suggest that the instrument is reliable and valid and can thus be used for measurement and comparison of user experience across game formats. The Games Experience Questionnaire can therefore be used to scale-up board game research by diminishing reliance on interviews as well as to assist in the choice between digital and nondigital implementation of gameplay forming part of an overarching story, such as in transmedial productions. © 2015, © The Author(s) 2015.","board games; multiplayer; narrative interviews; transmedia storytelling; user experience",,,,,,,,,"(2004) I Love Bees, , Burbank, CA, 42 Entertainment; (2007) Why So Serious?, , Burbank, CA, 42 Entertainment; Bach, C., Gauducheau, N., Salembier, P., Combining interviews and scales in the multidimensional evaluation of user experience: A case study in 3D games (2011) Proceedings of the 29th Annual European Conference on Cognitive Ergonomics, pp. 157-160. , Dittmar, Forbrig, (eds), Rostock, Germany, ACM,.

To gain understanding of how such social structures operate, this project observes speeches made by heads of organizations in EVE Online to determine the categorization tools used to maintain order in a potentially chaotic environment. It finds that by focusing on group identity, leaders emphasize their role and responsibility for creating and maintaining organizational culture. Additionally, by crafting a narrative of territorial conflict and their own role as a warlord and military leader, they encourage ruthlessness on the part of their membership and establish a social system based upon the individual leader. © 2015, © The Author(s) 2015.","ethnomethodology; identity; massively multiplayer online games; online interaction; social control",,,,,,,,,"Austin, J.L., (1962) Sense and sensibilia, , Warrik, (ed), Oxford, England, Clarendon Press, (Ed.); Barnett, J., Coulson, M., Virtually real: A psychological perspective on massively multiplayer online games (2010) Review of General Psychology, 14, pp. 167-179; Beneito-Montagut, R., Ethnography goes online, towards a user-centered methodology to research interpersonal communication on the Internet (2011) Qualitative Research, 6, pp. 716-735; Bennerstedt, U., Sheeping, sapping and avatars-in-action: An in-screen perspective on online gameplay (2008) The [player] conference, pp. 28-52. , IT University of Copenhagen, Denmark, Copenhagen, (; Bergstrom, K., Virtual inequality: A woman’s place in cyberspace (2012) FDG ‘12, , 5, 29, 6, 1, Raleigh, NC, USA; Bergstrom, K., Carter, M., Woodford, D., Paul, C., Constructing the ideal EVE online player (2013) DiGRA, , Atlanta, GA, 2013; Boellstorff, T., (2008) Coming of age in second life, , Princeton, NJ, Princeton University Press; Boellstorff, T., Nardi, B.A., Pearce, C., Taylor, T.L., (2012) Ethnography and virtual worlds: A handbook of method, , Princeton, NJ, Princeton University Press; Burke, P., Stets, J., (2009) Identity theory, , New York, NY, Oxford University Press; Butler, B., Sproull, L., Kiesler, S., Kraut, R., Community effort in online groups: Who does the work and why?

Focalization is shown to have a hybrid form in games. This article also explores the different types of narrators and granularities in games, and how these three concepts can be used to create meaning-effects.

By doing so enters his work into a critique process that, according to James Elkins, dates back to the Romantic period in which artists are evaluated by peers on an individualized basis according to the ideals and creative direction they produce in the form of written and verbal artifacts. Arthur Danto calls these artifacts “artistic identification” in his essay, “The Artworld,” written in 1964. The study applies this critique method to Rohrer’s work in the game medium and asks how it fares when subjected to what Howard Becker calls, “a continuous process of selection” through critique.

In this article, I argue that one unique way games as a medium can participate in constructing cultural memory is by simulating historically situated structural metaphors. To do so, I first introduce the concept of cultural memory and link it to material culture studies. I argue that games can be cultural memory “objectivations,” but in order to fully analyze them in this respect insights from game studies, namely, the meaning potential of rules, need to be applied as well. I then discuss how three board games, 1830: Railways and Robber Barons, Age of Steam, and Empire Builder simulate the structural metaphors identified by Wolfgang Schivelbusch that were used by contemporary observers to understand the experiential changes wrought by the railroad. I close by arguing that this type of research is valuable in that it opens up new understandings of how games influence the way a culture thinks about and remembers its past. © 2015, © The Author(s) 2015.","board games; cultural memory; material culture; metaphor; simulation",,,,,,,,,"Aarseth, E., (2003) Playing research: Methodological approaches to game analysis, , Proceedings of the Digital Arts and Culture Conference, Melbourne; Assman, J., Excerpt from Moses the Egyptian: The Memory of Egypt in Western Monotheism (2011) The Collective Memory Reader, pp. 209-215. , Olick, Vinitzky-Seroussi, Levy, (eds), New York, NY, Oxford University Press,.

It relies on a sociology of science perspective to answer the question: What are game studies really about? Relying on scientometric and lexicometric tools, we analyze the metadata and content of a corpus of articles from the journals Games Studies and Games & Culture and of Digital Games Research Association (DiGRA) proceedings. We show that published researches have been studying only a limited set of game genres and that they especially focus on online games. We then expose the different ways game studies are talking about games through a topic model analysis of our corpus. We test two hypotheses to explain the concentration of research on singular objects: path dependence and trading zone. We describe integrative properties of the focus on common objects but stress also the scientific limits met by this tendency. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.","epistemic culture; game studies; interdisciplinarity; lexicometric analysis; multidisciplinarity; path dependence; sociology of science; topic modeling; trading zone; World of Warcraft (WoW)",,,,,,,,,"Aarseth, E., Computer game studies, year one (editorial) (2001) Game Studies, 1. , http://gamestudies.org/0101/editorial.html, Retrieved from,.

In response, this article reads scientometric data and game studies editorials, handbooks, and introductions through the lens of interdisciplinarity studies to assess game studies’ status as an interdiscipline. It argues that game studies show drivers and hurdles typical for interdisciplines. Yet instead of establishing themselves as the broad umbrella interdiscipline of digital game research, they are becoming one narrow cultural studies multidiscipline within the growing and diversifying field of game research and education. Researchers from fields like human–computer interaction or communication are abandoning game studies venues in favor of disciplinary ones—ironically thanks to game studies legitimizing game research. This article suggests that a design orientation and cross-disciplinary boundary objects such as middle range theories could help to broaden, deepen, and secure future interdisciplinary game research. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.","design studies; game research; game studies; interdisciplinarity; interdisciplinarity studies; multidisciplinarity; transdisciplinarity",,,,,,,,,"Aarseth, E.J., (1997) Cybertext: Perspectives on ergodic literature, , Baltimore, London, John Hopkins University Press; Aarseth, E., Computer game studies, year one (2001) Game Studies, 1. , http://www.gamestudies.org/0101/editorial.html, Retrieved from; Aarseth, E., I fought the law: Transgressive play and the implied player (2007) Situated play, proceedings of DiGRA 2007 conference, pp. 130-133. , http://www.digra.org/dl/db/07313.03489.pdf, Tokyo, Japan, DiGRA, Retrieved from,.

This can be done without leaving an object-oriented approach, thanks to the efforts of social ontology, a recent philosophical discipline that investigates social facts. The integration of social ontology into the research on games will be displayed through some mind experiments on the nature of the paradigmatic example of rules. The result of this integration leads to give up the reductionism shared by the majority of game scholars. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.","game studies; intentionality; play; rules; social ontology",,,,,,,,,"Aarseth, E., Ontology (2014) The Routledge companion to video game studies, pp. 484-492. , Wolf, Perron, (eds), New York, NY, Routledge,.

This article analyzes play in League of Legends through the lens of a binary model of expertise, outlining examples of the in-game and out-of-game practices used by players in their pursuit of competitive success.

Hygge relates to notions of home, family, safety, and security in small, sheltered surroundings, while Janteloven is a subversive attempt to codify the unwritten rules that enforce equality (or mediocrity) in Scandinavian societies. Off-line, Hygge exists in physical environments where a safe, social atmosphere can be created, similar to sociability in physical third places. In the online setting, we identify the social construction of shared interpersonal spaces where Hygge is achieved and regulated through perceived fairness with respect to constitutive and regulative rules. A sense of belonging moderates players’ behaviors toward others and even their achievements in the game to maintain harmony. The article offers a unique examination of social constructs online, contributing to the knowledge of Danish culture and of how local cultures shape online behaviors. © 2015, © The Author(s) 2015.","casual games; Hygge; Jante; social games; third places",,,,,,,,,"Avant, G.R., Knutsen, K.P., Understanding cultural differences: Janteloven and social conformity in Norway (1993) Et Cetera: A Review of General Semantics, 50, pp. 449-460; Bartle, R.A., (2004) Designing virtual worlds, , Berkeley, CA, New Riders; Barwick, J., Dearnley, J., Muir, A., Playing games with heritage: A comparative case study analysis of the current status of digital game preservation (2011) Games and Culture, 6, pp. 373-390; Brun, J., Safaei, F., Boustead, P., (2006) Fairness and playability in online multiplayer games, 2, pp. 1199-1203. , Paper presented at 3rd IEEE Consumer Communications and Networking Conference (CCNC 2006),.,; Caillois, R., (1961) Man, play, and games, , Urbana, University of Illinois Press; Campbell, A., The search for authenticity: An exploration of an online skinhead newsgroup (2006) New Media and Society, 8, pp. 269-294; Chesney, T., Coyne, I., Logan, B., Madden, N., Griefing in virtual worlds: causes, casualties and coping strategies (2009) Information Systems Journal, 19, pp. 525-548; De Schutter, B., Never too old to play: the appeal of digital games to an older audience (2011) Games and Culture, 6, pp. 155-170; Ducheneaut, N., Moore, R.J., Nickell, E., Virtual “third places”: A case study of sociability in massively multiplayer games (2007) Computer Supported Cooperative Work, 16, pp. 129-166; Eklund, L., Bridging the online/offline divide: The example of digital gaming (2015) Computers in Human Behavior, 53, pp. 527-535; Eggen, E., (1981) Espen Arnakke og hans verden, , Oslo, Norway, Aschehoug; Foo, C.Y., Koivisto, E.M., Defining grief play in MMORPGs: Player and developer perceptions (2004) Proceedings of the 2004 ACM SIGCHI International Conference on Advances in computer entertainment technology, pp. 245-250. , http://portalparts.acm.org/1070000/1067343/fm/frontmatter.pdf, New York, NY, Association for Computer Machinery,,.

We used an online survey to examine the prevalence and types of cyberbullying in MMOG play and group differences in bullying behavior. Since most MMOGs are violent and research indicates that electronic mediums have high rates of bullying, we predicted that cyberbullying would be common in MMOG play. The participants (N = 151)—a sample of self-selected MMOG players—frequently reported being cyber-victimized (52%) and engaging in cyberbullying (35%) during MMOG play. Rank was the most common motive for cyberbullying. We found that (a) males perpetrate more cyberbullying in MMOGs than females do; (b) heterosexuals perpetrate bullying at higher rates than lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) participants do; (c) female and LGBT participants experienced significantly higher rates of sexually related cyber-victimization; and (d) opponents are bullied more than teammates. Rates of victimization and perpetration overlapped substantially. © 2015, © The Author(s) 2015.","cyber-victimization; cyberbullying; gender differences; online gaming; video games",,,,,,,,,"(2013) Call of Duty series, , [video game], Santa Monica, CA, Author, (Original work published 2005); Adachi, P.C., Willoughby, T., The effect of video game competition and violence on aggressive behavior: Which characteristic has the greatest influence?

We identify and discuss various purposes of genre relating to video games, including identity, collocation and retrieval, commercial marketing, and educational instruction. Through the use of examples, we discuss the ways in which these purposes are supported by genre classification and conceptualization and the implications for video games. Suggestions for improved conceptualizations such as family resemblances, prototype theory, faceted classification, and appeal factors for video game genres are considered, with discussions of strengths and weaknesses. This analysis helps inform potential future practical applications for describing video games at cultural heritage institutions such as libraries, museums, and archives, as well as furthering the understanding of video game genre and genre classification for game studies at large. © 2015, © The Author(s) 2015.","classification; genre history; genre theory; information systems; video games",,,,,,,,,"Aarseth, E., Smedstad, S.M., Sunnanå, L., (2003) A multi-dimensional typology of games, , http://www.digra.org/digital-library/publications/a-multidimensional-typology-of-games/, DiGRA ‘03—Proceedings of the 2003 DiGRA International Conference: Level Up, Retrieved from; Aucouturier, J.-J., Pachet, F., Representing musical genre: A state of the art (2003) Journal of New Music Research, 32, pp. 83-93; Anthropy, A., Clark, N., (2014) A game design vocabulary: Exploring the foundational principles behind good game design, , Uer Saddle River, NJ, Addison-Wesley Professional; Apperley, T.H., Genre and game studies: Toward a critical approach to video game genres (2006) Simulation & Gaming, 37, pp. 6-23; Askehave, I., Swales, J.M., Genre identification and communicative purpose: A problem and a possible solution (2001) Applied Linguistics, 22, pp. 195-212; Austin, B., Gordon, T., Movie genres: Toward a conceptualized model and standard definitions (1987) Current research in film: Audiences, economics and law, 3, pp. 12-33. , Austin, (ed), Norwood, NJ, Ablex,.

Teams investigated the effects of a number of game mechanics (e.g., reward, feedback) on learning outcomes. Game designs were iterated over multiple development cycles, informed by the results of both playtesting and formal experiments. The research showed that it is possible to reduce biased decision-making both immediately and long term. The remaining articles in this special issue will describe the details of the games and the experiments, the independent validation that was done of the research, and the lessons learned. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.","cognitive biases; educational games; game design; game efficacy; serious games",,,,,,,,,"Glass, B.D., Maddox, W.T., Love, B.C., Real-time strategy game training: Emergence of a cognitive flexibility trait (2013) PLOS One, 8, p. e70350; Hanus, M.D., Fox, J., Assessing the effects of gamification in the classroom: A longitudinal study on intrinsic motivation, social comparison, satisfaction, effort, and academic performance (2015) Computers & Education, 80, pp. 152-161; Kahneman, D., (2011) Thinking, fast and slow, , New York, NY, Farrer, Straus and Giroux; Karpicke, J.D., Roediger, H.L., Repeated retrieval during learning is the key to long-term retention (2007) Journal of Memory and Language, 57, pp. 151-162; Shute, V.J., Ventura, M., Ke, F., The power of play: The effects of Portal 2 and Lumosity on cognitive and non-cognitive skills (2015) Computers and Education, 80, pp. 58-67","Bush, R.M.; Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity\, IARPA/MS2 Building, United States; email: rita.bush@iarpa.gov",,,"SAGE Publications Inc.",,,,,15554120,,,,"English","Games Cult.",Editorial,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85018769928

In our development process, we found a tension between rich and flexible experimentation and exploration experiences and robust learning experiences that ensured the lesson content was easily understood and recalled. In line with game-based learning research, initial designs were oriented toward exploration and discovery. Analyses of interviews, playtesting, logs, and surveys revealed that many players were frustrated or confused by the interface and content of the more complex games, even when consistent differences between levels of visual detail or narrative complexity were not present. We conclude that teaching complex topics such as cognitive biases to the widest range of learners required reducing the games’ playful and exploratory elements and balancing formal training content with simpler visuals and text. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.","challenge; educational games; engagement; multimedia learning",,,,,,,,,"Ajzen, I., Intuitive theories of events and the effects of base-rate information on prediction (1977) Personality and Social Psychology, 35, pp. 303-314; Aldrich, C., (2005) Learning by doing: A comprehensive guide to simulations, computer games, and pedagogy in e-learning and other educational experiences, , San Francisco, CA, Pfeiffer; Bailenson, J.N., Yee, N., Merget, D., Schroeder, R., The effect of behavioral realism and form realism of real-time avatar faces on verbal disclosure, nonverbal disclosure, emotion recognition, and co-presence in dyadic interaction (2006) Presence: Teleoperators and Virtual Environments, 15, pp. 359-372; Ball, D., Bass, H., Bridging practices: Intertwining content and pedagogy in teaching and learning to teach (2000) Journal of Teacher Education, 51, pp. 241-247; Butler, A.C., Godbole, N., Marsh, E.J., Explanation feedback is better than correct answer feedback for promoting transfer of learning (2013) Journal of Educational Psychology, 105, pp. 290-298; Clark, K., Fleck, M.S., Mitroff, S.R., Enhanced change detection performance reveals improved strategy use in avid action video game players (2011) Acta Psychologica, 136, pp. 67-72; Clegg, B.A., Martey, R.M., Stromer-Galley, J., Kenski, K., Saulnier, T., Folkestad, J.E., Game-based training to mitigate three forms of cognitive bias (2014) Proceedings of Interservice/Industry Training, Simulation and Education Conference (I/ITSEC), pp. 1-12; Clegg, B.A., McKernan, B., Martey, R.M., Taylor, S.M., Stromer-Galley, J., Kenski, K., Effective mitigation of anchoring bias, projection bias, and representativeness bias from serious game-based training (2015) Procedia Manufacturing: Special issue, 3, pp. 1558-1565; Conle, C., An anatomy of narrative curricula (2003) Educational Researcher, 32, pp. 3-15; Csikszentmihalyi, M., LeFevre, J., Optimal experience in work and leisure (1989) Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 56, pp. 815-822; Gee, J.P., (2003) What video games have to teach us about learning and literacy, , London, England, Palgrave Macmillan; Green, M.C., Brock, T.C., Kaufman, G.F., Understanding media enjoyment: The role of transportation into narrative worlds (2004) Communication Theory, 14, pp. 311-327; Houts, P.S., Doak, C.C., Doak, L.G., Loscalzo, M.J., The role of pictures in improving health communication: A review of research on attention, comprehension, recall, and adherence (2006) Patient Education and Counseling, 61, pp. 173-190; Kelle, S., Klemke, R., Specht, M., Effects of game design patterns on basic life support training content (2013) Educational Technology & Society, 16, pp. 275-285; Kincaid, J.P., Fishburne, R.P., Rogers, R.L., Chissom, B.S., (1975) Derivation of new readability formulas (Automated Readability Index, Fog Count and Flesch Reading Ease Formula) for Navy enlisted personnel, , Research Branch Report 8–75, Millington, TN, Naval Technical Training, U.

The independent validation of the Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity (IARPA) Sirius program evaluated game-based cognitive bias training across several games with a common set of control groups. Control groups included a professionally produced video that taught the same cognitive biases and an unrelated video that did not teach any biases. Knowledge was tested immediately after training and after a delay. This article presents the results from the two phases of the Sirius program. Game-based training showed advantages in teaching bias mitigation skills (procedural knowledge) but had no advantage over video instruction in teaching people to answer explicit questions about biases (declarative knowledge). Overall, training effects persisted over time, and games performed as well as and in some cases better than the video-based instruction for knowledge retention. Our results suggest that serious games can be an effective training tool, particularly for teaching procedural knowledge. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.","cognitive bias; game intervention; independent evaluation; serious games",,,,,,,,,"Anderson, J.R., Acquisition of cognitive skill (1982) Psychological Review, 89, pp. 369-406; Bush, R.M., Serious play: An introduction to the Sirius Research Program (2017) Games and Culture, 12, pp. 227-232; Cohen, J., A power primer (1992) Psychological Bulletin, 112, pp. 155-159. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/0033-2909.112.1.155, Retrieved from; Dunbar, N.E., Jensen, M.L., Miller, C.H., Bessarabova, E., Straub, S.K., Wilson, S.N., Mitigating cognitive bias through the use of serious games: Effects of feedback (2014) Persuasive Technology: 9th International Conference, pp. 92-105. , Spagnolli, Chittaro, Gamberini, (eds), Berlin, Germany, Springer,.

We describe two serious games that teach the mitigation of cognitive biases (human tendencies to commit systematic errors in thinking that lead to irrational judgments). Cognitive biases tend to be deeply ingrained and early attempts to reduce biases with training have met with little success. We address this training challenge using bias mitigation theory derived from the literature and an instructional framework to establish the educational content of each game. The mitigation effects of the games were measured through multiple experiment cycles, and multiple play-testing campaigns were conducted to inform instructional model and game design revisions. The final game versions achieved a medium-to-large training effect following a single play session. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.","cognitive bias; game design; iterative testing; serious games; training",,,,,,,,,"Barton, M., Symborski, C., Quinn, M., Morewedge, C.K., Kassam, K.S., Korris, J.H., (2015) The use of theory in designing a serious game for the reduction of cognitive biases, , http://www.digra.org/wp-content/uploads/digital-library/164_Barton_etal_The-Use-of-Theory-in-Designing-a-Serious-Game.pdf, Proceedings of DiGRA 2015 Conference: Diversity of Play, Retrieved from; Beale, I.L., Kato, P.M., Marin-Bowling, V.M., Guthrie, N., Cole, S.W., Improvement in cancer-related knowledge following use of a psychoeducational video game for adolescents and young adults with cancer (2007) Journal of Adolescent Health, 41, pp. 263-270; Croskerry, P., Singhal, G., Mamede, S., Cognitive debiasing 2: Impediments to and strategies for change (2013) BMJ Quality and Safety, 22, pp. ii65-ii72. , 0.1136/bmjqs-2012-001713; Epley, N., Morewedge, C.K., Keysar, B., Perspective taking in children and adults: Equivalent egocentrism but differential correction (2004) Journal of Experimental Social Psychology, 40, pp. 760-768; Evans, J.S.B.T., (2007) Hypothetical thinking: Dual processes in reasoning and judgment, 3. , New York, NY, Psychology Press, (; Gilbert, D.T., Ordinary personology (1998) The handbook of social psychology, 2, pp. 89-150. , Gilbert, Fiske, Lindsey, (eds), Hoboken, NJ, John Wiley,.

However, many choose to play games despite this and have developed specific coping strategies they employ to avoid or respond to harassment. Using grounded theory and in-depth interviews with female gamers, this gender-based case study explores women's strategies for coping with online game-related harassment. It shows that women are first and foremost an active audience, carefully managing their media environment to help ensure positive experiences. At the same time, their strategies come with limitations, such as hiding their contributions to gaming or provoking further harassment. Although women are capable media managers, their continued status as ""outsiders"" deeply affects their gaming experiences and demonstrates a need for cultural change in online environments. © SAGE Publications.","coping mechanisms; gender; in-depth interviews; online harassment; video games",,,,,,,,,"Auerbach, D., Letter to a young male gamer (2014) Slate Magazine, , http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/bitwise/2014/08/zoe_quinn_harassment_a_letter_to_a_young_male-gamer.html, (27); Barak, A., Sexual harassment on the Internet (2005) Social Science Computer Review, 23 (1), pp. 77-92; Berdahl, J.L., The sexual harassment of uppity women (2007) Journal of Applied Psychology, 92, pp. 425-437; Bryce, J., Rutter, J., (2002) Killing Like A Girl: Gendered Gaming and Girl Gamer's Visibility, , (6-8).

Most roguelikes reject contemporary advances in graphical technology and instead present their worlds, items, and creatures as American Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII) characters. This article first considers why this unusual graphical style has endured over time and argues that it is an aesthetic construction of nostalgia that positions roguelikes within a clear history of gameplay philosophies that challenge the prevailing contemporary assumptions of role-playing games. It second notes that the semantic code for understanding the ASCII characters in each and every roguelike is different and explores the construction of these codes, how players decode them, and the potential difficulties in such decodings. The article then combines these to explore how such visuals represent potential new ground in the study of game semiotics. © SAGE Publications.","aesthetics; ASCII; decoding; nethack; nostalgia; permadeath; rogue; roguelikes; role-playing games; RPGs; semantics; semiotics",,,,,,,,,"(1994) Written by Thomas Biskup, , Ancient Domains of Mystery; (1990) Written by Alex Cutler and Andy Astrand, , Angband; (2015) Monsters, , http://angband.oook.cz/monsters.php?q=&t=&s=i&v=Angband+3.1.2v2, Angband.oook.cz; Anglin, D., (2013) You Should Say Roguelike More Often, , http://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/DustinAnglin/20131205/206308/You_should_say_Roguelike_more_often.php; Apperley, T.H., Genre and game studies: Toward a critical approach to video game genres (2006) Simulation Gaming, 37, pp. 6-23; Arsenault, D., Video game genre, evolution, and innovation (2009) Eludamos.

Identifying four specific filters that frame player experiences, I argue that the resulting selectivity is significant because it is characteristic of the F/TPS genre as a whole that, through its wide dissemination, impacts upon the cultural framing of actual warfare. The article illustrates features of selective realism before it conducts in-depth analysis of the titles Spec Ops: The Line and The Last of Us to show how critical game design can invite a conscious unraveling of the generic frames and the ideological positions these invite. The article concludes with a reassessment of arguments regarding alleged sociopolitical impacts of war- and violence-themed computer games. © SAGE Publications.","critical game design; first-person shooter; frames of war; selective realism; Spec Ops: The Line; The Last of Us; third-person shooter; war games",,,,,,,,,"Allen, R., The unreal enemy of ""america's Army (2011) Games and Culture, 6, pp. 38-60; Bogost, I., (2007) Persuasive Games, , Cambridge, MA: MIT Press; Bogost, I., (2008) Unit Operations: An Approach to Video Game Criticism, , Cambridge, MA: MIT Press; Breuer, J., Festl, R., Quandt, T., Digital war: An empirical analysis of narrative elements in military first-person shooters (2012) Journal of Gaming and Virtual Worlds, 4, pp. 215-237; Butler, J., (2009) Frames of War: When Is Life Grievable?, , London, England: Verso; Der Derian, J., (2009) Virtuous War: Mapping the Military-industrial-media-entertainment Network, , London, England: Routledge; Flanagan, M., (2009) Critical Play: Radical Game Design, , Cambridge, MA: MIT Press; Galloway, A., Social realism in gaming (2004) Game Studies, 4. , http://www.gamestudies.org/0401/galloway/; Galloway, A., (2006) Gaming: Essays on Algorithmic Culture, , Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press; Halvorsen, K., (2014) Ludonarrativ Dissonans Og Konsonans: En Analyse Av Fiksjonsinnlevelse Og Spilldesign i Historiedrevne Dataspill, , (Masters thesis).

Released in Japan in 1990, the Neo Geo AES was marketed as a home video game system capable of bridging the gap between the public space of the gaming arcade and the domestic environment of the home. ""Imaginaries"" in this context refer to the dreams and fantasies that accompanied the Neo Geo AES's negotiation of arcade and home spaces as well as the discourses, images, ideas, and beliefs that helped mold its identity as a cultural object. Gaming magazines, I argue, help articulate how the system's failure was tied to its unsuccessful navigation of cultural tensions during a period when gaming culture underwent a rapid relocation from the arcade to the home. © SAGE Publications.","magazines; media history; media imaginary; Neo Geo; video game arcade",,,,,,,,,"Anderson, B., (1991) Imagined Communities: Reflections on the Origin and Spread of Nationalism, , (2nd ed.).

First, why is the experience of playing these games not innately inferior to that of playing games with a first-person point of view, given that the sense of being a character sensing and acting inside the game space could be expected to be much stronger when the character's body seems to be one's own rather than a separate entity in the game space? And second, if the first-person point of view is so ""immersive"" and provides such a sense of being ""inside"" the representational space as is sometimes claimed, why has it never been so prominent in other audiovisual entertainment media such as film and television? © SAGE Publications.","aesthetics; embodiment; first-person; immersion; perspective; point of view; representation; third-person",,,,,,,,,"(2007), Assassin ' s Creed.

The contribution interrogates this labor/play dialectic while looking at recent literature on games being produced within the current capitalist and neoliberal system, focusing on phenomena like “playbour” and on key elements discussed in these theories, from the affordances and limitations of technology to the immaterial technological tools used by gamers and game makers. The article argues that looking at Caillois in relation to Marxism would provide an interesting critical perspective, one that has been underexplored by current approaches. The authors note that contemporary concerns on capitalism and games are far from being at odds with Caillois’ distinction between labur and play and suggest that the influence of Marxism on Caillois’ writings would provide an interesting terrain of further discussion. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.","amateur gamer; dialectics; game studies; Marxism; Roger Caillois; surrealism; voluntary play",,,,,,,,,"Aarseth, E., Editorial (2001) Game Studies, 1; Bien, J., Translator’s introduction (1973) Adventures of the dialectic, pp. ix-xxix. , Merleau-Ponty, (ed), Evanston, IL, Northwestern University Press,.

By harnessing the alternative concepts of “symmetry” and “dissymmetry,” which are at the core of his approach, a textual analysis is applied to the high acclaimed video game Journey. Further suggestions from philosophy (“deconstruction” by Derrida), cultural studies (“the circuit of culture”), and game design support the study. Thus, symmetric and dissymmetric features (e.g., mechanics, aesthetics) are framed enlightening in-game processes further; conversely, the limits of these notions in game analysis are deepened along with some tendencies in misreading Caillois in the field. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.","dissymmetry; Journey; Roger Caillois; symmetry; textual analysis",,,,,,,,,"Adams, E., Dormans, J., (2012) Game mechanics: advanced game design, , San Francisco, CA, New Riders; Alex, C., Interview: Composer Austin Wintory on Journey (2012) TheSixthAxis, , http://www.thesixthaxis.com/2012/03/15/interview-journey-composer-austin-wintory, Retrieved from; Appadurai, A., (1996) Modernity at large, , Minneapolis, MN, University of Minnesota Press; Apperley, T.H., Genre and game studies: Toward a critical approach to video game genres (2006) Simulation & Gaming, 37, pp. 6-23; Arendt, S., Journey review (2012) The Escapist, , http://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/video-games/editorials/reviews/9494-Journey-Review, Retrieved from; Billig, M., Lacan’s misuse of psychology evidence, rhetoric and the mirror stage (2006) Theory, Culture & Society, 23, pp. 1-26; Bogost, I., (2011) How to do things with videogames, , Minneapolis, University of Minnesota Press; Caillois, R., La Mante Religieuse (1934) Minotaure, 5, pp. 23-26; Caillois, R., (1938) Le Mythe et l’Homme, , Paris, France, Gallimard; Caillois, R., (1958) Les Jeux et les Hommes, , Paris, France, Gallimard; Caillois, R., (1938) Man and the sacred, , Glencoe, IL, The Free Press, 1959; Caillois, R., (1970) L’Écriture des Pierres, , Paris, France, Gallimard; Caillois, R., (1973) La Dissymétrie, , Paris, France, Gallimard; Caillois, R., (1976) Cohérences aventureuses, , Paris, France, Gallimard; Caillois, R., (1933) La Nécessité d’esprit, , Paris, France, Gallimard, 1935 1981; Caillois, R., (1935) Mimicry and legendary psychasthenia, 1, pp. 17-32; Caillois, R., Paroxysms of society (2003) The edge of surrealism: A Roger Caillois reader, pp. 284-297. , Frank, (ed), Durham, NC, Duke University Press, a).,.

Yet quite surprisingly, the works of these three authors, Caillois in particular, have mainly been used to establish notable antecedents, not been reevaluated nor discussed. The following pages will first explain the reasons behind these overlooking, taking advantage of the gamification debate to compare the actual theories on the relationship between games and society, subsequently recalling Caillois’ position, pointing out analogies and differences between the present and past stances. Secondly, this article will discuss the reasons to introduce the thought of Caillois in the current debate, showing compatibility between his theories and contemporary reflections, suggesting the possibility to use them to understand gamification, by observing the long-term analogies between games and societies and the role performed by mimicry. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.","design; foursquare; gameful design; gamification; ludification; mimicry; Roger Caillois; steam; surrealism; swarm; valve",,,,,,,,,"Bateson, G., (1996) Questo è un gioco.

This study attempts to examine the structure of ""attribute-consequence-value"" chains of digital games based on the theoretical framework of means-end chains (MECs) and soft laddering interview technique. Results of the study reveal that players pay attention to game attributes including connection system, popular, graphic design, and diverse game genres. From these attributes, players expect consequences such as improve interactivity, cultivate logic and reflex, gain authentic experience, enhance pleasure of senses, and utilize imagination in pursuit of terminal values such as fun and enjoyment of life, sense of accomplishment, warm relationship with others and excitement.

This study used the concept of leisure constraint negotiation process and social capital construct to understand how players deal with the above situation by initiating negotiation strategies to mitigate the constraints. Using partial least squares method as the analytical tool, this empirical study showed that the social interaction element of MMORPG plays a major role in influencing the outcomes of the negotiation process. Social capital plays a role in propelling negotiation strategies, and different types of social capitals are needed to trigger different negotiation strategies. This study further demonstrates: which negotiation strategy is triggered depends on which constraints and negotiation strategies matter most to the leisure seekers. There is also a need for congruence between motivation and negotiation strategy. © The Author(s) 2015.","constraint; constraint negotiation process; massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG); social capital; social interaction",,,,,,,,,"Alexandris, K., Funk, D.C., Pritchard, M., The impact of constraints on motivation, activity attachment, and skier intentions to continue (2011) Journal of Leisure Research, 43, pp. 56-79; Alexandris, K., Tsorbatzoudis, C., Grouios, G., Perceived constraints on recreational sport participation: Investigating their relationship with intrinsic motivation, extrinsic motivation and amotivation (2002) Journal of Leisure Research, 34, pp. 233-252; Arnett, J., Emerging adulthood: A theory of development from the late teens through the twenties (2000) American Psychologist, 55, pp. 469-480; Becker, G., Murphy, K., A theory of rational addiction (1988) Journal of Political Economy, 96, pp. 675-700; Bourdieu, P., Richardson, J.G., (1985) Handbook of Theory and Research for the Sociology of Education, pp. 241-258. , The forms of capital.

This study examines the relationship of various psychosocial variables to online game addiction, and the mediation effect of avatar identification on the relationship. Questionnaires assessing self-esteem, depression, social skills, game addiction, and avatar identification were completed by 163 third-year middle school students. Correlation and structural equation modeling analyses were conducted. Results indicated (a) that self-esteem and social skills had significant negative correlations with game addiction, while depression had a significant positive correlation with game addiction, (b) that depression had an indirect effect on game addiction via avatar identification, and (c) that social skills had both indirect (via avatar identification) and direct effects on game addiction.

This article analyzes these critiques within the 25-year history of the Metroid series, noting intersections with literary theory, cognitive science, geography, and cinema. ""Mapping Metroid"" argues that player dissatisfaction is a result of Other M's inconsistency in balancing gameplay constraints with player agency, and the game's failure at ""imperative"" storytelling. The maps in Other M and its predecessors are treated in depth, since the relationship between cartographic and gameworld spaces must be ""read"" dynamically by players to progress; these maps reflect the affordances of each game, and how those affordances contribute to player enjoyment or frustration. The article concludes with the suggestion that paying attention to signifying spaces may help design better games and help situate video games within a wider discussion of theories of postmodern subjectivity. © The Author(s) 2015.","cognitive mapping; imperative storytelling; Metroid; narrativity; Other M",,,,,,,,,"Aarseth, E., Von Borries, F., Walz, S.P., Bottger, M., Space time play: Computer games, architecture and urbanism: The next level (2007) Allegories of Space.

We then use the tetralemma, a structure from traditional Indian logics, to resolve the paradox of serious games into this larger paradox of observation. Consequently, serious games may only be considered a paradox if we presume realities and define games as deviations therefrom. The increasing gamification of society, however, does not allow realities to be defined in contrast to games anymore. We therefore conclude that serious games do not represent particularly paradoxical forms of games, but rather next levels of reflexivity in communication design and in the self-definitions of next societies. © The Author(s) 2015.","communication design; form theory; oxymoron; paradox; serious games; tetralemma",,,,,,,,,"Abt, C.C., (1987) Serious Games, , Boston, MA: University Press of America; Alexiou, A., Schippers, M., Oshri, I., Positive psychology and digital games: The role of emotions and psychological flow in serious games development (2012) Psychology, 3, pp. 1243-1247; Alvarez, J., Michaud, L., (2008) Serious Games.

This domain remains quite dynamic, and this dynamic does not resemble slow transformations, which researchers in social studies have been previously used to, but it seems to be assuming the form of a multistage revolution. It is possible to outline several elementary issues representing the material of the analysis proposed within this text. In the first instance, the authors focus on the matter of change that occurs in thinking about what a computer truly is and then undertake an attempt to indicate the preliminary elements, which would determine the new character of games aimed at mobile computers. The Ingress game will constitute an example to depict the specification underlying this type of entertainment, as this will make it possible to delineate likely development scenarios for this particular area, especially based on the augmented reality concept and its influence on a modern approach toward entertainment that makes use of new mobile technologies. © The Author(s) 2015.","augmented reality; entertainment; game; Ingress; smartphone",,,,,,,,,"Andersen, M., (2014) Google's Ingress Takes Mobile Gaming to the Streets, , http://www.wired.com/2014/01/a-year-of-google-ingress/; Antoniak, K., (2013) Grywalizacja, Czyli Element Frajdy W Codziennym Yciu, , http://www.naukaipostep.pl/wiadomosci/grywalizacja-czyli-element-frajdy-w-codziennym-zyciu; Azuma, R., A survey of augmented reality (1997) Presence: Teleoperators and Virtual Environments, 6, pp. 355-385; Bell, B., Feiner, S., Haller, M., Billinghurst, M., Thomas, B., (2007) Emerging Technologies of Augmented Reality: Interfaces and Design, pp. 110-137. , Representing and processing screen space in augmented reality.

In this article, both types of games (AVG and MP) were analyzed, in an effort to find categorical structural criteria shared by both. The main objective of this research is to analyze and propose valid and viable categorical shared criteria to guide the enhancement of AVG analysis. To this end, a comparative analysis that encompasses a description of shared elements, analysis of the ludic structures, description of the motor requirements, and analysis of across-the-board categorization criteria was conducted. After the analyzing related research literature and developing a study with experts in MP and video game designers and developers, an academic framework for AVG based on knowledge of MP was proposed.

Prior research has shown that gaming is a controversial issue, with media coverage focusing on either risks or opportunities. To examine the effects of these portrayals, the present study used a 2 × 2 experimental design and exposed participants (N = 360) to a news article that framed gaming in terms of risk or opportunity on the journalistic level and on the level of a corresponding expert statement. By examining the perceived negative effects of games, this study extends previous research by combining framing and third-person research. Results showed that framing gaming indeed had an effect on participants' attitudes. This framing effect was moderated by individual video game use. Despite identifying a traditional third-person perception regarding negative video game effects, we found framing to have no significant influence on third-person perceptions. © The Author(s) 2015.","framing; quantitative experiment; third-person perceptions; video games",,,,,,,,,"Birkland, T.A., Lawrence, R.G., Media framing and policy change after columbine (2009) American Behavioral Scientist, 52, pp. 1405-1425; Boyle, M.P., McLeod, D.M., Rojas, H., The role of ego enhancement and perceived message exposure in third-person judgments concerning violent video games (2008) American Behavioral Scientist, 52, pp. 165-185; Boyle, M.P., Schmierbach, M., McLeod, D.M., Preexisting factors or media effect?

Surveying previous interpretations from Mulvey and McLuhan reveals that these rely upon assumptions based in a literate (Mulvey) and electronic (McLuhan) media environment. These interpretations offer insights into the desires and dangers of media, but they do not capture the unique desires of gaming, which are more about the play between self and other than love of self or other. Thus I offer an updated version for digital gaming. This interpretation portrays Narcissus as becoming entranced by the play between self and image, immediacy and hypermediacy, or control and conditions, leading to a better understanding of digital gaming and virtual space as operating via an economy between these pairs rather than an opposition. This economy produces unique desires not encapsulated by previous interpretations of Narcissus, which are frequently applied to gaming. © The Author(s) 2015.","acoustic space; digital games; Narcissus; virtual space; visual space",,,,,,,,,"Baudrillard, J., (1994) Simulacra and Simulation, , Ann Arbor: University of Michigan Press; Baudry, J.-L., Rosen, P., (1986) Narrative, Apparatus, Ideology: A Film Theory Reader, pp. 286-298. , Ideological effects of the basic cinematographic apparatus.

As the narrative unfolds, it asks compelling questions about the nature of morality, the antagonism between the human and natural worlds, and whether or not humanity is worth saving. To this end, the narrative utilizes elements of naturalism and its more modern form, environmental fiction. © The Author(s) 2015.","Cordyceps; environmental; fiction; morality; naturalism; postapocalypse; The Last of Us",,,,,,,,,"Abbey, E., (1968) Desert Solitaire, , New York, NY: Touchstone; Budd, L.J., Pizer, D., (1995) The Cambridge Companion to American Realism and Naturalism, pp. 21-46. , The American background.

The most familiar surviving stories that connect us to our ancestors take the form of folklore and mythology. Games, too, have served many of the same functions as storytelling. In modern times, games and storytelling are no less prevalent, although the particular forms they take and functions they fulfill have been vastly expanded. Narrative gaming has become extremely popular, allowing for the consumption of both regional heritage and global multiculturalism. This essay will explore the roles of these contemporary narratives and provide an analysis of the transition from the traditional narrative to the live role-playing game. © SAGE Publications.","culture; mythmaking; narrative; role-playing; storytelling",,,,,,,,,"Alexander, J.C., (1998) Neofunctionalism and after, , Malden, MA: Blackwell Publishers; Alexander, J.C., (2003) The meanings of social life: A cultural sociology, , New York, NY: Oxford University Press; Anderson, B., (2006) Imagined Communities, , ([ 1983 ]).

Data were collected from 570 Spanish adolescents (15-16 years old) who completed a self-report questionnaire. A path analysis was carried out to analyze the relationships among the different variables. Time in television, video games, and physical activity were higher in males than in females. The use of television and video games positively predicted the use of active video games, which positively predicted physical activity participation. The findings of this study show that sedentary screen media and physical activity are behaviors that can coexist. The promotion of active video games as part of general strategies for the promotion of physical activity could be desirable, but it is likely to contribute to physical activity levels in only a small way.

As one of the founding examples of the survival horror genre, Resident Evil will be used as a case study example. Specifically, the game will be critically analyzed for its use of corruption in four forms: corruption of media, corruption of nature, corruption of architecture, and corruption of authority. These instances of corruption will be analyzed through two rhetorical theories, schema theory and expectation violations theory, in order to understand why Resident Evil's design was so effective at evoking fear in the hearts of millions of gamers. The analysis is followed by a reflection on Resident Evil's legacy and other future areas of research involving rhetoric and video games. © SAGE Publications.","corruption; expectancy violation theory; resident evil; rhetoric; schema theory; survival horror; zombies",,,,,,,,,"Benjamin, W., Arendt, H., (1969) Illuminations, , New York, NY: Schocken Books; Bettencourt, B.A., Dill, K.E., Greathouse, S.A., Charlton, K., Mulholland, A., Evaluations of in group and out group members: The role of category-based expectancy violation (1997) Journal of Experimental Social Psychology, 33, pp. 224-275; Bolter, J.D., Grusin, R., (1999) Remediation: Understanding new media, , Cambridge, MA: MIT Press; Brummett, B., Electric literature as equipment for living: Haunted house films (1985) Critical Studies in Mass Communication, 2, pp. 247-261; Brummett, B., (2006) Rhetoric in popular culture, , (2nd ed.).

By combining procedural rhetorics, discourse analysis, and autoethnographical research play, it is argued that Dark Souls features post-Panoptical gameplay mechanics of both continuous surveillance and playful exhibitionism and a hybrid gameplay experience of both subjectivation and empowerment. Players randomly confront one another in a notoriously difficult and unforgiving game space that requires commitment and perseverance. The game, it is shown, provides a metaphor for online surveillance mechanics in which players/netizens are not just democratically gazing at each other but subjected to a procedural system determining who can see whom. Simultaneously, players are offered a number of procedural methods and moral archetypes to normalize and empower them. © The Author(s) 2015.","Dark Souls; gaze; invisibility; post-Panopticon; procedural rhetorics; subjectivation; surveillance",,,,,,,,,"Allmer, T., (2012) Towards A Critical Theory of Surveillance in Informational Capitalism, , Frankfurt am Main, Germany: Peter Lang; Barker, J.R., (1993) Administrative Science Quarterly, 38, pp. 408-437. , Tightening the iron cage: Concertive control in self-managing teams; (1991), Battletoads.

This article aims to complement games studies' analytical toolkit with a material causal perspective on players' time spent in Chinese World of Warcraft (WoW). I argue that the WoW gameworld is atypically rich in stimuli that have a strong, or supernormal, capacity to activate the moral cognition reasoning systems identified by Haidt and Joseph's ""moral foundations theory."" Testimonial data gathered during long-term fieldwork in Wuhan, China, and data from a survey of 545 Chinese WoW players, wherein combat role (healer, tank) predicts frequency and type of in-game moral experience, are presented in support of this argument.

I will argue in this article that we can only understand Wright's actions if we think of the game model he developed as a fictional text. Yet Forrester's work, which had been heavily criticized by urban planners, may also be considered as a work of fiction. I rely here on Gough's theories concerning the utility of fiction in exploratory research as well as Smithers' work on exploratory, freeform design work. Both of these models - Wright's and Forrester's - may be adapted, altered, or mined to create new fictional models. I will also cite Woolgar's technology as-text paradigm to explain the ways in which these model texts differ. © The Author(s) 2015.","digital games; history of computing; RAND Corporation; technology as text; urban planning",,,,,,,,,"Adams, P.C., Teaching and learning with SimCity 2000 (1998) Journal of Geography, 97, pp. 47-55; Batty, M., Albeverio, S., Andrey, D., Giordano, P., Vancheri, A., (2007) The Dynamics of Complex Urban Systems: An Interdisciplinary Approach, pp. 1-20. , Fifty years of urban modeling: Macro-statics to micro-dynamics.

An online survey was developed and published on eight World of Warcraft (WoW) player forums to gather information about older gamers' demographic characteristics, play patterns, social interactions in the game, and challenges facing older adults while playing WoW. Results indicate that as for their younger counterparts, older adults' social interactions in MMORPGs are motivated by social, achievement, and immersion factors; can take place on several different levels; and can be casual or intimate. As in previous research, respondents in this study reported that playing MMORPGs offered older adults opportunities to sustain off-line relationships with family and real-life friends and to build meaningful and supportive relationships with game friends. This study also demonstrated that MMORPGs have the potential to function as a ""third place"" for older adults to socialize and be entertained as in a real-world club or coffee shop. © The Author(s) 2015.","MMORPGs; older adults; social interactions; World of Warcraft",,,,,,"Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada, SSHRC

This article follows this reasoning and focuses on game enjoyment in later life. This topic is explored through two qualitative studies with actively playing older adults. The first study (n = 35, aged between 49 and 73) took place in Flanders (the Dutch-speaking part of Belgium), while the second study (n = 40, aged between 44 and 77) was held in the U.S.A. (Virginia and Kentucky). Using the principles of Grounded Theory, three interpretations of game enjoyment in later life were identified, namely, telic, hedonic, and eudaimonic enjoyment.

Although research shows that video games enhance physical and cognitive well-being in older adults, the role of video games in enhancing social interactions has been relatively understudied. We examined the habits, preferences, motivations, and outcomes of video gameplay among older and younger adults who play games with their family members. The findings reveal that sharing in video games does foster relationships and connections while producing positive emotions for both generations. As a consequence, game designers should take into consideration ways to enhance these social aspects of gameplay. © The Author(s) 2015.","intergenerational play; older adults; social gaming; video games",,,,,,,,,"Bianchi-Berthouze, N., Kim, W., Patel, D., Does body movement engage you more in digital game play? and why?

Based on a Foucauldian notion of power and discourse, the central question discussed here is how people above the age of 60 and their engagement with digital games are constituted within existing research. The available literature can be separated into two distinct themes focusing on shaping and maintaining the player and the player's relation to games. A highly functionalistic approach to the use of digital games runs through much of the research due to its preoccupation with social, mental, and bodily health or with the needs of the game industry. This tendency is linked to notions of economical productivity, a theme that is analyzed on the basis of theory formations from cultural gerontology as well as in relation to power and discipline. © The Author(s) 2015.","ageing; cultural gerontology; digital games; discipline; discourse; power",,,,,,,,,"Adams, E., (2010) Fundamentals of Game Design, , Berkeley, CA: New Riders; Alankus, G., Proffitt, R., Kelleher, C., Engsberg, J., Stroke therapy through motion-based games: A case study (2011) Transactions on Accessible Computing, 4, pp. 1-335. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/2039339.2039342; Allaire, J., McLaughlin, A., Trujillo, A., Whitlock, L., LaPorte, L., Gandy, M., Successful aging through digital games: Socioemotional differences between older adult gamers and non-gamers (2013) Computers in Human Behavior, 29, pp. 1302-1306; Allen, A., Foucault and the politics of our selves (2011) History of the Human Sciences, 24, pp. 43-59; Alvesson, M., Beyond neo-positivists, romanticists, and localists: A reflexive approach to interviews in organisational research (2003) The Academy of Management Review, 28, pp. 13-33; Bak, L., Madsen, A., Henrichsen, B., Troldborg, S., (2012) Danskernes Kulturvaner 2012, , Copenhagen, Denmark: Danish Ministry of Culture; Bakardjieva, M., Garden, G., Web 2.0 technologies of the self (2012) Philosophy and Technology, 25, pp. 399-413; Basak, C., Boot, W., Voss, M., Kramer, A., Can training in a real-time strategy video game attenuate cognitive decline in older adults?

This article describes an important element of an international, multicenter, randomized, controlled trial which utilized three purpose-built exergames to facilitate physical activity and to assist with fall prevention of adults aged 65+ years in their homes. Measurement of flow was assessed through the distribution of the Activity Flow State Scale in participants assigned to the intervention group after completion of the trial. Results were analyzed across three areas: study centers, age-groups (50-69 years, 70-78 years, 79-84 years, and 85+), and gender. A positive trend in results was shown by participants from Valencia and Cologne and by gender. Future work should consider qualitative data collection to complement the quantitative data and to provide an in-depth understanding of users' experiences with exergames. © The Author(s) 2015.","aging; digital games; exercise; Flow State Scale; motivation; physical activity",,,,,,"Seventh Framework Programme, FP7: 287361

Most studies suggest that fast-paced action games produce the largest benefits, but previous work has shown that older adults might not necessarily adhere to interventions using action games. To increase intervention adherence, we investigated older adult video game preferences that might bolster adherence by having participants play a competitive game (Mario Kart DS) or a cooperative game (Lego Star Wars: The Complete Saga) alone or with a partner. Although hypotheses regarding cooperative and multiplayer gameplay were not supported, converging evidence suggests multiplayer gameplay may lead to greater enjoyment, which has been previously shown to be related to intervention adherence. Insights for gaming intervention studies in older populations are also provided. © The Author(s) 2015.","competition; cooperation; multiplayer gameplay; older adults; video games",,,,,,"National Institute on Aging, NIA: 3 P01 AG017211","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was funded by NIA 3 P01 AG017211.",,"Baltes, P.B., Kliegl, R., Further testing of limits of cognitive plasticity: Negative age differences in a mnemonic skill are robust (1992) Developmental Psychology, 28, pp. 121-125; Basak, C., Boot, W.R., Voss, M.W., Kramer, A.F., Can training in a real-time strategy videogame attenuate cognitive decline in older adults?

This contradiction prompted us to conduct a literature review, which revealed (a) insufficient involvement of older people within the design of games targeted toward this group and (b) insufficient understanding of their everyday digital gameplay. In this article, we present the conceptualization, design, and evaluation of digital games that active older people found to be sufficiently appealing, playable, and meaningful. A 6-month ethnography of the play experiences of 170 older people helped us to conceptualize these games, which were codesigned through playful everyday activities. To facilitate the development of these games, we designed and evaluated an online game creation platform, which enabled 99 older people with different cultural backgrounds to create, play, and contribute to games. © The Author(s) 2015.","digital games; ethnography; evaluation; older people; participatory action research",,,,,,"TIN2014-53199-C3-3-R9

Participants played a boxing video game as White or Black avatar against a White or Black avatar. Results revealed no main effects for avatar race, but embodiment was found to moderate the relationship between avatar race and in-game behavior. Subsequent probing of this interaction revealed that the Proteus effect was demonstrated for those who experienced greater embodiment. Avatar race was unrelated to the use of stereotypes, but main effects for aggressive cognition and affect were found. Also, same-race conditions demonstrated increased aggressive behavior compared to opposite-race conditions. Theoretical implications of these findings are discussed. © SAGE Publications.","avatars; priming; Proteus effect; race; stereotypes; video games",,,,,,,,,"Anderson, C.A., Attributional style, depression, and loneliness: A cross-cultural comparison of American and Chinese students (1999) Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, 25, pp. 482-499; Anderson, C.A., Carnagey, N.L., Eubanks, J., Exposure to violent media: The effects of songs with violent lyrics on aggressive thoughts and feelings (2003) Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 84, pp. 960-971; Anderson, C.A., Carnagey, N.L., Flanagan, M., Benjamin, A.J., Eubanks, J., Valentine, J.C., Violent video games: Specific effects of violent content on aggressive thoughts and behavior (2004) Advances in Experimental Social Psychology, 36, pp. 199-249; Anderson, C.A., Deuser, W.E., DeNeve, K., Hot temperatures, hostile affect, hostile cognition, and arousal: Tests of a general model of affective aggression (1995) Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, 21, pp. 434-448; Berkowitz, L., Some effects of thoughts on anti- and prosocial influences of media events: A cognitive neoassociation analysis (1984) Psychological Bulletin, 95, pp. 410-427; Buffington, D., Fraley, T., Skill in Black and White: Negotiating media images of race in a sporting context (2008) Journal of Communication Inquiry, 32, pp. 292-310; Bushman, B.J., Anderson, C.A., Violent video games and hostile expectations: A test of the general aggression model (2002) Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, 28, pp. 1679-1686; Children, N., (2001) Fair Play?

However, the concept of learning in context has not yet been fully activated, which is attributed to the limitation in the use of learning games in spaces related to the learning context. To present solutions for this problem, the author proposed a digital-physical reality game (DPRG), a new conceptual framework to enhance the context by mapping fantasy in any ordinary space, such as the inside of a school through speculative research. The learning game was implemented based on the framework of DPRG, and the experiment verified that students became immersed in the story of the actual game through fantasy. They recognized a random space in which the game was played as the space set in the game and cognitively connected the current learning context with the random space. © SAGE Publications.","collaboration; context-based learning game; digital-physical reality game; hybrid reality game; quest-based learning; scaffolding learning; situated learning",,,,,,"Kyung Hee University: KHU-20140421

Variations they explain emanate from a single plane of pure multiplicity, a plane of immanence, differing by their intensities and how those intensities are assembled and diagrammed. The article begins by asking questions specific to the video game plane from which concepts are invented, or here borrowed and adapted from Deleuze and Guattari, to analyze the form in an open-ended manner.

Consequently, simulation-based medical education has been researched primarily in terms of the transfer of skills or the reproduction of professional communities of practice. We make a case for studying simulation-based medical education as a cultural practice, situating it within a history of gaming and simulation, and which, by virtue of distinctive aesthetics, does not simply teach skills or reproduce professional practices but rather transforms how medicine can be made sense of. Three concepts from the field of game studies - play, narrative, and simulation - are deployed to interpret an ethnographic study of hospital-based simulation centers and describe underreported phenomena, including the cooperative work involved in maintaining a fictional world, the narrative conventions by which medical intervention are portrayed, and the political consequences of simulating the division of labor. © SAGE Publications.","aesthetics; education; narrative; play; serious games; simulation",,,,,,,,,"Alinier, G., Learning through play: Simulation scenario = obstacle course + treasure hunt (2008) Clinical Simulation: Operations, Engineering, and Management, pp. 745-749. , Kyle R.

Encountering social anti-gaming discourse and cultural protectionism, the importation and distribution of Japanese console games did not get support from the state. However, it found its way to the audience and gained popularity through piracy, the black market, and the local agents' appropriation, becoming an integrated part of many Chinese early gamers' lives. This article draws upon the intersection of cultural globalization with game studies, calling for an investigation into the complexity of the game industry through its sociohistorical, political, and cultural environment. © SAGE Publications.","active gamers; console games; globalization; Japanese games; nation-state; piracy",,,,,,,,,"Allen, M., Sakamoto, R., (2006) Popular Culture, Globalization, and Japan, , (Eds.).

The author's findings are based upon ethnographic research and participant observation of e-sports audience members, teams, and tournaments, including the 2010 E-sports Champion League tournament in Beijing, the 2012 and 2013 World Cyber Games Festivals in Kunshan, and a 2014 Starcraft II tournament in Shanghai. A comparison of these events leads the author to argue that live e-sports events in China are less about spectatorship than they are about creating a spectacle that presents a carefully crafted vision of Chinese politics, nationalism, and capitalist consumer culture. In these cases, the participants and audience members are not only commodities to be sold but also a means of masking contradictory and highly ambivalent discourses about China's role in technological production, digital game culture, and the promotion of the discourse of Internet addiction. © SAGE Publications.","audience commodity; China; e-sports; patriotic leisure; spectacle",,,,,,,,,"(2014) World E-sports Championship Games (WECG) Is Officially Launched, , http://www.wecg.com/pdf/Press_Release_Eng.pdf, Aegis Gaming Networks & Global Mobile Game Confederation.

China's emerging games market was most prominently featured between 1999 and 2005, while 2006-2011 focused on extreme play behavior in China. Most recently, a discourse of vast business opportunities and stabilizing markets has been presented by Western news media. In total more than 853 news articles are explored in parallel to the theoretical concept of Sinological-orientalism.

This article takes up this challenge and responds in the following way: When we investigate the social existence of online gamers labeled Internet addicts in China, and then subject their social existence to the DSM's own definition of a mental disorder, we discover not a clearly understood mental disorder called Internet gaming disorder but more so an issue of social deviance. © SAGE Publications.","China; deviance; DSM-5; Internet addiction; Internet gaming disorder; youth",,,,,,,,,"Adams, J., In an increasingly wired China, rehab for internet addicts (2009) The Christian Science Monitor, , http://www.csmonitor.com/2009/0106/p01s03-woap.html, January 6.

Distinct from related sensations such as difficulty, frustration is perhaps best characterized as when the agency of the player becomes obstructed. This can lead to the feeling of an ambivalent, uncooperative relationship with the game machine. This article will focus on two examples to demonstrate some of the possible manifestations of frustration in game media. The first, ""Steel Battalion: Heavy Armor,"" will deal with motion control gestures that are misinterpreted by the game in a way that obstructs the player's ability to interact with the game. The second, ""Papers, Please,"" will consider repetitive gameplay that limits the player's actions. Drawing on recent scholarship in animation studies, both cases will be approached as a form of what Sianne Ngai describes as ""animatedness,"" the feeling of becoming an automaton and of having one's agency frustrated by technology. © The Author(s) 2015.","affect; agency; ambivalence; animatedness; frustration; repetition",,,,,,,,,"Auerbach, D., The stupidity of computers (2012) N+1, Machine Politics, (13). , https://nplusonemag.com/issue-13/essays/stupidity-of-computers/, Retrieved August 1, 2014; Auerbach, D., Choose your own formalism (2012) The White Review, , http://www.thewhitereview.org/features/choose-your-own-formalism/, Retrieved August 3, 2014; Auerbach, D., The quick time event (2013) The White Review, , http://www.thewhitereview.org/features/the-quick-time-event/, Retrieved August 5, 2014; Bogost, I., (2012) Alien Phenomenology, Or, What It's Like to Be A Thing, , Minneapolis: The University of Minnesota Press; Bukatman, S., (2012) The Poetics of Slumberland: Animated Spirits and the Animating Spirit, , Berkeley: The University of California Press; Cameron, D., Talk from the top down (2008) Language and Communication, 28, pp. 143-155; Cork, J., (2012) Gameplay Goes AWOL in Mech-combat Revival - Steel Battalion: Heavy Armor.""

Unlike many existing theorizations of gameplay, such as the ""magic circle,"" which theorize play as a break from ordinary life, this article argues for a consideration of play as a continuation of ""the control of the established order."" It argues that many videogames, and in particular sports videogames, can be understood as ""themed"" spaces which share similarities to other themed locations, such as fast-food restaurants and theme parks.

This article considers how the search for a connection to our past can be satisfied through consumption of the richly remediated memories represented in nostalgic videogames. Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon and Gone Home are analyzed framed by Baudrillard's theories of consumer objects and simulation. These videogames make extensive use of 1980s and 1990s cultural referents. In particular, they embed references to media (such as music, film, and television) that epitomize memories of these periods. The aim of the article is to discuss the ways in which the videogames commodify nostalgia to fulfill a consumer need for retrospection, and to examine the extent to which they provide a simulation of cultural memory that blurs historical reality with period modes of representation. © The Author(s) 2015.","hyperreality; memory; nostalgia; remediation; videogames",,,,,,,,,"Blow, J., (2008) Braid, , (Windows, OS X, Linux, Playstation 3 and Xbox 360).

The project of transforming human practices into games to ""enhance"" their performance is related to new management and technology design practices that have been dominant since the 1980s. Studies suggest that this is an ambivalent process through which work comes to seem more attractive even as it makes more intense and invasive demands on its human subject. Beyond this, however, ludefaction grasps the way in which gamification intensifies exploitation in the, probably unprecedented, development of allowing power to tap into the radical imaginary, that is, the facility we have for creating an alternative, better world. A comparison of games with relational art is presented to clarify the stakes and suggest negative principles for progressive game design. © The Author(s) 2015.","art; gamification; ludefaction; play;

Addressing this issue, this research examines the experience of female players in one of the worlds most popular games, League of Legends. Two studies - one qualitative (with 15 participants) and the other quantitative (with 16,821 participants) - confirm that although female players accrue skill at the same rate as males, there remains a dearth of female players in this community. Moreover, those females who play with a male partner are less confident in their skills and often focus on supporting their partners advancement, not their own. This work suggests that one way to address the gender gap in gaming is to better understand and improve the social dynamics within popular games. © The Author(s) 2015.","female gamers; gender in games; League of Legends; mixed methods",,,,,,,,,"Alloway, N., Gilbert, P., Howard, S., Wired up: Young people and electronic media (1998) Video Game Culture: Playing with Masculinity, Violence and Pleasure, pp. 95-114. , London, England: UCL Press; Bandura, A., Self-efficacy: Toward a unifying theory of behavioral change (1977) Psychological Review, 84, p. 191; Bergstrom, K., Virtual inequality: A womans place in cyberspace (2012) Proceedings of the International Conference on the Foundations of Digital Games, pp. 267-269. , ACM, New York, doi:10.1145/2282338.2282394; Bryce, J., Rutter, J., Fleming, S., Jones, I., Leisure cultures: Investigations in sport, media and technology (2003) The Gendering of Computer Gaming: Experience and Space, pp. 3-22. , Eastbourne, England: Leisure Studies Association; Carlson, P., New League of Legends video uses stats to show how €rage doesnt win games.€ (2013) PC Gamer, 12. , http://www.pcgamer.com/2013/09/12/new-league-of-legends-video-uses-stats-to-show-how-rage-doesnt-win-games/; Carr, D., Contexts, gaming pleasures, and gendered preferences (2005) Simulation Gaming, 36, pp. 464-482; Carr, D., Oliver, M., Tanks, chauffeurs and backseat drivers: Competence in MMORPGs (2009) Eludamos, 3, pp. 43-53. , http://www.eludamos.org/index.php/eludamos/article/viewArticle/56/107; Connolly, T.M., Boyle, E.A., MacArthur, E., Hainey, T., Boyle, J.M., A systematic literature review of empirical evidence on computer games and serious games (2012) Computers & Education, 59, pp. 661-686; Consalvo, M., Confronting toxic gamer culture: A challenge for feminist game studies scholars (2012) Ada: A Journal of Gender, New Media, and Technology, No, 1; DiSalvo, B., (2012) Glitch Game Testers: The Design and Study of A Learning Environment for Computational Production with Young African American Males, , Unpublished doctoral dissertation, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA; (2007) Essential Facts about the Computer and Games Industry, , http://www.theesa.com/facts/pdfs/esa_ef_2007.pdf, Entertainment Software Association; (2013) Essential Facts about the Computer and Games Industry, , http://www.theesa.com/facts/pdfs/ESA_EF_2013.pdf, Entertainment Software Association; Feng, J., Spence, I., Pratt, J., Playing an Action Video Game Reduces Gender Differences in Spatial Cognition (2007) Psychological Science, 18, pp. 850-855; Gaudiosi, J., Riot Games League of Legends officially becomes most played PC game in the world (2012) Forbes, 11. , http://forbes.com/technology; Gray, K.L., Intersecting oppressions and online communities (2012) Information, Communication & Society, 15, pp. 411-428; Griffiths, D.N., (2012) The Changing Face of Games: Feeling Angry and Ignored, Fans Look for Someone to Blame.

This article proposes studying the social discourse of video games by analyzing the relationships between game design, the transmission of ideological values, and the construction of social reality. With this aim, an analysis model is constructed based on game design theory and studies of the expressive potential of video games. This model is based on the following three facets of the video game discourse: (1) the representation of the character/player, (2) the game world, and (3) the main actions carried out in it. The fundamental resources of the ludic design and their expressive value are discussed in depth for each aspect. The model is applied to a case study of Grand Theft Auto IV. © The Author(s) 2015.","culture; discourse; game design theory; society; video games",,,,,,,,,"Aarseth, E., (1997) Cybertext.

The study is predicated on research suggesting that relationships exist between certain personality types and willingness to embrace technology and mobile phone ownership. The same might be argued between personality and certain mobile apps, to include games. Little research, however, has examined personality and mobile games. This is unfortunate, as these games lend themselves naturally to problem-solving challenges and are believed to aid with learning. Findings revealed that agreeableness was the most significant personality type in predicting frequency and number of hours spent playing mobile games, while openness was the most consistent predictor of mobile gaming as a whole. However, overall strength of associations was weak, suggesting care in using personality, as it may be a poor predictor. © The Author(s) 2015.","Big Five Inventory; Five-Factor Model of Personality; mobile games; personality traits; smartphones",,,,,,,,,"Abrams, A., Effectiveness of interactive video in teaching basic photography skills (1986) Annual Convention of the Association for Educational Communication and Technology, , Las Vegas; Anckar, B., Dincau, D., Value-added services in mobile commerce: An analytical framework and empirical findings from a national consumer survey (2002) Proceedings of the 35th Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences, , Island of Hawaii, HI: HICSS-35; Anderson, N., US 20th in broadband penetration, trails S.

Most notably, Ian Bogost has introduced the concept of procedural rhetoric. Although Bogost defined rhetoric primarily as persuasion, there is no such definitional harmony among rhetoricians. In this article, I explore possibilities for a rhetorical understanding of video games beyond persuasion. The 2014 iOS and Android game First Strike is an example of the repetition compulsion as a means of compensating for the perceived traumatic Real. In examining this game, I hope to show that the intersection of psychoanalysis and rhetoric allows a productive account of simulation and suggests a way forward beyond the impasse of contingency and structure, attending the formal aspects of trope that make certain procedures durable sites of affective investment and enjoyment. © The Author(s) 2015.","nuclear war; psychoanalysis; rhetoric; simulation; video games",,,,,,,,,"Aaron, D., Playing with apocalypse (1985) The New York Times, 29. , http://www.nytimes.com/1985/12/29/magazine/playing-with-apocalypse.html?pagewanted=1; Aarseth, E.J., (1997) Cybertext: Perspectives on Ergodic Literature, , Baltimore, MD: Johns Hopkins University Press; Abella, A., (2008) Soldiers of Reason: The Rand Corporation and the Rise of the American Empire, , Orlando, FL: Harcourt, Inc; Allen, T., (1987) War Games: The Secret World of the Creators, Players, and Policy Makers Rehearsing World War III Today, , New York, NY: McGraw-Hill; Berger, E., Boulay, H., Zisk, B., Simulation and the city: A critical overview (1970) Simulation & Gaming, 1, pp. 411-428; Bitzer, L.F., The rhetorical situation (1968) Philosophy and Rhetoric, 1, pp. 1-14; (2014) First Strike (Version 1.0.3), , Blindflug Studios.

By dissecting the implicit value judgments motivating different definitions of ""game,"" the underlying aesthetic positions can be excavated, revealing a conceptual landscape of the aesthetics of play. Analysis of various definitions for game provided by both professional game designers and academics allows the identification of distinct aesthetic camps. These include (but are not restricted to) victory, problem, reward, imaginative, social, and uncertainty aesthetics. Additionally, a variety of refinements to these positions can be identified. Collectively, these aesthetic positions outline an answer to the question raised by Mary Midgley's observation that games and art can be unified because they deal with human needs that necessarily have a structure. This article provides a rough sketch of the shape of human play needs and asserts that the unity that can thus be attained must necessarily be diverse. © The Author(s) 2014.","aesthetics of play; game aesthetics; games; play; value judgments",,,,,,,,,"(2004) I Love Bees; (2005) Last Call Poker; Aarseth, E., (2004) Genre Trouble, Electronic Book Review, , http://www.electronicbookreview.com/thread/firstperson/vigilant, Retrieved September 25 2014; Aarseth, E., (2007) Situated Play: Proceedings of the Third International Conference of DiGRA, pp. 130-133. , Akira B., ed.

Popular community opinion paints Russian players as aggressive, cliquish and hostile, and as cheats who exploit the game in order to make (real-world) money. The article also analyzes the ways in which Russian pilots challenge, subvert, and discuss these attitudes. Two key arguments are presented. First, that although perceptions of Russian EVE players are often negative, these discourses in EVE are complicated by the fact that aggression, organization, and tight player groups are prerequisites for success within the game. Second, the opinions and agency of Russian players are highlighted. By examining both Russian- and English-language discussions, we see that rather than being silent victims of discrimination, or economic migrants ""ruining"" the game for other players, Russian pilots inhabit a complex space in a community engaged in two-way dialogue about culture, ethnicity, and play practices in EVE. © The Author(s) 2014.","cultural conflict; Eve Online; MMOs; Russian gaming; Russian studies; Russian video game culture",,,,,,"University of Manchester","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was supported in part by a fee bursary from the University of Manchester.",,"Alexander, B., (2010) Russians in EVE[online Forum Thread], , http://oldforums.eveonline.com/?a=topic&threadID=1278700, (March 3) Retrieved from; Alexandrov, A., (2014) Russkiy Allians Otomstil v Porozhenie v EVE Online [Web Page], , http://games.mail.ru/pc/news/2014-01-28/russkij_aljans_otomstil_za_porazhenie_v_eve_online/, (January 28) Retrieved from; Bartle, R., (1996) Hearts, Clubs, Diamonds, Spades: Players Who Suit MUDs[online Article], , http://mud.co.uk/richard/hcds.htm, Retrieved from; Bazhin, P., (2011) Russkaya Problema EVE Online [Web Page], , http://www.igromania.ru/news/169982/Russkaya_problema_EVE_Online.htm, (September 13) Retrieved from; Bergstrom, K., Carter, M., Woodford, D., Paul, C., Constructing the ideal EVE Online Player (2013) Proceedings of DIGRA 2013 - DeFragging Game Studies, , http://www.digra.org/wp-content/uploads/digital-library/paper_1721.pdf, Retreived from; Breckon, N., EVE online: The bears and the rat (2007) Shacknews, , http://www.shacknews.com/article/48917/eve-online-the-bears-and, (September 13) Retrieved from; Cherneev, O., (2007) Intervju C Masterom: Zhizn v EVE Online [Web Page], , http://games.cnews.ru/articles/10/eve_online_interview_1.html, (April 12) Retrieved from; Cunning, (2012) A Pochemy Inostrantsy Nas Ne Lyubyat?[blog Post], , http://stopgame.ru/blogs/topic/44118, (December 8) Retrieved from; Russian takeover of English channels[online forum thread] (2013) Detritus Newton, , https://forums.eveonline.com/default.aspx?g=posts&m=3995946, (December 12) Retrieved from; Dyer-Witheford, N., De Peuter, G., (2009) Games of Empire: Global Capitalism & Video Games, , Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press;; A pochemy inostrantsy nas ne lyubyat?[online forum thread] (2012) Ferrus Manus, , http://forum.eve-ru.com/index.php?showtopic=99239, (December 16) Retrieved from; Welcome to the new Russian server... !

Applying the concept of ""immaterial labor"" to this underattended aspect of the EVE community, we consider the range of communicative and informational artifacts and activities industrialists enact in support of their involvement in the game - work that happens both in game and crucially outside of it. Moving past the increasingly anachronistic distinctions between digitally mediated labor and leisure, in game and out of game, we examine the relations of production in which these players are situated: to other EVE players, in-game corporations, the game's developer, and the broader digital economy. Seen from this perspective, we consider the extent to which EVE both ideologically and economically supports the extension of capital into increasing aspects of our everyday lives - a ""game"" in which many play, but few win. © The Author(s) 2015.","EVE online; immaterial labor; MMOGs; qualitative research",,,,,,"Air Force Research Laboratory, AFRL","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This research was supported by the Air Force Research Laboratory.",,"Aras, A., B-R5RB: The biggest battle in all of EVE (2014) The Mittani Dot Com, , http://themittani.com/news/b-r5rb-biggest-battle-all-eve, (January 28) Retrieved June 19 2014; Bergstrom, K., EVE Online newbie guides: Helpful information or gatekeeping mechanisms at work?

The larger of these wars involve - two to three battles a day across multiple time zones demanding thousands of players and considerable in-game wealth. As with real wars, the morale of combatants plays a crucial role in the success of a campaign. In this article, I discuss the propaganda produced as a component of these wars and the crucial role that it plays in EVE's virtual warfare. Leveraging broader Internet memes; ""nerd"" tropes; in-jokes; game history; and racial, cultural, and sexist stereotypes, these evocative images serve to bolster support and demoralize opponents. I argue that propaganda can be conceptualized as a form of paratext that emerges from within the game as part of play, rather than a peripheral industry that surrounds it. Consequently, I propose the term ""emitext"" to define this persuasive media. © The Author(s) 2014.","emitexts; EVE Online; metagame; online communities; paratexts; propaganda",,,,,,,"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This research has been supported by the Institute for a Broadband Enabled Society.",,"On Propaganda (2013) Themittani.com, , http://themittani.com/features/propaganda, Alikichi (February 27) Retrieved October 28; Anderson, B., (1991) Imagined Communities: Reflections on the Origin and Spread of Nationalism, , 1991).

In spite of the discernible trauma trend within video games, however, and the potential they exhibit for representing trauma in new ways, they have received very little critical notice from trauma theorists. In this article, we argue that a trauma-theoretical study of games has much to offer our understanding of the ways that trauma can be represented, in addition to giving game studies scholars further insight into how games manage to elicit such strong emotions and difficult ethical quandaries in players. We demonstrate this by performing a close reading of one recent and much-discussed game, The Walking Dead: Season One, analyzing how it incorporates psychological trauma in terms of inter(re)activity, empathy, and complicity. © The Author(s) 2014.","complicity; empathy; interactivity; the walking dead; trauma studies",,,,,,"Bijzonder Onderzoeksfonds, BOF","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This research was funded by a grant from Ghent University's Special Research Fund (BOF).",,"Aarseth, E., (1997) Cybertext: Perspectives on Ergodic Literature, , Baltimore, MD: Johns Hopkins UP; Anthropy, A., (2012) Dys4ia, , fromhttp://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/591565, Retrieved September 23, 2014; Belman, J., Flannagan, M., Designing games to foster empathy (2010) Cognitive Technology, 14, pp. 5-15; (1999) Black Isle Studios, , Planescape: Torment.

In both BioWare series, the player is set on a course to manage ethnic bodies into a racially determined division of labor (as military force), assuming the neutral position of a ""multiculturalist umpire."" I investigate Mass Effect's loyalty mechanic and its genre mixture of the role-playing game with the military shooter to consider how BioWare's signature emphasis on team cooperation and supporting characters can express meanings that value American multiculturalism as exceptional, thus permitting forms of patriarchal and imperial violence to continue unabated. Finally, I consider how the player's choice to play as female rather than male can shift the player's experience from an imperialist attitude toward one of multiracial coalition that focuses on structures of patriarchal power and reproductive control. © The Author(s) 2014.","BioWare; dragon age; dynamical meaning; empire; final fantasy VII; mass effect; multiculturalism; race; role-play",,,,,,,,,"Aarseth, E., (2004) Genre Trouble: Narrativism and the Art of Simulation, , Cambridge, MA: MIT Press; (2009) Wrex and the Art of the Privilege Check, , http://borderhouseblog.com/?p=453, Alex December 2 The Border House; Balibar, E., Wallerstein, I.M., (1991) Race, Nation, Class: Ambiguous Identities, , London, England: Verso; Bhabha, H., (1998) Identity: Community, Culture, Difference, pp. 207-221. , Rutherford J., ed.

A multidisciplinary, mixed-methods research design was deployed for the empirical iteration of the model. This choice was reinforced by the critical review of related literature, which revealed that a combination of evidence from multiple disciplines (psychology, sociology, and technology) could contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of play motivation. An iterative, hypothesis-testing research design was the strategy used to conduct multidisciplinary, mixed-methods research. The initial, theoretical version of the MGM was iterated twice, resulting in a thoroughly developed, empirically grounded version that requires future validation. The value of this approach lies in the fact that it provides to game design stakeholders a methodological tool for understanding play motivation as a multifaceted activity, which could inform their practices. © The Author(s) 2014.","game motivation; MGM; mixed-methods; multidisciplinary research",,,,,,,,,"Bostan, B., Player motivations: A psychological perspective (2009) ACM Computers in Entertainment, 7, pp. 1-22; (2013) What is the Appeal of Candy Crush Saga?, , http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-25334716, British Broadcasting Corporation Retrieved May 19, 2014; Bruckman, A., (1997) MOOSE Crossing: Construction, Community, and Learning in A Networked Virtual World for Kids, , Cambridge, MA: MIT Media Lab; Burn, A., Carr, D., (2006) Computer Games: Text, Narrative and Play, pp. 103-118. , Carr D.

Studies of game elements in nongame contexts tend to describe full packages, with no way of assessing their individual psychological and functional impact. To isolate the effects of framing, students (N = 90) were assigned to either discuss study environment issues through a list of questions, via a competitive discussion board game, or though the same game artifacts but with no game mechanics. Task engagement and self-reported intrinsic motivation were compared between groups. Results demonstrate that the effects of simply framing the activity as a game though vernacular and artifacts holds almost as much psychological power as the full game mechanics. In both game conditions, interest and enjoyment were significantly superior to controls, but other intrinsic motivation variables remained unchanged. Implications for game design in nongame contexts are discussed, and a framework for differentiating ""deep and shallow gamification"" in terms of mechanics and framing is developed. © The Author(s) 2014.","experiment; framing; game mechanics; game psychology; gamification; intrinsic motivation; serious games",,,,,,"Aarhus Universitet, AU","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: The author produced this research under funding from the Aarhus University PhD program in psychology and behavioral sciences.",,"Apter, M.J., (1991) Adult Play: A Reversal Theory Approach, pp. 13-30. , Kerr J.

In a preliminary moment, I will attempt to identify the concepts that underline the franchise's notion of history. Subsequently, I will discuss ways to analyze such a portrayal from the point of view of its audience's response and its potential as a platform for historical reflection. Finally, I will compare Mass Effect's approach to history with that of the retro-futuristic Bioshock games as well as with the discussions about historical strategy games made by historians to determine convergences and dissonance in their employments of historical discourses. It will be argued that Mass Effect's choice-based narrative conditions its notion of history as an individually driven process whose changes are manifested in the short duration and that its hypothetical future is consonant with some of contemporaneity's anxieties about its place in history © The Author(s) 2014.","bioshock; future; historical consciousness; historiography; history; mass effect; videogames",,,,,,,,,"Anderson, B.R.O.G., (1991) Imagined Communities: Reflections on the Origin and Spread of Nationalism, , London, England: Verso; Anderson, S.F., (2011) Technologies of History: Visual Media and the Eccentricity of the Past, , Hanover, NH: Dartmouth College Press; Baudrillard, J., (1981) Simulaces et Simulation, , Paris, France: Galillé; Bauman, Z., (2007) Liquid Times: Living in An Age of Uncertainty, , Cambridge, England: Polity Press; (2007) Mass Effect, , Edmonton, Canada: Electronic Arts; (2012) Mass Effect 3, , Edmonton, Canada: Electronic Arts; Bioware, Mass Effect 3: Space Edition, , http://masseffect.bioware.com/space, (n.d.)

The theoretical section briefly overviews conceptual metaphor theory, the TIME IS SPACE/MOTION metaphor, multimodality, CMT in video games, time in video games, and several studies related to the game. The main section investigates Braid so as to evaluate the ways in which the TIME IS SPACE/MOTION metaphor operates within each of the game worlds and how this affects the narrative and the gameplay. The complex, unconventional relations existing among time, space, motion, and causality result in a unique coupling between the narrative and the use of the TIME IS SPACE/MOTION metaphor. © The Author(s) 2014.","causality; cognition; gameplay; motion; narrative; space; time; video gaming",,,,,,"179013

These practices have engendered the diffusion of participatory online environments in which users present, discuss, and critique their creations. This study analyzes one of these design-driven environments dedicated to game levels created with the popular series LittleBigPlanet. Findings suggest that participants interact guided by their desire to become skilled designers and be recognized as such by their peers. To do so, they enact situated discursive functions that entail a pervasive use of specialist language, the formation of shared design references, and the valorization of new forms of originality based on remixing and intertextuality. By engaging in multimodal practices in a competent community of peer designers, participants create a safe ""discursive studio"" that offers a multiplicity of trajectories for learning and creativity. © SAGE Publications 2014.","Affinity spaces; Discursive design; Discursive studio analysis; Games and learning; LittleBigPlanet",,,,,,,,,"Amabile, T.M., Social psychology of creativity: A componential conceptualization (1983) Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 45, pp. 357-376; Baer, J., Kaufman, J.C., (2012) Being Creative Inside and Outside the Classroom, , Rotterdam, The Netherlands: Sense Publishers;; Baym, N.K., The new shape of online community: The example of Swedish independent music fandom (2007) First Monday, 12; Black, R.W., (2008) Adolescents and Online Fan Fiction, , New York, NY: Peter Lang;; Buster, K., Crawford, P., (2007) The Critique Handbook, , Upper Saddle River, NJ: Pearson Prentice Hall;; Cazden, C., Performance before competence: Assistance to child discourse in the zone of proximal development (1981) Quarterly Newsletter of the Laboratory of Comparative Human Cognition, 3, pp. 5-8; Darracott, J., (1991) Art Criticism: A User's Guide, , London, England: Bellew Pub;; Duncan, S.C., Gamers as designers: A framework for investigating design in gaming affinity spaces (2010) E-Learning and Digital Media, 7, pp. 21-34; Duncan, S.C., (2012) Learning in Video Game Affinity Spaces, pp. 51-83. , Hayes E.

In this context, a major role is played by user-generated content. This article focuses on the participatory practices related to Little Big Planet (LBP) 1, a PlayStation platform video game that encourages users to create and share their own gaming levels. Our theoretical framework refers both to convergence culture and to a specific perspective of game studies that focuses on the cultural and social dimensions that are to be found in gaming and modding practices. A total of 8,829 Italian PlayStation Network (PSN) users were surveyed regarding their gaming practices, their attitude toward digital technology, and their LBP usage experiences. The results show that familiarity with digital technology and a socially oriented attitude to digital technology are clearly related to ""active LBP engagement."" Moreover, PSN users are more likely than other digital platforms users to create their own content. © SAGE Publications 2014.","Little Big Planet; Participatory cultures; PlayStation Network; User-generated video gaming",,,,,,,,,"Acquisti, A., Gross, R., Imagined communities: Awareness, information sharing, and privacy on the Facebook Proceedings of the 6th Workshop on Privacy Enhancing Technologies; Andon, S., (2007) Evaluating Computer-mediated Communication on the University Campus: The Impact of Facebook.com on the Development of Romantic Relationships, , http://aoir.org/conferences/past/ir-8-2007, Internet Research 8.0.

This locates the medium at the heart of our contemporary obsession with how to engage the past and the ""real."" In tethering digital hyperreality to the horizon of history, myth, and ritual, games generate a disavowed and subjunctive engagement with a sense of ""real enough."" They thus resemble Victor Turner's liminoids: autotelic, bounded experiences of leisure that cultivate accepting yet playful attitudes against the ""real enough"" on offer. This commercialized bricolage is not dismissible as inauthentic simulacrum. Rather, such games demonstrate the ways in which new media are recalibrating our modes of engagement with the real. This article analyzes three key aspects of liminoid games: (1) techniques of reappropriation during production, (2) rules and expectations of engagement with the past and the ""real"" that games offer, and (3) emergent ways in which player communities, discourses, and productions recalibrate those politics of engagement. © SAGE Publications 2014.","Emergent; Games; History; Interface; Liminoid; Memory; Myth; Paratext; Real; Ritual; Simulacrum",,,,,,,,,"Abbott, M., Backlash (2010) Brainy Gamer; Appadurai, A., (1996) Modernity at Large, , Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press;; Avellone, C., Video game writing vs writing (2010) Obsidian Forum Community; Baudrillard, J., (1981) Simulacra and Simulation, pp. 43-48. , Glaser S.

These systems, however, are based on questionable principles, for two reasons. First, analyzing the Pan European Game Information (PEGI) and the Entertainment Software Rating Board (ESRB) from a pedagogical point of view, one cannot but notice that they are inherently flawed by contradictions and confusion of different perspectives. Second, these contradictions increase the difficulty for parents who buy video games to understand the rating. This is a considerable drawback, as parents and child caregivers should be the primary targets of such rating systems. This article offers a critical examination of the European PEGI and the North American ESRB rating systems, and, starting from this analysis, suggests improvements that could make video game rating systems more appropriate in terms of their function as parental guidance. © SAGE Publications 2014.","Children's protection; ESRB; PEGI; Rating; Video game",,,,,,,,,"Andreoletti, M., The video game: Questions, taxonomies, similitudes (2010) Research on Education and Media, 1, pp. 79-100; Hobbs, R., (2010) Digital and Media Literacy: A Plan of Action, , Washington, DC: The Aspen Institute;; (2014) Video Game Content Rating System; Brekke, A., Lepre, C., (2007) Burned by 'Hot Coffee'?

Accordingly, a free-association questionnaire was used after participants played the game The Graveyard. The associative method was paired with item hierarchization and clustering techniques using a structural approach. The data were analyzed using mixed methods (frequency analysis, semantic weight, and categorical clustering). Additionally, a cluster analysis was conducted to determine connections between representations. Afterward, categories were compared with the representations the game designers wanted to transmit to the players. The results of the research confirmed the possibility of accessing people's social representations using a video game as stimulus. Cluster analyses depicted that these representations were emotionally linked and socially shared among the players without regard to age or gender. The relation with the designers' representations about the game was found to be not significant. © SAGE Publications 2014.","Art games; Communication; Emotion; Social representations; Video games",,,,,,,,,"Abrudan, E., Prundaru, G., Social representations and ideologies in digital games (2009) Journal of Media Research, 5, pp. 31-41; Araya, S., Las Representaciones Sociales: Ejes Teóricos para su Discusión (2002) Cuaderno de Ciencias Sociales, 127; Bauer, M.W., Gaskell, G., Social representations theory: A progressive research programme for social psychology (2008) Journal for the Theory of Social Behaviour, 38, pp. 335-353; Behrens, J., Yu, C.-H., (2003) Handbook of Psychology: Research Methods in Psychology, pp. 33-63. , Weiner I.

Warhammer 40,000 is the market dominator of the nondigital tabletop wargame genre. In this article, we perform a ludological analysis of the process of preparing, or drafting, an army for a competitive Warhammer 40,000 tournament. We find that there are four interrelated categories of resources that influence this fundamentally playful process. Our results indicate that this process of preparation constitutes a core component of the appeal of Warhammer 40,000. This emphasizes the importance of understanding the diverse activities that go into gameplay that often exceed the computer game ""client"" or board of play. We suggest the category of engagement pastime to encapsulate these extended, ongoing elements of Warhammer 40,000's appeal, which we define as a collection of interlinked and associated activities that serve to occupy one's time and thoughts pleasantly. © The Author(s) 2013.","hobby; ludological analysi; nondigital games; pastime; tournaments; wargaming; Warhammer 40,000",,,,,,,,,"Andy, Rick priestly interview (2011) Tales from the Maelstrom; Apperly, T., (2009) Gaming Rythms: Play and Counterplay from the Situated to the Global, , Amsterdam, Netherlands: Institute of Network Cultures;; Bakker, S., Vorstenbosch, D., Van Den Hoven, E., Hollemans, G., Bergman, T., (2007) Proceedings of the International Conference on Advances in Computer Entertainment Technology, pp. 163-170. , Piekarski W.

Pluralistic ignorance is a mistaken perception of social norms that overwhelms personal attitudes and leads to behavior contrary to an actor's attitude, and it has never been studied in the context of a virtual world. We analyze the presence of pluralistic ignorance in WoW guilds with the use of a sample of 195 players who responded to an Internet-based survey and 15 focus group participants. Findings show that pluralistic ignorance has a demonstrably lower presence in that community of WoW players than in a physical world equivalent, suggesting a higher tendency in that community toward consistency between private attitudes and public behavior. Factors uncovered that explain this difference include anonymity, safety of the Internet as social medium, and a hypersalience of identity in the WoW player community. © The Author(s) 2013.","MMORPGs; online gaming; pluralistic ignorance; virtual community; World of Warcraft",,,,,,,,,"Allport, G., (1924) Social Psychology, , Boston, MA: Houghton Mifflin;; World of Warcraft Subscriber Slump, , http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-15672416, BBC News.

This article seeks to reconceptualize rules for both traditional and digital games, not as a series of restrictions to which the player must submit but rather as a relationship of power that functions through the player and through processes of construction. I argue that the restrictive model of rules is embedded within the liberal humanist paradigm, where power is understood as an external force operating on the subject. Building upon poststructuralist theorizations of power, I demonstrate that rather than operating through restriction, rules construct the possibility of the game, producing the game world and norms of play practice. Through this, I show that rules should not be understood in opposition to player agency, but rather as a contributor to, and product of it. © The Author(s) 2014.","agency; games; play; power; rules",,,,,,,,,"Apperley, T., Dieter, M., Counterplay (2010) The Fibreculture Journal, 16; Avedon, E.M., Sutton-Smith, B., (1971) The Study of Games, , New York, NY: John Wiley;; Caillois, R., (1961) Man, Play and Games, , Barash M., ed.

Valve provides this answer gradually but does not do so explicitly - rather, as they play the games, the players must come to a conclusion on their own as to who Chell really is. By using this very complex form of procedural rhetoric as the core narrative heart of their games, Valve has created a story that relies upon procedural rhetoric, psychological models of identity, identification, and sociological bond formation in the player in order to rhetorically craft a narrative that is cocreated by the player during gameplay. Such rhetorical narrative cocreation has been a longtime goal of game designers, and Valve's achievement in Portal and Portal 2 illustrate the rhetorical power of a procedurally generated narrative. © The Author(s) 2014.","identity; narrative; portal; procedural; rhetoric",,,,,,,,,"Bitzer, L., The rhetorical context (1969) Philosophy and Rhetoric, , Retrieved from JSTOR.com; Ian, B., (2007) Persuasive Games:The Expressive Power of Video Games, , http://amazon.com; Braid, D., Personal narrative and experiential meaning (1996) The Journal of American Folklore 109.431, , Retrieved from JSTOR.com; Dikema, D.A., Aloneness and social form (1992) Symbolic Interaction 15.4, , Retrieved from JSTOR.com; Fiol, C.M., O'Connor, E.J., Identification in face-to-face, hybrid, and pure virtual teams: Untangling the contradictions (2005) Organization Science 16.1, , Retrieved from JSTOR.com; Foreman, P., Whetten, D.A., Member's identification with multiple identity organizations (2002) Organization Science 13.6, , Retrieved from JSTOR.com; (2011) GlaDOS Cave and Chell EPIC SPOILER!, , http://forums.steampowered.com/forums/showthread.php?t=1850363, FusedCore Msg. 1; Punday, D., Narration, intrigue, and reader positioning in electronic narratives (2012) StoryWorlds 4, , Retrieved from Project Muse; Reicher, S., The context of social identity: Domination, resistance, and change (2004) Political Psychology 25.6, , Retrieved from JSTOR.com; Rose, M., (2011) Portal Sells 4 Million Excluding Steam Sales, , http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/34204/ Portal_Sells_4_Million_Excluding_Steam_Sales.php, April 20; Schiffrin, D., Narrative as self-portrait: Sociolinguistic constructions of identity (1996) Language in Society 25.2, , Retrieved from JSTOR.com; (2007) Portal [Software], , http://www.valvesoftware.com/; (2011) Portal 2 [Software], , http://www.valvesoftware.com/; (2011) Portal 2: Lab Rat, , http://www.thinkwithportals.com/comic/; Walker, J., (2012) The Portal 2 That Could Have Been, , http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2012/03/08/the-portal-2-that-could-have- been/, March 8; White, H., The value of narrativity in the representation of reality (1980) Critical Inquiry 7.1, , Retrieved from JSTOR.com","Wendler, Z.R.; Northern Illinois University, Dekalb, IL, United States; email: zacwendler@gmail.com",,,,,,,,15554120,,,,"English","Games Cult.",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84940287579

The game's transformation of the medieval poet into a crusader not only raises concerns about the intersections between video games and war, as Patrick Crogan has observed using other examples, but also asks us to consider the implications of remediating a canonical textual form into an interactive one. I examine the specific textual uses of violence in the game to argue that the appropriation of Inferno presents the mortification of the cross on the hero's flesh as an emblem for the narrative's critique of the modern War on Terror as a crusade. Furthermore, I suggest that, simultaneously, the cross emblematizes the remediation of the 14th-century poem into the video game, accounting for a paratextual ""war"" between the original poem and the appropriated video game. © The Author(s) 2014.","Dante; Inferno; new media; video games; war",,,,,,,,,"Alighieri, D., Lindskoog, K., (1998) Dante's Divine Comedy: Paradise, , Macon, GA: Mercer University Press;; Barolini, T., Expert view (2010) Entertainment Weekly, 1091, p. 79; (2003) MS.

The discipline's objective is to reinterpret the history of games and play via material objects from the past. This essay offers an example of one such case, revisions to Johan Huizinga's Homo Ludens. In 2012, the author conducted an excavation in Gelderland, near Arnhem in the Netherlands, where Johan Huizinga spent his last years before his death on February 1, 1945. The excavation team found a document that was obviously a manuscript page of a major revision of Huizinga's Homo Ludens.

It is an activity connected with no material interest, and no profit can be gained by it. It proceeds within its own proper boundaries of time and space according to fixed rules and in an orderly manner. It promotes the formation of social groupings which tend to surround themselves with secrecy and to stress their difference from the common world by disguise or other means.

The notion that play worked “according to fixed rules and in an orderly manner” ( Huizinga, 1949 , p. 13) is shown here to be contested by Huizinga later in life. This essay considers how this revelation might reconfigure Huizinga’s views about rules and order. In particular, we show why game studies in 1945 utilized a notably different set of words and ideas than they did in 1938 and draw attention to the cultural ramifications therein.",,"Adorno, T.W., (1970) Ästhetische Theorie, , Frankfurt, Germany: Suhrkamp;; Adorno, T.W., (1982) Prisms, , McCarthy T., ed.

Exploring the performativity of text as well as how such textual performance interacts with clown and adaptation, we hope to enact a variety of disruptions of reader expectation, logic and flow, binaries, the academic article as a genre, and the commonly assumed reader-text relationship. Our incorporation of the gimmick of the Choose-Your-Own Adventure applies the clown's nonseriousness to the ""rules"" (of time, of physics, and of academic convention) that differentiate the written text from performance. Our interpretative aim in incorporating these two systems of rules is to consider how space might be opened up for the performativity of text in order to bridge what is, in many respects, an insurmountable gap. © The Author(s) 2014.","adaptation; citation; clown; documentation; ephemerality; gimmickry; liveness; memory; performativity; play",,,,,,,,,"Aarseth, E., (1997) Cybertexts: Perspectives on Ergodic Literature, , Baltimore, MD: John Hopkins UP;; Bakhtin, M., (1968) Rabelais and His World, , Iswolsky H., ed.

The game had players draft candidates in the congressional and presidential elections onto personal teams in order to compete for points and prizes, which were distributed based not only on the candidates' actions but also when players themselves took action to become better informed and involved during the campaign. In the end, Fantasy Election drew over 10,000 active participants. This article scrutinizes the design and effect of the game by using data from MTV's exit survey of Fantasy Election users to explore whether and how games can be used to encourage voter engagement. By considering the self-reported motivations of players, and a broader discussion of the role of play, competition and reward in fostering political and civic participation, we consider how gamification strategies have ambivalent effects on developing a more informed and cooperative civil society. © The Author(s) 2014.","civic engagement; election; gamification; online games; politics",,,,,,,,,"Anderson, S., Stephen Anderson: Long after the thrill: Sustaining passionate users (2011) Vimeo, , http://vimeo.com/21505297, March 25 Retrieved, July 22, 2014, from; Belsky, G., Six reasons why ""gamification"" will rule the business world (2012) Time, , http://business.time.com/2012/08/28/six-reasons-why-gamification-will-rule-the-business-world/, August 28 Retrieved September 5, 2013, from; Bogost, I., Playing politics: Videogames for politics, activism, and advocacy (2006) First Monday, , http://firstmonday.org/htbin/cgiwrap/bin/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/1617/1532, (Special Issue #7).

The article begins with Clifford Geertz's essay ""Deep Play,"" tracing through its lens the possibilities for ""deeply extending play."" The essay extends Geertz's argument that games and play are in/as/of/through culture. Games and play are not generative of, reflective of, just culture. Rather they are intensely interwoven. I argue that games and play, as conceptual categories, need to be viewed as ""experimental systems,"" and those concepts deserve to be informed by alternative perspectives. Finally, the article returns to the notion of ""meaningful play"" as mechanism of sense making and cultural negotiations with structures. Meaningful play lies at the core of exploration and encourages a different kind of reading of play(ful) spaces. Meaningful play is part of what makes games and play so fundamentally an aspect of the human (and nonhuman) condition. © The Author(s) 2014.","culture; Deep Play; ethnography; experimental systems; meaningful play; play",,,,,,,,,"Boellstorff, T., Dubbing culture: Indonesian gay and lesbi subjectivities and ethnography in an already globalized world (2003) American Ethnologist, 30, pp. 225-242; Bogost, I., (2010) Persuasive Games: Free Speech is Not A Marketing Plan, , http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/6158/persuasive_games_free_speech_is_.php?page=1, Retrieved on March 23, 2011, from; Condry, I., (2013) The Soul of Anime: Collaborative Creativity and Japan's Media Success Story, , Durham, NC: Duke University Press;; Damatta, R., Sport in society: An essay on Brazilian football (2009) Vibrant, 6, pp. 98-120; De Koven, B., (1978) The Well-played Game: A Player's Philosophy, , Garden City, NY: Anchor Press;; Deleuze, G., Guattari, F., (1987) A Thousand Plateaus: Capitalism and Schizophrenia, , Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press;; Fischer, M.M.J., (2004) Mute Dreams, Blind Owls and Dispersed Knowledges: Persian Poesis in the Transnational Circuitry, , Durham, NC: Duke University Press;; Fischer, M.M.J., Culture and cultural analysis as experimental systems (2007) Cultural Anthropology, 22, pp. 1-65; Fortun, K., Ethnography In/Of/As open systems (2003) Reviews in Anthropology, 32, pp. 171-190; Geertz, C., (1973) The Interpretation of Cultures: Selected Essays, , New York, NY: Basic Books;; Ghamari-Tabrizi, S., (2005) The Worlds of Herman Kahn: The Intuitive Science of Thermonuclear War, , Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press;; Grayson, N., (2013) Blizzard on Heroes of the Storm, Female Designs in MOBAs, , http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2013/11/22/blizzard-on-heroes-of-the-storm-female-designs-in-mobas/, Retrieved on December 11, 2013, from; Haraway, D.J., (1997) Modest-Witness-AT-Second-Millennium.FemaleMan©-Meets-OncoMouseTM: Feminism and Technoscience, , New York, NY: Routledge Press;; Huizinga, J., (1971) Homo Ludens: A Study of the Play-element in Culture, , Boston, MA: Beacon Press;; Lévy-Strauss, C., (1962) The Savage Mind, , Chicago, IL: The University of Chicago Press;; Malaby, T.M., Beyond play: A new approach to games (2007) Games and Culture, 2, pp. 95-113; Marcus, G.E., Ethnography In/Of the world system: The emergence of multi-sited ethnography (1995) Annual Reviews in Anthropology, 24, pp. 95-117; Marcus, G.E., Fischer, M.M.J., (1999) Anthropology As Cultural Critique: An Experimental Moment in the Human Sciences, , 1999).

It constructs a genealogy by following the idea of a to-and-fro motion characterizing play through Huizinga's Homo Ludens, to Gadamer's Truth and Method, and finally to Nicolas Abraham's essays on the phenomenology of rhythm. By looking at play as a selection of game acts, it is understood as having a style of its own that opens it up to microanalysis and interpretation. By opening up new rhythms and new ways of comporting one's body, play is understood to have a radical connection with the experience of time, and the analysis ends with some speculation on the nature of their relation. © The Author(s) 2014.","gesture; hermeneutics; phenomenology; play; rhythm",,,,,,"Irish Research Council for the Humanities and Social Sciences, IRCHSS

The masculine hegemony of the video game industry creates specific genre expectations about video games. Just as ""extending play"" is about opening itself to new kinds of ways that people play, it also encompasses extending to new audiences. At the same time, there is always a risk of ghettoizing new audiences - reinforcing stereotypes that keep gamers marginalized. This essay analyzes one such extension: the complex relationship between the romance novel and the video game. Modleski illustrates how romance in books, television, and film are often dismissed as frivolous, but also demonstrate how audiences use romantic texts for a wide variety of purposes. Although universal, romance is an experience that can be understood as both general and specific as well as generic and subjective. The video game romance, while not a perfected genre, often struggles with these larger questions about identity and subjectivity. This article explores the tension between subjectivity and interactivity, as it relates to romance and gaming, specifically in the hidden object gaming genre. Analysis focuses on three romance-themed game texts: Harlequin: Hidden Object of Desire, Ravenhearst, and Love and Death: Bitten. With each of these games, I examine the different modes of interactive romance and demonstrate how subjectivity functions within the gameplay, complicating traditional notions of identity and subjectivity within the romance. Additionally, I illustrate how the games ignore the potential of player agency in favor of formulaic structures and subjectivities. © The Author(s) 2014.","gender and gaming; harlequin; hidden object games; romance; video games; women and gaming; women and romance",,,,,,,,,"Althusser, L., (2006) Cultural Theory and Popular Culture, p. 1971. , 2006).

A sport's apparatus is the condition of possibility for its agile bodies. And while professional sport may seem quite distant from free or casual play, by understanding the labor that goes into producing spectacles of institutionalized play, we can gain better purchase on the multiple types of value that reside in, and are extracted from, our daily playing practices.

GIFs open an inquiry about the divide between art and commerce, as well as between play and work. They entail a type of spectatorship that revives outmoded forms of viewership, recalling the animistic tendencies of the reception of early cinema, and privileges the unauthorized and playful sharing of moving images through the figure of what this essay calls the ""dispossessive spectator."" © The Author(s) 2014.","GIF; gift economy; play; spectatorship",,,,,,,,,"Balázs, B., (2010) Visible Man, , New York: Berghahn Books;; Barbrook, R., The hi-Tech gift economy (1998) First Monday, 3. , http://www.firstmonday.org/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/631/552, Retrieved from; Benjamin, W., (1969) Illuminations: Essays and Reflections, , New York, NY: Schocken;; Caillois, R., (1961) Man, Play, and Games, , New York, NY: The Free Press of Glencoe;; Deleuze, G., (1989) Cinema 1: The Movement-image, , Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press;; Eisenstein, S., (1969) Film Form: Essays in Film Theory, , New York, NY: Harcourt;; Epstein, J., (1921) Bonjour Cinema, , Paris, France: Editions de la Sirène;; Galloway, A., (2006) Gaming: Essays on Algorithmic Culture, , Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press;; Hansen, M., (2012) Cinema and Experience: Siegfried Kracauer, Walter Benjamin, and Theodor W.

Online gameplay frequency and demographic information were also examined. Of the 1,332 sampled, those classified as addicted self-reported the largest percentage of (a) playing online games, (b) scheduling their lives around their gameplay, (c) playing games instead of spending time with family and friends, (d) getting into verbal and physical altercations, and (e) playing to interact with friends and strangers. Statistical analysis, however, revealed no significant differences between the groups, perhaps supporting the idea that players progress through a phase of high engagement before reaching the stage of addiction and that those highly engaged might already show traits or behaviors very similar to, if not the same as, those addicted with regard to certain aspects of their social lives. © The Author(s) 2014.","addiction; high engagement; massively multiplayer online games; MMOGs; online video games",,,,,,,,,"Adachi, P.J.C., Willoughby, T., Do video games promote healthy positive youth development?

This occurs in interactive, video, audio, and textual media alike. Immersive game environments intensify this process, as James Gee states in 2003, but intrinsic learning has taken place in board games, and according to Mary Flanagan this dates back at least to 1250. On top of this, games are currently beginning to assert themselves as works of art. Considering game designers as artists raises the bar for creative responsibility. The goal of this article is to further an understanding of the role of the game designer as moral teacher and artist by studying an intersection of ethics and games.

The architectural design that intertwines Facebook and FarmVille is heightened by the formal and informal participation in ritual practices, which we theorize as digital rituals. Facebook and FarmVille provide a substantive case study that delves into the topical blurring of lines around the game space or magic circle. Through digital ethnographic methodologies the article identifies a number of digital ritual engagements that fit well with Grant McCracken's (1986) four different kinds of consumer rituals: exchange rituals, possession rituals, grooming rituals, and divestment rituals. Social gaming is contextualized as the extension of digital third places complicating distinctions between social network and social networking sites. Beyond simply phatic communication or decompression, FarmVille and Facebook through digital ritual participation are increasingly the manifestation of our networked interests, communities, and lives. © The Author(s) 2014.","digital anthropology; digital ethnography; digital ritual; Facebook; FarmVille; magic circle; ritual; social games; social gaming; social media; social networking sites",,,,,,,,,"Beer, D.D., Social network (ing) sites...

It was found that the guild faced stresses on five distinct yet interrelated levels: personal, subgroup, guild, game, and company level. Strong intragroup ties can aid group cohesion but can also cause fragmenting along weaker ties if a strong subgroup leaves the guild. Continual leadership is vital, in part due to the game mechanics that give guild leaders most of the structural power over the guild. Communities may leave their space of origin but maintain ties across several other mediated spaces simultaneously.

Using the evidence of gameplay and industrial context, the article argues that workers on Galaxies often occupied three ideal-typical roles as worldmakers, curators, and toy keepers in an effort not simply to repurpose content but to establish relationships between branded objects, to foment their circulation, and to maintain their longevity. Understanding these tasks and how they manifested themselves in both the work of Galaxies's makers and their unfinished project, provides a vital case study to examine and develop new models to understand contemporary creative work and the intermediaries that labor within this regime as popular culture increasingly is subsumed under the organizational and textual mechanisms of branding through sequels and transmedia. © The Author(s) 2014.","brands; curation; intellectual property; MMO; production; Star Wars; worldmaking",,,,,,,,,"Aaker, D.A., Keller, K.L., Consumer evaluations of brand extensions (1990) Journal of Marketing, 54, pp. 27-41; Arvidsson, A., Brands: A critical perspective (2005) Journal of Consumer Culture, 5, pp. 235-258; Arvidsson, A., (2007) The Logic of the Brand, , Quaderno 36.

The behavior patterns of these three types were compared to identify similarities and differences among them in terms of psychological meanings and values in the online game life. The results illustrate that the online game world can be defined as a new behavioral setting, made possible by digital technology, in which individuals are able to experience three different paths of identity development. © 2013 The Author(s).","Adult players; Identity; Online game world; Self-development; Subjectivity",,,,,,,"The authors thank all participants of this research.

On the level of the story line, time functions as the engine of the narrative arc by opposing cyclical and linear temporality. On the level of the storyworld, characters and the narrative universe are endowed with a temporal extension into past and present beyond the scope of the main story line, which increases player immersion. On the meta-narrative plane of possible worlds, the player has considerable control not only over the decisions the main character takes but also the order in which events occur - as such, the player oversees an important part of the narrative itself. © 2013 The Author(s).","Mass Effect; Narrative; Possible worlds; Storyworld; Time",,,,,,"Fonds Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek, FWO: B/10040/02","The author(s) received the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was funded by the FWO (Fund for Scientific Research Flanders; grant number B/10040/02).",,"Almeida, M.J., Time in narratives (1995) Deixis in Narrative: A Cognitive Science Perspective, pp. 159-189. , Duchan J.

There has been considerable debate about the effects of this mediated experience. Of particular concern is whether these games stage a propaganda campaign for the interests of governments and the military-industrial complex. Some fear that these games are leading us toward a perpetual state of war. However, such discussions have usually focussed on a very narrow selection from the FPS genre. This article examines a large sample, over 160 individual titles, of FPSs with a contemporary setting. The enemies presented by these games are analyzed and found to be far wider than a narrow examination of games based on topical conflicts would suggest, being instead inspired by a range of political, cultural, and literary sources. Any analysis of FPS games needs to take this diversity into account. © 2013 The Author(s).","First-person shooter; History; Militarization; Opponents; Survey",,,,,,,,,"(1997) Shadow Warrior: GT Interactive, , Garland, TX: Author; (1996) Duke Nukem 3D: GT Interactive, , Garland, TX: Author; (1993), Garland, TX: Author; Bandura, A., (1977) Social Learning Theory, , New York, NY: General Learning Press; Baudrillard, J., (1981) Simulacra and Simulation, , Ann Arbor, MI: University of Michigan Press; Baudrillard, J., (1990) The Transparency of Evil.

Role-playing in its traditional form is a complex activity including a game system and a number of communicative conventions where one player takes the role of the game manager in order to implement the rules and provide a world for the other players. In online role-playing games, a programmed system simulates the rule system as well as part of the game manager's tasks, while the rest of the activity is up to the players to define. Some aspects may translate more or less unproblematically across media, others are transformed by the introduction of the programmed system. This reveals some important perspectives on the sort of rules that can be simulated in a programmed system and what this means to the concept of rules in game studies. © The Author(s) 2013.","Communication; Game rules; Gameplay; Media studies; Role-playing",,,,,,,,,"Aarseth, E., (2004) Narrative Across Media, pp. 361-376. , Ryan M-E., ed.

Within cultivation research, this enhanced exposure to war and militarism is supposed to be associated with the adoption of military norms and thinking. Concepts on narrative persuasion specify this relationship between certain narratives and the adoption of story-inherent beliefs. Based on these theoretical concepts, the present study tries to investigate the relationship between aspects of gaming and militaristic attitudes. We carried out a representative survey of 4,500 gamers with an added control group of 500 nongamers. Militaristic attitudes were measured using a newly developed multidimensional militarism scale. Structural equation modeling did not reveal any relationship between gaming and militaristic attitudes. Moreover, neither the gaming type (multiplayer vs. single) nor the gaming frequency or a preference for shooter games was significantly related to militarism. © The Author(s) 2013.","Cultivation; Digital games; First-person shooters; Militaristic attitudes; Narrative persuasion",,,,,,"240864

Based on the historical background and unique characteristics of games, this study investigates the cultural effect of Japanese video games on players in Taiwan. This study also presents an analysis of the differences between TV and the video game as cultural vehicles. We used both quantitative and qualitative methods. Results indicate a relationship between game-playing behavior and the identification of Japanese culture. However, the relationship between video game playing and consumption was nonsignificant. This shows the power of video games in nation-building but not in nation-branding, in contrast with TV. This study presents a discussion of the findings to shed light on the cultural effects of video games. © The Author(s) 2013.","Console game; Cultural studies; Cultural vehicle; Video game; Video game culture",,,,,,,,,"Aarseth, E.J., Computer game studies, year one (2001) Game Studies, p. 1; Althusser, L., (1971) Lenin and Philosophy and Other Essays, pp. 127-186. , Althusser L., ed.

Sadly, little academic work has studied media coverage of video games during this transformation. Williams' analysis of news magazines' coverage from 1970 to 2000 offers the only research into this topic. However, the video game industry has significantly changed since 2000. To remedy this gap, I examine video game coverage in The New York Times over the last three decades. During this period, evaluative articles primarily treat video games as a major threat. However, a small subset of articles rejects this portrayal. During the 1980s and 1990s, this alternative account identifies video games' functional benefits. This narrative changes in the 2000s to celebrating video games' artistic merits. My work contributes to the social construction of technology literature in general by documenting how civil society's cultural understanding of children and entertainment influence the specific narratives The New York Times attaches to video games. © The Author(s) 2013.","children; civil society; entertainment; narrative analysis; social construction of technology",,,,,,,,,"Alexander, J., Smith, P., The discourse of American civil society: A new proposal for cultural studies (1993) Theory and Society, 22, pp. 151-207; Arceneaux, N., Schmitz Weiss, A., Seems stupid until you try it: Press coverage of Twitter, 2006-9 (2010) New Media & Society, 12, pp. 1262-1279; (2009) US Newspaper, , http://abcas3.accessabc.com/ecirc/newstitlesearchus.asp, Audit Bureau of Circulations Retrieved from; Bourdieu, P., (1998) On Television, , New York, NY: New Press;; Bourdieu, P., (2005) Bourdieu and the Journalistic Field, pp. 1-18. , Benson R.

Every text is a reflection of the ideological forces (cultural, economic, social, individual, etc.) generating it. Thus, ideology is essentially an omnipresent entity, which knows no boundaries of class, race, or cultural background. As a matter of fact, games are capable of reflecting ideological stances in a variety of ways. Throughout the first part of this article, we will revisit ideology from a Marxist perspective, that is, as a form of deception, manipulation, and enslavement and subsequently by moving away from such a deterministic/fatalistic approach and discussing it in the light of Gramsci's theory of hegemony. By providing practical examples, this article will attempt to show how both ideological and hegemonic processes operate in the video game medium. © The Author(s) 2013.","Gramsci; ideology; philosophy; procedural rhetoric; video games",,,,,,,"This article is the result of the adaptation of a chapter which the author had written for his PhD that was funded by Malta Government Scholarship Scheme (MGSS).",,"Althusser, L., (1971) Cultural Theory and Popular Culture: A Reader, pp. 151-162. , 1994 Storey J., ed.

Our studies of how emotions are embedded in games and how games sustain affective learning involve observing gameplay and identifying recurring elements that we identify as design patterns. Design patterns help us think about the role of affect in play, what affect in games looks like, and the different ways affective learning might be achieved in educational and serious games. In this article, we describe and discuss several patterns related to understanding emotions, affective representation, and socioemotional interactions, which are essential components of affective learning. These patterns provide a language to conceptualize how affective learning might be designed into future game projects. To conclude, we discuss the development of a taxonomy of affective patterns to sustain socioemotional learning. We thus hope to stimulate the development of more human-oriented educational games in this domain. © The Author(s) 2013.","affective learning; design pattern; emotion; videogames",,,,,,"Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada, SSHRC

Our goal is to design digital game systems that offer the players greater choice in dictating the rules, pacing, and sociability of a game session - we describe this as supporting socially negotiated gameplay. We introduce five design principles of flexibility: dispensability, live tweakability, tangibility, mobility, and value. Our work demonstrates this approach with the design of an augmented game system composed of playing cards instrumented with near field communication chips and a mobile device with three digital game components: a Card Viewer, a Score Board, and a Turn Keeper. We report on initial user sessions and articulate two emerging challenges for supporting socially negotiated play: (a) solving interaction costs to enable greater flexibility and (b) managing user expectations for the automatic part of a manual-automatic system. © The Author(s) 2013.","augmented games; flexibility; game components; game design; tangible interfaces",,,,,,,,,"Barnkow, L., Von Luck, K., Semiautomatic and user-centered orientation of digital artifacts on multi-touch tabletops (2012) Entertainment Computing-ICEC 2012, 7522, pp. 381-388; Cheung, G., Huang, J., (2012) Proceedings of the ACM 2012 Conference on Computer Supported Cooperative Work, pp. 559-568. , New York, NY: ACM;; Crespi, I., The social significance of card playing as a leisure time activity (1956) American Sociological Review, 21, pp. 717-721; Dena, C., Emerging participatory culture practices: Player-created tiers in alternate reality games (2008) Convergence: The International Journal of Research into New Media Technologies, 14, pp. 41-57; Floerkemeier, C., Mattern, F., (2006) Proceedings of the Third International Workshop on Pervasive Gaming Applications - PerGames 2006 at PERVASIVE 2006, pp. 79-88. , Ireland: Dublin;; Frapolli, F., Brocco, A., Malatras, A., Hirsbrunner, B., (2010) Decoupling Aspects in Board Game Modeling, , http://services.igi-global.com/resolvedoi/resolve.aspx, doi:10.4018/jgcms.2010040102.

The gamification fad endorses a canard that games can be strip-mined for ""useful"" bits that, when tacked onto conventional applications, should be expected to have the same effects as true games. This lie exposes a disdain for play and an incapacity to perceive games themselves as useful and worthwhile endeavors. Creating games that achieve great things in the real world while remaining enjoyable experiences instead requires working with the prodigious strengths inherent to the medium. This presentation explores how the native procedurality of video games makes them a potentially ideal way to persuade people to adopt a particular point of view.

A problem for educators is how to motivate learners in these assigned conditions. This study examines the influence of regulatory fit experience on player motivations and time spent on learning aspects of the game. Regulatory fit theory posits that when instructions match the learners' promotion or prevention motivational systems, learners will experience ""regulatory fit,"" which will make them ""feel right"" about the current instructions and tasks. Our findings support the regulatory fit theory. When learners experienced regulatory fit, they played the game for 26% longer time than learners who did not experience regulatory fit. Learners in regulatory fit conditions also displayed more learning-related behaviors such as spending more time on learning feedback both during gameplay and between gameplay sessions. Positive feedback seems to motivate promotion-oriented learners; however, negative feedback did not demotivate prevention-oriented learners as theory predicted. © The Author(s) 2013.","digital game-based learning; motivations; regulatory fit; serious games",,,,,,"National Science Foundation, NSF","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This research is partially supported by grant #0943064 from the National Science Foundation.",,"Aaker, J.L., Lee, A.Y., 'I' seek pleasures and 'we' avoid pains: The role of self-regulatory goals in information processing and persuasion (2001) Journal of Consumer Research, 28, pp. 33-49; Aaker, J.L., Lee, A.T., Understanding regulatory fit (2006) Journal of Marketing Research, 3, pp. 15-19; Avnet, T., Higgins, E.T., How regulatory fit affects value in consumer choices and opinions (2006) Journal of Marketing Research, 43, pp. 1-10; Cacioppo, J., Gardner, W., Berntson, G., The affect system has parallel and integrative processing components: Form follows function (1999) Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 76, pp. 839-855; Camacho, C.J., Higgins, E.T., Luger, L., Moral value transfer from regulatory fit: ""what feels right is right"" and ""what feels wrong is wrong.""

With the advent of mobile technologies such as iPad tablets, new kinds of interactions with subject matter have become possible that have potential for improving learning. The present study used an experimental repeated measures crossover design to investigate whether the iPad fractions game Motion Math would improve fourth graders' fractions knowledge and attitudes. In results from 122 participants, students' fractions test scores improved an average of over 15% after playing Motion Math for 20 min daily over a 5-day period, representing a significant increase compared to a control group. In addition, children's self-efficacy for fractions, as well as their liking of fractions, each improved an average of 10%, representing a statistically significant increase compared to a control group.

It is not only considered the first adventure game but also the ancestor of interactive fiction, point-and-click games, action adventures, and even massively multiplayer online role-playing games. Adventure often defined in terms of categories that did not exist at the time of its making. The concept of video games as the cultural institution we know today was alien to its authors. This article reframes Adventure in its historical context. If it is not yet an adventure game, what is it? The proposed methodology is inspired by the work of early cinema historians and consists of identifying the cultural practices within which an early piece was developed. Adventure is analyzed as a program, a hack, fantasy role-playing, a cave survey, and a game. This approach delivers a new perspective on Adventure, freed to some degree of teleological preconceptions. © The Author(s) 2012.","Adventure; Adventure games; Computer games; Crowther; History; Interactive fiction; Video games; Woods",,,,,,,,,"Aarseth, E., (1997) Cybertext: Perspectives on Ergodic Literature, , Baltimore, MD: JHU Press;; Aarseth, E., (2004) First Person: New Media As Story, Performance, and Game, pp. 45-55. , Wardrip-Fruin D.

This article adds to the scholarship on the production of video games by examining gender and other boundaries in the way work is organized at a U.S. commercial studio. Video games are a result of social conditions in a distinct organizational culture. Changing these conditions to allow for gender and other types of diverse organizational structures can impact the role of video games for the broader culture. The organization of work was analyzed through teamwork and the physical layout of the office space in relation to external customer relations and internal departmental organization. Additionally, the article examines how gender is engaged within these organizational dynamics. These factors contribute to an environment that enables game employees with a certain disposition to affectively invest in boundary maintenance. © The Author(s) 2013.","Game industry; Game production; Gamer; Gender; Social boundaries",,,,,,,,,"Aarseth, E., The culture and business of cross-media productions (2006) Popular Communication, 4, pp. 203-211; Banks, J., Humphreys, S., The labour of user co-creators: Emergence social network markets?

Drawing from personal experience in Second Life and a review of literature, this article maps out an interconnected web of developments across fields that influenced the formation of virtual worlds such as Second Life. The advancements identified in the fields of science fiction, video and computer games, media, role-playing traditions, and communication technologies are analyzed as precursors of the qualities of the contemporary inworld experience. Previous studies have examined the development of the individual fields separately. By undertaking an analysis on a macro level and across fields, this article offers a new insight into the development of the complex phenomenon of virtual worlds in the 21st century, whereby the evolution adopts the structure of a genealogy tree. © The Author(s) 2013.","genealogy; history; Second Life; virtual worlds",,,,,,,,,"Abbate, J., (1999) Inventing the Internet, , Cambridge, MA: MIT Press; Ajana, B., Disembodiment and cyberspace: A phenomenological approach (2005) Electronic Journal of Sociology, 8; Au, W.J., (2008) The Making of Second Life: Notes from the New World, , New York, NY: Collins; Baudrillard, J., (1994) Simulacra and Simulation, , Glaser S.

However, the construction of sexuality within this gaming environment has created an oppressive atmosphere for individuals who do not adhere to a heteronormative lifestyle. In this essay, I undress the bottom-up and top-down structures that are regulating an environment that has no use for a constructed sexual binary and yet has one strictly imbedded in it. This analysis utilizes discourse analysis to analyze 400 messages posted to a WoW discussion board regarding the topic of ""LGBTQ players and the WOW Community"" in order to queer the sexuality presented in this space.

Video games designed by the military or by civilians collaborating with military advisers are one of the major causes for concern, as these may provide ways of training players for military service or of building support for wars. This essay organizes prominent critiques of military gaming into structural/institutional, instrumental, and ideological perspectives and examines some of the most common arguments made from each. It argues that while critics of America's Army and other military games are right to be cautious about military influence on gaming, critics tend to judge military games more harshly than the evidence warrants. © The Author(s) 2013.","America's Army; military entertainment; military games; propaganda; video games",,,,,,,,,"Allen, R., The unreal enemy of America's army (2011) Games and Culture, 6, pp. 38-60; Barnes, J.E., The new action heroes: In a time of war, the army finds innovative ways to promote its warriors (2005) U.S. News World Report, , http://www.usnews.com/usnews/news/articles/051121/051121heroes.htm; Bogost, I., (2007) Persuasive Games: The Expressive Power of Videogames, , Cambridge: MIT Press; (2011) CAPE Products, , http://cape.army.mil/capeProducts.html, July 6 Center for the army profession and ethic; Citino, R.M., (2004) Blitzkrieg to Desert Storm: The Evolution of Operational Warfare, , Lawrence: University Press of Kansas; Clyde, J., Thomas, C., Building an information literacy first-person shooters (2008) Reference Services Review, 36, pp. 366-380; Crogan, P., (2003) The Video Game Theory Reader, pp. 275-302. , Wolf M.

But what does it mean to be a participant, specifically an enactor, within a designed experience such as a video game? Drawing from performance and documentary theory, this research examines the function of enactment in video game experiences, particularly in documentary video games. It presents an analysis of Escape from Woomera, which enables an experience-centered performative inquiry within a recreated environment. I will argue such experiences are best understood as constituting a documentary third space, in which a past experience, read through the body, is vivified. © The Author(s) 2013.","docugames; documentary; performative inquiry; reenactment; video games",,,,,,"Fonds de Recherche du QuÃ©bec - SantÃ©, FRQS","The author(s) disclosed the receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This research was funded by the Fonds de recherche du Québec - Société et culture (FQRSC).",,"Agnew, V., Introduction: What is reenactment?

The impetus for this growth is convergence, specifically technological, content, and market convergence. But gamers might contest this convergence, insofar as it blends genres of participation. Gaming has long been dominated by the hardcore who geek out over their favorite titles. However, a recent influx of casual games, which encourage hanging out means a split in resources. In order to investigate the contestation this might inspire, I analyzed discussions on the site GameTrailers.com. The site features both producer and fan discourse on the state of the videogame industry. On GameTrailers, the debate over convergence comes down to its driving focus: audience convergence. The industry's goal is to create products that bring together a wider range of consumers. Differing perspectives on the worth and outcome of this audience convergence lead to political contestation. © The Author(s) 2013.","audience convergence; convergence; gamers; genres of participation; videogames",,,,,,,,,"Albrechtslund, A.-M., Gamers telling stories: Understanding narrative practices in an online community (2010) Convergence: The International Journal of Research into New Media Technologies, 16, pp. 112-124; Andrejevic, M., Watching television without pity: The productivity of online fans (2008) Television & New Media, 9, pp. 24-46; Banks, J., Humphreys, S., The labour of user co-creation: Emerging social network markets?

The author argues that emulators should be understood as ludic technologies produced by hacking practices that helped spawn and continue to permeate video game culture. Furthermore, while it may be tempting to describe the MAME as a counter archive that challenges institutional models of preservation, by drawing on the work of Coleman the author insists the project is better understood as a hacking practice committed to reordering technologies and infrastructures (p. 515). From this perspective, instead of rejecting institutional archival perspectives that view documents as truth-telling entities, the project hacks the traditional notion of the archive by treating platforms as contingent entities and game code as authentic artifacts. © The Author(s) 2013.","arcade games; archive theory; emulation; hacking; history; platforms",,,,,,,,,"Amis, M., (1982) Invasion of the Space Invaders, , London, England: Hutchinson; Barwick, J., Dearnley, J., Muir, A., Playing games with cultural heritage: A comparative case study analysis of the current status of digital game preservation (2011) Games and Culture, 6, pp. 373-390; Bernstein, C., (2003) The Video Game Theory Reader, pp. 155-168. , Wolf M.

The gaming literature has relied on the field of positive psychology and the concept of flow to explain why gamers are willing to work so hard in order to have fun. However, many games are played within a social context and hence produce explicit rewards capable of generating status and self-esteem for the individual player. The importance of relative position and the invidious comparisons that naturally take place within a social group can be traced back to Thorstein Veblen's Theory of the Leisure Class. Applying Veblen's framework to the modern world of games enables us to develop new insights into why video games have become an important part of life for many in modern society. © The Author(s) 2013.","extrinsic rewards; flow; MMORPG; socially responsible games; Veblen",,,,,,,,,"Castronova, E., (2006) Synthetic Worlds: The Business and Culture of Online Games, , Chicago, IL: University of Chicago Press; Castronova, E., (2008) Exodus to the Virtual World: How Online Fun Is Changing Reality, , New York, NY: Palgrave Macmillan; Chatfield, T., (2010) Fun Inc.: Why Gaming Will Dominate the Twentieth Century, , London: Pegasus; Cordes, C., Veblen's 'Instinct of Workmanship,' its cognitive foundations, and some implications for economic theory (2005) Journal of Economic Issues, 39, pp. 1-20; Csikszentmihalyi, M., (1975) Beyond Boredom and Anxiety: Experiencing Flow in Work and Play, , San Francisco, CA: Jossey-Bass; Dignan, A., (2011) Game Frame: Using Games As A Strategy for Success, , New York, NY: The Free Press;; Frederick, S., Loewenstein, G., (1999) Well Being: The Foundations of Hedonic Psychology, pp. 302-329. , Kahneman D.

This project traces two fantasies (tether and accretions) that combine into the genre of the role-playing game, providing a rough timeline for the evolution of these fantasies in videogames. It also engages in close readings of individual works that highlight important aspects of each fantasy. This study can serve as the basis for a formal analysis of games that is reinforced by their divided nature (game and story). Fantasy can serve as an intermediate term between game and story, and as such can incorporate the player into a game's formal analysis. I also argue that videogames teach us that fantasy is a better term for describing media convergence than story.

The art of these modules reveals a genre and period-specific set of aesthetic codes with distinct subcultural rules of application. In order to construct a sense of nostalgia, the cover art highlights the representation of adventurers, monsters, and dungeon environments within a unique visual style reminiscent of the early Dungeons and Dragons (D&D) aesthetic from the late 1970s and the early 1980s. The Advanced Adventures use nostalgia ideologically as a form of homage to early D&D, to assert the values of old-school gaming, and to chart a new direction for classic fantasy role-playing that challenges the style of play espoused by the current fourth edition of D&D (4E) published by Wizards of the Coast. © The Author(s) 2012.","aesthetics; art; Dungeons and Dragons; nostalgia; role-playing games",,,,,,,,,"Bowman, S., (2010) The Functions of Role-Playing Games: How Participants Create Community, Solve Problems, and Explore Identity, , Jefferson, NC: McFarland; Boym, S., (2001) The Future of Nostalgia, , New York, NY: Basic Books; Brown, S., Retro-Marketing: Yesterday's Tomorrows, Today!

This article considers some of the reasons for this reticence, offering close readings of a number of games in which sex's absence seems especially significant. Attending to these absences can, I argue, throw light on some prevalent misconceptions regarding the nature of video games and the appeal of play. Debates concerning games and sex reveal that commentators, critics, and game developers alike are, by and large, still too ready to judge games using standards developed in relation to other media forms. In doing so they tend both to ignore games' unique characteristics and to misrepresent their potential as vehicles for creative expression-a potential suggested by the ways in which the medium has already begun to explore how technology is altering our understanding of sex. © The Author(s) 2012.","censorship; cinema; media hysteria; new media; posthumanism; sexuality; technology; video games",,,,,,,,,"Atkin, A., Peirce's theory of signs (2010) The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy(Winter 2010 Ed.), , http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2010/entries/peirce-semiotics/, ZaltaE.

Further, the suitability of the video game as a medium for modernist themes and concerns as exemplified by the work of James Joyce, Virginia Woolf, and T. S. Eliot will be explored.

Elves continue to do the same cultural work today and are a fixture of fantasy settings. Fantasy-based video games portray elves in a variety of ways across a few types of elves (high elves, half-elves, and dark elves), but there are consistencies to their portrayal across such spaces. Given the dearth of work on elves in modern narratives, the cultural work of elves as the other in video games is analyzed here. World of Warcraft (WoW), EverQuest II, The Elder Scrolls series, and the Dragon Age series were studied, with Tolkien and Dungeons & Dragons (D&D) as background. Although WoW is somewhat exceptional in its portrayal of elves, digital elves are mostly portrayed similarly to a historically idealized real-world Western minority. © The Author(s) 2012.","elves; games; MMO; other; race",,,,,,,,,"(2011) City Elf, , http://dragonage.bioware.com/dao/characters/city_elf, Bioware May 5; (2011) The History of the Elves, , http://social.bioware.com/wiki/dragonage/index.php/ The_History_of_the_Elves, Bioware May 5; Bogost, I., (2009) Persuasive Games: Little Black Sambo, , http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/4140/persuasive_games, Gamasutra August 6, 2011; Business wire (2011) R.

How players are engaged physically in practice and play is described in this qualitative study through the core themes of movement, haptic engagement, and the balanced body. Furthermore, the research describes how technologies in play are laboring actors too; the players and technologies in this study are rendered as networked, extended, and acting in and on the same fields of play. In asking is there a ""sport"" in e-sports, this study questions the legitimacy of a traditional sports ontology and simultaneously tackles the notion of engagement with computer game play as a legitimate sporting endeavor. © The Author(s) 2012.","balance; Counter-Strike; e-sports; haptic engagement; movement; physicality",,,,,,,,,"Arnold, P., (1979) Meaning in Movement, Sport, and Physical Education, , London, England: Heinemann Education; Ashley, R., Pro Gaming Levels Up, , http://www.1up.com/features/pro-gaming-levels, December 8, 2011; Beamish, R., Ritchie, I., (2006) Fastest, Highest, Strongest: A Critique of High-performance Sport, , London, England: Routledge; Bird, L., Johnson, E., MacMullan, J., (2009) When the Game Was Ours, , Boston, MA: Houghton Mifflin Harcourt; Butryn, T., (2002) Sport Technology: History, Philosophy, and Policy, pp. 111-134. , Miah A.

It uses field notes and experiences from an ethnographic study of the online game World of Warcraft. As opposed to the kind of fieldwork where being, living, and staying in the field is the only option, new media ethnography brings with it the possibility of moving through different locations and bodies to the point where the borders between them may start to blur. The text positions itself within this very uncertainty to investigate its consequences for ways of knowing online game cultures. Drawing on autoethnography, as well as the body of ethnographic work interrogating erotic subjectivity and desire in the field, the discussion makes use of personal experiences - in particular an in-game as well as out-of-the game love affair - as potentially important sources of knowledge. Was it her, regardless of the game? Was it her through the game? Or was it the game ""itself ""? The article provides the story of a particular way of being introduced to and of falling for a game, a woman, and the ways in which these two were intensely connected. Set against the backdrop of ""the affective turn"" in cultural and feminist theory, and in making visible how desire may circulate through game spaces, the article argues for an articulation of desire as intimately related to technology; of desiring technology and of technological, or perhaps technologized desires. © 2012 The Author(s).","desire; epistemology; ethnography; queer; World of Warcraft",,,,,,"VetenskapsrÃ¥det, VR

The developers' evaluation of the relationship from a design point of view will first be presented, before the article goes on to discuss the degree to which the players accept the presence of UI features within the game world. We will see that developers find it challenging to balance between functionality and fiction, but see system features as a necessity that must be present for usability purposes. From the point of departure of players, they rarely consider system features intrusive to the game world, but accept them as integrated to the conventions established within modern computer game aesthetics. © 2012 The Author(s).","game interface; game world; player studies; qualitative studies; user interface",,,,,,"Norges ForskningsrÃ¥d","Thanks to Margrethe Bruun Vaage and the anonymous peer reviewers for comments.

This article is a small step toward correcting that and, in doing so, contributes to game studies in general. Using Goffman's and Benjamin's theories of play and Innis's analysis of media, this article explores the nature of play on a handheld videogame system as an illuminating case of the tension between time-based storage media and space-based transmission media. Storage, transmission, space, and time are intertwined and made complicit in the ways in which the Nintendo DS is used and played. By engaging with non-diegetic aspects of the video game experience, such as saving and pausing, we can begin to address the materiality of handheld video gaming systems as objects with which we play with and rework time and space. In turn, mobile play itself is highly contingent and spatial-temporal practices take on special significance in this light. © 2012 The Author(s).","contingency; mobility; play; saving",,,,,,,,,"Benjamin, W., (1969) Illuminations: Essays and Reflections, , New York, NY: Schocken Books; Benjamin, W., (1986) Reflections: Essays, Aphorisms, Autobiographical Writings, , New York, NY: Schocken Books; De Gournay, C., (2002) Perpetual Contact: Mobile Communication, Private Talk, Public Performance, pp. 193-205. , Katz J.

Many have foreseen exciting new works; while others have cast doubt on the whole endeavor. In terms of actual titles, most games express a familiar story of a hero triumphing against the odds in order to save the day. However, a number of recent titles have attempted to innovate. The Path is one such game. Rather than a tale of heroism, The Path is a tragedy of shattered innocence, powerfully told through play. The authors perform a close reading of this work and highlight the importance of the ludic contract between the player and the game. The authors distinguish two different contracts employed by the work, antagonistic and exploratory, which make different appeals and offer different rewards. The Path manipulates these contracts to lead the player into being both the architect of the tragedy and its helpless victim. © 2012 The Author(s).","analysis; horror; ludic contract; narrative; story; tragedy",,,,,,,,,"Abbott, M., (2009) The Path, the Brainy Gamer, , http://www.brainygamer.com/the_brainy_gamer/2009/03/the-path.html, March Retrieved June 8, 2010; Alexander, L., (2009) The Path for Art Games, , http://kotaku.com/5234167/the-path-for-art-games, April Retrieved June 8, 2010; (1997) Poetics, , London, UK: Penguin Classics; Bernstein, M., Greco, D., (2004) First Person: New Media As Story, Perfor-mance and Game, , Wardrip-Fruin N.

But despite Faith's welcome debut on the main stage of commercial gaming, the game raises more significant questions through its engagement with the multifarious concept of ""fluidity"" or ""flow,"" which is integral to both the gameplay of Mirror's Edge and the themes in it. Is Faith's flow-in line with radical critical moves in literary history and cultural theory of the late 20th century to gender this trope-essentially or inevitably feminine, or for that matter, feminist? Does the game ultimately avoid, perpetuate, or contest the gendered discourses that it evokes? What can its simulations of a fictional mind in action tell us about our own?

While marketing paratexts are crucial to video games because of the vagaries of their industry, they are especially important for Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare, as it is the first of the franchise to be set in the 21st century and immerse players in contemporary theaters of war. These marketing paratexts not only generate hype for the game and work to drive sales, but as importantly, they also suggest particular textual readings over others with the goal of insulating Call of Duty's virtual war play from interpretations and criticisms that might link the violent play on-screen to the worldly violence unfolding in Iraq and Afghanistan. © 2012 The Author(s).","advertising; call of duty; first-person shooter; military; paratext; realism; video game; war",,,,,,,,,"Benedetti, W., (2007) Were Video Games to Blame for Massacre?, , http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/18220228/, April 20 MSNBC; Bogost, I., (2006) Unit Operations: An Approach to Videogame Criticism, , Cambridge, MA: MIT Press; Buffa, C., (2007) Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare Review, p. 3. , http://www.gamedaily.com/games/call-of-duty-4-modern-warfare/xbox-360/ game-reviews/review/6297/1843/, November 5 Game Daily; Buncombe, A., Grand Theft Auto IV is pulled from Thai shops after killing of taxi driver (2008) The Independent, , http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/grand-theft-auto-iv-is- pulled-from-thai-shops-after-killing-of-taxi-driver-885204.html, August 5; (2007), Santa Monica, CA: Activision; Calvert, J., (2003) Families Sue over GTA III-inspired Shootings, , http://www.gamespot.com/ps2/adventure/grandtheftauto3/news_6077161.html, October 22 Gamespot; Collier, G., Evolution of a storyline [Video file] (2007) Game Trailers, , http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8a7hjELe9o; Collier, G., Keirsey, H., Call of Duty 4 authenticity and leveling system interview [Video file] (2007) Game Trailers, , http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXIHfzEfol8; (2000), Oakhurst, CA: Sierra Entertainment; Davison, J., (2010) Medal of Honor: Redux, , http://www.gamepro.com/article/features/214283/medal-of-honor-redux/, March 5 Gamepro; Galloway, A., (2006) Gaming: Essays on Algorithmic Culture, , Minneapolis, MN: University of Minnesota Press; Geddes, R., (2007) Halo 3 Racks Up Record Sales, , http://xbox360.ign.com/articles/823/823255p1.html, September 26 IGN; Gerstmann, J., (2007) Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare Review, , http://www.gamespot.com/pc/action/callofduty4modernwarfare/review.html, November 6 Game spot; Goldstein, H., (2007) Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare Review, , http://xbox360.ign.com/articles/832/832599p2.html, November 5 IGN; (2007) Rockstar Games, , New York; Gray, J., Television pre-views and the meaning of hype (2008) International Journal of Cultural Studies, 11, pp. 33-49; Gray, J., (2010) Show Sold Separately: Promos, Spoilers, and Other Media Paratexts, , New York: NYU Press; Gray, J., (2010) Flow TV: Television in the Age of Media Convergence, , Kackman M.

In this article we investigate boys' play in a tween-centric virtual world called Whyville.net, which had 1.5 million registered players at the time of study. Drawing primarily upon logfile data, we developed participation profiles and case studies of three boy players who ranged in engagement from casual to core players. In the case studies of boy players and their everyday activities in Whyville, we found that initial routines were remarkably similar but over time more nuanced differences emerged in players' identity and boundary play. Furthermore, Whyville provided the boys with relatively low consequence opportunities to experiment with different masculine identities. In comparing our findings with other work, we found that while virtual worlds offer space for the expression of boys' culture, they are qualitatively distinct from other gaming environments and thus need to be studied on their own terms. © 2012 The Author(s).","boys; freedom of movement; gender; masculinity; virtual worlds",,,,,,"National Science Foundation, NSF: NSF-0411814

Here, the author argues that the problem of the division between the real and the virtual has its roots in a philosophical distinction between the transcendent and the immanent. This article examines ethical controversies in the Chinese massively multiplayer online game Zhengtu, a popular ""freemium"" game in which the players who spend the most real-world money become the most powerful. Drawing on player's ethical judgments and classical Chinese philosophy, the author sees how Chinese gamers do not see the game world as an opportunity to create an alternative self, but instead are encouraged to use the game to improve their holistic selves, a project which is inevitably connected to Beijing's neoliberal goals. © 2012 The Author(s).","China; ethics; selfhood; subjectification; virtual worlds",,,,,,,,,"Ames, R.T., (1993) Sun-Tzu: The Art of War, , Ames R.

Yet this genre established practices in game construction that allow developers to foreground narrative experiences. Graphical adventure games made with the Script Creation Utility for Maniac Mansion (SCUMM) engine like Ron Gilbert's The Secret of Monkey Island were among the earliest to produce a sense of a temporal narrativity across the game's many spaces that is not inscribed explicitly at the level of code. These games are therefore key to understanding the origins of video games as a narrative medium. This essay examines the source code to the SCUMM engine in order to show both how its spatialized data structures were used to produce temporal effects similar to those found in more familiar narrative media and how Monkey Island parodies the engine's mechanisms. © 2012 The Author(s).","close reading; data structures; graphical adventure; narrative; platform study; SCUMM; source code; video games",,,,,,,,,"Aarseth, E., (1997) Cybertext: Perspectives on Ergodic Literature, , Baltimore, MA: Johns Hopkins University Press; Barnes, R., Redux: The making of monkey Island (2010) Total PC Gaming Magazine, , http://www.totalpcgaming.com/features/redux-the-making-of-monkey-island/, Retrieved April 27, 2010; Barthes, R., (1977) Image Music Text, , Heath S., ed.

Integrating various streams of computing technology, such as advanced visualization, natural speech processing, and autonomous agents, IS systems are envisioned to offer new, personalized and thus unique kinds of entertainment to mass audiences of the future. The authors refer to existing models of media entertainment for a theoretical analysis and analyze expert interviews with members of the international IS development community to lay out the foundations for a forecast model of the entertainment experience of future IS systems. The resulting model organizes fundamental requirements, modes of users' information processing, and specific types of (pleasant) experiences, which holds implications for (future) entertainment theory and research that accompanies further development of IS media. © 2012 The Author(s).","entertainment; expert study; future entertainment systems; interactivity; media enjoyment; narrative; storytelling",,,,,,"European Commission, EC: IST-FP7-231824","The research presented in this article was funded by the European Commission (Network of Excellence “Integrating Research in Interactive Storytelling: IRIS”, IST-FP7-231824).

This difference is attributed to social expectations regarding the male gender role. Today, help-seeking is moving online: instead of traditional peer groups and counselors, people depend on online communities and e-counselors. But online users can appear in guises that differ from their physical sex. An empirical study was conducted in an online game to examine whether users' avatars' gender influences how they seek and receive help. Analysis is based on user-to-user communications and back-end data. Results indicate that male avatars are less likely to receive sought-for help than female avatars and more likely to be the recipients of indirectly sought help. The authors conclude that avatar gender influences help seeking independent of physical sex: Men overcome their inhibition for help seeking when using female avatars. Practitioners should ensure that means for indirect help seeking are available in order not to exclude male-pattern help seekers. © SAGE Publications 2012.","anonymity; avatars; gender; identity; online games; online therapy; prosocial behavior",,,,,,"Liikesivistysrahasto","The authors disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: Vili Lehdonvirta's research was supported by a grant from the Foundation for Economic Education, Finland.

Concepts from Gilles Deleuze's books on Francis Bacon and cinema are appropriated for this purpose. Three qualities in particular are identified; they center on the role of the player in contributing to the finished form, the nature of the player's canvas, and the sensations that return back to the player when traversing the video game field. It is argued that the concepts used to define the formal qualities of the video game can be deployed to distinguish where a video game succeeds or fails. On the basis of the position developed here, it is argued that Super Mario Galaxy is a masterpiece of the form. © SAGE Publications 2012.","affect; Deleuze; nintendo; rhizome; sensation",,,,,,,,,"Ang, C., Rules, gameplay, and narratives in videogames (2006) Simulation and Gaming, 32, pp. 306-325; Brand, J.E., Knight, S.J., The narrative and ludic nexus in computer games: Diverse worlds II (2005) Proceedings of DiGRA 2005 Conference: Changing Views-Worlds in Play, , http://www.digra.org/dl/db/06278.57359.pdf; Calleja, G., Digital game involvement: A conceptual model (2007) Games and Culture, 2, pp. 236-260; Crawford, C., (2002) The Art of Interactive Design, , San Francisco, CA: No Starch Press; Callois, R., (1962) Man, Play, and Games, , London: Thames and Hudson; Carr, D., (2008) Computer Games: Text, Narrative and Play, , Cambridge, England: Polity Press; Crogan, P., Kennedy, H., Technologies between games and culture (2009) Games and Culture, 4 (2), pp. 107-114; Deleuze, G., (1997) Cinema 1: The Movement-image, , London, England: Athlone Press; Deleuze, G., (2005) Cinema 2, , London, England: Continuum; Deleuze, G., (2008) Francis Bacon: The Logic of Sensation, , London, England: Continuum; Deleuze, G., Guattari, F., (2003), London, England: Continuum; Deleuze, G., Guattari, F., (1994) What Is Philosophy?, , London, England: Verso; Dovey, J., Kennedy, H., (2006) Game Cultures: Computer Games As New Media, , Maidenhead, England: Open University Press; Dyer-Witheford, N., De Peuter, G., (2009) Games of Empire: Global Capitalism and Video Games, , Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press; Dyer-Witheford, N., De Peuter, G., (2009) Empire@Play: Virtual Games and Global Capitalism, , http://www.ctheory.net/articles.aspx?id=608; Ermi, L., Mayra, F., Fundamental components of the gameplay experience: Analysing immersion (2005) Changing Views: Worlds in Play, pp. 15-27. , http://www.uta.fi/~tlilma/gameplay_experience.pdf, Selected Papers of the 2005 Digital Games Research Association's Second International Conference; Eskelinen, M., The gaming situation (2001) Game Studies, 1, pp. 1-14; Galloway, A., StarCraft, or, balance (2007) Grey Room, 28, pp. 86-107; Gingold, C., (2003) Miniature Gardens & Magic Crayons: Games, Spaces, & Worlds, , http://slackworks.com/~cog/writing/thesis/toc.php; Huizinga, J., (1955) Homo Ludens: A Study of the Play Element in Culture, , Boston: Beacon Press; Jones, S., (2008) The Meaning of Video Games, , London, England: Routledge; Kerr, A., Kucklich, J., Brereton, P., New media-New pleasures?

This space is recursive, based on feedback between the state of the game (relations between the objects) and the state of the gamer, which includes their knowledge, skill, mood and attention. The idea of recursive space is developed in two ways. First, as another means of describing a gamer's engagement with space, one that gives a greater account of the participation of technology.

Specifically, using ethnographic interviews and a survey, the authors explore the utility of Yee's three-factor motivational framework for explaining the positive or negative quality of experiences in the popular online game World of Warcraft (2004-2012). The authors find that playing to Achieve is strongly associated with distressful play, results that support findings from other studies. By contrast, Social and Immersion play lead more typically to positive gaming experiences, conclusions diverging from those frequently reported in the literature. Overall, the authors suggest that paying attention to the positive as well as negative dimensions of inhabiting these online worlds will provide both for more balanced portraits of gamers' experiences and also potentially clarify pathways toward problematic and addictive play. © SAGE Publications 2012.","addiction; anthropology; computer games; happiness; MMOs; motivation; problematic Internet use; World of Warcraft",,,,,,,,,"(2002) Atlas Ti v5.2, , www.atlas.ti.com, Berlin: Scientific Software Development GmbH; Bartle, R., (2003) Designing Virtual Worlds, , Indianapolis, IN: New Riders Publishing; Bartle, R., Hearts, clubs, diamonds, spades: Players who suit MUDs (1996) Journal of Online Environments, , http://www.mud.co.uk/richard/hcds.htm, Retrieved March 3, 2012; (2008) Press Release: World of Warcraft Subscriber Base Reaches 11.5 Million Worldwide, , http://us.blizzard.com/en-us/company/press/pressreleases.html?081121, Blizzard Entertainment Retrieved June 25, 2010; Caplan, S.E., Problematic internet use and psychosocial well-being: Development of a theory-based cognitive-behavioral measurement instrument (2002) Computers in Human Behavior, 18, pp. 553-575; Caplan, S.E., Preference for online social interaction: A theory of problematic internet use and psychosocial well-being (2003) Communication Research, 30, pp. 625-648; Caplan, S., Williams, D., Yee, N., Problematic internet use and psychosocial well-being among MMO players (2009) Computers in Human Behavior, 25, pp. 1312-1319; Charlton, J.P., Danforth, I.D.W., Distinguishing addiction and high engagement in the context of online game playing (2007) Computers in Human Behavior, 23, pp. 1531-1548; Choi, D., Kim, J., Why people continue to play online games: In search of critical design factors to increase customer loyalty to online contents (2004) Cyberpsychology and Behavior, 7, pp. 11-24; Chou, T.J., Ting, C.C., The role of flow experience in cyber-game addiction (2003) Cyberpsychology and Behavior, 6, pp. 663-675; Colburn, R.A., Cohen, M.F., Drucker, S.M., The role of eye Gaze in Avatar mediated conversational interfaces (2000) Microsoft Research Tech Report: MSR-TR-2000-81, , http://research.microsoft.com/pubs/69800/tr-2000-81.pdf, July 2000.

The authors are creating an accurately modeled 1964-1965 New York World's Fair where users can freely explore 140+ pavilions set on 660 virtual square acres. The myriad of pavilions offer links to multiple disciplines-science, engineering, technology, national and international political/cultural affairs, art, history, and architecture. The project provides on-site museum experiences with its partners, the New York Hall of Science and Queens Museum of Art.

This article presents the results of a study in which university students were asked to collaboratively solve inquiry-based problems related to historical disease epidemics using game-based learning. A multimethod approach to the data collection was used. Initial results indicated that students attended to visual information with more specificity than text-based information when using a virtual environment. Models of student's decision-making processes when interacting with the world confirmed that students were making decisions related to these visual elements, and not the inquiry process. Building on theories from the learning sciences, such as learning from animations/visualizations and computer-supported collaborative learning, in this article, the authors begin to answer the question of why students learned what they did about historical disease epidemics. © SAGE Publications 2011.","computer-supported collaborative learning (CSCL); educational games; historical inquiry; virtual environments; visualization",,,,,,,,,"Bailenson, J.N., Yee, N., Blascovich, J., Beall, A.C., Lundblad, N., Jin, M., The use of immersive virtual reality in the learning sciences: Digital transformations of teachers, students, and social context (2008) Journal of the Learning Sciences, 17, pp. 102-141; Baker, M., De Vries, E., Lund, K., Quignard, M., Paper Presented at the Proceedings of EuroCSCL 2001-European Perspectives on Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning; Banerjee, M.B., Capozzoli, M., McSweeney, L., Sinha, D., Beyond kappa: A review of interrater agreement measures (1999) The Canadian Journal of Statistics, 27, pp. 3-23; Barab, S.A., Dodge, T., Ingram-Goble, A., Volk, C., Peppler, K., Pettyjohn, P., Solomou, M., (2009) Interactive Storytelling, pp. 332-335. , Lurgel I.

In part derived from the intertextuality of video game genres and associated popular culture artifacts such as films and novels, ritual logic contributes to the players' knowledge and understanding of what ritual is and what ritual does in the game, and how ritual can be used to progress its narrative and play trajectories. © SAGE Publications 2011.","intertextuality; repetition; ritual; rules",,,,,,,,,"Baudrillard, J., (1994) Simulacra and Simulation, , (Sheila Faria Glaser, Trans.).

Despite the popularity and widespread interest in BMCVGs, there is limited information available about the nature of the players' experiences when they engage in BMCVG play. A total of 14 young adults played 6 different BMCVGs for 6 min each and performed traditional cycling exercise in a randomized order. After two familiarization sessions, on a third occasion, subjects rated their enjoyment and completed the Flow State Scale-2 questionnaire. The BMCVGs were rated more enjoyable than traditional cycling exercise and the Flow dimensions Challenge-Skill Balance and Merging of Action and Awareness scored significantly higher than the norms for exercise activity and instead corresponded more closely to the norms for sporting activity. These findings suggest that BMCVGs could therefore act as a gateway for sedentary individuals to become involved in sporting activities. © The Author(s) 2011.","exercise; exergaming; experience; flow; mood; physical activity; sport; video games",,,,,,,,,"Beck, J.C., Wade, M., (2006) The Kids Are Alright: How the Gamer Generation Is Changing the Workplace, , Boston, MA: Harvard Business Press; Behrenshausen, B.G., Toward a (kin) aesthetic of video gaming: The case of dance dance revolution (2007) Games and Culture, 2, pp. 335-354; Blair, R.G., Keele, B., Kozel, C., Prescribing individually tailored exercise as a means of increasing health promotion among university faculty, staff, and students (2007) Californian Journal of Health Promotion, 5, pp. 1-7; Bogost, I., (2007) Persuasive Games: The Expressive Power of Videogames, , Cambridge, MA: The MIT Press; Borg, G., Ratings of perceived exertion and heart rates during short-term cycle exercise and their use in a new cycling strength test (1982) International Journal of Sports Medicine, 3, pp. 153-158; Caspersen, C.J., Merritt, R.K., Physical activity trends among 26 states, 1986-1990 (1995) Medicine & Science in Sports & Exercise, 27, pp. 713-720; Caspersen, C.J., Pereira, M.A., Curran, K.M., Changes in physical activity patterns in the United States, by sex and cross-sectional age (2000) Medicine & Science in Sports & Exercise, 32, pp. 1601-1609; For Disease Control, C., Prevention, (2008) Prevalence of Overweight among Children and Adolescents: United States, 1999-2002, , http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/pubs/pubd/hestats/overwght99.htm, Retrieved September 14, 2009; Chen, J., Flow in games (and everything else) - A well-designed game transports its players to their personal flow zones, delivering genuine feelings of pleasure and happiness (2007) Communications of the ACM, 50, pp. 31-34; Crissey, S.R., Honea, J.C., The relationship between athletic participation and perceptions of body size and weight control in adolescent girls: The role of sport type (2006) Sociology of Sport Journal, 23, pp. 248-272; Csikszentmihalyi, M., (1975) Beyond Boredom and Anxiety, , San Francisco, CA: Jossey-Bass; Csikszentmihalyi, M., Play and intrinsic rewards (1975) Journal of Humanistic Psychology, 15, pp. 41-63; Csikszentmihalyi, M., (1990) Flow: The Psychology of Optimal Experience, , New York, NY: Harper & Row; Csikszentmihalyi, M., Csikszentmihalyi, I.S., (1988) Optimal Experience: Psychological Studies of Flow in Consciousness, , New York, NY: Cambridge University Press; Debell, M., Chapman, C., (2003) Computer and Internet Use by Children and Adolescents in 2001, , http://nces.ed.gov/pubSearch/pubsinfo.asp?pubid=2004014, Retrieved September 14, 2009; Dominick, J., Video games, television violence and aggression in teenagers (1984) Journal of Communication, 34, pp. 136-147; Engh, F., (2002) Why Johnny Hates Sports, , New York, NY: Square One; Fullerton, T., Swain, C., Hoffman, S., (2008) Game Design Workshop: A Playcentric Approach to Creating Innovative Games, , 2nd ed.).

The authors contend that post-apocalyptic digital games merit the same critical examination as their literary and cinematic counterparts, arguing that such games can provide a meaningful site in which questions about the future of technology play out against the dialectic of utopian and dystopian alternatives. Specifically, this article argues that the popular console game BioShock simultaneously celebrates and interrogates utopian notions of technological progress and free will embedded within prevailing industrial and academic conceptions of convergence. The authors explore the differing, yet complementary, conceptions of utopia put forth by critical theorists and the games industry in order to examine how BioShock's ambivalence toward technology-and technologies and practices of media consumption in particular-complicates more idealistic and totalizing forecasts for the future of media convergence. Building upon Alexander Galloway's treatment of gamic action as an ""allegorithm"" that permits procedural exploration and mastery of dominant control protocols in the information age, the authors analyze the way in which BioShock operationalizes the ""control"" logic of convergence. By performing a close reading of the game's ideological content as well as its procedural strategies of transmediation, they link BioShock's ambivalence to the multifaceted, often conflicting nature of convergence discourse and practice within the digital games industry. © The Author(s) 2011.","BioShock; convergence; dystopia; FPS; games industry; utopia",,,,,,,,,"Aarseth, E., Genre trouble: Narrativism and the art of simulation (2004) First Person: New Media As Story, Performance, and Game, pp. 45-55. , N.

Their reactions offer insight into how videogames represent Whiteness and White privilege within the social structure of ""play."" Omi and Winant's (1994) racial formation theory notes that race is formed through cultural representations of human bodies organized in social structures. Accordingly, depictions of race in electronic spaces rely upon media imagery and social interactions. Videogames construct exotic fantasy worlds and peoples as places for White male protagonists to conquer, explore, exploit, and solve. Like their precursors in science fiction, fantasy, and horror, videogame narratives, activities, and players often draw from Western values of White masculinity, White privilege as bounded by conceptions of ""other,"" and relationships organized by coercion and domination. © The Author(s) 2011.","Black; gender and videogames; online racial identity; race and ethnicity; race and videogames; Resident evil 5; Sheva Alomar; Whiteness online",,,,,,,,,"Brock, A., Life on ""the wire"": Deconstructing race on the Internet (2009) Information, Communication, and Society, 12, pp. 344-363; Byrne, D.N., The Future of (The) ""race"": Identity, Discourse, and the Rise of Computer-mediated Public Sphere (2008) The Ecology of Games: Connecting Youth, Games, and Learning, pp. 15-38. , The John D. and Catherine T.

This article builds on previous work in cultural, new media, and game studies to introduce a new approach to productive play, the promise of play. This approach analyzes games as sites of cultural production in times of increased transnational mediation and speaks to the formation of identity across places. The authors ground their explorations in findings from ethnographic research on gaming in urban China. The spread of Internet access and increasing popularity of digital entertainment in China has been used as an indicator of social change and economic progress shaped by global flows. It has also been described as being limited by local forces such as tight information control. As such, gaming technologies in China are ideal to ask broader questions about digital media as sites of production at the intersection of local contingencies and transnational developments. © The Author(s) 2011.","China; contingency; cultural identity; discourse; imagination; Internet legislation; mixed-reality gaming; online gaming; policy; productive play",,,,,,,,,"Anagnost, A., (1997) National Past-times: Narrative, Representation, and Power in Modern China, , Durham, NC: Duke University Press; Anderson, B., (1991) Imagines Communities: Reflections on the Origin and Spread of Nationalism, , New York: Verso Books; Appadurai, A., (1986) The Social Life of Things: Commodities in Cultural Perspective, , Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press; Appadurai, A., Global Ethnoscapes: Notes and Queries for A Transnational Anthropology (1991) Interventions: Anthropologies of the Present, pp. 191-210. , R.

This article presents the results of a 3-year study in which we sought for new ways to approach digital games cultures and playing practices. First, the authors present the research process in brief and emphasize the importance of merging different kinds of methods and materials in the study of games cultures. Second, the authors introduce a gaming mentality heuristics that is not dedicated to a certain domain or genre of games, addressing light casual and light social gaming motivations as well as more dedicated ones in a joint framework. The analysis reveals that, in contrast to common belief, the majority of digital gaming takes place between ""casual relaxing"" and ""committed entertaining,"" where the multiplicity of experiences, feelings, and understandings that people have about their playing and digital games is wide ranging. Digital gaming is thus found to be a multifaceted social and cultural phenomenon that can be understood, practiced, and used in various ways. © The Author(s) 2011.","digital games; game research methodology; games cultures; heuristics; playing mentalities",,,,,,,,,"Bartle, R.A., Hearts, clubs, diamonds, spades: Players who suit MUDs (1996) The Journal of Virtual Environments, 1. , http://www.brandeis.edu/pubs/jove/HTML/v1/bartle.html; Bateman, C., Boon, R., (2006) 21st Century Game Design, , Hingham, MA: Charles River Media; Beyer, H., Holtzblatt, K., (1997) Contextual Design: A Customer-centered Approach to Systems Designs, , San Francisco, CA: Morgan Kaufmann; Brown, A., 'Not for sale?' the destruction and reformation of football communities in the glazer takeover of Manchester United (2007) Soccer & Society, 8, pp. 614-635; Butler, J., (1999) Gender Trouble: Feminism and the Subversion of Identity, , (2nd ed.).

What makes the game analytically interesting is the creation of a game-world designed to promote a feeling of uncertainty in the player. This article explores the ways in which the ambience of uncertainty is developed within the game. Freud's writing on the uncanny and Kristeva's closely related work on abjection is drawn upon to explore how the game works rhetorically to place the player in an unsettled psychological state. The article argues that the use of the heavily gendered symbolism of the uncanny and the abject is value laden and that consequently we must pay attention to that which we cast out, reject, repress, and destroy in the fictive universe of video game play. The article concludes by suggesting that texts such as F.E.A.R. may resonate with wider uncertainties around the self in late-modern life. © The Author(s) 2011.","abject; identity; psychoanalysis; representation; uncanny; video games",,,,,,,,,"Bauman, Z., Morality in the Age of Contingency (1996) Detraditionalisation, pp. 290-299. , P.

Video games and digital worlds are promising new modes of association capable of connecting people in a way that passive forms of mass communication are unable to. This essay shows the strength of video games as a medium for associational life by turning to the thought of one of the preeminent philosophers of collective action: Alexis de Tocqueville. Although Tocqueville lived long before the advent of video games, his theory of democracy provides an excellent account of the benefits of civic associations. Among these are teaching enlightened self-interest, creating feelings of efficacy, protecting individuality, and establishing meritocratic norms. Video games are capable of providing each of these goods, making them an effective supplement, though not a replacement, to traditional associational life in an age of increasing fragmentation. © The Author(s) 2011.","associations; civic culture; public sphere; Tocqueville; video games; virtual worlds",,,,,,,,,"Allison, A., Portable monsters and commodity cuteness: Pokémon as Japan's New Global Power (2003) Postcolonial Studies, 6, pp. 381-395; Almond, G.A., The study of political culture (1990) A Discipline Divided, , G.

Engagement with player characters can be goal-related or empathic, where goal-related engagement depends on affects elicited by goal-status evaluations whereas characters facilitate empathic engagement. The concepts of recognition, alignment, and allegiance are used to describe how engagement is structured in games. Recognition describes aspects of character interpretation. Alignment describes what kind of access players have to a character's actions, knowledge, and affects. Allegiance describes how characters elicit sympathy or antipathy through positive or negative evaluation of the character. © The Author(s) 2011.","empathy; engagement; game characters; goals; player character",,,,,,,,,"Berleant, A., (1991) Art and Engagement, , Philadelphia, PA: Temple University Press; (2006) The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion [Computer Software], , Bethesda Softworks LLC.

In this article, the authors look at implications of this trend for gameplay experiences (especially in terms of immersion, fairness, and fun) and describe a fundamental shift in player self-perceptions as consumers rather than members of a gaming community. This change is occurring at a time when the line separating game and physical worlds is becoming less distinct. The new business model entails a subtle but significant reduction in consumer rights awareness, which explains why some members of the greater gaming community are negotiating a new sense of fairness and arriving at a new consensus regarding legitimate gameplay. © The Author(s) 2011.","cash trade for virtual goods; commercialization of digital media; fairness; free-to-play; magic circle",,,,,,,,,"Bartle, R., (2004) Pitfalls of Virtual Property, , http://www.mud.co.uk/richard/povp.pdf; Castranova, E., The right to play (2004) New York Law School Law Review, 49, pp. 185-210; Copier, M., Connecting worlds: Fantasy role-playing games, ritual acts and the magic circle Paper Presented at the International DiGRA Conference: Changing Views: Worlds in Play, , http://www.digra.org/dl/db/06278.50594.pdf; Csikszentmihalyi, M., (1997) Finding Flow: The Psychology of Engagement with Everyday Life, , New York: Basic Books; Huizinga, J., (1938) Homo Ludens, , Boston: The Beacon Press; Kuecklich, J., Other playings: Cheating in computer games The Other Players Conference, , Paper presented in, Denmark; Lee, J.Y., At the end of the day, free games might cost you the most (2006) PC Gamer, 185, pp. 152-154; Lin, Y.S., The present and the future of digital game market (2005) Advisory & Intelligence Service Program Report, , Taipei : Market Intelligence Center (in Chinese); Liu, C.H., The behavior analysis of Taiwan Internet entertainment in 2006 (2006) Advisory & Intelligence Service Program Report, , Taipei: Market Intelligence Center (in Chinese); Salen, K., Zimmerman, E., (2004) The Rules of Play: Game Design Fundamentals, , Cambridge, MA: MIT Press; Taylor, T.L., (2006) Play between Worlds: Exploring Online Game Culture, , Cambridge, MA: MIT Press; Wu, L.K., The prospect of game software industry in 2007 (2006) Taiwan International Securities Corp (TISC) Research Weekly, , http://www.tisc.com.tw/new/newreport/tiscweekly/upload/ tiscweekly20060922.pdf(inChinese)","Sun, C.-T.; Department of Computer Science, Graduate Institute of Education, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan; email: ctsun@cs.nctu.edu.tw",,,,,,,,15554120,,,,"English","Games Cult.",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-79955839355

Despite modern advances in games technology and design, the findings reveal notable gaps in areas such as the use of back stories, cut scenes, narrative structure and content, emotions, and archetypes, all of which may be expanded to offer richer and potentially more believable narratives. The findings from both essays draw attention to three salient aspects warranting greater efforts during the future development of interactive narrative: temporal, depth, and depiction. © The Author(s) 2011.","computer games; narrative; plot; storytelling; video games",,,,,,,,,"Abbott, H., (2002) The Cambridge Introduction to Narrative, , Cambridge University Press; Atkins, B., (2003) More Than A Game.

The player may experience what the article calls an embodied metaphor, a heightened sense of the linkage between two different orders of reality, real physical gesture and its on-screen representation. Beyond the aesthetic, this metaphor may also increase the player's sensitivity to broader informatic or protocological control outside of the game world, a concept Alexander Galloway develops from Gilles Deleuze's Societies of Control. The embodied metaphor attaches a kinetic materiality to the abstractions of contemporary informatic organization, making them, at least momentarily, concrete and tangible. © The Author(s) 2011.","Aarseth; aporia; computer games; Deleuze; epiphany; first-person shooters; Galloway; interactivity; Metaphor; Riceour; Societies of Control; video games",,,,,,,,,"Aarseth, E., (1997) Cybertext: Perspectives on Ergodic Literature, , Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press; Aarseth, E., Aporia and epiphany in Doom and the Speaking Clock: The Temporality of Ergotic art (1999) Cyberspace Textuality: Computer Technology and Literary Theory, pp. 31-41. , M. -L.

A range of traditional and emerging narrative techniques are considered, including The Hero's Journey, three-act structure, the portrayal of human emotions, and character archetypes, from where an in-depth examination of interactive narrative is performed on a range of old and modern games. Initial results pertaining to the time allocated to narrative, the use of back stories, cut scenes, on-screen text, prompts, and game structure are also presented, which reveal a distinct level of uniformity of how interactive narrative is depicted in games spanning over two decades of industry development. The analysis is concluded in the second article, where further results are revealed to help uncover the precise nature of game narratives. © The Author(s) 2011.","computer games; narrative; plot; storytelling; video games",,,,,,,,,"Aarseth, E., (1997) Cybertext: Perspectives on Ergodic Literature, , Baltimore, MD: The Johns Hopkins University Press; Aarseth, E., Genre trouble: Narrativism and the art of simulation (2004) First Person.

Drawing on unobtrusive behavioral data captured by the game, combined with a large survey and traditional ethnographic methods, the study found that role players both negotiate identity and use their time online as a moratorium for their offline lives. Descriptive results showed that role players are a relatively small, but psychologically burdened subgroup. When examined from the theoretical perspectives of Goffman's Self-Presentation theory, Huizenga's Magic Circle, and Turkle's early work on online identity formation, these players were seen as largely using virtual spaces as creative outlets and for socialization. The worlds also functioned as coping mechanisms for players frequently unable to gain acceptance, social connectivity or social support offline due to their personal situation, psychological profile, or their minority status. © The Author(s) 2011.","identity; MMO; role playing; video games; virtual world",,,,,,,,,"84% of North Americans say CEOs should make helping employees in the workplace with depression a key human resource priority (2007) Ipsos-Insight, 13. , Anonymous, Washington, DC; Bailenson, J., Beall, A., Blascovich, J., Loomis, J., Turk, M., Transformed social interaction, augmented gaze, and social influence in immersive virtual environments (2005) Human Communication Research, 31, pp. 511-537; Bandura, A., The social cognitive theory of mass communication (1994) Media Effects: Advances in Theory and Research, pp. 61-90. , J.

Yet, some studies still conceptualize games as ''virtual'' realms that are theoretically distinct from ''real world'' experiences. Based on an ethnographic investigation of two online, text-based gaming environments, this study analyzes dynamics such as technical acculturation, access to technical knowledge, and opportunities for self-expression by studying social interaction that occurred in non-revenue-generating games. Frameworks that focus on dynamics such as in-game conversation in broader game-centric domains or ecologies should be considered to accommodate a wider variety of gaming forms and related interdisciplinary research questions. Different games have different consequences, and it is important to understand the varying consequential contexts that games afford. Whether or not the consequences may be measured economically, it is nevertheless important to consider how social interactions may complicate forms of self-expression in ways that impact the human spirit. © The Author(s) 2011.","acculturation; chat; conceptual frameworks; ethnography; gender; knowledge sharing; MUDs; self-expression",,,,,,,,,"Anderson, B., (1983) Imagined Communities, , London, England: Verso; Bourdieu, P., The Berber house or the world reversed (1970) Social Science Information, 9, pp. 151-170; Bourdieu, P., (1982) Language and Symbolic Power, , Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press; Bourdieu, P., The forms of capital (1983) The Sociology of Economic Life, pp. 96-111. , M.

In particular, this is most visible in the realm of console video game development but is visible in many other contexts as well. It uses the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) as an index into this complex and highly structured world that frequently disappears from developers perception. The essay uses largely historical data drawn from patent filings, Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filings, and court cases to analyze these networks. The essay argues that these inter/intranetworks, as constructed, have been instrumental in the way that the game industry now finds itself structured and that as the industry has ''matured,'' the networks have become less accessible and less interoperable. © The Author(s) 2011.","actor-network theory; game developers; game development; game industry; inter/intranetwork; NES; nintendo; nintendo entertainment system; video games",,,,,,,,,"Atari Games Corp. and Tengen, Inc. v.

I demonstrate how the public enemy of America's Army is one not confined to any nationality, ethnicity, or political agenda. This marks a significant departure from games such as Conflict: Desert Storm. I argue that the production of this abstract enemy-what I call the ''unreal enemy''-is significantly shaped by a biopolitical system that intertwines the military and electronic entertainment industries. This arrangement delocalizes power, distributing it through a network of institutions and subjects. Throughout, I use ethnographic examples that explore how this abstract enemy has been constructed and juxtaposed against more concrete and personal figures, such as the America's Army Real Heroes, individuals upheld as the embodiment of personal achievement in the U.S. Army. I conclude by asserting that the unreal enemy of America's Army is, ultimately, an enemy that is not exclusive to a video game, but one that exists as an anonymous specter, ever present in the militarized American cultural imaginary. © The Author(s) 2011.","America's Army; anthropology; biopower; enemy; military entertainment complex; US Army; war gaming",,,,,,,,,"Allen, R., The army rolls through Indianapolis: Fieldwork at the virtual army experience (2009) Transformative Works and Cultures, 1. , http://journal.transformativeworks.org/index.php/twc/article/view/80/97; Allen, R., Games without tears, wars without frontiers Magic That Perpetuates War, , IN PRESS.

These types of play, known as out-of-game play or extrinsic play, take place beyond the original game context. Despite their significant contribution to the overall play experience, they are often neglected by the game research community. Conventional game theories such as ludology and narratology do not provide an insightful account of the sociocultural aspects of game play. Therefore, in this article, we report our observations and investigations into different forms of extrinsic play activities in an online virtual setting. Founded on activity theory, we articulate theoretical models that explicate game play in a sociocultural context. Our findings reveal that extrinsic play constitutes reflective play and expansive play, which transform the play activity and transport the players beyond the original boundary of play. © The Author(s) 2010.","activity theory; computer games; extrinsic play; sociocultural play",,,,,,,,,"(2008) Wikipedia, the Free Encyclopaedia, , http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art_of_Fighting, Art of Fighting.

First, they are the shining proponents of cutting edge virtuality, embodying the alluring unreality of something erroneously conceived of existing on the other side of a screen. A second reason for associating games with escapism relates to a common perception of play and games as opposite of seriousness and work and somehow set apart from the ordinary, everyday life. The paper discusses the nature of escapism and relates it to the above theoretical issues which contribute to a view of digital games as inherently escapist. The paper proposes a renewed view on digital games and escapism that takes into account their distinctive qualities and their role in everyday life. © The Author(s) 2010.","engagement; escapism; games; magic circle; real; virtual",,,,,,,,,"Aarseth, E., (1997) Cybertext: Perspectives on Ergodic Literature, , Baltimore, MD: Johns Hopkins University Press; Aarseth, E., Playing research: Methodological approaches to game analysis (2003) Digital Arts and Culture Conference, Melbourne, Australia; Barlow, J.P., Kapor, M., (1990) Across the Electronic Frontier, , http://w2.eff.org/Misc/Publications/John_Perry_Barlow/?f=across_the_ef. article.txt; Beck, J.C., Wade, M., (2004) Got Game: How the Gamer Generation Is Reshaping Business Forever, , Boston, MA: Harvard Business School; (2004) World of Warcraft, , Blizzard, Entertainment.

What does it mean to have a culture defined by the consumption of a particular medium? Moreover, what are the implications of defining this culture in a particular way? While there has been a great deal of ink split on video game culture, the actual definition of the term is often treated as common sense. Unpacking the discourses surrounding ""video game culture"" allows us to see the power dynamics involved in attributing certain characteristics to it, as well as naming it ""video game culture"" as such. This has implications for how video games are studied and is connected with how culture is studied more broadly. By critically examining how video game culture has been defined in both press and academic articles, this paper illuminates how this definition has limited the study of video games and where it can move. © The Author(s) 2010.","cultural studies; discourse; gamer stereotypes; video game culture; video games",,,,,,,,,"Amdur, D., Earth Quake (1996) The Washington Post, pp. R19. , October 30; Ang, I., (1991) Desperately Seeking the Audience, , London: Routledge; Aoyama, Y., Izushi, H., Hardware gimmick or cultural innovation?

The player must grind his or her way through many early levels to reach any kind of decent reward for the hours invested. Compared to films going back to Rocky and television shows such as Crime Scene Investigation (CSI), there is no montage to fast-forward through the work involved in reaching the game's reward. What is it about online games or the player that makes such work so compelling? Why would hard work, something that is often avoided in the daily grind of an 8-5 job, be forced upon the videogame player-often to his or her delight? To address these questions, we use Ian Bogost's concept of unit operations to evaluate the concept that ""hard work is rewarded"" as it relates to various media, including films and videogames, and to analyze the historical and theoretical implications of the concept. © The Author(s) 2010.","American dream; cheating; grind; hard work; MMOG; montage; myth; unit; videogame",,,,,,,,,"Aarseth, E., (1997) Cybertext: Perspectives on Ergodic Literature, , Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins University Press; Aarseth, E., We all want to change the world: The ideology of innovation in digital media (2003) Digital Media Revisited: Theoretical and Conceptual Innovations in Digital Domains, pp. 415-439. , G.

Adopting a discursive approach to the notion of ''art,'' the extent to which traditional formations of cultural value are mobilized is explored across three aspects of the series' first four installments. The Silent Hill game texts are examined as evoking formal devices of art cinema, including realism, ambiguity, psychological complexity, and self-reflexivity. Next the games' advertising is considered as emphasizing these qualities, privileging narrative over ludic gaming aspects. Finally the games' representation in the documentary ""The Making of Silent Hill 2"" is discussed as positioning the series within frameworks of artistry and authorship. © The Author(s) 2010.","advertising; art; cinema; documentary; Silent Hill",,,,,,,,,"Aarseth, E., (1997) Cybertext; Perspectives on Ergodic Literature, , Baltimore, MD: John Hopkins University Press; Aarseth, E., Genre trouble: Narrativism and the art of simulation (2004) First Person: New Media As Story, Performance, and Game, pp. 45-55. , N.

The desert island simulation blends a series of familiar game genres with those of popular television, specifically serial television, to produce a genre that deliberately appeals to non-traditional users (although this definition relies more on preconceptions than actuality, as games continue to develop in scope). This article examines the techniques that these games use, including the shrewd marketing tools of the DS, the ways in which the games borrow from existing games genres, how they draw the player into a narrative web through a reconstruction of player agency, and the linkage with serial television. By specifically examining The Sims 2 Castaway (S2C, 2007), this article discusses how the changing of ludic objectives during these games influences player expectation and how this is increasingly reflected in other texts such as long-haul television series. These developments indicate not only an evolving canon within games but argue for their growing influence elsewhere in cultural production. © The Author(s) 2010.","convergence texts; games studies; Nintendo DS; point and click adventures; Sims Castaway",,,,,,,,,"Abrams, (2004) Lost, , ABC: Bad Robot Productions; Animal crossing, wild world (2007) Amazon Review, , http://www.amazon.co.uk/Animal-Crossing-Wild-World-Nintendo/dp/ B0009Z3MQK/; Barthes, R., (1970) S/Z, , R.

This article takes a look at the attitudes and everyday practices of the people who make game modifications, with special focus on the forms and consequences of collaboration between hobbyists. The case discussed in the article is the shooter-game Operation Flashpoint (OFP) and the modding scene around it. The article proposes that there is no such thing as an average computer game modder. It is suggested that the distinctions can be drawn based on the objective of projects (missions, add-ons, mods), modder motivations (playing, hacking, researching, self-expression, cooperation), and notions on the ownership and potential commercialization of their work. Given the forecasts concerning the growing significance of player-made content, this study can offer some down-to-earth findings from the long established tradition of game modding. © The Author(s) 2010.","computer game modifications; game fans; modding; player production",,,,,,,,,"Abercrombie, N., Longhurst, B., (1998) Audiences: A Sociological Theory of Performance and Imagination, , London: SAGE; Banks, J.A.L., Negotiating participatory culture in the new media environment: Auran and the Trainz online community - An (im)possible relation (2003) Proceedings of the Fifth International Digital Arts and Culture Conference, , May 19-23.

Email: mizukoi@uci.edu The body of work reported on in this special issue represents the first and, so far, only in-depth documentation and analysis of learning and practice in a tween- centered virtual world. Not only does this work take up a population that has been largely invisible in the research on virtual worlds, it also examines an environment that uniquely mediates between the social, recreational, and educational dimensions of kids’ everyday lives. The research project that Kafai and her colleagues have taken on is a rare alliance between the provisioners of a commercial virtual world, educational researchers, and a population of wired kids; this alliance is reflected in both the unique research design and in the practices documented by the work. The papers collected here tell a story of educators, designers, industries, and kids coming together around new kinds of practices and boundary crossings, taking advantage of the emerging palette of learning opportunities on offer in the networked world. As a hybrid online space and a hybrid research project, this work mediates between three boundaries: between childhood and adulthood, between education and entertainment, and between friendship-driven and interest-driven practices. In my comments, I describe the significance of this work in terms of these three boundary crossings. Tweens in the Networked World Research thus far on virtual worlds has focused on populations of adults and youth, and not on younger children. With the exception of Whyville and Neopets, virtual 144 worlds for pre-teens are a relatively recent phenomenon, but one that is clearly growing in significance with the popularity of sites like Club Penguin, Webkins, Build-a-Bearville, Runescape, and Poptropolis. This research on Whyville is a prescient engagement with a growing arena of online practice that was still nascent at the time that the study was conducted. It is a cornerstone of what will become an increasingly important area of study within education and childhood studies and within research on virtual worlds, mediating between these two areas of study. The readership for this journal does not need to be reminded of the research tradition in the study of virtual worlds but may be less familiar with the body of work on children’s play and social life. Research in childhood studies documents the ways in which games and play function as sites of social negotiation and learning (eg. Goodwin, 1995; Ito, 2009; Kafai, 1999; Thorne, 1999). The papers collected here represent an example of work in this tradition, but with a unique focus on networked social life. It is important to underscore the specific challenges and constraints faced by researchers who study children’s everyday practices. Unlike those who work with adults and teens, researchers have to negotiate the usual issues of access and rapport but must also mediate between children and adults. This means acting as translators for the concerns, language, and practice unique to children, as well as managing very practical and thorny issues in research practice as it pertains to a ‘‘protected’’ pop- ulation. Many of the decisions that Kafai and her colleagues made in their research design are clearly keyed to the specifics of the tween demographic, including how they participated in the online space, their careful negotiation of access to log data, and the provisioning of an afterschool space where they could interact with kids in real-life spaces. The relative paucity of research that looks in detail at kids’ everyday practices is tied to the challenges that researchers face in gaining legitimate access to kids’ everyday lives. This body of work on Whyville thus represents an invaluable look into contemporary childhood. The study of online social life enriches our understanding of contemporary childhood in important ways. Children’s growing access to virtual worlds is part of a longer historical trajectory of children gaining access to far-flung networks of information and people. This began with media such as radio and television, and as each new wave of media technology is introduced to children, it has been accom- panied by a set of cultural contestations over the appropriateness of children’s access to it (eg. Buckingham, 1993, 1994; Jenkins, 1998; Kinder, 1999; Kline, 1993; Meyrowitz, 1985; Seiter, 1995). The introduction of computers, video games, and the Internet has introduced a variety of new twists into these longstanding contestations (Buckingham, 2007; Holloway & Valentine, 2003; Ito et al., 2008; Livingstone, 2002; Seiter, 2005). Media such as television, but particularly today’s social online media, introduce children to adult-like forms of agency and participa- tion that were shut off to them in the modern era (Ito et al., 2008, 2009). A virtual world like Whyville is one indicator of the growing capacity of children to reach out to social worlds that are beyond their previously limited spheres of activity. 145 The negotiations between the adult designers and organizers of the site, and the design recommendations that the research team make are all part of this broader struggle to define what are appropriate forms of participation for children in contem- porary media environments. Entertainment Versus Education In addition to mediating between children’s and adults’ worlds, this study of Whyville mediates between the worlds of commercial media and educational agen- das. Whyville’s connection to this research project is part of a longer tradition of work in educational research and development that mobilizes commercial software and recreational play in the service of learning (eg., Cole, 1997; Ito, 2009; Kafai, 1999; Papert, 1996a, 1996b; Vasquez, Pease-Alvarez, & Shannon, 1994). Over the past decades, educational researchers have worked with socially minded technology makers to develop games and virtual worlds that push a learning agenda within a recreational context. The idea of wedding learning and play through gaming media is not new, but this particular instantiation in a tween virtual world represents a unique experiment and set of alliances. In comparison to adult-dominated spaces like World of Warcraft or Second Life, Whyville operates at a smaller (but still massive) scale, with a simpler technology toolkit. Rather than seeing this as a limitation of the site and the research, it is impor- tant to appreciate that the work here ties together research, education, and design; it is part of an intervention and design practice and not simply an effort to document a pervasive and popular gaming phenomenon. Among commercially successful virtual worlds, Whyville is quite unique in having a substantive focus on scientific content. The history of edutainment and learning games demonstrates how difficult it is to successfully develop a consumer-oriented game that contains academic con- tent (Ito, 2009). The relationship that the research team has developed with both the Whyville developers and local kids is an integral part of this positioning between research and practice and between educational and entertainment agendas. In other words, the success of Whyville should not be measured in relation to mainstream commercial games, but rather in relation to a specific genre of games and virtual worlds that bring together agendas of learning and play. Whyville is worth paying attention to as a rare success in this kind of hybrid genre. Peer-Based Learning in Networked Publics As an environment that involves kids’ recreational play, scientific inquiry, and engagement with social issues, Whyville enables kids to crossover between different genres of practice. In a recent study, we found that youth new media practices fell broadly into two genres, friendship-driven or interest-driven participation. Friendship-driven participation was characterized by the kind of everyday socializ- ing and hanging out that pervades sites like MySpace and Facebook, where kids are 146 negotiating issues of status and popularity largely with same-aged peers from school. By contrast, interest-driven participation involves socializing around specific areas of interest and can often lead to more ‘‘geeky’’ and creative pursuits (Ito et al., 2008, 2009). The everyday social exchange on Whyville, with kids developing status and reputation through chat and customized avatars resembles much of what we found in the friendship-driven world. Other activities, such as the development of cheats, inquiry about Whypox, and social mobilization around issues of race and Tater Day, represent a more interest-driven and geeked out mode. Whyville is particularly notable as a space that incorporates and legitimizes both interest-driven and friendship-driven modes of interaction. This makes the site inviting to kids with both kinds of orientations, helping to cross gender divides that often relegate boys to geekier pursuits and girls to more social and aesthetic activities. Environments where kids can move between casual hanging out interaction and more interest-driven and geeked out forms of knowledge exchange and inquiry are in many ways ideal learning environments (Ito et al., 2008, 2009). The online world supports new kinds of networked publics (Varnelis, 2008) where kids congregate and interact around shared areas of interest and learn from peers, both kids or adults. Whether it is a fan fiction community, a game site, a video sharing site, or the hybrid virtual world of Whyville, these networked publics allow for demand-driven and individualized learning that is grounded in peer-based feedback, interaction, and reputation-building. These dynamics are unique to these more infor- mal, social, and recreational spaces, and differ fundamentally from the more explicit instructional contexts that most kids encounter in school. The detailed analysis of Whyville practices presented in this special issue offers rich documentation of how these dynamics unfold as an interaction between the designed affordances of the online world, peer interaction between kids, and adult facilitation. In studying how kids learned to throw mudballs, Fields and Kafai demonstrate how knowledge was developed in a context of peer-based exchange, motivated by social activity. The cases of collective cheat development (Fields and Kafai) and inquiry into Whypox (Kafai, Quintero, & Feldon) also demonstrate some of the unique forms of knowledge construction and exchange enabled by networked peer publics. Not only are kids able to exchange knowledge about a given practice, they are also able to collectively develop new forms of knowledge, and pursue areas of specialization and expertise. In both of these cases, and in the cases of avatar authoring (Kafai, Fields, & Cook) and mobilization on race (Kafai, Fields, & Cook), kids develop reputations as experts and activists in the public sphere of Whyville. Engagement in a public space, where kids can develop visibi- lity, reputation, and authority, becomes a powerful motivator for learning and social action. The papers in this special issue provide us with a set of illustrations of how virtual worlds can offer new drivers for learning that disrupt existing boundaries between adult and kids worlds and between the cultures and practices of education and 147 entertainment. Although research on kids’ participation in virtual worlds is still in its infancy, as the field develops, the cases represented here will link up to a growing empirical corpus of comparable cases, and a set of conceptual and theoretical para- digms that will push us to consider how new online spaces shape contemporary childhood, learning, and play.

Using rhetorical analysis, gaming studies literature, and a critical analysis of welfare discourse, four rhetorical strategies can be seen in the discourse produced by the playing community. From directly confronting Tigole's statements to lamenting a loss of avatar capital and analyzing the role the changes have on the multiplayer aspects of the game, the rhetoric of ""welfare"" epics offers unique insights into the importance of balance and scarcity in the normative structures of WoW, how players accept and perpetuate the belief that rewards in online games should be ""earned,"" and how WoW's system of rewards has been fundamentally altered since the game's launch. © The Author(s) 2010.","PvP; Raiding; Reward systems; Rhetoric; Welfare epics; World of warcraft",,,,,,,,,"Bartle, R., Hearts, clubs, diamonds, spades: Players who suit MUDS (1997) The Journal of Virtual Environments, 1. , http://www.brandeis.edu/pubs/jove/HTML/v1/bartle.html; (2007) Status Symbols and Why You Play WoW, , http://elitistjerks.com/f15/t17374-status_symbols_why_you_play_wow/, Bazazu.

However, there are three main barriers to advancing understanding of games' potential for civic education: the current practices of formal schooling, a dearth of evidence about what kinds of games best inspire learning about public life, and divergent paradigms of civic engagement. In response, this article develops a conceptual framework for how games might foster civic learning of many kinds. The authors hypothesize that the most effective games for civic learning will be those that best integrate game play and content, that help players make connections between their individual actions and larger social structures, and that link ethical and expedient reasoning. This framework suggests an agenda for game design and research that could illuminate whether and how games can be most fruitfully incorporated into training and education for democratic citizenship and civic leadership. © The Author(s) 2010.","Agency; Citizenship; Civic; Ethics; Games; Leadership; Politics",,,,,,,,,"Allen, M.J., (2006) Assessing General Education Programs, , Bolton, MA: Anker Publishing; Aristotle, (1962) The Politics, , 323 B.C.

We use a new integrative approach called connective ethnography that focuses on how a gaming practice spread across a network of youth at an after school club that simultaneously participated in a virtual world, Whyville.net. To trace youth participation in online and offline social contexts, we draw on multiple sources of information: observations, interviews, videos, online tracking and chat data, and hundreds of hours of play in Whyville ourselves. One gaming practice - the throwing of projectiles and its social uses and nuances - became the focal point of our analyses. The discussions address the methodological challenges underlying the synthesis of diverse types of data that allowed us to follow youth across multiple spaces as well as initial insights into how this practice was used to negotiate relationships in multiple spaces through play. © The Author(s) 2010.","Ethnography; Insider knowledge; Social practices; Tracking data; Tweens; Virtual worlds",,,,,,,,,"Barab, S.A., Thomas, M., Dodge, T., Carteaux, R., Tuzun, H., Making learning fun: Quest Atlantis, a game without guns (2005) Educational Technology Research and Development, 53, pp. 86-107; Beavis, C., Nixon, H., Atkinson, S., LAN cafes: Cafes, places of gathering, or sites if informal teaching and learning?

This paper focuses on one virtual world, called Whyville.net, which at the time of our study hosted over 1.2 million players ages 8 to16 years, with the average player 12.3 years old. Girls represent over 68% of all players. A guided tour to the various places in Whyville, the different types of science games, and the range of players' activities provides insights into what players talk about, with whom they socialize, what they like to play, and how they engage in investigations. In 2005, a group of researchers set out to study Whyville by recruiting hundreds of participants online and offline in classrooms and after school clubs and by conducting observations, surveys, and interviews about their online activities. In addition, we collected log files that captured their online movements and chat interaction during a six month period. We discuss ethical issues of conducting research as adults in tween virtual communities and limitations of capturing the complexities of interactions simultaneously in online and offline spaces. The paper concludes with an overview of following papers in the special issue that cover players' avatar designs, representation of race, cheating practices, learning how to throw virtual mudballs, and participation in virtual epidemic. © The Author(s) 2010.","Learning; Race; Science; Teen; Virtual worlds",,,,,,,,,"Aschbacher, P.R., (2003) Gender Differences in the Perception and Use of An Informal Science Learning Web Site: Final Project Report to the National Science Foundation, , Pasadena: California Institute of Technology; Boellstorff, T., (2008) Coming of Age in Second Life: An Anthropologist Explores the Virtually Human, , NJ Princeton University Press; Boyd, D., (2006) Identity Productions in a Networked Culture: Why Youth Heart MySpace, , http://www.danah.org/papers/AAAS2006.html, American Association for the Advancement of Science, St. Louis, MO.

One unique feature of Whyville is the player's ability to customize their avatars with various face parts and accessories, all designed and sold by other players in Whyville. Our findings report on the racial diversity of available resources for avatar construction and online postings about the role of race in avatar design and social interactions in the community. With the growing interest in player-generated content for online worlds such as Teen Second Life, our discussion addresses the role of avatars in teen/tween identity development and self-representation, and the role of virtual entrepreneurs and community activists in increasing the diversity of avatar parts available. © The Author(s) 2010.","Adolescent development; Avatar; Identity; Participatory culture; Race; Tweens; Virtual world",,,,,,,,,"Salen, Zimmerman, E.A.-B.K., Bow, nigger (2005) The Game Design Reader, pp. 602-608. , Cambridge, MA: The MIT Press; Prejudice: Not only race (2003) The Whyville Times, , Anonymous Retrieved February 27, 2007, from Whyville.net; In a Latina's shoes (2005) The Whyville Times, , Artista Retrieved February 27, 2007, from Whyville.net; It's the inside that counts (2002) The Whyville Times, , Bluegirl7.

Cheat sites are a continuation of game communities where players engage in knowledge building about game related challenges. In this paper we analyze the cheat sites created by players for a tween virtual world called Whyville.net, which encourages youth to participate in a range of social activities and play casual science games. Through analysis we created typologies for both the cheats and sites related to science content. Further, a case study of an exemplary cheat site elaborates on how some player-generated sites work to build knowledge of Whyville. Finally, investigation of over a hundred player-written articles illuminates how Whyvillians contest different practices of cheating and how cheating affects the virtual world. Implications of these findings as cultural artifacts of the game community and as guides for designing informal online learning activities are discussed. © The Author(s) 2010.","Cheating; Cheats; Ethics; Knowledge building; Learning; Science; Tweens; Virtual worlds",,,,,,,,,"Aschbacher, P.R., (2003) Gender Differences in the Perception and Use of An Informal Science Learning Web Site, , Final Project Report to the National Science Foundation.

A number of scholars have recently begun to forge an approach distinct from past efforts, shifting their attention toward broader, contextual understandings of games, communities, and play. Seeking to treat such spaces neither as wholly determined by outside factors nor as utterly sui generis, they aim to account for the contingent and emergent relationship that these spaces have with other domains of human experience. virtual worlds games game studies methodology pragmatism interdisciplinarity Abstract In doing so, these scholars have taken up the study of virtual worlds in relation to law, anthropology, economics, cultural studies, communication, network analysis, literature, sociology, and political economy (to name a few). When viewed as a whole, the work of these scholars shows a new perspective beginning to emerge. While neither discounting the power of narrative nor the structure of rule-based play, they seek to ground our understandings of games in the practices of players and developers as well as the broader array of other constraints and systems of meaning within which they are historically embedded. 1 University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, Wisconsin 2 Swarthmore College, Swarthmore, Pennyslyvania Corresponding author: Timothy Burke, Swarthmore College, 500 College Avenue, Swarthmore, PA 19081. E-mail: tburke1@swarthmore.edu 324 This special issue is a collection of such work. It may strike some readers as diverse in both its articles’ topics and their theoretical orientation, but here we sug- gest that such diversity is grounded in a common pragmatist outlook. This outlook entails a commitment to the processual and emergent quality of social life and is pragmatic as well in its critical stance toward confidently transcendent accounts and in its interest toward the new possibilities of a specifically protean medium. What unites these approaches is, first and foremost, an ecumenical appreciation of the complexity and range of forces at work and the need to tap the wisdom of a wide array of fields’ approaches and methodologies. Coupled with that is a unifying thread that focuses all of these approaches on a central question: What happens at the intersection of practice, meaning, and community within these persistent, complex, and open-ended domains for action? This research is beginning to produce scholarly inquiry into the relationships among and between virtual worlds and the areas of civic engagement, education, governance and law, community action, politics and protest, and economic systems to name a few. In all of this work, there is a common interest in the growing stakes of virtual worlds, including most famously their genuine markets and also their increas- ing viability as sites for learning, therapy, and belonging itself. At the same time, the scholars and other thinkers involved must navigate a difficult interdisciplinary ter- rain, one that is only becoming more so as interest in games and virtual worlds con- tinues to rise. Professional success in academic life often involves establishing a reputation for originality in choice of subject matter, in methodology, or in formulating theory or hypotheses. This principle drives most disciplines toward novelty and ensures the steady emergence of new areas of study, new fields, and sometimes even new dis- ciplines. Sometimes this novelty is driven by the emergence of some new phenom- enon in the world and sometimes by a new approach to an established subject. Frequently, new areas of academic research are formulated within strongly disci- plinary paradigms. Even when several disciplines simultaneously focus on a new area of study, their understanding of that topic may diverge so far as to prevent researchers in different disciplines from recognizing a convergence of interests. At such a moment, individual researchers who choose to bridge the disciplinary gap and combine approaches from many fields may face a variety of institutional obsta- cles and find it difficult to get scholarly traction in disseminating their work. Occasionally, however, a new area of scholarly inquiry draws researchers together across disciplinary barriers, rewarding more eclectic and generalist modes of inquiry. The study of games in general, and digitally mediated games in particu- lar, strikes us as being one of the premiere examples of this kind of academic con- vergence in the last three decades. One of the striking things about many recent academic workshops, conferences, and meetings devoted to the study of play, digital games, virtual worlds, and related topics is the range of disciplines represented and the relatively low barriers to inter- disciplinary conversation, both in formal and informal terms. This is not to say that 325 the scholarly study of games is without its tensions. The articles in this collection in their very variety of approach testify to the always-present possibility that ecumen- ism will fade in favor of sectarianism. Nevertheless, there is an open, inventive spirit that surrounds the study of games and virtual worlds at the moment, suffused with a pragmatism about methodology, data, and argument. Perhaps a bit of this pragmatic attitude stems from the subject of study itself. Games and play have long stimulated intricate philosophical and theoretical musings that stem in part from the difficulties they pose to more diagrammatic, narrowly functional descriptions of human societies. At the same time, that very difficulty also produced an openness and eclecticism in the study of games, while even before the relative conformism of contemporary professional academia, the definitional con- nection between games and ‘‘fun’’—their signature absence of ‘‘seriousness’’— often kept intellectuals from paying too much attention to them as a subject. Even more than games in general, the empirical character of virtual worlds demands a multidisciplinary, methodologically polymorphous approach. Research on virtual worlds almost inevitably has to combine the interpretation of a media form with attention to the sociology of players outside the game and the sociality of play- ers within a virtual world, along with the synthetic and digitized nature of the world’s architecture itself, with novel demands on any given discipline’s conven- tional methods of research. However, we also believe that some of the relaxed interdisciplinarity visible in the study of games is an epiphenomenal consequence of the generational and intel- lectual background of the scholars most likely to be studying them. No matter what the home discipline of a scholar involved in games research, working on games is an anxious prospect that often inclines one sympathetically to others who have taken a similar risk. Moreover, the informational and intellectual habitus of digital culture, where much games research is heavily vested, tends to push scholars toward colla- boration while often obscuring some of the disciplinary markers of identity that sep- arate researchers working on other topics. We strongly believe that this is a desirable condition for games research that has already produced a body of scholarly work whose strength partially derives from its easy, natural interdisciplinarity and its methodological inventiveness, and that in this respect the academic study of games in the past decade suggests a broader kind of generativity or productivity possible in much scholarly research on human sociality, behavior, and culture. In this way, the study of games may fill out a part of the social theoretical landscape that has regularly bedeviled and fascinated social theorists but remained largely uncharted. Whatever the legacy of the study of games for thought in general, the more prac- tical question is whether this pragmatic, eclectic approach to research is sustainable in the long-term. We fear that the answer is, ‘‘probably not’’, for several reasons. First, there are serious efforts being made to institutionalize academic work on games as a discipline or quasidiscipline in its own right. This is a common response with any new subject or methodological approach that draws scholars away from the 326 norms of their home disciplines. On one level, this is a normal part of the life cycle of academic careers. As scholars establish a body of work and gain legitimacy, they are often asked to participate in the governance and expansion of universities, sometimes recruited with that specific intent. An institute or program at one institution often natu- rally works to extend its authority or influence horizontally across a wider domain, and the easiest way to do so is through the familiar mechanisms of disciplinarity. The move toward disciplinarity is also a sound strategy for managing risks incurred by games researchers. It is one thing to declare an interest in studying games or virtual worlds if you are a tenured professor already comfortably placed in a traditional discipline and another thing entirely to undertake such research as a defining act at the beginning of one’s career, in a fully interdisciplinary manner. For those of us who have graduate students, we know that it is irresponsible to invite them to do this kind of research unless there are programs, departments, or institutes which understand and accept the interdisciplinary study of games as a legitimate intellectual project ready to receive and employ them. If such work is undertaken and legitimated within an established discipline, then to some extent its interdisci- plinarity needs to be strategically de-emphasized during the formulation of a disser- tation project. If it is undertaken by graduate students and junior researchers in the pragmatically ‘‘open’’ manner that we prefer, then that pragmatism needs institutio- nalization, and the path of least resistance toward that goal is the formation of a new discipline. The move to disciplinarity is also one of the subtle underpinnings beneath the so- called ludology-narratology debate, in that many of the scholars identified with the formalist methods of ludology have also argued for the disciplinary formalization of the field, and many of the scholars indifferent to or opposed to ludological criticism have tended to be more interested in ‘‘permanent interdisciplinarity.’’ For the moment, in the American academy, any movement toward ‘‘game studies’’ as a qua- sidisciplinary project seems to have stalled, but the logic of such a move is real and will doubtless continue to exert pressure on researchers. The second reason we suspect that an open spirit of methodological and disciplin- ary pragmatism may be hard to maintain is competition for money. In 1998, with a few notable exceptions, scholars interested in researching games supported their work through whatever ordinary sources faculty at their institution or in their discipline might have been able to call upon. In 2008, there are a number of sources of generous funding for research specifically devoted to games or digital culture. Even when the funding agencies themselves are fairly open-ended in their support for such work, competition for funding inevitably pushes researchers to stress the distinctiveness of their own proposals. One natural way to distinguish oneself from others is by stressing the disciplinary or methodological gap between one’s own proposal and the work of others. More importantly, many of the new sources of research support approach the study of games or virtual worlds with their own established preferences, often for work that can be rigorously quantified or that has ready or obvious applications to difficult policy problems beyond games or virtual worlds themselves. 327 Even if these pressures were countered, there is simply the fact that the pragma- tism and eclecticism of current games researchers is largely an accidental, emergent attitude produced out of many convergent journeys toward the study of games. There may be no way to secure what is by nature ephemeral. It seems best, then, that we enjoy the intellectual dispensation of the present moment for however long it holds true. Conventional struggles over quantitative versus qualitative methodologies strike us as unrewarding in general, and especially around this subject. Exclusive preference for one style or mode of reading or interpreting games and virtual worlds (such as ludological formalism) seems equally unrewarding, not that any scholar seems any longer to argue on behalf of such exclusivity. So what are the meaningful points of interest within the study of game culture and practice? Pragmatism does not mean uniformity, after all. It seems to us that the essays in this volume underscore some of the more important possible issues to be pursued under the sign of a ‘‘prag- matic’’ game studies, as well as some shared challenges. The challenges are more obvious. Whatever the intended approach or argument, research on commercial games has to negotiate serious barriers of access and con- sciously consider how or whether to pursue methodological approaches that might be second nature in other contexts. For example, while anthropologists may self- reflexively problematize fieldwork and ethnography when beginning (and conclud- ing) work in a community in the ‘‘real world,’’ rarely will an anthropologist face a completely open-ended question about whether ethnography of any kind should be used or have to reinvent ethnographic study as a largely novel object. To some extent, however, virtual worlds and digital games do provoke such a self- conscious consideration of both methodological and epistemological problems, regardless of the home discipline of a researcher. Core issues within game studies are represented here as well. The one that most noticeably marks all of the articles herein concerns the degree to which games are distinctive: How special are they or how ordinary? Extreme answers in either direc- tion stand as grand temptations for the field of game studies as it contemplates dis- ciplinarity. If games are so distinctive in the way they shape sociality, or cognition, or engender experience as to require specialized language and tools, then an institu- tional existence becomes the only way to protect and promote their study (even if this specialization opens the door to its own marginalization in the grand scheme of things). This is disciplinarity on the small, topical scale. If, however, games are held up as providing the essential metaphor for human experience writ large, then disciplinarity becomes the institutional gambit for a much more ambitious carving out of territory from the academy—reflecting a claim to timeless significance on a par with the most established of traditional academic disciplines. The articles in this issue handle the distinctiveness of games and virtual worlds in a different way. Their answer to the distinctiveness question seems to be ‘‘distinctive enough’’; that is, distinctive enough to get certain kids of work done, whether it is work by players, by institutions, by policy makers, or by researchers themselves. The common thread here is an awareness that the degree to which these social actors 328 achieve some carving out of a game or virtual world for certain purposes is in each case a situated cultural accomplishment; it is, in short, a historically located and con- tingent act. In taking this approach, the researchers here take an issue that can so eas- ily be made to serve the aims of disciplinary gambits, as above, and instead treat it as one of the most important things to study about games and virtual worlds as they unfold. T. L. Taylor, in the first article, pushes this even further by charting how code itself, in the form of certain ‘‘mods’’ (modifications—third-party software used by players of massively multiplayer online games [MMOGs] while they play), can come to be another actor on the scene of gameplay, part of a assemblage of factors that include but are not reducible to human agency. In proposing that we take the interrelation of code, players, and other factors seriously in our explorations of MMOGs, Taylor decenters the game player, the game maker, and the game as a for- mal object. For this work, it is the specifically digital features of current games that opens distinctive and provocative possibilities for conceiving of agency within them. The article by Julian Kücklich confronts the issue of distinctiveness head on by identifying the ways in which MMOGs are suffused both with claims about being ‘‘outside’’ the real world and with all-too familiar constructions of territory and pop- ulation that become linked to an ideology of playfulness. For Kücklich, the highly networked nature of virtual worlds allows for a distinctive ‘‘mode of production that can also be discerned in the real world, but which has not yet achieved a comparable level of integration between the economic, the social, the cultural, and the political’’ [340–352]. Given that labor within these spaces is represented as play, however, Kücklich argues that the form of sovereignty established by the makers of such worlds is notably precarious. Kücklich traces a path toward the development of political subjectivities in MMOGs, and Mark Silverman and Bart Simon are similarly interested in how sub- jects are created in such spaces. Their path takes them through the development of economic subjectivities. Moving beyond accounts of player involvement in in-game institutions (guilds) that assume players are individualist economic actors a priori, they ask how the loot distribution system of dragon kill points (DKP) in such games actually turns players into such economic actors. For them, the interesting question is ‘‘how DKP functions to produce a player-subject who is analyzable in terms of the economics of commitment’’ [353–378]. However, they press further and conclude by provocatively asking whether such ‘‘hyperworkers’’ end up as, ironically, singu- larly unproductive subjects in the context of late capitalism. We note here how the pieces of both Kücklich and Silverman/Simon point ultimately toward a reversal of sorts, with sovereignty precarious and labor unproductive. While similarly interested in what happens when an entrenched system of govern- ance meets the distinctive affordances of virtual worlds, Greg Lastowka, in the next article, asks more directly what lawmakers and judges should do about this clash. He suggests that the vast cultural accomplishment, that is the law can find a reason, con- sistent with its long trajectory of thinking, for reaching an accommodation with 329 games. His pragmatic recommendation is for the law to recognize how games them- selves can powerfully reshape the expectations of their players, even to the point of refiguring the constraints and affordances that surround them. For much the same reasons that led Kücklich and Silverman/Simon to identify games as powerful sha- pers of subjectivity, Lastowka argues that the law would be best served by avoiding a leap to eliminating any distinctiveness for games, an approach that would lead to legal decisions trumping gaming experience. Instead, he argues that games are another domain in which governance is culturally accomplished. The project of find- ing a useful point of accommodation between legalistic rules and games for the pur- poses of legislative and judicial policy recommendations prompts deep reconsiderations both of the limits of the law and of the grounds for seeing games as, in a way, policy-generating entities themselves. For Edward Castronova and Matthew Falk, the relative distinctiveness of virtual worlds becomes the grounds for recommending a methodological initiative, one that will take advantage of their complexity, their persistence, and their synthetic nature to forge significant macrolevel social science experiments. The way virtual worlds are simultaneously contrived (and therefore open to narrow and precise adjustments in background conditions) and persistent spaces with an enormous range of affor- dances opens new possibilities for experimental research, with attendant methodo- logical challenges. Recognizing that no experiment achieves perfect replicability, they suggest that virtual worlds can be the site for macrolevel experimentation oth- erwise unfeasible. Virtual worlds are distinctive enough to be the site for experi- ments that can generate not transcendent laws but reliable claims themselves in dialogue with those made through other research methodologies. Here, then, the social actors that must make a pragmatic judgment about the relative separability of virtual worlds are not the players, or the game makers, or policy makers. Nor are they the guilds or other in-game institutions. They are the researchers themselves, who can recognize in virtual worlds an opportunity to pursue experimental research that is pragmatic rather than positivist. A fitting conclusion to these articles is to be found in the article by Mia Consalvo, who tackles a long-held and deeply entrenched concept from game studies concern- ing specifically the distinctiveness of game spaces: the magic circle. What she finds is that, when situated against broader concepts from the study of social forms, the magic circle reveals itself as neither wrong nor right but rather not useful. That is, instead of arguing for a competing and similarly transcendent term, Consalvo seeks to connect the special problems and concerns of games to existing social theory in a way that illuminates both. These contributions demonstrate that a pragmatic, eclectic approach to the disci- plinary and methodological composition of game studies does not preclude mean- ingful, potent disagreements about the substance and meaning of practice within virtual worlds. In particular, we note a difference between approaches to virtual worlds that begin from within those gameworlds and those that approach virtual worlds from a point of intellectual and philosophical origin very far outside of them. 330 We also believe that the contributions to this volume suggest that first and fore- most, the study of games and virtual worlds may teach us less about the world or games and more about the folly of a particular orientation toward the production of social science. None of the conversations that are enjoined in this issue are con- versations finished by the perfected collection of more data, even those that argue for the comprehensive use of virtual worlds as instruments to create data. They are con- versations fulfilled by (but never definitively ended through) interpretation, use, the instrumentality of our research, through posing questions about what we think the human world as a whole is for and what it can or should become. This, we suggest, should not just be the basic intellectual contract behind game studies, whatever that is and might yet be, but behind all scholarly study of human societies.

Still, most of the interview partners successfully manage to combine occupational and private duties with their gaming activities. © 2009 SAGE Publications.","Adult gamers; Everyday game use; Gaming careers; Qualitative interview study; Social gaming",,,,,,,,,"Carnagey, N.L., Anderson, C.A., The effects of reward and punishment in violent video games on aggressive affect, cognition, and behaviour (2005) Psychological Science, 16, pp. 882-889; Crandall, R.W., Sidak, J.G., (2006) Video games.

Although Counter-Strike at first may seem an unsophisticated pursuit, players display remarkable dexterity developed through many hours of play. Through participating in the game and analyzing videos of gameplay, we examine Counter-Strike as an example of expert technology use. As players move beyond the mere physical prowess of chaining their movements with the environment, they develop a sense of the terrain of play as a contingent tactically oriented understanding, rather than as static spatial knowledge. Relatedly, we provide the beginnings of an alternative account of both games and expertise which brings out something of what it is to play a specific game, as opposed to games in general. Moreover, rather than presenting a disengaged general model of skill, the article considers how we might access and describe the situated skills of gameplay. © 2009 The Author(s).","Counter-Strike; Ethnomethodology; Expertise; Interaction; Phenomenology",,,,,,,,,"Atkinson, J.M., Public Speaking and Audience Response: Some Techniques for Inviting Applause (1984) Structures of Social Action, pp. 370-409. , J.

It addresses how members of the video game industry account for the relative lack of GLBT representation in this medium. Previous studies have shown that certain stakeholders actively invest in GLBT representation in media. Factors in the inclusion of GLBT content include (a) the presence of motivated producers in the industry, those that are personally, politically, or commercially interested in GLBT content; (b) how the audience for a text or medium is constructed; (c) what the public backlash from both the GLBT community and conservative groups will be, as well as industry-based reprisals in the form of censorship or ratings; (d) the structure of the industry and how it is funded; and (e) how homosexuality, bisexuality, or transgender identities can be represented in the medium. © 2009 The Author(s).","Cultural production; Gay; Lesbian bisexual and transgender representation; Video games",,,,,,,,,"Aaron, M., (2004) New Queer Cinema: A Critical Reader, , New Brunswick, NJ: Rutgers University Press; Alwood, E., (1996) Straight News: Gays, Lesbians, and the News Media, , New York: Columbia University Press; Barton, M.D., (2004) Gay Characters in Video Games, , http://www.armchairarcade.com/aamain/content.php?article.27, Armchair Arcade.

Complementing existing scholarship on ideologies, practices, and subject positions inculcated by the game, this article interrogates the very conception of subjectivity Civilization fosters in players. Building upon ludological and cybernetic principles, the author takes a formal approach to analyze the processes of humanĝ€""computer interaction that emerge in the course of players' engagement with the game. Characteristics of the turn-based genre as well as Civilization's interface mechanics, representations of historical processes, and manual are considered for the ways in which they solicit player input. The author contends that player interaction with Civilization reifies a conception of himself or herself as a sovereign agent constituted of pure internality. © 2009 The Author(s).","Cogito; Computer games; Interaction; Sid Meier's Civilization; Subjectivity",,,,,,,,,"Aarseth, E.J., (1997) Cybertext: Perspective on Ergodic Literature, , Baltimore: John's Hopkins University Press; Aarseth, E.J., Computer game studies, year one [Online] (2001) Game Studies, p. 1. , http://www.gamestudies.org/0101/, Retrieved September 12; Abbott, H.P., (2002) The Cambridge Introduction to Narrative, , New York: Cambridge University Press; Becker, S., Rhetorical Studies for the Contemporary World (1971) The Prospect of Rhetoric, pp. 21-43. , E.

Yet, this ''independence'' is something quite different from what the literature on independent, alternative, oppositional, radical, or otherwise nonmainstream media tends to suggest or advocate. The contemporary context of game design and development practices throughout the industry forces us to rethink assumptions about independence and autonomy in creative labor, about the communicative practices between media companies across the entire business spectrum of the global media industry, and about diversity or homogeneity in the production of culture.

The end-game consists of complex encounters requiring highly organized groups (raids). This complexity has caused the organizing of raiding guilds (self-governing player communities). Raiding guilds have hierarchical political structures in which leaders must legitimate their positions to demand participation. In a symbiotic relationship of political structure and individual desire, guilds must guarantee advancement in tandem with individuals' acquisition of items (loot); but game mechanics make this problematic. Each end-game encounter defeated offers less loot than players needed. To compensate for this raiding guilds use DKP (intra-guild economic systems). It is DKP, I argue, that generates the political cohesion necessary for guilds to successfully engage the end-game. DKP is guild specific, but important for its effects on value and reciprocity. It creates player obligation through a rationalized system measuring commitment. © 2009 The Author(s).","DKP; Guilds; MMORPG; Reciprocity; Value",,,,,,,,,"Bourdieu, P., The Forms of Capital (1986) Handbook of Theory and Research in the Sociology of Education, pp. 241-258. , J.

It argues the need for videogame studies to develop a more rigorous and focused perspective on the theorization of technology as it relates to research into games and culture. The ""and"" in games and culture cannot begin to be understood comprehensively without a thinking of the profound reliance of both terms on technology. Players and their cultural and collective involvements should be taken not as stable categories of research and development but as processes of becoming intertwined with lineages of technological development and disjunction which are the condition of these processes. Video games are not the least component and proponent of these technological lineages today. The essays collected in this section of the journal issue are described and characterized as offering such a focus on ludic technicity through their diverse but intersecting considerations of game hardware, software, game play, and other practices appropriating game technologies. © 2009 SAGE Publications.","Technicity; Technology; Video game studies",,,,,,,,,"Aarseth, E., (1997) Cybertext: Perspectives on Ergodic Literature, , Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press; Bogost, I., (2006) Unit Operations: An Approach to Videogame Criticism, , Cambridge: MIT Press; De Mul, J., The game of life: Narrative and ludic identity formation in computer games (2005) Handbook of Computer Game Studies, pp. 251-266. , J.

It starts from the premise that aesthetic form, perhaps the central category of modernist critical theory, is present in our play with computer games. The central argument is that controllers and our use of them are repressed in gameplay and that this repression facilitates a diversion of the player's energy that helps explain the compulsive nature of good games. Our sense of participation in events in game fiction is bought at the price of a loss of interest in our hands. The smooth integration of players into the rough, faltering world of gameplay is made possible by an excess of energy that passes from the unacknowledged tension in the hand into the imaginary relation we have with on-screen action. © 2009 SAGE Publications.","Benjamin; Controller; Focillon; Form; Hand",,,,,,,,,"Adorno, T.W., (1966) Aesthetic Theory, , London: Continuum.

Contemporary fantasy massively multiplayer online role-playing games (MMORPGs) privilege whiteness and contextualize it as the default selection, rendering any alterations in coloration or racial selection exotic stylistic deviations. Given the Eurocentrism inherent in the fantasy genre and embraced by MMORPGs, in conjunction with commonsense conceptions of Blacks as hyper-masculine and ghettoized in the gamer imaginary, players and designers do not see blackness as appropriate for the discourse of heroic fantasy.

It focused on sustaining and building player relationships and learning together rather than the accepted norm of obtaining magical items.

The group's ability to reflect and be consistent about its desires for camaraderie allowed it to recover from a poor performing night, which threatened to disband the group.

It can be viewed from multiple perspectives, for example, the time of the playing of the game or the flow of time in a game world. In this article, a comprehensive game time model based on empirical research as well as recent theory is presented. It proposes various perspectives on game time and integrates them to allow coherent representation of the same events in the different perspectives. The model has been tested across tabletop and digital formats, and its applicability across game formats is demonstrated. Emphasis is placed on multiplayer and massively multiplayer role-playing games because these feature complex game time behavior not previously evaluated. The model considers game time as an interactively created and nonlinear feature of games and game play. © 2009 SAGE Publications.","Game; Game speed; Game world; Mapping; Playing game; Role; Time; Time layer; Viewpoints of time",,,,,,,,,"Aarseth, E., (1997) Cybertext: Perspectives on Ergodic Literature, , Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press; Bartle, R., (2003) Designing Virtual Worlds, , Berkeley, CA: New Riders Games; Bettner, P., Terrano, M., (2001) GDC 2001: 1500 Archers on A 28.8: Network Programming in Age of Empires and beyond, , http://www.gamasutra.com/features/20010322/terrano-01.htm; Bockman, P., Hutchison, R., (2005) Dissecting LARP.

Drawing on user-created mods (modifications) in the game World of Warcraft and an analysis of a raid encounter there, a discussion is undertaken about the relationship between technological artifacts, game experience, and sociality. Primary to the consideration is an argument for the centralizing the interrelation of a variety of actors and nodes when analyzing lived play in computer games.","Actor network theory; Assemblage; Massively multiplayer online game; Methodology; Mods",,,,,,,,,"Aarseth, E., (1997) Cybertext: Perspectives on Ergodic Literature, , Baltimore, MD: The Johns Hopkins University Press; Akrich, M., User representations: Practices, methods and sociology (1995) Managing technology in society: The approach of constructive technology assessment, , A.

This study finds that players use their own experiences and knowledge to interpret the game-they do not passively receive the games' images and content. The meanings they produce about controversial subjects are situated in players' local practices, identities, and discourse models as they interact with the game's semiotic domain. The results suggest that scholars need to study players in naturalistic settings if they want to see what ""effects"" games are having on players. © 2008 Sage Publications.","Media; Race; Videogames; Violence; Youth",,,,,,,,,"Aarseth, E., (1997) Cybertext: Perspectives on Ergodic Literature, , Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press; (2000) Violent Video Games Can Increase Aggression, , http://www.apa.org/releases/videogames.html, April 23 Retrieved February 4, 2007, from the American Psychological Association Web site; Anderson, C.A., Berkowitz, L., Donnerstein, E., Huesmann, R.L., Johnson, J.D., Linz, D., The influence of media violence on youth (2003) Psychological Science in the Public Interest, 4 (3), pp. 81-110; Anderson, C.A., Carnagey, N.L., Violent evil and the general aggression model (2004) The Social Psychology of Good and Evil, pp. 168-192. , A.

These topical developments have considerable technosocial bearing and consequence. The tension between the virtual and the actual resides at the heart of topical debates about the modalities of co-presence in mobile telephony. The potential loss of anonymity in location-based mobile gaming and the increasing awareness that mobile games are mostly played at home add considerable complexity to the already-blurred boundaries of physical and virtual co-presence. The micronarratives of such newly configured and articulated social tropes arguably need to be incorporated into macroperspectives on convergence culture if only to invest the latter with additional levels of nuance and complexity. Japanese mobile gaming therefore has strategic utility in this article as a situated context for analyzing the localized cultural politics of convergence and connectivity in mobile telephony. © 2008 SAGE Publications.","Connectivity; Convergence; Cross-media; Japan; Mobile games",,,,,,,,,"Bell, M., Chalmers, M., Barkhuus, L., Hall, M., Sherwood, S., Tennent, P., Interweaving mobile games with everyday life (2006) Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems, pp. 417-426. , New York: ACM Press; Bolter, J., Grusin, R., (1999) Remediation: Understanding new media, , Cambridge, MA: MIT Press; Burns, S., (2006) Japan hooked on mobile games, vnunet.com, , http://www.computing.co.uk/vnunet/news/2155843/japan-hooked-mobile-games, May 11 Retrieved January 15, 2007; Chan, D., Negotiating intra-Asian games networks: On cultural proximity, East Asian games design, and Chinese farmers (2006) Fibreculture, p. 8. , http://journal.fibreculture.org/issue8/issue8_chan.html, Retrieved August 2, 2007; Collier, D., Mobile games: Trends from Japan (2003) PowerPoint presentation at Game Developers Conference, , http://www.gamasutra.com/gdce2003/david_collier.pdf, March, San Jose, CA.

Through an analysis of media reportage, interview transcripts, and chat rooms, a preliminary account of the origins of contemporary Chinese concerns with Internet addiction is provided. This approach differs from biomedical models, which see Internet suicide as a form of mental illness, similar to drug or gambling addiction. This approach draws on anthropological and sociological models of the cultural construction of social problems and argues that concerns with Internet addiction are part of a more general moral crisis faced by Chinese, in response to rapid consumerism, the medicalization of mental illness, and new forms of public and publicity. © 2008 SAGE Publications.","China; Consumerism; Internet addiction; MMOG; Popular culture; Suicide",,,,,,,,,"Allison, A., (2006) Millennial monsters: Japanese toys and the global imagination, , Berkeley: University of California Press; (2000) Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders, , American Psychiatric Association, 4th ed, text rev, Washington, DC: Author; Barker, M., Petley, J., (1997) Ill effects: The media/violence debate, , New York: Routledge; Barme, G., Ye, S., The great firewall of China (1997) Wired Magazine, , http://www.wired.com/wired/5.06/china_pr.html, June, Retrieved September 1, 2007; Boyer, P.S., (1978) Urban masses and moral order in America, pp. 1820-1920. , Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press; Cha, A.E., In China, stern treatment for young Internet addicts (2007) Washington Post, pp. A01; Chen, N., Translating psychiatry and mental health in twentieth-century China (1999) Tokens of exchange: The problem of translation in global circulations, pp. 305-327. , L.

The authors introduce the notion of gameplay segmentation to capture the role that design elements such as level, boss, and wave play in videogames and identify three modes of segmentation. Temporal segmentation limits, synchronizes, and/or coordinates player activity over time. Spatial segmentation breaks the game's virtual space into sublocations. Challenge segmentation presents the player with a sequence of self-contained challenges. The authors describe each mode, and additional submodes, by analyzing vintage arcade games. The analyses illustrate how these games represent a ""primordial soup"" in which many current game design conventions were first explored. Their simplicity provides the authors with access to the original ""building blocks"" of videogames, thus allowing them to develop a rich vocabulary for the discussion. © 2008 SAGE Publications.","Arcade; Game analysis; Game ontology; Gameplay; Videogames",,,,,,,,,"(1980) Phoenix Hialeah, , FL: Centuri Amstar; Atari, (1972) Pong, , Sunnyvale, CA: Author; Atari, (1979) Asteroids, , Sunnyvale, CA: Author; Atari, (1979) Asteroids: Operation, maintenance and service manual, , Sunnyvale, CA: Author; Atari, (1979) Atari Basketball, , Sunnyvale, CA: Author; Atari, (1979) Atari Football, , Sunnyvale, CA: Author; Atari, (1979) Atari Soccer, , Sunnyvale, CA: Author; Atari, (1980) Battlezone, , Sunnyvale, CA: Author; Atari, (1980) Battlezone: Operation, Maintenance and Service Manual, , Sunnyvale, CA: Author; Atari, (1980) Missile Command, , Sunnyvale, CA: Author; Atari, (1984) Marble Madness, , Sunnyvale, CA: Author; Atari, (1985) Marble Madness: Operators manual, , Sunnyvale, CA: Author; (1976) The Amazing Maze Game, , Bally/Midway Franklin Park, IL: Author; Björk, S., Holopainen, J., (2005) Patterns in game design, , Hingham, MA: Charles River Media; Butler, K., (2003) Donkey Kong FAQ. 1.01, , http://db.gamefaqs.com/coinop/arcade/file/donkey_kong_a.txt, Retrieved March 8, 2005; Butler, K., (2003) Joust FAQ. 1.01, , http://db.gamefaqs.com/coinop/arcade/file/joust.txt, Retrieved August 30, 2005; Butler, K., (2003) Phoenix FAQ. 1.0, , http://db.gamefaqs.com/coinop/arcade/file/phoenix.txt, Retrieved August 26, 2005; Butler, K., (2005) Robotron 2084 FAQ. 1.04, , http://db.gamefaqs.com/coinop/arcade/file/robotron_2084.txt, Retrieved March 30, 2005; Centuri, (1980) Phoenix service manual, , Hialeah, FL: Author; Crawford, C., (2003) Chris Crawford on game design, , Indianapolis, IN: New Riders; DeMaria, R., Wilson, J.I., (2004) High score!

The author then discusses what he call the ""projective stance,"" a type of embodied thinking characteristic of many (but not all) video games, as well as a form of thinking that is also, but more subtly, pervasive in everyday life and social interaction as well. © 2008 Sage Publications.","Embodiment; Identity; Thinking; Video games",,,,,,,,,"Bakhtin, M., (1981) The Dialogic Imagination, , Austin: University of Texas Press; Bakhtin, M.M., (1986) Speech Genres and Other Late Essays, , Austin: University of Texas Press; Barab, S.A., Thomas, M., Dodge, T., Carteaux, R., Tuzun, H., Making learning fun: Quest Atlantis, a game without guns (2005) Educational Technology Research and Development, 5 (1), pp. 86-108; Barab, S., Zuiker, S., Warren, S., Hickey, D., Ingram-Goble, A., Kwon, E.J., Embodied curriculum: Relating formalisms to contexts Science Education, , in press; Barsalou, L.W., Language comprehension: Archival memory or preparation for situated action (1999) Discourse Processes, 28, pp. 61-80; Barsalou, L.W., Perceptual symbol systems (1999) Behavioral and Brain Sciences, 22, pp. 577-660; Brown, J.S., Collins, A., Dugid, P., Situated cognition and the culture of learning (1989) Educational Researcher, 18, pp. 32-42; Clancey, W.J., (1997) Situated Cognition: On Human Knowledge and Computer Representations, , Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press; Clark, A., (1997) Being There: Putting Brain, Body, and World Together Again, , Cambridge, MA: The MIT Press; Clark, A., (2003) Natural-born Cyborgs: Why Minds and Technologies Are Made to Merge, , Oxford, UK: Oxford University Press; Damasio, A., (1999) The Feeling of What Happens: Body and Emotion in the Making of Consciousness, , Orlando, FL: Harvest Books; Damasio, A., (2003) Looking for Spinoza: Joy, Sorrow, and the Feeling Brain, , Orlando, Fl: Harvest Books; Engestrom, Y., Miettinen, R., Punamaki, R.L., (1999) Perspectives on Activity Theory, , Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press; Fleck, L., (1979) The Genesis and Development of A Scientific Fact, , Chicago: University of Chicago Press, Originally published 1935; Gee, J.P., (1992) The Social Mind: Language, Ideology, and Social Practice, , New York: Bergin & Garvey; Gee, J.P., (1996) Social Linguistics and Literacies: Ideology in Discourses, , 2nd ed, London: Routledge/Taylor & Francis; Gee, J.P., (2003) What Video Games Have to Teach Us about Learning and Literacy, , New York: Palgrave/Macmillan; Gee, J.P., (2004) Situated Language and Learning: A Critique of Traditional Schooling, , London: Routledge; Gee, J.P., Video games, mind, and learning (2005) The International Digital Media & Arts Association Journal, 2, pp. 37-42; Gee, J.P., (2005) Why Video Games Are Good for Your Soul: Pleasure and Learning, , Melbourne, Australia: Common Ground; Gee, J.P., Pleasure, learning, video games, and life: The projective stance (2007) A New Literacies Sampler, pp. 95-113. , M.

Competitive fandom draws together contemporary research on fan cultures and game design and game communities to describe the interaction present in fantasy sports. Fantasy sports games require a combination of fan culture practices and gamers' skills and habits of mind. Fandom becomes competitive when the knowledge acquired in the fan domain is transformed into strategic information to guide play in a new kind of game. This combination of frames helps describe the kinds of knowledge and motivation required to play fantasy sports and how such participation sparks further learning. Through analysis of individual game play within the context of the league community in which fantasy team owners play, the authors aim to understand what and how people learn from playing in competitive fandom settings and the implications of these findings for the design of learning environments. © 2008 Sage Publications.","Competitive gaming; Expertise; Fan culture; Fantasy sports",,,,,,,,,"Black, R.W., Language, culture, and identity in online fanfiction (2006) E-Learning, 3 (2), pp. 170-184; Bransford, J.D., Brown, A.L., Cocking, R.R., (2000) How People Learn: Brain, Mind, Experience, and School, , Eds, Washington, DC: National Academies Press; Buckingham, D., Sefton-Green, J., Structure, agency, and pedagogy in children's media culture (2004) Pikachu's Global Adventure: The Rise and Fall of Pokémon, pp. 12-33. , J.

It briefly describes the most popular of such programs and compares their key features, including the kinds of games that can be created with the software, the types of communities and resources that are associated with each program, claims made for learning outcomes resulting from use of the software, and the results of empirical research (if any) on the application and outcomes of the software in formal or informal educational settings. A key finding is that existing software and educational applications stress the goal of teaching users about computer programming and place little or no emphasis on teaching concepts related to game design. It concludes by discussing the potential value of explicit attention to ""design thinking"" as goal of game making in education. © 2008 Sage Publications.","Game design; Learning; Software; Thinking; Video games",,,,,,,,,"Adams, E., Rollings, A., Fundamentals of game design (2006) Game Design and Development Series, , Saddle River, NJ: Prentice Hall; Adamson, R., Hoyles, C., Tholander, J., Noss, R., (2002) Collaborative Change to Rules of the Game: From Player to System Rules, , Unpublished Proceedings of Computer Support for Collaborative Learning, Boulder, Colorado; Barab, S., Thomas, M., Dodge, T., Carteaux, R., Tuzun, H., Making learning fun: Quest Atlantis, A game without guns (2005) Educational Technology Research and Development, 53 (1), pp. 86-107; Bruckman, A.S., (1997) MOOSE Crossing: Construction, Community, and Learning in A Networked Virtual World for Kids, , Unpublished doctoral dissertation, Boston, Massachusetts Institute of Technology; Bruckman, A., Community support for constructivist learning (1998) Computer Supported Cooperative Work, 7, pp. 47-86; Bruckman, A., Situated support for learning: Storm's weekend with Rachael (2000) Journal of the Learning Sciences, 9 (3), pp. 329-372; Bruckman, A., Co-evolution of technological design and pedagogy in an online learning community (2004) Designing for Virtual Communities in the Service of Learning, pp. 239-255. , S.

Through political economy and ethnographic analysis, they show that online games, like other forms of technology, are sociocultural products that have been historically constituted by certain forms of knowledge and social practice. First, they map out the forces driving their development by examining government policies and competition among online games companies in Korea. They then explore capital flow to investigate the major players in the market. Finally, they explore the sociocultural elements contributing to the diffusion of online games in the cultural milieu specific to Korea. © 2008 SAGE Publications.","Ethnography; Korea; Online games; Policy; Political economy",,,,,,,,,"Babes with guns: Britain's videogame industry (1997) Economist, pp. 74-75. , February 22; Caillois, R., (1961) Man, play, and games, , New York: Free Press; Carr, D., Buckingham, D., Burn, A., Schott, G., (2006) Computer games: Text, narrative and play, , Maiden, MA: Polity; Castells, M., (1996) The rise of the network society, , Cambridge, MA: Blackwell; Castells, M., (1997) The power of identity, , Malden, MA: Blackwell; Castells, M., (1998) End of millenium, , Oxford, UK: Blackwell; Castronova, E., (2001) Virtual worlds: A first-hand account of market and society on the cyberian frontier, , http://www.bepress.com/giwp/default/vol2/iss1/art1/current_article.html, Retrieved May 31, 2002; Castronova, E., (2005) Synthetic worlds: The business and culture of online games, , Chicago: University of Chicago Press; Chee, F., (2005) Essays on Korean online game communities, , Unpublished master's thesis, Simon Fraser University, Burnaby; Chee, F., Understanding Korean experiences of online game hype, identity, and the menace of the Wang-tta (2005) Selected papers of the Second International Conference of the Digital Games Research Association (DIGRA) Changing Views: Worlds in Play, pp. 111-122. , S.

The study was conducted through observations and interviews with Black American middle school boys about digital games as an informal learning experience. The first goal of the study is to understand the cultural context that Black students from economically disadvantaged inner-city neighborhoods bring to playing digital games. The second goal of the study is to examine how this cultural context affects the learning opportunities with games. Third, the authors examine how differences in game play are potential factors in the discrepancy between White male gamers and Black male gamers in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. Finally, the authors address several opportunities within the field of informal learning to augment game play by bridging the learning that takes place within game play to the real world. © 2008 SAGE Publications.","African American; Games; Gender; Informal education; Race",,,,,,,,,"Cassell, J., Jenkins, H., Chess for girls?

Once just a convenient spot for high-speed connection, the PC bang has become a space for nurturing online gaming cultures. This article addresses two central characteristics of PC bang that have ensured its success. First, the paper explores the social and cultural dimensions of the PC bang as a space that nurtures the negotiation of offline and online relationships around online gaming cultures in Korea. Second, the paper discusses the role PC bangs play in the emergence of online games as a dominant game genre for Korean players. On the business side, a specialized pricing policy for PC bangs has made a vibrant business environment both for game publishers and PC bangs. Recent introduction of a micropayment business model, however, could be read as the demise of game publishers and PC bangs' synergies. © 2008 SAGE Publications.","Broadband internet in Korea; Korean online games; Lineage; PC bang; StarCraft",,,,,,,,,"Aizu, I., A comparative study of broadband in Asia: Deployment and policy (2002) GLCOM Colloquium No. 13, , http://www.glocom.org/special_topics/colloquium/20020529_bb_in_asia/, May 29 Retrieved Paper presented at; Chee, F., The games we play online and offline: Making Wang-tta in Korea (2006) Popular Communication, 4 (3), pp. 225-239; Chee, F., Jin, D., Age of new media empires: A critical interpretation of the Korean online game industry Games and Culture, , press; Dulin, R., Lineage: The Blood Pledge (2002) Gamespot.com, , http://www.gamespot.com/pc/rpg/Lineagethebloodpledge/review.html, January 9, Retrieved from; Hanguk MMORPG, munJe-ui hyunJang-ul jikyeboda (2005) Korean MMORPG, What are its problems?, , http://www.gamestudy.org/bbs/zboard.php? id=w&no=16, Gamestudy.org.

This article examines the influence of governmental policies on the development and operation of online games in China. The stance of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) toward online games has been influenced by three aspects of state policy: (a) information control, (b) technonationalism, and (c) social fears/pragmatic nationalism. CCP's specific policies toward the online game industry were put forward by CCP ministries and the Communist Youth League of China (CYLC) as a response to the economic potential and increasing influence of the rapidly growing online game industry in China. The interaction of these different policy fields has had complementary and contradictory elements shaping their implementation. © 2008 SAGE Publications.","China; Government; Online games; Policies; Regulation",,,,,,,,,"Anti-Japan War Online game to hit the market (2005) China Daily, , http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/english/doc/2005-08/31/content_473846.htm, August 31 Retrieved October 1, 2007; Attack of the clones (2006) Gamasutra, , http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/column_index.php?story=8399, September 11 Retrieved August 1, 2007; (2006) China Daily, , http://www.china.org.cn/english/government/183222.htm, October 9, Retrieved October 1, 2007; Beijing mayor cracks down on Internet cafés after fatal fire (2002) The New York Times, , http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res= 9804E2D9113CF934A25755C0A9649C8B63, June 17 Retrieved August 1, 2007; Berger, B., Private issues and public policy: Locating the corporate agenda in agenda-setting theory (2001) Journal of Public Relations Research, 13, pp. 91-126; Bian, Y., Xiaoling, S., Logan, S., Communist party membership and regime dynamics in China (2001) Social Forces, 79 (3), pp. 805-841; Boys will be boys, but Net addicts younger than in West (2007) Xinhua, , http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2007-01/17/content_5616699.htm, January, 17 Retrieved October 1, 2007; China to break foreign monopoly in online games (2004) People's Daily, , http://english.people.com.cn/200406/16/eng20040616_146461.html, June 16 Retrieved August 1, 2007; China censors online skeletons (2007) Financial Times, , http://search.ft.com/ftArticle?queryText=china+online+games&aje= true&id=070629010365, June 29, Retrieved August 1, 2007; (2001) People's Daily, , http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/200107/20/eng20010720_75430.html, China cleans Internet cafes, July 20, Retrieved August 1, 2007; China fights game arcades (2000) BBC, , http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/938961.stm, September 23, Retrieved August 1, 2007; China Internet café debate hots up (2001) BBC, , http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/world/monitoring/media_reports/1302309.stm, April 29, Retrieved August 1, 2007; China Internet Network Information Center, , http://www.cnnic.net.cn/en/index/0O/02/index.htm, various years, Statistical survey report on the Internet in China.

Having received considerable attention across a wide range of technologies, markets, and economies, there is comparatively little academic research on convergence in the computer and video games industry. This article investigates this issue by drawing attention to three salient areas of gaming convergence-technological, content, and market. A detailed examination is provided, drawing from a broad selection of literature and practical examples of gaming hardware and software to illustrate the prevalence of convergence in its various forms. The results provide a unique chronological overview of the impact of convergence on the previous and current generations of games and games platforms. The discussion focuses on the new demands placed on the creation of game technology and content, emerging market trends, and the ramifications as a result of the evolving nature of gaming convergence. © 2008 SAGE Publications.","Computer games; Content convergence; Games market; Market convergence; Technological convergence; Video games",,,,,,,,,"Activision, (2004) Shrek 2, , Santa Monica, CA: Author; Activision, (2004) Spiderman 2, , Santa Monica, CA: Author; Andersson, P., Mölleryd, B., Telecommunication services in context (1997) International Journal of Service Industry Management, 8 (5), pp. 453-473; (2005) EDGE, 153, pp. 50-55. , Ape escape; Asakura, R., (2000) Revolutionaries at Sony, , New York: McGraw-Hill; Athreye, S., Keeble, D., Technological convergence, globalisation and ownership in the UK computer industry (2000) Technovation, 20, pp. 227-245; Baldwin, T., McVoy, D., Steinfield, C., (1996) Convergence: Integrating media, information & communication, , London: Sage; Bernard, A., Jones, C., Technology and convergence (1996) Economic Journal, 106, pp. 1037-1044; Bittanti, M., (2001) The technoludic film: Images of video games in movies (1973-2001), , Unpublished master's thesis, San Jose State University, San Jose, CA; Blackman, C., Paying the price: The future for Europe's media sector (2004) Foresight, 6 (5), pp. 292-301; Bores, C., Saurina, C., Torres, R., Technological convergence: A strategic perspective (2003) Technovation, 23, pp. 1-13; Brits show appetite for mobile TV (2006) BBC, , http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/4620792.stm, Retrieved November 2007 from; Buxton, W., Less is more (more or less): Uncommon sense and the design of computers (2001) The invisible future: The seamless integration of technology in everyday life, pp. 145-179. , http://www/billbuxton.com/LessIsMore.html, P.

Taking its cue from recent research emphasizing the educational value of computer and video games, this article investigates the bias of the medium in presenting history. Although sharing an appreciation for the cultural value of history simulations and games, the author argues that the digital game medium currently tends to result in stereotypically masculine, mechanical, and spatially oriented interactive presentations of history. This article does not take a technological determinist stance nor a simplistic view of interpretation. Nevertheless, the author believes that the weight and momentum of the historical development of the digital game medium, its technological structure, and its institutional character have encouraged certain patterns in digital games that should be critically examined. © 2007 Sage Publications.","Computer games; Digital game medium; History; Media bias; Simulation",,,,,,,,,"Aarseth, E.J., (1997) Cybertext: Perspectives on ergodic literature, , Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press; (1986) Tetris [Computer game], , AcademySoft Moscow: Author; Barkin, G., (2002) The culture of Civilization III.

Building on constructions of consumer behavior as both a sense-making activity and a resource for the construction of daydreams, as well as anthropological readings of performance, the authors speculate that many performances during digital play are products of consumer fantasy. The authors develop an interpretation of the relationship between the real and the virtual that is better equipped to understand the movement between consumer daydreams and those practices actualized in the material and now also in digital virtual reality. The authors argue that digital virtual performances present opportunities for liminoid transformations through inversions, speculations, and playfulness acted out in aesthetic dramas. To illustrate, the authors consider specific examples of the theatrical productions available to consumers in digital spaces, highlighting the consumer imagination that feeds them, the performances they produce, and the potential for transformation in consumer-players. © 2007 Sage Publications.","Aesthetic drama; Fantasy; Liminoid; Virtual consumption",,,,,,,,,"Baudrillard, J., (1994) Simulacra and Simulation, , Ann Arbor: University of Michigan Press; Video games: Cause for concern?

The performativity of video gaming insists on a consideration of its material and discursive dimensions that not only refuses to metonymically reduce the gamer's body to a pair of eyes but also complicates popular dualistic understandings of the player-game relationship. © 2007 Sage Publications.","Aesthetics; Embodiment; Interobjectivity; Intersubjectivity; Materiality; Performance; Performativity; Video games",,,,,,,,,"Aarseth, E., Genre trouble: Narrativism and the art of simulation (2004) First person: New media as story, performance, and game, pp. 45-55. , N.

The article claims that unintended practices of play, player ""anarchy"" through appropriation of the game, are difficult in a game like SIMCITY, thus frustrating the claims and the idea of SIMCITY as a borderless playground. © 2007 Sage Publications.","Computer games; Participation culture; Player anarchy; SimCity; Toys",,,,,,,,,"Beckett, A., Revenge of the town planners (1996) The London Independent, , http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_19960122/ai_n9639995, January 22, Retrieved July, 13th, 2007; Caillois, R., (1958) Les jeux et les hommes: Le masque et le vertige, , Plays and men: The mask and giddiness, Paris: Gallimard; Caillois, R., (1961) Man, play, and games, , New York: Free Press; (2002) SimCity: The Syrup FAQ, , http://faqs.ign.com/articles/369/369282p1.html, CaptainSyrup Retrieved December 15, 2006; Cascio, J., The map is not the terrain; the Sim is not the city (2004) To know it for the first time-place, environment and ecology, , http://www.worldchanging.com/>archives/001622.html, Retrieved December 15, 2006; Dargahi, N., Bremer, M., (1996) Spelen met SimCity 2000: Macht, Politiek en Strategie [Playing with SimCity 2000], , (2nd ed., L.

Literature suggests that people exhibit normative behavior in online environments. The complex actions and interactions possible with the game's avatars and a minimal game structure make TSO an evocative online space in which to examine social interaction. Through participation and observation, we examined conversation and avatar conduct in TSO and found norms for verbal and nonverbal behavior that governed both text and avatar use. These norms are related to offline expectations of politeness and etiquette associated with visiting and hosting in people's homes, and they correspond with the visual dollhouse-like environment of TSO and its characters. This game is a special context where social norms are clear and powerful, affecting not only players' game play but also their social interaction. © 2007 Sage Publications.","Avatar use; Multiplayer games; Online games; Social norms; The Sims Online",,,,,,,,,"Ambady, N., Koo, J., Lee, F., Rosenthal, R., More than words: Linguistic and nonlinguistic politeness in two cultures (1996) Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 70, pp. 996-1011; Baym, N.K., The emergence of on-line community (1998) Cybersociety 2.0: Revisiting computer-mediated communication and community, pp. 35-68. , S.

The first voice is younger and more conventionally leftist. It was fully embedded in the intellectual debates of the late 1960s. A committed Marxist, the younger Baudrillard wrote on labor and needs, use-value and production. But after this period as a young man, Baudrillard transitioned into a very different thinker in the middle to late 1970s. He developed a whole new theoretical vocabulary that was completely in tune with that decade's historical transformation into digitization, postindustrial economies, immaterial labor, mediation, and simulation. His theories of play and games are at the very heart of this transformation. Through a close reading of several texts, this essay explores Baudrillard's interest in play and games through the concepts of seduction, the fatal strategy, illusion, and what he called the ""principle of separation."" © 2007 Sage Publications.","Baudrillard; Game; Illusion; Play; Seduction; Separative cause",,,,,,,,,"Baudrillard, J., La pratique sociale De la technique (1969) Utopie, 2, pp. 147-155; Baudrillard, J., (1976) L'Échange symbolique et la mort, , Paris: Gallimard; Baudrillard, J., (1977) Oublier Foucault, , Paris: Éditions Galilée; Baudrillard, J., (1977) L'Effet Beaubourg, , Paris: Galilée; Baudrillard, J., (1979) De la séduction, , Paris: Éditions Galilée; Baudrillard, J., (1983) Les strategies fatales, , Paris: Éditions Grasset & Fasquelle; Baudrillard, J., Forget Baudrillard: An interview with Sylvère Lotringer (1987) Forget Foucault, pp. 65-137. , New York: Semiotexte; Baudrillard, J., (1987) L'Autre par lui-même: Habilitation, , Paris: Éditions Galilée; Baudrillard, J., (1991) La Guerre du Golfe n'a pas eu lieu, , Paris: Éditions Galilée; Baudrillard, J., (1994) La pensée radicale, , Paris: Sens & Tonka; Baudrillard, J., (1997) Écran total, , Paris: Éditions Galilée; Baudrillard, J., (1997) Le paroxyste indifférent: Entretiens avec Philippe Petit, , Paris: Éditions Grasset & Fasquelle; Baudrillard, J., (2000) Cool memories IV: 1995-2000, , Paris: Éditions Galilée; Baudrillard, J., (2000) Mots De passe, , Paris: Éditions Fayard; Baudrillard, J., (2001) Le ludique et le policier & autres écrits parus dans Utopie (1967-1978), , Paris: Sens & Tonka; Baudrillard, J., The transparency of kitsch (2001) The uncollected Baudrillard, pp. 143-154. , G.

While the game structure of binary combat is most often seen in terms of simple entertainment, lacking narrative power and encouraging an apathetic and passive attitude to violence, the author argues that games such as Mortal Kombat, Street Fighter, and Soul Calibur are complex in terms of their construction of stereotyped identity and in the binary structure of combative play. Further, the significance of the genre lies in the performative aspects of gameplay, which problematize accepted models of identification and immersion. Once the player is introduced into the superficial binary structure of combat, then that player's choice and agency become the primary factors in gameplay, ultimately creating space for the inversion of stereotype, the subversion of gender roles and the possible transcendence of the binary system. © 2007 Sage Publications.","Agency; Identity; Performance; Soul Calibur II; Stereotype; Violence",,,,,,,,,"Atkins, B., (2003) More than a game: The computer game as fictional form, , Manchester, UK: Manchester University Press; Barrett, G., Archetypes in Japanese film: The sociopolitical and religious significance of the principal heroes and heroines (1989) Selinsgrove, , PA: Susquehanna University Press; Carr, D., Play dead: Genre and affect in Silent Hill and Planetscape Torment (2003) Game Studies, 3 (1). , http://www.gamestudies.org/0301/carr, Retrieved May 2, 2005; Carr, D., Buckingham, D., Burn, A., Schott, G., (2006) Computer games: Text, narrative and play, , Cambridge, UK: Polity; Cassell J, Jenkins H, (1998) From Barbie to Mortal Kombat: Gender and computer games, , Cambridge, MA: MIT Press; Chandler, H.M., (2005) The game localization handbook, , Hingham, MA: Charles River Media; Fine, G.A., (1983) Shared fantasy: Role-playing games as social worlds, , Chicago: University of Chicago Press; Griffiths, M.D., Davies, M.N.O., Chappell, D., Breaking the stereotype: The case of online gaming (2003) CyberPsychology & Behavior, 6 (1), pp. 81-91; Hamby, R.H., Ballard, M., Gun peripherals and video game play: Is there a weapons priming effect?

Drawing on a conception of identities in practice, the analyses show that dominant assumptions about women's preferences and orientations toward video gaming do not reflect the diverse ways that women might make meaning of, respond to, and take pleasure in such games. To better understand women's and men's orientations toward gaming, the article argues for the need to take into account the complexity of people's identities, not just gender alone but its interplay with and enactment in combination with personal histories and cultural factors that play out differently in individuals' lives. This understanding, in turn, leads to insights into how video games may serve as spaces for the enactment of new forms of gendered identities. © 2007 Sage Publications.","Gender; Identity; Role-playing; Women",,,,,,,,,"Angelo, J., (2004) New Study Reveals That Women over 40 Who Play Online Games Spend Far More Time Playing Than Male or Teenage Gamers, , http://media.aoltimewarner.com/media/cb_press_view.cfm?release_num= 55253774, Retrieved May 14, 2005, from; Softworks, B., (2006) The Elder Scrolls, , http://www.morrowind.com/codex/history_morrowind.htm, Retrieved April 15, 2005 from; Campbell, A., (2002) A Mind of Her Own: The Evolutionary Psychology of Women, , New York: Oxford University Press; Cassell, J., Story telling as a nexus of change (1998) From Barbie to Mortal Kombat, pp. 298-327. , J.

The author offers a new approach to games that stresses them as characterized by process. Games, the author argues, are domains of contrived contingency, capable of generating emergent practices and interpretations, and are intimately connected with everyday life to a degree heretofore poorly understood. This approach is both consistent with a range of existing social theory and avoids many of the limitations that have characterized much games scholarship to date, in particular its tendency toward unsustainable formalism and exceptionalism. Rather than seeing gaming as a subset of play, and therefore as an activity that is inherently separable, safe, and pleasurable, the author offers a pragmatic rethinking of games as social artifacts in their own right that are always in the process of becoming. This view both better accords with the experience of games by participants cross-culturally and bears the weight of the new questions being asked about games and about society. © 2007 Sage Publications.","Contingency; Games; Play; Practice theory; Process",,,,,,,,,"Aarseth, E., (1997) Cybertext: Perspectives on Ergodic Literature, , Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press; Bauman, R., Verbal art as performance (1977) Verbal Art As Performance, pp. 3-58. , R.

As video games now make up an important segment of the film industry's market, this critical engagement is needed to extend the scholarship on video games. Specifically, this essay critically engages the concept of interactivity as an important theoretical construction in the study of video games. Through an analysis of The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King video game, the authors discover that interactivity can be limited in a way that augments the synergistic connections between films and video games. © 2006 Sage Publications.","Agency; Fan culture; Incorporation; Political economy; Tolkien",,,,,,,,,"Ang, I., (1996) Living room wars: Rethinking media audiences for a postmodern world, , New York: Routledge; Bryce, J., Rutter, J., Spectacle of the deathmatch: Character and narrative in first-person shooters (2002) Screenplay: Cinema/video games/interfaces, pp. 66-80. , G.

Rather than situating participants in simulated environments, which mimic the physical world, HRGs make use of physical world immersion by merging physical and digital spaces. Online multiuser environments already connect users who do not share contiguous spaces. With mobile devices, players may additionally incorporate interactions with the surrounding physical space. This article is a speculative study about the potential uses of HRGs in education, as activities responsible for taking learning practices outside the closed classroom environment into open, public spaces. Adopting the framework of sociocultural learning theory, the authors analyze design elements of existing HRGs, such as mobility and location awareness, collaboration/sociability, and the configuration of the game space, with the aim of reframing these games into an educational context to foresee how future games might contribute to discovery and learning. © 2006 Sage Publications.","Collaboration; Educational technology; Hybrid reality games; Hybrid spaces; Mobile technologies; Problem solving; Situated learning; Urban spaces",,,,,,,,,"Aarseth, E., (1997) Cybertext: Perspectives on ergodic literature, , Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press; Aarseth, E., Genre trouble: Narrativism and the art of simulation (2004) First person: New media as story, performance, and game, pp. 45-55. , N.

And why are game studies today being talked about in ways similar to the rhetoric that accompanied the history of science in the 1960s and 1970s? The author suggests that the growth of history of science then and game studies now has been fueled by similar motivations and strategies.

These connections range from player style through game-play options to social interaction and player-controlled social modifiers within both types of games. The comparison is based on play, observation, and interviews with players in MUDs and in WoW. © 2006 Sage Publications.","Game studies; MMORPG; MUD; Role-playing games",,,,,,,,,"Bartle, R., Hearts, clubs, diamonds, spades: Players who suit MUDs (1996) Journal of MUD Research, 1 (1). , http://www.brandeis.edu/pubs/jove/HTML/v1/bartle.html, Retrieved August 8, 2006; Bartle, R., Trubshaw, R., (1980) MUD, 1. , http://www.british-legends.com, Retrieved August 8, 2006; (2004) World of Warcraft, , Blizzard Game, Blizzard Entertainment Inc; (2005) World of Warcraft® Surpasses Five Million Customers Worldwide, , http://www.blizzard.com/press/051219.shtml, Blizzard December, Retrieved February 21, 2006; Caillois, R., (2001) Man, play, and games, , Chicago: University of Illinois; Castranova, E., Virtual worlds: A first-hand account of market and society on the cyberian frontier (2001) The Gruter Institute Working Papers on Law, Economics, and Evolutionary Biology, 2. , http://www.bepress.com/giwp/default/vol2/iss1/art1/current_article.html, Retrieved August 8, 2006; Csikszentmihalyi, M., (1990) Flow: The psychology of optimal experience, , New York: HarperPerennial; Dahl H.

This article argues that to understand the game's formal, aesthetic, and structural specificity, its pleasures and potential meanings, it is essential to investigate how the mythic functions. The author shows that the mythic plays a primary role in making a consistent fantasy world in terms of game play, morality, culture, time, and environment. It provides a rationale for players' actions, as well as the logic that under- pins the stylistic profile of the game, its objects, tasks, and characters. In terms of the ""cultural"" environments of the game, the presence of a coherent and extensive myth scheme is core to the way differences and conflicts between races are organized. And, as a form of intertextual resonance, its mythology furnishes the game with a ""thickness"" of meaning that promotes, for players, a sense of mythological being as well as encouraging an in-depth textual engagement. © 2006 Sage Publications.","Fantasy; MMoRPG; Myth; World creation; World of Warcraft",,,,,,,,,"Benjamin, W., Osborne, J., (2003) The origin of German tragic drama, , London: Verso, Original work published 1963; Bolter, J.D., Grusin, R., (2000) Remediation: Understanding new media, , Cambridge, MA: MIT Press; Caesar, J., Hammond, C., (1996) The Gallic wars, , Oxford, UK: Oxford University Press; Campbell, J., (1969) The hero with a thousand faces, , 2nd ed, Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press; Eskelinen, M., (2004) Markku Eskelinen's response, , http://www.electronicbookreview.com/thread/firstperson/astragalian, Retrieved March 9, 2006; Frazer, J.G., The golden bough: Abridged (1994) Abridgement by Robert Fraser, , Oxford, UK: Oxford University Press, Original work published 1890; Hardy, R., Schaffer, A., (1973) The Wicker Man [Motion picture], , Director, (Writer) United Kingdom: British Lion Film Company; Kaveney, R., (2005) From Alien to The Matrix, , London: I.

The author argues here that a pluralistic approach is required if the full complexity of games is to be addressed and analyzed, and as such, textual approaches to the analysis games should not be dismissed no matter what the particular focus of attention. To understand a game's design, the way it seeks to shape the player's experience and to make the game meaningful, it is essential to take account of the formal features of a given game. Being up close and personal forces one to think through the specificities of a game and what it is like to play that game. The author therefore advocates a combination of a formal and phenomenological approach as a means of exploring the complex relationship between game text and player. © 2006 Sage Publications.","Game play; Phenomenology; Pleasure; Power; Textual analysis",,,,,,,,,"Mäyrä, F., (2005) The Quiet Revolution: Three Theses for the Future of Game Studies, , http://www.digra.org/hardcore/hc4, Retrieved May 2005 from","Krzywinska, T.; Brunel UniversityUnited Kingdom",,,,,,,,15554120,,,,"English","Games Cult.",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-34548380788

The focus is on metrics reflecting a player's gaming experience: how long they play, the classes and races they prefer, and so on. The authors then discuss why and how players remain committed to this game, how WoW's design partitions players into groups with varying backgrounds and aspirations, and finally how players ""consume"" the game's content, with a particular focus on the endgame at Level 60 and the impact of player-versus-player-combat. The data illustrate how WoW refined a formula inherited from preceding MMOs.

Next, the resulting interview transcripts were reviewed to explore player behaviors, attitudes, and opinions; the meanings they make; the social capital they derive; and the networks they form and to develop a typology of players and guilds. In keeping with current Internet research findings, players were found to use the game to extend real-life relationships, meet new people, form relationships of varying strength, and also use others merely as a backdrop.

To tie these two threads together and account for the use of these environments for the development of expertise and credentials, the author proposes adding a third form, cultural capital, to the mix and outlines a model for understanding capital in all its manifestations: material, social, and cultural. This model will make it possible to explore how actors within synthetic worlds transform, or parlay, these forms from one into the other and how these forms are used across all the domains wherein users act, blurring any qualitative distinction between virtual and real worlds. © 2006 Sage Publications.","Cultural capital; MMORPGs; Social capital; Virtual worlds",,,,,,,,,"Bourdieu, P., (1977) Outline of A Theory of Practice, , R.

Life in game worlds is not exempt from forms of player-based regulation and control. Drawing on ethnographic and interview work within World of Warcraft, the author undertakes initial inquiries on this subject by looking at three areas: nationalism, age, and surveillance. This case study shows systems of stratification and control can arise from the bottom up and be implemented in not only everyday play culture but even player-produced modifications to the game system itself. Due to the ways these systems may simultaneously facilitate play, there is often an ambivalent dynamic at work. This piece also prompts some methodological considerations. By discussing field site choice, the author argues that context is of utmost importance and needs to be more thoughtfully foregrounded within game studies. © 2006 Sage Publications.","Computer games; MMOG; Modding; Online community",,,,,,,,,"Albrechtslund, A., Dubbeld, L., The plays and arts of surveillance: Studying surveillance as entertainment (2005) Surveillance & Society, 3, pp. 216-221; Andrejevic, M., The work of watching one another: Lateral surveillance, risk, and governance (2005) Surveillance & Society, 2, pp. 479-497; Ang, I., New technologies, audience measurement, and the tactics of television consumption (2000) Electronic media and technoculture, pp. 183-196. , J.

The focus, always, is not on what is before the player or the ""what happens next"" of traditionally unfolding narrative but on the ""what happens next if I"" that places the player at the center of experience as its principle creator, necessarily engaged in an imaginative act, and always orientated toward the future. © 2006 Sage Publications.","Aesthetics; Cinema; Computer games; The gaze; Video games",,,,,,,,,"Aarseth, E., Genre trouble (2004) First Person: New Media As Story, Performance and Game, , http://www.electronicbookreview.com/thread/firstperson/vigilant, N.
