The dominant narrative of grief, however, generally assumes that the experience is a finite, linear process of detachment. Given past research challenging the reality of that experience, we draw upon Doka's (2002) theory of disenfranchised grief to propose that grief is not only a possible temporary state of disenfranchisement, but rather a perpetual, ongoing state of being disenfranchised. This condition is primarily maintained by the need to constantly navigate the lines between the dominant narrative of grief upheld in a given culture and one's personal experience and performance of it. We propose a narrative approach to the concept of grief as a potential solution to this problem, and outline several new potential avenues for research on grief. © 2020 Review of Communication Research.",Bereavement; Communication; Death and dying; Grief; Identity; Narratives,,,,,,,,"Archer, J., Theories of grief: Past, present, and future perspectives (2008) Handbook of Bereavement Research and Practice: Advances in Theory and Intervention, pp. 45-65. , In M.

However, there has been little systematic effort to synthesizing the unintended effects of advertising. This paper attempt to fill the gap in the literature. A thematic review was conducted to review the dimensions, types, and theories concerning the unintended effects of advertising. Variations of unintended effects in valence, levels of analysis, time lapse, content specificity, and audience types were discerned, on the basis of which a typology of nine unintended effects was proposed, including confusion, materialism, idealization, stereotypes, boomerang, violence, creativity, job performance and economic growth. The implications and directions for future research were discussed. It is hoped that the conceptual dimensions and types of unintended effects presented in this paper will serve as an evolving framework for endeavors to enhancing the theory and practice of advertising. © 2020 Review of Communication Research.",Advertising; Review; Unintended effects,,,,,,,,"Anderson, E.T., Simester, D., Advertising in a competitive market: The role of product standards, customer learning, and switching costs (2013) Journal of Marketing Research, 50 (4), pp. 489-504; Arendt, C., LaFleche, M., Limperopulos, M.A., A qualitative meta-analysis of apologia, image repair, and crisis communication: Implications for theory and practice (2017) Public Relations Review, 43, pp. 517-526; Baek, T.H., The value of the third-person effect in theory building (2017) Review of Communication, 17, pp. 74-86; Braun, V., Clarke, V., Using thematic analysis in psychology (2006) Qualitative Research in Psychology, 3, pp. 77-101; Brehm, J.W., Brehm, S.S., (1981) Psychological reactance: A theory of freedom and control, , San Diego Calif.: Academic Press; Brocato, E.D., Gentile, D.A., Laczniak, R.N., Maier, J.A., Ji-Song, M., Television commercial violence: Potential effects on children (2010) Journal of Advertising, 39 (4), pp. 95-107; Buijzen, M., Valkenburg, P.M., The unintended effects of television advertising: A parent-child survey (2003) Communication Research, 30 (5), pp. 483-503; Celsi, M.W., Gilly, M.C., Employees as internal audience: How advertising affects employees' customer focus (2010) Journal of Academy of Marketing Science, 38 (4), pp. 520-529; Chakravarti, A., Xie, J., The impact of standards competition on consumers: Effectiveness of product information and advertising formats (2006) Journal of Marketing Research, 43, pp. 224-236; Chan, K., McNeal, J.U., Rural Chinese children as consumers: Consumption experience and information sourcing (2006) Journal of Consumer Behavior, 5, pp. 182-192; Chang, C., Self-congruency as a cue in different advertising-processing contexts (2002) Communication Research, 29 (5), pp. 503-536; Cho, H., Salmon, C.T., Unintended effects of health communication campaigns (2007) Journal of Communication, 57, pp. 293-317; Churchill, G.A., Moschis, G.P., Television and interpersonal influences on adolescent consumer learning (1979) Journal of Consumer Research, 6, pp. 23-35; Compton, J., Arby's image repair tactics as a public relations strategy (2014) Public Relations Review, 40, pp. 122-124; Dahlen, M., Rosengren, S., If advertising won't die, what will it be.

How groups handle conflict can affect group performance, satisfaction, and commitment (Martinez-Moreno, Gonzalez-Navarro, Zornoza, & Ripoll, 2009; Pazos, 2012; Staples & Webster, 2007; Workman, 2007). Much of this literature focuses on online, task-oriented work groups, and how these groups differ from face-to-face (F2F) groups. However, hybrid groups (i.e., those that work both F2F and online) are increasingly common. To better understand conflict in hybrid groups, we review 68 articles regarding online, hybrid, and F2F groups that highlight the differences between F2F and online groups and consider what these differences mean for hybrid groups. In doing so, we identify several emergent themes related to how conflict is managed in online and hybrid groups. The literature suggests that there are many benefits to online and hybrid groups, such as the ability to assemble more diverse teams and work asynchronously, but that conflict is also more common in online than F2F groups. Strong norms and leadership behaviors that encourage trust and cohesion appear to reduce conflict and its effects on group performance and decision making, especially in online groups. These findings suggest that in hybrid groups, F2F meetings might be used to quickly establish group norms, trust, and cohesion, which can then improve online group interactions. However, more research is needed to understand how conflict occurs and is managed in hybrid groups. Future communication research should focus on examining conflict management in hybrid groups using computer-mediated communication perspectives. © 2020, Review of Communication Research.",CMC; Conflict; Hybrid groups; Intergroup communication; Online groups; Organizational communication; Review,,,,,,,,"Ayoko, O.B., Callan, V.J., Teams' reactions to conflict and teams' task and social outcomes: The moderating role of transformational and emotional leadership (2010) European Management Journal, 28, pp. 220-235. , https://doi.org/10.1016/j.emj.2009.07.001; Ayoko, O.B., Konrad, A.M., Boyle, M.V., Online work: Managing conflict and emotions for performance in virtual teams (2012) European Management Journal, 30, pp. 156-174. , https://doi.org/10.1016/j.emj.2011.10.001; Baruch, Y., Lin, C.-P., All for one, one for all: Coopetition and virtual team performance (2012) Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 79, pp. 1155-1168. , https://doi.org/10.1016/j.techfore.2012.01.008; Bierly, P.E., Stark, E.M., Kessler, E.H., The moderating effects of virtuality on the antecedents and outcome of NPD team trust (2009) Journal of Product Innovation Management, 26, pp. 551-565. , https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1540-5885.2009.00680.x; Branson, L., Clausen, T.S., Sung, C.-H., Group style differences between virtual and F2F teams (2008) American Journal of Business, 23, pp. 65-70; Bodtker, A.M., Jameson, J.K., Emotion in conflict formation and its transformation: Application to organizational conflict management (2001) International Journal of Conflict Management, 12, pp. 259-275; Buengeler, C., Klonek, F., Lehmann-Willenbrock, N., Morency, L.-P., Poppe, R., Killer apps: Developing novel applications that enhance team coordination, communication, and effectiveness (2017) Small Group Research, 48, pp. 591-620. , https://doi.org/10.1177/1046496417721745; Chang, W.-L., Lee, C.-Y., Virtual team e-leadership: The effects of leadership style and conflict management mode on the online learning performance of students in a business-planning course (2013) British Journal of Educational Technology, 44 (6), pp. 986-999; Chen, M.-H., Chang, Y.-C., The dynamics of conflict and creativity during a project's life cycle: A comparative study between service-driven and technology-driven teams in Taiwan (2005) International Journal of Organizational Analysis, 13, pp. 127-150; Chiravuri, A., Nazareth, D., Ramamurthy, K., Cognitive conflict and consensus generation in virtual teams during knowledge capture: Comparative effectiveness of techniques (2011) Journal of Management Information Systems, 28, pp. 311-350; Correia, A.-P., Team conflict in ICT-rich environments: Roles of technologies in conflict management (2008) British Journal of Educational Technology, 39, pp. 18-35. , https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-8535.2007.00731.x-i1; Cramton, C.D., Orvis, K.L., (2003) Overcoming barriers to information sharing in virtual teams, , C.

Based on this review, we argue that the theory and research on each of these cognitive effects share a common view that media affect audience members by influencing the relative importance of considerations used to make subsequent judgments (including their answers to post-exposure survey questions). In reviewing this literature, we note that one important factor is often ignored, the extent to which a consideration featured in the message is deemed usable for a given subsequent judgment, a factor called judged usability, which may be an important mediator of cognitive media effects like agenda setting, framing, and priming. Emphasizing judged usability leads to the revelation that media coverage may not just elevate a particular consideration, but may also actively suppress a consideration, rendering it less usable for subsequent judgments. Thus, it opens a new avenue for cognitive effects research. In the interest of integrating these strands of cognitive effects research, we propose the Judged Usability Model as a revision of past cognitive models. © 2020, Review of Communication Research.",Agenda-setting; Cognitive media effects; Framing effects; Judged usability model; Media effects; News framing; Priming,,,,,,,,"Althaus, S.L., Kim, Y.M., Priming effects in complex information environments: Reassessing the impact of news discourse on presidential approval (2006) The Journal of Politics, 68 (4), pp. 960-976. , https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1468-2508.2006.00483.x; Althaus, S.L., Tewksbury, D., Agenda setting and the ""new"" news: Patterns of issue importance among readers of the paper and online versions of the New York Times (2002) Communication Research, 29 (2), pp. 180-207; Anderson, J.R., (1983) The architecture of cognition, , Cambridge MA: Harvard University Press; Anderson, N.H., (1981) Foundations of information integration theory, , New York: Academic Press; Benton, M., Frazier, J.P., The agenda setting function of the mass media at three levels of ""information holding"" (1976) Communication Research, 3 (3), pp. 261-274; Brewer, P.R., Graf, J., Willnat, L., Priming or framing: Media influence on attitudes toward foreign countries (2003) International Communication Gazette, 65 (6), pp. 493-508; Carpentier, F.D., Agenda setting and priming effects based on information presentation: Revisiting accessibility as a mechanism explaining agenda setting and priming (2014) Mass Communication & Society, 17 (4), pp. 531-552. , https://doi.org/10.1080/15205436.2013.816744; Chaiken, S., Heuristic versus systematic information processing and the use of source versus message cues in persuasion (1980) Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 39 (5), pp. 752-766. , https://doi.org/10.1037/0022-3514.39.5.752; Chaiken, S., The heuristic model of persuasion (1987) Social influence: The Ontario Symposium, 5, pp. 3-39. , In M.

Almost 2900 English and 8600 other UN languages titles and abstracts were scanned of which 33 English and 13 other UN languages data-based primary studies were selected, which were classified into four methodological streams: Quantitative-comparison groups; Quantitative-descriptive survey; Qualitative; and Mixed-method and case-study. Study characteristics (study method, country, emergency type, emergency phase, at-risk population) and study findings (in narrative form) were extracted from individual studies. The findings were synthesized within methodological streams and evaluated for certainty and confidence. These within-method findings were next synthesized across methodological streams to develop an overarching synthesis of findings. The findings showed that country coverage focused on high and middle-income countries in Asia, Europe, North America, and Oceania, and the event most covered was infectious disease followed by flood and earthquake. The findings also showed that uncertainty in public health emergency events is a multi-faceted concept with multiple components. There is universal agreement, with some exceptions, that communication to the public should include explicit information about event uncertainties, and this information must be consistent and presented in an easy to understand format. Additionally, uncertainty related to events requires a distinction between uncertainty information and uncertainty experience. At-risk populations experience event uncertainty in lives full of uncertainties from other sources. Event uncertainty is experienced and uncertainty information may be understood and misunderstood in the same general ways by the public, experts, and policy makers. Experience of event uncertainty may be a defining feature for media professionals as well due to contradictory and inconsistent information in the environment. © 2019, Review of Communication Research.",Disaster communication; Public health emergency events; Risk communication; Uncertainty,,,,,,"World Health Organization, WHO

Twelve years later it was the so-called ""Year of the Woman"" in 1992 that sparked increased scholarly attention on women as political communicators. A record number of women, 117, ran for the U.S. Congress in 1992, but the number of women running and serving has been slow to increases since that time. One reason may be the unique challenges gender poses for female political communicators. Over three decades of research has proven gender stereotypes and expectations play a key role in how women (and men) communicate with voters. This review of research summarizes major findings and changes in gender and political communication research over the past three decades. Our focus is on communication by candidates and how gender shapes that communication. In all, 133 scholarly sources were reviewed; these sources included scholarly journals from related disciplines as well as books using quantitative, qualitative, and rhetorical methods. Our analysis demonstrates that gender stereotypes are still prevalent in American political campaigns, and women candidates must work to overcome the belief that they are not masculine enough to be political leaders. Additionally this review reveals two common strategies candidates use to negotiate gender stereotypes: feminine style and gender adaptiveness. We conclude that more research is needed to better understand how candidates navigate gender stereotypes in the 21st century, particularly in political debates and online communication. © 2019, Review of Communication Research.",Double bind; Feminine style; Gender; Gender adaptiveness; Political campaigns; Political communication; Women,,,,,,,,"Alexander, D., Anderson, K., Gender as a factor in the attribution of leadership traits (1993) Political Research Quarterly, 46 (3), pp. 527-545; ""America is back.""

We identified 88 published tests of media literacy interventions then analyzed their content using five coding variables that indicated the degree to which authors of those studies established basic validity. We first conducted a meaning analysis to identify the definitions that authors of those studies presented for media literacy. Then we used those definitions to determine the extent to which those authors provided a complete (content validity) and accurate (face validity) operationalization in the design of their measures. © 2019, Review of Communication Research.",Critical analysis; Explication; Meaning analysis; Media literacy interventions; Validity,,,,,,,,"Abelman, R., Courtright, J., Television literacy: Amplifying the cognitive level effects of television's prosocial fare through curriculum intervention (1983) Journal of Research and Development in Education, 17 (1), pp. 46-57; Adams, D., Hamm, M., (2001) Literacy in a multimedia age, , Norwood, MA: Christopher-Gordon Publishers; Aguaded-Gómez, I., Tirado-Morueta, R., Hernando-Gómez, Á., Media competence in adult citizens in Andalusia, Spain (2015) Information, Communication & Society, 18 (6), pp. 659-679; Albarracin, D., Zanna, M.P., Johnson, B.T., Kumkale, G.T., Attitudes: Introduction and scope (2005) The handbook of attitudes, pp. 3-19. , In D.

Based on an integrative review of the literature on stereotyping and biased language use, we propose the Social Categories and Stereotypes Communication (SCSC) framework. The framework integrates largely independent areas of literature and explicates the linguistic processes through which social-category stereotypes are shared and maintained. We distinguish two groups of biases in language use that jointly feed and maintain three fundamental cognitive variables in (shared) social-category cognition: perceived category entitativity, stereotype content, and perceived essentialism of associated stereotypic characteristics. These are: (1) Biases in linguistic labels used to denote categories, within which we discuss biases in (a) label content and (b) linguistic form of labels; (2) Biases in describing behaviors and characteristics of categorized individuals, within which we discuss biases in (a) communication content (i.e., what information is communicated), and (b) linguistic form of descriptions (i.e., how is information formulated). Together, these biases create a self-perpetuating cycle in which social-category stereotypes are shared and maintained. The framework allows for a better understanding of stereotype maintaining biases in natural language. We discuss various opportunities for further research. © 2019, Review of Communication Research.",Communication; Discrimination; Entitativity; Essentialism; Language; Linguistic bias; Prejudice; Social categorization; Stereotypes,,,,,,,,"Abelson, R.P., Dasgupta, N., Park, J., Banaji, M.R., Perceptions of the Collective Other (1998) Personality & Social Psychology Review, 2 (4), pp. 243-250; Allport, G.W., (1954) The nature of prejudice, , Cambridge, MA: Addison-Wesley; Amodio, D.M., Devine, P.G., Stereotyping and evaluation in implicit race bias: Evidence for independent constructs and unique effects on behavior (2006) Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 91 (4), pp. 652-661. , https://doi.org/10.1037/0022-3514.91.4.652; Anderson, J.R., The adaptive nature of human categorization (1991) Psychological Review, 98, pp. 409-429; Arendt, F., Dose-Dependent Media Priming Effects of Stereotypic Newspaper Articles on Implicit and Explicit Stereotypes (2013) Journal of Communication, 63 (5), pp. 830-851. , https://doi.org/10.1111/jcom.12056; Arendt, F., Northup, T., Effects of long-term exposure to news stereotypes on implicit and explicit attitudes (2015) International Journal of Communication, 9, p. 21; Assilaméhou, Y., Testé, B., The effects of linguistic abstraction on evaluations of the speaker in an intergroup context: Using the Linguistic Intergroup Bias makes you a good group member (2013) Journal of Experimental Social Psychology, 49 (1), pp. 113-119. , http://doi.org/10.1016/j.jesp.2012.08.001; Attardo, S., Irony as relevant inappropriateness (2000) Journal of Pragmatics, 32 (6), pp. 793-826; Barr, D.J., Kronmüller, E., Conversation as a Site of Category Learning and Category Use (2006) Psychology of Learning and Motivation, 47, pp. 181-211. , In A.

Communication researchers have been investigating avatars for over twenty years, and an examination of this literature reveals similarities but also notable discrepancies in conceptual definitions. The goal of this review is to provide a general overview of current debates, methodological approaches, and trends in findings. Our review synthesizes previous research in four areas. First, we examine how scholars have conceptualized the term ""avatar,"" identify similarities and differences across these definitions, and recommend that scholars use the term consistently. Next, we review theoretical perspectives relevant to avatar perception (e.g., the computers as social actors framework). Then, we examine avatar characteristics that communicators use to discern the humanity and social potential of an avatar (anthropomorphism, form realism, behavioral realism, and perceived agency) and discuss implications for attributions and communication outcomes. We also review findings on the social categorization of avatars, such as when people apply categories like sex, gender, race, and ethnicity to their evaluations of digital representations. Finally, we examine research on avatar selection and design relevant to communication outcomes. Here, we review both motivations in CMC contexts (such as self-presentation and identity expression) and potential effects (e.g., persuasion). We conclude with a discussion of future directions for avatar research and propose that communication researchers consider avatars not just as a topic of study, but also as a tool for testing theories and understanding critical elements of human communication. Avatarmediated environments provide researchers with a number of advantageous technological affordances that can enable manipulations that may be difficult or inadvisable to execute in natural environments. We conclude by discussing the use of avatar research to extend communication theory and our understanding of communication processes. © 2018, Review of Communication Research.",Anthropomorphism; Avatars; Computer-mediated communication; Digital environments; Digital representations; Human-computer interaction; Perception; Social actors; Video games,,,,,,,,"Ahn, S.J., Incorporating immersive virtual environments in health promotion campaigns: A construal level theory approach (2015) Health Communication, 30, pp. 545-556; Ahn, S.J., Bailenson, J.N., Self-endorsing versus other-endorsing in virtual environments (2011) Journal of Advertising, 40, pp. 93-106; Ahn, S.J., Bostick, J., Ogle, E., Nowak, K.L., McGillicuddy, K., Bailenson, J.N., Experiencing nature: Embodying animals in immersive virtual environments increases inclusion of nature in self and involvement with nature (2016) Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication; Ash, E., Priming or Proteus effect?

The content of 211 articles published from 2010 to 2015 in six core communication journals was analyzed to document the design decisions made by the authors concerning their use of theory, sampling, measurement, and experiments. We also recorded the amount of variance explained by their tests and use this indicator of strength of findings to explain the patterns of methodological design decisions. The findings indicate that authors of these studies commonly select weaker design options over stronger ones. The reasons for these patterns are explored then critiqued leading to a series of recommendations calling for an evolution in thinking in the areas of method, theory, and paradigm. The methods recommendations attempt to increase (a) awareness of the advantages and disadvantages of options available for each design decision, (b) an understanding that often assumptions made to justify the selection of an option are faulty, and (c) a commitment to meeting a higher degree of challenges. The theory recommendations focus on increasing an understanding about why designers of most tests of media effects ignore the many theories available when designing their studies. Morover, the paradigm recommendations focus on examining more critically the assumptions we make about the nature of human beings, the purpose of our research as challenges evolve, and the defaults in practices we have established in an exploratory phase. © 2018, Review of Communication Research.",Critical analysis; Design decisions; Development of knowledge; Media effects; Methods,,,,,,,,"Abelson, R.P., A variance explanation paradox: When a little is a lot (1985) Psychological Bulletin, 97, pp. 129-133; Babbie, E., (1992) The practice of social research, 6th edition, , Belmont, CA: Wadsworth; Bargh, J., Chen, M., Burrows, L., Automaticity of social behavior: Direct effects of trait construct and stereotype activation on action (1996) Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 71 (2), pp. 230-244; Bartels, L.M., Messages incoming: The political impact of media exposure (1993) American Political Science Review, 87, pp. 267-285; Barthes, R., Death of the author (1967) Aspen, 5, p. 6; Bartsch, A., As time goes by: What changes and what remains the same in entertainment experience over the life span?

The intent of this essay is to describe how communication, in terms of both the opportunity to talk and the content of what is said, interacts with other ""cooperative mechanisms"" - group identity, reciprocity and equity norms, and trust and trustworthiness - to largely determine individual cooperation versus defection. Two variables with relatively complex impacts on the cooperative mechanisms - social value orientation and group size - are also discussed. A model and set of propositions relating these variables are also included, and areas for further are explored. © 2018, Review of Communication Research.",Communication; Cooperation; Group identity; Group size; Public goods dilemma; Resource dilemma; Social dilemma; Social norms; Social value orientation; Trust; Trustworthiness,,,,,,,,"Alcock, J.E., Mansell, D., Predisposition and behavior in a collective dilemma (1977) Journal of Conflict Resolution, 21 (3), pp. 443-457; Alencar, A.I., Siqueira, J.O., Yamamoto, M.E., Does group size matter?

Before the sections that examine media perceptions and media effects perceptions, we first identify various psychological concepts and processes involved in generating media-related perceptions. In the first section, we analyze two types of media perceptions: media trust/credibility perceptions and bias perceptions, focusing on research on the Hostile Media Perception. In both cases, we address the potential consequences of these perceptions. In the second section, we assess theory and research on perceptions of media effects (often referred to as Presumed Influence) and their consequences (referred to as the Influence of Presumed Influence). As examples of Presumed Influence, we evaluate the literature on the Persuasive Press Inference and the Third-Person Perception. The bodies of research on media perceptions and media effects perceptions have been featured prominently in the top journals of the field of mass communication over the past 20 years. Here we bring them together in one synthetic theoretical review. © 2017 Review of Communication Research.",Hostile media perception; Influence of presumed influence; Media bias; Media credibility; Media effects perceptions; Media perceptions; Media trust; Persuasive press inference; Presumed influence; Third-person perception,,,,,,,,"Ansolabehere, S.D., Iyengar, S., (1995) Going negative: How political advertisements shrink and polarize the electorate, , New York: Free Press; Arpan, L.A., Nabi, R.L., Exploring anger in the hostile media process: Effects on news preferences and source evaluation (2011) Journalism and Mass Communication Quarterly, 88, pp. 5-22; Arpan, L.A., Raney, A.A., An experimental investigation of news source and the hostile media effect (2003) Journalism and Mass Communication Quarterly, 80, pp. 265-281; Ariyanto, A., Hornsey, M.J., Gallois, C., Group allegiances and perceptions of media bias: Taking into account both the perceiver and the source (2007) Group Processes & Intergroup Relations, 10, pp. 266-279; Asch, S.E., Studies of independence and conformity: A minority of one against a unanimous majority (1956) Psychological Monographs, p. 70; Banning, S.A., Taking the third-person effect outside the laboratory: How an unplanned real world event failed to change the third-person effect (2001) Communication Research Reports, 18, pp. 93-103; Banning, S.A., Third-person effects on political participation (2006) Journalism & Mass Communication Quarterly, 83, pp. 785-800; Barnidge, M., Rojas, H., Hostile media perceptions, presumed media media influence, and political talk: Expanding the corrective action hypothesis (2014) International Journal of Public Opinion Research, 26, pp. 135-156; Barnidge, M., Sayre, B., Rojas, H., Perceptions of media and the public and their effects on political participation in Colombia (2015) Mass Communication and Society, 18, pp. 259-280; Beaudoin, C.E., Thorson, E., Credibility perceptions of news coverage of ethnic groups: The predictive roles of race and news use (2005) Howard Journal of Communication, 16, pp. 33-48; Blumler, J.G., McLeod, J.M., Rosengren, K.E., An introduction to comparative communication research (1992) Comparatively speaking: communication and culture across space and time, pp. 3-18. , J.G.

It will describe how music is used to incite intergroup hatred (e.g., among soccer fans, military music) and to support valued identities (anthems, etc.). Relevant literature on stereotyping (including stereotyping of groups related to music) is included. The article also discusses how music is used to reduce intergroup hostility (e.g., via cross-cultural musical collaboration and contact). The article connects the various literatures from communication, social psychology, sociology, and ethnomusicology, providing a broad overview of the many connections between communication, music, and social identity. It closes with a research agenda for those interested in studying intergroup communication and music. © 2017 Review of Communication Research.",Contact; Identity; Intergroup relations; Music; Prejudice,,,,,,,,"Aidi, H.D., (2014) Rebel music: Race, empire, and the new Muslim youth culture, , New York: Vintage; Allport, G.W., (1954) The nature of prejudice, , Cambridge, Mass: Addison-Wesley; Anderson, C.A., Carnagey, N.L., Eubanks, J., Exposure to violent media: The effects of songs with violent lyrics on aggressive thoughts and feelings (2003) Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 84 (5), pp. 960-971; Armstrong, G., Young, M., Fanatical football chants: Creating and controlling the carnival (1999) Culture, Sport, Society, 2 (3), pp. 173-211; Aubrey, J.S., Frisby, C.M., Sexual objectification in music videos: A content analysis comparing gender and genre (2011) Mass Communication and Society, 14 (4), pp. 475-501; Aubrey, J.S., Gerding, A., The cognitive tax of self-objectification: Examining sexually objectifying music videos and female emerging adults' cognitive processing of subsequent advertising (2014) Journal of Media Psychology, 27, pp. 22-32; Aubrey, J.S., Hopper, K.M., Mbure, W.G., Check that body!
