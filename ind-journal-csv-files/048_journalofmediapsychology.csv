Perceptions of exemplar typicality and beliefs about older adults' driving ability were assessed. The results support a curvilinear model in which there is a point, or ""sweet spot,"" where exemplars are perceived as typical enough of their group to be seen as cognitively related and relevant to perceptions of the group, but still atypical enough to change perceptions and beliefs. We discuss implications of these findings for group-related cognitions, subtyping, and media depictions of older adults. © 2019 Hogrefe Publishing.",counterstereotypes; media; older adults; stereotypes; typicality,,,,,,,,,"Bandura, A., (1986) Social Foundations of Thought and Action: A Social Cognitive Theory, , Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice-Hall; Bodenhausen, G., Schwarz, N., Bless, H., Wänke, M., Effects of atypical exemplars on racial beliefs: Enlightened racism or generalized appraisals?

However, with news organizations increasingly shifting their comment sections to social network sites (SNS), questions arise about whether this alters previously observed effects. Instead of encountering comments below the line, SNS provoke a reversed direction of exposure, suggesting that comments might be read before the news article. Addressing the implications of this shift in direction of exposure, we conducted a preregistered experiment with German participants (N = 630), in which we varied comment presentation order (before vs. after the article) and comment valence (positive vs. negative) and assessed how these factors influence the way individuals perceive the journalistic quality of commented news articles. The data provide evidence for a negativity bias and presentation order effects, with negative comments showing distinct effects on quality perceptions, particularly when presented after the article. © 2019 Hogrefe Publishing.",journalistic quality; negativity bias; online news; presentation order; user comments,,,,,,,,,"Baumeister, R.F., Bratslavsky, E., Finkenauer, C., Vohs, K.D., Bad is stronger than good (2001) Review of General Psychology, 5 (4), pp. 323-370; Blanchette, I., Richards, A., The influence of affect on higher level cognition: A review of research on interpretation, judgement, decision making and reasoning (2010) Cognition and Emotion, 24 (4), pp. 561-595; Buchanan, T., Aggressive priming online: Facebook adverts can prime aggressive cognitions (2015) Computers in Human Behavior, 48, pp. 323-330; Cacioppo, J.T., Petty, R.E., The need for cognition (1982) Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 42 (1), pp. 116-131; Chen, G.M., Ng, Y.M.M., Third-person perception of online comments: Civil ones persuade you more than me (2016) Computers in Human Behavior, 55, pp. 736-742; Coe, K., Kenski, K., Rains, S.A., Online and uncivil?

The present study examined the relationship between habitual violent video game play and responses in this shooting paradigm. Habitual violent video game play has been shown to increase the accessibility of aggressive thoughts. Previous research also demonstrated that action video game play has a positive impact on perceptual skills. Hence, it was hypothesized that players of violent video games would be more likely to mistakenly shoot a target and exhibit shorter reaction times in the shooting task. Results revealed that reaction times, but not error rates, were significantly associated with habitual violent video game play. These findings suggest that habitual violent video game play may have a positive impact on overall processing skills without limiting accuracy. © 2019 Hogrefe Publishing.",aggression; shooting task; video games,,,,,,,,,"Anderson, C.A., Carnagey, N.L., Flanagan, M., Benjamin, A.J., Eubanks, J., Valentine, J.C., Violent video games: Specific effects of violent content on aggressive thoughts and behavior (2004) Advances in Experimental Social Psychology, 36, pp. 199-249; Anderson, C.A., Shibuya, A., Ihori, N., Swing, E.L., Bushman, B.J., Sakamoto, A., Saleem, A., Violent video game effects on aggression, empathy, and prosocial behavior in Eastern and Western countries (2010) Psychological Bulletin, 136, pp. 151-173; Barlett, C., Branch, O., Rodeheffer, C., Harris, R., How long do the short-term violent video game effects last?

Informed by the literature on news framing and self-categorization theory, we hypothesize that the media's focus on partisan conflict increases partisans' perceptions of public polarization, which fuels partisan attitude polarization on disputed issues in news coverage. Study 1 supports this contention in the political domain. By retesting the hypotheses in a gender context, Study 2 further demonstrates that the impact of conflict news framing on attitude polarization is not simply due to preexisting political polarization.

At the heart of this challenge is the question: ""To what extent can liking be independent of character morality? "" The current study examines this question with a 2 (Disposition: Positive vs. Negative) × 3 (Character Type: Hero, Antihero, Villain) between-subjects factorial experiment that induces variance in liking and morality. We assess the influence of these orthogonal manipulations on measured liking and morality. Main effects of both manipulations on the measured variables emerged, with a significant correlation between measures. Regression analyses further confirm that liking is associated with perceived morality and vice versa. Because variance in morality was induced by the liking manipulation and variance in liking was induced by the morality manipulation, the assumptions of disposition theory regarding morality and liking seem accurate.

Extending prior theory and research, our focus was on assimilation effects (i.e., changes in self-perception in line with a protagonist s traits) as well as on contrast effects (i.e., changes in self-perception in contrast to a protagonist s traits). In Experiment 1 (N = 113), implicit and explicit conscientiousness were assessed after participants read a story about either a diligent or a negligent student. Moderation analyses showed that highly transported participants and participants with lower counterarguing scores assimilate the depicted traits of a story protagonist, as indicated by explicit, self-reported conscientiousness ratings. Participants, who were more critical toward a story (i.e., higher counterarguing) and with a lower degree of transportation, showed contrast effects. In Experiment 2 (N = 103), we manipulated transportation and counterarguing, but we could not identify an effect on participants self-ascribed level of conscientiousness. A mini meta-analysis across both experiments revealed significant positive overall associations between transportation and counterarguing on the one hand and story-consistent self-reported conscientiousness on the other hand. © 2019 Hogrefe Publishing.",assimilation; contrast; narratives; self; transportation,,,,,,,,,"Aiken, L.S., West, S.G., Reno, R.R., (1991) Multiple Regression: Testing and Interpreting Interactions, , London, UK: Sage; Appel, M., A story about a stupid person can make you act stupid (or smart): Behavioral assimilation (and contrast) as narrative impact (2011) Media Psychology, 14, pp. 144-167; Appel, M., Gnambs, T., Richter, T., Green, M.C., The Transportation Scale - Short Form (TS-SF) (2015) Media Psychology, 18, pp. 243-266; Cohen, J., Statistical power analysis (1992) Current Directions in Psychological Science, 1, pp. 98-101; Cohen, J., Defining identification: A theoretical look at the identification of audiences with media characters (2001) Mass Communication and Society, 4, pp. 245-264; (2014) Biostat, , http://www.comprehensive.com, Comprehensive Meta-Analysis (Version 2) [Computer software]..

What are the behavioral consequences of these emotions? Using an online experiment, this study examined the effects of abnormality perception on how people make cognitive and affective assessments of a negative social event. We found that content abnormality (i.e., an unusual/unexpected event) perceived in news stories leads people to attribute less responsibility to the victim and experience stronger emotional responses (i.e., anger and sadness). This in turn increases the desire for a stronger punishment toward the perpetrator. Syntactic abnormality (i.e., negation) indirectly influenced punitive judgment by increasing the responsibility attributed to the offender. The use of negation as the dominant sentence structure (syntactic abnormality) reduced prosocial intentions, but only when the news story was depicted as an abnormal occurrence (content abnormality). These findings illuminate the interconnections between abnormality perception, emotion, and judgment. © 2020 Hogrefe Publishing.",abnormality perception; emotion; empathic behavior; negation; responsibility attribution,,,,,,,,,"Anastasio, P.A., Costa, D.M., Twice hurt: How newspaper coverage may reduce empathy and engender blame for female victims of crime (2004) Sex Roles, 51 (9-10), pp. 535-542; Arkkelin, D., Oakley, T., Mynatt, C.R., Effects of controllable versus uncontrollable factors on responsibility attributions: A single-subject approach (1979) Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 37 (1), pp. 110-115; Bagozzi, R.P., Moore, D.J., Public service advertisements: Emotions and empathy guide prosocial behavior (1994) The Journal of Marketing, 58 (1), pp. 56-70; Bodenhausen, G.V., Sheppard, L.A., Kramer, G.P., Negative affect and social judgment: The differential impact of anger and sadness (1994) European Journal of Social Psychology, 24 (1), pp. 45-62; Cialdini, R.B., Reno, R.R., Kallgren, C.A., A focus theory of normative conduct: Recycling the concept of norms to reduce littering in public places (1990) Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 58 (6), pp. 1015-1026; Clark, H.H., (1996) Using Language, , Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press; Coleman, J.C., (1950) Abnormal Psychology and Modern Life, , Glenview, IL: Scott, Foresman; David, P., Role of imagery in recall of deviant news (1996) Journalism & Mass Communication Quarterly, 73 (4), pp. 804-820; Deutsch, R., Gawronski, B., Strack, F., At the boundaries of automaticity: Negation as reflective operation (2006) Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 91 (3), pp. 385-405; Diakopoulos, N., Zubiaga, A., Newsworthiness and network gatekeeping on twitter: The role of social deviance (2014) Proceedings of the 8th International Conference on Weblogs and Social Media ICWSM 2014, pp. 587-590. , (p).

This experiment tested the common ingroup identity model and how the creation of a superordinate identity among characters in a television narrative influences viewers' willingness to interact with outgroup members and attitudes toward the outgroup. Results reveal that self-efficacy, anxiety, and inclusion of the outgroup in the self mediated the relationship between exposure to narratives featuring intergroup interdependence and both positive attitudes toward and greater willingness to interact with the outgroup. That is, participants who watched a narrative featuring high levels of intergroup teamwork reported increased feelings of self-efficacy when considering future outgroup interactions, which was associated with lower levels of outgroup anxiety. Lower levels of anxiety were then associated with increased inclusion of the outgroup in the self, which was ultimately associated with more positive attitudes toward and greater willingness to interact with the outgroup. These results suggest that, even when comparing the effects of two narratives that portray an identical, positive outcome, positive effects on attitudes toward and willingness to interact with outgroup members are stronger when ingroup and outgroup members display interdependence.

Despite its prevalence in media psychology, limited work has examined suspense from a media neuroscience perspective, and thus the biological underpinnings of suspense remain unknown. Here we examine continuous brain responses of 494 viewers watching a suspenseful movie. To create a time-resolved measure of the degree to which a movie aligns audience-wide brain responses, we computed dynamic inter-subject correlations of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) time series among all viewers using sliding-window analysis. In parallel, we captured in-the-moment reports of suspense in an independent sample via continuous response measurement (CRM). We found that dynamic inter-subject correlations over the course of the movie tracked well with the reported suspense in the CRM sample, particularly in regions associated with emotional salience and higher cognitive processes. These results are compatible with theoretical views on motivated attention and psychological tension. The finding that fMRI-based audience response measurement relates to audience reports of suspense creates new opportunities for research on the mechanisms of suspense and other entertainment phenomena and has applied potential for measuring audience responses in a nonreactive and objective fashion. © 2020 Hogrefe Publishing.",fMRI; inter-subject correlation; media neuroscience; suspense,,,,,,,,,"Abraham, A., Pedregosa, F., Eickenberg, M., Gervais, P., Mueller, A., Kossaifi, J., Varoquaux, G., Machine learning for neuroimaging with scikit-learn (2014) Frontiers in Neuroinformatics, 8, p. 14; Adolphs, R., Anderson, D., (2018) The Neuroscience of Emotion, , Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press; Barnett, S.B., Cerf, M., A ticket for your thoughts: Method for predicting content recall and sales using neural similarity of moviegoers (2017) The Journal of Consumer Research, 44, pp. 160-181; Benjamini, Y., Yekutieli, D., The control of the false discovery rate in multiple testing under dependency (2001) The Annals of Statistics, 29, pp. 1165-1188; Berridge, K.C., Affective valence in the brain: Modules or modes?

In a between-subjects experiment, we disentangled the effects of display type (VR vs. computer screen) and biofeedback (electrodermal activity biofeedback vs. no biofeedback) in the context of immersive simulated relaxation environments. After a stress induction, 94 healthy participants were randomly assigned to one of four relaxing treatments. There were no treatment-specific differences in subjective stress or physiological arousal. However, VR compared with computer screen increased the sense of presence and, partly, perceived restorativeness. When combined with VR, biofeedback increased physical presence and, in part, perceived restorativeness. The study offers insight that allows for the identification of future research avenues. © 2020 Hogrefe Publishing.",biofeedback; perceived restorativeness; relaxation; sense of presence; virtual reality,,,,,,,,,"Anderson, A.P., Mayer, M.D., Fellows, A.M., Cowan, D.R., Hegel, M.T., Buckey, J.C., Relaxation with immersive natural scenes presented using virtual reality (2017) Aerospace Medicine and Human Performance, 88, pp. 520-526; Annerstedt, M., Jönsson, P., Wallergård, M., Johansson, G., Karlson, B., Grahn, P., Währborg, P., Inducing physiological stress recovery with sounds of nature in a virtual reality forest - Results from a pilot study (2013) Physiology & Behavior, 118, pp. 240-250; Baños, R.M., Etchemendy, E., Castilla, D., Garcia-Palacios, A., Quero, S., Botella, C., Positive mood induction procedures for virtual environments designed for elderly people (2012) Interacting with Computers, 24, pp. 131-138; Bohil, C.J., Alicea, B., Biocca, F.A., Virtual reality in neuroscience research and therapy (2011) Nature Reviews Neuroscience, 12, pp. 752-762; Boucsein, W., (2012) Electrodermal Activity, , Berlin, Germany: Springer Science & Business Media; Collado, S., Staats, H., Corraliza, J.A., Hartig, T., (2017) Handbook of Environmental Psychology and Quality of Life Research, pp. 127-148. , Restorative environments and health.

Based on the capacity model (Fisch, 2000), a more precise processing variable called engagement with the science content was proposed as an additional mechanism that can account for variance not explained by existing narrative engagement variables. Results of a between-subjects experiment showed that watching a science-related narrative increased all three science outcomes. Engagement with the science content explained significantly more variance in posttest interest and information-seeking than did narrative engagement or transportation. Science knowledge was acquired regardless of preexisting level of interest, demonstrating the benefits of popular entertainment narratives in fostering informal science learning among nonexpert audiences. © 2020 Hogrefe Publishing.",entertainment narrative; Fisch's capacity model; informal science learning; science communication,,,,,,,,,"Allum, N., Sturgis, P., Tabourazi, D., Brunton-Smith, I., Science knowledge and attitudes across cultures: A meta-analysis (2008) Public Understanding of Science, 17, pp. 35-54; (2009) Learning Science in Informal Environments: People, Places, and Pursuits, , Bell, P., Lewenstein, B., Shouse, A.

Online discussions, promotional materials, and reviews can all potentially reveal pertinent information about story plotlines, presumably ruining suspense and enjoyment. Despite these common apprehensions, recent experimental evidence suggests that narrative spoilers have modest and inconsistent effects on enjoyment and other audience responses. In this study, we investigate the implications of spoilers for horror films, a genre reliant on suspenseful thrills. Each participant was exposed to multiple scenes from a single horror film, and spoilers were manipulated at different stages of the narrative for both minor and major plot points. Results indicate no main effects of spoilers for enjoyment, transportation, suspense, processing fluency, or reactance. However, need for affect moderated positive enjoyment effects of spoilers for smaller plot points such as scary moments or sudden twists. These results indicate that those who value the thrills of horror films may receive enjoyment from the anticipation produced by minor spoilers about smaller plot points. © 2018 Hogrefe Publishing.",enjoyment; horror film; narrative; processing fluency; spoilers,,,,,,,,,"Appel, M., Gnambs, T., Maio, G.R., A short measure of the need for affect (2012) Journal of Personality Assessment, 94, pp. 418-426; (1926) Poetics (1450b27), , http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Aristot.+Poet.+1450b, Aristotle.., [W.

The current study examines the association between distinct aspects of video game play behavior and adolescent adjustment. We focused on five aspects, namely, gaming frequency, the social context, gamer identification, type of game, and motivation for playing. Participants included 705 Dutch adolescents (33.5% female, Mage = 14.07), who completed a survey including self-report and sociometric measures. Results indicated that the frequency of playing games was not associated with adolescent adjustment. However, significant associations did appear for social context, genre of games, and motivation for playing. In addition, the different aspects of gaming showed both beneficial and deleterious relations with adjustment. This research indicates the importance of disaggregating gaming behavior and the necessity to look beyond frequency of play in order to fully understand the impact of gaming on youth. © 2018 Hogrefe Publishing.",adolescence; adolescent adjustment; digital games; video game play behavior,,,,,,"Behavioural Science institute, Radboud University, BSI",This research was supported by the Behavioural Science Institute at Radboud University.,,"Aarsand, P., The ordinary player: Teenagers talk about digital games (2012) Journal of Youth Studies, 15, pp. 961-977; Adachi, P.J.C., Willoughby, T., The longitudinal association between competitive video game play and aggression among adolescents and young adults (2016) Child Development, 87, pp. 1877-1892; Allahverdipour, H., Bazargan, M., Farhadinasab, A., Moeini, B., Correlates of video games playing among adolescents in an Islamic country (2010) BMC Public Health, 10, pp. 1-7; Anderson, C.A., Shibuya, A., Ihori, N., Swing, E.L., Bushman, B.J., Sakamoto, A., Saleem, M., Violent video game effects on aggression, empathy, and prosocial behavior in Eastern and Western countries: A meta-analytic review (2010) Psychological Bulletin, 136, pp. 151-173; Brooks, F.M., Chester, K.L., Smeeton, N.C., Spencer, N.H., Video gaming in adolescence: Factors associated with leisure time use (2016) Journal of Youth Studies, 19, pp. 36-54; Casiano, H., Kinley, D.J., Katz, L.Y., Chartier, M.J., Sareen, J., Media use and health outcomes in adolescents: Findings from a nationally representative survey (2012) Journal of the Canadian Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, 21, pp. 296-301; Colwell, J., Kato, M., Investigation of the relationship between social isolation, self-esteem, aggression and computer game play in Japanese adolescents (2003) Asian Journal of Social Psychology, 6, pp. 149-158; Colwell, J., Payne, J., Negative correlates of computer game play in adolescents (2000) British Journal of Psychology, 91, pp. 295-310; De Grove, F., Courtois, C., Van Looy, J., How to be a gamer!

Regarding its causes, the experimental studies (N1 = 399; N2 = 337) found that features of television reports (e.g., footage used, background music) can heighten perceptions of processing fluency. Regarding its consequences, it was found that heightened perceived fluency biases metacognitive judgments. Specifically, considering perceived knowledge in relation to actual knowledge, recipients experiencing fluency have been found to overestimate their knowledge about the issue depicted in the experimental stimuli. The resulting illusion of knowing was particularly pronounced under conditions of low involvement, indicating that the so-called ease-of-processing heuristic underlies the effect. © 2018 Hogrefe Publishing.",illusion of knowing; knowledge acquisition; perceived knowledge; processing fluency,,,,,,,,,"Alter, A.L., Oppenheimer, D.M., Predicting short-term stock fluctuations by using processing fluency (2006) Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 103, pp. 9369-9372; Alter, A.L., Oppenheimer, D.M., Easy on the mind, easy on the wallet: The roles of familiarity and processing fluency in valuation judgments (2008) Psychonomic Bulletin & Review, 15, pp. 985-990; Alter, A.L., Oppenheimer, D.M., Uniting the tribes of fluency to form a metacognitive nation (2009) Personality and Social Psychology Review, 13, pp. 219-235; Alter, A.L., Oppenheimer, D.M., Epley, N., Eyre, R.N., Overcoming intuition: Metacognitive difficulty activates analytic reasoning (2007) Journal of Experimental Psychology: General, 136, pp. 569-576; Brosius, H.B., Donsbach, W., Birk, M., How do text-picture relations affect the informational effectiveness of television newscasts?

The present study, relying on the cognitive-behavioral model of PIU (Brand, Young, &amp; Laier, 2014; Davis, 2001) and self-determination theory (Deci &amp; Ryan, 2000), investigated the extent to which coping strategies in aversive situations and mindfulness during Internet use serve as mediating mechanisms in the relation between need satisfaction and generalized PIU (GPIU; dependency on multiple functions of the Internet). Path analysis on a sample of 165 Turkish early adolescents (M age = 12.88, SD =.83; 49.1% females) found that need satisfaction was negatively related to PIU via low avoidant coping and high mindfulness in Internet engagement. The findings support the pathways from disadvantageous social context to GPIU suggested by Brand and colleagues' (2014) model of GPIU and additionally show that next to avoidant coping, online mindfulness, an indicator of loss of cognitive control, can be a proximal correlate of GPIU. Interventions for adolescents' harmonious Internet use could focus, among others, on adolescents' need satisfaction, awareness of coping strategies, and development of online mindfulness. © 2017 Hogrefe Publishing.",coping; early adolescents; generalized problematic Internet use; need satisfaction; online mindfulness,,,,,,,,,"Amirkhan, J.H., A factor analytically derived measure of coping: The coping strategy indicator (1990) Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 59, pp. 1066-1074; Aysan, F., Validity and reliability of coping strategy scale for university students (1994) Proceedings of the First Educational Sciences Congress, pp. 1158-1169. , April.

The current study focused on empirically testing these theoretical gaps and sampled over 3,000 Singaporean youth participants (at Wave 1) who completed measures of cyberbullying behavior and positive attitudes consecutively for 3 years. Correlations and path analyses showed modest stability in positive cyberbullying attitudes and perpetration over time. Also, latent class analysis classified participants into either stable high attitudes, stable low attitudes, increasing attitudes, or decreasing attitudes. Results using this classification showed that changes in positive cyberbullying attitudes across Waves 1 and 2 predicted Wave 3 cyberbullying, such that those who endorsed cyberbullying attitudes were more likely to cyberbully than those who did not advocate such attitudes. Finally, path analysis results showed significant longitudinal cross-lags between positive attitudes toward cyberbullying and behaviors. © 2017 Hogrefe Publishing.",cyberbully; cyberbullying attitudes,,,,,,,,,"Ajzen, I., Fishbein, M., Attitude-behavior relations: A theoretical analysis and review of empirical research (1977) Psychological Bulletin, 84, pp. 888-918;

The current research, by adopting a construal level theory approach, examined whether psychological distance cues within online messages influence message processing. According to construal level theory, spatial and hypothetical distances (i.e., probabilities, likelihoods) share an association based on psychological distance. Construal level literature suggests that people overgeneralize this association and attribute unlikely events to distant places and likely events to close-by places. The current research provides a novel test of this relationship in an online communication setting. In two within-subjects experiments (Studies 1 and 2), we presented participants tweets depicting likely and unlikely events, and measured whether they attribute them to spatially close or far sources. Confirming our predictions, participants utilized the psychological distance cues and attributed the likely tweets to spatially close and the unlikely tweets to spatially far sources. In two follow-up experiments, we tested the same relationship by employing between-subjects designs. In Study 3 where participants saw one spatial distance and both likely and unlikely tweets, participants formed the same association albeit less strongly and attributed the unlikely tweets to spatially distant sources. In Study 4, where participants saw two spatial distances and only one tweet, the expected association was not formed. Findings suggest that comparison of likelihood information is necessary to form an association between source location and tweet likelihood. The implications of psychological distance and a construal level theory approach are discussed in the context of online heuristics and persuasion. © 2017 Hogrefe Publishing.",construal level theory; online heuristics; probability; psychological distance; spatial distance,,,,,,,,,"Alter, A.L., Oppenheimer, D.M., Effects of fluency on psychological distance and mental construal (or why New York is a large city, but New York is a civilized jungle) (2008) Psychological Science, 19 (2), pp. 161-167; Alter, A.L., Oppenheimer, D.M., Uniting the tribes of fluency to form a metacognitive nation (2009) Personality and Social Psychology Review, 13, pp. 219-235; Backstrom, L., Sun, E., Marlow, C., Find me if you can: Improving geographical prediction with social and spatial proximity (2010) Proceedings of the 19th International Conference on World Wide Web, Raleigh, NC, USA, pp. 61-70. , New York, NY: ACM, doi; Bar-Anan, Y., Liberman, N., Trope, Y., The association between psychological distance and construal level: Evidence from an Implicit Association Test (2006) Journal of Experimental Psychology: General, 135 (4), pp. 609-622; Bar-Anan, Y., Liberman, N., Trope, Y., Algom, D., Automatic processing of psychological distance: Evidence from a Stroop task (2007) Journal of Experimental Psychology: General, 136 (4), p. 610; Buhrmester, M., Kwang, T., Gosling, S.D., Amazon's Mechanical Turk a new source of inexpensive, yet high-quality, data?

Past research indicates that media portrayals of distant suffering can promote helping behavior by eliciting sympathy, while those that prompt a more rational response tend to decrease helping behavior by undermining sympathy. The authors used an online experiment to test whether certain media frames could promote helping behavior through a more rational, rather than emotional, pathway. The study tested whether framing distant suffering as either solvable or unsolvable might promote helping behavior if a rational evaluation of a crisis leads one to determine that help is efficacious in solving the problem. Survey respondents were randomly assigned to read one of three messages: a high solvability message, a low solvability message, or a control message. Contrary to expectations, both low solvability and high solvability conditions increased participants' intentions to help. The results suggest that this is because framing problems as unsolvable drives up sympathy, thus promoting willingness to help, while framing problems as solvable drives up perceived efficacy, also promoting willingness to help. The authors conclude that, in contrast to earlier studies, and to the assumptions of many of those working in media, emphasizing rationality can promote helping behavior if audiences rationally interpret the problem as solvable. Implications of the findings for ethically portraying distant suffering in the media are discussed. © 2017 Hogrefe Publishing.",distant suffering; efficacy; news framing; solvability; sympathy,,,,,,,,,"Bandura, A., (1986) Social Foundations of Thought and Action: A Social Cognitive Theory, , Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice Hall; Batson, C.D., Polycarpou, M.P., Harmon-Jones, E., Imhoff, H.J., Mitchener, E.C., Bednar, L.L., Highberger, L., Empathy and attitudes: Can feeling for a member of a stigmatized group improve feelings toward the group?

What happens, however, when preceding media activate viewers' moral emotions? Can the affective states associated with elevation decrease subsequent enjoyment of media violence? The current study examined these questions with a one-factor, between-subjects experiment that tested how prior exposure to eudaimonic media affects viewers' violence enjoyment and prosocial attitudes. Feelings of meaningful affect elicited by eudaimonic media decreased viewers' enjoyment of violent media and increased prosocial attitudes. Evidence for a boomerang effect through mixed affect and transportation was also found. The implications of these findings for media violence interventions and theory on enjoyment are discussed. © 2017 Hogrefe Publishing.",elevation; eudaimonic; media enjoyment; moral disengagement; transportation,,,,,,,,,"Bailey, E., Wojdynski, B.W., Effects of ""meaningful"" entertainment on altruistic behavior: Investigating potential mediators (2015) Journal of Broadcasting & Electronic Media, 59 (4), pp. 603-619; Bentler, P., Chou, C., Practical issues in structural modeling (1987) Sociological Methods and Research, 16 (1), pp. 78-117; Cantor, J., Wilson, B.J., Media and violence: Intervention strategies for reducing aggression (2003) Media Psychology, 5 (4), pp. 363-403; Dill, J.C., Anderson, C.A., Effects of frustration justification on hostile aggression (1995) Aggressive Behavior, 21, pp. 359-369; Festinger, L., (1962) A Theory of Cognitive Dissonance, , Stanford, CA: Stanford University Press; Green, M.C., Brock, T.C., Kaufman, G.F., Understanding media enjoyment: The role of transportation into narrative worlds (2004) Communication Theory, 14 (4), pp. 311-327; Haidt, J., The positive emotion of elevation (2000) Prevention and Treatment, 3 (1), pp. 1-5; Hartmann, T., Krakowiak, K.M., Tsay-Vogel, M., How violent video games communicate violence: A literature review and content analysis of moral disengagement factors (2014) Communication Monographs, 81 (3), pp. 310-332; Krakowiak, K.M., Oliver, M.B., When good characters do bad things: Examining the effect of moral ambiguity on enjoyment (2012) Journal of Communication, 62 (1), pp. 117-135; Krämer, N., Eimler, S.C., Neubaum, G., Winter, S., Rösner, L., Oliver, M.B., Broadcasting one world: How watching online videos can elicit elevation and reduce stereotypes (2016) New Media and Society, , Advance online publication; Oliver, M.B., Mood management and selective exposure (2003) Communication and Emotion: Essays in Honor of Dolf Zillman, pp. 85-106. , J.

To examine this, a field experiment was conducted in which participants (n = 197) used a digital magazine with either (a) external communication features (facilitating social interactions on external platforms, like Facebook), (b) internal communication features (facilitating social interactions within the digital magazine itself), or (c) no communication features. Results revealed that both feature types increased consumers' interactivity perceptions, but that the effects of the internal communication features were the strongest. Subsequently, mediation analyses revealed that the higher levels of perceived interactivity elicited stronger feelings of flow and enjoyment through which the positive findings of perceived interactivity on consumers' attitudinal responses can be explained. © 2019 Hogrefe Publishing.",digital magazines; flow experience; perceived enjoyment; perceived interactivity,,,,,,,,,"Barzilai, S., Blau, I., Scaffolding game-based learning: Impact on learning achievements, perceived learning, and game experiences (2014) Computers & Education, 70, pp. 65-79; Bridges, E., Florsheim, R., Hedonic and utilitarian shopping goals: The online experience (2008) Journal of Business Research, 61 (4), pp. 309-314; Bucy, E.P., Tao, C.C., The mediated moderation model of interactivity (2007) Media Psychology, 9 (3), pp. 647-672; Chen, H., Wigand, R.T., Nilan, M., Exploring web users' optimal flow experiences (2000) Information Technology & People, 13 (4), pp. 263-281; Childers, T.L., Carr, C.L., Peck, J., Carson, S., Hedonic and utilitarian motivations for online retail shopping behavior (2001) Journal of Retailing, 77 (4), pp. 511-535; Consterdine, G., (2014) Proof of performance: Making the case for magazine media, , http://fipp.s3.amazonaws.com/media/documents/ef2c2981-3654-4878-8888-58c6ddd86e79.pdf, Retrieved from; Crites, S.L., Fabrigar, L.R., Petty, R.E., Measuring the affective and cognitive properties of attitudes: Conceptual and methodological issues (1994) Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, 20 (6), pp. 619-634; Csikszentmihalyi, M., Play and intrinsic rewards (1975) Journal of Humanistic Psychology, 15 (3), pp. 41-63; Cyr, D., Head, M., Ivanov, A., Perceived interactivity leading to e-loyalty: Development of a model for cognitive-affective user responses (2009) International Journal of Human-Computer Studies, 67 (10), pp. 850-869; Chung, D.S., Interactive features of online newspapers: Identifying patterns and predicting use of engaged readers (2008) Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication, 13 (3), pp. 658-679; Davis, F.D., Bagozzi, R.P., Warshaw, P.R., Extrinsic and intrinsic motivation to use computers in the workplace (1992) Journal of Applied Social Psychology, 22 (14), pp. 1111-1132; Hayes, A.F., (2017) PROCESS: Introduction to mediation, moderation, and conditional process analysis.

A survey was conducted with 319 undergraduates about their passive Facebook use, their frequency of making upward social comparisons on Facebook, the emotions evoked through these comparisons, and their levels of depression. Half of the participants were given questions about the Facebook comparisons they made with their close friends, while the other half were given questions about the Facebook comparisons they made with acquaintances. Analysis of the whole sample revealed that upward Facebook comparison elicited assimilative emotions (inspiration, optimism, and admiration) more than contrastive emotions did (envy and resentment). A path model was developed in which passive use of Facebook predicted the frequency of making upward social comparisons, and, in turn, the frequency of making upward Facebook comparisons predicted depression through two routes: One through contrastive emotions and other through assimilative emotions. The results suggested that the model fits the data. As expected, the frequency of upward Facebook comparisons was associated with the increases in frequency of both contrastive and assimilative emotions, and the associations of these two types of emotions with depression were in opposite directions: Depression increased as the frequency of contrastive emotions increased, and it decreased as the frequency of assimilative emotions increased. The strength of the latter aforementioned association was stronger when the comparison targets were acquaintances rather than close friends. © 2019 Hogrefe Publishing.",depression; emotions; passive Facebook use; upward comparison,,,,,,,,,"Appel, H., Gerlach, A.L., Crusius, J., The interplay between Facebook use, social comparison, envy, and depression (2016) Current Opinion in Psychology, 9, pp. 44-49; Aron, A., Aron, E.N., Smollan, D., Inclusion of other in the self scale and the structure of interpersonal closeness (1992) Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 63 (4), p. 596; Banjanin, N., Banjanin, N., Dimitrijevic, I., Pantic, I., Relationship between internet use and depression: Focus on physiological mood oscillations, social networking and online addictive behavior (2015) Computers in Human Behavior, 43, pp. 308-312; Bessiere, K., Kiesler, S., Kraut, R., Boneva, B.S., Effects of Internet use and social resources on changes in depression (2008) Information, Community & Society, 11 (1), pp. 47-70; Burke, M., Marlow, C., Lento, T., (2010) Proceedings of the CHI 2010: Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems, Atlanta, GA, pp. 1902-1912. , Social network activity and social well-being.

Researchers have thus far largely neglected, however, to examine the tendency to avoid attitude-discrepant information, that is, selective avoidance. Selective avoidance can be considered a different phenomenon that is not necessarily implied by, nor only occurs simultaneously with, selective exposure. This study investigates these two separate phenomena, for the first time, using eye-tracking methodology. We exposed participants to political ads by liberal and conservative parties placed next to neutral political ads and tracked eye movements unobtrusively. Findings showed that individuals paid more visual attention to political ads that were consistent with their partisan ideology. Additionally, we found that individuals tended to avoid political ads that were inconsistent with their partisan ideology, which provides some evidence for selective avoidance processes. Theoretical and practical implications of these findings are discussed. © 2019 Hogrefe Publishing.",eye-tracking; partisan ideology; political advertising; selective avoidance; selective exposure,,,,,,,,,"Cotton, J.L., Cognitive dissonance in selective exposure (1985) Selective exposure to communication, pp. 11-33. , In D.

Japanese undergraduate students (N = 199) received one message supporting whale-fishery competition with another message opposing it (the conflicting-message condition), arguing against the public demand for whale meat (the competing-message condition), or taking a neutral stance on whaling (the unbalanced-message condition). Although the conflicting and competing messages (vs. the unbalanced messages) had no effect on support for the government's whaling policy, participants in the conflicting-message condition produced more thoughts about whale-fishery competition, had a more moderate belief about the issue, and perceived the importance of the belief to be lower than participants in the competing- and unbalanced-message conditions. These results suggest that messages organized by conflicting frames have unique effects on the availability, accessibility, and applicability of frame-relevant or -congruent beliefs. © 2019 Hogrefe Publishing.",beliefs; competing frames; conflicting frames; emphasis framing effects; opinions,,,,,,,,,"Aklin, M., Urpelainen, J., Debating clean energy: Frames, counter frames, and audiences (2013) Global Environmental Change, 23 (5), pp. 1225-1232; Antilla, L., Climate of scepticism: US newspaper coverage of the science of climate change (2005) Global Environmental Change, 15 (4), pp. 338-352; Bailey, J.L., Norway, the United States, and commercial whaling: Political culture and social movement framing (2009) Journal of Environment & Development, 18 (1), pp. 79-102; Blok, A., Contesting global norms: Politics of identity in Japanese pro-whaling countermobilization (2008) Global Environmental Politics, 8 (2), pp. 39-66; Borah, P., Conceptual issues in framing theory: A systematic examination of a decade's literature (2011) Journal of Communication, 61 (2), pp. 246-263; Borah, P., Seeking more information and conversations: Influence of competitive frames and motivated processing (2011) Communication Research, 38 (3), pp. 303-325; Brewer, P.R., Framing, value words, and citizens' explanations of their issue opinions (2002) Political Communication, 19 (3), pp. 303-316; Brewer, P.R., Gross, K., Values, framing, and citizens' thoughts about policy issues: Effects on content and quantity (2005) Political Psychology, 26 (6), pp. 929-948; Bullock, J.G., Green, D.P., Ha, S.E., Yes, but what's the mechanism?

A cluster randomized controlled trial was completed among 704 children (7-12 years old) in schools. The schools were allocated to either the intervention group (n = 399) or control group (n = 305). Both short-term (directly after the intervention) and long-term effects (3 months after the end of the intervention) were measured. Bayesian mixed-effect analyses showed positive short- and long-term effects of the intervention on children's understanding of advertising's tactics. Structural equation analysis showed that the intervention-induced changes in children's understanding of advertising's tactics were not related to any changes in their use of advertising coping strategies or their advertising susceptibility. No other intervention effects were found. However, structural equation analyses showed that, regardless of the intervention, motivation and ability to use advertising coping strategies are both associated with children's actual coping behavior. These findings indicate that motivation and ability to effectively use advertising coping strategies are important empowering factors that should be taken into account in future research on children's advertising coping behavior and in advertising intervention development. © 2019 Hogrefe Publishing.",advertising; advertising literacy; children; coping strategies; intervention,,,,,,,,,"Ajzen, I., The theory of planned behavior (1991) Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes, 50 (2), pp. 179-211; Aronson, E., The power of self-persuasion (1999) American Psychologist, 54 (11), pp. 875-884; Bandura, A., (1997) Self-efficacy: The Exercise of Control, , New York, NY: W.

This study draws on existing research to further consider the role of identification with an ingroup character within a narrative depicting intergroup contact between Muslim and non-Muslim Americans. Results reveal that identification with the non-Muslim (ingroup) model facilitated liking the Muslim (outgroup) model, which reduced prejudice toward Muslims more generally. Identification with the ingroup model also increased conversational self-efficacy and reduced anxiety about future intergroup interactions - both important aspects of improving intergroup relations. © 2019 Hogrefe Publishing GmbH.

Yet the directionality and duration of this effect are unclear. Drawing on the stress generation hypothesis, we postulate that depression increases Facebook surveillance and envy, which may increase depression over time. Using a cross-lagged longitudinal design with two waves spaced 1 year apart, we find that, as expected, depression was associated with more Facebook surveillance and more envy, both initially and 1 year later. However, neither Facebook surveillance nor envy at Time 1 increased depression at Time 2. Instead, depression predicted envy, and envy predicted Facebook surveillance over time. The results show the utility of the stress generation hypothesis in a social media context and have implications for Facebook users' psychological well-being. © 2019 Hogrefe Publishing GmbH.

In the current study, we define such a state as smartphone vigilance, an awareness that one can always get connected to others in combination with a permanent readiness to respond to incoming smartphone notifications. We hypothesized that constantly resisting the urge to interact with their phones draws on response inhibition, and hence interferes with students' ability to inhibit prepotent responses in a concurrent task. To test this, we conducted a preregistered experiment, employing a Bayesian sequential sampling design, where we manipulated smartphone visibility and smartphone notifications during a stopsignal task that measures the ability to inhibit prepotent responses. The task was constructed such that we could disentangle response inhibition from action selection. Results show that the mere visibility of a smartphone is sufficient to experience vigilance and distraction, and that this is enhanced when students receive notifications. Curiously enough, these strong experiences were unrelated to stop-signal task performance. These findings raise new questions about when and how smartphones can impact performance. © 2019 Hogrefe Publishing GmbH.

This paper systematically reviews existing studies of the relationship between culture and media uses/processes/effects and identifies six fields of research: uses and gratifications, social identity, acculturation, diaspora communication, cross- and intercultural communication, and international media markets. The majority of this research is fragmented to the extent that separate approaches and findings of the two pillar disciplines of media psychology (psychology and communication) are not integrated: the social identity and acculturation literature approaches the relationship between culture, media uses/processes/effects from an exclusively psychological angle, using predominantly psychological theories and quantitative methods. Diaspora communication, inter-and cross-cultural communication, and international media markets research is dominated by communication theories and qualitative methods. A theoretical model is presented that integrates concepts of culture into media psychological scholarship on both a supra-individual macro-level (drawing on constructs such as individualism/collectivism, power distance, uncertainty avoidance) and an individual micro-level (drawing on constructs such as social identity, self-construals, values, and beliefs). © 2019 Hogrefe Publishing GmbH.

Consistent with prior studies, the linear association between pornography consumption and satisfaction was negative and significant. However, the addition of a quadratic term to the equation increased model fit. Interaction effect analyses revealed an inverted U relationship for both men and women, such that occasional pornography consumption was associated with higher satisfaction, while consumption with any degree of regularity was associated with lower satisfaction. Further assessments showed that the negative relationship between more regular pornography consumption and lower satisfaction was slightly more marked for women, while the positive relationship between intermittent pornography consumption and higher satisfaction was slightly more marked for men. The nature of the relationship between pornography consumption and satisfaction was similar for religious and nonreligious people and for people in a relationship and not in a relationship. © 2018 Hogrefe Publishing.",curvilinearity; Korea; linearity; pornography; sexual satisfaction,,,,,,,,,"Aiken, L.S., West, S.G., (1991) Multiple Regression, , Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage; Arakawa, D.R., Flanders, C., Hatfield, E., Are variations in gender equality evident in pornography?

The present research aimed to investigate whether this new media context affects the way in which readers process news articles and form their opinions on current debates. In an application of the heuristic-systematic model of persuasion, it was assumed that the high salience of self-presentation and interpersonal contacts in social media triggers an impression-motivated mode of reasoning in which readers base their attitudes more strongly on the majority opinion and social pressures. In a pre-registered laboratory experiment (N = 210) in which participants read a news article, the media context (SNS vs. SNS with anticipation of future interaction vs. online news site) and the valence of the displayed user comments (positive vs. negative) were varied as between-subject factors. It was hypothesized that user comments are more influential when being logged in to Facebook than on classic online news sites, particularly when expecting future opinion expression about the topic and among people with a strong self-monitoring tendency. Results showed significant effects of comment valence on readers' attitudes and valence of thoughts, however, this pattern also occurred in the setting of online news sites and was not moderated by self-monitoring. Findings are discussed with regard to the theoretical predictions of the heuristic-systematic model on following the majority opinion and practical implications for an informed citizenry. © 2019 Hogrefe Publishing GmbH.

In a first content analysis study, the natural occurrence of a set of linguistic biases was analyzed in Italian news articles that described comparable crimes committed by an in- or an outgroup aggressor. Results indicated that when the crime was committed by an outgroup (vs. ingroup) member, more aggravating and less attenuating adjectives were used. Moreover, the nationality of the perpetrator was not only mentioned more frequently, it also appeared in most cases as a noun. In Study 2, participants read a fictitious news article that either described an in- or outgroup criminal act with neutral or biased language. Their implicit associations between in- and outgroup members and weapons (vs. tools) were measured immediately afterward in the weapon paradigm. Results confirmed that a biased (vs. neutral) language use increased participants' crime-related associations with the outgroup in general only when an outgroup criminal was staged.

The present research examines the cross-national measurement validity of these theoretical constructs by testing the factorial structure of the German version of the Appreciation, Fun, and Suspense scales developed by Oliver and Bartsch (2010). Measurement invariance of the scales across US-American (N = 262) and German (N = 274) samples is examined by reanalyzing data sets from two published studies. Findings support the theoretically assumed three-factorial model of the German scale and partial scalar invariance across samples. In addition, exploratory analyses of a third data set (N = 200) revealed that an alternative wording for an item of the Suspense scale may be superior. © 2017 Hogrefe Publishing.",appreciation; enjoyment; eudaimonic and hedonic entertainment experiences; factorial validity; fun; measurement invariance; suspense,,,,,,,,,"Bartsch, A., Emotional gratification in entertainment experience.

We measured the trait level motivational reactivity (ASA and DSA) of 40 participants, who then viewed a series of pictures. Each participant was given the opportunity to select a new picture of either similar or different valence as the picture currently viewed. We recorded indicators of participants' selection behavior: their propensity to change picture valence, ratio of pleasant to unpleasant pictures selected, and decision time (how long it took them to decide on the valence of the next picture). Results showed that motivational activation predicts each of these behavioral indicators, leading to some preliminary implications for online user experience as well as the suggestion that media outlets might consider variance in motivational activation when selecting online content. © 2018 Hogrefe Publishing.",emotion; interactive media; motivation; online behavior,,,,,,,,,"Cacioppo, J.T., Gardner, W.L., Berntson, G.G., Beyond bipolar conceptualizations and measures: The case of attitudes and evaluative space (1997) Personality and Social Psychology Review, 1 (1), pp. 3-25. , https://doi.org/10.1207/s15327957pspr0101_2; Cacioppo, J.T., Gardner, W.L., Berntson, G.G., The affect system has parallel and integrative processing components: Form follows function (1999) Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 76, pp. 839-855. , https://doi.org/10.1037/0022-3514.76.5.839; Cohen, J., (1988) Statistical Power Analysis for the Behavioral Sciences, , Hillsdale, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates; Cohen, J., A power primer (1992) Psychological Bulletin, 112 (1), p. 155; Geir, A., Mucha, R.F., Pauli, P., Appetitive nature of drug cues confirmed with physiological measures in a model using pictures of smoking (2000) Psychopharmacology, 150, pp. 283-291. , https://doi.org/10.1007/s002130000404; Jarvis, B.G., (2008) MediaLab, , (Version 2008.1) [Computer Software].

Negation refers to an internal attempt to negate stereotypic content (""No! This is not true!""). The process of negation is important because a critical assessment of stereotypic content can be beneficial for stereotype and prejudice reduction. This fact is a crucial reason why readers' disagreement regarding simplified stereotypic depictions is of central interest for mass communication research and media literacy campaigns. Importantly, factors that can increase negation are of special interest. Although the ability and motivation to process stereotypic content can be theoretically identified as potential influencing factors, media-stereotype research has not yet tested the influence of these factors on negation. In Experiment 1 (N = 347), we manipulated the motivation to negate by presenting awareness material. We informed some of the participants that the news media often do not represent the world as it is, but sometimes do so in a stereotypic way. Analyses revealed that participants who received the awareness material before reading negated to a higher extent. In Experiment 2 (N = 223), we investigated the impact of ability by manipulating the time participants had to negate stereotypic content. The ability to negate was assumed to be higher the more time the participants had to process stereotypic information. As hypothesized, negation was higher when there was more time available. Interestingly, the increase in effect size was dampened the more time was available, which indicated a curvilinear relationship. Implications for media-literacy campaigns are discussed. © 2017 Hogrefe Publishing.",ability; awareness; media literacy; media stereotypes; motivation; negation,,,,,,,,,"Arendt, F., Cultivation effects of a newspaper on reality estimates and explicit and implicit attitudes (2010) Journal of Media Psychology, 22, pp. 147-159; Arendt, F., Dose-dependent media priming effects of stereotypic newspaper articles on implicit and explicit stereotypes (2013) Journal of Communication, 63, pp. 830-851; Arendt, F., Marquart, F., Matthes, J., Effects of right-wing populist political advertising on implicit and explicit stereotypes (2015) Journal of Media Psychology, 27, pp. 178-189; Chartrand, T., Bargh, J., Automatic activation of impression formation and memorization goals: Nonconscious goal priming reproduces effects of explicit task instructions (1996) Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 71, pp. 464-478; Dixon, T.L., He was a Black guy: How news' misrepresentation of crime creates fear of Blacks (2009) Race/gender/media: Considering Diversity Across Audiences, Content, and Producers, pp. 24-29. , R.

These characteristics can have negative effects on the perceived quality of the commented-on journalistic content, yet to date, it remains unclear how such effects occur. We propose three mechanisms that assume that the effect of user comments depends on how deliberately and elaborately the quality of the commented-on news item is judged. We conducted an experiment (N = 633) in which we varied the level of civility and reasoning in the comments accompanying a news article and the brand of the news website on which it was presented. The results showed that a lack of reasoning in the comments decreased the perceived quality of the news item irrespective of brand awareness, but only with high elaboration during judgment. Incivility in the comments decreased the perceived quality of the journalistic content, but only with low elaboration, and only with an unknown news brand. We discuss different psychological mechanisms that can explain this pattern of effects. © 2017 Hogrefe Publishing.",civility; judgment; online news; user comments; user-generated content,,,,,,,,,"Ash, E., Peeling, A., Hettinga, K., Does content matter? the effects of type and number of user-generated comments on news stories (2010) Association for Education in Journalism & Mass Communication National Conference, Denver, CO, , (August); Chen, S., Chaiken, S., The heuristic-systematic model in its broader context (1999) Dual-process Theories in Social Psychology, pp. 73-96. , S.

Playing with teammate avatars increased enjoyment indirectly by enhancing group identification. In addition, the presence of social identity cues increased enjoyment indirectly by augmenting identification with one's avatar. Unexpectedly, playing in multiplayer mode in the presence of social identity cues decreased enjoyment, whereas playing in multiplayer mode in the absence of social identity cues increased enjoyment.

While prior research indicates that considering alternative perspectives facilitates understanding, little is known about how media-enhanced perspectives affect learning processes for higher-order concepts that require synthesis of ideas and making inferences such as reasoning about problems in science. Two experiments used digital video of a science instructional event to investigate features of visual perspective on engagement and knowledge construction. Study 1 showed that an embodied first-person viewpoint achieved using a head-mounted camera better supported learning than a traditional third-person view of the same event. In Study 2, applying a motion algorithm to both a first-person and third-person video allowed us to isolate the effects of viewpoint and camera motion. While the addition of artificial motion benefited learning for third-person viewers, only motion that is aligned with the actor's actions and affect enhances first-person viewing. Findings are considered in terms of how certain media position learners in relation to educational content. Specifically, we argue that media features such as viewpoint and motion can be configured in ways to create ""fields of potential action"" that engage viewers and optimize conditions for learning. © 2018 Hogrefe Publishing.",digital media; learning; perspective; social cognition; video,,,,,,"National Science Foundation, NSF

First, we tested Hartmann's (2011, 2012) notion that video games are processed via two separate cognitive systems: System 1, the automatic system, and System 2, the rational system. Specifically, we used a cognitive load manipulation to test if intuitive moral responses such as guilt and anthropomorphism are processed in System 1. Second, we utilized moral foundations theory to test the effect of care salience on guilt and in-game aggression. Using an experimental design (n = 94), the results indicate that under conditions of cognitive load, players had somewhat lower in-game aggression. Effects on guilt and anthropomorphism were in the same direction, albeit with small effects. In terms of moral foundations, we found that care salience was not negatively related to in-game aggression but was directly related to guilt, indicating that greater emphasis on the moral foundation of care resulted in greater guilt. Also, anthropomorphism was positively related to experienced guilt and negatively related to in-game aggression. © 2017 Hogrefe Publishing.",cognitive load; moral reasoning; rational vs. intuitive processing; video game play,,,,,,,,,"Bowman, N.D., Video gaming as co-production (2016) Producing 2.0: The Intersection of Audiences and Production in A Digital World, 2, pp. 107-123. , R.

Responding to this limitation, the present study investigated longitudinal causality associations among loneliness, problematic use of smartphones, face-to-face interaction, smartphone-mediated communication, and need for social assurance with cross-lagged panel models. The results suggest that loneliness leads to problematic use of smartphones, which reduces face-to-face interaction while increasing need for social assurance. However, need for social assurance fueled by excessive smartphone use is usually not gratified, and eventually leads to greater loneliness. © 2017 Hogrefe Publishing.",cross-lagged panel model; face-to-face interaction; loneliness; need for social assurance; problematic use of smartphone; smartphone-mediated communication,,,,,,,,,"Allport, G.W., Odbert, H.S., Trait-names: A psycho-lexical study (1936) Psychological Monographs, 47, p. 211; (2013) Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, , American Psychiatric Association.

The current research delves into the nuances of value framing effects and helps explain processes such as applicability. Two web-based experiments were conducted using value frames related to two different issues, civil liberties and gay rights. Findings from moderated-mediation models indicate that when individuals are exposed to competitive frames they feel ambivalent. Because of this ambivalence, participants were more willing to seek information and showed increased online information-seeking behavior. However, these findings are true only in cases of individuals who are motivated to process the information. Implications are discussed. © 2018 Hogrefe Publishing.",accuracy motivations; ambivalence; competitive framing; psychological mechanisms; value framing effects,,,,,,,,,"Borah, P., Seeking more information and conversations: Influence of competitive frames and motivated processing (2011) Communication Research, 38 (3), pp. 303-325. , https://doi.org/10.1177/0093650210376190; Borah, P., Conceptual issues in framing: A systematic examination of a decade's literature (2011) Journal of Communication, 61 (2), pp. 246-263. , https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1460-2466.2011.01539.x; Borah, P., Does it matter where you read the news stories?

Through an experiment, we tested the hypothesis that identification with the main character in Grand Theft Auto IV mediates the effect of interactivity on attributions of responsibility for the main character's antisocial behavior. Using the framework of the fundamental attribution error, we demonstrated that those who actually played the game, as opposed to those who simply watched someone else playing it, identified with the main character. In accordance with the theoretical expectation, those who played the game and came to identify with the main character attributed the responsibility for his actions to external factors such as ""living in a violent society."" By contrast, those who did not interact with the game attributed responsibility for the character's actions to his personality traits. These findings could be viewed as contrasting with psychological research suggesting that respondents should have distanced themselves from the violent protagonist rather than identifying with him, and with Iyengar's (1991) expectation that more personalized episodic framing would be associated with attributing responsibility to the protagonist. © 2016 Hogrefe Publishing.",FAE; human-computer interaction; identification; interactivity; video games,,,,,,"Israel Science Foundation, ISF","Yariv Tsfati (PhD, 2001, University of Pennsylvania) is Associate Professor and Chair at the Department of Communication, University of Haifa.

This study aims to build off of this work by proposing that perception of intergroup conflict serves as a mechanism that mediates the effect of news media coverage on political polarization. Specifically, I argue that the news media's emphasis on political animosity can cultivate partisans' perception that the parties are in conflict, which provides a context that makes partisan identity salient and, ultimately, leads to higher levels of affective and ideological polarization. This hypothesis is tested with an experiment using an American national sample of Democrats and Republicans (N = 300). Participants read a news story in which the public believes the parties are in a state of either high or low conflict (or they did not receive a news story). Using mediation analysis, the results of the study provide evidence that news media coverage of political conflict leads to increased perception of intergroup conflict, which then leads to higher levels of (a) partisan identification, (b) affective polarization, and (c) ideological polarization. © 2016 Hogrefe Publishing.",impersonal influence; political conflict; political polarization; social identity theory,,,,,,,,,"Abramowitz, A., (2011) The Disappearing Center: Engaged Citizens Polarization, and American Democracy, , New Haven, CT: Yale University Press; Abrams, D., Wetherell, M., Cochrane, S., Hogg, M.A., Turner, J.C., Knowing what to think by knowing who you are: Self-categorization and the nature of norm formation, conformity and group polarization (1990) British Journal of Social Psychology, 29, pp. 97-119; Bass, F., Party conflicts in D.C outstrip all other U.S conflicts (2013) Bloomberg News, , http://www.businessweek.com/news/2013-01-10/party-conflicts-in-d-dot-c-dot-outstrip-all-other-u-dot-s-dot-conflicts, (January); Brewer, M.B., In-group bias in the minimal intergroup situation: A cognitive-motivational analysis (1979) Psychological Bulletin, 86, pp. 307-324; Brewer, M., Ingrouidentification and intergrouconflict: When does ingroulove become outgrouhate?

The current paper presents results from a study designed to test the MIME's predictions, measuring the accessibility of moral intuitions with a moral foundations-affect misattribution procedure (MF-AMP) argued in the current paper to be more capable of detecting the aforementioned effect. An experiment manipulated exposure to media content that focused on care and fairness to test the proposition that media content can increase the accessibility of these moral intuitions. The findings offer preliminary evidence supporting the MIME's proposition that media content featuring behaviors relevant to specific moral intuitions can increase (temporarily at least) the accessibility of those specific moral intuitions in the audiences. © 2016 Hogrefe Publishing.",AMP; entertainment; MIME; moral intuition; morality,,,,,,,,,"(2009) About ACLU, , https://www.aclu.org/about-aclu-0, ACLU.., n.d.

On the basis of this notion, we hypothesized that when people read international news articles favoring their own country over another, they would afterwards evaluate their country (in-group) better than the other country (out-group) - a tendency referred to as positive distinctiveness in social identity theory (SIT). We further hypothesized that when people read international news articles favoring their own country, they would afterwards have better knowledge of the news articles they read. An experiment with two groups (positive vs. negative articles in terms of participants' own national identity) was conducted in Germany and the US (total N = 364). We found that when participants read positively valenced news articles, they afterwards showed more positive distinctiveness (e.g., U.S. students believed that the US had a better national educational system than Germany). We also found that when German participants read positively valenced news articles, they demonstrated better knowledge of the articles. This effect was not found in the U.S. sample. Overall, we found support for the notion that social identity mechanisms are relevant when it comes to analyzing the effects of news media. © 2016 Hogrefe Publishing.",national identity; news knowledge; news reading; positive distinctiveness; social identity theory (SIT),,,,,,,,,"Abrams, D., Hogg, M.A., Comments on the motivational status of self-esteem in social identity and intergroup discrimination (1988) European Journal of Social Psychology, 18, pp. 317-334; (1990) Social Identity Theory: Constructive and Critical Advances, , Abrams D. & Hogg M.

Integrating exemplification theory with risk communication research, the effect of using virtual simulations to exemplify the health risks of soft drink consumption was assessed across 3 weeks. A three-group pretest, posttest, and delayed posttest design (N = 62) compared the effect of three channels of delivering health risk information - base-rate statistics, picture, and virtual simulation - embedded in a digital health promotion pamphlet. Three dimensions of risk perception (perceived likelihood, susceptibility, severity), involvement with the health issue, and soft drink consumption were measured across 3 weeks. Virtual exemplars were the most effective channel for increasing perceived likelihood, perceived susceptibility, involvement, and soft drink consumption over time. Exemplification did not affect perceived severity. The paper discusses the potential of virtual exemplars as a powerful tool in designing effective health messages. © 2016 Hogrefe Publishing.",exemplification theory; health promotion campaigns; obesity; risk perception; soft drinks; virtual simulations,,,,,,,,,"Ahn, S.J., Incorporating immersive virtual environments in health promotion campaigns: A construal-level theory approach (2015) Health Communication, 30, pp. 545-556; Ahn, S.J., Bailenson, J.N., Park, D., Short- and long-term effects of embodied experiences in immersive virtual environments on environmental locus of control and behavior (2014) Computers in Human Behavior, 39, pp. 235-245; Ahn, S.J., Fox, J., Hahm, J., Using virtual doppelgängers to increase personal relevance of health risk communication (2014) Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 8637, pp. 1-12; Ahn, S.J., Johnsen, K., Moore, J., Brown, S., Biersmith, M., Ball, C., Using virtual pets to increase fruit and vegetable consumption in children: A technology-assisted social cognitive theory approach (2016) Cyberpsychology, Behavior, and Social Networking, 19, pp. 86-92; Ahn, S.J., Johnsen, K., Robertson, T., Moore, J., Brown, S., Marable, A., Basu, A., Using virtual pets to promote physical activity in children: An application of the youth physical activity promotion model (2015) Journal of Health Communication, 20, pp. 807-815; Armor, D.A., Taylor, S.E., Situated optimism: Specific outcome expectancies and self-regulation (1998) Advances in Experimental Social Psychology, 30, pp. 309-379; Baker, C.W., Little, T.D., Brownell, K.D., Predicting adolescent eating and activity behaviors: The role of social norms and personal agency (2003) Health Psychology, 22, pp. 189-198; Bar-Hillel, M., The base-rate fallacy in probability judgments (1980) Acta Psychologica, 44, pp. 211-233; Bente, G., Krämer, N.C., Petersen, A., De Ruiter, J.P., Computer animated movement and person perception: Methodological advances in nonverbal behavior research (2001) Journal of Nonverbal Behavior, 25, pp. 151-166; Brewer, N.T., Chapman, G.B., Gibbons, F.X., Gerrard, M., McCaul, K.D., Weinstein, N.D., Meta-analysis of the relationship between risk perception and health behavior: The example of vaccination (2007) Health Psychology, 26, pp. 136-145; Childers, T.L., Houston, M.J., Conditions for a picture-superiority effect on consumer memory (1984) Journal of Consumer Research, 11, pp. 643-654; Cohn, L.D., Marcfarlane, S., Yanez, C., Imai, W.K., Risk-perception: Differences between adolescents and adults (1995) Health Psychology, 14 (3), pp. 217-222; Delo, C., Virtual reality: Advertising's next big thing?

Shot scale, referring to the relative size of the figure on the screen, effectively regulates theory of mind relevant visual cues carried by faces. However, research into the effect of shot scale on theory of mind responses in a narrative is almost nonexistent. The aim of the present study was to investigate the extent to which shot scale influences theory of mind responding in film viewers. Four short animated movies were annotated for average shot scale and presented in a within-subject design. Employing mixed-method data collection, participants were asked to retell the story of the films and fill in questionnaires on narrative experience. Skin conductance was also measured during exposure. Story descriptions were content analyzed for theory of mind responses. In a Poisson regression model, average shot scale predicted theory of mind response indicating that increasing spatial proximity to the character triggered higher occurrence of mental state references in participants' story descriptions. The findings elucidate how formal properties of character presentation affect an audience's mental models of a story. © 2016 Hogrefe Publishing.",character engagement; shot scale; spatial distance; theory of mind; visual narratives,,,,,,,,,"Adams, R.B., Rule, N.O., Franklin, R.G., Wang, E., Stevenson, M.T., Yoshikawa, S., Ambady, N., Cross-cultural reading the mind in the eyes: An fMRI investigation (2010) Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience, 22, pp. 97-108; Agresti, A., (2003) Categorical Data Analysis, , Hoboken, NJ: Wiley; Balazs, B., Carter, E., (2013) Bela Balazs: Early Film Theory: Visible Man and the Spirit of Film, , New York, NY: Berghahn Books; Bálint, K., Nagy, T., Csabai, M., The effect of patient-centeredness and gender of professional role models on trainees' mentalization responses.

One approach to narratives emphasizes a deictic shift into the narrative, resulting in an absorbed state of processing and a loss of one's sense of self (e.g., transportation, narrative engagement, identification). Another approach focuses on processes to construct meaning from a narrative; that is, how narratives are actively compared with and applied to one's life. The current work has conceptualized the relationship between these two broad processes as occurring in sequence, and as a pathway of narrative persuasion: A shift and absorption into the narrative leads to a process of reflecting on the narrative, which is antecedent to narrative influence. © 2016 Hogrefe Publishing.",deictic shift; narrative; narrative engagement; persuasion; transportation,,,,,,,,,"Appel, M., Richter, T., Persuasive effects of fictional narratives increase over time (2007) Media Psychology, 10 (1), pp. 113-134; Bahl, S., Milne, G.R., Talking to ourselves: A dialogical exploration of consumption experiences (2010) Journal of Consumer Research, 37 (1), pp. 176-195; Banerjee, S.C., Greene, K., Examining narrative transportation to anti-alcohol narratives (2013) Journal of Substance Use, 18 (3), pp. 196-210; Baumeister, R.F., Bratslavsky, E., Finkenauer, C., Vohs, K.D., Bad is stronger than good (2001) Review of General Psychology, 5 (4), pp. 323-370; Bilandzic, H., Busselle, R.W., Enjoyment of films as a function of narrative experience, perceived realism and transportability (2011) Communications, 36 (1), pp. 29-50; Braverman, J., Testimonials versus informational persuasive messages (2008) Communication Research, 35 (5), pp. 666-694; Bruner, J.S., (1986) Actual Minds, Possible Worlds, , Harvard University Press; Burnkrant, R.E., Unnava, H.R., Self-Referencing A Strategy for Increasing Processing of Message Content (1989) Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, 15 (4), pp. 628-638; Busselle, R., Bilandzic, H., Fictionality and perceived realism in experiencing stories: A model of narrative comprehension and engagement (2008) Communication Theory, 18 (2), pp. 255-280; Busselle, R., Bilandzic, H., Measuring narrative engagement (2009) Media Psychology, 12 (4), pp. 321-347; Cacioppo, J.T., Petty, R.E., The need for cognition (1982) Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 42 (1), pp. 116-131; Caputo, N.M., Rouner, D., Narrative processing of entertainment media and mental illness stigma (2011) Health Communication, 26 (7), pp. 595-604; Chung, A.H., Slater, M.D., Reducing stigma and out-group distinctions through perspective-taking in narratives (2013) Journal of Communication, 63 (5), pp. 894-911; Cohen, J., Defining identification: A theoretical look at the identification of audiences with media characters (2001) Mass Communication & Society, 4 (3), pp. 245-264; Cohen, J.B., Andrade, E.B., Affective intuition and task-contingent affect regulation (2004) Journal of Consumer Research, 31 (2), pp. 358-367; Csikszentmihalyi, M., (1996) Creativity: Flow and the Psychology of Discovery and Invention, , New York, NY: HarperCollins; Dal Cin, S., Zanna, M.P., Fong, G.T., Narrative persuasion and overcoming resistance (2004) Resistance and Persuasion, pp. 175-191. , E.

Murrow College of Communication, Washington State University, Washington, DC, United States","In an effort to quantify message complexity in such a way that predictions regarding the moment-to-moment cognitive and emotional processing of viewers would be made, Lang and her colleagues devised the coding system information introduced (or ii). This coding system quantifies the number of structural features that are known to consume cognitive resources and considers it in combination with the number of camera changes (cc) in the video, which supply additional cognitive resources owing to their elicitation of an orienting response. This study further validates ii using psychophysiological responses that index cognitive resource allocation and recognition memory. We also pose two novel hypotheses regarding the confluence of controlled and automatic processing and the effect of cognitive overload on enjoyment of messages. Thirty television advertisements were selected from a pool of 172 (all 20 s in length) based on their ii/cc ratio and ratings for their arousing content. Heart rate change over time showed significant deceleration (indicative of increased cognitive resource allocation) for messages with greater ii/cc ratios. Further, recognition memory worsened as ii/cc increased. It was also found that message complexity increases both automatic and controlled allocations to processing, and that the most complex messages may have created a state of cognitive overload, which was received as enjoyable by the participants in this television context. © 2017 Hogrefe Publishing.",enjoyment; information introduced; psychophysiology,,,,,,,"This study has been supported by a grant from the Foundation for Broadcasting Culture (http://www.fbc.or. kr/), Seoul, Korea.",,"Ang, C.S., Zaphiris, P., Mahmood, S., A model of cognitive loads in massively multiplayer online role playing games (2007) Interacting with Computers, 19 (2), pp. 167-179; Bolls, P.D., Lang, A., Potter, R.F., The effects of message valence and listener arousal on attention, memory, and facial muscular responses to radio advertisements (2001) Communication Research, 28, pp. 627-651; Fox, J.R., Park, B., Lang, A., When available resources become negative resources: The effects of cognitive overload on memory sensitivity and criterion bias (2007) Communication Research, 34 (3), pp. 277-296; Geiger, S., Reeves, B., The effects of scene changes and semantic relatedness on attention to television (1993) Communication Research, 20 (2), pp. 155-175; Hartley, R.V., Transmission of information (1928) Bell System Technical Journal, 7 (3), pp. 535-563; Hinds, P.J., The cognitive and interpersonal costs of video (1999) Media Psychology, 1 (4), pp. 283-311; Huff, M., Meitz, T.G.K., Papenmeier, F., Changes in situation models modulate processes of event perception in audiovisual narratives (2014) Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory and Cognition, 40 (5), pp. 1377-1388; Kida, T., Smith, J.F., The encoding and retrieval of numerical data for decision making in accounting contexts: Model development (1995) Accounting, Organizations and Society, 20 (7), pp. 585-610; Lachman, R., Lachman, J.L., Butterfield, E.C., (1979) Cognitive Psychology and Information Processing: An Introduction, , Hillsdale, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates; Lang, A., What can the heart tell us about thinking?

Previous theoretical work yielded contrasting assumptions about a potential link between individuals' Internet use and their self-concept clarity, that is, individuals' perception of a clear and internally consistent self-concept content. Focusing on social networking sites, our aim was to provide cross-sectional as well as longitudinal evidence regarding the relationship between individuals' feelings of connectedness to Facebook (Facebook intensity) and self-concept clarity. Two cross-sectional studies (N1 = 244; N2 = 166) and one longitudinal study (N3 = 101) are presented. Independent samples of adolescents, adults, and students from Austria participated. The statistical procedures included hierarchical regression analyses (Studies 1 and 2) and a cross-lagged panel analysis (Study 3). The studies provided consistent evidence of a negative relationship between Facebook intensity and self-concept clarity. Moreover, the longitudinal study showed that Facebook intensity predicted a decline in self-concept clarity over time whereas a reverse pathway was not supported. Future research should examine the content of the self-concept and should continue searching for specific Facebook activities that might explain the decline in self-concept clarity. Our results suggest that an intense attachment to Facebook contributes to an inconsistent and unclear self-concept. © 2016 Hogrefe Publishing.",cross-lagged panel analysis; Facebook; fragmentation hypothesis; self-concept clarity; unity hypothesis,,,,,,,,,"Ahmad, I., (2014) What Happens in Just ONE Minute on Facebook [Web Log Message], , http://www.digitalinformationworld.com/2014/06/what-happens-in-a-facebook-minute-infographic.html, (, June 11)., Retrieved from; Appel, M., Mara, M., Weber, S., (2014) Media and Social Life, pp. 16-28. , Media and identity.

This study examined the effects of two health message features, suggested susceptibility and gain-loss framing, on respondents' selective exposure and subsequent health behavior intentions. Two personality traits, repression-sensitization and approach/avoidance motivation, were studied as moderators of the proposed relationships. An experimental 2 (suggested susceptibility: low vs. high) × 2 (gain-loss framing: gain- vs. loss-framed message) study was conducted. Participants browsed through an online health magazine while their message choices were unobtrusively logged. A subsequent online questionnaire assessed personality dispositions and behavioral intentions. High levels of message susceptibility increased both selective exposure to health messages and respondents' motivation to engage in adaptive health behaviors. Gain-loss framing did not affect message exposure or behavioral intentions, with one exception: Avoidance-oriented low-anxious respondents selected more loss-framed than gain-framed articles for reading. Repression-sensitization and approach/avoidance motivation did not moderate health message effects, but partly influenced these measures directly or in combination. The number of articles to choose from was limited, and it is unclear to what extent the findings can be generalized to other, more familiar health topics. Emphasizing readers' susceptibility to health threats appears very effective for increasing exposure to health messages and protective behavioral intentions. The effectiveness of gain-loss framing, by contrast, largely depends on moderating factors. © 2017 Hogrefe Publishing.",approach/avoidance motivation; gainloss framing; message susceptibility; repression-sensitization; selective exposure,,,,,,,,,"Armstrong, J.S., (2010) Persuasive Advertising: Evidence-based Principles, , New York, NY: Palgrave Macmillan; Barbour, J.B., Rintamaki, L.S., Ramsey, J.A., Brashers, D.E., Avoiding health information (2011) Journal of Health Communication, 17, pp. 212-229; Baumeister, R.F., Bratslavsky, E., Finkenauer, C., Vohs, K.D., Bad is stronger than good (2001) Review of General Psychology, 5, pp. 323-370; Berry, D.C., (2004) Risk, Communication and Health Psychology, , Berkshire, UK: Open University Press; Brehm, J.W., (1966) A Theory of Psychological Reactance, , New York, NY: Academic Press; Brewer, N.T., Chapman, G.B., Gibbons, F.X., Gerrard, M., McCaul, K.D., Weinstein, N.D., Meta-analysis of the relationship between risk perception and health behavior: The example of vaccination (2007) Health Psychology, 26, pp. 136-145; Byrne, D., Repression-sensitization as a dimension of personality (1964) Progress in Experimental Personality Research, pp. 170-215. , B.

Perceptual disconfirmation occurs when individuals have a negative expectation regarding their future conversation partners' demeanor, but after conversing with and influencing their partners' behavior, individuals' assessment of their partners' demeanor becomes more positive. This effect is, so far, novel to computer-mediated communication: When individuals with similar expectancies get acquainted using phone or face-to-face channels their negative preinteraction expectancies persist and assessments remain unchanged. This experiment explored the extent to which questions and disclosures, and partners' disclosive responses, mediated perceptual disconfirmation. Individuals were led to believe that a dyadic conversation partner was either in a bad mood (negative and malleable expectation) or had a bad personality (negative and nonmalleable expectation). After a 30-min online conversation to get acquainted, perceptual disconfirmation emerged, although the verbal strategies did not mediate the effect. This study raises new questions about the process by which individuals who have negative expectancies of their future conversation partners defy these negative expectations and shift their attitudes to become more positive online. © 2016 Hogrefe Publishing.",computer-mediated communication; perceptual disconfirmation; self-disclosure; uncertainty reduction,,,,,,,,,"Altman, I., Taylor, D., (1973) Social Penetration: The Development of Interpersonal Relationships, , New York, NY: Holt, Rinehart, & Winston; Antheunis, M.L., Valkenburg, P.M., Peter, J., Getting acquainted through social network sites: Testing a model of online uncertainty reduction and social attraction (2010) Computers in Human Behavior, 26, pp. 100-109; Barak, A., Gluck-Ofri, O., Degree and reciprocity of self-disclosure in online forums (2007) Cyber Psychology & Behavior, 10, pp. 407-417; Berger, C.R., Beyond initial interaction: Uncertainty, understanding, and the development of interpersonal relationships (1979) Language and Social Psychology, pp. 122-144. , H.

The current study evaluates whether the effect of media schemas depends on more specific audience schemas. Participants read vignettes of four ""actors"" in a 2 (gullible vs. critical-minded) × 2 (heavy vs. light Internet users) repeated measures experiment and rated how much the actors can resist the influence of media and how much they benefit from censorship. For comparison, participants rated themselves on the same dependent variables. Results show that gullible heavy Internet users are perceived to have the greatest self-regulatory inefficacy and benefit the most from censorship, while the opposite outcome is true for critical-minded light Internet users. These patterns remain when evaluating self-other asymmetric efficacy beliefs, which I discuss in relation to motivational and cognitive processes underlying the third-person effect. © 2016 Hogrefe Publishing.",censorship; efficacy; gullibility; Internet use; third-person effect,,,,,,M4081450,A grant from the Wee Kim Wee School of Communication and Information (M4081450) supported this research.,,"Andsager, J.L., White, H.A., (2007) Self Versus Others: Media, Messages, and the Third-person Effect, , Hoboken, NJ: Taylor & Francis; Augoustinos, M., Walker, I., (1995) Social Cognition: An Integrated Introduction, , London, UK: Sage; Bandura, A., Self-efficacy: Toward a unifying theory of behavioral change (1977) Psychological Review, 84, pp. 191-215; Bandura, A., Self-efficacy mechanism in human agency (1982) American Psychologist, 37, pp. 122-147; Bandura, A., Social cognitive theory of self-regulation (1991) Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes, 50, pp. 248-287; Bartlett, F., (1932) Remembering: A Study in Experimental and Social Psychology, , (/1972)., London, UK: Cambridge University Press; Brewer, W.F., Schemas versus mental models in human memory (1987) Modeling Cognition, pp. 187-197. , P.

A total of 40 usable research articles were identified and used in this meta-analysis. With some articles having multiple effect sizes, a total of 150 effect sizes for gender difference in CV were obtained. Results indicated a small gender difference, with females experiencing slightly more CV than their male counterparts. However, there were considerable inconsistencies across the studies. Follow-up analyses on the study features revealed that several factors, such as response time frame and region of sampling, significantly moderated the relationship between gender and CV. Exploratory in nature, this study discusses the implications of the findings in reference to existing theories, and suggests future research directions. © 2016 Hogrefe Publishing.",cyber-victimization; cyberbully; gender; meta-analysis,,,,,,,,,"Abeele, M.V., Cock, R., Cyberbullying by mobile phone among adolescents: The role of gender and peer group status (2013) Communications, 38, pp. 107-118; Ackers, M.J., Cyberbullying: Through the eyes of children and young people (2012) Educational Psychology in Practice, 28, pp. 141-157; Aricak, T., Siyahhan, S., Uzunhasanoglu, A., Saribeyoglu, S., Ciplak, S., Yilmaz, N., Memmedov, C., Cyberbullying among Turkish adolescents (2008) CyberPsychology & Behavior, 11, pp. 253-261; Barlett, C.P., Gentile, D.A., Attacking others online: The formation of cyberbullying in late adolescence (2012) Psychology of Popular Media Culture, 1, pp. 123-135; Beckman, L., Hagquist, C., Hellström, L., Does the association with psychosomatic health problems differ between cyberbullying and traditional bullying?

It examines memory for the commercials activated by sexual versus nonsexual visual appeals. A mixed-factorial experiment was conducted. Visual recognition and free recall were recorded in 146 participants (males = 71 and females = 75). The results substantiate the evolutionary psychology claims. Support for the motivational information-processing and the distraction hypothesis was found in male viewers. The results indicate that sexual appeals enhance memory for the advertisements themselves, but they distract men from processing brand-related information. Male participants encoded and recalled less brand-related information from advertisements with sexual appeals. The study offers guidelines for advertisers and marketing producers while also providing insight into gender/sex differences in processing sexual stimuli. It also makes a key theoretical contribution to the field by parsing out the influence of sexual versus nonsexual visual content from the confounding impact of visual sexual versus verbal nonsexual memory. © 2016 Hogrefe Publishing.",evolutionary psychology; gender/sex; memory; motivational information-processing; visual sexual appeals,,,,,,,,,"Azzalini, A., Dalla Valle, A., The multivariate skew-normal distribution (1996) Biometrika, 83 (4), pp. 715-726; Baars, B.J., Gage, N.M., (2007) Cognition, Brain, and Consciousness: Introduction to Cognitive Neuroscience, , London, UK: Elsevier; Bagozzi, R.P., Silk, A.J., Recall, recognition, and the measurement of memory for print advertisements (1983) Marketing Science, 2 (2), pp. 95-134; Bastin, C., Van Der Linden, M., Schnakers, C., Montaldi, D., Mayes, A.R., The contribution of familiarity to within- and between-domain associative recognition memory: Use of a modified remember/know procedure (2010) European Journal of Cognitive Psychology, 22 (6), pp. 922-943; Bower, G.H., Mood and memory (1981) American Psychologist, 36, pp. 129-148; Box, G.E., Non-normality and tests on variances (1953) Biometrika, 40 (3-4), pp. 318-335; Bradley, M.M., Codispoti, M., Cuthbert, B.N., Lang, P.J., Emotion and motivation I: Defensive and appetitive reactions in processing (2001) Emotion, 1 (3), pp. 276-298; Bradley, M.M., Codispoti, M., Sabatinelli, D., Lang, P.J., Emotion and motivation II: Sex differences in picture processing (2001) Emotion, 1 (3), pp. 300-319; Broadbent, D.E., (1958) Perception and Communication, , New York, NY: Oxford University Press; Buss, D.M., Sex differences in human mate preferences: Evolutionary hypotheses tested in 37 cultures (1989) Behavioral and Brain Sciences, 12, pp. 1-49; Cacioppo, J.T., Berntson, G.G., The affect system: Architecture and operating characteristics (1999) Current Directions in Psychological Science, 8 (5), pp. 133-137; Cacioppo, J.T., Gardner, W.L., Emotion (1999) Annual Review of Psychology, 50, pp. 191-214; Carsky, M.L., Zuckerman, M.E., Search of gender differences in marketing communication: An historical/contemporary analysis (1991) Proceedings of the Conference on Gender and Consumer Behavior, pp. 124-138. , Association for Consumer Research.

The current cross-sectional study (N = 3,133) aims to explore the relation between being exposed to and displaying alcohol-related content on SNS with alcohol abuse among adolescents aged 16-20 years. First, the results support that displaying alcohol-related content on SNS is more strongly associated with alcohol abuse than exposure to this kind of content. Furthermore, the associations of both exposure to and displaying alcohol-related content on SNS with alcohol abuse are mediated through perceived social norms of friends and attitudes toward excessive alcohol consumption. Yet, whereas alcohol-related attitudes and social norms seemed to be equally important mediators in the relation between exposure to alcohol-related content on SNS and alcohol abuse, the association between displaying alcohol-related content on SNS and alcohol abuse seemed to be mediated predominantly through a change in alcohol-related attitudes. Overall, this study sheds more light on the complex relations between SNS use and risky drinking behavior among adolescents. © 2016 Hogrefe Publishing.",adolescents; alcohol; attitudes; social networking sites; social norms,,,,,,"Fonds Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek, FWO

Among the neglected issues in this area of research is the question of whether excessive gaming reflects a transient phenomenon during adolescence or a temporally stable pathological behavior that requires external intervention. In a correlational panel study with two points of measurement, we investigated the temporal stability of excessive gaming in German adolescents (N = 488; aged 12-17 years at Time 1) over a time lag of 1 year. Among the video game players in our sample, 2.8% were classified as excessive gamers at both points of measurement. The correlation of excessive gaming between T1 and T2 was found to be relatively moderate (r =.54). Detailed inspection revealed even lower stability scores for each single component of excessive gaming such as tolerance or conflict, with the most problematic elements (stealing, borrowing money because of gaming problems) displaying the lowest stabilities (r <.30). Thus, the results indicate that - at least for the large majority of adolescent players - excessive gaming is a transient and not a stable condition.

This study investigates the ability of a 30-minute digital game as compared with a 30-minute video to teach people how to recognize and mitigate three cognitive biases: fundamental attribution error, confirmation bias, and bias blind spot. We investigate the effects of character customization on learning outcomes as compared with an assigned character. We use interviews to understand the qualitative differences between the conditions. Experimental results suggest that the game was more effective at teaching and mitigating cognitive biases than was the training video. Although interviews suggest players liked avatar customization, results of the experiment indicate that avatar customization had no significant effect on learning outcomes. This research provides information future designers can use to choose the best medium and affordances for the most effective learning outcomes on cognitive processes. © 2016 Hogrefe Publishing.",character customization; cognitive biases; digital games; educational games; game characteristics,,,,,,"Air Force Research Laboratory, AFRL: FA8650-11-C-7176

Acknowledging the rapid growth of exergames, scholars have investigated exergame play experiences with a focus on the feedback a player receives about performance (e.g., progress bar, score) and how this information can influence game play experiences. To extend the existing exergame research, this study has two primary goals: (a) to test how the supportiveness of verbal feedback messages from an exergame can influence players' exergame experiences and (b) to evaluate the way that a player's sense of social presence may serve as a mechanism for understanding the link between feedback and experiences. An experiment (N = 47) was conducted using a between-subjects design. Two groups were compared: highly supportive versus lowly supportive feedback condition. The findings reveal that players who receive highly supportive feedback report greater exergame experience (e.g., enjoyment) than players who receive lowly supportive feedback. Further, social presence is a key variable that mediates the relationship between feedback and exergame experiences. Although the current research findings are important, they are limited to explaining short-term, immediate responses after exergame play among college students. The current research provides implications for research and practice. In particular, the study contributes to an extended understanding of feedback in exergame research and social presence research. At a practical level, the findings suggest that exergame designers should consider incorporating more supportive social feedback messages into a game. © 2016 Hogrefe Publishing.",Exergame; feedback; mediation effect; presence; social presence,,,,,,,,,"Anderson, E.S., Wojcik, J.R., Winett, R.A., Williams, D.M., Social-cognitive determinants of physical activity: The influence of social support, self-efficacy, outcome expectations, and self-regulation among participants in a church-based health promotion study (2006) Health Psychology, 25, pp. 510-520; Bandura, A., (1986) Social Foundations of Thought and Action, , Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice-Hall; Bandura, A., (1997) Self-efficacy: The Exercise of Control, , New York, NY: Freeman; Bandura, A., Social cognitive theory of mass communication (2001) Media Psychology, 3, pp. 265-299; Bindarwish, J., Tenenbaum, G., Metamotivational and contextual effects on performance, self-efficacy, and shifts in affective states (2006) Psychology of Sport and Exercise, 7, pp. 41-56; Biocca, F., The cyborg's dilemma: Progressive embodiment in virtual environments (1997) Journal of Computer Mediated-Communication, 3 (2). , http://jcmc.indiana.edu/vo/issue2/biocca2.html; Biocca, F., Harms, C., Burgoon, J., Toward a more robust theory and measure of social presence: Review and suggested criteria (2003) Presence, 12, pp. 456-480; Bracken, C.C., Lombard, M., Social presence and children: Praise, intrinsic motivation, and learning with computers (2004) Journal of Communication, 54, pp. 22-37; Davis, F.D., Perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, and user acceptance of information technology (1989) MIS Quarterly, 13, pp. 319-340; Deci, E.L., Koestner, R., Ryan, R.M., A meta-analytic review of experiments examining the effects of extrinsic rewards on intrinsic motivation (1999) Psychological Bulletin, 125, pp. 627-668; De Kort, Y.A.W., Ijsselsteijn, W.A., Poels, K., Digital games as social presence technology: Development of the social presence in gaming questionnaire (SPGQ) (2007) Proceedings of the 10th Annual International Workshoon Presence, , Barcelona, Spain; Edwards, C., Edwards, A., Spence, P.R., Westerman, D., Initial interaction expectations with robots: Testing the human-to-human interaction script (2015) Communication Studies, pp. 1-12; Escarti, A., Guzman, J.F., Effects of feedback on self-efficacy, performance, and choice in an athletic task (1999) Journal of Applied Sport Psychology, 11, pp. 83-96; Fitzsimmons, P.A., Landers, D.M., Thomas, R.J., Van Der Mars, H., Does self efficacy predict performance in experienced weight lifters?

The aim of the present study, therefore, was to develop a short media multitasking measure for adolescents (MMM-S). Two studies with a total sample of 2,278 adolescents were conducted. The findings of these studies suggest that the MMM-S is a useful, reliable, and valid measure to assess media multitasking among adolescents. The findings indicate that the concurrent validity of the short measure is equal to that of a more extensive measure. Because of its high utility, the MMM-S may provide an alternative for existing extensive measures of media multitasking. © 2016 Hogrefe Publishing.",Adolescents; Media multitasking; Short measure,,,,,,,,,"Alzahabi, R., Becker, M.W., The association between media multitasking, task-switching, and dual-task performance (2013) Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception and Performance, 39, pp. 1485-1495; Baumgartner, S.E., Weeda, W., Van Der Heijden, L., Huizinga, M., The relationship between media multitasking and executive function in early adolescents (2014) Journal of Early Adolescence, 34, pp. 1120-1144; Becker, M.W., Alzahabi, R., Hopwood, C.J., Media multitasking is associated with symptoms of depression and social anxiety (2013) Cyberpsychology, Behavior, and Social Networking, 16, pp. 132-135; Boase, J., Ling, R., Measuring mobile phone use: Selfreport versus log data (2013) Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication, 18, pp. 508-519; Borgers, N., De Leeuw, E., Hox, J., Children as respondents in survey research: Cognitive development and response quality (2000) Bulletin of Sociological Methodology, 66, pp. 60-75; Bowman, L.L., Levine, L.E., Waite, B.M., Gendron, M., Can students really multitask?

After completing a measure of intuitive morality, participants read a short scenario varying the morality of a character's behavior, and then rated their moral approbation of the behavior and liking for the character. Results indicated that moral approbation mediated the relationship between character behavior and character disposition, and that intuitive morality moderated this relationship for the violation condition. Findings highlight the importance of moral intuitions in disposition formation processes, and support the use of intuitive morality in understanding responses to media characters. © 2016 Hogrefe Publishing.",Character; Disposition; Enjoyment; Entertainment; Media; Morality,,,,,,,,,"Aiken, L.S., West, S.G., Reno, R.R., (1991) Multiple Regression: Testing and Interpreting Interactions, , Thousand Oaks CA: Sage; Baron, R.M., Kenny, D.A., The moderator-mediator variable distinction in social psychological research: Conceptual, strategic, and statistical considerations (1986) Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 51, p. 1173; Bilandzic, H., The complicated relationship between media and morality: A response to ron tamborini's model of ""moral intuition and media entertainment,"" from a narrative perspective (2011) Journal of Media Psychology, 23 (1), pp. 46-51; Eden, A., Grizzard, M.N., Lewis, R.J., Moral psychology and media theory: Historical and emerging viewpoints (2012) Media and the Moral Mind, pp. 1-26. , In R.

Both objects and photographs were presented behind glass in display showcases in a museum and, hence, were largely equivalent in terms of providing visual information. The results of Experiment 1 indicated that participants pay more attention to real objects than to respective photographs. In addition, Experiment 2 indicated that participants retrieve more memory details about an object if they have seen it as a real object in comparison with a respective photograph. This study provides the first evidence that observers take the different ontological status of photographs and real objects into account, processing the former less elaborately than the latter. More specifically, the present findings are compatible with an early-stage model, which assumes that attribution of authenticity is done heuristically at an early stage, thereby influencing the amount and depth of subsequent stages of information processing, including inspection time and cognitive elaboration. © 2016 Hogrefe Publishing.",Authenticity; Material objects; Object memory; Object perception; Photographs,,,,,,SPP 1409-SCHW 706/2-1,"The research was funded by the Deutsche Forschungs-gemeinschaft (DFG), SPP 1409-SCHW 706/2-1.

However, the majority of studies in this area have been cross-sectional in nature and/or relied on student samples. Using data from six waves of a longitudinal study with a representative sample of Dutch Internet users, we first examined whether users and nonusers of SNS differ in online social support and well-being (as indicated by life satisfaction and stress). In a second step, we investigated in more detail how SNS use – more specifically, asking for advice and the number of strong ties on these SNS – are related to online social support, stress, and satisfaction with life. Overall, our results provide no evidence for SNS use and online social support affecting either stress or life satisfaction. SNS users reported more online social support than nonusers did, but also higher levels of stress; the two groups did not differ in overall life satisfaction. With regard to the underlying processes, we found positive cross-sectional and longitudinal relationships between asking for advice on SNS and online social support, indicating that SNS can be an effective tool for receiving social support. However, online social support was not related to higher life satisfaction or reduced stress 6 months later; instead, it seems that SNS users with lower life satisfaction and/or higher stress seek more social support online by asking for advice on SNS. © 2017 Hogrefe Publishing.",Life satisfaction; Social network sites; Social support; Stress; Well-being,,,,,,"Seventh Framework Programme, FP7

We propose mindfulness as a predictor of well-being related to instant messaging. In our study, 211 participants answered short questionnaires on the evenings of five consecutive days. Multilevel analyses showed that a mindful use of instant messaging was positively related to users’ well-being, as indicated by more positive affect and less stress related to instant messaging.

With news focusing on the negative and worrisome events in the world, framing that evokes a sense of powerlessness, and lack of entertainment value, this study hypothesizes that news consumption decreases mental well-being via negative hedonic experiences; thereby, we differentiate between hard and soft news. Using a panel survey in combination with latent growth curve modeling (n = 2,767), we demonstrate that the consumption of hard news television programs has a negative effect on the development of mental well-being over time. Soft news consumption, by contrast, has a marginally positive impact on the trend in well-being. This can be explained by the differential topic focus, framing and style of soft news vis-à-vis hard news. Investigating the effects of news consumption on mental well-being provides insight into the impact news exposure has on variables other than the political ones which definitively are not less societally relevant. © 2017 Hogrefe Publishing.",Hard versus soft news; Hedonic experiences; Mental well-being; Negativity; News consumption,,,,,,"Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek, NWO

Although media scholars have suggested media use may be driven by a need to relax, related research has been sporadic and, until recently, disconnected from the larger conversation about stress management. The present research aimed to determine the relative value of media use within the broader range of coping strategies. Based on surveys of both students and breast cancer patients, media use emerged as one of the most frequently selected strategies for managing stress across a range of personality and individual difference variables. Further, heavier television consumers and those with higher perceived stress were also more likely to use media for coping purposes. Finally, those who choose media for stress management reported it to be an effective tool, although perhaps not as effective as other popular strategies. This research not only documents the centrality of media use in the corpus of stress management techniques, thus highlighting the value of academic inquiry into media-based coping, but it also offers evidence supporting the positive role media use can play in promoting psychological well-being. © 2017 Hogrefe Publishing.",Coping; Media use; Psychological well-being; Stress management,,,,,,,,,"Anderson, D., Collins, P., Schmitt, K., Jacobvitz, R., Stressful life events and television viewing (1996) Communication Research, 23 (3), pp. 243-260; Baker, J., Berenbaum, H., Emotional approach and problem-focused coping: A comparison of potentially adaptive strategies (2007) Cognition and Emotion, 21 (1), pp. 95-118; Carver, C.S., Stress, coping, and health (2007) Foundations of Health Psychology, pp. 117-144. , H.

Using structural equation modeling on cross-sectional survey responses, Study 1 (N = 300) tested relationships among offline social network size, voice and text frequency, entrapment, and well-being. Offline social network size was associated with text message frequency, and both were indirectly associated with lower subjective well-being via entrapment. Study 2 used experience sampling to confirm associations among entrapment, texting, and well-being. Participants (N = 112) reported on face-to-face, phone, and text interactions five times a day for 5 consecutive days (n = 1,879). Multilevel modeling results indicated that beginning-of-week entrapment was associated with more interactions with acquaintances and strangers, and with reporting lower affective well-being and relatedness when interacting via text. Well-being reported during text interactions and number of interactions with acquaintances and strangers during the week both predicted changes in entrapment by the week’s end. Change in entrapment was associated with lower subjective well-being at the week’s end. Results suggest that entrapment is associated with using texting to maintain larger networks of social relationships, potentially stressing individuals’ capacity to maintain less close relationships via mobile communication. © 2017 Hogrefe Publishing.",Entrapment; Experience sampling; Mobile phones; Social network; Well-being,,,,,,,,,"Arnold, M., On the phenomenology of technology: The “Janus” faces of mobile phones (2003) Information and Organization, 13, pp. 231-256; Baron, N., Concerns about mobile phones: A cross-national study (2011) First Monday, 16. , http://firstmonday.org/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/3335/3032; Bayer, J.B., Campbell, S.W., Ling, R., Connection cues: Activating the norms and habits of social connect-edness (2015) Communication Theory, 26, pp. 128-149; Baym, N.K., (2015) Personal Connections in The Digital Age, , (2nd ed).

The present study examined (a) college students’ media use for discussing their breakups with various relational partners; and (b) the association between this sharing and personal growth, a eudaimonic marker of well-being. For geographically close relationships, participants used face-to-face interaction the most for breakup-related sharing, followed by texting, and least of all the phone. This pattern was different for long-distance relationships, where texting prevailed, followed by the phone, and least of all face-to-face. Differences also emerged based on relationship type with the sharers (friends vs. family). Only face-to-face sharing with close friends was associated with sharers’ personal growth after the breakup. The results extend the social sharing theoretical framework by incorporating media factors and advance the literature on media use and psychological well-being. © 2017 Hogrefe Publishing.",Media use; Personal growth; Relationship type; Romantic breakups; Social sharing,,,,,,,,,"Argyle, M., Henderson, M., The rules of friendship (1984) Journal of Social and Personal Relationships, 1 (2), pp. 211-237; Baym, N.K., Zhang, Y.B., Kunkel, A., Ledbetter, A., Lin, M.-C., Relational quality and media use in interpersonal relationships (2007) New Media & Society, 9 (5), pp. 735-752; Bazarova, N.N., Public intimacy: Disclosure interpretation and social judgments on Facebook (2012) Journal of Communication, 62 (5), pp. 815-832; Bruner, J.S., (1990) Acts of Meaning, , Harvard University Press; Choi, M., Toma, C.L., Social sharing through interpersonal media: Patterns and effects on emotional well-being (2014) Computers in Human Behavior, 36, pp. 530-541; Christophe, V., Rimé, B., Exposure to the social sharing of emotion: Emotional impact, listener responses and secondary social sharing (1997) European Journal of Social Psychology, 27 (1), pp. 37-54; Claes, M., Simard, R., Friendship characteristics of delinquent adolescents (1992) International Journal of Adolescence and Youth, 3 (3-4), pp. 287-301; Finkenauer, C., Rimé, B., Socially shared emotional experiences vs. Emotional experiences kept secret: Differential characteristics and consequences (1998) Journal of Social and Clinical Psychology, 17 (3), pp. 295-318; Hutchby, I., Technologies, texts and affordances (2001) Sociology, 35 (4), pp. 441-456; Johnson, A.J., Examining the maintenance of friendships: Are there differences between geographically close and long-distance friends?

Yet, little is known about how different combinations of news frames and issues relate to discrete emotions and whether these emotions, in turn, affect issue perceptions. The present study investigates these questions by testing whether (a) the effects of news articles, featuring highly versus moderately contested policy issues on perceived policy effectiveness (PPE), are mediated by three discrete emotions (anger, fear, and hope) and (b) if these effects depend on the type of generic news frame used (human interest vs. economic consequences). An online experimental survey (N = 405) demonstrated that the effects of issue contestation on PPE were mediated by hope and anger, but not by fear. These effects were only apparent within a human interest frame. The theoretical and practical implications of these results are discussed. © 2016 Hogrefe Publishing.",Contested issues; Discrete emotions; Moderated mediation; News framing effects,,,,,,,,,"Aarøe, L., Investigating frame strength: The case of episodic and thematic frames (2011) Political Communication, 28 (2), pp. 207-226; Baumann, J., De-Steno, D., Emotion guided threat detection: Expecting guns where there are none (2010) Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 99 (4), pp. 595-610; Baumeister, R.F., Bratslavsky, E., Finkenauer, C., Vohs, K.D., Bad is stronger than good (2001) Review of General Psychology, 5 (4), pp. 323-370; Baumeister, R.F., Leary, M.R., The need to belong: Desire for interpersonal attachments as a fundamental human motivation (1995) Psychological Bulletin, 117 (3), pp. 497-529; Baumeister, R.F., Vohs, K.D., De-Wall, C.N., Zhang, L., How emotion shapes behavior: Feedback, anticipation, and reflection, rather than direct causation (2007) Personality and Social Psychology Review, 11 (2), pp. 167-203; Baumgartner, H., Pieters, R., Bagozzi, R.P., Future-oriented emotions: Conceptualization and behavioral effects (2008) European Journal of Social Psychology, 38 (4), pp. 685-696; Bigsby, E., Cappella, J.N., Seitz, H.H., Efficiently and effectively evaluating public service announcements: Additional evidence for the utility of perceived effectiveness (2013) Communication Monographs, 80 (1), pp. 1-23; Cantarow, E., The downwinders: Fracking ourselves to death in Pennsylvania (2013) Le Monde Diplomatique, , http://mondediplomatique.com, (August 10).

At the same time, there has been controversial debate over the possible influences of such polls on voters' electoral choices. The most prominent influence discussed is the bandwagon effect: It states that voters tend to support the expected winner of an upcoming election, and use polls to determine who the likely winner will be. This study investigated the mechanisms underlying the effect. In addition, we inquired into the role of past electoral performances of a candidate and analyzed how these (as well as polls) are used as heuristic cues for the assessment of a candidate's personal characteristics. Using an experimental design, we found that both polls and past election results influence participants' expectations regarding which candidate will succeed. Moreover, higher competence was attributed to a candidate, if recipients believe that the majority of voters favor that candidate. Through this attribution of competence, both information about prior elections and current polls shaped voters' electoral preferences. © 2016 Hogrefe Publishing.",Bandwagon effect; Competence attribution; Electoral preferences; Incumbency bonus,,,,,,,,,"Ajzen, I., Fishbein, M., (1980) Understanding Attitudes and Predicting Social Behavior, , Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice-Hall; Anderson, C.J., Brettschneider, F., The likeable winner versus the competent loser.

Simultaneously, media discourses have flared up debating diplomatic and military solutions as possible policy responses. A majority of Germans, however, have remained hesitant to advocate any escalation of military conflict. We were interested in how far reputable journalism concerning the Ukraine crisis might activate a disposition toward military engagement. To evaluate the supposed impact of actual news coverage, we used explicit existential threats (mortality salience; MS) as a comparative measure. Typical effects of MS were derived from terror management theory (TMT), which predicts that the awareness of existential threats amplifies the efforts to defend one's own culture, even by military means. We used a 2 × 2 factorial design (N = 112) with the factors article (original bellicose vs. neutral, nonmilitant depiction) and salience condition (MS vs. control). Results revealed a strong impact of the original, bellicose article, with increased willingness to deploy German forces at the Russian border, independently of the salience condition. Additional existential threats did not add further effects, as values for willingness were already very high. Classic effects regarding TMT were observed when people had read the Non-Militant article. Here, the willingness to deploy forces only increased after a confrontation with existential threats. We conclude that threatening news coverage on the Ukraine crisis has the ability to alter willingness for first-step military action at the Russian border by inducing effects that are - at least in their outcome - comparable to explicit existential threats. © 2016 Hogrefe Publishing.",Media depiction; Mortality salience; Politics; Terror management theory (TMT); Threat; Ukraine crisis,,,,,,,,,"Amann, M., Blome, N., Gebauer, M., Neukirch, R., Schult, C., (2014) Nato-Alarm, , http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-126267960.html, Retrieved from; Arena, J., Making things more public: On the political responsibility of the media intellectual (1995) Political Communication, 12 (3), pp. 345-346; Arendt, F., Marquart, F., Matthes, J., Effects of right-wing populist political advertising on implicit and explicit stereotypes (2015) Journal of Media Psychology, , Advance Online Publication; Balmas, M., Sheafer, T., Wolfsfeld, G., Enemies also get their say: Press performance during political crises (2015) International Journal of Communication, 9 (21). , doi: 1932-8036/20150005; Baum, M.A., Sex, lies, and war: How soft news brings foreign policy to the inattentive public (2002) American Political Science Review, 96 (1), pp. 91-109; Bickes, H., Otten, T., Weymann, L.C., The financial crisis in the German and English press: Metaphorical structures in the media coverage on Greece, Spain and Italy (2014) Discourse & Society, 25 (4), pp. 424-445; Burke, B.L., Martens, A., Faucher, E.H., Two decades of terror management theory: A meta-analysis of mortality salience research (2010) Personality and Social Psychology Review, 14 (2), pp. 155-195; Buzan, B., (2008) People, States & Fear: An Agenda for International Security Studies in the Post-Cold War Era, , Colchester, UK: ECPR Press; (2015) Performance Data, , http://www.spiegel-qc.de/medien/print/der-spiegel/performance-data, Retrieved from; Echebarria-Echabe, A., Perez, S., The impact of different procedures to arouse mortality awareness on various worldview dimensions (2015) European Journal of Social Psychology, , Advance online publication; Entman, R.M., How the media affect what people think: An information processing approach (1989) The Journal of Politics, 51 (2), pp. 347-370; Faul, F., Erdfelder, E., Lang, A.G., Buchner, A., G∗Power 3: A flexible statistical power analysis program for the social, behavioral, and biomedical sciences (2007) Behavior Research Methods, 39 (2), pp. 175-191; Ferring, D., Filipp, S.H., Measurement of self-esteem: Findings on reliability, validity, and stability of the Rosenberg Scale (1996) Diagnostica, 42 (3), pp. 284-292; Fischer, P., Greitemeyer, T., Kastenmüller, A., Frey, D., Oßwald, S., Terror salience and punishment: Does terror salience induce threat to social order?

This study focuses on the unique risk aspects of the college and university environment with a preregistered survey comparing three competing models of video games' possible role (games as risk, incapacitation, or inconsequential) in predicting alcohol and substance use, sexual risk, interpersonal violence, bullying victimization, suicide, disordered eating, and exercise to provide a baseline measure of what role, if any, video games play in the college and university risk environment. Video game play was most consistently associated with outcomes related to suicide and interpersonal violence, and more sporadically associated with some other outcomes. © 2017 Hogrefe Publishing.",College; Risk; University health; Video games,,,,,,,,,"Abbey, A., Acquaintance rape and alcohol consumption on college campuses: How are they linked?

In Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) videos are generally the most used method of teaching. While most MOOCs are offered in English, the global availability of these courses has attracted many non-native English speakers. To ensure not only the availability, but also the accessibility of open online education, courses should be designed to minimize detrimental effects of a language barrier, for example by providing subtitles. However, with many conflicting research findings it is unclear whether subtitles are beneficial or detrimental for learning from a video, and whether this depends on characteristics of the learner and the video. We hypothesized that the effect of 2nd language subtitles on learning outcomes depends on the language proficiency of the student, as well as the visual-textual information complexity of the video. This three-way interaction was tested in an experimental study. No main effect of subtitles was found, nor any interaction. However, the student's language proficiency and the complexity of the video do have a substantial impact on learning outcomes. © 2017 Hogrefe Publishing.",MOOCs; Multimedia; Online education; Subtitles; Video,,,,,,,,,"Baddeley, A., Working memory: Looking back and looking forward (2003) Nature Reviews Neuroscience, 4 (10), pp. 829-839; Baguley, T., Standardized or simple effect size: What should be reported?

How can this connection with nature be created? We examined whether viewing nature-related videos - specifically, the immersiveness of the technological devices used to display these videos - can enhance connection with nature and increase pro-environmental behavior. Participants watched videos of either natural or built environments through a head-mounted display (immersive technology) or a regular computer screen. We predicted that watching a nature video would enhance nature relatedness and pro-environmental behaviors, particularly when presented with immersive technology than with a traditional computer monitor. There was limited support for the hypotheses; watching the nature video significantly enhanced nature relatedness but not pro-environmental behaviors. The type of technology used did not influence the effect of the videos. © 2017 Hogrefe Publishing.",Environmental behavior; Immersive technology; Nature; Presence,,,,,,,,,"Ahn, S.J., Bailenson, J.N., Park, D., Short- and long-term effects of embodied experiences in immersive virtual environments on environmental locus of control and behavior (2014) Computers in Human Behavior, 39, pp. 235-245; Aron, A., Aron, E.N., Smollan, D., Inclusion of other in the self scale and the structure of interpersonal closeness (1992) Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 63, pp. 596-612; Aron, A., Aron, E.N., Tudor, M., Nelson, G., Close relationships as including other in the self (1991) Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 60, pp. 241-253; Bailey, J.O., Bailenson, J.N., Flora, J., Armel, K.C., Voelker, D., Reeves, B., The impact of vivid messages on reducing energy consumption related to hot water use (2014) Environment and Behavior, 47 (5), pp. 570-592; Baños, R.M., Botella, C., Alcañiz, M., Liaño, V., Guerrero, B., Rey, B., Immersion and emotion: Their impact on the sense of presence (2004) Cyber Psychology & Behavior, 7 (6), pp. 734-741; Bashir, N.Y., Wilson, A.E., Lockwood, P., Chasteen, A.L., Alisat, S., The time for action is now: Subjective temporal proximity enhances pursuit of remote-future goals (2014) Social Cognition, 32 (1), pp. 83-93; Blascovich, J., Loomis, J., Beall, A., Swinth, K., Hoyt, C., Bailenson, J.N., Immersive virtual environment technology as a methodological tool for social psychology (2002) Psychological Inquiry, 13, pp. 103-124; Capaldi, C.A., Dopko, R.L., Zelenski, J.M., The relationship between nature connectedness and happiness: A metaanalysis (2014) Frontiers in Psychology, 5, p. 976; Davydenko, M., Peetz, J., (2015) Effects of Nature on Time Perception, Unpublished Manuscript; De Kort, Y.A.W., Meijnders, A.L., Sponselee, A.A.G., Ijsselsteijn, W.A., What's wrong with virtual trees?

Emerging research has found that when people play together, the resulting teamwork can have beneficial impacts on their prosocial orientations after gameplay - especially when the players are cooperative with one another. The present study wanted to expand the scope of these beneficial interpersonal effects by considering both inter- and intrapersonal factors. In an experimental study (N = 115) we manipulated the difficulty of a game (easy or hard) and the behavior of a confederate teammate (supportive or unsupportive playing style). We found that neither coplayer supportiveness nor game difficulty had an effect on the expectations of a teammate's prosocial behavior or one's own prosocial behavior toward the teammate after the game (operationalized as willingness to share small amounts of money with one's teammate after playing). Increased expectations of prosocial behavior from one's teammate were related to one's own prosocial behaviors, independent of our manipulations. Considering these results, we propose alternative theoretical approaches to understanding complex social interactions in video games. Furthermore, we suggest to explore other types of manipulations of game difficulty and cooperation between video game players as well as alternative measures of prosocial behavior. © 2017 Hogrefe Publishing.",Challenge; Prosocial behavior; Reciprocity; Social play; Video games,,,,,,,,,"Adachi, P.J., Hodson, G., Willoughby, T., Zanette, S., Brothers and sisters in arms: Intergroup cooperation in a violent shooter game can reduce intergroup bias (2015) Psychology of Violence, 5 (4), pp. 455-462; Bowman, N.D., Video gaming as co-production (2016) Producing 2.0: The Intersection of Audiences and Production in A Digital World, 2, pp. 107-123. , In R.

A growing amount of research on games advocating social change, including those focusing on interactive narratives, has highlighted their potential for attitudinal and behavioral impact. In this study, we examine the relationship between interactivity and prosocial behavior, as well as potential underlying processes. A yoked study design with 634 participants compared an interactive with a noninteractive narrative. Structural equation modeling revealed no significant differences in prosocial behavior between the interactive and noninteractive condition. However, support for the importance of appreciation for and engagement with a narrative on subsequent prosocial behavior was observed. In summary, while results shed light on processes underlying the relationship between both noninteractive and interactive narratives and prosocial behavior, they also highlight interactivity as a multifaceted concept worth examining in further detail. © 2017 Hogrefe Publishing.",Appreciation; Games for change; Interactive narrative; Prosocial behavior; Yoked design,,,,,,,,,"Bandura, A., Barbaranelli, C., Caprara, G.V., Pastorelli, C., Mechanisms of moral disengagement in the exercise of moral agency (1996) Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 71 (2), p. 364; Bartsch, A., Kalch, A., Oliver, M.B., Moved to think: The role of emotional media experiences in stimulating reflective thoughts (2014) Journal of Media Psychology, 26 (3), p. 125; Botti, S., McGill, A.L., When choosing is not deciding: The effect of perceived responsibility on satisfaction (2006) Journal of Consumer Research, 33 (2), pp. 211-219; Bucy, E.P., Tao, C.-C., The mediated moderation model of interactivity (2007) Media Psychology, 9 (3), pp. 647-672; Busselle, R., Bilandzic, H., Measuring narrative engagement (2009) Media Psychology, 12 (4), pp. 321-347; Button, K.S., Ioannidis, J.P., Mokrysz, C., Nosek, B.A., Flint, J., Robinson, E.S., Munafò, M.R., Power failure: Why small sample size undermines the reliability of neuroscience (2013) Nature Reviews Neuroscience, 14 (5), pp. 365-376; Čehajić, S., Brown, R., González, R., What do i care?

Objectification theory and the disinhibition effect were used as theoretical grounding for the study.

An experiment (N = 77) was conducted to investigate the contributions of the two types of bandwagon behaviors to the selections of Hollywood movies online and to identify factors moderating such bandwagon effects. The results showed that cognitive load was negatively associated with the strength of qualitative bandwagon effects, while positively associated with the strength of quantitative bandwagon effects. Although it was marginally significant, the results also showed that the impact of the quantitative bandwagon effect became stronger when individuals were less familiar with Hollywood movies. Implications with respect to tendency for choice imitation, as well as the conceptual understanding of and methodological approach to the bandwagon behaviors in movie selection, are discussed. © 2015 Hogrefe Publishing.",Bandwagon effect; Information processing; Movie selection; Poisson regression analysis,,,,,,,,,"Axsom, D., Yates, S., Chaiken, S., Audience response as a heuristic cue in persuasion (1987) Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 53, pp. 30-40; Baloglu, S., Image variations of Turkey by familiarity index: Informational and experiential dimensions (2001) Tourism Management, 22, pp. 127-133; Bass, F.M., A new product growth model for consumer durables (1969) Management Science, 15, pp. 215-227; Bettman, J.R., Park, C.W., Effects of prior knowledge and experience and phase of the choice process on consumer decision processes: A protocol analysis (1980) Journal of Consumer Research, 7, pp. 234-248; Bornstein, B.H., The impact of different types of expert scientific testimony on mock jurors' liability verdicts (2004) Psychology, Crime & Law, 10, pp. 429-446; Brewer, M.B., A dual process model of impression formation (1988) Advances in Social Cognition, 1, pp. 1-36. , In T.

This study examined how sampling frequency and time of day of contact impacted on response rates, response completeness, and response delay in repeated measures data collected via SMS. Eighty-five undergraduate students completed a six-item self-report questionnaire via SMS, in response to 20 SMS prompts sent on a random schedule. One group responded across 2 days, the other on a compressed schedule of 1 day. Overall, there was a high response rate. There was no significant difference in response rate, completeness, and delay of those responding across 1 or 2 days. Timing between prompts did not impact on response behavior. Responses were more likely to be complete if prompts were sent during the working day. The shortest time between prompts was 15 min, however, and use of an undergraduate sample limits generalizability. When conducting repeated measures sampling using SMS, researchers should be aware that more frequent sampling can be associated with poorer data quality, and should aim to collect data during the working day rather than mornings or evenings. © 2015 Hogrefe Publishing.",Data quality; Methodology; Mobile telephone; Short message service,,,,,,,,,"Anhoj, J., Moldrup, C., Feasibility of collecting diary data from asthma patients through mobile phones and SMS (short message service): Response rate analysis and focus group evaluation from a pilot study (2009) Journal of Medical Internet Research, 6, p. e42; Australian Communications and Media Authority, (2013) ACMA Communications Report 2012-2013, , http://www.acma.gov.au/theACMA/Library/Corporate-library/Corporate-publications/communications-report-2012-13, Retrieved from; Baruch, Y., Response rate in academic studies: A comparative analysis (1999) Human Relations, 52, pp. 421-438; Baruch, Y., Holtom, B.C., Survey response rate levels and trends in organizational research (2008) Human Relations, 61, pp. 1139-1160; Berkman, E.T., Dickenson, J., Falk, E.B., Lieberman, M.D., Using SMS text messaging to assess moderators of smoking reduction: Validating a new tool for ecological measurement of health behaviors (2011) Health Psychology, 30, pp. 186-194; Bolger, N., Davis, A., Rafaeli, E., Diary methods: Capturing life as it is lived (2003) Annual Review of Psychology, 54, pp. 579-616; Cocco, M., Tuzzi, A., New data collection modes for surveys: A comparative analysis of the influence of survey mode on question-wording effects Quality and Quantity, 47, pp. 3135-3152; Conner, T.S., Reid, K.A., Effects of intensive mobile happiness reporting in daily life (2012) Social Psychological and Personality Science, 3, pp. 315-323; Cook, C., Heath, F., Thompson, R.L., A meta-analysis of response rates in Web-or Internet-based surveys (2000) Educational and Psychological Measurement, 60, pp. 821-836; Cranford, J.A., Shrout, P.E., Iida, M., Rafaeli, E., Yip, T., Bolger, N., A procedure for evaluating sensitivity to within-person change: Can mood measures in diary studies detect change reliably?

Psychophysiological measures were used to observe real-time variation in mental processes activated when individuals viewed narrative content that was manipulated in two fundamental content characteristics: cohesion and emotional content. The results of a 2 (low vs. high cohesion) ×2 (low vs. high emotional content) ×3 (video clips) mixed model repeated measures experiment showed consistent influences of cohesion and emotional content on self-reported narrative engagement as well as psychophysiological indicators (heart rate, skin conductance, corrugator activity). Confirming the hypotheses, self-reported attentional focus was related to lower levels of heart rate, while self-reported emotional engagement was positively related to corrugator activity. Both attentional focus and emotional engagement were related to increases of skin conductance levels over time. The results support the validity of the dimensional concept of narrative engagement and open further avenues for clarifying mechanisms of narrative persuasion. © 2015 Hogrefe Publishing.",Emotions; Narrative engagement; Narrative processing; Psychophysiological processes,,,,,,,,,"Abbott, H.P., (2002) The Cambridge Introduction to Narrative, , Cambridge: University Press; Andreassi, J.L., (2007) Psychophysiology: Human Behavior and Physiological Response, , Mahwah, NJ: Erlbaum; Bailey, R., Wise, K., Bolls, P.D., How avatar customizability affects children's arousal and subjective presence during junk food-sponsored online video games (2009) CyberPsychology & Behavior, 12, pp. 277-283; Berger, C.R., Lee, K.J., Second thoughts, second feelings: Attenuating the impact of threatening narratives through rational reappraisal (2011) Communication Research, 38 (1), pp. 3-26; Bolls, P.D., Understanding emotion from a superordinate dimensional perspective: A productive way forward for communication processes and effects studies (2010) Communication Monographs, 77 (2), pp. 146-152; Bolls, P.D., Wise, K., Bradley, S., Embodied motivated cognition: A theoretical framework for studying dynamic mental processes underlying advertising exposure (2012) Advertising Theory, pp. 105-119. , In S.

We also demonstrate that interactivity effects are, to some extent, contingent on citizens political cynicism.

This study examines how use of different news types (hard and soft TV news as well as printed and online versions of broadsheet and tabloid newspapers) indirectly affects changes in offline and online political participation through current affairs knowledge and internal efficacy during nonelection and election time. We use a four-wave national panel survey from Denmark (N = 2,649) and show that use of hard TV news and broadsheets as well as online tabloids positively affects changes in both offline and online political participation through current affairs knowledge and internal efficacy. Use of soft TV news and printed tabloids has a negative indirect effect. These results are more pronounced for online political participation and during election time. However, use of soft TV news also has a positive direct effect on changes in political participation, which suggests a positive impact via other processes. © 2016 Hogrefe Publishing.",Indirect media effects; News types; Political efficacy; Political knowledge; Political participation,,,,,,,,,"Albaek, E., Van Dalen, A., De Vreese, C.H., Jebril, N., (2014) Political Journalism in Comparative Perspective, , New York, NY: Cambridge University Press; Andersen, K., De Vreese, C.H., Albaek, E., Measuring media diet in a high-choice environment-testing the listfrequency technique (2016) Communication Methods and Measures, 10 (2-3), pp. 81-98; Bakker, T.P., De Vreese, C.H., Good news for the future?

Contrary to the slacktivism hypothesis that claims online collective action to lack an apparent impact on the real world, the current study indicates a facilitating role of online collective action in the Gezi Park protests. By means of a large-scale online survey (N = 1,127) and a subsequent latent path analysis, the study demonstrates that the endurance of the movement was kept alive by both offline and online collective actions. The relationship between offline/online action and protest motivations was mediated by three predictors of collective action derived from the SIMCA: perceived injustice, social identity, and perceived efficacy. Results show that protestors in Turkey, independent of whether they became active in the digital or the real world, were likely to protest again to the extent that they perceived developments in Turkey as unjust, identified strongly with the Çapulcus [Turkish for looters] as a social group, and perceived this group to be efficient in changing social injustice in the country. © 2016 Hogrefe Publishing.",Collective action; Gezi Park protests; Perceived efficacy; SIMCA; Slacktivism; Social identity,,,,,,,,,"Acar, Y.G., Uluǧ, O.M., Becoming us without being one"": A social psychological perspective on the gezi park protesters and negotiating levels of identity (2015) Another Brick in the Barricade: The Gezi Resistance and Its Aftermath, pp. 34-54. , In G.

The results reveal that exposure to cross-cutting social media news can motivate cheap participation better than costly participation. Moreover, the mobilizing effects of cross-cutting exposure are mediated by anger and anxiety, as suggested by affective intelligence theory and appraisal theories of emotion. The mediating effects of anxiety are also moderated by online incivility. Implications are discussed in terms of the role of social media use and cross-cutting exposure in participatory democracies. © 2016 Hogrefe Publishing.",Anger; Anxiety; Cross-cutting exposure; Political participation; Social media,,,,,,,,,"Bakshy, E., Messing, S., Adamic, L.A., Exposure to ideologically diverse news and opinion on facebook (2015) Science, 348 (6239), pp. 1130-1132; Barthel, M., Shearer, E., Gottfried, J., Mitchell, A., News habits on facebook and twitter (2015) Pew Research Center, , http://www.journalism.org/2015/07/14/news-habits-on-facebook-And-twitter, Retrieved from; Bode, L., Vrage, E.K., Borah, P., Shah, D.V., A new space for political behavior: Political social networking and its democratic consequences (2014) Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication, 19 (3), pp. 414-425; Borah, P., Interactions of news frames and incivility in the political blogosphere: Examining perceptual outcomes (2013) Political Communication, 30 (3), pp. 456-473; Borah, P., Does it matter where you read the news story?

However, the effects of such disclosures remain largely unstudied. Departing from theoretical notions of the persuasion knowledge model, this study examined how different types of disclosures and viewer involvement with a movie clip affected attitudes toward the placed brand. In addition, the role of attitude toward the placement as mediator was tested. The study employed a one-factorial (no disclosure, disclosure of source, disclosure of source and intent) between-subjects design using an online survey (N = 191). The results showed that disclosure of both the commercial source and the persuasive intent of brand placement resulted in more negative placement attitudes and in turn in more negative brand attitudes than in the absence of a disclosure. In addition, involvement with the movie moderated the disclosure effects: The brand attitudes of high-involved viewers became more negative via placement attitudes when disclosures were shown, regardless of the type of disclosure. For low-involved viewers, a disclosure of both the commercial source and the persuasive intent was necessary to affect brand attitude negatively via placement attitude. These results show that brand placement disclosures can mitigate persuasion. However, the effects depend on the disclosure type and movie involvement. These findings have important implications for theory, legislation, and practice. © 2015 Hogrefe Publishing.",Advertising; Brand placement; Disclosure; Involvement; Label,,,,,,,,,"Aggarwal, P., The effects of brand relationship norms on consumer attitude and behavior (2004) Journal of Consumer Research, 31, pp. 87-101; Anand, P., Sternthal, B., Ease of message processing as moderator of repetition effects in advertising (1990) Journal of Marketing Research, 27, pp. 345-353; Batra, R., Stayman, The role of mood in advertising effectiveness (1990) Journal of Consumer Research, 17, pp. 203-214; Benjamin, B.M., Better disclosure: How to make product integration more transparent for viewers (2005) Mediaweek, 15, p. 19; Boerman, S.C., Van Reijmersdal, E.A., Neijens, P.C., Sponsorship disclosure: Effects of duration on persuasion knowledge and brand responses (2012) Journal of Communication, 62, pp. 1047-1064; Boerman, S.C., Van Reijmersdal, E.A., Neijens, P.C., Effects of sponsorship disclosure timing on the processing of sponsored content: A study on the effectiveness of European disclosure regulations (2014) Psychology & Marketing, 31, pp. 214-224; Brown, S.P., Stayman, D.M., Antecedents and consequences of attitude toward the ad: A meta-analysis (1992) Journal of Consumer Research, 19, pp. 34-51; Buijzen, M., Van Reijmersdal, E.A., Owen, L.H., Introducing the PCMC model: An investigative framework for young people's processing of commercialized media content (2010) Communication Theory, 20, pp. 427-450; Cain, R.M., Embedded advertising on television: Disclosure, deception, and free speech rights (2011) Journal of Public Policy & Marketing, 30, pp. 226-238; Campbell, M.C., Kirmani, A., Consumers' use of persuasion knowledge: The effects of accessibility and cognitive capacity on perceptions of an influence agent (2000) Journal of Consumer Research, 27, pp. 69-83; Campbell, M.C., Mohr, G.S., Verlegh, P.W.J., Can disclosures lead consumers to resist covert persuasion? the important roles of disclosure timing and type of response (2013) Journal of Consumer Psychology, 23, pp. 483-495; Castleberry, S.B., Ehrenberg, A.S.C., Brand usage: A factor in consumer beliefs (1990) Marketing Research, 2, pp. 14-20; Cowley, E., Barron, C., When product placement goes wrong (2008) Journal of Advertising, 37, pp. 89-98; Dekker, K., Van Reijmersdal, E.A., Brand placement disclosures to mitigate persuasion: The role of celebrity endorsement and disclosure type (2013) Journal of Promotion Management, 19, pp. 224-240; Edwards, S.M., Li, H., Lee, J., Forced exposure and psychological reactance: Antecedents and consequences of the perceived intrusiveness of pop-up ads (2002) Journal of Advertising, 31, pp. 83-95; Friestad, M., Wright, P., The persuasion knowledge model: How people cope with persuasion attempts (1994) Journal of Consumer Research, 22, pp. 1-31; Hass, R.G., Grady, K., Temporal delay, type of forewarning, and resistance to influence (1975) Journal of Experimental Social Psychology, 11, pp. 459-469; Hayes, A.F., (2013) Introduction to Mediation, Moderation and Conditional Process Analyses, , New York: Guilford Press; (2013) User Ratings for Spider-Man, , http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0145487/ratings?ref_=tt_ov_rt; Jöckel, S., Blake, C., Schlutz, D., Influence of agerating label salience on perception and evaluation of media: An eye-tracking study (2013) Journal of Media Psychology: Theories, Methods, & Applications, 25, pp. 83-94; Kim, B., Pasadeos, Y., Barban, A., On the deceptive effectiveness of labeled and unlabeled advertorial formats (2001) Mass Communication and Society, 4, pp. 265-281; Kim, J., Lim, J.-S., Bhargava, M., The role of affect in attitude formation: A classical conditioning approach (1998) Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science, 26, pp. 143-152; Kuhn, K.L., Hume, M., Love, A., Examining the covert nature of product placement: Implications for public policy (2010) Journal of Promotion Management, 16, pp. 59-79; Lord, K.R., Putrevu, S., Advertising and publicity: An information processing perspective (1993) Journal of Economic Psychology, 14, pp. 57-84; MacKenzie, S.B., Lutz, R.J., Belch, G.E., The role of attitude toward the ad as a mediator of advertising effectiveness: A test of competing explanations (1986) Journal of Marketing Research, 23, pp. 130-143; Mitchell, A.A., Olsen, J.C., Are product attribute beliefs the only mediator of advertising effects on brand attitude?

However, little is known about the psychological processes at work when viewing these programs. This study examined how social comparisons to cast members influenced emotional responses to reality television programming. Participants (N = 231) were cued with a specific comparison target group and placed in a situation of self-image enhancement or threat. Afterwards, participants watched a clip from a reality television program and then reported their emotional reactions to it. The manipulations of comparison target group and self-image affected both the direction of social comparisons made and their associated emotional responses. Participant gender also influenced social comparisons to the cast members and resulting emotional responses to the content. Although we were unable to compare the social comparison-related emotional responses to reality programs with those of scripted programs, the results of this study bring to bear the associations between specific emotional responses and the types of social comparisons that take place when watching reality television programming. © 2015 Hogrefe Publishing.",Emotions; Reality television; Social comparison,,,,,,,,,"Adalian, J., The 2011-12 TV season: What we watched and what we skipped (2012) Vulture, , http://www.vulture.com/2012/06/201112-tv-season-by-thenumbers.html, June 21); Aubrey, J.S., Olson, L., Fine, M., Hauser, T., Rhea, D., Kaylor, B., Yang, A., Investigating personality and viewingmotivation correlates of reality television exposure (2012) Communication Quarterly, 60 (1), pp. 80-102; Bessenoff, G., Can the media affect us?

Specifically, we studied the moderating role of relationship status (Experiments 1 and 2) and satisfaction with one's relationship or with being single (Experiment 2). Women (aged 18-30), who were single or in a relationship, watched an erotic scene with a likable or unlikable sexual female main character who had casual sex. In both experiments, women in a relationship were less willing to have casual sex than single women, after they had seen a likable sexual female character. However, an unpredicted effect was found in Experiment 2. After seeing an unlikable sexual female character, women who were dissatisfied with their relationship or with being single were more willing to have casual sex than their satisfied counterparts. © 2015 Hogrefe Publishing.",Media effects; Sex; Television; Women; Young adults,,,,,,,,,"Allen, M., Emmers-Sommer, T.M., D'Alessio, D., Timmerman, L., Hanzal, A., Korus, J., The connection between the physiological and psychological reactions to sexually explicit materials: A literature summary using meta-analysis (2007) Communication Monographs, 74, pp. 541-560; Attwood, F., What do people do with porn?

This study aimed to clarify whether there was a difference in levels of self-objectification among female participants who viewed objectifying images of women, body-competent images of women, or product-only images. A sample of undergraduate females was primed with one of the above image types, after which they completed the Twenty Statements Test (TST) to examine their preoccupation with their own appearance. Results revealed that those who were primed with objectifying images of women exhibited more self-objectification than women who were primed with either body-competent images of women or product-only images. There was also no significant difference between those who only viewed products and those who viewed body-competent images of women.

In an online experiment, 176 students were randomly divided into two groups (n = 88) and asked to estimate how much they, their closest friends, and young people in general enjoyed either serious or lighthearted movies. These self-other differences in perceived enjoyment of serious or light-hearted movies were also assessed as a function of differing individual motivations underlying entertainment media consumption. The results showed a clear third-person effect for light-hearted movies and a first-person effect for serious movies. The third-person effect for light-hearted movies was moderated by level of hedonic motivation, as participants with high hedonic motivations did not perceive their own and others' enjoyment of light-hearted films differently. However, eudaimonic motivations did not moderate first-person perceptions in the case of serious films. © 2015 Hogrefe Publishing.",Enjoyment; Eudaimonic motivations; Hedonic motivations; Light-hearted films; Serious films; Social distance; Third-person perception,,,,,,,,,"Baruh, L., Mediated voyeurism and the guilty pleasure of consuming reality television (2010) Media Psychology, 13, pp. 201-221; Davison W, P., The third-person effect in communication (1983) Public Opinion Quarterly, 47 (1), pp. 1-15; Gottdiener, M., Hegemony and mass culture: A semiotic approach (1985) American Journal of Sociology, 90, p. 979; Gunther, A.C., Mundy, P., Biased optimism and the third-person effect (1993) Journalism Quarterly, 70, pp. 58-67; Hall, A., The social implications of enjoyment of different types of music, movies, and television programming (2007) Western Journal of Communication, 71, pp. 259-271; Hoffner, C., Plotkin, R.S., Buchanan, M., Anderson, J.D., Kamigaki, S.K., Hubbs, L.A., Pastorek, A., The third-person effect in perceptions of the influence of television violence (2001) Journal of Communication, 51, pp. 283-299; Kim, K., Oliver, M.B., Third-person perceptions and different movie genres (2012) Paper Presented at the International Communication Association, Boston, MA, , May; Lee, B., Tamborini, R., Third-person effect and internet pornography: The influence of collectivism and internet self-efficacy (2005) Journal of Communication, 55, pp. 292-310; Leone, R., Peek, W.C., Bissell, K.L., Reality television and third-person perception (2006) Journal of Broadcasting & Electronic Media, 50, pp. 253-269; McLeod, D.M., Eveland, W.P., Nathanson, A.I., Support for censorship of violent and misogynic rap lyrics: An analysis of the third-person effect (1997) Communication Research, 24, pp. 153-174; Meirick, P.C., Rethinking the target corollary: The effects of social distance, perceived exposure, and perceived predispositions on first-person and third-person perceptions (2005) Communication Research, 32, pp. 822-843; Oliver, M.B., Bartsch, A., Appreciation as audience response: Exploring entertainment gratifications beyond hedonism (2010) Human Communication Research, 36, pp. 53-81; Oliver, M.B., Bartsch, A., Appreciation of entertainment: The importance of meaningfulness via virtue and wisdom (2011) Journal of Media Psychology, 23, pp. 29-33; Oliver, M.B., Hartmann, T., Woolley, J.K., Elevation in response to entertainment portrayals of moral virtue (2012) Human Communication Research, 38, pp. 360-378; Oliver, M.B., Raney, A.A., Entertainment as pleasurable and meaningful: Identifying hedonic and eudaimonic motivations for entertainment consumption (2011) Journal of Communication, 61, pp. 984-1004; Peiser, W., Peter, J., Third-person perception of television-viewing behavior (2000) Journal of Communication, 50, pp. 25-45; Reinecke, L., Tamborini, R., Grizzard, M., Lewis, R., Eden, A., David Bowman, N., Characterizing mood management as need satisfaction: The effects of intrinsic needs on selective exposure and mood repair (2012) Journal of Communication, 62, pp. 437-453; Salwen, M.B., Dupagne, M., Third-person perception of television violence: The role of self-perceived knowledge (2001) Media Psychology, 3, pp. 211-236; Tal-Or, N., Drukman, D., Third-person perception as an impression management tactic (2010) Media Psychology, 13, pp. 301-322; Tal-Or, N., Tsfati, Y., Gunther, A.C., The influence of presumed media influence: Origins and implications of the third-person perception (2009) The Sage Handbook of Media Processes and Effects, pp. 99-112. , R L.

The present paper introduces the Spatial Presence Experience Scale (SPES), a short eight-item self-report measure. The SPES is derived from a process model of spatial presence (Wirth et al., 2007, Media Psychology, 9, 493-525), and assesses spatial presence as a two-dimensional construct that comprises a user's self-location and perceived possible actions in a media environment. The SPES is shorter than many other available spatial presence scales, and can be conveniently applied to diverse media settings. Two studies are reported (N1 = 290, N2 = 395) that confirm sound psychometric qualities for the SPES. © 2015 Hogrefe Publishing.",Immersion; Measurement; Self-report; Spatial presence,,,,,,,,,"Baumgartner, T., Valco, L., Esslen, M., Jäncke, L., Neural correlate of Spatial Presence in an arousing and noninteractive virtual reality: An EEG and psychophysiology study (2006) Cyberpsychology & Behavior, 9, pp. 30-45; Bearden, W.O., Netemeyer, R.G., Mobley, M.F., (1993) Handbook of Marketing Scales Multi-item Measures for Marketing and Consumer Behavior Research, , Newbury Park, CA Sage; Biocca, F., The cyborg's dilemma: Progressive embodiment in virtual environments (1997) Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication, 3 (2), pp. 1-18. , http://jcmc.indiana.edu/vol3/issue2/biocca2.html; Blascovich, J., Loomis, J., Beall, A., Swinth, K., Hoyt, C., Bailenson, J., Immersive virtual environment technology as a methodological tool for social psychology (2002) Psychological Inquiry, 13, pp. 103-124; Bormann, K., Presence and the utility of audio spatialization (2005) Presence: Teleoperators and Virtual Environments, 14, pp. 278-297; Bourke, P.A., Duncan, J., Nimmo-Smith, I., A general factor in dual-Task performance decrement (1996) The Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology, 49, pp. 525-545; Bracken, C.C., Presence and image quality: The case of high-definition television (2005) Media Psychology, 7, pp. 191-205; Brogni, A., Slater, M., Steed, A., More breaks less presence (2003) Proceedings of the 6th Annual International Workshop on Presence, , http://www0.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/M.Slater/Papers/bipspres.pdf; Bruner, J.S., Postman, L., On the perception of incongruity: A paradigm (1949) Journal of Personality, 18, pp. 206-223; Cha, E.-S., Kim, K.H., Erlen, J., Translation of scales in cross-cultural research: Issues and techniques (2007) Journal of Advanced Nursing, 58, pp. 386-395; Clark, L.A., Watson, D., Constructing validity: Basic issues in objective scale development (1995) Psychological Assessment, 7, pp. 309-319; Cronbach, L.J., Meehl, P.E., Construct validity in psychological tests (1955) Psychological Bulletin, 52, pp. 281-302; DeVellis, R.F., (2003) Scale Development: Theory and Applications, , 2nd ed Thousand Oaks CA: Sage; Draper, J.V., Kaber, D.B., Usher, J.M., (1998) Telepresence.

For example, the semantic content of lyrics seems to cause associated short-Term effects regarding cognition and affect. However, we argue that these effects might have been confounded by other musical parameters related to time, pitch, texture, or voice of the selected songs. This study overcame this methodological problem by using different versions of an experimentally manipulated song. In a 2 × 2 between-subjects design, 120 university students listened to four versions of a song with violent or prosocial lyrics presented in slow or fast tempo. As predicted by theories of priming, violent lyrics increased aggressive cognitions (word completion test) and aggressive affect (self-reported state anger) in comparison with prosocial lyrics. However, the reverse effects of prosocial lyrics on prosocial cognitions and prosocial affect could not be confirmed. Finally, the tempo of the song did not consistently increase selfreported arousal, and we did not find more extreme effects under conditions of fast tempo as predicted by the arousal-extremity model. © 2015 Hogrefe Publishing.",Affect; Aggression; Arousal; Cognition; Music,,,,,,,,,"Allen, M., Herrett-Skjellum, J., Jorgenson, J., Kramer, M.R., Ryan, D.J., Timmerman, L., Effects of music (2007) Mass Media Effects Research: Advances Through Meta-Analysis, pp. 263-279. , R.

While ideological groups have been of interest for decades, little empirical research has examined their online presence. The aims of this study were to compare nonviolent and violent ideological group websites with each other and with nonideological websites with respect to social categorization, moral disengagement, and website credibility, and to examine the relationships of psychological processes to website credibility. A content analysis approach was used to rate 105 websites (violent = 32, nonviolent = 36; nonideological = 37) for aspects of social categorization, outgrouping, moral disengagement, content features of credibility, and structural features of credibility. Violent ideological group websites manifest a greater degree of social categorization, outgrouping, and moral disengagement than nonviolent ideological and nonideological websites. Regression analysis shows that these three variables negatively predict content and structural website credibility for nonviolent ideological groups but do not significantly predict website credibility for violent groups or nonideological groups. Potential limitations include small sample, use of raters (vs. normative website visitors) to evaluate websites, inclusion of only English-language websites, limited number of psychological processes examined and the potential need for more specific website categories. Social identity processes on websites vary for different types of groups and impact perceived credibility of such groups in online environments. © 2015 Hogrefe Publishing.",Ideological groups; Ideological websites; Psychological processes; Social identity; Website credibility,,,,,,,,,"Aberson, C.L., Healy, M., Romero, V., Ingroup bias and self-esteem: A meta-Analysis (2000) Personality and Social Psychology Review, 4 (2), pp. 157-173; Akins, J.K., The Ku Klux Klan: America's forgotten terrorists (2006) Law Enforcement Executive Forum, 5, pp. 127-144; Alexander, J.E., Tate, M.A., (1999) Web Wisdom: How to Evaluate and Create Information Quality on the Web, , New York Routledge; Angie, A.D., Davis, J.L., Allen, M.T., Byrne, C.L., Ruark, G., Cunningham, C.B., Mumford, M.D., Studying ideological groups online: Identification and assessment of risk factors for violence (2011) Journal of Applied Social Psychology, 41, pp. 627-657; Ashmore, R.D., Deaux, K., McLaughlin-Volpe, T., An organizing framework for collective identity: Articulation and significance of multidimensionality (2004) Psychological Bulletin, 130 (1), pp. 80-114; Bandura, A., Human agency in social cognitive theory (1989) American Psychologist, 44 (9), pp. 1175-1184; Bandura, A., Moral disengagement in the perpetration of inhumanities (1999) Personality and Social Psychology Review, 3 (3), pp. 193-209; Bernardin, H.J., Buckley, M.R., Strategies in rater training (1981) Academy of Management Review, 6 (2), pp. 205-212; Bobo, L., Whites' opposition to busing Symbolic racism or realistic group conflict?

The value that study participants placed on the unique features of computer-mediated communication (CMC; i.e., reduced nonverbal cues and enhanced message control) was associated with greater feelings of disinhibition, which in turn predicted higher levels of preference for online social interactions (POSI). POSI was found to be associated with negative outcomes due to Internet use. Variables accounted for 28% of the variance in participants' online disinhibition, 27% of the variance in POSI, and 30% of the variance in the negative outcomes. The study represents a step toward a better understanding of the psychological mechanisms underlying the link between CMC characteristics and PIU. © 2015 Hogrefe Publishing.",Computer-mediated communication; Internet attributes; Online disinhibition; Preference for online social interaction; Problematic Internet use,,,,,,,,,"Anthenunis, M.L., Valkenburg, P.M., Peter, J., The quality of online, offline, and mixed-mode friendships among users of a social networking site.

To advance our understanding and contribute to possible solutions, the present two-wave field study investigated the role of TV consumption in the emergence and maintenance of Islamophobia in a weighted sample of non-Muslim Germans (N = 97; aged 14-33 years). Past research has indicated a negative bias in Islam-related news coverage, which is especially extreme on German private TV channels. The present study investigated the relationship between TV consumption and Islamophobia using Slater's theory of reinforcing spirals of media selectivity and effects (Slater, 2007, Communication Theory, 17, 281-303). It sought to investigate the validity of and to refine Slater's theory. Thus, TV consumption was differentiated between quantity and quality (divided between preference for public channels ARD/ZDF and private channels RTL/Sat.1). We hypothesized (a) a significant crosssectional relationship of quantity and quality of TV consumption (preference for public/private channels) to the Islamophobia level, and (b) a mutual reinforcement of quantity/quality of TV consumption and Islamophobia over time. Results of step-wise linear regressions showed significant relations of private channel preference to levels of Islamophobia (cross-sectional) and a mutually reinforcing spiral process between the private channel preference and Islamophobia over time. The results emphasize (a) the importance of a specification of the construct of media use central to Slater's theory and (b) the need for an improvement of the Islam-related news coverage to decrease Islamophobia in Germany. © 2015 Hogrefe Publishing.",Islamophobia; Media use; Spirals of effect and selectivity; TV channels; TV consumption,,,,,,,,,"Adler, M., Knuth, I., Neumüller, G., (2012) Navigator Mediennutzung 2012 [Navigator Media Use 2012], SevenOne Media GmbH, , https://www.sevenonemedia.de/c/document_library/get_file?uuid=2a6db46d-ed67-4961-A31f-722360028543&groupId=10143, Retrieved from; Allport, G.W., (1954) The Nature of Prejudice, , Reading, MA: Addison-Wesley; Bleich, E., What is Islamophobia and how much is there?

While stereotypical associations may become automatically activated (implicit stereotypes), individuals can reject these thoughts and decide not to use them for an overtly expressed judgment (explicit stereotypes).We hypothesized that even if citizens negated stereotypical content, advertisements might still affect implicit stereotypes. This hypothesis was tested using an experiment where participants (N = 186) were exposed to zero, two, four, or six stereotypical advertisements. The results showed that stereotypical advertisements did not influence explicit stereotypes but did influence implicit stereotypes, even in critical recipients who negated the stereotypical content. © 2015 Hogrefe Publishing.",Dose-response; Implicit stereotypes; Negation; Political advertising; Right-wing populism,,,,,,,,,"Akalis, S., Banaji, M., Kosslyn, S., Crime alert!

In an experiment (N = 336), three different disclosure messages were compared with a no-disclosure condition. The results show that more explicit disclosure messages negatively affect transportation and identification and stimulate the generation of counterarguments. In addition, the more explicit disclosure messages affect both attitude measures via two of these processes (i.e., transportation and counterarguing). Less explicit disclosure messages do not have this effect.

In previous work, we have addressed this trend from a methodological perspective. In this paper, we outline the progression of scholarship in systematic investigations of mass communication phenomena over the past century, from behaviorism and environmental determinism to biological and evolutionary paradigms. These new paradigms are grounded in an emergentist perspective on the nature of psychological processes. We discuss what it means to ask valid research questions in media neuroscience studies and provide recent examples in the areas of interpersonal and intergroup processes, morality, and narratives as well as in persuasion and health communication. We conclude with a selection of innovative methodological avenues that have the potential to accelerate the integration of cognitive neuroscience into media psychology research. © 2015 Hogrefe Publishing.",Brain imaging; Cognitive neuroscience; Communication; Media neuroscience; Media psychology; Theory,,,,,,,,,"Afifi, T., Floyd, K., Communication, biology, and physiology: An introduction to the special issue (2014) Communication Monographs, 82 (1), pp. 1-3; Amodio, D.M., The neuroscience of prejudice and stereotyping (2014) Nature Reviews Neuroscience, 15, pp. 670-682; Anderson, D.R., Bryant, J., Murray, J.P., Rich, M., Rivkin, M.J., Zillmann, D., Brain imaging: A new approach to studying media processes and effects (2006) Media Psychology, 8, pp. 1-6; Anderson, J.A., Communication theory (1996) Epistemological Foundations, , New York: Guilford Press; Anderson, J.A., Baym, G., Philosophies and philosophic issues in communication, 1995-2004 (2004) Journal of Communication, 54, pp. 589-615; Babiloni, F., Astolfi, L., Social neuroscience and hyperscanning techniques: Past, present and future (2014) Neuroscience and Biobehavioral Reviews, 44, pp. 76-93; Bandura, A., Social cognitive theory of mass communication (2001) Media Psychology, 3 (3), pp. 265-299; Bassett, D.S., Gazzaniga, M.S., Understanding complexity in the human brain (2011) Trends in Cognitive Sciences, 15 (5), pp. 200-209; Berkman, E.T., Falk, E.B., Beyond brain mapping: Using the brain to predict real-world outcomes (2013) Current Directions in Psychological Science, 22 (1), pp. 45-55; Bickart, K.C., Wright, C.I., Dautoff, R.J., Dickerson, B.C., Feldman-Barrett, L., Amygdala volume and social network size in humans (2011) Nature Neuroscience, 14 (2), pp. 163-164; Bilek, E., Ruf, M., Schäfer, A., Akdeniz, C., Calhoun, V.D., Schmahl, C., Meyer-Lindenberg, A., Information flow between interacting human brains: Identification, validation, and relationship to social expertise (2015) Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 112 (16), pp. 5207-5212; Broad, C.D., (1925) The Mind and its Place in Nature, , New York: Harcourt, Brace; Bryant, J., Pribanic-Smith, E.J., A historical overview of research in communication science (2010) The Handbook of Communication Science, pp. 21-36. , C.

In addition to self-report ratings, physiological measurements, including electroencephalography (EEG), facial electromyography (EMG), and electrodermal activity (EDA), were obtained continuously. Self-reported pleasure and willingness to use products/services, relative left frontal EEG activation (i.e., approach motivation), and EDA were higher for good-reputation companies compared with bad-reputation companies. The findings show that corporate reputation affects emotional and motivational processes and that the emotional tone of messages and reader comments in online news affects reputation formation. © 2015 Hogrefe Publishing.",Digital publicity; Emotions; Neurophysiology; Organizational communication; Public relations; Reputation,,,,,,,,,"Allen, J.J.B., Coan, J.A., Nazarian, M., Issues and assumptions on the road from raw signals to metrics of frontal EEG asymmetry in emotion (2004) Biological Psychology, 67, pp. 183-218; Aula, P., Mantere, S., (2008) Strategic Reputation Management: Towards a Company of Good, , New York: Routledge; Bechara, A., Damasio, A., The somatic marker hypothesis: A neural theory of economic decision (2005) Games and Economic Behavior, 52, pp. 336-372; Bizer, G.Y., Petty, R.E., How we conceptualize our attitudes matters: The effects of valence framing on the resistance of political attitudes (2005) Political Psychology, 26, pp. 553-568; Boyd, B., Bergh, D., Ketchen, D., Jr., Reconsidering the reputation performance relationship (2010) Journal of Management, 36, pp. 588-609; Bromley, D.B., Psychological aspects of corporate identity, image and reputation (2000) Corporate Reputation Review, 3, pp. 240-252; Brown, T.J., Dacin, P.A., Pratt, M.G., Whetten, D.A., Identity, intended image, construed image, and reputation: An interdisciplinary framework and suggested terminology (2006) Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science, 34, pp. 99-106; Buzsáki, G., (2006) Rhythms of the Brain, , New York: Oxford University Press; Cacioppo, J.T., Gardner, W.L., Berntson, G.G., The affect system has parallel and integrative processing components: Form follows function (1999) Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 76, pp. 839-855; Cacioppo, J.T., Petty, R.E., Attitudes and cognitive response: An electrophysiological approach (1979) Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 37, pp. 2181-2199; Castells, M., (2009) Communication Power, , Oxford: Oxford University Press; Chun, R., Corporate reputation: Meaning and measurement (2005) International Journal of Management Reviews, 7, pp. 91-109; Coan, J.A., Allen, J.J.B., Frontal EEG asymmetry as a moderator and mediator of emotion (2004) Biological Psychology, 67, pp. 7-50; Damasio, A.R., William James and the modern neurobiology of emotion (2004) Emotion, Evolution, and Rationality, pp. 3-14. , D.

Seventh St., Bloomington, IN  47405, United States","Increased interaction with characters in games and online necessitates a better understanding of how different characteristics of these agents impact media users. This paper investigates a possible neurological underpinning for a common research finding - namely, that animated characters designed to be comparatively more human, more real, and more similar to the people they represent elicit more positive self-reported evaluations. The goal of this study was to examine the extent to which these results might be due to differential processing of character features in brain networks recruited for face recognition. There is some evidence that parts of the face network may be specifically tuned for real human faces. An experiment was conducted where participants viewed photographs of faces of actual agents (humans and animals) or colored drawings of matched agents (cartoon humans and animals). Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to measure blood oxygen-level dependent (BOLD) activation in the whole brain and specifically in the face network, we investigated the variation in patterns of activation with human and animal faces that were more or less real. The results were consistent with previous reports that the core regions of the face network are sensitive to the humanness of faces. However, our results extended previous work by showing that regions of the core and extended regions of the face network - and some regions outside the network - were sensitive to realism, but only realism of human faces. © 2015 Hogrefe Publishing.",Amygdala; Facial realism; FRMRI; Fusiform gyrus,,,,,,"Indiana University, IU",,,"Bailenson, J.N., Swinth, K.R., Hoyt, C.L., Persky, S., Dimov, A., Blascovich, J., The independent and interactive effects of embodied agent appearance and behavior on self-report, cognitive, and behavioral markers of copresense in immersive virtual environments (2005) PRESENCE: Teleoperators and Virtual Environments, 14, pp. 379-393; Betts, L.R., Wilson, H.R., Heterogeneous structure in face-selective human occipito-temporal cortex (2010) Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience, 22, pp. 2276-2288; Bradley, M.M., Cuthbert, B.N., Lang, P.J., Picture media and emotion: Effects of a sustained affective context (1996) Psychophysiology, 33, pp. 662-670; Brainard, D.H., The psychophysics toolbox (1997) Spatial Vision, 10, pp. 433-436; Buccino, G., Lui, F., Canessa, N., Patteri, I., Lagravinese, G., Benuzzi, F., Rizzolatti, G., Neural circuits involved in the recognition of actions performed by nonconspecifics: An FMRI study (2004) Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience, 16 (1), pp. 114-126; Chaminade, T., Hodgins, J., Kawato, M., Anthropomorphism influences perception of computer-actions (2007) Social Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience, 2 (3), pp. 206-216; Chaminade, T., Zecca, M., Blakemore, S.J., Takanishi, A., Frith, C.D., Micera, S., Umiltà, M.A., Brain response to a humanoid robot in areas implicated in the perception of human emotional gestures (2010) PloS ONE, 5 (7), p. e11577; Dyck, M., Winbeck, M., Leiberg, S., Chen, Y., Gur, R.C., Recognition profile of emotions in natural and virtual faces (2008) PLoS ONE, 3 (11), p. e3628; Fox, C.J., Iaria, G., Barton, J.J.S., Defining the face processing network: Optimization of the functional localizer in fMRI (2009) Human Brain Mapping, 30, pp. 1637-1651; Guadagno, R.E., Blascovich, J., Bailenson, J.N., McCall, C., Virtual humans and persuasion: The effects of agency and behavioral realism (2007) Media Psychology, 10 (1), pp. 1-22; Haxby, J.V., Hoffman, E.A., Gobbini, M.I., The distributed human neural system for face perception (2000) Trends in Cognitive Sciences, 4 (6), pp. 223-233; Ishai, A., Let's face it: It's a cortical network (2008) Neuroimage, 40 (2), pp. 415-419; James, T.W., Huh, E., Kim, S., Temporal and spatial integration of face, object, and scene features in occipitotemporal cortex (2010) Brain and Cognition, 74 (2), pp. 112-122; Kanwisher, N., McDermott, J., Chun, M.M., The fusiform face area: A module in human extrastriate cortex specialized for face perception (1997) Journal of Neuroscience, 17, pp. 4302-4311; Kanwisher, N., Stanley, D., Harris, A., The fusiform face area is selective for faces not animals (1999) Neuroreport, 10 (1), pp. 183-187; Lewis, M.L., Weber, R., Bowman, N.D., ""They may be pixels, buy they're MY pixels"": Developing a metric of character attachment in role-playing video games (2008) Cyberpsychology and Behavior, 11, pp. 515-518; MacDorman, K.F., Green, R.D., Ho, C.-C., Koch, C.T., Too real for comfort?

To explain this phenomenon, two competing hypotheses were posed: the motivational decay hypothesis and the consolidation interference hypothesis. Physiological, behavioral, and self-reported data were used to test the predictions. The results demonstrated higher levels of physiological arousal and higher levels of physiological and self-reported positivity and negativity when processing advertisements preceded by arousing positive and negative movie clips. The heart rate data showed that the appetitive motivational system facilitated higher cognitive effort (slower heart rate), and the aversive motivational system facilitated lower cognitive effort (faster heart rate). The state of cognitive overload was reached during the first 10 s of the ads following negative arousing clips, while during ads following positive arousing clips, the cognitive system functioned at the maximum of its capacity. Overall, the results are more supportive of the consolidation interference hypothesis. © 2015 Hogrefe Publishing.",Consolidation; Emotion spillover effect; Memory; Motivated information processing,,,,,,,,,"Abercrombie, H.C., Speck, N.S., Monticelli, R.M., Endogenous cortisol elevations are related to memory facilitation only in individuals who are emotionally aroused (2006) Psychoneuroendocrinology, 31 (2), pp. 187-196; Andreano, J.M., Cahill, L., Glucocorticoid release and memory consolidation in men and women (2006) Psychological Science, 17 (6), pp. 466-470; Baddeley, A.D., Implications of neuropsychological evidence for theories of normal memory (1982) Philosophical Transactions: Biological Sciences, 298, pp. 59-72; Benjamini, Y., Hochberg, Y., Controlling the false discovery rate -A new and powerful approach to multiple testing (1995) Journal of the Royal Statistical Society B, 57, pp. 289-300; Bradley, M.M., Codispoti, M., Cuthbert, B.N., Lang, P.J., Emotion and motivation I: Defensive and appetitive reactions in picture processing (2001) Emotion, 1 (3), pp. 276-298; Bradley, M.M., Lang, P.J., Measuring emotion: The self-assessment manikin and the semantic differential (1994) Journal of Behavior Therapy and Experimental Psychiatry, 25 (1), pp. 49-59; Buchanan, T.W., Lovallo, W.R., Enhanced memory for emotional material following stress-level cortisol treatment in humans (2001) Psychoneuroendocrinology, 26 (3), pp. 307-317; Bushman, B.J., Effects of television violence on memory for commercial messages (1998) Journal of Experimental Psychology: Applied, 4 (4), pp. 291-307; Bushman, B.J., Does venting anger feed or extinguish the flame?

In particular, we examined activity in subregions of the medial prefrontal cortex linked to self- and value-related processing, to test whether these neurocognitive processes play a role in message-consistent behavior change. We observed significant relationships between activity in both brain regions of interest and behavior change (such that higher activity predicted a larger reduction in smoking). Furthermore, activity in these brain regions predicted variance independent of traditional, theory-driven self-report metrics such as intention, self-efficacy, and risk perceptions. We propose that valuation is an additional cognitive process that should be investigated further as we search for a mechanistic explanation of the relationship between brain activity and media effects relevant to health behavior change. © 2015 Hogrefe Publishing.",Behavior change; Brain-as-predictor; Cognitive neuroscience; Neuroimaging; Smoking,,,,,,"National Institutes of Health, NIH",,,"Ajzen, I., From intentions to actions: A theory of planned behavior (1985) Action-control: From Cognition to Behavior, pp. 11-39. , J.

The current study investigated whether context congruency was able to increase the banner's impact. Our study tested context congruencies (pictures or text elements or both) and their impact on awareness, retention, and attitude toward an advertisement. We used eye tracking to account for effects on visual attention relative to contact time and further information processing.

Results showed that older and younger adults had similar arousal responses but different patterns of attention and memory. Older adults paid more attention to all messages than did younger adults. However, this attention did not translate into greater memory. Older and younger adults had similar levels of memory for slow-paced messages, but younger adults outperformed older adults significantly as pacing increased, and the difference was larger for arousing compared with calm messages. The differences found are in line with predictions made based on the cognitive-aging literature. © 2014 Hogrefe Publishing.",Age; LC4MP; Message processing; Pacing; Television,,,,,,,,,"Baron, A., Le Breck, D.B., Are older adults generally more conservative?

Two recent discoveries have contributed to a more thorough understanding of the role of news stereotypes in the perception of facial threat: First, social-cognition research has revealed that automatically activated stereotypes influence the perception of facial threat. Individuals holding hostile stereotypes toward dark-skinned outgroup members perceive ambiguous dark-skinned faces as more hostile than similar light-skinned faces. Second, media-stereotyping research has found that the media can influence individuals' automatically activated stereotypes. Combining these two findings, it was hypothesized that reading tabloid articles about crimes committed by dark-skinned offenders would increase the perceived facial threat of meeting dark-skinned strangers in a subsequent situation. This hypothesis was tested in a laboratory experiment. Participants read crime articles where cues indicating (dark) skin color were mentioned or not. The results showed that reading about dark-skinned criminals increases the perceived facial threat of dark-skinned strangers compared with light-skinned strangers. © 2014 Hogrefe Publishing.",Dark-skinned; Ethnic; Facial threat; Media stereotypes; Newspapers,,,,,,,,,"Abraham, L., Appiah, O., Framing news stories: The role of visual imagery in priming racial stereotypes (2006) Howard Journal of Communications, 17, pp. 183-203; Akalis, S., Banaji, M., Kosslyn, S., Crime alert!

However, not much is known about age differences in the use of different regulation strategies during a highly distressing film scene that evokes strong negative emotions of anger and sadness. Therefore, we examined age differences in four situation-specific emotion regulation strategies - namely, rumination, distraction, suppression, and mediality (a form of media-specific reappraisal). A sample of 99 older and 108 younger participants reported their current emotional state, then watched a highly distressing film scene, and finally reported their emotional reactions to the scene and the emotion regulation strategies they used. The manipulation check indicated that the film was successful in eliciting strong negative emotions of sadness and anger. Furthermore, after securing measurement invariance, we found that older adults reported higher scores in mediality and suppression than younger adults. No differences were found concerning distraction and rumination. Results are discussed in the light of theoretical considerations. © 2015 Hogrefe Publishing.",Age differences; Distressing film scene; Emotion regulation strategies; Measurement invariance,,,,,,,,,"Bartsch, A., As time goes by: What changes and what remains the same in entertainment experience over the life span?

This study explored how network autocorrelation, via informal communication within a virtual group, affected an individual's task achievement in the online game World of Warcraft. Informal interactions between guild members during a 4-year period were collected and analyzed to assess how informal interactions with other group members affected an individual's in-game achievement. Findings indicate informal communication from other group members (specifically the experience and helpfulness of the other members) positively predict an individual's task performance, while tenure with the group negatively predict individual achievement.

The present study investigated the effects of exposure to sexual objectification of female artists in music videos, on female emerging adults' self-objectification and their ability to cognitively process subsequent television commercials. Results indicated that exposure to music videos high in sexual objectification induced self-objectification and hindered participants' subsequent performance in encoding visual information from commercials, but did not diminish participants' ability to allocate resources to, or to recall factual information from, the commercials. © 2014 Hogrefe Publishing.",Advertising; Cognitive processing; Music videos; Sexual objectification,,,,,,"University of Missouri, MU",,,"Arnett, J.J., Emerging adulthood: A theory of development from the late teens through the twenties (2000) American Psychologist, 55 (5), pp. 469-480; Aubrey, J.S., Effects of sexually objectifying media on self-objectification and body surveillance in undergraduates: Results of a 2-year panel study (2006) Journal of Communication, 56, pp. 366-386; Aubrey, J.S., Frisby, C., Sexual objectification in music videos: A content analysis comparing gender and genre (2011) Mass Communication and Society, 14, pp. 475-501; Aubrey, J.S., Henson, J.R., Hopper, K.M., Smith, S.E., A picture is worth twenty words (about the self): Testing the priming influence of visual sexual objectification on women's self-objectification (2009) Communication Research Reports, 26, pp. 271-284; Aubrey, J.S., Hopper, M., Mbure, W., Check that body! the effects of sexually objectifying music videos on college men's sexual beliefs (2011) Journal of Broadcasting and Electronic Media, 55, pp. 360-379; Bartky, S.L., (1990) Femininity and Domination: Studies in the Phenomenology of Oppression, , New York: Routledge; Basil, M., Secondary-reaction time measures (1994) Measuring Psychological Responses to Media, pp. 85-98. , A.

This study sought to examine the processes and conditions for effects of interactivity on processing online health news containing graphically displayed data. An experiment (N = 86) was conducted using online health news to examine these effects and test two previously proposed mechanisms - namely, those of increased involvement and perceived interactivity. Interactivity of information graphics accompanying an online health article was manipulated across three ordinal levels, and effects on postexposure attitudes and memory measures obtained. Preexisting level of involvement with the content domain and numerical aptitude were measured and tested as potential moderators of effects. The results showed that involvement with the content domain moderated the role of interactivity, such that increased interactivity led to more favorable attitudes toward the article for users low in involvement, while no effect was found for highly involved users. The effects of interactivity on attitudes were also found to be mediated by perceived interactivity. The results suggest that involvement with content domain is a key determinant of the effects of interactivity, and should be included as a key element in the development of theories of the impact of technology on communication. © 2014 Hogrefe Publishing.",Attitudes; Interactive graphics; Interactivity; Involvement; Online news,,,,,,,,,"Ahern, R.K., Stromer-Galley, J., The interaction effect: An experimental study of high and low interactivity political websites (2000) 50th Annual Conference of the International Communication Association, , June, Acapulco, Mexico; Ancker, J.S., Chan, C., Kukafka, R., Interactive graphics for expressing health risks: Development and qualitative evaluation (2009) Journal of Health Communication, 14, pp. 461-475; Ariely, D., Controlling the information flow: Effects on consumers' decision making and preferences (2000) Journal of Consumer Research, 27 (2), pp. 233-248; Bucy, E.P., Tao, C., The mediated moderation model of interactivity (2007) Media Psychology, 9, pp. 647-672; Cacioppo, J.T., Petty, R.E., Morris, K.J., Effects of need for cognition on message evaluation, recall, and persuasion (1983) Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 45 (4), p. 805; Calogero, M., Nelson, T.O., Utilization of base-rate information during feeling-of-knowing judgments (1992) The American Journal of Psychology, pp. 565-573; Celsi, R.L., Olson, J.C., The role of involvement in attention and comprehension processes (1988) Journal of Consumer Research, 15 (2), pp. 210-224; Donelle, L., Hoffman-Goetz, L., Gatobu, S., Arocha, J.F., Comprehension of internet-based numeric cancer information by older adults (2009) Informatics for Health and Social Care, 34 (4), pp. 209-224; George-Palilonis, J., Spillman, M., Interactive graphics development: A framework for studying innovative visual story forms (2011) Visual Communication Quarterly, 18 (3), pp. 167-177; Gray, J., Chambers, L., Bounegru, L., (2012) The Data Journalism Handbook, , Sebastopol, CA: O'Reilly; Hayes, A.F., (2012) PROCESS: A Versatile Computational Tool for Observed Variable Mediation, Moderation, and Conditional Process Modeling, , http://www.afhayes.com/public/process2012.pdf, White paper; Jee, J., Lee, W.N., Antecedents and consequences of perceived interactivity: An exploratory study (2002) Journal of Interactive Advertising, 3 (1), pp. 34-45; Jiang, Z., Chan, J., Tan, B.C., Chua, W.S., Effects of interactivity on website involvement and purchase intention (2010) Journal of the Association for Information Systems, 11 (1), pp. 34-59; Johnson, B.T., Eagly, A.H., Effects of involvement on persuasion: A meta-analysis (1989) Psychological Bulletin, 106 (2), p. 290; Johnson, E.J., Tversky, A., Affect, generalization, and the perception of risk (1983) Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 45 (1), pp. 20-31; Johnson, P.O., Fay, L.C., The johnson-neyman technique, its theory and application (1950) Psychometrika, 15 (4), pp. 349-367; Kristof, R., Satran, A., (1995) Interactivity by Design, , Mountain View, CA: Adobe Press; Larsson, A.O., Interactivity on swedish newspaper websites: What kind, how much and why?

Sellers and buyers in online auctions navigate this challenge by displaying and evaluating various cues, a critical one being use of photographs. Warranting theory predicts that cues less subject to control and manipulation by the presenter will be more influential in impression formation. Therefore, user-generated photographs which display the actual item should be more effective in generating successful auctions, more bidders, more bids, and higher prices, compared with stock photographs. A field experiment tested this prediction by systematically manipulating photographs for eBay auctions. User-generated photographs were found to have a positive effect on likelihood of selling and the number of auction bidders. Findings indicate that attracting more bidders is a possible mechanism for higher sale prices and also show a moderating role of bidder experience. © 2014 Hogrefe Publishing.",E-commerce; Field experiment; Online auction; Photographs; Signaling; Warranting,,,,,,,,,"Bente, G., Baptist, O., Leuschner, H., Tobuy or not to buy: Influence of seller photos and reputation on buyer trust and purchase behavior (2012) International Journal of Human-Computer Studies, 70, pp. 1-13; Berger, C.R., Calabrese, R.J., Some explorations in initial interaction and beyond: Toward a developmental theory of interpersonal communication (1975) Human Communication Research, 1, pp. 99-112; Bockstedt, J., Goh, K.H., Seller strategies for differentiation in highly competitive online auction markets (2012) Journal of Management Information Systems, 28 (3), pp. 235-267; Doleac, J., Stein, L., The visible hand: Race and online market outcomes (2010) Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research, , http://siepr.stanford.edu/publicationsprofile/2149; Donath, J., Signals in social supernets (2007) Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication, 13, pp. 231-251; Gibbs, J.L., Ellison, N.B., Lai, C.-H., First comes love, then comes Google: An investigation of uncertainty reduction strategies and self-disclosure in online dating (2011) Communication Research, 38, pp. 70-100; Gilkeson, J.H., Reynolds, K., Determinants of internet auction success and closing price: An exploratory study (2003) Psychology & Marketing, 20, pp. 537-566; Hayes, A.F., (2013) Introduction to Mediation, Moderation, and Conditional Process Analysis: A Regression-based Approach, , New York: Guilford Press; Hou, J., Kuzma, A., Kuzma, J., Winner's curse or adverse selection in online auctions: The role of quality uncertainty and information disclosure (2009) Journal of Electronic Commerce Research, 10, pp. 144-154; Houser, D., Wooders, J., Reputation in auctions: Theory, and evidence from eBay (2006) Journal of Economics & Management Strategy, 15, pp. 353-369; (2012) IDC - Press Release: As Traditional Web Site Adoption Slows, Facebook and other Social Networks Become Key Platforms for Home-based Business Promotional and Commercial Activity Online, According to IDC, , http://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=prUS23509012, Retrieved from; Kamins, M.A., Dreze, X., Folkes, V.S., Effects of seller-supplied prices on buyers' product evaluations: Reference prices in an internet auction context (2004) Journal of Consumer Research, 30, pp. 622-628; Kauffman, R.J., Wood, C.A., Doing their bidding: An empirical examination of factors that affect a buyer's utility in internet auctions (2006) Information Technology and Management, 7, pp. 171-190; LaRose, R., Eastin, M.S., Is online buying out of control?

Little attention has been paid to how in-game violence is actually perceived and evaluated. To investigate this issue we conducted two experimental studies (N = 30 and N = 74) in which participants either played or watched a violent shooter game and reported how they perceived and evaluated the violent content. Results showed that playing the games led to an increased awareness for in-game violence, but also to less-negative subjective evaluations of the violent content. Gaming frequency had a negative effect on both the perception and evaluation of in-game violence, suggesting a desensitization effect. The results of our studies illustrate that individual perceptions and evaluations of violence in digital games have to be taken into account when studying their effects. Implications for further research and the system of age ratings are discussed based on our findings.",Desensitization; Interactivity; Media violence; Tunnel vision; Video games,,,,,,,,,"Achtman, R.L., Green, C.S., Bavelier, D., Video games as a tool to train visual skills (2008) Restorative Neurology and Neuroscience, 26 (4-5), pp. 435-446; Adachi, P.J.C., Willoughby, T., The effect of violent video games on aggression: Is it more than just the violence?

Considering social identity theory and the Arab/Muslim/Middle Eastern terrorist stereotype, White participants were expected to correctly identify White European-looking men and misidentify Middle Eastern-looking men as the perpetrators in news stories. A 2 (race/ethnicity of the perpetrator: White European- or Middle Eastern-looking) × 2 (story type: violent or nonviolent) experiment revealed that correct recall of the perpetrator for Middle Eastern-looking men was lower than that of White European-looking men. However, White individuals were not significantly more likely to incorrectly recall Middle Eastern-looking men than White European-looking men as perpetrators. Regardless of condition, more negative attitudes toward Arabs and Muslims predicted the incorrect recall of both Middle Easternand White European-looking men as perpetrators. These results are explained in light of their contradiction of existing theory. Also, a new measure of attitudes toward Arabs and Muslims is recommended.",Criminality; Memory; News media; Social identity; Stereotypes,,,,,,,,,"Althaus, S.L., Kim, Y.M., Priming effects in complex information environments: Reassessing the impact of news discourse on presidential approval (2006) Journal of Politics, 68 (4), pp. 960-976; Blair, I., Chapleau, K.M., Judd, C.M., The use of afrocentric featur es as cues for judgment in the presence of diagnostic information (2005) European Journal of Social Psychology, 35 (1), pp. 59-68; Blair, I., Judd, C.M., Fallman, J.L., T he automaticity of race and afrocentric facial features in social judgments (2004) Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 87 (6), pp. 763-778; Brewer, M.B., Gardner, W., Who is this ""we""?

The current research showed that fantasy-seeking motivations combined with self-esteem to create either unregulated game play habits or an incentive to play a musical instrument in real life. We obtained measures from adult players of rhythm-based music video games (N = 421), regarding their gaming habits, fantasy-seeking motivations, and self-esteem. Regression analyses showed that the interaction of low self-esteem with high fantasy-seeking motivation predicted unregulated game play. Self-esteem was negatively related to habitual and solitary game play. Fantasyseeking motivations positively predicted a player's desire to learn or play a musical instrument in real life. These results suggest that fantasyseeking motivations reflect escapism under certain conditions and a desire to develop game-related skills in real life under other conditions. We discuss potential educational benefits of fantasy seeking and the implications for theory and scholarship regarding video game motivations.",Deficient self-regulation; Fantasy; Habit; Self-esteem; Video games,,,,,,,,,"Arsenault, D., Guitar hero: ""not like playing guitar at all""?

Despite this high level of use, less research has examined the interaction between adolescent development and use of social networking sites. Thus, the present study seeks to understand the relationship between adolescents' Facebook use and their experience of a developmental construct, Imaginary Audience. Using survey data collected from 260 participants between the ages of 9 and 26, results suggested a positive relationship between Facebook use and Imaginary Audience ideation. Furthermore, to better understand this relationship, behavioral rehearsal was tested as a mediating variable. Results were supportive of this mediator. The present study was limited in two main ways: First, given the cross-sectional survey design, we were unable to make causal claims from our data. Second, the sample was predominantly homogenous in nature. Despite these limitations, however, the implications of these findings are twofold: First, this research indicates that Facebook use is related to characteristics of adolescent development. Future research should continue to examine this relationship pattern. Second, by connecting the study of media behaviors and developmental theory, we call attention to a timely and fruitful avenue for the interdisciplinary study of developmental phenomena and media.",Adolescents; Development; Facebook; Imaginary audience; Social networking sites,,,,,,,,,"Antheunis, M.L., Schouten, A.P., The effects of other-generated and system generated cues on adolescents' perceived attractiveness on social networking sites (2011) Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication, 16 (3), pp. 391-406; Burke, M., Marlow, C., Lento, T., Feed me: Motivating newcomer contribution in social network sites (2009) Proceedings of the 27th Annual SIGCHI Confere Nce on Human Factors in Computing Systems, pp. 945-954. , New York ACM; Elkind, D., Egocentrism in adolescence (1967) Child Development, 38 (4), pp. 1025-1034; Fenigstein, A., Scheier, M.F., Buss, A.H., Public and private self-consciousness: Assessment and theory (1975) Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology, 43 (4), pp. 522-527; Fogg, B.J., Mass interpersonal persuasion: An early view of a new phenomenon (2008) Proceedings of the Third International Conference on Persuasive Technology, pp. 35-46. , In H.

In an experimental study involving college students (N = 121) playing a casual online tower defense game, we tested the relationship between difficulty and enjoyment and the possible mediating roles played by competency, as specified by self-determination theory, and challenge-skill balance, as specified by flow theory. Path analysis suggested that feelings of competency contribute to enjoyment by helping players obtain a balance between challenge and skill, and that competency is enhanced when players are assigned an easier game mode. This paper then addresses implications for theory, game design, and laboratory studies. © 2014 Hogrefe Publishing.",Difficulty; Digital games; Flow; Self-determination theory,,,,,,,,,"Abuhamdeh, S., Csikszentmihalyi, M., The importance of challenge for the enjoyment of intrinsically motivated, goal-directed activities (2012) Personality & Social Psychology Bulletin, 38, pp. 317-330. , doi: 10.1177/0146167211427147; Csikszentmihalyi, M., (1997) Finding Flow: The Psychology of Engagement with Everyday Life., , New York: BasicBooks; Deci, E., Ryan, R., The ''what'' and ''why'' of goal pursuits: Human needs and the self-determination of behavior (2000) Psychological Inquiry, 11, pp. 227-268. , doi: 10.1207/S15327965PLI1104-01; Hsu, S.H., Lee, F.-L., Wu, M.-C., Designing action games for appealing to buyers (2005) Cyberpsychology and Behavior, 8 (6), pp. 585-591. , DOI 10.1089/cpb.2005.8.585; Hu, L., Bentler, P.M., Cutoff criteria for fit indices in covariance structure analysis: Conventional criteria versus new alternatives (1999) Structural Equation Modeling: A Multidisciplinary Journal, 6, pp. 1-55. , doi: 10.1080/10705519909540118; Jackson, S.A., Marsh, H., Development and validation of a scale to measure optimal experience: The flow state scale (1996) Journal of Sport & Exercise Psychology, 18, pp. 17-35. , http://psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/1996-93766-93012; Jin, S.-A.A., Toward integrative models of flow'': Effects of performance, skill, challenge, playfulness, and presence on flow in video games (2012) Journal of Broadcasting & Electronic Media, 56, pp. 169-186. , doi: 10.1080/08838151.2012.678516; Juul, J., Fear of failing? the many meanings of difficulty in video games (2009) The Video Game Theory Reader 2, pp. 237-252. , M.

This study investigated the motives affecting social identification processes in the massive multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG) World of Warcraft (WoW). In this video game, players interact with other players in a tridimensional virtual world through their avatar.A sample of 92 WoW players took part in a data collection Web survey. Building on the theory of social identity, we tested the predictive power of three identification motives: self-esteem enhancement, optimal distinctiveness, and uncertainty reduction. Additionally, considering previous research on MMORPGs, we added identification with the game character and membership duration as further predictors of virtual group identification. The construct of virtual group identification was analyzed at two levels: identification with the faction and guild of the character. Furthermore, the current study was a first attempt to understand whether online identification may lead to group behavior such as evaluative ingroup bias.Our results indicated that traditional motivational theories of social identity were mostly confirmed. Moreover, identification with the avatar emerged as a strong predictor of group identity. Additionally, at both levels of analysis, group attachment led to an evaluative differentiation between the ingroup and outgroup. The findings are discussed in light of modern theories of social identity and media research. © 2014 Hogrefe Publishing.",MMORPGs; Social identity motives; Video games; Virtual communities,,,,,,,,,"Aberson, C.L., Healy, M., Romero, V., In-group bias and self-esteem: A meta-analysis (2000) Personality and Social Psychology Review, 4, pp. 157-173. , doi: 10.1207/S15327957PSPR0402-04; Abrams, D., Hogg, M.A., Comments on the motivational status of self-esteem in social identity and intergroup discrimination (1988) European Journal of Social Psychology, 18, pp. 317-334. , doi: 10.1002/ejsp.2420180403; Aron, A., Aron, E.N., Smollan, D., Inclusion of other in the self scale and the structure of interpersonal closeness (1992) Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 63, pp. 596-612. , doi: 10.1037/0022-3514.63.4.596; Ashmore, R.D., Deaux, K., McLaughlin-Volpe, T., An organizing framework for collective identity: Articulation and significance of multidimensionality (2004) Psychological Bulletin, 130 (1), pp. 80-114. , DOI 10.1037/0033-2909.130.1.80; Bagozzi, R.P., Dholakia, U.M., Pearo, L., Antecedents and consequences of online social interactions (2007) Media Psychology, 9, pp. 77-114. , doi: 10.1080/15213260709336804; Bailenson, J.N., Beall, A.C., Transformed social interaction: Exploring the digital plasticity of avatars (2006) Avatars at Work and Play: Collaboration and Interaction in Shared Virtual Environments, pp. 1-16. , R.

The present study integrated interpersonal and mass communication literature to theoretically inform the outcomes of mediated forms of self-disclosure between a viewer and character on television. Empirically testing the effects of two dimensions of disclosure - depth (low intimacy versus high intimacy) and mode (character-to-viewer versus character-to-character versus narrator-to-viewer) of information delivery - this research supported the prediction that a viewer's overall enjoyment of witnessing a character self-disclose personal information would be mediated by identification and transportation. The results suggest the meaningful role of ''character address'' in heightening audience engagement with both the character and narrative. Implications for the similarity of interpersonal and mediated relationships, effective entertainment formats, social reality perceptions, and online self-disclosure are discussed. © 2014 Hogrefe Publishing.",Enjoyment; Identification; Media entertainment; Self-disclosure; Transportation,,,,,,,,,"Afifi, W., Burgoon, J.K., We never talk about that'': A comparison of cross-sex friendships and dating relationships on uncertainty and topic avoidance (1998) Personal Relationships, 5, pp. 255-272; Alberts, J.K., Yoshimura, C.G., Rabby, M., Loschiavo, R., Mapping the topography of couples' daily conversation (2005) Journal of Social and Personal Relationships, 22 (3), pp. 299-322. , DOI 10.1177/0265407505050941; Altman, I., Taylor, D.A., (1973) Social Penetration: The Development of Interpersonal Relationships, , New York: Holt, Rinehart, and Winston; Andrejevic, M., The kinder, gentler gaze of Big Brother: Reality TV in the era of digital capitalism (2002) New Media & Society, 4, pp. 251-270; Arbuckle, J.L., (1996) Amos Users' Guide, Version 3.6, , Chicago, IL: SPSS; Archer, R.L., Berg, J.H., Disclosure reciprocity and its limits: A reactance analysis (1978) Journal of Experimental Social Psychology, 14, pp. 527-540; Aron, A., Melinat, E., Aron, E.N., Vallone, R.D., Bator, R.J., The experimental generation of interpersonal closeness: A procedure and some preliminary findings (1997) Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, 23, pp. 363-377; Aslama, M., Pantti, M., Talking alone: Reality TV, emotions and authenticity (2006) European Journal of Cultural Studies, 9 (2), pp. 167-184. , DOI 10.1177/1367549406063162; Baggaley, R., (1980) Psychology of the TV Image, , Westmead, UK: Gower; Bazarova, N.N., Public intimacy: Disclosure interpretation and social judgments on Facebook (2012) Journal of Communication, 62 (5), pp. 815-832; Bentler, P.M., Bonett, D.G., Significance tests and goodness of fit in the analysis of covariance structures (1980) Psychological Bulletin, 88, pp. 588-606; Berger, C.R., Uncertainty and information exchange in developing relationships (1988) Handbook of Personal Relationships: Theory, Research, and Interventions, pp. 239-256. , S.

The current evidence is mainly correlational, however. This study used an experimental approach to examine the assumed causal influence of being moved, on reflective thoughts. Participants were randomly assigned to see one of two versions of a short film that elicited different levels of feeling moved, while keeping the cognitive, propositional content constant. Feeling moved was conceptualized and operationalized as an affective state characterized by negative valence, moderate arousal, mixed affect, and by the labeling of the experience in terms of feeling moved. As expected, the more moving film version elicited more reflective thoughts, which in turn predicted individuals' overall positive experience of the film. The effect of the film stimulus on reflective thoughts was fully mediated by individuals' affective state. © 2014 Hogrefe Publishing.",Appreciation; Cognition; Elaboration; Emotion; Eudaimonic entertainment,,,,,,,,,"Appel, M., Richter, T., Persuasive effects of fictional narratives increase over time (2007) Media Psychology, 10, pp. 113-134. , doi: 10.1080/15213260701301194; Ross, W.D., (1931) Nicomachean Ethics, , Aristotle.

Emerging adults were surveyed, and the data were analyzed using correlations and hierarchical regression. While television viewing, video game playing, and music listening were positively correlated with verbal aggression, only (rap) music listening remained significant when demographic and other sociological influences were factored in. Overall, the hierarchical regression analysis found religiosity, parental and peer influence, quality of neighborhood, sex, and media usage (listening to rap music) to be significant contributors to verbal aggression among emerging adults. Male participants reported more verbally aggressive behavior than women, and African Americans reported more verbal aggression than White respondents. While media usage seems to play a significant, but relatively small role, other demographic and sociological factors such as gender, neighborhood, religion, peers, and parents appear to be major contributors in the development of verbal aggression among emerging adults. © 2014 Hogrefe Publishing.",Gender; Media usage; Socialization agents; Survey research; Verbal aggression,,,,,,,,,"Aber, J.L., Bennett, N.G., Conley, D.C., Li, J., The effects of poverty on child health and development (1997) Public Health, 18, pp. 463-483; Anderson, C.A., Berkowitz, L., Donnerstein, E., Huesmann, L., Johnson, J.D., Linz, D., Wartella, E., The influence of media violence on youth (2003) Psychological Science in the Public Interest, 4 (3), pp. 81-110; Anderson, C.A., Bushman, B.J., Effects of violent video games on aggressive behavior, aggressive cognition, aggressive affect, physiological arousal, and pro-social behavior: A meta-analytic review of the scientific literature (2001) Psychological Science, 12 (5), pp. 353-359; Anderson, C.A., Carnagey, N., Eubanks, J., Exposure to violent media: The effects of songs with violent lyrics on aggressive thoughts and feelings (2003) Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 84 (5), pp. 960-971; Anderson, C.A., Carnagey, N.L., Flanagan, M., Benjamin Jr., A.J., Eubanks, J., Valentine, J.C., Violent video games: Specific effects of violent content on aggressive thoughts and behavior (2004) Advances in Experimental Social Psychology, 36, pp. 199-249; Anderson, C.A., Dill, K.E., Video games and aggressive thoughts, feelings, and behavior in the laboratory and in life (2000) Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 78, pp. 772-790; Aneshensel, C.S., Sucoff, C.A., The neighborhood context of adolescent mental health (1996) Journal of Health and Social Behavior, 37 (4), pp. 293-310; Aquilino, W.S., Supple, A.J., Long-term effects of parenting practices during adolescence on well-being outcomes in young adulthood (2001) Journal of Family Issues, 22, pp. 289-308; Arnold, D.S., O'Leary, S.G., Wolff, L.S., Acker, M.M., The parenting scale: A measure of dysfunctional parenting in discipline situations (1993) Psychological Assessment, 5 (2), pp. 137-144; Atkin, C.K., Smith, S.W., Roberto, A.J., Fediuk, T., Wagner, T., Correlates of verbally aggressive communication in adolescents (2002) Journal of Applied Communication Research, 30 (3), pp. 251-268; Bandura, A., Self-efficacy: Toward a unifying theory of behavioral change (1977) Psychological Review, 84, pp. 191-215; Bandura, A., (1986) Social Foundations of Thought and Action: A Social Cognitive Theory, , Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice Hall; Barnow, S., Lucht, M., Freyberger, H., Correlates of aggressive and delinquent conduct problems in adolescence (2005) Aggressive Behavior, 1, pp. 24-40; Bartholow, B.D., Sestir, M.A., Davis, E.B., Correlates and consequences of exposure to video game violence: Hostile personality, empathy, and aggressive behavior (2005) Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, 31 (11), pp. 1573-1586; Berkowitz, L., (1993) Aggression: Its Causes, Consequences, and Control, , New York: McGraw-Hill; Binder, A., Constructing racial rhetoric: Media depictions of harm in heavy metal and rap music (1993) American Sociological Review, 58 (6), pp. 753-767; Bjorkqvist, K., Lagerspetz, K., Kaukiainen, A., Do girls manipulate and boys fight?

However, it remains unclear how the superordinate context of disability, which is frequently used by journalists to depict PWDs in the media - or other contexts (e.g., sports) - affect recipients' attitudes toward those PWDs portrayed in the media. Potential context effects were analyzed with the help of two experiments (between-subjects design). In Study 1, nondisabled participants (N = 97) were randomly assigned to four groups. The context was manipulated by subliminally (30 ms) exposing participants to different textual primes of disability, sports, politics, and no prime (control group). Participants subsequently evaluated a visually depicted PWD (arm amputation). In Study 2, nondisabled participants (N = 63) were randomly assigned to three groups, and they read an illustrated print article (the same picture as in Study 1 was used). The context was manipulated with the help of specific news cues (disability, sports, politics), while the rest of the article remained unchanged. In both studies, the context of disability significantly lowered participants' evaluations of the PWD. In contrast, sports - in both studies - had a systematically positive impact on participants' attitudes toward the PWD. Furthermore, the general acceptance of PWDs in society was perceived to be more positive with sports cues in Study 2. Implications for the media coverage of PWDs are discussed. © 2014 Hogrefe Publishing.",Attitudes; Categorical person perception; Disability; Media effects; News cues,,,,,,,,,"Barden, J., Maddux, W.W., Petty, R.E., Brewer, M.B., Contextual moderation of racial bias: The impact of social roles on controlled and automatically activated attitudes (2004) Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 87 (1), pp. 5-22; Bargh, J.A., Chartrand, T.L., The mind in the middle: A practical guide to priming and automaticity research (2000) Handbook of Research Methods in Social and Personality Psychology, pp. 253-285. , H.

This study explored the effects of user control on users' immersion and enjoyment of the movie trailers, moderated by the content type. We conducted a 2 (high user control versus low user control) × 2 (drama film trailer versus documentary film trailer) mixed-design factorial experiment. The results showed that the level of user control over movie trailer interfaces decreased users' immersion when the trailer had an element of traditional story structure, such as a drama film trailer. Participants in the high user control condition answered that they were less fascinated with, absorbed in, focused on, mentally involved with, and emotionally affected by the movie trailer than participants in the low user control condition only with the drama movie trailer. The negative effects of user control on the level of immersion for the drama trailer translated into users' enjoyment. The impact of user control over interfaces on immersion and enjoyment varies depending on the nature of the media content, which suggests a possible trade-off between the level of user control and entertainment outcomes. © 2014 Hogrefe Publishing.",Enjoyment; Immersion; Online movie trailers; User control,,,,,,,,,"Ariely, D., Controlling the information flow: Effects on consumers' decision making and preferences (2000) The Journal of Consumer Research, 27 (2), pp. 233-248. , doi: 10.1086/314322; Averill, J.R., Personal control over aversive stimuli and its relationship to stress (1973) Psychological Bulletin, 80, pp. 286-303. , doi: 10.1037/h0034845; Bilandzic, H., Busselle, R.W., Enjoyment of films as a function of narrative experience, perceived realism and transportability (2011) Communications, 36 (1), pp. 29-50. , doi: 10.1515/COMM.2011.002; Bowman, N.D., Tamborini, R., Task demand and mood repair: The intervention potential of computer games (2012) New Media & Society, 14 (8), pp. 1339-1357; Brown, E., Cairns, P., A grounded investigation of game immersion (2004) CHI'04 Extended Abstracts on Human Factors in Computing Systems, pp. 1297-1300. , April, E.

Employing a quasi-experimental method, the interplay between prevailing perceived threat from the economic crisis that started in 2008 and each of the two personality types when dealing with threat - repression and sensitization - was examined to predict online news selection behavior, as unobtrusively recorded. A significant interaction between perceived threat and sensitization tendency was obtained for both the selection of financial crisis-related news and avoidance of financial crisis-unrelated news. The implications of this exclusive pattern of online news selection behavior are discussed. © 2014 Hogrefe Publishing.",Economic crisis; Perceived threat; Repression; Selective exposure; Sensitization,,,,,,,,,"Aluja-Fabregat, A., Personality and curiosity about tv and films violence in adolescents (2000) Personality and Individual Differences, 29, pp. 379-392. , doi: 10.1016/S0191-8869(99)00200-00207; Atkin, C.K., Instrumental utilities and information seeking (1973) New Models for Communication Research, pp. 205-242. , P.

From the perspectives of cultivation theory and social learning theory, children's risk for injury may be influenced by a variety of sources, including media. Previous research suggests that many media sources, including television programs and popular movies, display risky behaviors and a general disregard for safety. The present study added to this literature by quantifying the extent to which a popular form of media, video games, displays injury events and appropriate utilization of safety gear. Research assistants coded trailers of the world's most popular video games across 13 different genres. Acceptable reliability estimates across assistants were obtained, and results revealed that many video games do not portray safety restraint devices, helmets, or other safety gear. Less than 3% of games show primary characters wearing safety restraint devices while they are driving a vehicle, and helmets are rarely displayed when characters ride bicycles or skateboards. Significant differences in the portrayal of injury events and safety gear usage emerged across Entertainment Software Rating Board ratings. Implications for the video game industry are discussed. © 2014 Hogrefe Publishing.",Helmet; Injury; Safety; Safety restraint; Video games,,,,,,,,,"Atkin, C.K., Television socialization and risky driving by teenagers (1989) Alcohol, Drugs, and Driving, (5), pp. 1-11; Bandura, A., (1969) Principles of Behavior Modification, , New York Holt, Rinehart & Winston; Barr, P., Noble, J., Biddle, R., Video game values: Human-computer interaction and games (2007) Interacting with Computers, 19, pp. 180-195. , doi: 10.1016/j.intcom.2006.08.008; Bronfenbrenner, U., Toward an experimental ecology of human development (1977) American Psychologist, 32, pp. 513-531. , doi: 10.1037/0003-066X.32.7.513; Bronfenbrenner, U., (1979) The Ecology of Human Development: Experiments by Nature and Design, , Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press; Brown Kirschman, K., Mayes, S., Perciful, M.S., Prevention of unintentional injury in children and adolescents (2009) Handbook of Pediatric Psychology, pp. 586-602. , New York: Guildford Press InM C.

Results showed no evidence of any correlation between BMI and relative time devoted to video game usage by type of game (active versus sedentary), nor any support for a correspondence between overall levels of time spent with video games and BMI. Yet, the data did point to a nonlinear association in which those who devoted more than 50% of the total time they spend with video games on sedentary games had a higher BMI than those who spent less than 50% of their video gaming time with sedentary games. Important gender differences also emerged in the adolescents' opinions of active versus sedentary games. © 2014 Hogrefe Publishing.",Adolescents; BMI; Gender; Video games,,,,,,,,,"Baranowski, T., Abdelsamad, D., Baranowski, J., O'connor, T.M., Thompson, D., Barnett, A., Chen, T.A., Impact of an active video game on healthy children's physical activity (2012) Pediatrics, 129 (3), pp. 636-642; Barnett, A., Cerin, E., Baranowski, T., Active video games for youth: A systematic review (2011) Journal of Physical Activity and Health, 8, pp. 724-737; Biddiss, E., Irwin, J., Active video games to promote physical activity in children and youth (2010) Archives of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, 164 (7), pp. 664-672; Brown, J.D., Childers, K., Bauman, K., Koch, G., The influence of new media and family structure on young adolescents' television and radio use (1990) Communication Research, 17, pp. 65-82; (2012) About BMI for Children and Teens, , http://www.cdc.gov/healthyweight/assessing/bmi/childrens_bmi/ about_childrens_bmi.html, Retrieved from Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; Chin Paw, A.M.J.M., Jacobs, W.M., Vaessen, E.P.G., Titze, S., Van Mechelen, W., The motivation of children to play an active video game (2008) Journal of Science and Medicine in Sport, 11 (2), pp. 163-166; Common Sense Media (2011) Time Spent with Media by Income, , http://www.commonsensemedia.org/sites/default/files/research/ zerotoeightfinal2011.pdf, Retrieved from; Daley, A.J., Can exergaming contribute to improving physical activity levels and health outcomes in children?

Although the message was kept identical, the context of the message was experimentally manipulated to represent either a viral user-generated video or a government-sponsored public service announcement. The data provided evidence of an indirect relationship between media context and persuasive efficacy mediated through subjective evaluations of the message and social identification with the message producers.

Different forms of online social information, such as user comments and likes, might foster the effectiveness of these communication channels. However, it is unclear whether these types of information affect people's perceptions and judgments of health issues. Combining exemplification theory with research into online social information, we conducted a 2.3.2 experiment to address this question. We presented our participants (N = 577) with a discussion of influenza vaccination on mock-up of a Facebook page and varied the direct social information (user comments) and additional indirect social information (comment likes and post likes) given, to assess the impact on individuals' perceptions of public behavior and risk, and on their personal attitudes and behavioral intentions. Our results showed that the participants relied on direct but not indirect social information when forming judgments. © 2014 Hogrefe Publishing.",Exemplification; Health communication; Social information; Social network sites,,,,,,,,,"Abroms, L.C., Lefebvre, R.C., Obama's wired campaign: Lessons for public health communication (2009) Journal of Health Communication, 14, pp. 415-423. , doi:10.1080/10810730903033000; Ajzen, I., (2005) Attitudes, Personality and Behavior, , New York: Open University Press; Ajzen, I., Fishbein, M., The influence of attitudes on behavior (2005) The Handbook of Attitudes, pp. 173-221. , Mahwah, NJ Erlbaum In D.

Data obtained from a content analysis of complete seasons of three successful medical programs - ER, House, and Grey's Anatomy (66 episodes altogether) - were used to compose a survey which asked a representative sample of US adults (N = 281) to estimate the frequency of health concerns that were identified in the content analysis. The results partly support the cultivation hypothesis in its Gerbnerian version because the total amount of time devoted to TV viewing was found to be related to overestimating the proportion of dramatic diagnoses (poisoning and injuries) and exaggerating the mortality rate of inpatients; however, no effect was noted for items concerning elderly inpatients, and no effect was found for viewing of medical dramas. Since the distribution of the items concerning elderly inpatients was prone to a ceiling effect, the results lent support to the idea that the cultivation effect is sometimes capped by a ceiling effect. © 2014 Hogrefe Publishing.",Ceiling effect; Cultivation; Genre; Medical drama; Television,,,,,,,,,"Austin, P.C., Brunner, L.J., Type i error inflation in the presence of a ceiling effect (2003) American Statistician, 57 (2), pp. 97-104. , doi: 10.1198/0003130031450; Bilandzic, H., The perception of distance in the cultivation process: A theoretical consideration of the relationship between television content, processing experience, and perceived distance (2006) Communication Theory, 16, pp. 333-355. , doi: 10.1111/j.1468-2885.2006.00273.x; Bilandzic, H., Rçssler, P., Life according to television: Implications of genre-specific cultivation effects: The gratification/cultivation model.

We hypothesized that the first subscale would cover self-perceived competence in seeking health information online, and the second subscale information appraisal of health information on the Internet. A cross-sectional survey among 18-year-old students (N = 327) using our translation of the eHEALS was conducted. A confirmatory factor analysis compared the 1-factor model based on Norman and Skinners' analyses with the a priori specified 2-factor model.

Previous research has neglected the complicated social context in which people now play video games. However, a growing body of literature suggests that playing violent video games cooperatively with others can attenuate their aggression- facilitating effects and increase prosocial behaviors between players. To better understand which types of social game play can foster helping behaviors between players and which players may be engaging in these helping behaviors during game play, the current study administered a survey to 252 students who self-identified as video game players. The results suggest that participants who reported playing cooperatively/competitively with other players were more likely to report engaging in helping behaviors during game play. Additionally, participants who reported being motivated to play specialized roles in group game play and have an altruistic personality were more likely to report engaging in helping behaviors during game play. © 2013 Hogrefe Publishing.",Helping behaviors; Social game play; Video games,,,,,,,,,"Anderson, C.A., Ihori, N., Bushman, B.J., Rothstein, H.R., Shibuya, A., Swing, E.L., Saleem, M., Violent video game effects on aggression, empathy, and prosocial behavior in Eastern and Western countries: A meta-analytic review (2010) Psychological Bulletin, 136, pp. 151-173; Anderson, S.E., Williams, L.J., Interpersonal, job, and individual factors related to helping processes at work (1996) Journal of Applied Psychology, 81, pp. 282-296; Batson, C.D., (1991) The Altruism Question: Toward a Socialpsychological Answer, , New York: Psychology Press; Batson, C.D., Altruism and prosocial behavior (1998) The Handbook of Social Psychology, 2, pp. 282-315. , D.

This study advances prior work by coding expressed emotional responses to messages (as opposed to directly manipulated emotions or forced responses), incorporating and controlling for central thoughts, including sadness (a particularly relevant response to tragic stories), and examining the mediating role of concern, between emotion and policy support. An experiment with a US national online adult panel had participants read one of 60 violent crime or accident news stories, each manipulated to mention or withhold alcohol's causal contribution. Multigroup structural equation models suggested that stories not mentioning alcohol had a direct effect on policy support via fear and central thoughts, unmediated by concern. When alcohol was mentioned, sadness and anger affected alcohol-control support through concern.

At least two strands of research can be identified that are crucial for the understanding of CSIC: From the learning perspective, rooted in cognitive and educational psychology, CSIC is analyzed with regard to its potential for promoting specific cognitive processes, and thus ultimately for improving learning. From the communication perspective, rooted in social psychology and communication science, CSIC is analyzed with regard to conditions that affect its effectiveness and efficiency. CSIC researchers face the challenge of integrating the two traditionally separate research strands and their distinct methodological frameworks. In turn, new methods and findings emerging from an integrative application of research methods are leading to new conceptual challenges regarding the causal mechanisms mediating between the interindividual and the intraindividual levels in CSIC. We provide examples of CSIC research that demonstrate successful methodological integration, and introduce open conceptual challenges. © 2013 Hogrefe Publishing.",Computer-mediated collaboration scripts; Computer-supported instructional communication; Instructional design; Research methods; Virtual learning environments,,,,,,,,,"Bachour, K., Kaplan, F., Dillenbourg, P., An interactive table for supporting participation balance in face-to-face collaborative learning (2010) Learning Technologies, IEEE Transactions on, 3 (3), pp. 203-213; Bailenson, J.N., Beall, A.C., Loomis, J., Blascovich, J., Turk, M., Transformed social interaction, augmented gaze, and social influence in immersive virtual environments (2005) Human Communication Research, 31 (4), pp. 511-537; Bente, G., Rüggenberg, S., Kramer, N.C., Eschenburg, F., Avatar-mediated networking: Increasing social presence and interpersonal trust in net-based collaborations (2008) Human Communication Research, 34 (2), pp. 287-318; Berthold, K., Eysink, T.H.S., Renkl, A., Assisting self-explanation prompts are more effective than open prompts when learning with multiple representations (2009) Instructional Science, 37, pp. 345-363; Berthold, K., Faulhaber, L., Guevara, T., Renkl, A., Training focused processing of explanations: How can transfer across domains be fostered?

First, an exploratory survey (N = 189) aims to identify the motivation. Results show that some participants had a strong interest in gaining political information by following such shows, while others simply watch them for entertainment purposes. Drawing on the concept of infotainment as well as on the elaboration likelihood model as a basis for entertainment and the feeling of being informed, four hypotheses are then tested in a 2 × 2 (focus on entertaining features versus focus on information × talk show containing a video clip versus talk show containing no video clip) experiment with 63 subjects. The results suggest that people felt better informed and were more entertained through political talk shows when watching them with a focus on entertaining features rather than with a focus on information. However, whether a talk show contained a video clip or not did not make any difference. The fact that a focus on entertaining features can induce a feeling of being informed reveals an interesting phenomenon, which is consistent with current developments in entertainment theory. © 2013 Hogrefe Publishing.",Entertainment; Experiment; Feeling of being informed; Political talk shows; Video clips,,,,,,,,,"Baum, M.A., Sex, lies, and war: How soft news brings foreign policy to the inattentive public (2002) American Political Science Review, 96, pp. 91-109; Baum, M.A., Soft news and political knowledge: Evidence of absence or absence of evidence?

Appreciation has been shown to be conceptually and empirically different from enjoyment, which is characterized as pleasure and fun. Drawing upon terror management theory, this research investigates first the influence of reminders of one's own death on appreciation and enjoyment of a meaningful film and second, the influence of the search for meaning in one's life on these outcomes. Results of an experimental study (N = 60) showed that mortality salience increased appreciation of a meaningful film, but only for those who rated highly for search for meaning in life. Concerning enjoyment, a reverse pattern was found: Participants who intensely search for meaning in their lives enjoyed the film when their own mortality had not been made salient before watching. Results are discussed in the light of theoretical considerations about entertainment experiences and meaning. © 2013 Hogrefe Publishing.",Appreciation; Enjoyment; Meaningful film; Mortality salience; Search for meaning in life,,,,,,,,,"Algoe, S.B., Haidt, J., Witnessing excellence in action: The 'other-praising' emotions of elevation, gratitude, and admiration (2009) Journal of Positive Psychology, 4, pp. 105-127. , doi:10.1080/17439760802650519; Arndt, J., Vess, M., Tales from existential oceans: Terror management theory and how the awareness of our mortality affects us all (2008) Social and Personality Psychology Compass, 2, pp. 909-928. , doi:10.1111/j.1751-9004.2008.00079.x; Baumeister, R.F., Vohs, K.D., The pursuit of meaningfulness in life (2002) Handbook of Positive Psychology, pp. 608-618. , C.

However, few studies investigated the causes of GA and could explain why video game playing as a widespread phenomenon leads to a comparatively small percentage of addicted players. Additionally, the existing longitudinal studies mainly consider psychological trait variables and neglect the possible explanatory value of predictors in socialization regarding media availability, media use, and family and everyday school life. In this paper, the results of a two-wave longitudinal study comprising a sample of students from Grades 4 to 9 (N = 406) are presented. The data show that 15-year-old video game addicts had already exhibited a number of specific risk factors at the age of 10. Students from single-parent families seem to be particularly at risk, as are students with low experienced school well-being and with a weaker social integration in class. The data also indicate that problematic use of video games in childhood increases the risk of GA in adolescence. Male students are especially vulnerable for developing GA. The results of this study are an important contribution to understanding risk factors for GA in adolescents, thereby laying the groundwork for effective prevention measures. © 2013 Hogrefe Publishing.",Computer game addiction; Extensive gaming; Extensive video game playing; Video game addiction; Video game overuse,,,,,,,,,"(2012) American Psychiatric Association Board of Trustees Approves DSM-5, , http://www.psych.org/advocacy-newsroom/news-releases, American Psychiatric Association; Baier, D., Rehbein, F., Video game addiction in adolescence (2009) Multilokalität und Vernetzung: Beiträge Zur Technikbasierten Gestaltung Jugendlicher Sozialräume, pp. 139-155. , C.

Research shows that subconscious reminders of death influence a range of behaviors associated with charitable giving and a bolstered sense of patriotism (Burke, Martens, & Faucher, 2010, Personality & Social Psychology Review, 14, 155-195). Terror management theory (TMT) explains this relationship by positing that subconscious mortality salience motivates individuals to embrace their cultural worldviews (e.g., engaging in volunteerism or politically oriented activities). Moreover, collectivistic, relative to individualistic, self-construals motivate individuals to serve others and meet group needs. In a first-known attempt to understand the relationship between TMT, self-construals, and civic engagement, a 2 (mortality salience: high or low)©2 (self-construal: individualistic or collectivistic) experiment (N = 124) revealed that counter to common findings, increased mortality salience was negatively related to civic engagement intentions. However, as predicted, collectivism was positively associated with such intentions. Results also indicated that mortality salience and self-construals may not interact to influence civic engagement. ©2013 Hogrefe Publishing.",Civic engagement; Experiment; Mortality salience; Self-construals; Terror management theory,,,,,,,,,"Aaker, J.L., Accessibility or diagnosticity?

Alongside genetic and biological factors that can explain some aspects of these phenomena and the psychological outcomes associated with them, researchers attributed an important role to social and cultural factors, including the mass media. This study examined the relationship between media exposure and early adolescents' body image. It applied social comparison theory to the study of favorite television characters, an original extension of past research on general social comparison processes. Specifically, the parasocial relationships and motivations for self-comparison with the characters were examined. Based on a survey among 391 seventh and eighth graders, the study found that media exposure negatively predicted body image both directly and through a mediation process involving parasocial relationships with favorite characters, motivations to self-compare, and engagement in social comparison with them. Further, social comparison with favorite characters was found to positively predict an actual/ideal body shape discrepancy which negatively predicted body image. The findings are discussed in light of theory, developmental considerations associated with this unique age group, past research, and educational and policy implications. © 2013 Hogrefe Publishing.",Adolescents; Body image; Media; Parasocial relationship; Social comparison,,,,,,,,,"Anton, S.D., Perri, M.G., Riley, J.R., Discrepnacy between actual and ideal body images impact on eating and exercise behaviors (2000) Eating Behaviors, 1, pp. 153-160. , PII s1471-015300 00015-00015; Bartlett, C.P., Harris, R.J., The impact of body emphasizing video games on body image concerns in men and women (2008) Sex Roles, 59, pp. 586-601. , doi: 10.1007/s11199- 008-9457-9458; Bessenoff, G.R., Can the media affect us?

In accordance with the feeling-as-information theory (Schwarz, 2012, In Van Lange et al. (Eds.), Handbook of Theories of Social Psychology, Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage), we assumed that political ads containing positive, calming stimuli (e.g., nature pictures) signal a benign environment and thus should lead to less-effortful processing in subsequent situations. Due to the fact that the implicit-explicit correspondence is assumed to be higher under less-effortful processing, we hypothesized that these political print ads are able to increase the implicit-explicit correspondence. We tested this in an experiment in which participants (N = 164) were exposed to three positively valenced, calming ads of a European right-wing party (treatment group 1), or three negatively valenced, arousing ads of the same party (treatment group 2), or bogus ads (control group). As predicted, implicit attitudes better predicted explicit attitudes in participants who watched the positively valenced, calming ads. Thus, these participants based their overtly expressed evaluation of foreigners more on their (mostly negative) automatic gut reactions. In contrast, we found that egalitarian-related nonprejudicial goals predicted explicit attitudes in participants who watched negatively valenced, arousing ads. Thus, the content of these ads seemed to be ""too strong"" for participants and activated egalitarian-related values, which in turn predicted explicit attitudes. Taken together, our findings underline the importance of considering the relationship between explicit and implicit attitudes when studying the effects of political advertising. © 2013 Hogrefe Publishing.",IAT; Implicit Association Test; Implicit attitudes; Political advertising,,,,,,,,,"Arendt, F., Cultivation effect of a newspaper on reality estimates, explicit and implicit attitudes (2010) Journal of Media Psychology, 22, pp. 147-159; Arendt, F., A newspaper's effect on the strength of automatic associations in memory (2012) Journal of Media Psychology, 24, pp. 1-8; Bargh, J.A., Bond, R.N., Lombardi, W., Tota, M., The additive nature of chronic and temporary sources of construct accessibility (1986) Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 50, pp. 869-878; Brader, T., Striking a responsive chord: How political ads motivate and persuade voters by appealing to emotions (2005) American Journal of Political Science, 49 (2), pp. 388-405. , DOI 10.1111/j.0092-5853.2005.00130.x; Carraro, L., Gawronski, B., Castelli, L., Losing on all fronts: The effects of negative versus positive person-based campaigns on implicit and explicit evaluations of political candidates (2010) British Journal of Social Psychology, 49, pp. 453-470; Collins, A.M., Loftus, E.F., A spreading-activation theory of semantic processing (1975) Psychological Review, 82, pp. 407-428; Czyzewska, M., Ginsburg, H.J., Explicit and implicit effects of anti-marijuana and anti-tobacco TV advertisements (2007) Addictive Behaviors, 32 (1), pp. 114-127. , DOI 10.1016/j.addbeh.2006.03.025, PII S0306460306000955; Devine, P., Stereotypes and prejudice: Their automatic and controlled components (1989) Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 56, pp. 5-18; Dovidio, J., Brigham, J., Johnson, B., Gaertner, S., Stereotyping, prejudice, and discrimination: Another look (1996) Stereotypes and Stereotyping, pp. 276-319. , C.

This study evaluated the effects of an increase in salience factors of age-rating labels for video games and movies. We used eye-tracking technology in a 2 (Parents, Sons) x 2 (Old, New label) experimental design with 52 parent-son dyads. We measured attention to the age-rating labels and attitude toward the media content. Increased attention to the age-rating labels could be demonstrated. Eye-tracking data showed more frequent and prolonged perception of the more salient age-rating labels. The new age-rating labels were more likely to be fixated and were gazed at longer than their old counterparts. At the same time, this did not automatically lead to a reduction in age-inappropriate media attractiveness. Unintended effects that approached marginal significance were found for adolescent boys: The enhanced attention to new age-rating labels was accompanied by an increased attractiveness of age-inappropriate media. Independent of the type of label shown to parents, they neither allowed their sons to use inappropriate media, nor were they willing to buy such video games or movies for them. Increasing salience factors for age-rating labels is a double-edged sword, resulting in increased awareness of age-rating, but not a reduction in attractiveness of age-inappropriate content. © 2013 Hogrefe Publishing.",Age-rating labels; Eye tracking; Forbidden fruit effect; Reactance theory,,,,,,,,,"Argo, J.J., Main, K.J., Meta-analyses of the effectiveness of warning labels (2004) Journal of Public Policy and Marketing, 23 (2), pp. 193-208. , DOI 10.1509/jppm.23.2.193.51400; Brehm, J., (1966) A Theory of Psychological Reactance, , New York: Academic Press; Brehm, J., (1972) Responses to Loss of Freedom: A Theory of Psychological Reactance, , Morristown, NJ: General Learning Press; Bushman, B.J., Effects of warning and information labels on attraction to television violence in viewers of different ages (2006) Journal of Applied Social Psychology, 36 (9), pp. 2073-2078. , DOI 10.1111/j.0021-9029.2006.00094.x; Bushman, B.J., Cantor, J., Media ratings for violence and sex: Implications for policymakers and parents (2003) American Psychologist, 58 (2), pp. 130-141. , DOI 10.1037/0003-066X.58.2.130; Bushman, B.J., Stack, A.D., Forbidden fruit versus tainted fruit: Effects of warning labels on attraction to television violence (1996) Journal of Experimental Psychology: Applied, 2 (3), pp. 207-226; Christenson, P., The effects of parental advisory labels on adolescent music preferences (1992) Journal of Communication, 42 (1), pp. 106-113; Dogruel, L., Jçckel, S., Video game rating systems in the US and europe: Comparing their outcomes International Communication Gazette, , (in press) Accepted for publication; Fox, R.J., Krugman, D.M., Fletcher, J.E., Fischer, P.M., Adolescents' attention to beer and cigarette print ads and associated product warnings (1998) Journal of Advertising, 27 (3), pp. 57-68; Gentile, D., Walsh, D., A normative study of family media habits (2002) Journal of Applied Developmental Psychology, 23 (2), pp. 157-178; Gosselt, J., Media ratings: To see or not to see?

The present study tested the hypothesis that thoughts about death may affect individuals' tendency to select or avoid entertainment media programming containing sexual material. In two experiments, thoughts about death (mortality salience [MS]) were manipulated before college undergraduates expressed interest in viewing television shows and movies with varying amounts of sexual content. In both studies, MS was associated with greater overall interest in sexual media content. Although terror management theory would indicate that sexual worldview should moderate this effect, this was not observed to be the case. In addition, MS was not found to affect interest in other types of highly engaging media content including violent and dramatic content. Limitations regarding generalizability are discussed. Results suggest that MS increases a preference for sexual media content, and that this occurs for individuals with diverse sexual values systems. This is discussed in terms of implications for terror management theory and cognitive models of media influence. © 2013 Hogrefe Publishing.",Death; Sex; Terror management theory; Uses and gratifications,,,,,,,,,"Ackard, D.M., Kearney-Cooke, A., Peterson, C.B., Effect of body image and self-image on women's sexual behaviors (2000) The International Journal of Eating Disorders, 28, pp. 422-429. , doi:10.1002/1098-108X(200012)28:4<422:AID-EAT10>3.0.CO;2-1; Aubrey, J.S., Harrison, K., Kramer, L., Yellin, J., Variety versus timing: Gender differences in college students' sexual expectations as predicted by exposure to sexually oriented television (2003) Communication Research, 30 (4), pp. 432-460. , DOI 10.1177/0093650203253365; Becker, E., (1973) The Denial of Death, , New York: Free Press; Bryant, J., Rockwell, S.C., Effects of massive exposure to sexually oriented prime-time television programming on adolescents' moral judgment (1994) Media, Children and the Family: Social Scientific, Psychodynamic, and Clinical Perspectives, pp. 183-195. , D.

Prior research shows that the media tend to underrepresent the tentativeness and uncertainty of research findings. Yet presently it remains unclear whether beliefs about the certainty or uncertainty of scientific evidence are affected by the mass media's science coverage. In this study, we tested cultivation effects of features from German science TV shows on laypersons' beliefs about science and their interest in science. A sample of adults (N = 700) representative of the German population in terms of age, sex, and education participated in a longitudinal field experiment with an extended Solomon four-group design (two experimental and three control groups). The treatment consisted of six successive media stimuli, which portrayed scientific evidence as either certain or uncertain, over the course of 6 weeks. Results indicate media effects on participants' beliefs about the certainty of scientific evidence. Additionally, the treatment portraying science as certain enhanced participants' interest in science, whereas the uncertainty treatment had no effect on interest. These experimental findings demonstrate cultivation effects using real-world stimuli and are interpreted in support of the claim for a greater acknowledgement of uncertainty in science communication. © 2013 Hogrefe Publishing.",Cultivation processes; Science communication; Uncertainty,,,,,,,,,"Aiken, L.S., West, S.G., (1991) Multiple Regression: Testing and Interpreting Interactions, , Newbury Park, CA: Sage; Ainley, M., Hidi, S., Berndorff, D., Interest, learning, and the psychological processes that mediate their relationship (2002) Journal of Educational Psychology, 94, pp. 3-13; Bandura, A., Social cognitive theory of mass communication (2009) Media Effects: Advances in Theory and Research, pp. 94-124. , J.

For laypersons, mass media and the Internet constitute the main sources of information about climate change. However, so far, little is known about the impact of mass media and, in particular, of online content about climate change on the audience's knowledge regarding and attitudes toward climate change. Therefore, a survey with a representative sample of German Internet users (n = 1,523) was conducted. Based on previous research and theoretical considerations, a measurement model was developed that also included the individual variables environmental awareness and perceived involvement. Additionally, the individual's perspective on media content was taken into account by considering moderator effects of the individual's evaluation of media content and need for information. In this way, television and radio use was shown to slightly affect the levels of knowledge and problem awareness. The moderators media evaluation of media content and need for information proved to be particularly important for the impact of Internet use. The more media reporting was perceived as exaggerated, the more Internet use negatively affected levels of knowledge, problem awareness, and behavioral intentions. Conversely, the interaction between need for information and Internet use increased the impact on problem awareness and behavioral intentions. Hence, it becomes clear that the Internet plays a crucial role in people's attitude generation processes, but is utilized in different ways. © 2013 Hogrefe Publishing.",Climate change; Internet use; Mass media use; Media effects; Science communication,,,,,,,,,"Afifi, W.A., Weiner, J.L., Toward a theory of motivated information management (2004) Communication Theory, 14 (2), pp. 167-190; (2009) Internet Facts: Berichtsband Zur Internet Facts 2009-III [Internet Facts: Report 2009-III], , http://www.agof.de/index.993.de.html; Antilla, L., Climate of scepticism: US newspaper coverage of the science of climate change (2005) Global Environmental Change, 15 (4), pp. 338-352. , DOI 10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2005.08.003, PII S095937800500052X; Apsler, R., Sears, D.O., Warning, personal involvement, and attitude change (1968) Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 9 (2), pp. 162-166; Arlt, D., Hoppe, I., Wolling, J., Climate change and media usage: Effects on problem awareness and behavioural intentions (2011) International Communication Gazette, 73, pp. 45-63; Berlo, D.K., Lemert, J.B., Mertz, R.J., Dimensions for evaluating the acceptability of message sources (1969) Public Opinion Quarterly, 46 (3), pp. 563-576; Besley, J.C., McComas, K.A., Waks, L., Media use and the perceived justice of local science authorities (2006) Journalism and Mass Communication Quarterly, 83 (4), pp. 801-818; Bçhner, J., Ratter, B.M.W., Einleitung: Hamburger symposium geographie-klimawandel und klimawirkung [Introduction: Hamburg symposium geography-climate change and climate impact] (2010) Klimawandel und Klimawirkung.

Study participants estimated the risk of harm to victims and the extent of their suffering. They also indicated their own risk and concern for their own safety. The readers' numeric ability was ascertained thereafter. A trisection of this ability showed that persons of high ability comparatively overestimated others' risk but underestimated their own; this despite indicating greater concerns for their own safety. These results were not altered by consideration of the readers' empathic, experiential, and rational traits. The incorporation of personalized cases of victimization in the news report did not appreciably influence risk assessments. The involvement of cases resulting in major bodily injury, however, increased estimates of the incidence of such robberies. © 2013 Hogrefe Publishing.",Arithmetic aptitude; Exemplification; Numeric ability; Risk perception,,,,,,,,,"Aiken, L.S., West, S.G., Multiple regression: Testing and interpreting interactions (1991) Newbury Park, , CA: Sage; Allen, M., Preiss, R.W., Comparing the persuasiveness of narrative and statistical evidence using meta-analysis (1997) Communication research reports, 14 (2), pp. 125-131; Allen, M., Preiss, R.W., Gayle, B.M., Meta-analytic examination of the base-rate fallacy (2006) Communication Research Reports, 23 (1), pp. 45-51; Aust, C.F., Zillmann, D., Effects of victim exemplification in television news on viewer perception of social issues (1996) Journalism and Mass Communication Quaterly, 73 (4), pp. 787-803; Baesler, E.J., Burgoon, J.K., The temporal effects of story and statistical evidence on belief change (1994) Communication Research, 21, pp. 582-602; Bandura, A., (1997) Self-efficacy: The Exercise of Control, , New York: Freeman; Bandura, A., Toward a psychology of human agency (2006) Perspectives on Psychological Science, 1 (2), pp. 164-180; Berger, S.M., Conditioning through vicarious instigation (1962) Psychological Review, 29, pp. 450-466; Betsch, C., Ulshofer, C., Renkewitz, F., Betsch, T., The influence of narrative v statistical information on perceiving vaccination risks (2011) Medical Decision Making, 31 (5), pp. 742-753; Boster, F.J., Cameron, K.A., Campo, S., Lui, W.-Y., Lilie, J.K., Baker, E.M., Yun, K.A., The persuasive effects of statistical evidence in the presence of exemplars (2000) Communication Studies, 51 (3), pp. 296-306; Brainerd, C.J., Gordon, L.L., Development of verbatim and gist memory for numbers (1994) Developmental Psychology, 30 (2), pp. 163-177; Brosius, H.-B., Bathelt, A., The utility of exemplars in persuasive communications (1994) Communication Research, 21 (1), pp. 48-78; Cacioppo, J.T., Petty, R.E., The need for cognition (1982) Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 42 (1), pp. 116-131; Cacioppo, J.T., Petty, R.E., Kao, C.F., The efficient assessment of need for cognition (1984) Journal of Personality Assessment, 48 (3), pp. 306-307; Daschmann, G., The influence of case studies on reader judgments: Experimental studies on the effect of the media (2001) Konstanz, , Germany: UVK Verlagsgesellschaft; Davis, M.H., A multidimensional approach to individual differences in empathy (1980) JSAS: Catalog of Selected Documents in Psychology, 10, p. 85; Davis, M.H., Measuring individual differences in empathy: Evidence for a multidimensional approach (1983) Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 44 (1), pp. 113-126; Dieckmann, N.F., Slovic, P., Peters, E.M., The use of narrative evidence and explicit likelihood by decision-makers varying in numeracy (2009) Risk Analysis, 29 (10), pp. 1473-1488; Epstein, S., Cognitive-experiential self-theory of personality (2003) Handbook of Psychology: Personality and Social Psychology, 5, pp. 159-184. , T.

Extending previous work on how the general audience perceives and assesses the quality of journalistic news reports about scientific research programs and their respective results, the present study explored how the lay audience perceives and evaluates the visibility of social sciences in the media discourse on controversial public issues (in this particular case, the violent video games debate). The results revealed that the public audience recognizes a high visibility of social sciences and furthermore believes that social sciences can substantially contribute to the public debate about violent video games and their effects. Moreover, we found a positive association between people's recognition of social sciences in the debate and the quality of journalistic coverage on the violent video games debate. These findings are discussed with regard to their implications for research on public understanding of, and public engagement with, science. © 2013 Hogrefe Publishing.",Public understanding of science; Public view of journalism; Science communication; Social science; Violent video games,,,,,,,,,"Albaek, E., Between knowledge and power: Utilization of social science in public policymaking (1995) Policy Sciences, 28, pp. 79-100; Albaaek, E., Christiansen, P.M., Togeby, L., Experts in the mass media: Researchers as sources in Danish daily newspapers, 1961-2001 (2003) Journalism and Mass Communication Quarterly, 80 (4), pp. 937-948; Allum, N., Sturgis, P., Tabourazi, D., Brunton-Smith, I., Science knowledge and attitudes across cultures: A meta-analysis (2008) Public Understanding of Science, 17, pp. 35-54; Anderson, C.A., An update on the effects of playing violent video games (2004) Journal of Adolescence, 27 (1), pp. 113-122. , DOI 10.1016/j.adolescence.2003.10.009; Bogner, A., Menz, W., Science crime.

The aim of this study was to test the influence of sound effects and visual experience on presence. Participants (N = 73) with full, some, or no sight reported presence levels for a scene from an audio drama presented with or without sound effects. Participants with full vision reported higher levels of ecological and spatial presence for dialogue and sound effects than for dialogue alone. For participants with impaired vision, sound effects made no significant difference to presence levels. This was a small, exploratory study. Sound effects increased two dimensions of presence for those with sight. For blind people, words alone provided a rich imaginative experience. This has positive implications for audio description, which necessitates dipping the soundtrack to insert descriptive commentary. It suggests sound effects have a key role in stimulating presence, but this is dependent on the sensory characteristics of the listener. © 2013 Hogrefe Publishing.",Audio description; Audio drama; Presence; Sound effects; Visual impairment,,,,,,,,,"Barfield, W., Zeltzer, D., Sheridan, T.B., Slater, M., Presence and performance within virtual environments (1995) Virtual Environments and Advanced Interface Design, pp. 473-541. , W.

As a consequence, they face the task of constructing a coherent mental model of the issue on the basis of conflicting information. We assume that recipients handle this task by evaluating the plausibility of information against their current understanding and prior knowledge (epistemic validation). On the one hand, information judged as implausible is often not processed further, yielding a bias toward plausible information in the mental model (plausibility bias). On the other hand, recipients can also engage in elaborative processing when they are motivated to develop a justified point of view (epistemic reading goal), which should lead to a rich mental model in contrast to the goal of memorizing facts (receptive reading goal). The present study investigated the relationships of perceived plausibility and comprehension of multiple articles related to a social science topic (the OECD's Programme for International Student Assessment [PISA] study) and effects of a recipient's reading goal, using multilevel models (items nested within recipients) on a trial-by-trial basis. As predicted, information judged as plausible was more likely to be integrated into the recipient's mental model. This plausibility bias was independent of the recipient's reading goal. However, an epistemic reading goal led to an overall stronger mental model than did a receptive reading goal. Moreover, we found a positive relationship between perceived plausibility and memory for text. The present results demonstrate that recipients make sense of science communication about controversial issues by actively monitoring the plausibility of information and regulating comprehension processes according to their reading goals. © 2013 Hogrefe Publishing.",Comprehension; Epistemic validation; Plausibility; Reading goal; Science communication,,,,,,,,,"Baker, L., Differences in the standards used by college students to evaluate their comprehension of expository prose (1985) Reading Research Quarterly, 20, pp. 297-313; Baker, L., Metacognition, comprehension monitoring and the adult reader (1989) Educational Psychology Review, 1, pp. 3-38; Baron, J., Myside bias in thinking about abortion (1995) Thinking and Reasoning, 7, pp. 221-235; Barr, D.J., Analyzing 'visual world' eyetracking data using multilevel logistic regression (2008) Journal of Memory and Language, 59, pp. 457-474; Black, A., Freeman, P., Johnson-Laird, P.N., Plausibility and the comprehension of text (1986) British Journal of Psychology, 77, pp. 51-62; Blanc, N., Kendeou, P., Van Den Broek, P., Brouillet, D., Updating situation models during reading of news reports: Evidence from empirical data and simulations (2008) Discourse Processes, 45, pp. 103-121. , doi:10.1080/016385307 01792784; Bobko, P., A solution to some dilemmas when testing hypotheses about ordinal interactions (1986) Journal of Applied Psychology, 71, pp. 323-326; Bråten, I., Strømsø, H., Britt, A., Trust matters: Examining the role of source evaluation in students' construction of meaning within and across multiple texts (2009) Reading Research Quarterly, 44, pp. 6-28; Britt, M.A., Perfetti, C.A., Sandak, R., Rouet, J.-F., Content integration and source separation in learning from multiple texts (1999) Narrative Comprehension, Causality, and Coherence: Essays in Honor of Tom Trabasso, pp. 209-233. , S.

Specifically, the study was designed to examine whether these games elicit desensitization, facilitation, and disinhibition. Thus, does physiological arousal in response to violent activity decrease over time during game play, and is there a difference between novice and experienced game players (as would be expected if desensitization had occurred)? Do players experience positive emotional states when actively engaged in virtual violent behavior (fighting and killing opponents) - a necessary condition for disinhibition? Do game players frame their motivations in terms of self-defense and game success, as would be necessary for facilitation to occur? The results showed that playing first-person shooters did elicit these requisite patterns of cognitive, physiological, and emotional states. Violent game play is a positive, arousing, present, dominant experience, as required for disinhibition and facilitation. Experienced game players are less aroused than less experienced game players (as required for desensitization).

Goffman's theory of impression management is used, focusing on his understudied ideas about how individuals respond to what others communicate about them, by controlling for information that is discrepant with their desired self-presentation. Data are reported from an exploratory set of qualitative interviews and an online quantitative survey. Results showed that many Facebook users engaged in suppression strategies, albeit infrequently. In addition, users were statistically more likely to not post a potentially damaging image than they were to untag it, and were more likely to untag it than to request that another user delete it. The authors suggest that one possibility is that users avoid more overt identity management strategies because they carry the risk of making users look duplicitous. A potential model is suggested that future research might test to develop a fuller understanding of online identity management. © 2012 Hogrefe Publishing.",Facebook; Identity; Impression management; Untagging,,,,,,,,,"(2012), http://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/facebook.com, July 9 Face-book.com.

Affective dispositions are manipulated to match a liked competitor against one who is disliked. The results indicate that viewers' emotional responses and assessments of satisfaction with a win or loss were dependent on competitor liking. A hedonic reversal occurs in viewer disconfirmation emotions (relief and disappointment) and satisfaction judgments based on outcome desirability. A desirable (undesirable) outcome was one in which a liked (disliked) competitor won, or a disliked (liked) competitor lost. We also found evidence of mediated moderation such that competitor liking moderated the mediating effect of relief and disappointment on outcome satisfaction following an outcome. Outcome satisfaction, conceptualized as a cognitive judgment in our model, was then positively related to viewer enjoyment of the overall experience. Additionally our hypothesized model was found to outperform two competing models. The results elucidate the complex intertwining of affect and cognition in predicting viewer enjoyment of mediated entertainment. © 2012 Hogrefe Publishing.",Affective dispositions; Emotion; Enjoyment; Outcome satisfaction,,,,,,,,,"Alwitt, L.F., Suspense and advertising responses (2002) Journal of Consumer Psychology, 12 (1), pp. 35-49. , DOI 10.1207/153276602753338135; Bartsch, A., Oliver, M.B., Making sense of entertainment: On the interplay of emotion and cognition in entertainment experience (2011) Journal of Media Psychology, 23 (1), pp. 12-17; Bryant, J., Comisky, P., Zillmann, D., The appeal of rough-and-tumble play in televised professional football (1981) Communication Quarterly, 29, pp. 256-262; (2009) Poll: Tiger Woods' Popularity Plummets After Scandal, , http://articles.cnn.com/2009-12-22/us/tiger.woods.poll_1_woods- crashjaimee-grubbs-nightclub-hostess-rachel-uchitel?_s=PM:US, December 29 CNN.

A mediation analysis revealed that TV viewing contributed to the perception of ethnolinguistic vitality, the permeability of intergroup boundaries, and status stability, which in turn affected ethnolinguistic-coping strategies of mobility (moving toward the outgroup), creativity (maintaining identity without confrontation), and competition (fighting for ingroup rights and respect).

Yet, most research examining antisocial behavior has focused on coded content and ignored the influence of other players. This paper examines the influence of the behavior of another player on strategy selection, and the formation of expectations, enjoyment, frustration, and state aggression. It reports an experiment examining antisocial griefing behavior in the multiplayer game Neverwinter Nights, where observational learning, revenge seeking, and expectation formation are tested. The results show that (a) the first encounter that a player has in a game shapes both behavior and expectations; (b) environments that facilitate expectation of cooperation will lead to retaliation against players who grief, whereas environments that facilitate expectations of griefing will increase the frequency of griefing, but not the frequency of retaliation against players who grief; and (c) griefing decreases enjoyment, increases frustration, and increases state aggression for the recipient. © 2012 Hogrefe Publishing.",Aggression; Griefing; Norms; Observational learning; Video games,,,,,,,,,"Anderson, C.A., Bushman, B.J., Effects of violent video games on aggressive behavior, aggressive cognition, aggressive affect, physiological arousal, and prosocial behavior: A Meta-Analytic Review of the Scientific Literature (2001) Psychological Science, 12 (5), pp. 353-359; Anderson, C., Deuser, W., DeNeve, K., Hot temperatures, hostile affect, hostile cognition, and arousal: Tests of a general model of affective aggression (1995) Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, 21, pp. 434-448. , doi: 10.1177/0146167295215002; Anderson, C.A., Dill, K., Video games and aggressive thoughts, feelings, and behavior in the laboratory and in life (2000) Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 78 (4), pp. 772-790. , doi: 10.1037/0022-3514.78.4.772; Anderson, L.R., Holt, C.A., Information cascades in the laboratory (1997) American Economic Review, 87 (5), pp. 847-862; Aron, A., Aron, E., Coups, E.J., (2002) Statistics for Psychology, , Upper Saddle River, NJ: Prentice Hall; Asch, S.E., Effects of group pressure upon the modification and distortion of judgments (1951) Groups, Leadership, and Men, pp. 177-190. , H.

This study explores the effects of (valenced) issue-specific news frames in a disability sports communication. In an experimental study (between-subjects design), 90 participants were randomly assigned to three groups. Participants read a sports news article about the situation in disability sports prior to the 2012 Paralympic Games with a frame that either saliently focused on the athletic performance in disability sports (Group 1), or the fate and (financial) dependency on public support of disability sports (Group 2), or both (mixed frame; Group 3). Participants' importance considerations regarding specific aspects in disability sports, as well as their attitudes toward a portrayed athlete with a disability were measured. The findings showed a significant impact of the applied frames on participants' importance considerations and attitudes. © 2012 Hogrefe Publishing.",Disability; Media effects; News framing; Sport communication,,,,,,,,,"Ball-Rokeach, S.J., Power, G.J., Guthrie, K.K., Waring, H.R., Value-framing abortion in the United States: An application of media system dependency theory (1990) International Journal of Public Opinion Research, 2 (3), pp. 249-273; Biordi, B., Oermann, M.H., The effect of prior experience in a rehabilitation setting on students' attitudes toward the disabled (1993) Rehabilitation Nursing, 18 (2), pp. 95-98; Brewer, P.R., Framing, value words, and citizens' explanations of their issue opinions (2002) Political Communication, 19 (3), pp. 303-316. , DOI 10.1080/01957470290055510; Brewer, P.R., Values, political knowledge, and public opinion about gay rights: A framing-based account (2003) Public Opinion Quarterly, 67, pp. 173-201; Buysse, J.A.M., Borcherding, B., Framing gender and disability: Cross-cultural analysis of photographs from the 2008 paralympic games (2010) International Journal of Sport Communication, 3 (3), pp. 308-321; Chong, D., Druckman, J.N., A theory of framing and opinion formation in competitive elite environments (2007) Journal of Communication, 57 (1), pp. 99-118. , DOI 10.1111/j.1460-2466.2006.00331.x; Chong, D., Druckman, J.N., Framing public opinion in competitive democracies (2007) American Political Science Review, 101 (4), pp. 637-655; Clogston, J.S., Disability coverage in American newspapers (1994) The Disabled, the Media, and the Information Age, pp. 1-17. , J.

However, it is not always possible to provide personally relevant content. Under such circumstances, the best that a system can do is provide contextually relevant peripheral content (e.g., ads) based on the topic of the main content (e.g., search-engine output). This raises an important question: Does context relevance have the same positive effects on user perceptions of websites as personal relevance? If context relevance can indeed make up for the lack of personalization, then boosting it via ad content on the site should serve to enhance appeal even when the main content is not personalized. Using a 2 · 2 factorial experiment (N = 60), we investigated whether perceptions of a website and the ads themselves varied as a function of the presence of personalized site content and ad relevance to website context. Results indicate that personal relevance and context relevance are fungible in contributing to user attitudes toward the site. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed. © 2012 Hogrefe Publishing.",Ad relevance; Attitudes toward online ads; Attitudes toward website; Website personalization,,,,,,,,,"Alpert, S.R., Karat, J., Karat, C.M., Brodie, C., Vergo, J.G., User attitudes regarding a user-adaptive e-commerce web site (2003) User Modeling and User-Adapted Interaction, 13, pp. 373-396; Ansari, A., Mela, C.F., E-customization (2003) Journal of Marketing Research, 40 (2), pp. 131-145. , DOI 10.1509/jmkr.40.2.131.19224; Bakker, A.B., Persuasive communication about AIDS prevention: Need for cognition determines the impact of message format (1999) AIDS Education and Prevention, 11 (2), pp. 150-162; Beier, J., Kalyanaraman, S., The psychological appeal of ""mynews.com"": The interplay between customization and recommendation sources in news websites (2008) 58th Annual Conference of the International Communication Association, , Paper presented at the, Montreal, Canada, May 2008; Berghel, H., Berleant, D., Foy, T., McGuire, M., Cyberbrowsing: Information customization on the web (1999) Journal of the American Society for Information Science, 50, pp. 505-513; Blom, J., Personalization - A taxonomy (2000) Extended Abstracts of the CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems, , New York: ACM; (2002) Ad Clutter, , http://www.burstmedia.com/pdf/2002_07_01.pdf, July 1, Retrieved from; Calvo, M.G., Castillo, M.D., Estevez, A., On-line predictive inferences in reading: Processing time during versus after the priming context (1999) Memory and Cognition, 27 (5), pp. 834-843; Cho, C.-H., Cheon, H.J., Why do people avoid advertising on the internet?

In an experiment (N = 211) with physical temperature and Web page color as between-subjects factors and need for cognition as a measured independent variable, participants viewed an organization's Web page. Cognitive misers who experienced physical cold (versus warmth) reported less favorable attitudes toward the Web page. This interaction disappeared, however, when they viewed a Web page that featured a red color scheme, as red seemed to have stimulated an increase in central-route analytic cognitive processing. This pattern of results illustrates the utility of the elaboration likelihood model in studying impression formation in online contexts. © 2012 Hogrefe Publishing.",Color; Dual-process models; Elaboration likelihood model; Human-computer interaction; Impression formation,,,,,,,,,"Aiken, L.S., West, S.G., (1991) Multiple Regression: Testing and Interpreting Interactions, , Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage; Asch, S.E., Forming impressions of personality (1946) Journal of Abnormal Social Psychology, 42, pp. 258-290. , doi: 10.1037/h0055756; Bellizzi, J.A., Crowley, A.E., Hasty, R.W., The effects of color in store design (1983) Journal of Retailing, 59, pp. 21-45; Booth-Butterfield, S., Welbourne, J., The elaboration likelihoodmodel: Its impact on persuasion theory and research (2002) The Persuasion Handbook: Developments in Theory and Practice, pp. 155-173. , J.

These concepts often overlap (e.g., addiction or pathological gaming), include negative consequences in their definition, or are very game-specific (e.g., collective play). We argue that the field would benefit from using concepts that are well-established in other domains. Extending earlier work to the interpersonal domain, we examined the effects of obsessive and harmonious passion for massively multiplayer online role-playing games (MMORPGs) on the number and quality of online and offline friendships. Obsessive passion describes an irrepressible urge to engage in an activity, whereas harmonious passion describes the voluntary engagement in an activity. In an online survey of 406 MMORPG players, we found differential relationships between obsessive and harmonious passion and the number and quality of online and offline friendships.

Much of this research, however, has been cross-sectional, has assessed only straightforward exposure-casual sex associations, and has employed convenience samples of adolescents. This study employed nationally representative longitudinal data from the General Social Survey to explore whether casual sex behavior predicted over time change in US adults' pornography exposure and whether pornography exposure predicted over time change in US adults' casual sex behavior. Casual sex behavior did not predict over time change in pornography exposure, but pornography exposure did predict over time change in casual sex behavior. To test the prediction of Wright's acquisition, activation, application model of sexual socialization ( 3AM) that negative affective states make the application of risky sexual scripts provided by sexual media more likely (Wright, 2011a) the moderating role of unhappiness was explored. In support of the model, pornography exposure was associated with nearly a sevenfold over time increase in the odds of having engaged in casual sex for unhappy individuals, but was unrelated to the casual sex behavior of very happy individuals. © 2012 Hogrefe Publishing.",Casual sex; Pornography; Selective exposure; Sexual socialization; Unhappiness,,,,,,,,,"Aldrich, J.H., Nelson, F.D., (1984) Linear Probability Logit, and Probit Models, , Newbury Park, CA: Sage; Allen, M., D'Alessio, D., Emmers, T.M., Gebhardt, L., The role of educational briefings in mitigating effects of experimental exposure to violence sexually explicit material: A meta-analysis (1996) The Journal of Sex Research, 33, pp. 135-141; Policy statement: Sexuality, contraception, and the media (2010) Pediatrics, 126, pp. 576-582. , American Academy of Pediatrics; Arterburn, S., Stoeker, F., (2009) Every Man's Battle: Winning the War on Sexual Temptation One Victory at a Time, , New York: Random House; Bennett, D.L., Bauman, A., Adolescent mental health and risky sexual behavior: Young people need health care that covers psychological, sexual, and social areas (2000) British Medical Journal, 321, pp. 251-252; Bleakley, A., Hennessy, M., Fishbein, M., Jordan, A., It works both ways: The relationship between exposure to sexual content in the media and adolescent sexual behavior (2008) Media Psychology, 11, pp. 443-461; Boies, S.C., University students' uses of and reactions to online sexual information and entertainment: Links to online and offline sexual behavior (2002) The Canadian Journal of Human Sexuality, 11, pp. 77-89; Braun-Courville, D.K., Rojas, M., Exposure to sexually explicit web sites and adolescent sexual attitudes and behaviors (2009) Journal of Adolescent Health, 45, pp. 156-162; Brosius, H., Weaver, J.B., Staab, J.F., Exploring the social and sexual ""reality"" of contemporary pornography (1993) The Journal of Sex Research, 30, pp. 161-170; Brown, J.D., L'Engle, K.L., X-rated: Sexual attitudes and behaviors associated with US early adolescents' exposure to sexually explicit media (2009) Communication Research, 36, pp. 129-151; Brown, J.D., L'Engle, K.L., Pardun, C.J., Guo, G., Kenneavy, K., Jackson, C., Sexy media matter: Exposure to sexual content in music, movies, television, and magazines predicts black and white adolescents' sexual behavior (2006) Pediatrics, 117, pp. 1018-1027; Buss, D.M., Schmitt, D.P., Sexual strategies theory: An evolutionary perspective on human mating (1993) Psychological Review, 100, pp. 204-232; Carnes, P., Delmonico, D.L., Griffin, E., (2001) The Shadows of the Net: Breaking Free of Compulsive Online Sexual Behavior, , Center City, MN: Hazelden; Carroll, J.S., Padilla-Walker, L.M., Nelson, L.J., Olson, C.D., McNamara Barry, C., Madsen, S.D., Generation XXX: Pornography acceptance and use among emerging adults (2008) Journal of Adolescent Research, 23, pp. 6-30; Chaney, M.P., Chang, C.Y., A trio of turmoil for internet sexually addicted men who have sex with men: Boredom proneness, social connectedness, and dissociation (2005) Sexual Addiction & Compulsivity, 12, pp. 3-18; Collins, R.L., Elliott, M.N., Berry, S.H., Kanouse, D.E., Kunkel, D., Hunter, S.B., Miu, A., Watching sex on television predicts adolescent initiation of sexual behavior (2004) Pediatrics, 114, pp. 280-289; Cooper, A., Delmonico, D.L., Burg, R., Cybersex users, abusers, and compulsives: New findings and implications (2000) Sexual Addiction & Compulsivity, 7, pp. 5-29; Cooper, A., Morahan-Martin, J., Mathy, R.M., Maheu, M., Toward an increased understanding of user demographics in online sexual activities (2002) Journal of Sex & Marital Therapy, 28, pp. 105-129; Cope-Farrar, K.M., Kunkel, D., Sexual messages in teens' favorite prime-time television programs (2002) Sexual Teens, Sexual Media, pp. 59-78. , J.

For radical, extremist, and other ideologically "" sensitive"" groups and organizations in particular, Internet forums are a very efficient and widely used tool to connect members, inform others about the group's agenda, and attract new members. Whereas members of such groups may be reluctant to express their opinions in interviews or surveys, we argue that Internet forums can yield an abundance of useful ""natural"" discursive data for social scientific research. Based on two exemplary studies, we present a practical guide for the analysis of such data, including data-sampling strategies, the refinement of the data for computer-assisted qualitative and quantitative analysis, and strategies for in-depth analysis. The first study is an in-depth analysis of discourses within a German neo-Nazi discussion board. In the second, nine online forums for young German Muslims were analyzed and compared. Advantages and potential issues with analyzing Internet forums are discussed. © 2012 Hogrefe Publishing.",Computer-assisted qualitative data analysis; Correspondence analysis; Internet forums; Message boards; Online communication,,,,,,,,,"Abdulla, R.A., Islam, jihad, and terrorism in post-9/11 arabic forums (2007) Journal of Computer-mediated Communication, 12, pp. 1063-1081; Almond, G.A., Appleby, R.S., Sivan, E., (2003) Strong Religion: The Rise of Fundamentalisms Around the World, , Chicago, IL: University of Chicago Press; Bargh, J.A., McKenna, K.Y.A., The internet and social life (2004) Annual Review of Psychology, 55, pp. 573-590; Bauer, M.W., Aarts, B., Corpus construction: A principle for qualitative data collection (2000) Qualitative Researching with Text, Image and Sound: A Practical Handbook, pp. 19-37. , M.

This paradoxical situation challenges both theoretical approaches and empirical studies in entertainment research. Based on an appraisal-theoretical framework, the present study examined the role of multiple appraisals of recipients' sadness. It is argued that these so-called meta-appraisals are able to transform one's sadness into a positive meta-emotion (i.e., enjoyment); this process is called valence transformation. Results of an experimental study (N = 149) showed that in cases of a sad film ending, participants experienced higher levels of sadness than they did in cases of a happy ending. Furthermore, given a sad ending, meta-appraisal processes were activated that mediated the relationship between sadness and enjoyment. If the film had a happy ending, however, there were no indirect effects. Results are discussed in the light of theoretical considerations. © 2012 Hogrefe Publishing.",Appraisal; Emotion; Enjoyment; Meta-appraisal; Valence transformation,,,,,,,,,"Baron, R.M., Kenny, D.A., The moderator-mediator variable distinction in social psychological research: Conceptual, strategic, and statistical considerations (1986) Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 51, pp. 1173-1182; Barr-Zisowitz, C., Sadness - Is there such a thing?

Further, an investigation was done to find out if reading articles from the same newspaper produces a short-term effect on the same measure and if (1) emotionalization of the newspaper texts, (2) emotional reactions of the reader (indicated by arousal), and (3) attributed text credibility moderate the short-term treatment effect. Eighty-five participants were assigned to one of three experimental conditions. Participants in the control group received short factual crime texts, where the nationality of the offender was not mentioned. Participants in the factual treatment group received the same texts, but the foreign nationality was mentioned. Participants in the emotionalized treatment group received emotionalized articles (i.e., texts which are high in vividness and frequency) covering the same crimes, with the foreign nationality mentioned. Supporting empirical evidence for implicit cultivation and a shortterm effect was found. However, only emotionalized articles produced a short-term effect on the strength of the automatic association, indicating that newspaper texts must have a minimum of stimulus intensity to overcome an effect threshold. There were no moderating effects of arousal or credibility pertaining to the impact on the implicit measure. However, credibility moderated the short-term effect on a first-order judgment (i.e., estimated frequency of foreigners of all criminals). This indicates that a newspaper's effect on the strength of automatic associations is relatively independent from processes of propositional reasoning. © 2012 Hogrefe Publishing.",Arousal; Cultivation; Implicit Association Test (IAT); Newspaper,,,,,,,,,"Allen, J.J.B., Chambers, A.S., Towers, D.N., The many metrics of cardiac chronotropy: A pragmatic primer and a brief comparison of metrics (2007) Biological Psychology, 74 (2), pp. 243-262. , DOI 10.1016/j.biopsycho.2006.08.005, PII S0301051106001864, Biological Psychology on Cardiac Vagal Control, Emotion, Psychopathology, and Health.

Although both habits and addictive tendencies may determine higher amounts of video game use, the present study examines whether the impact of habits and addictive tendencies on video game use may also be lower the less users intend to play (indicating a moderating role of intention). To test these assumptions, survey data were collected in two waves (N = 351), measuring causal factors in the first wave and outcomes (subsequent video game use) in the second. Results of mediation analyses reveal a positive impact of both habits and addictive tendencies on video game use that is partly affected by users' intentions. Furthermore, moderation analyses suggest that the impact of habits, but not of addictive tendencies, on video game use decreases, the less users intend to play. Taken together, these findings suggest that users' video game habits, addictive tendencies, and intentions jointly determine video game use. © 2012 Hogrefe Publishing.",Addiction; Habit; Intention; Media choice; Video games,,,,,,,,,"Aarts, H., Dijksterhuis, A., Habits as knowledge structures: Automaticity in goal-directed behavior (2000) Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 78, pp. 53-63; Ajzen, I., Residual effects of past on later behavior: Habituation and reasoned action perspectives (2002) Personality and Social Psychology Review, 6 (2), pp. 107-122; Ajzen, I., (2006) Constructing a TpB Questionnaire: Conceptual and methodological considerations, , http://people.umass.edu/aizen/publications.html, Retrieved from; Ajzen, I., Madden, J.T., Prediction of goal directed behavior: Attitudes, intentions and perceived control (1986) Journal of Experimental Social Psychology, 22, pp. 253-274; Bargh, J.A., The four horsemen of automaticity: Awareness, efficiency, intention, and control in social cognition (1994) Handbook of Social Cognition, pp. 1-40. , In R.

Sadness, perceived reality, involvement, and enjoyment were measured after participants watched a sad film. The results from structural equation modeling (SEM) analyses indicated that a tragic film induces sadness and that sadness is a positive predictor of perceived reality of the story and sense of involvement. Involvement, in turn, is a positive predictor of enjoyment of the sad film. Sadness predicted subject-oriented enjoyment (measured by a self-referent item: ""I enjoyed the movie"") more significantly than object-oriented enjoyment (measured by an object-referent item: ""The movie entertained me""). Perceived reality fully mediated object-oriented enjoyment, but only partially mediated subject-oriented enjoyment. © 2012 Hogrefe Publishing.",Enjoyment; Perceived reality; Sadness; Structural equation modeling; Tragedy,,,,,,,,,"Ahn, D., Toward resolving the paradoxical enjoyment of tragic drama (2011) Journal of Media Economics and Culture, 9 (4), pp. 181-222; Biocca, F., The evolution of interactive media: Toward ""being there"" in nonlinear narrative worlds (2002) Narrative Impact: Social and Cognitive Foundations, pp. 97-129. , In M.

Nearly all of the research on sex differences in mass media utilization has been based on samples from the United States and a few other Western countries. Aim. The present study examines sex differences in mass media utilization in four Asian countries (Japan, Malaysia, South Korea, and Singapore). Methods. College students self-reported the frequency with which they accessed the following five mass media outlets: television dramas, televised news and documentaries, music, newspapers and magazines, and the Internet. Results. Two significant sex differences were found when participants from the four countries were considered as a whole: Women watched television dramas more than did men; and in Japan, female students listened to music more than did their male counterparts. Limitations. A wider array of mass media outlets could have been explored. Conclusions. Findings were largely consistent with results from studies conducted elsewhere in the world, particularly regarding sex differences in television drama viewing. A neurohormonal evolutionary explanation is offered for the basic findings.",Asia; evolutionary neurohormonal influences; mass media utilization; sex differences; sex roles,,,,,,,,,"Bailey, J.M., Gaulin, S., Agyei, Y., Gladue, B.A., Effects of gender and sexual orientation on evolutionarily relevant aspects of human mating psychology (1994) Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 66, pp. 1081-1093; Baron-Cohen, S., (2003) The Essential Difference: Men, Women and the Extreme Male Brain, , London: Penguin Books; Connellan, J., Baron-Cohen, S., Wheelwright, S., Batki, A., Ahluwalia, J., Sex differences in human neonatal social perception (2000) Infant Behavior and Development, 23, pp. 113-118; Eagly, A., Wood, W., Diekman, A., Social role theory of sex differences and similarities: A current appraisal (2000) The Developmental Social Psychology of Gender, pp. 123-174. , T.

Experimental research (N = 355) was carried out with a 2 × 2 between-subjects factor design in which the news frame and group cues were manipulated in a news story on the consequences of the increase in immigration in Spain, and their impact on cognitive, attitudinal, and emotional variables was assessed. The results show that the type of news frame stressed in the report exerted significant cognitive, attitudinal, and emotional effects. It was also found that the emotional impact aroused by the news frame was conditioned by the incidental presence of information regarding the national or geographic origin of the immigrants in question. These results are consistent with the hypotheses posed and partially support the argument that the framing effect is a process governed by heuristic processing.",experimental research; framing effect; framing theory; group cue; immigration,,,,,,,,,"Aday, S., The framesetting effects of news: An experimental test of advocacy versus objectivist frames (2006) Journalism and Mass Communication Quarterly, 83 (4), pp. 767-784; Boyle, M.P., Schmierbach, M., Armstrong, C.L., Cho, J., McCluskey, M., McLeod, D.M., Shah, D.V., Expressive responses to news stories about extremist groups: A framing experiment (2006) Journal of Communication, 56 (2), pp. 271-288; Brader, T., Valentino, N.A., Suhay, E., What triggers public opposition to immigration?

The first part presents the theoretical basis: It uses research on expertise to gain insights into the instructor's perspective, and research from psycholinguistics and research on writing to describe the cognitive demands of communicating expert knowledge to nonexperts. The second part reports empirical results from online health counseling. This reveals that the persistence of artifacts makes the expert perspective more prominent and seems to hinder experts' engagement in perspective taking during instruction. Two central variables that emerge in computer-mediated communication are discussed: The availability of texts and graphics as well as the nonexpert's use of technical jargon. Both influence an expert's choice of words and selection of content for a particular explanation. Hence, features of the learning environment, the communication platform, or the information provided by users at help desks play a crucial role in forming the expert's perspective taking. Conclusions are drawn on how to improve perspective taking in computer-mediated instructional communication.",adaptation; computer-mediated instructional communication; expert-layperson communication; perspective taking; written communication,,,,,,,,,"Alamargot, D., Chanquoy, L., (2001) Studies in Writing: Vol. 9.

For instance, mere exposure to high-value goods can enhance cultural worldview and self-esteem and thus act as a buffer against existential anguish. Besides cultural worldview and self-esteem, close relationships can help to reduce existential anguish. Drawing upon terror management theory (TMT), the current study addressed the question of whether MS combined with emotional commercials influences perception of the ads as well as further behavior. We compared the effects of socioemotional versus informational ads after MS induction, measuring perceived emotionality of the ads, evaluation of ads and products, recall, and buying intention. Significant effects were found in all outcome variables, except for recall, supporting the hypothesis that under MS induction, commercials with a socioemotional content can enhance advertisement impact.",close relationships;

Previous work has demonstrated that this social guidance forms the basis of people's expectations and subsequently affects people's experience. The current work extends previous research by exploring the influence of peer evaluations of a story, on enjoyment of and psychological transportation in the written narrative. In two experiments, participants read peer evaluations prior to reading the story. Results of Experiment 1 revealed that social influence guides readers' expectations, attention to elements in the narrative, reported enjoyment, and feelings of transportation in the narrative. This influence was particularly apparent when readers were given unfavorable reviews of the stimulus. In the second experiment, readers were given peer evaluations that were either confirmed or disconfirmed by other readers. Results indicated that valence of peer evaluations influenced both transportation and enjoyment. Additionally, inconsistent evaluations increased feelings of transportation, but consistency alone had no effect on reported enjoyment. Implications for social media experiences and future directions in research on entertainment media are discussed.",entertainment media; expectations; narrative; social influence; uncertainty,,,,,,,,,"Baumeister, R.F., Bratslavsky, E., Finkenauer, C., Vohs, K.D., Bad Is Stronger Than Good (2001) Review of General Psychology, 5 (4), pp. 323-370. , DOI 10.1037//1089-2680.5.4.323; Bruner, J., The narrative construction of reality (1992) Piaget's Theory: Prospects and Possibilities, pp. 229-248. , H.Beilin & P.

By contrast, traditional approaches have treated PSI as a sort of friendship with the mediated persona. Participants (N = 249) were randomly assigned to self-select a liked or disliked television persona. Various viewer reactions to that character were measured using two different measures of PSI. The data revealed that participants did experience PSI with disliked characters as well as liked characters, and that the two measures of PSI did not appear to assess the same construct.

Furthermore, associations between the modes of reception and individual favored coping strategies were examined. One hundred fifty nondepressive and nonsuicidal adults living in Austria watched one of three films featuring the death of the main character. Data on the viewers' mood, inner tensions, self-esteem, life satisfaction, depression, suicidal tendencies, attitudes toward suicide, predominantly used modes of reception, and preferred coping strategies were collected with questionnaires that were handed out before and after seeing the movie. Results indicated that drama viewing was linked to both negative and positive effects: on the one hand, to a deterioration of mood as well as an increase of inner tensions and depression scores, and on the other hand, to a rise in self-esteem and life satisfaction as well as a drop in suicidal tendencies. The more a subject was involved in the film, the more pronounced were the negative impacts and the smaller were the positive reactions. The viewers' preferred coping strategies were partly associated with the modes of reception: the more an individual preferred to seek social support when facing a problem, the more he or she identified with the drama's protagonist and tried to find behavior patterns in the movie to improve his or her own life.",coping; drama; film effects; involvement; modes of reception,,,,,,,,,"Appel, M., Koch, E., Schreier, M., Groeben, N., Aspekte des Leseerlebens: Skalenentwicklung[Aspects of reading experience: Scale development] (2002) Zeitschrift Fudie;r Medienpsychologie, 14 (4), pp. 149-154; Basil, M.D., Identification as a mediator of celebrity effects (1996) Journal of Broadcasting & Electronic Media, 40, pp. 478-495; Becker, P., Scales for longitudinal studies of affective state (1988) Zeitschrift Fudie;r Experimentelle und Angewandte Psychologie, 35, pp. 345-369; Biblarz, A., Brown, R.M., Biblarz, D.N., Pilgrim, M., Baldree, B.F., Media influence on attitudes toward suicide (1991) Suicide and Life-Threatening Behavior, 21, pp. 374-384; Brown, W.J., Basil, M.D., Media celebrities and public health: Responses to""Magic"" Johnson's HIV disclosure and its impact on AIDS risk and high-risk behaviors (1995) Health Communication, 7 (4), pp. 345-370; Cantor, J., Fright reactions to mass media (2002) Advances in Theory and Research, pp. 287-306. , J.Bryant & D.Zillmann (Eds.), Media effects Hillsdale, NJ: Erlbaum; Carver, C.S., Scheier, M.F., Weintraub, J.K., Assessing coping strategies: A theoretically based approach (1989) Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 56, pp. 267-283; Charlton, M., Borcsa, M., Thematische voreingenommenheit, involvement und formen der identifikation.

The three dimensions of perceived realism were considered: plausibility, typicality, and narrative consistency. Data from a survey of college students were examined with confirmatory factor analyses and hierarchical regression analyses. Across the three dramas (ER, Grey's Anatomy, and House), narrative consistency predicted positive perceptions about physicians. Perceived plausibility and typicality of the medical dramas showed no significant association with perceptions about physicians. These results illustrate the importance of distinguishing different dimensions of perceived realism and the importance of narrative consistency in influencing social beliefs.",cultivation theory; narrative consistency; perceived realism,,,,,,,,,"Aiken, L.S., West, S.G., (1991) Multiple Regression: Testing and Interpreting Interactions, , Newbury Park, CA: Sage; Bagozzi, R.P., Yi, Y., One the evaluation of structural equation models (1988) Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science, 16, pp. 74-84; Berkowitz, L., Alioto, J., The meaning of an observed event as a determinant of its aggressive consequences (1973) Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 28, pp. 206-217; Bilandzic, H., Rossler, P., Life according to television.

The more time spent on media the poorer cognitive performance is. This association has mainly been found for general-audience, violent, and action-loaded contents but not for educational contents. Typically, long-term-explanations like the time-displacement hypothesis are considered to account for this relation, although this cannot fully explain the association. Additionally short-term explanations should be considered, since it can be expected that media-induced stress can impair information processing. The present study compares short-term effects regarding memory performance and the ability to concentrate, using four different experimental conditions (high- vs. low-arousing films and video games). It was also examined if the experienced level of stress mediates group differences and if habitual media, habitual use of age-restricted contents or the trait sensation seeking moderate this mediation. Participants consisted of N = 117 university students. They were asked to learn written items before media use and to recall these after having used the media. Further, the ability to concentrate was measured. Experimental groups differed with regard to the cognitive outcome measures after media use. A significant univariate difference was found for high- vs. low-arousing contents in general (independent of type of media), the high-arousing content leading to poorer ability to concentrate after media use. The expected mediating and moderating effects are not supported.

One major current topic in agent design consequently is to enhance their believability, often by incorporating internal models of emotions or motivations. As psychological theories often lack the necessary details for direct implementation, many agent modelers currently rely on models that are rather marginal in current psychological research, or models that are created ad hoc with little theoretical and empirical foundation. The goal of this article is both to raise psychologists' awareness of the central challenges in the process of creating psychologically believable agents, and to recommend existing psychological frameworks to the virtual agents community that seem particularly useful for implementation in ECAs. Special attention is paid to a computationally detailed model of basic social motives that seems particularly useful for implementation: the Zurich model of social motivation.",believability; embodied conversational agents; Zurich model of social motivation,,,,,,,,,"Atkinson, J.W., Birch, D., (1970) The Dynamics of Action., , Oxford, UK: John Wiley; Back, M., Schmukle, S.C., Egloff, B., A closer look at first sight: Social relations lens model analysis of personality and interpersonal attraction at zero acquaintance European Journal of Personality, , (in press); Bailenson, J., Yee, N., Digital chameleons (2005) Psychological Science, 16, pp. 814-819; Bailenson, J.N., Yee, N., Patel, K., Beall, A.C., Detecting digital chameleons (2008) Computers in Human Behavior, 24 (1), pp. 66-87. , DOI 10.1016/j.chb.2007.01.015, PII S0747563207000040; Bates, J., The role of emotion in believable characters (1994) Communications of the ACM, 37, pp. 122-125; Becker-Asano, C., Wachsmuth, I., Affect simulation with primary and secondary emotions (2008) Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 5208, pp. 15-28; Beutler, L.E., Harwood, T.M., Virtual reality in psychotherapy training (2004) Journal of Clinical Psychology, 60 (3), pp. 317-330. , DOI 10.1002/jclp.10266; Bischof, N., A systems approach toward the functional connections of attachment and fear (1975) Child Development, 46, pp. 801-817; Bischof, N., The varieties of smiling and the problem of motivational acclimatization (1996) Zeitschrift fur Psychologie, 204 (1), pp. 1-40; Bischof, N., Das Rätsel Ödipus (2001) Die Biologischen Wurzeln des Urkonflikts von Intimität und Autonomie[The Riddle of Oedipus: The Biological Roots of the Core Conflict between Intimacy and Autonomy], , München: Piper; Blascovich, J., Loomis, J., Beall, A.C., Swinth, K.R., Hoyt, C.L., Bailenson, J.N., Immersive virtual environment technology as a methodological tool for social psychology (2002) Psychological Inquiry, 13 (2), pp. 103-124; Blumberg, B., Action-selection in Hamsterdam: Lessons from ethology (1994) Third Conference on the Simulation of Adaptive Behavior, , Paper presented at the Cambridge, MA, USA; Borutta, I., Sosnowski, S., Zehetleitner, M., Bischof, N., Kühnlenz, K., Generating artificial smile variations based on a psychological system-theoretic approach (2009) 18th IEEE International Symposium on Robot and Human Interactive Communication (Ro-Man), , Paper presented at the Toyama, Japan; Bowlby, J., (1980) Attachment and Loss., , New York, NY: Basic Books; Cassell, J., More than just another pretty face: Embodied conversational interface agents (2000) Communications of the ACM, 43, pp. 70-78; Cassell, J., Embodied conversational agents: Representation and intelligence in user interfaces (2001) AI Magazine, 22 (4), pp. 67-83; Cassell, J., Bickmore, T., Campbell, L., Vilhjalmsson, H., Yan, H., Conversation as a system framework: Designing embodied conversational agents (1999) Embodied Conversational Agents., , J.Cassell, E.Churchill, S.Prevost, & J.Sullivan (Eds.), Cambridge, MA: MIT Press; Cassell, J., Churchill, E., Prevost, S., Sullivan, J., (2000) Embodied Conversational Agents., , Cambridge, MA: MIT Press; Chartrand, T., Bargh, J., The chameleon effect: The perception-behavior link and social interaction (1999) Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 76, pp. 893-910; De Rosis, F., Pelachaud, C., Poggi, I., Carofiglio, V., Carolis, B., From Greta's mind to her face: Modelling the dynamics of affective states in a conversational embodied agent (2003) International Journal of Human-Computer Studies, 1-2, pp. 81-118; Fridlund, A.J., Evolution and facial action in reflex, social motive, and paralanguage (1991) Biological Psychology, 32, pp. 3-100; Grammer, K., Kruck, K., Magnusson, M., The courtship dance: Patterns of nonverbal synchronization in opposite-sex encounters (1998) Journal of Nonverbal Behavior, 22, pp. 3-29; Gratch, J., True emotion vs. social intentions in nonverbal communication (2008) Towards A Synthesis for Embodied Conversational Agents.

In a 2 × 2 within-subjects experiment, participants watched anti-tobacco television ads that varied in the amount of fear and disgust content. The results of this study suggest that both fear and disgust content in anti-tobacco television ads have significant effects on resources allocated to encoding the messages, on recognition memory, and on emotional responses. Most interesting, although messages high in both fear and disgust content were rated the most unpleasant and arousing, these same messages reduced corrugator responses, accelerated heart rate, and worsened recognition memory. Implications for the study of motivated processing and for the construction of anti-tobacco messages are discussed.",defensive responding; disgust; fear appeals; motivated processing,,,,,,,,,"Balaban, M.T., Taussig, H.N., Salience of fear/threat in the affective modulation of the human startle blink (1994) Biological Psychology, 38 (2-3), pp. 117-131. , DOI 10.1016/0301-0511(94)90033-7; Bolls, P.D., Lang, A., Potter, R.F., The effects of message valence and listener arousal on attention, memory and facial muscular responses to radio (2001) Communication Research, 28 (5), pp. 627-651; Bradley, M.M., Emotion and motivation (2000) Handbook of Psychophysiology, pp. 602-642. , J.

To better understand how affective factors can stimulate or impede cognitive elaboration processes, we review research on motivated cognition that has dealt with the influence of arousal, valence, and personal relevance on cognitive depth. The role of affect in defensive information processing (i.e., the motivated neglect or denial of information) is also considered. Specifically, we discuss how research on motivated cognition can help explain thought-provoking entertainment experiences, and the potential of such experiences to stimulate self-reflection and personal growth.",affect; appreciation; entertainment; eudaimonia; motivated cognition,,,,,,,,,"Appel, M., Richter, T., Persuasive effects of fictional narratives increase over time (2007) Media Psychology, 10, pp. 113-134; Aust, C.F., Zillmann, D., Effects of victim exemplification in television news on viewer perception of social issues (1996) Journalism & Mass Communication Quarterly, 73, pp. 878-1803; Bartsch, A., Appel, M., Storch, D., Predicting Emotions and Meta-emotions at the Movies.

It begins by introducing the MFT's conception of morality as an intuitive evaluative response governed by the association of moral codes organized in five mental modules. These include harm/care (concerned with suffering and empathy); fairness (related to reciprocity and justice); loyalty (dealing with common good and punitiveness toward outsiders); authority (negotiating dominance hierarchies); and purity (concerned with sanctity and contamination).After discussing initial tests examining MFT's application to narrative appeal, and its potential broad application to entertainment theory, a model of intuitive morality and exemplars (MIME) is presented. The model describes long-term and short-term processes of reciprocal influence between media and moral intuition. In the long-term, the model predicts that repeated exposure to module-related content will lead to an individual and culturally-shared increase in the salience of specific modules and module exemplars. In the short-term, resulting patterns of module salience will affect the immediate appraisal of media content or, if content presents ambiguous or complex moral patterns, a delayed response though careful reappraisal. Patterns of positive or negative evaluative responses resulting from these appraisal processes are expected to shape individual and aggregate patterns of selective exposure to media, as well as the subsequent production of content within media systems driven by these exposure patterns. The paper concludes with an example of the model's utility by showing how its short-term components can be applied to address conceptual difficulties in distinguishing enjoyment from appreciation.",enjoyment and appreciation; media entertainment; MIME; moral foundations theory; moral intuition,,,,,,,,,"Aristotle, Ross, W.D., (1931) Nicomachean Ethics, , Ross W.

It dwells on Raney's distinction between pleasure-based versus appreciation-based media entertainment. On a normative level, Raney seems to favor appreciation-based media entertainment over pleasure-based entertainment, because he presumes the latter one to result from more automatic, archaic and, overall, less desirable moral activity among users. Recalling and extending Raney's arguments, the present article discuss the ambivalence of seemingly moral judgments of characters, the potential selfishness of users' concern for the fate of the protagonist, and potential biases in the appraisals of justice restoration. However, the present article wrestles with Raney's arguments underlying his critical evaluation of pleasure-based entertainment. While agreeing to most of his arguments about the moral mechanisms underlying pleasure-based entertainment, it departs from his normative position. The present article argues that pleasure-based entertainment may fulfill a psychologically functional role: it may allow people to effectively recreate and to restore exhausted resources.",challenge; enjoyment; entertainment; morality; recreation,,,,,,,,,"Apter, M.J., The dangerous edge (1992) The Psychology of Excitement., , New York: The Free Press; Baumeister, R., Free will in scientific psychology (2008) Perspectives on Psychological Science, 3, pp. 14-19; Baumeister, R.F., Sparks, E.A., Stillman, T.F., Vohs, K.D., Free will in consumer behavior: Self-control, ego depletion, and choice (2008) Journal of Consumer Psychology, 18, pp. 4-13; Bosshart, L., Macconi, I., Defining ""entertainment"" (1998) Communication Research Trends, 18, pp. 3-6; Deci, E.L., Ryan, R.M., The ""What"" and ""Why"" of Goal Pursuits: Human Needs and the Self-Determination of Behavior (2000) Psychological Inquiry, 11 (4), pp. 227-268; Dehm, U., Fernseh-Unterhaltung aus der Sicht der Zuschauer [TV-entertainment in the eyes of the audience] (1984) Media Perspektiven, 8, pp. 630-643; Gailliot, M.T., Schmeichel, B.J., Baumeister, R.F., Self-regulatory processes defend against the threat of death: Effects of self-control depletion and trait self-control on thoughts and fears of dying (2006) Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 91 (1), pp. 49-62. , DOI 10.1037/0022-3514.91.1.49; Haidt, J., The emotional dog and its rational tail: A social intuitionist approach to moral judgment (2001) Psychological Review, 108 (4), pp. 814-834. , DOI 10.1037//0033-295X.108.4.814; Haidt, J., The moral emotions (2003) Handbook of Affective Sciences, pp. 852-870. , R.

Building on Tamborini's (2011) Model of Moral Intuition and Media Enjoyment, several issues are raised: First, the difficulty of conceptually and empirically defining ""morality"" in media entertainment is elaborated. Several options of moral ambiguity arising from the narrative structure of a story are sketched. Then, the link between processing moral content and positive media experiences such as enjoyment and appreciation is considered. Finally, issues of effects, especially on the long-term, are raised and implications for empirical questions are discussed.",entertainment; moral ambiguity; moral intuition; narrative engagement; narrative structure,,,,,,,,,"Bilandzic, H., Busselle, R.W., Transportation and transportability in the cultivation of genre-consistent attitudes and estimates (2008) Journal of Communication, 58, pp. 508-529; Bilandzic, H., Hastall, M., Talking about Big Brother: Interpersonal communication about a controversial television format Reality Television: Merging the Global and the Local., , (in press).

Starting from a background of well-established theories that have been proposed and elaborated mainly by Zillmann and his collaborators since the 1980s, a new two-factor model of entertainment is introduced. This model encompasses ""enjoyment"" and ""appreciation"" as two independent factors. In addition, several open questions regarding cultural differences in humans' responses to entertainment products or the usefulness of various theoretical concepts like ""presence,"" ""identification, "" or ""transportation"" are also discussed. Finally, the question of why media users are seeking entertainment is brought to the forefront, and a possibly relevant need such as the ""search for meaningfulness"" is mentioned as a possible major candidate for such an explanation.",appreciation; enjoyment; entertainment; meaningfulness,,,,,,,,,"Brock, T.C., Green, M.C., Strange, J.J., Insights and research implications: Epilogue to Narrative Impact (2002) Narrative Impact: Social and Cognitive Foundations, pp. 343-354. , T.

Feelings reflect an appraisal of everyday events or media products that shape our experience of pleasure and interest which are complementary. Pleasure can result from the meaningful interpretation of a program or from positive associations that it evokes. Interest in a program can result from intellectual engagement and a search for meaning or simply to alleviate boredom. According to a reactive model of media involvement, a person selects stimuli which modulate feelings of pleasure or excitement. This affective covariation process is superficial in the sense that there is no need for deep processing in order to determine the value of the stimulus. Emotions are more closely tied to the self and the meaning of social situations. Emotion can be related to a reflective model of aesthetic involvement whereby a person interprets the work in terms of relevant aesthetic knowledge and personal life experiences. This search for underlying layers of meaning leads to deeper aesthetic engagement and emotional elaboration. The main point here is that processes related to the experience of feelings and emotions run concurrently. Feelings reflect more global responses to events involving characters and plots. Emotions are more firmly grounded in the search for meaning in depicted situations and implicate the lives of audiences who watch the programs.",culture; emotion; interest; media; pleasure; self,,,,,,,,,"Arnheim, R., The other Gustav Theodor Fechner (1985) A Century of Psychology As Science, pp. 856-865. , S.Koch & D.

To those ends, the first section provides a conceptualization of appreciation in which we outline how we are using the term and how it is distinct from questions of emotional valence. The second section discusses the types of entertainment portrayals and depictions that we believe are most likely to elicit feelings of appreciation. Here, we suggest that appreciation is most evident for meaningful portrayals that focus on human virtue and that inspire audiences to contemplate questions concerning life's purpose. In the final section we consider the affective and cognitive components of appreciation, arguing that mixed-affective responses (rather than bi-polar conceptualizations of affective valence) better capture the experience of appreciation and its accompanying feelings states such as inspiration, awe, and tenderness.",appreciation; elevation; gratification; meaningfulness; virtue,,,,,,,,,"Algoe, S.B., Haidt, J., Witnessing excellence in action: The ""other-praising"" emotions of elevation, gratitude, and admiration (2009) The Journal of Positive Psychology, 4, pp. 105-127; Bartsch, A., Vorderer, P., Mangold, R., Viehoff, R., Appraisal of emotions in media use: Toward a process model of meta-emotion and emotion regulation (2008) Media Psychology, 11, pp. 7-27; Ersner-Hershfield, H., Mikels, J.A., Sullivan, S.J., Carstensen, L.L., Poignancy: Mixed emotional experience in the face of meaningful endings (2008) Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 94, pp. 158-167; Haidt, J., Elevation and the positive psychology of morality (2003) Flourishing: Positive Psychology and the Life Well-lived, pp. 275-289. , C.

Morality no doubt influences and to a certain extent governs our emotional responses to media, with the stories we chose to consume, the characters we love and hate, the rationale behind those feelings, the emotions that we experience on their behalf, and the pleasure and meaning comes as a result. Specifically, as media consumers, we experience emotional reactions to characters (liking), to their plights (anticipatory emotions), and to their ultimate outcomes (enjoyment and appreciation). Each of these emotional reactions are regulated by morality: character liking by moral judgments about the behaviors and motivations of characters, anticipatory emotions by sense of expected justice restoration, and enjoyment by the moral evaluation of the actual outcome portrayed in relation to the expected outcome. These processes and relationships are discussed in light of recent work on moral intuition, moral emotions, and moral disengagement.",affective disposition theory; enjoyment; moral disengagement; moral emotions; morality,,,,,,,,,"Appel, M., Fictional narratives cultivate just-world beliefs (2008) Journal of Communication, 58, pp. 62-83; Bandura, A., (1986) Social Foundations of Thought and Action: A Social Cognitive Theory., , Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice-Hall; Bandura, A., Social cognitive theory of moral thought and action (1991) Handbook of Moral Behavior and Development: Theory, Research and Applications, 1, pp. 71-129. , W.

However, newer research shows gains by female players, especially in online games. Therefore, how gamers perceive the masculinity of other gamers in game has become relevant. Two experiments examine how two variables - game genre and player skill - inform gender perception in online games. Results from both studies show that game genre is a salient cue for gender perception, but that perception of player skill is not. A number of gender differences in perceptions of player skill and the relationship between genre and perceptions of player masculinity are also identified. These findings are an important first step in understanding the perception of others in online entertainment environments. © 2010 Hogrefe Publishing.",avatar; game play; gender; online games; perception,,,,,,,,,"Behm-Morawitz, E., Mastro, D., The effects of the sexualization of female video game characters on gender stereotyping and female self-concept (2009) Sex Roles, 61, pp. 808-823; Biernat, M., Stereotypes and shifting standards (2009) Handbook of Prejudice, Stereotyping, and Discrimination, pp. 137-149. , T.D.

This paper presents the findings of the impact of smaller video format (specifically the Apple iPod), media content, and sound delivery on audience responses. The 2 × 2 × 2 experimental design varied screen size, content, and sound delivery. Participants were exposed to one of two presentations either on an iPod or on a 32 inch (81.2 centimeters) television with sound being supplied by either speakers or a headset. Participants saw either a 10-minute fast-paced (multiple cut) action sequence or a 10-minute slow-paced (long cut) conversation sequence from a feature length motion picture. The effects of differences in immersion, spatial presence, and social realism were measured. Screen size impacted reported sensations of spatial presence with subjects who viewed larger screens reporting higher levels. Subjects with headphone delivery reported higher levels of immersion than subjects with speaker delivery. Furthermore, several interactions between screen size, content pace, and sound delivery were found. © 2010 Hogrefe Publishing.",iPod; pace; screen size; sound delivery; telepresence,,,,,,,,,"Bente, G., Virtual gestures: Analyzing social presence effects of computer-mediated and computer-generated nonverbal behavior (2002) Fifth Annual International Presence Workshop, , October Porto, Portugal; Berry, R., Will the iPod kill the Radio Star?

A total of 40 children, half of them aged 6, the other half 8, were shown a film about sugar production. After one week, the children took part in a memory test on the film's content with free recall, cued recall, and recognition. In a second session, four working memory and attention tasks were administered. Results reveal that individual differences in domain-specific working memory skills account for substantial variance in the learning outcome, whereas children's age was no significant predictor. Findings are discussed in terms of cognitive processes underlying learning through films. © 2010 Hogrefe Publishing.",children; cognitive skills; individual differences; learning; media,,,,,,,,,"Alloway, T.P., Gathercole, S.E., Adams, A.-M., Willis, C., Eaglen, R., Lamont, E., Working memory and phonological awareness as predictors of progress toward early learning goals at school entry (2005) British Journal of Developmental Psychology, 23, pp. 417-426; Baker-Ward, L., Ornstein, P., Gordon, B., Follmer, A., Clubb, P., How shall a thing be coded?

So far, research has focused on biased content rather than style in reporting about minorities. One such stylistic dimension is the so-called linguistic intergroup bias: The tendency to describe positive behavior of members of one's own group and negative behavior of other groups' members in a more abstract way (compared to the same behavior of the respective other group). Recipients of communication biased in this way judge the described individuals in line with abstract descriptions (i.e., own-group members more positively than members of other groups). The current study demonstrates that linguistically biased news reports about minorities lead to higher levels of prejudice. Hence, media coverage does not only affect attitudes about minorities by what is reported, but also by how it is presented. © 2010 Hogrefe Publishing.",linguistic abstractness; migrants; news; prejudice,,,,,,,,,"Barreto, M., Ellemers, N., The perils of political correctness: Men's and women's responses to old-fashioned and modern sexist views (2005) Social Psychology Quarterly, 68, pp. 75-88; Carnaghi, A., Maass, A., Gresta, S., Bianchi, M., Cadinu, M., Arcuri, L., Nomina sunt omina: On the inductive potential of nouns and adjectives in person perception (2008) Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 94, pp. 839-859; Dixon, T.L., Crime news and racialized beliefs: Understanding the relationship between local news viewing and perceptions of African Americans and crime (2008) Journal of Communication, 58, pp. 106-125; Dixon, T.L., Azocar, C.L., Priming crime and activating Blackness: Understanding the psychological impact of the overrepresentation of Blacks as lawbreakers on television news (2007) Journal of Communication, 57, pp. 229-253; Dixon, T.L., Linz, D., Race and the misrepresentation of victimization on local television news (2000) Communication Research, 27, pp. 547-573; Donsbach, W., Klett, B., Subjective objectivity.

According to social agency theory, the presentation of social cues (the image and voice of the agent) may prime the social interaction schema and cause the learner to deeply process the learning material. Research on pedagogical agents focuses mainly on either the role of the presence of pedagogical agents, by comparing agent and no-agent groups, or on the design of the character, by comparing different agent groups. This article takes a comprehensive view combining both approaches in order to answer the question of how pedagogical agents should be designed so as to promote learner motivation and learning. It is argued that not only the mere presence, but also the valence of the social cues presented plays a decisive role. Two experiments examine the role of the perceived appeal of a pedagogical agent's appearance and voice. The results of Experiment 1 indicate that pedagogical agents may promote transfer performance, but only if they are appealing in appearance. The mere inclusion of a pedagogical agent yielded no effect on motivation or learning. Experiment 2 suggests that a high appeal of the pedagogical agent's appearance and voice promoted transfer performance. However, this advantage did not occur when compared to a control group without an agent. The presentation of two unappealing social cues (appearance and voice) even harmed transfer. This result suggests an important modification of social agency theory. © 2010 Hogrefe Publishing.",Appeal; Appearance; Learning; Motivation; Pedagogical agent; Social cue; Voice,,,,,,,,,"Atkinson, R.K., Optimizing learning from examples using animated pedagogical agents (2002) Journal of Educational Psychology, 94, pp. 416-427; Atkinson, R.K., Mayer, R.E., Merril, M.M., Fostering social agency in multimedia learning: Examining the impact of an agent's voice (2005) Contemporary Educational Psychology, 30, pp. 117-139; Baylor, A.L., Kim, Y., Simulating instructional roles through pedagogical agents (2005) International Journal of Artificial Intelligence in Education, 15 (1), pp. 95-115; Baylor, A.L., Ryu, J., The effects of image and animation in enhancing pedagogical agent persona (2003) Journal of Educational Computing Research, 28, pp. 373-395; Bendel, O., (2003) Pädagogische Agenten im Corporate E-Learning, , [Pedagogical agents in corporate e-learning].

College students learned about astronomy either without an agent's image or with an agent under one of the following conditions: a static agent (S), an agent with deictic movements (D), an agent with facial expressions (E), or an agent with both deictic movements and facial expressions (DE). Group S outperformed group E on a comprehension test, but no other differences were found on students' learning or perceptions. The results show that the presence of the studied agent - regardless of nonverbal abilities - did not produce at least a moderate effect size. Further, a static version of the agent was preferable to one with only facial expressions. © 2010 Hogrefe Publishing.",Embodied agents; Multimedia; Nonverbal communication; Pedagogical agents; Social presence,,,,,,,,,"Atkinson, R.K., Optimizing learning from examples using pedagogical agents (2002) Journal of Educational Psychology, 94, pp. 416-427; Bailenson, J.N., Swinth, K., Hoyt, C., Persky, S., Dimov, A., Blascovich, J., The independent and interactive effects of embodied-agent appearance and behavior on self-report, cognitive, and behavioral markers of copresence in immersive virtual environments (2005) Presence: Teleoperators and Virtual Environments, 14, pp. 379-393; Barab, S.A., Hay, K.E., Barnett, M.G., Keating, T., Virtual solar system project: Building understanding through model building (2000) Journal of Research in Science Teaching, 37, pp. 719-756; Baylor, A.L., Intelligent agents as cognitive tools for education (1999) Educational Technology, 39 (2), pp. 36-40; Baylor, A.L., Agent-based learning environments for investigating teaching and learning (2002) Journal of Educational Computing Research, 26, pp. 249-270; Baylor, A.L., Kim, S., The effects of agent nonverbal communication on procedural and attitudinal learning outcomes (2008) IVA 2008: LNAI 5208, pp. 208-214. , H.

What has not been analyzed, however, is whether an agent can have indirect effects when it is employed as a tutor for learning strategies rather than directly teaching the relevant learning material. In a between-subjects design (N= 45) we compared two different kinds of pedagogical agents - a cartoon-like rabbit and a realistic anthropomorphic agent - with a control group that was not tutored by an animated agent but was informed by voice only. Results showed no clear advantages for the agents compared to voice-based tutoring with regard to indirect learning effects, but they did demonstrate that the appearance of the agent matters. The rabbit-like agent was not only preferred, but people exposed themselves longer to the tutoring session when the rabbit provided feedback. © 2010 Hogrefe Publishing.",E-learning; Pedagogical agents; Physical appearance; Self-regulated learning,,,,,,,,,"Atkinson, R.K., Optimizing learning from examples using animated pedagogical agents (2002) Journal of Educational Psychology, 94, pp. 416-427; Bailenson, J.N., Beall, A.C., Blascovich, J., Weisbuch, M., Raimmundo, R., Intelligent agents who wear your face: Users' reactions to the virtual self (2001) Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence, 2190, pp. 86-99; Bailenson, J.N., Swinth, K.R., Hoyt, C.L., Persky, S., Dimov, A., Blascovich, J., The independent and interactive effects of embodied agent appearance and behavior on self-report, cognitive, and behavioral markers of copresence in Immersive Virtual Environments (2005) PRESENCE: Teleoperators and Virtual Environments, 14, pp. 379-393; Baylor, A.L., Permutations of control: Cognitive considerations for agent-based learning environments (2001) Journal of Interactive Learning Research, 12, pp. 403-425; Baylor, A.L., The impact of pedagogical agents image on affective outcomes International Conference on Intelligent User Interfaces, , 2005 January San Diego, CA; Baylor, A.L., Ryu, J., The effects of image and animation in enhancing pedagogical agent (2003) Journal of Educational Computing Research, 28, pp. 373-394; Bendel, O., Merkmale, Ziele und Funktionen pädagogischer Agenten [Attributes, goals and features of pedagogical agents] (2004) Informationen Zwischen Kultur und Marktwirtschaft.

Novice students learned about electrical circuit analysis with an agent-based instructional program that included circuit diagrams and the corresponding Cartesian graphs. For some students, attention to relevant parts of the display was guided by an animated arrow (A group) or the deictic movements of a pedagogical agent (P group). A control (C) group learned with no visual attention-guiding method. Group P outperformed groups C and A on a posttest and gave lower difficulty ratings than group C. The findings suggest that a promising function of APAs is to support students' cognitive processing during learning. © 2010 Hogrefe Publishing.",Animated pedagogical agents; Attention; Learning; Persona hypothesis,,,,,,,,,"Ainsworth, S., DeFT: A conceptual framework for considering learning with multiple representations (2006) Learning and Instruction, 16, pp. 183-198; Ainsworth, S., Van Labeke, N., Multiple forms of dynamic representation (2004) Learning and Instruction, 14, pp. 241-255; Atkinson, R.K., Optimizing learning from examples using pedagogical agents (2002) Journal of Educational Psychology, 94, pp. 416-427; Baddeley, A., Working memory (1992) Science, 255, pp. 556-559; Baker, S., Gersten, R., Dimino, J.A., Griffiths, R., The sustained use of research-based instructional practice: A case study of peer-assisted learning strategies in mathematics (2005) Remedial and Special Education, 25, pp. 5-24; Bandura, A., (1997) Self-efficacy: The Exercise of Control, , Freeman New York; Baylor, A.L., Ryu, J., Does the presence of image and animation enhance pedagogical agent persona?

The challenge for present and future PSI research is to provide measurement standards that are generated, confirmed, and validated across several studies. The present contribution tries to take a first step in this direction by exploring PSI with (1) nonmediated fictional characters (theater), (2) mediated fictional characters (soaps), and (3) mediated nonfictional characters (quiz shows). All three studies are based on the same theory (Two-Level Model of PSI) and on parts of the same corresponding measurement tool (PSI-Process Scales). All in all, the PSI-Process Scales show high usability in all three contexts, with the option to select PSI dimensions and items with respect to the study's focus. Even in a theater play, the PSI-Process Scales could be applied without any problems and without any changes in the item wordings. The results of the three studies offer new insights into the importance of specific user and persona characteristics for the constitution and intensity of PSI in different media genres. © 2010 Hogrefe Publishing.",comparative studies; media characters; parasocial interaction; parasocial relationship; scale,,,,,,,,,"Auter, P.J., Palmgreen, P., Development and validation of a parasocial interaction measure: The audience-persona interaction scale (2000) Communication Research Reports, 17, pp. 79-89; Caughey, J.L., Social relations with media figures (1986) Inter/Media.

The present study manipulates an avatar's pupil size, eyeblink frequency, and the viewing angle to investigate whether nonverbal visual characteristics are responsible for the impression made. We assessed how participants (N= 56) evaluate these avatars in terms of different attributes. The findings show that avatars with large pupils and slow eye blink frequency are perceived as more sociable and more attractive. Compared to avatars seen in full frontal view or from above, avatars seen from below were rated as most sociable, self-confident, and attractive. Moreover, avatars' pupil size and eyeblink frequency escape the viewer's conscious perception but still influence how people evaluate them.

In a 2 (Structure) × 2 (Story) × 2 (Sex) mixed design, participants read two inverted pyramid and two chronological news stories, each on a different topic. Dependent measures included secondary task reaction times (STRTs), cued recall, recognition accuracy, and text comprehension. Women had slower reaction times than men across stories, but a significant interaction showed their use of cognitive resources was less affected by variations in story structure. These results are discussed in the context of a comprehensibility interpretation of the STRT measure. The findings suggest that the common use of the inverted pyramid structure, which has been criticized as difficult to comprehend, may not explain the decrease in female news readers. © 2010 Hogrefe Publishing.",cognitive processing; limited capacity model of motivated mediated message processing; news; reading; sex differences; STRT,,,,,,,,,"Aaronson, D., Watts, B., Extensions of Grier's computational formulas for A' and B' to below-chance performance (1987) Psychological Bulletin, 102, pp. 439-442; Ackerman, P.L., Bowen, K.R., Beier, M.E., Kanfer, R., Determinants of individual differences and gender differences in knowledge (2001) Journal of Educational Psychology, 93, pp. 797-825; Allen, L.S., Richey, M.F., Chai, Y.M., Gorski, R.A., Sex differences in the corpus callosum of the living human being (1991) The Journal of Neuroscience, 11, pp. 933-942; (1993) Ways with words: A research report of the literacy committee, , American Society of Newspaper Editors, Author, Reston, VA; Armstrong, C., Writing about women: An examination of how content for women is determined in newspapers (2006) Mass Communication and Society, 9, pp. 447-460; Baron, R.M., Kenny, D.A., The moderator-mediator variable distinction in social psychological research: Conceptual, strategic, and statistical considerations (1986) Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 51, pp. 1173-1182; Britton, B.K., Tesser, A., Effects of prior knowledge on use of cognitive capacity in three complex cognitive tasks (1982) Journal of Verbal Learning and Verbal Behavior, 21, pp. 421-436; Britton, B.K., Graesser, A.C., Glynn, S.M., Hamilton, T., Penland, M., Use of cognitive capacity in reading: Effects of some content features of text (1983) Discourse Processes, 6 (1), pp. 39-47; Britton, B.K., Holdredge, T.S., Curry, C., Westbrook, R., Use of cognitive capacity in reading identical texts with different amounts of discourse level meaning (1979) Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Learning and Memory, 5, pp. 262-270; Britton, B.K., Muth, K.D., Glynn, S.M., Effects of text organization of memory: Texts of a cognitive effort hypothesis with limited exposure time (1986) Discourse Processes, 9, pp. 475-487; Britton, B.K., Westbrook, R.D., Holdredge, T.S., Reading and cognitive capacity usage: Effects of text difficulty (1978) Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Learning and Memory, 4, pp. 582-591; Chiu, M.M., McBride-Chang, C., Gender, context, and reading: A comparison of students in 43 countries (2006) Scientific Studies of Reading, 10, pp. 331-362; Clark, D.A., Steer, R.A., Beck, A.T., Ross, L., Psychometric characteristics of revised sociotropy and autonomy scales in college students (1995) Behavior Research and Therapy, 33, pp. 325-334; Cowan, N., Elliott, E.M., Saults, J.S., Morey, C.C., Mattox, S., Hismjatullina, A., On the capacity of attention: Its estimation and its role in working memory and cognitive aptitudes (2005) Cognitive Psychology, 51 (1), pp. 42-100; De Wahl, E., Schonbach, K., Lauf, E., Online newspapers: A substitute or complement for print newspapers and other information channels?

Additionally, the study tries to advance cultivation research by examining implicit attitudes (i.e., automatic affective reactions toward an object). A content analysis of four months of news coverage in one particular newspaper showed that foreigners were overrepresented as offenders and that the newspaper had a negative view of the EU. According to cultivation theory, it is assumed that the more people read a newspaper, the more their reality estimates and attitudes correspond to the most recurrent, stable, and overarching patterns of the newspaper's content. To test this hypothesis, a total of 453 students participated in a study that used a cross-lagged panel design with two waves and a time-lag of two months. Consistent with the cultivation hypothesis, those who spent more time reading the newspaper were more likely to overestimate the frequency of foreigners as offenders (i.e., first-order cultivation) and had more negative self-reported attitudes toward the EU (i.e., second-order cultivation). Additionally, those who read more of the newspaper showed more negative implicit attitudes toward the EU (i.e., implicit cultivation). The data show evidence of a significant causal influence of newspaper exposure on implicit attitudes, and a marginally significant causal effect on the overestimation of foreigners as offenders and on explicit attitudes toward the EU. The consideration of implicit attitudes as an additional dependent variable could advance cultivation theory and research.",cultivation; Implicit attitudes; Media effects; Newspaper,,,,,,,,,"Appel, M., Fictional narratives cultivate just-world beliefs (2008) Journal of Communication, 58, pp. 62-83; Arendt, F., Zur kultivierenden Wirkung der Kronen Zeitung [Cultivation effect of Kronen Zeitung] (2008) Medien Journal, 32 (4), pp. 3-21; Arendt, F., Explizite und implizite kultivierende Wirkung der Kronen Zeitung.

Dynamic graphs are animated graphical representations of nodes and edges representing mathematical structures used to model relations between different objects over time. After being tested on spatial imagination and linguistic thinking, 111 students had to answer twelve multiple choice comprehension questions about six interactive dynamic graphs while working with them. For each question, participants were randomly assigned to one cell of a 2 (with or without a scrollbar to adjust the presentation speed of the visualization) × 2 (with labels displaying all names of the currently presented nodes in the dynamic graphs or with tooltips displaying only one node name if the mouse cursor hovers over this node) factorial design. Scrollbars, which allow adjusting the presentation speed, were rarely used and did not foster learners' comprehension performance. Labels displaying all names of the currently presented nodes fostered learners' comprehension performance compared to tooltips. The higher the ability for linguistic thinking of the participants, the more their comprehension performance benefited from labels. These results are consistent with the cognitive-affective theory of learning with media.",Dynamic graph; Linguistic thinking; Multimedia learning; Pacing principle; Temporal contiguity principle; Zone of proximal development,,,,,,,,,"Atkinson, R.K., Renkl, A., Interactive example-based learning environments: Using interactive elements to encourage effective processing of worked examples (2007) Educational Psychology Review, 19, pp. 375-386; Ayres, P., Marcus, N., Chan, C., Qian, N., Learning hand manipulative tasks: When instructional animations are superior to equivalent static representations (2009) Computers in Human Behavior, 25, pp. 348-353; Baddeley, A.D., Working memory (1992) Science, 255, pp. 556-559; Baddeley, A.D., (1999) Human Memory, , Boston, MA: Allyn & Bacon; Bétrancourt, M., The animation and interactivity principles in multimedia learning (2005) The Cambridge Handbook of Multimedia Learning, pp. 287-296. , R.

Avatar-player similarity was hypothesized to determine identification with the avatar, which in turn was suggested to enhance the enjoyment experience. In a quasi-experimental study, (N = 666) participants were asked to choose the personality features of an avatar for six different game scenarios. The results demonstrate that the games' competitiveness as well as the participants' life satisfaction influenced avatar choice and identification. In noncompetitive games, similar avatars were created, whereas in competitive games, dissimilar avatars were created. Participants who were well satisfied with their lives created avatars that resemble themselves in terms of personality factors, whereas dissatisfied users created dissimilar avatars. Player-avatar similarity was positively related to identification. This correlation was significantly stronger for noncompetitive games. Identification with the avatar was strongly related to game enjoyment. When controlling for the influence of identification on enjoyment, player-avatar similarity was negatively related to enjoyment, suggesting that identity play can be an independent source of enjoyment in computer games.",Avatar; Enjoyment; Identification; Life-satisfaction; Video games,,,,,,,,,"Arbuckle, J.L., (2006) Amos(Version 7.0) [Computer Program], , Chicago, IL: SPSS; Asimina, V., Joinson, A.N., Me, myself and I: The role of interactional context on self-presentation through avatars (2009) Computers in Human Behavior, 25, pp. 510-520; Bem, S.L., The measurement of psychological androgyny (1974) Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology, 42 (2), pp. 155-162; Bentler, P.M., Comparative fit indexes in structural models (1990) Psychological Bulletin, 107 (2), pp. 238-246; Bessíre, K., Seay, F., Kiesler, S., The ideal elf: Identity exploration in World of Warcraft (2007) CyberPsychology & Behavior, 10 (4), pp. 530-535; Biocca, F., Intelligence augmentation: The vision inside virtual reality (1996) Cognitive Technology: in Search of A Humane Interface, pp. 59-75. , B.Gorayska & M.

Interestingly, positively valenced test stimuli are rarely used in this field, though they might provide useful information on the nature of the emotional response to virtual violence and its associative structure. According to the General Aggression Model (GAM) and its extensions ('citationReference id=""cr16-1"" rid=""c16""Carnagey', Anderson, & Bushman, 2007 'citationReference'), normal negative reactions to violence are expected. Alternatively, playing violent video games might be construed as engaging in positively valenced playful fighting behavior. To test the potential of violent video games to prime positive concepts, N = 29 adult males played either a violent or a nonviolent video game for 20 minutes and were subsequently tested in a standard lexical decision task consisting of positive, aggressive, nonaggressive negative, and neutral target words. The data show that the violent video game primed aggressive concepts as expected, but also raised positive concepts, and did so independently of the participants' history of playing violent video games. Therefore, the results challenge the idea that violent video games inherently stimulate negative concepts only.",Aggressive thoughts; Digital games; Play fighting; Priming of aggression; Rough-and-tumble play; violent video games,,,,,,,,,"Algom, D., Chajut, E., Lev, S., A rational look at the emotional stroop phenomenon: A generic slowdown, not a stroop effect (2004) Journal of Experimental Psychology: General, 133, pp. 323-338; Anderson, C.A., An update on the effects of playing violent video games (2004) Journal of Adolescence, 27, pp. 113-122; Anderson, C.A., Bushman, B.J., Human aggression (2002) Annual Review of Psychology, 53, pp. 27-51; Anderson, C.A., Carnagey, N.L., Causal effects of violent sports video games on aggression: Is it competitiveness or violent content?

The New Kids on the Block (NKOTB), one of the most popular musical groups in the late 1980s and early 1990s, abruptly disbanded in 1994. In 2008, after a 14-year hiatus, the band announced their reformation. Members of NKOTB blogged about their reunion on the group's website (www.nkotb.com), and a thematic analysis was conducted, using both deductive and inductive procedures, of 2,122 postings by audience members to these blog entries. Analysis revealed that audience members utilized, in various ways, both positivity and assurance maintenance strategies (Canary, Stafford, Hause, & Wallace, 1993). The results suggest that audience members enacted relational maintenance to express support for NKOTB and to demonstrate that they had remained committed to their parasocial relationship with NKOTB, despite the group's absence. These actions positively reinforced NKOTB's decision to reunite and conveyed fans' desire for NKOTB's return to be permanent. Thus, similar to actual social relationships, relational maintenance also functions within parasocial relationships and merits further research attention. © 2009 Hogrefe Publishing.",blogs; commitment; New Kids on the Block; PSR; relational maintenance,,,,,,,,,"Afifi, T.D., McManus, T., Hutchinson, S., Baker, B., Inappropriate parental divorce disclosures, the factors that prompt them, and their impact on parents' and adolescents' well-being (2007) Communication Monographs, 74 (1), pp. 78-102; Auter, P.J., Palmgreen, P., Development and validation of a parasocial interaction measure: The audience-persona interaction scale (2000) Communication Research Reports, 17 (1), pp. 45-56; Ayres, J., Strategies to maintain relationships: Their identification and perceived usage (1983) Communication Quarterly, 31, pp. 62-67; Bae, H.S., Lee, B., Audience involvement and its antecedents: An analysis of the electronic bulletin board messages about an entertainment-education drama on divorce in Korea (2004) Asian Journal of Communication, 14 (1), pp. 6-21; Bello, R.S., Brandau-Brown, F.E., Ragsdale, J.D., Attachment style, marital satisfaction, commitment, and communal strength effects on relational repair message interpretation among remarrieds (2008) Communication Quarterly, 56 (1), pp. 1-16; Bippis, A.M., Rollin, E., Attachment style differences in relational maintenance and conflict behaviors: Friends' perceptions (2003) Communication Reports, 16, pp. 113-123; Boyatzis, R., (1998) Transforming qualitative information: Thematic analysis and code development, , Sage, Thousand Oaks, CA; Brown, R., Hewstone, M., An integrative theory of intergroup contact (2005) Advances in Experimental Social Psychology, 37, pp. 255-343; Canary, D.J., Stafford, L., Relational maintenance strategies and equity in marriage (1992) Communication Monographs, 59, pp. 243-267; Canary, D.J., Stafford, L., Hause, K.S., Wallace, L.A., An inductive analysis of relational maintenance strategies: Comparisons among lovers, relatives, friends, and others (1993) Communication Research Reports, 10 (1), pp. 5-14; Chory, R.M., Banfield, S., Media dependence and relational maintenance in interpersonal relationships (2009) Communication Reports, 22 (1), pp. 41-53; Cohen, J., Parasocial breakups: Measuring individual differences in responses to the dissolution of parasocial relationships (2003) Mass Communication and Society, 6, pp. 191-202; Cohen, J., Parasocial break-up from favorite television characters: The role of attachment styles and relationship intensity (2004) Journal of Social and Personal Relationships, 21, pp. 187-202; Collins, L., This one's for the (former) children: New Kids on the Block, Donnie, Danny, Joey, Jordan and Jon set to return (2008) The National Post, , Retrieved on June 27, 2008, from the Lexis-Nexis Academic Database; Courtright, J.A., Millar, F.E., Rogers, L.E., Bagarozzi, D., Interaction dynamics of relational negotiation: Reconciliation versus termination of distressed relationships (1990) Western Journal of Communication, 54, pp. 429-453; Crabtree, B., Miller, W., A template approach to text analysis: Developing and using codebooks (1999) Doing qualitative research, pp. 163-177. , Crabtree B., and Miller W.

Both dubbing and subtitling may present specific advantages and disadvantages. In this study, the effects of these two methods on presence, transportation, flow, and enjoyment were investigated in an experimental approach. Participants (N= 154) watched a 30-min segment of a movie. Between-subject factors were translation method (dubbing without subtitles, dubbing with subtitles in a foreign language, and original language with subtitles) and genre (drama, comedy, and thriller). Findings indicate that subtitles in a foreign language decrease feelings of spatial presence, transportation, and flow. However, the difference between dubbing and subtitling failed to reach significance. No effect of translation method on enjoyment was found. The pattern of results is equal for all genres. Further analyses showed spatial presence, transportation, and flow to be related. In addition, transportation is more strongly related to enjoyment than flow and spatial presence. © 2009 Hogrefe Publishing.",dubbing; enjoyment; flow; spatial presence; subtitling; transportation,,,,,,,,,"Biocca, F., The cyborg's dilemma: Progressive embodiment in virtual environments (1997) Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication, 3 (2). , http://www.ascusc.org/jcmc/vol3/issue2/biocca2.html, Retrieved on March 3, 2005, from http://www.ascusc.org/jcmc/vol3/issue2/biocca2.html; Bocker, M., Muhlbach, L., Communicative presence in video communications (1993) Proceedings of the Human Factors and Ergonomics Society 37th annual meeting, pp. 249-253. , Santa Monica, CA: The Human Factors and Ergonomics Society; Bortz, J., Döring, N., (2003) Forschungsmethoden und Evaluation [Research methods and evaluation], , Springer, Heidelberg; Bosshart, L., Macconi, I., Defining ""entertainment.""

First, we provide a brief overview of the hardware and equipment used to create VR and review common elements found within the virtual environment that may be of interest to social scientists, such as virtual humans and interactive, multisensory feedback. Then, we discuss the role of VR in existing social scientific research. Specifically, we review the literature on the study of VR as an object, wherein we discuss the effects of the technology on human users; VR as an application, wherein we consider real-world applications in areas such as medicine and education; and VR as a method, wherein we provide a comprehensive outline of studies in which VR technologies are used to study phenomena that have traditionally been studied in physical settings, such as nonverbal behavior and social interaction. We then present a content analysis of the literature, tracking the trends for this research over the last two decades.

The study assesses the persuasive influence of such frames on the interpretation of news, and how issue involvement and attitude interfere in this process. A total of 282 participants were presented with one of three experimental versions of a newspaper article about asylum. In the first condition the asylum seekers were implicitly labeled as innocent victims, in the second as intruders. The third version is a mixed condition in which both competing frames were applied. In all three conditions an identical photograph was inserted. The findings indicate that the frame suggests how the photograph can be interpreted. However, no indications were found for a moderating role of the news readers' issue involvement or attitude. © 2009 Hogrefe Publishing.",attitude; frame competition; framing; issue involvement; news,,,,,,,,,"Barthes, R., (1977) Image - music - text, , Collins, Glasgow; Brewer, P.R., Framing, value words, and citizens explanations of their issue opinions (2002) Political Communication, 19, pp. 303-316; Brewer, P.R., Values, political knowledge, and public opinion about gay rights (2003) Public Opinion Quarterly, 67, pp. 173-201; Burgin, V., Looking at photographs (1982) Thinking photography, pp. 142-153. , Burgin V.

The data indicate that games are systematically used after exposure to stressful situations and strain, and that recovery experience is a significant facet of the gaming experience. Using structural equation modeling, the relationships among work-related fatigue, daily hassles, social support, coping style, recovery experience, and the use of video and computer games for recovery purposes were tested. Persons who associated stronger recovery experiences with game play used video and computer games more often after stressful and exhausting situations. In addition, participants' level of work-related fatigue and exposure to daily hassles were both positively associated with the use of games for recovery. Participants with emotion-focused coping style showed a higher tendency to use games for recovery than participants with problem-focused coping style. The relationship between work-related fatigue and game use for recovery purposes was moderated by social support. The stress buffering function of video and computer games was more important for participants receiving less social support. These participants showed a stronger relationship between work-related fatigue and the use of games for recovery than participants receiving more social support. © 2009 Hogrefe Publishing.",computer games; coping; entertainment; recovery; social support; stress,,,,,,,,,"Andersen, R.E., Crespo, C.J., Bartlett, S.J., Cheskin, L.J., Pratt, M., Relationship of physical activity and television watching with body weight and level of fatness among children: Results from the third national health and nutrition examination survey (1998) Journal of the American Medical Association, 279, pp. 938-942; Anderson, D.R., Collins, P.A., Schmitt, K.L., Smith Jacobvitz, R., Stressful life events and television viewing (1996) Communication Research, 23, pp. 243-260; Arbuckle, J.L., (2006) Amos (version 7.0) [computer program], , SPSS, Chicago; Ballard, M.E., Wiest, J.R., Mortal Kombat: The effects of violent videogame playing on males' hostility and cardiovascular responding (1996) Journal of Applied Social Psychology, 26, pp. 717-730; Bandura, A., (1997) Self-efficacy: The exercise of control, , Freeman, New York; Berkey, C.S., Rockett, H.R., Gillman, M.W., Colditz, G.A., One-year changes in activity and inactivity among 10- to 15-year-old boys and girls: Relationship to change in body mass index (2003) Pediatrics, 111, pp. 836-843; Bessière, K., Seay, F., Kiesler, S., The ideal elf: Identity exploration in World of Warcraft (2007) CyberPsychology and Behavior, 10, pp. 530-535; Brantley, P., Waggoner, C.D., Jones, G.N., Rappaport, N.B., A daily stress inventory: Development, reliability, and validity (1987) Journal of Behavioral Medicine, 10, pp. 61-74; Brosschot, J.F., Gerin, W., Thayer, J.F., The perseverative cognition hypothesis: A review of worry, prolonged stress-related activation, and health (2006) Journal of Psychosomatic Research, 60, pp. 113-124; Bryant, J., Davies, J., Selective exposure to video games (2006) Playing video games: Motives, responses, and consequences, pp. 181-194. , Vorderer P., and Bryant J.

Current empirical findings of media violence research on aggression are ambiguous. It is also unclear whether the positive correlation is due to active playing or to media reports. Media reports may lead people who do not play (nonplayers) to associate violent digital games with aggression, while active players (long-term players) may have differentiated knowledge structures. Therefore, we conducted an experiment to investigate the relationship between the concepts ""violent digital game"" and ""aggression"" for long-term players and nonplayers. Long-term players, nonprimed, and primed nonplayers performed two lexical decision tasks before and after playing ""Unreal Tournament."" While priming ""violent digital game"" activated the concept ""aggression"" for nonplayers, active playing had no impact at all. The individual knowledge about these games had stronger impact on psychological responses than playing a violent digital game. © 2009 Hogrefe Publishing.",aggression; associative networks; violent digital games,,,,,,,,,"Anderson, C.A., An update on the effects of playing violent video games (2004) Journal of Adolescence, 27, pp. 113-122; Anderson, C.A., Bushman, B.J., Human aggression (2002) Annual Review of Psychology, 53, pp. 27-51; Anderson, C.A., Dill, K.E., Video games and aggressive thoughts, feelings, and behavior in the laboratory and in life (2000) Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 78, pp. 772-790; Anderson, C.A., Huesman, L.R., Human aggression: A social-cognitive view (2003) Handbook of social psychology, pp. 296-323. , Hogg M.A., and Cooper J.

According to the desensitization hypothesis (Carnagey, Anderson, & Bushman, 2007), violent content may elicit negative affective responses and inhibitions, which in turn should interfere with performance. On the other hand, the players might understand virtual violent acts as a digital form of rough-and-tumble play, associated with positive emotions and mobilization, which in turn should raise performance. To test these competing hypotheses on game performance, N= 50 males with no prior violent gaming experience were exposed to three different versions of a custom-made video game in which the actions to be performed were identical, though they were audio-visually presented to appear either nonviolent, moderately, or extremely violent. The results show no indication of an initial inhibition of aggressive behavior, that is, performance is elevated and remains so if the action is presented audio-visually as being violent. This supports the notion that being involved in violent video game activity is perceived as an essentially harmless acting-out of playful fighting behavior. © 2009 Hogrefe Publishing.",desensitization; performance; play fighting; rough-and-tumble play; violent video games,,,,,,,,,"Anderson, C.A., Dill, K.E., Video games and aggressive thoughts, feelings, and behavior in the laboratory and in life (2000) Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 78, pp. 772-790; Anderson, C.A., Morrow, M., Competitive aggression without interaction: Effects of competitive versus cooperative instructions on aggressive behavior in video games (1995) Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, 21, pp. 1020-1030; Bartholow, B.D., Bushman, B.J., Sestir, M.A., Chronic violent video game exposure and desensitization to violence: Behavioral and event-related brain potential data (2006) Journal of Experimental Social Psychology, 42, pp. 532-539; Bösche, W., Geserich, F., Nutzen und Risiken von Gewaltcomputerspielen: Gefährliches Trainingswerkzeug, harmlose Freizeitbeschäftigung oder sozial verträglicher Aggressionsabbau?

It was predicted that participants who viewed advertisements of women posed as sexy young girls would score higher on the Child Sexual Abuse Myth Scale (CSAM; Collings, 1997) than participants in the two other groups.

On the basis of data from a three-wave panel study on the asylum law campaign in Switzerland, we show that the attitude change process can be modeled more appropriately relying on LGM compared to conventional procedures. Specifically, we demonstrate that LGM is likely to unmask media effects that were not obtained with conventional autoregressive fixed-effects models (ARM).

Based on results from the television-use survey, respondents' popular television programs (33 shows) were content-analyzed for amounts of verbal aggression. A measure called the Verbal Aggression Television Consumption Index (VATCI) was calculated for each individual by combining the results of the content analysis with participants' reported viewing levels. We examined the effects of various personality factors on the VATCI (both overall and by genre). Additionally, the relationship between the VATCI and risk behaviors was evaluated. Both sensation seeking and viewer aggression positively predicted overall VATCI and, in particular, VATCI for animated sitcoms and political satires. Overall VATCI was positively associated with risky driving, fighting, delinquency, alcohol drinking, and drug use. Implications of findings are discussed. © 2009 Hogrefe & Huber Publishers.",aggression; media content; risk-taking; sensation seeking; television viewing; verbal aggression,,,,,,,,,"Anderson, C.A., Berkowitz, L., Donnerstein, E., Huesmann, L.R., Johnson, J.D., Linz, D., The influence of media violence on youth (2003) Psychological Science in the Public Interest, 4, pp. 81-110; Anderson, C.A., Bushman, B., Human aggression (2002) Annual Review of Psychology, 53, pp. 27-51; Ang, I., (1985) Watching Dallas: Soap opera and the melodramatic imagination, , Methuen, London; Arnett, J., Heavy metal music and reckless behavior among adolescents (1991) Journal of Youth and Adolescence, 20, pp. 573-592; Bandura, A., (1986) Social foundations of thought and action: A social cognitive theory, , Prentice Hall, Englewood Cliffs, NJ; Bogaert, A.F., Personality, individual differences, and preferences for the sexual media (2001) Archives of Sexual Behavior, 30, pp. 29-53; Brunsdon, C., D'Acci, J., Spigel, L., (1997) Feminist television criticism: A reader, , Oxford University Press, Oxford, UK; Bushman, B.J., Anderson, C.A., Media violence and the American public: Scientific facts versus media misinformation (2001) American Psychologist, 56, pp. 477-489; Bushman, B.J., Stack, A.D., Forbidden fruit versus tainted fruit: Effects of warning labels on attraction to television violence (1996) Journal of Experimental Psychology: Applied, 2, pp. 207-226; Buss, A.H., Perry, M., The aggression questionnaire (1992) Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 63, pp. 452-459; Cantor, J., Harrison, K.S., Nathanson, A.I., Ratings and advisories for television programming (1997) National television violence study, 2, pp. 267-322. , Center for Communication and Social Policy, University of California, and Santa Barbara (Ed), Sage Publications, Thousand Oaks, CA; Chory-Assad, R.M., Effects of television sitcom exposure on the accessibility of verbally aggressive thoughts (2004) Western Journal of Communication, 68, pp. 431-453; Chory-Assad, R.M., Tamborini, R., Television sitcom exposure and aggressive communication: A priming perspective (2004) North American Journal of Psychology, 6, pp. 415-422; Comstock, G., Strasburger, V.C., Deceptive appearances: Television violence and aggressive behavior (1990) Journal of Adolescent Health Care, 11, pp. 31-44; Conway, J.C., Rubin, A.M., Psychological predictors of television viewing motivation (1991) Communication Research, 18, pp. 443-463; Coyne, S.M., Archer, J., Indirect aggression in the media: A content analysis of British television programs (2004) Aggressive Behavior, 30, pp. 254-271; Doljanac, R.F., Zimmerman, M.A., Psychological factors and high-risk sexual behavior: Race differences among urban adolescents (1998) Journal of Behavioral Medicine, 21, pp. 451-467; Donohew, L., Finn, S., Christ, W., ""The nature of news"" revisited: The roles of affect, schemes, and cognition (1988) Communication, social cognition, and affect, pp. 195-218. , Donohew L., Sypher H.E., and Higgins T.

Under the guise of a lyrical memory task, the experiment involved groups of participants who were randomly assigned to listen to an uncensored sexually explicit song, a censored version of the same song, a nonsexual song by the same artist, or no music. The lyrical content did not have a significant impact the participants' self-reported sexual attitudes and perceptions of peer sexual activity. Additionally, the music (or lack of) did not significantly alter attitudes toward premarital sex, perceptions of peer sexual activity, or attitudes toward women. The nonsignificant difference between the sexually explicit songs and the nonsexual songs challenges the psychological and lay theories that exposure to sexually explicit music instigates attitudinal change. © 2009 Hogrefe & Huber Publishers.",censorship; mass media; media effects; music lyrics; sexual attitudes,,,,,,,,,"Bandura, A., (1977) Social learning theory, , Prentice Hall, New York; Brown, J.D., Steele, J.R., Walsh-Childers, K., Introduction and overview (2002) Sexual teens, sexual media: Investigating media's influences on adolescent sexuality, pp. 1-24. , Brown J.D., Steele J.R., and Walsh-Childers K.

Pupils also become victims of verbal aggression (teasing, threats, insults, or harassment) in the context of internet chatrooms. The present study addresses the following questions: (1) How often does bullying occur in internet chatrooms? (2) Who are the victims of bullying in internet chatrooms? (3) What are the determinants of victimization in internet chatrooms? A total of 1700 pupils from various German secondary schools participated in the study. Results revealed a strong relationship between victimization in school and victimization in internet chatrooms; school victims are significantly more often chat victims. Furthermore, the predictors of chat and school victimization show both commonalities (gender, self-concept, child-parent relationship) and differences (social integration, popularity, and bullying behavior). © 2009 Hogrefe & Huber Publishers.",cyberbullying; online victimization; victimization; virtual aggression,,,,,,,,,"Austin, S., Joseph, S., Assessment of bully/victim problems in 8- to 11-year-olds (1996) British Journal of Educational Psychology, 66, pp. 447-456; Balci, G., Reimann, A., (2006) Gewaltvideos auf dem Handy.

We measured ballistocardiographic emotion-related heart rate responses with an unobtrusive measurement device called the EMFi chair. Ratings of subjective responses to the video stimuli were also collected. The results showed that the video stimuli evoked significantly different ratings of emotional valence and arousal. Heart rate decelerated in response to all stimuli and the deceleration was the strongest during negative stimulation. Furthermore, stimuli from the male actor evoked significantly larger arousal ratings and heart rate responses than the stimuli from the female actor. The results also showed differential responding between female and male participants. The present results support the hypothesis that heart rate decelerates in response to films depicting dynamic negative facial expressions. The present results also support the idea that the EMFi chair can be used to perceive emotional responses from people while they are interacting with technology. © 2009 Hogrefe & Huber Publishers.",dynamic facial expressions; emotion; heart rate; perceptual technologies; physiology; video stimuli,,,,,,,,,"Adolphs, R., Recognizing emotion from facial expressions: Psychological and neurological mechanisms (2002) Behavioral and Cognitive Neuroscience Reviews, 1 (1), pp. 21-62; Ambadar, Z., Schooler, J.W., Cohn, J.F., Deciphering the enigmatic face: The importance of facial dynamics in interpreting subtle facial expressions (2005) Psychological Science, 16, pp. 403-410; Anttonen, J., Surakka, V., Emotions and heart rate while sitting on a chair (2005) Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems, CHI 2005, pp. 491-499; Anttonen, J., Surakka, V., Music, heart rate, and emotions in the context of stimulating technologies (2007) Springer Lecture Notes on Computer Science, 4738, pp. 290-301; Aula, A., Surakka, V., Auditory emotional feedback facilitates human-computer interaction (2002) Proceedings of HCI 2002, pp. 337-349. , Springer, London; Bailenson, J.N., Pontikakis, E.D., Mauss, I.B., Gross, J.J., Jabon, M.E., Hutcherson, C.A., Real-time classification of evoked emotions using facial feature tracking and physiological responses (2008) International Journal of Human-Computer Studies, 66, pp. 303-317; Biele, C., Grabowska, A., Sex differences in perception of emotion intensity in dynamic and static facial expressions (2006) Experimental Brain Research, 171, pp. 1-6; Bradley, M.M., Codispoti, M., Cuthbert, B.N., Lang, P.J., Emotion and motivation I: Defensive and appetitive reactions in picture processing (2001) Emotion, 1, pp. 276-298; Bradley, M.M., Codispoti, M., Sabatinelli, D., Lang, P.J., Emotion and motivation II: Sex differences in picture processing (2001) Emotion, 1, pp. 300-319; Bradley, M.M., Cuthbert, B.N., Lang, P.J., Picture media and emotion: Effects of a sustained affective content (1996) Psychophysiology, 33, pp. 662-670; Bradley, M.M., Lang, P.J., Measuring emotion: The self-assessment manikin and the semantic differential (1994) Journal of Behavior Therapy and Experimental Psychiatry, 25, pp. 49-59; Bradley, M.M., Lang, P.J., (1999) International affective digitized sounds (IADS): Stimuli, instruction manual, and affective ratings.

The results showed that joyful facial primes elicited increased PA only for positively valenced messages, whereas angry facial primes prompted increased NA (fear) only for negatively valenced messages. In addition, high-arousal facial primes prompted increased PA only for high-arousal messages. Both joyful and angry facial primes may influence affective responses when the prime and message content are affectively congruent and when affective responses are measured in terms of PA and NA. When ethical issues are appropriately taken into account, suboptimal affective priming might provide a method to increase the effectiveness of different types of media messages. © 2009 Hogrefe & Huber Publishers.",emotions; facial expressions; negative activation; positive activation; suboptimal affective priming,,,,,,,,,"Bower, G.H., Mood and memory (1981) American Psychologist, 36, pp. 129-148; Cacioppo, J.T., Gardner, W.L., Emotion (1999) Annual Review of Psychology, 50, pp. 191-214; Clark, M.S., Milberg, S., Erber, R., Effects of arousal on judgments of others' emotions (1984) Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 46, pp. 551-560; Clark, M., Milberg, S., Ross, J., Arousal cues arousal-related material in memory: Implications for understanding effects of mood on memory (1983) Journal of Verbal Learning and Verbal Behavior, 22, pp. 633-649; Dimberg, U., Thunberg, M., Elmehed, K., Unconscious facial reactions to emotional facial expressions (2000) Psychological Science, 11, pp. 86-89; Draine, S.C., Greenwald, A.G., Replicable unconscious semantic priming (1998) Journal of Experimental Psychology: General, 127, pp. 286-303; Ekman, P., Universals and cultural differences in facial expressions of emotion (1972) Nebraska Symposium on Motivation 1971, pp. 207-283. , Cole J.

Ninety-two participants read three unpleasant news stories from a website. Half of the participants acquired their stories by searching, meaning they had a previous information need in mind. The other half of the participants acquired their stories by surfing, with no previous information need in mind. Heart rate, skin conductance, and corrugator activation were collected as measures of resource allocation, motivational activation, and unpleasantness, respectively, while participants read each story. Self-report valence and recognition accuracy were also measured. Stories acquired by searching elicited greater heart rate acceleration, skin conductance level, and corrugator activation during reading. These stories were rated as more unpleasant, and their details were recognized more accurately than similar stories that were acquired by surfing.

A total of 110 Germans were invited to a cinema and randomly assigned to the control group that filled in the relevant questionnaire before the movie, or to the film group that filled in the questionnaire after the movie. The film group reported fewer negative attitudes toward Hitler than the control group and saw the German population less as victims. Attitudes toward right-wing political parties and empathy, as well as demographic variables, exerted significant moderator effects. Results are discussed with regard to the public controversy concerning a potential trivialization of Hitler and National Socialism by the movie. © 2008 Hogrefe & Huber Publishers.",Adolf Hitler; demonizing; exemplification theory; media influence; National Socialism; Nazi Germany; personality moderators,,,,,,,,,"Adorno, T.W., Frenkel-Brunswick, E., Levinson, D.J., Sanford, R.N., (1950) The authoritarian personality, , Harper, New York; Aiken, L.S., West, S.G., (1991) Multiple regression: Testing and interpreting interactions, , Sage, Newbury Park, CA; Aust, C.F., Zillmann, D., Effects of victim exemplification in television news on viewer perception of social issues (1996) Journalism and Mass Communication Quarterly, 73, pp. 787-803; Baumeister, R.F., (1997) Evil: Inside human cruelty and violence, , Freeman, New York; Berger, R., Brodkin, H., Holocaust - The story of the family Weiss Television series, , Producers, 1978; Bergmann, W., Nicht immer als Tätervolk dastehen - Zum Phänomen des Schuldabwehr-Antisemitismus in Deutschland [Not always appearing as the population of perpetrators - About the phenomenon of antisemitism as defense against guilt in Germany] (2006) Antisemitismus in Europa und in der arabischen Welt [Anti-semitism in Europe an in the arabian world], pp. 81-106. , Ansorge D.

In doing so, we considered formal and content aspects of news reports as well as viewers' gratifications as independent variables. Analyses showed that violence in TV news elicits primarily negative emotions depending on the type of portrayed violence. Effects of presentation mode and of expected gratification on the viewers' feelings are traceable. On the whole, fear is neither the only nor the most prominent emotion; rather, viewers seem to react to violence with ""other-critical"" moral emotions, including anger and contempt, reflecting a concern for the integrity of the social order and the disapproval of others. Emotions shown in reaction to the suffering of others, like sadness and fear, occur much more rarely. The results largely show a complex web of relations between media variables, viewers' characteristics, and emotional processes. © 2008 Hogrefe & Huber Publishers.",emotional responses; motivation; news media; television viewing; violence,,,,,,,,,"Bryant, J., Vorderer, P., (2006) Psychology of entertainment, , Erlbaum, Mahwah, NJ; Cacioppo, J.T., Berntson, G.G., Crites Jr., S.L., Social neuroscience: Principles of psychophysiological arousal and response (1996) Social psychology: Handbook of basic principles, pp. 72-101. , Higgins E.T., and Kruglanski A.W.

The present study investigates such inferences while watching a narrative film and aims at clarifying the role of the musical leitmotif in supporting this process. Participants watched short segments from James Bond movies, which depicted situations that were likely to elicit a particular emotion in the main protagonist. The emotional reaction was not directly expressed by the protagonist but was shown on screen in a respective target sentence. In one condition (concordant), this statement matched the situation. In the other condition (nonconcordant), the statement indicated an antagonistic emotion. The reading times of the emotional target sentences were measured. After reading the target sentence, participants continued to watch the film clip by pressing a button. The results show that emotionally nonconcordant target-sentences led to longer reading times, whereas the musical leitmotif had no significant impact. © 2008 Hogrefe & Huber Publishers.",emotion; film music; inferences; situation model,,,,,,,,,"Boltz, M., Schulkind, M., Kantra, S., Effects of background music on remembering of filmed events (1991) Memory and Cognition, 19, pp. 595-606; Bordwell, D., (1985) Narration in the fiction film, , Routledge, London; Bordwell, D., Thompson, K., (1993) Film art: An introduction, , McGraw-Hill, New York; Brewer, W.F., Lichtenstein, E.H., Stories are to entertain: A structural-affect theory of stories (1982) Journal of Pragmatics, 6, pp. 473-486; Broccoli, A.R., Wilson, M.G., Cartlidge, W.P.

The study investigated the relationship between two dimensions of unwillingness-to-communicate (approach-avoidance and reward) and different motives of Facebook use. In addition, it examined the relationship between unwillingness-to-communicate and the behavioral and attitudinal outcomes of Facebook use (e.g., the number of hours spent on Facebook, duration of use, the number of Facebook friends, satisfaction with Facebook). Results of multiple regression analysis revealed that respondents who felt anxiety and fears in their face-to-face communication used Facebook to pass time and feel less lonely more than other respondents, but they had fewer Facebook friends. Overall, this paper finds evidence that people who are involved in online relationships are those who are willing to communicate in real life, rather than the opposite. Such results seem to justify the rich-get-richer hypothesis, which states that the internet primarily benefits extraverted individuals. Our results are in contrast to findings that socially anxious individuals are more likely to form relationships online. © 2008 Hogrefe & Huber Publishers.",Facebook; online relationships; unwillingness-to-communicate; uses and gratifications,,,,,,,,,"Armstrong, C.B., Rubin, A.M., Talk radio as interpersonal communication (1989) Journal of Communication, 39, pp. 84-94; Bonebrake, K., College students' internet use, relationship formation, and personality correlates (2002) CyberPsychology & Behavior, 5, pp. 551-557; Burgoon, J.K., The unwillingness to communicate scale: Development and validation (1976) Communication Monographs, 43, pp. 60-69; Burgoon, J.K., Hale, J.L., A research note on the dimensions of communication reticence (1983) Communication Quarterly, 31, pp. 238-248; Charney, T., Greenberg, B., Uses and gratifications of the internet (2001) Communication, technology and society: New media adoption and uses and gratifications, pp. 383-406. , Lin C., and Atkin D.

A diagnostic instrument, the Survey for the Assessment of Aesthetic Perception (SAAP), was developed in the German language to empirically assess these dimensions. Subsequently, the SAAP was implemented in two empirical studies, drawing on paintings and sculptures as visual arts stimuli. These studies provided evidence for construct validity, specifically factorial validity; the three esthetic processes of cognition, emotion, and self-congruency were distinguished. Also, internal consistency and test-retest reliability showed the SAAP to be strongly reliable. In sum, these results provide initial support toward the adequacy of the SAAP's psychometric properties. © 2008 Hogrefe & Huber Publishers.",esthetic perception; questionnaire; reliability; validity; visual arts,,,,,,,,,"Appel, M., Koch, E., Schreier, M., Groeben, N., Aspekte des Leseerlebens: Skalenentwicklung [Aspect of reading experience: Development of a scale] (2002) Zeitschrift für Medienpsychologie, 14, pp. 149-154; Berlyne, D.E., (1971) Esthetics and psychobiology, , Appleton-Century-Crofts, New York; Bryant, J., Vorderer, P., (2006) Psychology of entertainment, , Erlbaum, Mahwah, NJ; Bußmann, K., König, K., Matzner, F., (1997) Skulptur.

In this study, we investigated negotiation in a collaborative virtual environment. We focused specifically on communication channels and their impact on negotiation in three-person groups. Three conditions of media richness were varied in the collaborative virtual environment: text chat, audio channel, and a combination of both. Furthermore, various nonverbal signals and a function for taking notes were available to the participants in every condition. The results show that participants in the conditions with audio channel and with audio channel and text chat are more satisfied with the communication process and need less time to find a solution. The quality of the negotiated result does not differ between the conditions. Adding text chat to the audio channel does not enhance the potential of solving negotiation problems. Audio-based communication seems to meet the requirements of negotiating better than text chat in terms of a more satisfying and faster communication process. © 2008 Hogrefe & Huber Publishers.",collaborative virtual environments; communication channels; negotiation,,,,,,,,,"Adams, S.J., Roch, S.G., Ayman, R., Communication medium and member familiarity: The effects on decision time, accuracy, and satisfaction (2005) Small Group Research, 36, pp. 321-353; Allmendinger, K., (2005) Passung von Medium und Aufgabentyp: Der Einfluss nonverbaler Signale in desktop-basierten kollaborativen virtuellen Umgebungen [Fit between medium and task type: The influence of nonverbal signals in desktop-based collaborative virtual environments], , http://w210.ub.uni-tuebingen.de/dbt/volltexte/2005/1658, Retrieved March 24, 2007, from http://w210.ub.uni-tuebingen.de/dbt/volltexte/2005/1658; Arunachalam, V., Dilla, W.N., Judgement accuracy and outcomes in negotiation: A causal modeling analysis of decision-aiding effects (1995) Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes, 61, pp. 289-304; Baltes, B.B., Dickson, M.W., Sherman, M.P., Bauer, C.C., LaGanke, J.S., Computer-mediated communication and group decision making: A meta-analysis (2002) Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes, 87, pp. 156-179; Bazerman, M.H., Curhan, J.R., Moore, D.A., Valley, K.L., Negotiation (2000) Annual Review of Psychology, 51, pp. 279-314; Beersma, B., De Dreu, C.K.W., Integrative and distributive negotiation in small groups: Effects of task structure, decision rule, and social motive (2002) Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes, 87, pp. 227-252; Binder, J., Konfliktmanagement in multilateralen (2005) Verhandlungen [Managing conflicts in multilateral negotiations].

An inductive coding process was conducted using constant comparative methodology on 1700 postings in response to 10 of Cuban's entries posted on his blog (www.blogmaverick.com) during his time on the show. Three emphatic interaction categories emerge from data analysis: (1) emotional intensity, (2) devotion, and (3) consultation. The findings of the study suggest a parasocial interaction role reversal wherein media users are counseling celebrities rather than seeking advice from them; findings also suggest that emphatic interaction aids a fan's ability to maintain preferred representations of the celebrity. Both these findings are significantly influenced by the interactive features of computer-mediated communication (CMC), which provide the accessibility to directly communicate emphatic interaction to celebrities. © 2008 Hogrefe & Huber Publishers.",computer-mediated communication;

Recent theoretical and empirical considerations of homepages and Web 2.0 platforms show that impression management is a major motive for actively participating in social networking sites. However, the factors that determine the specific form of self-presentation and the extent of self-disclosure on the Internet have not been analyzed. In an exploratory study, we investigated the relationship between self-reported (offline) personality traits and (online) self-presentation in social networking profiles. A survey among 58 users of the German Web 2.0 site, StudiVZ.net, and a content analysis of the respondents' profiles showed that self-efficacy with regard to impression management is strongly related to the number of virtual friends, the level of profile detail, and the style of the personal photo. The results also indicate a slight influence of extraversion, whereas there was no significant effect for self-esteem. © 2008 Hogrefe & Huber Publishers.",online impression management; self-efficacy; self-esteem; social networking sites; Web 2.0,,,,,,,,,"Banczyk, B., Krämer, N., Senokozlieva, M., The wurst"" meets ""fatless (2008) MySpace.

A short murder story, divided into four segments, was presented to 154 participants. Complexity was manipulated as three-step factor through combinations of clues hinting toward either suspect A or B in the first three segments, while the last segment revealed the culprit. Readers indicated suspicions and enjoyment after each segment. Finally, respondents reported overall enjoyment and affective responses before completing the need-for-cognition scale. Results for enjoyment of the entire mystery and during reception show that higher complexity was generally enjoyed less. Furthermore, need-for-cognition affected enjoyment in curvilinear fashion overall, with medium need-for-cognition resulting in greater enjoyment. Respondents with high need-for-cognition were an exception in that they enjoyed medium complexity during mystery exposure the most. © 2008 Hogrefe & Huber Publishers.",complexity; entertainment; media usage; murder mystery; need-for-cognition,,,,,,,,,"Berlyne, D.E., (1960) Conflict, arousal, and curiosity, , McGraw-Hill, New York; Bless, H., Waenke, M., Bohner, G., Fellhauer, R.F., Schwarz, N., Need for cognition: Eine Skala zur Erfassung von Engagement und Freude bei Denkaufgaben [Need for cognition: A scale measuring engagement and happiness in cognitive tasks] (1994) Zeitschrift für Sozialpsychologie, 25 (2), pp. 147-154; Brewer, W.F., Lichtenstein, E.H., Event schema, story schema, and story grammars (1981) Attention and performance IX, pp. 363-379. , Long J., and Baddely A.

After inducing a state of low arousal, participants were assigned to experimental or control conditions via self-selection. Members of the experimental group played a computer game for five minutes; subjects in the control group spent the same amount of time awaiting further instructions. Participants who were exposed to the computer game showed significantly higher levels of arousal and performed significantly better on a subsequent cognitive task. The pattern of results was not influenced by the participants' prior experience with the game. The findings indicate that mood-management processes associated with personal media use at the workplace go beyond the alteration of arousal and affect subsequent cognitive performance. © 2008 Hogrefe & Huber Publishers.",arousal; computer games; media effects; mood management; task performance; workplace,,,,,,,,,"Ballard, M.E., Wiest, J.R., Mortal Kombat: The effects of violent videogame playing on males' hostility and cardiovascular responding (1996) Journal of Applied Social Psychology, 26, pp. 717-730; Bandura, A., Self-efficacy: Toward a unifying theory of behavioral change (1977) Psychological Review, 84, pp. 191-215; Bargh, J.A., Gollwitzer, P.M., Lee-Chai, A., Barndollar, K., Trötschel, R., The automated will: Nonconscious activation and pursuit of behavioral goals (2001) Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 81, pp. 1014-1027; Belanger, F., van Slyke, C., Abuse or learning?

This study used a 2 (Positive mood/negative mood) × 2 (High arousal/low arousal) within-subject design with 544 undergraduate students recruited from a large northeastern university in the United States. Results showed that happy films and high arousal films were preferred over sad films and low-arousal films, respectively. In terms of gender differences, female viewers reported a greater preference than male viewers for happy-mood films. Also, male viewers reported a greater preference for high-arousal films compared to female viewers, and female viewers reported a greater preference for low-arousal films compared to male viewers. Finally, high sensation seekers reported a preference for high-arousal films.

As an explanatory framework, an integrated model is proposed, linking the concept of (positive and negative) parasocial relationships (PSR) to the concept of affective dispositions as used in the affective disposition theory of drama. In the context of the popular sport of ""Formula 1"" racing, the hypothesized causal structure of the formation of suspense was tested in an empirical survey study. A structural equation model was calculated. Results show a significant influence of positive forms of PSR toward a favorite driver, either mediated by viewers' hopes for a positive outcome or influenced directly by the experienced level of suspense. While negative forms of PSR toward a disliked driver affect viewers' hopes for a negative outcome, they do not add to the level of suspense. © 2008 Hogrefe & Huber Publishers.",affective disposition theory; entertainment; Formula 1; parasocial relationships; sports; suspense,,,,,,,,,"Auter, P.J., Palmgreen, P., Development and validation of a parasocial interaction measure: The audience-persona interaction scale (2000) Communication Research Reports, 17 (1), pp. 79-89; Baldwin, M.W., Relational schemas and the processing of social information (1992) Psychological Bulletin, 112, pp. 461-484; Baldwin, M.W., Relational schemas and cognition in close relationships (1995) Journal of Social and Personal Relationships, 12, pp. 547-552; Boomsma, A., Hoogland, J.J., The robustness of LISREL modeling revisited (2001) Structural equation models: Present and future.

The exposure to media violence (total score) affected students' later violence (β = .28) and later violent delinquency (β = .30) more strongly than other risk factors. Direct effects were also caused by risk factors assessed at Time 1, which in turn were reinforced by the remaining risk factors on the second or third stratum of analysis. Of particular importance are the findings that (1) playing violent electronic games is the strongest risk factor of violent criminality and (2) both media-stimulated and real experiences of aggressive emotions associated with the motive of revenge are core risk factors of violence in school and violent criminality. The results of our study show that the more frequently children view horror and violence films during childhood and the more frequently they play violent electronic games at the beginning of adolescence the higher will these students' violence and delinquency be at the age of 14. © 2008 Hogrefe & Huber Publishers.",delinquency; longitudinal study; media violence; youth violence,,,,,,,,,"Anderson, C.A., Violent video games and aggressive thoughts, feelings, and behaviors (2002) Children in the digital age: Electronic media and children's development, pp. 101-119. , Calvert S.L., Jordan A.B., and Cocking R.R.
