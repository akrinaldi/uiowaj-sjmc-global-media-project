Method: Using content analysis, I examined the following features on the homepages of the Chinese university websites three times in three consecutive months: 1. political/national agendas, 2. history and tradition, 3. important people, 4. groups of people; and 5. campus views. Results: My three examinations indicate that the Chinese university websites consistently show certain aspects of the above five features, which serve rhetorical and social purposes: political and national agenda claiming authorship of website content, history/tradition justifying current status, important people guiding university work, large groups of people showcasing the CPC ideologies, and campus buildings and structures symbolizing social elites. Conclusion: Confucianism helps us discern patterns in the design of Chinese university websites. Despite its limitations, this study serves as a small window into the many relationships between Confucianism and Chinese university websites. © 2020, Society for Technical Communication.

Because digital messages via the Internet, cell phones, smart devices, and personal devices are typically shorter and more direct than traditional text-based communication, digital communication will necessarily improve via other, less textual cues. Visually, we already see this through the use of digital cues, such as emojis and graphical displays (e.g., GPS charts). But digital communication, in the future, will gain much from the expanded use of sound. As yet, no analytical framework for classifying sound in technical communication has been established. Method: The author revisits some historical uses of sound in technical communication before proposing a model for analyzing current and future sounds. Results: Tools that encompass signaling, linguistics, paralinguistics, extralinguistics, and rhetoric can be used to analyze complex sonic combinations and to generate new sounds for technical communication. Conclusions: A first model is proposed along with recommendations for the future. © 2019, Society for Technical Communication.

This article reports the results of an experimental study that examined whether signaling elements successfully guide visual attention of readers to relevant screenshot information as intended. A second goal was to find out whether visual signaling has a positive impact on how accurate and fast users execute the tasks which the screenshots support. Method: Two versions of a software tutorial were constructed that included screenshots with or without signaling elements. Participants’ eye movements were recorded while they studied the tutorial and executed the tasks described therein. In addition to eye movement measures, accuracy of task execution and time to complete the tasks were determined as measures of overall success on the tasks. Results: Participants working with tutorials that used visual signaling executed more tasks correctly. No differences were found regarding the time needed to complete the tasks. Analysis of the eye tracking data showed that participants fixated relevant screenshot areas longer and more often if highlighted by signaling elements. Conclusions: The results provide evidence that adding signaling elements to screenshots is an effective means to guide the visual attention of users. As predicted by the Cognitive Theory of Multimedia Learning, visual signaling does not simply increase interest in pictures but helps users to select relevant information. © 2019, Society for Technical Communication.

In this study, successful projects are defined as projects that reached their funding goal; failed projects did not meet their funding goal. Method: Content analysis of 25 successful and 25 failed technology project videos. Cross-cultural analysis of successful U.S. videos and non-U.S. videos. Results: • Successful project videos were more likely to include iconic and analytic still images and to demonstrate the final product; usually displayed a combination of static and dynamic pictures; and tended to use shorter on-screen texts. • All videos comprised at least one of the kairos subtypes. • Successful U.S. videos were more likely to present the creator onscreen, include static pictures and provide information on why the creator needed donations (logos). These also always referred to timeliness or a call to action (kairos). • Successful non-U.S. videos were much more likely to refer to the exclusivity of the product (pathos) Conclusion: Kickstarter project videos are an important feature on the main project page and may influence potential supporters’ decisions to fund projects. While other factors can also contribute to project success, an awareness of physical characteristics and rhetorical appeals of successful videos can help project campaigners, technical communication practitioners, and educators create more effective videos. © 2019, Society for Technical Communication.

This is especially true in locations where the public may not expect or understand the danger around them—such as amusement parks, national parks, or unfamiliar vacation spots. Although a number of factors influence the effectiveness of a warning, this study focuses specifically on the use of expository versus abridged language in warning signs. Method: This research was conducted in two phases. First, I distributed an online survey that was completed by 303 participants who were randomly assigned to view one of two warning sign options and then were asked to describe the sign’s meaning. Second, I conducted a content analysis of the survey responses using coding terms (related to Bloom’s Taxonomy) to assess the levels of understanding that resulted from the two warning sign versions. Results: My findings indicate that people who viewed a longer, more detailed expository warning from a national park were more likely to understand the risks and consequences as well as how to apply the information to new situations or specific actions. In other words, they demonstrated a higher level of understanding risks and risk avoidance. Conclusions: In public recreation and tourism spaces, detailed expository warning signs may be more effective at helping the public understand unfamiliar risks and how to avoid them. However, reading times (max. 30 seconds) and contexts (near resting/ standing areas) should be considered. © 2019, Society for Technical Communication.

Also, the study intended to help future researchers to better understand users’ experience in seeking technical help. Method: To contribute to this research area, I examined 18 help desk visits between 11 users and 6 technical support providers in an in-person help desk at a four-year university in the Midwest United States. I analyzed the communication for stages of the conversation in which the component devoted to diagnosing technical problems existed, closely analyzed the dialogue of both speakers during this stage, and explored associations between the communication strategies they used and the user satisfaction based on a customer-support satisfaction survey. Results: The statistical tests suggested that more dialogue about the users’ technical problem seems to associate with user satisfaction. The tests did not reveal a strong association between specific communication strategies and user satisfaction. The analysis of the visits showed how users shared their experiences through narratives and minimal responses, and how technical support providers used inquiries to understand user needs and experiences, providing a framework for understanding what the strategies look like. Conclusions: This research provides a reliable way of identifying and categorizing the ways two speakers communicate to diagnose a technical problem, which provides a framework for new technical support providers to communicate during this part of the discussion. © 2019, Society for Technical Communication.

Method: I located and gathered primary sources in the Navy’s safety campaign from archives, museums, and military and civilian publications, and then analyzed these artifacts according to the definition and attributes of transmedia storytelling in Jenkins (2007, 2011). Results: From my analysis, I found that the Navy’s use of the Dilbert myth combined multimodality with radical intertextuality in order to foster additive comprehension; it also employed a robust set of transmedia storytelling techniques. Conclusion: These findings suggest that transmedia storytelling was used to communicate technical information before the digital age and that the Navy’s Dilbert campaign is a potentially useful historical example for illustrating transmedia storytelling techniques. © 2019, Society for Technical Communication.

Method: This article utilizes memetic rhetorical analysis to identify interface-and content-specific memes and to explore the connections between those memes that create environments to which some adapt successfully while other are lost. Results: My analysis shows that the interface memes that characterize the Whole30 Facebook Community page create a communicative situation in which personal experience is more likely to be persuasive than scientific research or institutionally conferred credentials. Conclusion: Technical communicators need to craft technical and scientific content to allow for transmediated community interaction that draws on the affordances of social media sites to maintain the integrity of information. © 2019, Society for Technical Communication.

The lines between the real and virtual blur as gamers create documents across various modes and genres. This study looks not just at what gamers within these participatory cultures create but also how and why they create it. Method: I used a multi-dimensional case study approach to analyze content from 10 game-related websites. I then applied content analysis and rhetorical analysis to explore what types of technical communication artifacts are created on gaming websites, how such artifacts are created, and how gamers use technical communication to rhetorically represent themselves both socially and professionally within their gaming communities. Results: I present three major findings: (1) a list of genres of games-based technical communication; (2) an analysis of why gamers create such materials, including motivations linked to personal connections, professional connections, reputation, and rhetorical exigence; and (3) a discussion of how gamers write technical communication in the context of their affinity spaces and participatory cultures, as well as the modes and media they use. Conclusion: Players in participatory cultures consistently create game-based materials as part of their social identities, stretching across modes and media to suit their rhetorical goals. To that end, we have much to learn by studying not just online gaming communities but, specifically, the technical communication artifacts these groups individually and collectively create. © 2019, Society for Technical Communication.

From the perspective of technical communication, this direct involvement is enacted across networks of participatory media artifacts: webpages, user forums, tutorial videos, images, and open source software. In this article, I discuss how these transmedia networks support user-driven innovation and what roles technical communicators might play in creating, curating, and maintaining them. As a case study of a transmedia network, I examine the Werkstatt Workshop, the online user portal supporting Moog’s Werkstatt synthesizer. Method: My case study employs discourse analytic techniques to show how the language of the Werkstatt Workshop is both descriptive and constitutive of an emergent social practice. To theorize roles for technical communicators, I draw on previous studies of user forums, open source software, and tactical technical communication. Results: Discourses circulating within the Werkstatt Workshop go beyond simply documenting system processes to construct a world in which network participants enact identities, form relationships, and reconfigure information across media boundaries. The open, participatory orientation of the network incentivizes information sharing and innovation, as users organize knowledge resources around a common set of technological problems. Conclusion: Emerging cultures of making and modifying present opportunities to technical communicators as content creators, network administrators, and critics, helping to construct, optimize, and seriously understand new, productive knowledge networks supporting user-centered production and innovation. © 2019, Society for Technical Communication.

Method: Using a qualitative case study methodology, this research examined LinkedIn’s public user profiles. One case study participant was selected, whose profile met the criteria of promoting personal branding via multiple media artifacts, using transmedia storytelling techniques, and networking inside a participatory social media culture. Results: In this case study, the participant, Jacobs, used multimodal composing and transmedia storytelling techniques on LinkedIn’s social media site. Sharing smaller narratives across different media, Jacobs invites participation from his followers as well as responses from him to his followers. Within this participatory culture, his posts often blur personal and professional topics of interest but still remain singularly focused on promoting his personal branding to a wider audience Conclusion: Young professionals are not turning to traditional resources for advice on how to establish personal branding. Instead, they are turning to a networked, social world and using multiple media and transmedia storytelling techniques to attract followers, connect to other professionals, and network with potential employers. © 2019, Society for Technical Communication.

Methods: Using an exploratory, mixed methods single-case study model, we analyzed discourse and technical communication practices in a community focused on designing and playing social deception games across a network of digital platforms, with an eye toward how administrators, designers, and players negotiated design challenges. Results: The amateur game design community observed here participates in professional design practices that can be mapped onto Eyman’s (2008) framework for technical communication in games. Communities such as the subject-participants in this study produce unique documentation tracing design processes in ways some professional studios do not (Sansone, 2014) and foreground user experience considerations in observable, archived discussions. Conclusion: Amateur game design communities are as interested in maintaining strong user experiences and balanced gameplay as professional studios, as indicated by this study, and may use similar tactics to achieve results. The comparisons allowed construction of a framework for comparing amateur and professional designs in terms of tech comm practices. For technical communicators who must understand and account for world-making processes, demonstrating how amateur practice may compare to professional practice opens up new potential sites of study in the service of constructing game design ecologies. © 2019, Society for Technical Communication.

[A] proposes an organizational model to support content intelligence, that incorporates distinct Content Strategy, Content Engineering, and Content Operations practices within an overall Content Services Organization (CSO). To achieve an effective return on assets as part of an overall content strategy, enterprise content teams should build a unified management approach under a coherent Content Operating Model (COM). Method: Content engineers at [A], the content intelligence service, evaluated publishing team structures and workflows across large-scale enterprise publishers, including in-depth investigations at seven of the largest global companies. The approaches advocated in this article are a result of the [A] findings and resulting recommendations from these in-depth analyses. Results: New practices are necessary across the enterprise, established within a continuum between Content Strategy, Content Engineering and Content Operations. A collaborative strategy and set of standards must be organized across authoring groups. Conclusion: Directed by a new Global Content Operating Model (GCOM), a Content Services Organization (CSO), powered by the triumvirate of Content Strategy, Content Engineering and Content Operations, provides a balanced and effective path for large-scale publishing organizations to embrace the intelligence revolution. © 2019, Society for Technical Communication.

The concept of incorporating motivational theories for achieving health outcomes has been accepted as a valuable element across industries including public health, mental and physical healthcare, financial wellbeing, and education. The author will demonstrate how integrating principles from Self-Determination Theory—a leading theory of human motivation—with content strategy practices can successfully engage and motivate people across digital self-service platforms, focusing specifically on health care. Method: At Mad*Pow, the design team, content strategy team, and behavior change team have implemented content strategy practices in digital interventions via websites and applications. The creation of a content strategy guides the communication frequency, delivery style, information, and channels/touchpoints in order to best achieve the same goals that behavioral science does in face-to-face interventions. The intervention is then built, tested, and launched, after which the team tracks success metrics. Results: The Mad*Pow team has since measured results from clients and consumers, and can show how behavior change methodologies—as implemented using a strong content strategy—positively impact outcomes. Conclusion: Target audiences can be effectively engaged through content strategy in a manner beyond what is available via print, digital design, or other methods. © 2019, Society for Technical Communication.

This article explains our content landscape, the rationale behind the development of a new visual method to represent that landscape, and the resulting analysis to support an overall content strategy. Method: We present a technique that we used to analyze our complex content ecosystem of technical content and our approach to develop a consistent content strategy across documentation sets for diverse, yet interrelated products. We analyzed approaches that describe content strategy tools and processes for websites and for content reuse at the topic level, but found those lacking in support for complex technical content. Using that background, we designed our own tool and processes to support content analysis and strategy at the publication level. We developed the concept of a deliverable map, a visual representation of our content landscape by product category. The deliverable map became a highly effective tool in our efforts to define, communicate, and sustain our content strategy. Results: Multiple deliverable maps show existing content and relationships, and provide opportunities for different levels of analysis and stakeholder engagement. This analysis supports development and maintenance of a content strategy that meets business goals and that drives content across multiple outputs. The deliverable maps communicate current state, show the evolution of deliverables, identify content issues, and guide future planning. Conclusion: While the content in a content strategy initiative is typically thought of as small topics or webpages, it can be traditional publications also, such as technical manuals. Established content strategy practices can be adapted and successfully applied to content at all levels of granularity to meet the unique requirements of the organization. Spreadsheets are often the primary tool for documenting current-state content and planning future strategy. However, replacing spreadsheets with visual maps can be a more effective approach for complex, interrelated content landscapes. The interactive map becomes an invaluable tool to help create, communicate, and sustain a cohesive content strategy. © 2019, Society for Technical Communication.

Our study explores workplace genre conventions in light of responses. Method: Using a grounded theory approach, we gathered data in two stages using a mixed-methods design of interviews and questionnaires. Results: Seventy-three percent of respondents indicated that their respective companies require greater than three quarters of salaried employees to produce formal workplace writing. Further, most respondents (92%) affirmed that prospective professional/ salaried employees are “almost always” adversely affected by poorly written materials. Respondents defined “poor writing” in prospective and new hires in a variety of ways. All respondents chose Email as a “daily genre of writing” that eclipses the popularity of any other genre. Applicants and new hires were perceived negatively if “formal” written email skills were absent. Conclusion: New hires’ genre convention mistakes are interpreted as lack of training or skill, or knowledge errors. We posit that novices must adapt to the company writing culture, learning the communicative threshold concepts as they would other aspects of company culture. We posit email has a new, descriptive grammar, altogether—a set of rules deployed in individual workplaces that may not carry over to the next employer. So, we propose that email be taught and recognized in workplaces as what we have termed a “chameleon genre,” a genre that does whatever its users want it to do. © 2019, Society for Technical Communication.

While organizations dedicated to democratic processes may enact power differently than conventional organizations, they may fall short of practicing equality. This article explains the differences in non-hierarchical workplaces, considers businesses where democracy is a goal, and argues for considering equality as a habitual practice, particularly when writing regulatory documents. Method: We conduct a review of the literature on non-hierarchical workplaces and organizational democracy, applying Jacques Rancière’s concept of equality to two examples (one using primary data collection and one using secondary data) of two cooperatives where organizational democracy is integral to the design of the business. Results: The literature review exposes an interest in mêtis (cunning, craftiness, flexibility) as vital to practitioner success in non-hierarchical workplaces; however, this article demonstrates that mêtis does not prevent inequality, even in organizations expressly committed to workplace democracy. Conclusion: Professional communicators need to consider equality not solely as a structural resource (as in rules, laws, policies) but as a habitual practice to cultivate alongside other characteristics and frameworks important to a professional communicator’s toolkit. © 2019, Society for Technical Communication.

While component content management (CCM) is committed to both cost reduction and quality improvement, it also presents several challenges to multilingual quality. In this article, I present approaches for constructing multilingual quality as a global TC metric. Method: This article relies on the results of two surveys, one conducted through technical communication venues and one through technical translation venues. Results: The surveys identified contradictions in the beliefs and practices of multilingual quality in CCM environments that led to problems with multilingual quality. I group the contradictions and problems with the help of the activity theory lens and, based on this grouping, present questions that global technical communication project teams can ask themselves to improve their work practices. Conclusions: Effective communication between stakeholders and the knowledge of end-users are the two prerequisites to creating high-quality multilingual information products in CCM environments. Approaches to multilingual quality need to be collaborative and highly contextualized—dependent on business goals, user needs, and available resources. Taking the lead in multilingual quality management is one area for technical communicators to add value to their organizations. © 2019, Society for Technical Communication.

This article discusses important characteristics of hypertext theory, developed over the last 70+ years, as a theoretical foundation that informs and defines the core competencies and practices of the field of technical communication. Method: This article initially reviews the significant literature on hypertext theory as well as recent selections, which help situate or define technical communication in the 21 st century. From this literature, we developed a framework to examine correlations between characteristics of hypertext theory and compared those to skills, processes, and products in technical communication. Results: Hypertext is a foundational theory which informs the processes and practices of contemporary technical communication, and in particular, core competencies in developing content, design, structure, and in the processes of information development and user experience design. Given technological evolutions, technical communicators continue to work with content informed by hypertextual theories and practices, to create multi-pathed, user-driven, dynamic experiences. Conclusions: Characteristics of hypertext theory have become essential parts of the core competencies required in the daily work of technical communicators. Furthermore, they can be used to describe our daily work as well as to help us frame professional development, certification programs, and identify as a field. © 2019, Society for Technical Communication.

This model is based on a narrow yet comprehensive set of 15 distinct information quality dimensions (based on previous research by Wang and Strong, 1996) that cover all categories of information quality – Intrinsic, Contextual, Representational, and Accessibility (ICRA). Research was done to determine which information quality dimensions readers rated as most important per category (as they related to documentation), which were then used to create a clear, comprehensive, and empirically based definition of documentation quality from the readers’ point of view. This definition of documentation quality is the heart of the model and provides a strong basis for measuring what readers want from the documentation we send them. Methods: Questionnaires were sent to readers, asking them to rate Wang & Strong’s information quality dimensions in terms of importance as they applied to documentation. Dimensions were sorted by information quality category, and the most important dimension per category (as determined by weighted average) was calculated. Results: According to readers, the following four information quality dimensions are the most important per ICRA category for documentation: Accurate, Relevant, Easy to Understand, and Accessible (AREA). Conclusions: We can use the AREA information quality dimensions to create a preliminary, focused, clearly defined, and reader-oriented model for collecting meaningful and actionable feedback that will improve documentation quality and increase reader satisfaction. © 2019, Society for Technical Communication.

Tatiana searches for the solution to this problem in the results of two surveys—one for technical communicators and one for technical translators. In analyzing the results of the surveys, When I started this project, my goal was to design the survey in a way that combines academic and industry perspectives and to keep the survey relatively consistent for technical communication and translation/ localization participants. To achieve this goal, I worked with the Center for Information Development-Management’s Research Advisory Board, which consisted of both industry managers and scholars. My initial research was sponsored by this organization’s grant. I also enrolled the help of several translation and localization scholars and project managers Tatiana also discovered that research efforts are always subject to the higher priorities of family responsibilities. She explains, My project was interrupted by a major life crisis—becoming a sole caretaker for my husband, who had to undergo multiple brain surgeries over a period of several months. While such a time of turmoil was definitely not suited for conducting a research project, the first survey was already completed and I was able to get the second survey designed and online. Focusing on my family, I kept this second survey open for longer than I originally planned—which, in the end, had the added benefit of getting more responses. And once the storm clouds cleared, I was happy to get back to the more “normal” activities of analyzing survey results—bit by bit. In the end, the survey method of data collection gave me the flexibility necessary to complete the project.",,,,,"Society for Technical Communication",,,,,00493155,,,,"English","Tech.

Complicating the issue are emerging technologies that threaten to “blackbox” and obscure the function of voting systems. In addition to discussing the longstanding issue of trust in voting technology, this article provides a review of useful macro-scale concepts for practitioners to consider when working on projects related to electoral systems. Method: After providing a synthesis and overview of the broad principles of electoral integrity, I overview blockchain (the technology underlying Bitcoin), discuss its possible application to voting systems, and consider its implications for the broader goal of fostering voter trust and legitimacy. Results: Technologies such as blockchain have the potential to not only change the mechanics of voting but to change the very definitions of “transparent” and “trustworthy” as applied to election systems. Conclusion: Trust in elections systems is ultimately a rhetorical, rather than technical, effect. As technical communicators are increasingly called upon to “unblackbox” election technologies, they must remain attentive to the potentially shifting values that define trustworthiness for the electorate at certain historical moments. © 2018, Society for Technical Communication.

Method: To manage the scope of the analysis, this project rhetorically analyzes three elections technology companies’ “About” pages. These “About” pages are the heart of a company’s digital ethos because they describe the mission, scope, history, and expertise of the company to its clients, customers, investors, and the public at large. Results: In addition to expected appeals to expertise, patriotism, and democratic values, these companies also created ethos through business profitability and the impartialness of technology to promote their products and democracy as a whole. Conclusion: An important part of building ethos among elections technology companies is done by appealing to business profitability and the impartiality of technology to promote democratic institutions. This contemporary strategy might reorient democratic discourse, values, and institutions themselves. © 2018, Society for Technical Communication.

I explore how Facebook’s UX/interface design has contributed to user engagements that have implications for the current political context within which we live and work. Method: I engage in a critical user interface analysis focusing on four key microinteractions on the site: browsing, reacting, commenting, and posting. Results: My analysis shows that Facebook’s user interface is structured around several design choices that create an ethic that prioritizes concision, speed, curation practices that limit divergent perspectives, and the flattening of complex identities and political commitments such that they are indexable, processable, and thus, monetizable. Conclusion: The analysis presented here considers the relationship between user experience design and political engagement. As such, this paper helps industry practitioners to see 1) how technology designs create new, mediated intimacies over time and 2) how those relationships have implications for user engagement with politicized content. © 2018, Society for Technical Communication.

Method: This article looks specifically at the 2017 Texas court case involving the 2011 district map involving districts 23 and 35. The article also analyzes the methods with which legislative mapmakers operate and deploy GIS software. Results: As previous researchers have noted, latinidad is often constructed in political and governmental documents within the United States to position Latinos as a threat to White Americans. Frequently, this constructed threat is mitigated by inflating the contributions of White Americans over their Latino counterparts. Yet, this examination of the 2017 court case illustrates that mapmakers can also utilize Geographic Information Systems to gerrymander districts and thus suppress Latino’s voting power to help White Americans maintain political power. Most worrisome is mapmakers’ deference to and citation of the Voting Rights Act to justify the creation of districts that account for and control electoral agency. Conclusion: The article concludes by asserting that technical communicators move beyond compliance in order to account for multicultural publics and to avoid engaging in similar technological practices. It also encourages technical communicators to become more active in identifying practices that threaten democratic integrity and in using their skills to promote more socially equitable electoral practices across their teaching, research, and advocacy. © 2018, Society for Technical Communication.

However, deploying technologies (broadly defined) as a way of interfering with voter rights is not a new phenomenon. Methods: In this study, we identified and located historical literacy tests (along with other related texts) that were used to disenfranchise black voters in the U.S. from 1890-1965. We conducted a critical rhetorical analysis of the documents using McCornack’s (1992) deceptive messaging criteria. Results: We found that even though the rhetorical and technical style and tone of the documents appeared to be objective and neutral, the literacy tests served as a technology of disenfranchisement, a way to oppress and marginalize, black voters. Conclusion: We argue that texts and technologies are not always designed with goodwill in mind and texts and technologies that are complicit in supporting and promoting oppressive practices have social, cultural, embodied, and material impacts on communities. We assert that technical communicators can look for possibilities and opportunities for resisting discrimination through texts. © 2018, Society for Technical Communication.

Method: Using a deductive coding method, I analyzed the 10 most-viewed beauty tutorials based on Swarts’ (2012) best practices for creating instructional videos and Mackiewicz’s (2010) assertion categories of expertise. Results: A majority of the videos followed best practices, such as including an introduction, beginning with a “promise” or a clear objective, incorporating verbal instruction, being strategically redundant, and using a combination of text annotations, audio, and/or still images to complement the video. However, a lack of confidence and quality in most of the videos suggest that the creators did not rehearse their scripts, nor did they use the recording and editing tools effectively. None of the creators seems to provide any reassurance to the viewers or promote a sense of their self-efficacy. In terms of asserting their credibility, the majority of the creators did not make any explicit assertions about their relevant role, product-specific experience, or familiarity with related and relevant products. Conclusion: Although best practices, such as having a clear objective and using verbal instructions, should be followed, instructional video designers should also consider additional factors, such as truthfulness and accuracy, accessibility, kairos, addressivity, personal narratives, and humor. © 2018, Society for Technical Communication.

One purpose is to convey a particular, non-Western perspective which can be considered alongside existing literature to highlight similarities and differences in different contexts. Method: A qualitative field study investigating the question, “What are some strategies and keys to communication that facilitate community engagement and stakeholder participation, especially related to issues of Agent Orange in Vietnamese contexts?” We interviewed 38 participants across eleven provinces in north and central Vietnam. Results: The organization studied cultivates community engagement by: • Conveying information through activities and experiences (experiencing information), powerful images (seeing information), and numbers (quantifying information) • Using that information to promote community engagement by reducing stigma and drawing upon a sense of responsibility Conclusion: The organization’s community engagement strategies are both similar to and different from those conveyed in existing research on community engagement practice. The purpose of community engagement prioritizes unity, not dissent—a major difference. But the organization is highly attuned to preserving human dignity a significant similarity. The organization intentionally hooks into cultural values to motivate community engagement using rhetorical strategies appropriate to the local context—a similar strategy—but those rhetorical strategies are rooted in different frameworks, requiring different sensibilities and tools than those typically used in Western contexts. © 2018, Society for Technical Communication.

This article discusses how a better understanding of audiences’ agency as they use natural history apps—i.e., their ability to take meaningful action—can help technical communicators develop more effective products. Method: I use interface rhetoric to examine key considerations of audience agency for natural history apps, focusing on five bird identification guide apps, part of a technical genre associated with historically established—though evolving—use practices. I analyze and discuss how the rhetorical choices of developers may empower audiences to understand nature or frame their interactions with nature in certain ways. Results: I identify three overlapping ways these apps function as interfaces for users: 1) to frame their audience’s experience of and relations to a body of natural history knowledge, 2) to model the conventions and practices of the birding community, and 3) to frame their audience’s understanding of the natural world as a whole. Conclusion: Approaching natural history guide app design with an awareness of the diverse ways in which these texts function as interfaces can help technical communicators facilitate different types of audience agency during the apps’ ultimate situated use. © 2018, Society for Technical Communication.

Some of these designs include an opportunity for practice. This study investigated whether the presence and timing of practice affected motivation and learning in video-based software training. Method: An experiment is reported with four conditions: video-practice (VP), practice-video (PV), practice-video-practice (PVP), and video only (V). For motivation, the study assessed mood states and flow experience during training. In addition, task relevance and self-efficacy were measured before and after training. Learning was assessed with several performance tests for trained tasks. In addition, a transfer test was administered. Results: The findings for presence of practice were mixed. Practice increased training time and led to more negative mood states during training. A clear advantage of practice was found only on the transfer test. The findings for timing of practice favored a sequence in which instruction preceded practice. Perplexing results were found for the PVP condition. The highest learning gains were expected for this condition, but, instead, this condition had the lowest performance scores on a practice test and immediate post-test. Conclusion: This study indicates that the design issue of whether or not to complement video-based software training with practice is more complex than it seems. © 2018, Society for Technical Communication.

Past studies have analyzed risk communication effectiveness from one of two frameworks: a textual approach (meaning is in the text) or a socio-cultural approach (meaning is external to the text). Some studies have merged textual and sociocultural approaches, yet none to date have merged both approaches with an analysis of usability and ethics, specifically. A more useful analysis would combine such approaches to examine the broader system that makes up risk communication, using distributed usability and what Spinuzzi (2003) called “integrated scope” with a lens on ethics. Method: I examine existing frameworks used to analyze risk communication and offer a merged framework emphasizing distributed usability, integrated scope, and an ethics of care philosophy for identifying communication deficiences. I use archival research to retrace a historical case of how artifacts were used in a communication system at an industrial setting when a fatal explosion occurred. Results: I use this historical case analysis to show that a merged framework with distributed usability, integrated scope, and an ethics of care philosophy provides a more comprehensive and concrete approach for identifying risk communication deficiencies and preventing injuries and fatalities. Conclusion: Examining complex work systems through this new merged framework expands our understanding of the interplay between textual-level components of our information (placement, accuracy, and details) and the social/cultural/political environments that define how workers act. Practitioners and researchers can apply this new merged framework to analyze past and current risk communication systems to identify usability deficiencies and prevent accidents. © 2018, Society for Technical Communication.

Method: We conducted a needs analysis informed by Spinuzzi’s (2013) Topsight, undertaken through over twenty hours of clinical observation, studying clinical communication practices by role in the clinic (provider, nurse, medical assistant, and front desk receptionist). Results: Delivering quality care that extends beyond the patient encounter (the face-to-face appointment) takes a highly coordinated team. Although the Center’s schedule was set up for teams, the work environment was not well coordinated except where individual providers were more team-oriented. Conclusion: An Agile team approach to communicating may be an effective intervention for primary care clinics. Researchers in TPC and UX can usefully contribute to these kinds of inquiry projects in clinical settings, as our research methods offer viewpoints not visible to clinicians alone. © 2018, Society for Technical Communication.

Since project work is episodic, project professionals rarely have opportunity to reflect across projects to identify potential organizational, social, or tool-based contradictions affecting their work. Given these challenges, an opportunity exists for technical communicators to leverage skills in communication analysis and modeling to aid project professionals with reflective exercises. Method: We propose an Activity Theory framework to analyze and model email communications generated during a project lifecycle to help technical communicators identify emerging contradictions and provide reflective feedback loops for project workers. Using the Enron corpus, we offer a case study detailing the construction of a reflective activity-centric model for project workers. Results: Our case study provides empirical evidence that activity-centric models can be constructed using email and attachments when organized by the five process groups outlined in the Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK). Sample modeling and questions derived from the work offers examples for reflective engagement with project professionals. Conclusion: Activity-centric models derived from email records offer technical communicators an approach to identifying contradictions within and across projects. Resulting models and reflective exercises can support project professionals with feedback loops aimed at improving how they understand their work and the collective culture in which it is produced. © 2018, Society for Technical Communication.

Method: The study design employed convergent parallel mixed methods to identify common themes. Qualitative data were collected through open-form survey questions, diary/activity logs with follow-up semi-structured interviews, and contextual inquiry methods. Quantitative data were collected through surveys with Likert-rating scales and choice questions. Data were collected using three sources (novice engineer, engineering manager, researcher) to triangulate methods and consisted of a macro-study, with 12 participant engineer/manager pairings, and a micro-study, with 4 pairings. Results: During data analysis, a major theme that emerged was project management communication activities, such as planning project activities, providing or soliciting updates on project activities, coordinating or facilitating a meeting or training session, and documenting and disseminating meeting discussions. Managers provide constructive criticism to novice engineers regarding their communication abilities. Specific themes were needing to (1) provide ‘big picture’ context prior to technical details; (2) develop clear, appropriate written and visual content; (3) provide confident, timely content to the audience; and (4) increase interactions with technicians and operators. Conclusions: Novice engineers fit into a technical and social context and communicate as project managers. These communications and activities are not reserved only for more experienced engineers. Additional research with novice engineers and project management communication activities would be helpful, including an analysis of the training and support needed to be effective communicators as project managers. © 2018, Society for Technical Communication.

Method: The meetings from three sprints were audio-recorded and all spoken exchanges were transcribed. A codebook was developed to assess for meeting function PM language. A correspondence analysis assessed the association of Scrum meeting type and PM language. Results: The results of this exploratory study suggest that the Scrum team members use PM language in somewhat ritualized ways, particularly when some of the PM language is deployed. The correspondence analysis also suggests five associations between certain meeting types and certain PM language. Conclusion: This exploratory study provides a baseline of in situ Scrum-based project management upon which other studies may build, which may become useful as future studies may expand to include Kanban and Scrumban. It also suggests that while this Scrum-based group uses some PM language in expected ways (i.e., team maintenance is associated with kickoff meetings), other uses are unexpected (i.e., planning language is not associated with planning meetings). These differentiations from the ideal Scrum PM process suggest that future research is warranted. © 2018, Society for Technical Communication.

Members work with association writers to actively influence the content and products, resulting in a unique rhetorical situation that drives iterative and flexible project management processes. Method: This case study draws from semi-structured retrospective interviews conducted as part of a larger ethnographic study of trade organization communicators, their educational products, and their interaction with association members. Results: The organizational structure of a trade organization results in a rhetorical situation in which technical communicators interact constantly with association members in both informal and formal settings, which leads to invention for informational products. The association restructured their communications team twice during this study in efforts to get more workers in contact with members and to create better content packages where editors, designers, and other specialists have input at multiple stages. Restructuring and the participation of members meant project management strategies must be flexible and arise from the rhetorical situation. Conclusion: Though not drawing on specific project management strategies like Six Sigma or Agile, this organization creates and adapts flexible processes so that technical communicators can best serve their organizational mission. In addition, processes respond to the rhetorical situation created between members and writers, as well as between managers and technical communicators. Managers work to empower these TCs who are taking on more project management roles. © 2018, Society for Technical Communication.

This has led to a number of social media foibles that can create a public relations nightmare for the affected companies. This article will explore the emerging phenomenon of the corporate Twitter apology and the rhetorical constructs that are required for an effective apology. Method: Using the strategies of Ruth Page and John Kador, I have analyzed successful and unsuccessful Twitter apologies. The success of these apologies is determined by the public response from the tertiary audiences comprised of Twitter followers. Results: This study determined that successful Twitter apologies use a combination of Kador’s strategies (Recognition, Responsibility, Remorse, Restitution, and Repetition), originally implemented for analog apologies, adapted for electronic communications to make a successful social media apology. Conclusion: Surviving any serious social media foible depends upon issuing a successful apology and doing so on the social media platform where the original offense took place. Social media mistakes, though unique in their scope and potential to reach an ever-expanding tertiary audience, can be managed using the same strategies that apply to analog apologies. © 2018, Society for Technical Communication.

The goal of the article is to demonstrate how project management has been discussed and studied by the field. By analyzing the field’s approach to project management, the article sets groundwork for research, pedagogies, and best practices that prepare technical and professional communicators to shape effective project management practices. Method: To achieve this goal, we assembled a sample of 326 sources across academic and practitioner publishing venues from the years 2005–2016. To comprise the sample, we used targeted keyword searches to identify published work that addressed project management in technical and professional communication. Results: Project management in technical and professional communication is often presented as an adjacent practice to other concepts or practices, such as leadership or documentation management. Additionally, project management is described or discussed primarily in terms of skills and relationships established through concepts such as teaming, collaboration, professional communication, communication theory, and education. Conclusion: The limited characterization of project management in the existing research creates the opportunity for technical and professional communicators (TPCs) to explicitly acknowledge the complexity of project management from a rhetorical perspective. The outcome of this rhetorical approach would position TPCs to develop and shape ethical and audience-focused PM practices through their communication expertise. © 2018, Society for Technical Communication.

Scholars find a cross-disciplinary disparity on what interactivity embodies and accomplishes. This article traces the definitions of interactivity in existing research, devises seven dimensions of interactivity for wearables and IoT products, and identifies key roles for technical communicators in immersive media design. Method: A research review of key literature on interactivity in general and technical communication and mobile technologies in particular. Results: Current literature shows that concepts of interactivity in communication design and technology are multifaceted. Seven dimensions of interactivity can be derived for immersive media design: 1) reciprocity/ease of response, 2) synchronicity/context awareness, 3) connectedness/ubiquity/pervasiveness, 4) navigability/accessibility, 5) user control/personalization, 6) entertainment/sensibility, and 7) sensory stimulation/ multimodality. These dimensions can be mapped onto the interactive design of wearables and IoT products. They also inform the roles of technical communicators in producing immersive technical communication. Conclusion: Further investigation of the constructs in interactivity can help uncover a more accurate relationship between interactivity and its dependent variables. The new dimensions of interactivity in immersive media environments suggest that technical communicators and designers must pay attention to 1) the seamless connection between the user and the systems, data, and actions; 2) user control and customization; 3) proactive contextual assistance from smart technologies; and 4) device sensibility and sensory stimulations. © 2018, Society for Technical Communication.

To illustrate, I report a subset of findings regarding occasions when ambiguous documents had a significant impact on a democratically managed organization. Methods: I conducted a three-phase study of a democratic cooperative. Using a mixed-methods approach, I sought to uncover the ways technical and professional communication (TPC) concerns like ambiguity and clarity function in a democratic business. In my analysis, I looked for patterns and dissonance between/among artifacts and participants, paying special attention to areas of ambiguity. Interviews and transcripts were analyzed alongside various genres using rhetorical analysis. Results: Looking at two significant documents—job descriptions and bylaws—I found that ambiguity was rarely benign at Owen’s House. In the job descriptions, ambiguity rendered key positions dysfunctional and undermined the collective, resulting in a crisis. However, ambiguity in the bylaws allowed the collective to reinterpret organizational goals in support of necessary changes critical to achieving solvency. Conclusion: When building unified diversity, democratic organizations must consider the positive and negative consequences of textual ambiguity. This consideration should extend to regulatory documents where clarity is often an assumed objective. Documents need to be flexible enough to adapt to changes and defined enough to avoid sliding into dysfunction. © 2018, Society for Technical Communication.

Method: We analyzed 474 job postings in India and the United Kingdom/Ireland. We conducted a content analysis of the postings, coding for information products, technologies, professional competencies, and personal characteristics. We compared postings to postings for the US, utilizing ANOVA and CHI square measures to evaluate whether differences in the data were meaningful. Results: The study reveals substantial variation regarding employer expectations. US postings are characterized by higher experience levels and more qualifications than postings for the international markets, with greater focus on user documentation and reports, working with SMEs, usability/testing, technology, and personal characteristics. The Indian postings are the most distinct from the US positions, with differing experience levels and emphasis on what qualifications are important. Conclusion: The study emphasizes a need for greater understanding of international technical communication and the ways outsourcing may impact career choices. The variation across markets suggests that we cannot assume standard practices in the US transcend linguistic, geographical, and cultural boundaries. This is important both for meeting the challenges of outsourcing and for international collaborations more broadly. The study also highlights the need for curricula to address the complexities of a global workplace by providing students with both technical communication and intercultural competencies. © 2017, Society for Technical Communication.

This manuscript provides readers with a survey of recent editing-related job requirements, gives a brief assessment of popular technical editing textbooks, and describes two iterations of an editing course redesign in which the authors gave students a broader exposure to editing than text and markup. Method: The authors examined the job postings in conjunction with course descriptions, popular technical editing textbooks, and other media to gauge how well undergraduate classes were helping students gain necessary competencies for entering the workforce. Following, the authors redeveloped the curriculum for a 4000-level technical editing class. The curriculum reduced the focus on text editing and markup; instead, it framed the diversity of the profession to students through working with editing manuals/standards, MS Word and Adobe Acrobat, and audio, video, and websites. At semester’s end, students were asked to provide feedback on course and content. Results: The revisions to the course disrupted student notions of pencils, paper, and grammar as the backbone of editing. Students were surprised by the new media focus but found it to be very useful. Most had little idea about the breadth of technical editing and enjoyed the exposure to multimodal editing. Most students, however, wanted more work with language basics. Conclusion: Editing jobs are morphing and students need practice in new media environments. Students are able to consider editing competencies as extending beyond text and traditional markup. Yet, most still feel uncomfortable with their own expertise in those areas. Programs should develop more than one editing class: a basic class for language, tools, and technologies, and an advanced class focusing on specific editing topics, such as video, audio, images, and Web. © 2017, Society for Technical Communication.

It suggests that when TCs explicitly promote user advocacy to explain their work practices, it more positively represents the work that TCs do to other stakeholders. Method: Using an ethnographic perspective, we reflect on how grounding our thinking, decisions, and actions in user advocacy during interactions with non-TCs resulted in successful outcomes. Results: Promoting user advocacy while conducting user-centered design and user experience (UCD/UX) activities resulted in positive perceptions about our technical communication work; it broadened how non-TCs viewed our work beyond predetermined technical communication contexts. Conclusion: Promoting user advocacy in tandem with UCD/UX methods may provide a productive avenue for TCs to connect their value to broader organizational goals and promote and preserve positive workplace identities. © 2017, Society for Technical Communication.

The annual report is a formal document that fulfills the mandatory disclosure requirements and serves as an organization’s mass communication medium to inform shareholders, investors, employees, customers, suppliers, and the press, as well as the general public. In particular, large enterprises provide an additional online version of their report. We investigated user engagement at first contact with such Web-based annual reports and the influence of main report characteristics— content, usability, and aesthetics—on corporate image and overall impressions. Method: In a Web-based study, 155 participants read one of eight online corporate annual reports from German companies. Corporate image was assessed before and after browsing the report, overall impression afterwards. The report characteristics content, usability, and aesthetics were measured with established and validated questionnaires. Results: Findings were in line with our hypotheses: Corporate image significantly improved from before to after reading a Web-based annual report, even as reading time was short, demonstrating a mere exposure effect. The report characteristics content, usability, and aesthetics explained 20.5% of the variation in this increase and 66.0% of the overall impression of the reports; the best predictor was visual aesthetics. Conclusion: Content features of corporate reports are often limited by legal requirements, and usability of online reports is mainly driven by users’ demands. However, organizations can positively influence their public perception by improving the visual design of their annual reports online. © 2017, Society for Technical Communication.

The purpose is to learn whether academic programs offer the course work and opportunities students need. Additionally, I discuss job-ad requirements for entry-level technical writers in the workplace and compare technical/professional academic program offerings with those job-ad requirements. Method: Recruiters and hiring managers were surveyed to learn their top priorities for skills and experiences. Data from job ads of three job boards was gathered and analyzed, and this data was compared to academic program requirements across the United States. Results: While technical and professional writing programs are ever-changing and substantially different, there are similarities, and the programs seem to be preparing students well for the workplace. Conclusion: Most programs require core courses that are similar in name and description and require additional study in an area of expertise or a minor. These core curricula align well to the requirements in entry-level job ads in the industry. More research is needed to learn the best ways students learn in university courses. Additionally, we need to investigate the consistency of internship requirements among programs and encourage industries to consider internship experience as legitimate industry experience. © 2017, Society for Technical Communication.

Methods: This qualitative study was conducted over two years and included formal and informal interviews, observations of workplace and public projects, and the collection of project documents. Results: My findings suggest that technical communicators who hope to implement public engagement function across three different roles within the dialogic public engagement process: participant, facilitator, and designer.

This article suggests that articulating the value of TPC is an ongoing process, particularly for practitioners, who have found ways to combat stereotypes. Method: Findings are based on 39 qualitative, semistructured interviews with female practitioners of TPC. Participants were solicited across the United States and varied in age, class, industry, organization, ethnicity, socioeconomic background, sexual orientation, and marital/family status. This article uses feminist research methodologies, with data from semistructured interviews analyzed through feminist content analysis. Results: The data suggests that TPC is still considered to be expendable in workplaces. Participants highlighted the misconceptions and mischaracterizations of their work, including the myths that TPC work is cosmetic, secretarial, unarticulated, unnecessary, invisible, and unquantifiable. However, practitioners are moving forward despite these misconceptions. They face a host of pressures, but these conflicts are opportunities to prove value and change misconceptions. Conclusion: Devaluation continues to permeate the profession, but practitioners have become skilled at combatting it. They know that educating others on the value of TPC is an ongoing project, highlighting the ability of practitioners to be an integral part of an expanding knowledge economy, all-edge adhocracies, and unique and networked organizations. Practitioners and scholars must continue to challenge and change stereotypes about TPC. © 2017, Society for Technical Communication.

Method: A rhetorical analysis was conducted of email messages written during the three crisis situations. The analysis was based on previous studies which indicate that writers of electronic messages provide insufficient information, compose writer-rather than reader-based texts, and use inappropriate formats for communicating complex or controversial issues. Results: A failure to include sufficient information characterized a number of the email messages sent prior to the BP/Horizon explosion. Writer-rather than reader-based messages were written prior to the BP/Horizon explosion as well as during the Columbia breakup. Some of these messages included personal and irrelevant information as well as social media conventions conflated with business formats. Various BP/Horizon oil rig messages were also often communicated in an inappropriate format for discussing complex and controversial information. On the other hand, email messages sent following the Skokie landslide appear to be reader-based, contain no personal or irrelevant information, are free of social media conventions, and provide responses in a timely manner. Conclusion: Had writers in the BP explosion and the Columbia breakup written reader-based texts as well as recognized the asynchronous nature of electronic communication, their messages may have been more effective. © 2017, Society for Technical Communication.

Method: This article analyzes storytelling by means of a case study in the art of narrative as used in support of an organization, community, and industry. The organization is Y-12 National Security Complex, which makes parts for America’s nuclear arsenal and does research and production in nuclear materials for medicine, biology, industry, and nuclear energy and propulsion. The community is Oak Ridge, Tennessee and environs. “Industry” references the nuclear industry in Oak Ridge and beyond, including its partnership with the U.S. military. The subject of the case study—the person whose narrative art is here analyzed—is Ray Smith, official historian of Y-12. The material analyzed comes from publications by Smith, notes from interviews with him on multiple occasions, and many sessions of listening to his stories both in person and via recordings (documentaries, presentations available on web sites, etc.). Results: This study finds that Smith’s stories connected with the Manhattan Project, and the years preceding and succeeding it, constitute a model set of narratives displaying the rhetorical power of storytelling in an organizational setting. Conclusion: By studying the ways narrative is successfully used in professional settings, we deepen our understanding of rhetorical storytelling as well as our ability to use it. This skill has wide application to contexts of technical and professional communication. It can be used to elevate public opinion about a corporation, community, or industry; to breed confidence among consumers and investors; to construct leadership models for managers; to inspire and motivate employees—and in virtually any other sort of rhetorical enterprise. © 2017, Society for Technical Communication.

However, a recent critique of personas questioned their usefulness as a tool for audience analysis. This article takes that question as the starting point to offer a re-conceptualization of persona creation. Method: A comprehensive review of the literature with a case study as an extended example provides insights into the necessity of updating update how technical communicators create personas. Results: The literature review exposes major gaps in the research about persona development that, when compared to the case study, shows the need for technical communicators to update the dimensions of how personas are created and to reclaim the emphasis on goals and purposes of the user’s practice. Conclusion: Technical communicators need to re-conceptualize the creation of personas by incorporating additional dimensions that create embodied personas for a mobile world and that reclaim and refocus the persona’s emphasis on goals and purposes rather than simply a focus on audience. These changes allow technical communicators to meet the needs of users of complex information systems and, thereby, to contribute more meaningfully to user experience projects. © 2017, Society for Technical Communication.

To investigate differences in user perceptions of commercial and official manuals, we conducted two studies: one focusing on user expectations and one on user experiences. Method: The first study was an online experiment, in which two groups of participants answered questions about their expectations of a (commercial or official) manual. The second study was a 2×2 experiment, with perceived source (commercial or official) and the actual content of the instructions (commercial or official) as independent variables, and task performance and users’ judgments as dependent variables. Results: The first study showed that users have different expectations of commercial and official manuals, and overall think more positively about a commercial manual. The second study showed that perceived source had a significant effect on task performance: Participants worked better when they thought they used a commercial manual. No differences were found regarding participants’ judgments of the manual. Conclusion: Our research indicates a potential image problem of official user manuals. Even though we found no evidence for a lower quality of the official manual’s content, users’ relatively negative expectations of an official manual may discourage them from using the official user instructions. The second study showed that the perceived source (commercial/official) may even affect the actual task performance of users. © 2017, Society for Technical Communication.

Studies advocate for more effective communication with management, but scholarship has yet to adequately address the relationship between establishing and explaining value and management philosophy. This article takes up the two issues of workplace value and “speaking the language of business” as they relate to management efficiency philosophy, specifically Lean and Six Sigma. I argue that management philosophy, particularly efficiency philosophies, is an integral, yet often overlooked, aspect of organizational context that affects both organizational structures and cultures. Method: I share the results of an ethnographic study of a series of trainings that were part of a Lean initiative. I buttress these observations with two documents, one internal and one customer-facing, from Lean Six Sigma initiatives. Results: The trainings illustrate the work of creating an organizational culture and the importance of communication in developing a sustainable Lean culture. The two documents are examples of how processes and workflow (e.g., organizational structures) are written in efficiency environments. Conclusion: Practitioners and researchers should see efficiency management philosophies as important components of organizational contexts not to be glossed over. Communication is acknowledged as important to maintaining culture, but TPC knowledge and expertise are not necessarily recognized. The two documents show opportunities in these kinds of cultures to make work visible and establish value. © 2017, Society for Technical Communication.

Method: Using leading design principles, I created postcards for the Office of the Washington Secretary of State that were mailed to unregistered residents. In addition to measuring the overall effectiveness of the postcards, the study evaluated the differences between two rhetorical messages. Bothpostcards described the same registration process, but one focused on the user-friendly aspects of the online application while the other emphasized that registering to vote is a social norm. Results: Residents in three counties withlarge Latino populations were mailed bilingual English-Spanishpostcards. The total treatment effect was significantly higher among recipients in these counties than the rest of the state but withno noticeable difference between two rhetorical messages. Statewide, the overall results show that the postcard describing the voter registration experience as “fast and easy” was significantly more effective than persuading recipients to register using social pressure. Emphasizing convenience was especially effective among 18-year-olds. Conclusion: The study suggests that election administrators can create a more culturally inclusive voter registration process by designing bilingual outreachmaterials. This article offers several lessons learned for voter outreachdesign and discusses potential avenues for the continued study of culturally inclusive UX practices as applied to voter registration outreach. © 2017.

Method: As part of a larger project, the researchers observed and recorded (throughvideo footage and field notes) translation activities taking place in a Language Services office during the course of two years. To visualize translation activities, the researchers used screencast recordings that captured how translators coordinated digital resources (e.g., digital translation tools, online dictionaries) to successfully translate information. Finally, the researchers conducted 12 artifact-based interviews withtranslators at the researchsite. Results: Results show that translation, technical communication, and design activities are enacted iteratively and recursively by participants at this researchsite. Translators at this site must work across diverse design processes (UX design, information design, visual and document design) that often get subsumed into the translation process. Althoughemployees within this organization do not consider themselves designers or technical communicators, the work that takes place within this office requires expertise across these areas of study and practice. Conclusion: Designing and creating multilingual content often requires the intellectual contributions of individuals who can move across translation, technical communication, and design activities simultaneously. As the field of technical communication (particularly in the US) continues to acknowledge the value of global, multilingual content, it’s important that we highlight the expertise and added value of the multilingual communicators who make this work possible and accessible to users across cultures and languages. ©2017.

This article presents a researchapproachtechnical communicators can use to better understand and design materials for the different contexts in whichindividual in other nations use a given technology or communication product. Method: I review how an understanding of the context in whichindividuals use an iteM(i.e., context of use) affects what constitutes usability in a setting. I then review how script theory (froMcognitive psychology) and prototype theory (froMlinguistics) can be combined to create an effective method for identifying the variables affecting use in different cultural contexts. Results: A focused application of script theory can provide technical communicators witha framework for identifying the variables affecting usability in different cultural contexts. Suchidentification can be enhanced by a targeted application of prototype theory, and technical communicators can use a combination of script theory and prototype theory to develop communication products more attuned to different cultural contexts of use. Conclusion: When combined in a focused way, a script-prototype theory approachto researching the context of use in other cultures can help technical communicators better understand suchcontexts and design materials that better meet the expectations of users in other cultures. © 2017.

In this spirit, I examined the local ways in whichcommunity technology center (CTC) tutors helped teachinexperienced users how to use information and communication technologies (ICTs) during basiCcomputer courses. Method: I collected data throughethnographiCmethods including participantobservation, qualitative interviews, and extant documents. Using grounded theory (Charmaz, 2006; Glaser & Strauss, 1967; Strauss & Corbin, 1990), I developed open codes and constantly compared codes to develop categories and properties. Results: Inexperienced ICT users are unable to utilize online and other resources because they often lack the necessary physical experience working withICTs and the cultural knowledge to operate them. CTCtutors serve as local technical communication experts who construct effective methods for helping learners by: 1) utilizing visual representations, 2) utilizing audible representations, and 3) heightening learner awareness for visual cues. Conclusion: Inexperienced users struggle withusing ICT hardware and software. An on-the-ground approachto studying usability in the field makes user experience researchbothmore inclusive and comprehensive. Suchinsight froMinexperienced users sheds light on how digital inequalities persist and how practitioners and scholars can work to ensure inexperienced users are not forgotten in UX research. © 2017.

We argue that localized community strategy is crucial not only to practice that aims for inclusivity and social justice but also to researchand theory building that aims for inclusivity and social justice. Method: We model a dialogic, localized knowledge-making process that operates at the level of collaborative researchbetween a theorist and a practitioner and at the level of international practice. The authors collaboratively analyzed the experiences of the practitioner, as well as our own collaboration process, and coded theMfor key dimensions, whichcan guide and be further developed bothin practice and in research. Results: The authors identify and discuss four key dimensions of a community strategist’s localization practices—localizing communities, localizing goals, localizing communication, and localizing inclusion—and illustrate theMbothin our own collaborative practice of analysis and in the practice of international community strategy. Conclusion: The definitions of user, community, and diversity themselves must be continually localized in our work to engage across cultures and across theory and practice. We call for further collaboration and researchat the intersections of international community strategy work withtechnical communication and global user experience, particularly the role of localizing diversity and inclusion. © 2017.

Method: We conducted an empirical analysis of 235 blog posts from June 2014 to March 2016. We analyzed and coded each post for 14 unique variables including article type, topic, and citation style. We then analyzed the data using both descriptive and inferential statistics in order to reveal patterns in the data. Results: An overwhelming majority of the blog posts were written by practitioners for practitioners. Of the 235 blog posts, the most common topics were technology, professionalization, and communication strategies. Of the technology posts written, DITA was by far the most common technology topic. The most common article types were argumentative, process, and how-to articles. While practitioners rarely blog about research, when they do, they spend most of their time writing about results and discussion as opposed to introductions or methodology. Finally, our analysis revealed that bloggers made intentional visual design choices when sharing knowledge via blogs. Conclusion: Practitioners use distinct knowledge dissemination patterns in blog conversations that shape how research is presented to the technical communication community. Understanding these patterns is an important first step toward developing a shared language that will help bridge the gap in understanding between the academic and practitioner communities. Ultimately, blogs are a useful forum for studying practitioner conversations and developing broader understanding about what they value in their work and research. © 2016, Society for Technical Communication.

We wanted to give practitioners a forum to provide their perspectives on what research is and what questions the field should be researching. Method: We conducted 30 asynchronous interviews with practitioners, and then analyzed the interviews for common themes and topics. Results: Interviewees (practitioners) noted an interest in research that examined how individuals (particularly specific audiences) use different technologies as well as an interest in collaborating with academics to explore research on different topics and from different perspectives. Conclusion: The information reported here and the related questions it raises can enhance understanding of and facilitate collaboration across the field. This study helps industry practitioners of technical communication to better understand how other industry practitioners in the field view and think of research; it also helps academic researchers in technical communication to better understand perspectives, assumptions, and expectations industry practitioners have about research. © 2016, Society for Technical Communication.

Method: The article uses qualitative methods informed by theories of social network analysis to examine interview data collected from eight successful technical communication entrepreneurs. Results: Technical communication entrepreneurs actively publish and read publications to learn relevant information about the field, influence practice, and build professional conversations. Academic publications are often outside these entrepreneurs’ scope of interest because of differing timescales, venues, and key terms; however, they often read publications of and publish toward the professional networks generated as they connect with others for business interests. Conclusion: The field must continue to find ways to bridge academic and practitioner divides by seeking common venues, shared timelines, and collaborating on emerging topics of interest. However, these divides are more complex than simply among academics and practitioners, as knowledge flows in the field have become multidirectional rather than two-sided. © 2016, Society for Technical Communication.

However, the publication needs and motivations of academics and practitioners have resulted in content alignment issues so divergent that it oftentimes appears that both parties are from different planets. Method: We empirically analyzed the content within 1,048 published articles over a 20-year period within core professional and academic forums. We coded the articles for variables related to topic and audience. Data were analyzed through descriptive statistics and correspondence analysis. Results: Our field’s core content forums have evolved little over the last 27 years. Results also indicated distinct differences in article topics and audience that reflect the varying interests of academics and practitioners. Intercom and Technical Communication Quarterly emerged as the most defined forums. Conclusion: The incongruity within professional and academic articles further suggests that we are a fragmented discipline. We recommend that our current content forums adopt structured abstracts and implications statements to unify our research and that researchers seek alternative audiences for their scholarship. We also call on practitioners to strengthen their involvement in research, either by contributing to scholarship or by volunteering their organizations as research sites. © 2016, Society for Technical Communication.

Method: A patient education software application was developed with an interdisciplinary collaboration between a medical animation company, a surgery clinic, and an academic researcher who is also a technical communication practitioner. User-centered design principles were employed in the development of the application. Interviews were conducted to reveal insights about the application’s influence on the language participants used to discuss the procedure. Results: Participants who used the software application to learn about the procedure were able to consistently recognize and recall more informational and procedural knowledge than participants who did not use the application. Conclusion: Collaborations similar to this can enhance the design, creation, development, and assessment of technical communication materials in patient education settings to help improve the odds that patients will understand more about their health and be able to make better decisions and can contribute valuable information to the technical communication curriculum. Best practices in technical communication can inform user-centered design, development, and assessment of educational materials in a variety of settings. © 2016, Society for Technical Communication.

To argue that a standardized process modeling notation can assist with bridging cultural communication gaps brought on by globalized workplaces. Method: A rhetorical analysis emphasizing how effectively technical communication visualizations address audience, purpose, and documentation conventions. Communication visualizations were modeled first using nonstandard and then standardized modeling techniques. The visualizations were generated as part of a qualitative study to represent the business and communication processes of a senior level employee from a software firm. Results: Nonstandard or proprietary data models and visualizations are not readily useful to diverse audiences, especially global audiences. Models should be developed with notation software that supports open standards. Conclusion: Technical communicators should become proficient with process modeling notation and understand the fundamentals of standardized notations such as Uniform Modeling Language (UML) and Business Process Modeling Notation (BPMN). Academics teaching and researching technical communication should be wary of creating a divide between industry and the academy by perpetuating the use of non-standard models. © 2016, Society for Technical Communication.

Questions explored include, What underlines this new design trend in American vs. Chinese cultures? How has this new design emerged? How will it evolve in the future? What culturally, underwritten aesthetic and rhetorical principles are at play? Method: Samples of user interface (UI) design are collected from both cultures and examined to compare similarities and differences wherever possible. In-depth textual analysis is used to deconstruct particular design cases. Results: Our analysis indicates that while flat design is the new trend, skeuomorphism has its place in UI design; each design has its advantages and shortcomings; and effective design may require the integration of both approaches. Our study also reveals that designs are culturally sensitive and that each particular design is contextualized and rhetorical. Flat design’s popularity in the Chinese context has its unique rationale due to social, ideological, cultural, and linguistic reasons. Conclusion: Savvy designers combine professional taste and culturally sensitive perspectives to produce effective designs that work for their particular contexts. © 2016, Society for Technical Communication.

Method: We analyzed 502 user experience job postings from Monster.com. After mining the postings for position title, job type, education level, experience level, location, salary, and industry sector, we conducted a content analysis of the job descriptions, using open coding to identify professional competencies and personal characteristics that employers are seeking in applicants, as well as key technologies and information products. Results: The user experience job postings could be grouped into five categories— Designer, Developer, Architect, Manager, Researcher—each with a distinct profile in terms of information products, technology skills, and professional competencies. However, the job postings also reflected skills, competencies, and characteristics that were common across job categories, and several of these are areas that overlap with more traditional technical communication positions. Conclusion: We articulate the advantages and challenges of transitioning into UX and make recommendations to help technical communication practitioners and programs capitalize on the advantages and address the challenges. © 2016, Society for Technical Communication.

Specifically, the model is designed to facilitate rapid and incremental delivery and increased quality and efficiency. Method: The refined iterative development model is based on an analysis of models from across a range of industries. The analysis was designed to clearly define what a development model is, the basic phases it contains, and various common uses. The approach to this project was from the perspective of a practicing technical communication professional and project manager. Results: The analysis revealed that development models are visual, conceptual, representational, process-oriented, inventive, and both sequential and iterative. The basic phases common to development models are, generally speaking, Discovery, Planning, Implementation, Review, Refinement, and Release (or Deployment). Common uses include sharing knowledge, facilitating success, enhancing credibility, and demonstrating progress. Conclusion: The analysis and comparison allows for a deeper understanding of what a development model is and how a refined iterative development model can be used to improve processes related to information development. © 2016, Society for Technical Communication.

Changing the relationship between designer and user, this new form of data design has intensified the affective impact of data displays by eliciting emotions ranging from excitement and empathy to anxiety and fear. Methods: This article draws on historical and contemporary sources to build its case. It gives an overview of emotional appeals in the rhetorical tradition, from Aristotle to modern theorists like George Campbell, who emphasized sensory responses through personalization and proximity. The article provides an historical overview of pathos appeals in data design during the later nineteenth century and the shift to modernist minimalism in the twentieth century. Contemporary examples from companies, nonprofits, government agencies, and individual designers illustrate how data visualization arouses emotion. Results: Emotional appeals during the nineteenth century focused primarily on color and design novelty, which, by appealing largely to the senses, fostered emotional responses such as excitement and curiosity. Contemporary data visualization makes similar emotional appeals through the use of color, novelty, and multimodal features; however, digital technology also allows designers to appeal to the emotions by personalizing displays through interactivity, spatial and temporal proximity, and aesthetic and expressive elements. Conclusion: Pathos (emotional) appeals have become an integral part of contemporary data visualization, largely because of the multimodal and interactive affordances of digital technology. Designers who understand this dimension of data design can deploy technology to make their displays more engaging, humane, and usable. © 2016, Society for Technical Communication.

Method: I asked twenty subjects to walk down a high school hallway decorated with flyers and posters. I interviewed them immediately afterward and one week later to determine which information “stuck” over time as well as the subjects’ self-reported reasons for recalling information. I then analyzed the most-often remembered documents to correlate the subjects’ responses to the documents’ content, design, style, etc. Results: Contrast, color, and imagery are inherently attention-catching and memorable. However, engaging the audience’s collective self-schema, or identity, impacts memory even more powerfully by prompting readers to ascribe relevance to information and thus strive to remember it. Accordingly, I propose the following heuristic for creating more effective, mnemonic documents: (a) convey practical value; (b) use contrast, color, and imagery; (c) tap the familiar; (d) introduce unexpected elements; (e) build social currency; and (f) arouse emotion. Conclusion: Technical communicators can enhance their documents’ effectiveness by using the proposed heuristic to make information more memorable for their readers. © 2016, Society for Technical Communication.

To illustrate, we report a subset of findings regarding how technical and professional communication supports successful humanitarian work. Method: We conducted a three-phase longitudinal study of an international humanitarian organization. In Phases 1 and 2, we conducted phone/Skype interviews with 25 practitioners, a group including international, regional, national, and local levels of the organization. In Phase 3, we engaged in ethnographic observation of work practices in six countries and conducted a total of 95 additional interviews (in person) with humanitarian practitioners. Results: Communication plays an important role in the success of practitioners’ day-to-day work when that communication pursues goals relevant to humanitarian culture, such as showing respect for local ways of operating. Specifically, our findings show that enacting humanitarian culture led practitioners to (a) localize how they speak, (b) collaboratively produce written documents, and (c) encourage bottom-up organizational communication. Conclusion: We found that while many of our field’s skills and areas of expertise carried over to humanitarian environments, the values and motivations associated with humanitarian culture are what influenced the effective application of these skills and are, therefore, key to the effectiveness of communication. In particular, finegrained localization and empowerment at the lowest level are central to professional communication that supports successful humanitarian work. © 2016, Society for Technical Communication.

The aim of the study is to provide a better understanding of instructional video patterns and typologies and to find associations between video style usage and course attributes such as the MOOC platform and course subjects. Method: Five global, generalist MOOC platforms were selected for this study, which was conducted in two phases: First, a qualitative survey was made to identify frequently used video styles and build a classification scheme. Second, a sample of 115 courses in the selected MOOC platforms was used to account for video features and style frequencies. Various statistical tests were performed to discover associations between course characteristics and video style usage. Results: Seven video styles were identified as the most frequent in MOOC courses. They fully describe the video stock of 85% of the sampled courses. A typical course uses two different styles. The study reveals two broad competing approaches to display instructional contents in MOOC videos: speaker-centric (a visible person speaks the contents) and board-centric (a large rectangular surface displays the contents). The actual usage of each approach is significantly related to the course subject area: Arts and humanities courses exhibit a preference for speaker-centric styles, while engineering and hard science courses favor board-centric videos. Social sciences and health courses are more neutral. Conclusion: Current MOOCs are focused on few representational styles, with speakers and boards as the two main models.

In this study, I wanted to know if the designers of Souq.com relied solely on the universal principles of ICD to build a uniquely Arabized and successful site. Equally, I wanted to discover what other dimensions are in play when it comes to designing content for target users. Method: I reviewed the literature and developed a framework based on key indicators of ICD. I then analyzed the layout and Web content of Souq.com by examining interface and content, focusing on the homepage. Results: The principles of ICD, while foundational, require additional knowledge in order to meet the needs of local users and to build a sense of ownership of those principles. The process of designing for local users can benefit from insider knowledge and singular interpretation of a people’s culture, language, and traditions. Conclusion: ICD is invaluable for the basic framework it offers. However, its principles are in themselves insufficient when it comes to designing not globally but locally. © 2016.

We report on an exploratory study about the feasibility of using HDITA as an authoring platform for technical content. We asked how novice technical writers describe and evaluate the complexity and difficulty of the different stages of the HDITA authoring process and if novice technical writers can author effective topic-based technical content in HTML5 (HDITA) without full knowledge of XML (DITA). Method: To evaluate the feasibility of authoring and publishing with HDITA, we modified the Instructions assignment of an introductory college course called Technical Writing. Students wrote blog posts during the authoring process and completed a survey on the perceived difficulty of HDITA. We evaluated the quality of HDITA Web deliverables with college students from diverse technical and academic backgrounds. Results: Most author students were somewhat confident authoring technical content with HDITA, and most said they were very likely to somewhat likely to use HDITA in the future for technical writing projects. Students reported that the most difficult part of using HDITA involved Web templates and not HDITA itself. Twenty-seven students evaluated HDITA deliverables and gave them positive scores using a rubric for assessing quality technical information. Conclusion: Acknowledging the small number of student authors involved in this feasibility study, we can still conclude that novice technical writers did not perceive creating technical documentation with HDITA as difficult or highly complex. Most student evaluators were able to complete the assigned tasks following the instructions created in HDITA. © 2016. Society for Technical Communication.

Our project updates these previous perspectives by analyzing the broad range of information products, technologies, professional competencies, and personal traits requested by industry job advertisements. The analysis seeks to answer three main questions: • What genre/information product knowledge is important for success in the technical communication job market? • What technology skills are essential for success in the technical communication job market? • What professional competencies and personal characteristics are essential for success in the technical communication job market? Method: We analyzed almost 1,000 U.S. technical communication job postings from Monster.com. We mined the postings for position title, job type, education level, experience level, location, salary, and industry sector. We subsequently conducted a content analysis of the job descriptions, using open coding to identify information products, technologies, professional competencies, and personal characteristics. Results: The job postings exhibited enormous variety in position titles but fell into five main categories: Content Developer/Manager, Grant/Proposal Writer, Medical Writer, Social Media Writer, and Technical Writer/Editor. Information products and technology skills varied substantially with job type. The job postings showed some differentiation in professional competencies across job categories, but they also revealed competencies that were common to all categories. Conclusion: Technical communication positions now encompass a wide range of audiences, content, contexts, and media. The jobs data illustrate the breadth of products and competencies that drive the field. © 2015, Society for Technical Communication.

Methods: The article draws from technical communication theory and practice to explain a bottom-up method of designing effective materials for international audiences. Results: By creating opportunities to document cultural encounters through media that can convey the complexity of face-to-face communication, readers learn to seek a more bottom-up approach to understanding culture. Conclusion: Because culture is not static but constantly transforming, technical communicators must challenge traditional models that seek to address culture from the perspective of a single, national cultural identity. Rather, a more “bottom-up” (that is, not predetermined) understanding of cultural communication practices is needed to help technical communicators create more effective materials for international users. A bottom-up understanding of culture can support improved intercultural technical communication outcomes. © 2015, Society for Technical Communication.

Method: Rhetorical analysis of four select infographics created by the New York Times to communicate Ebola risk during the outbreak that began in West Africa in 2014 using the following facets associated with design in global contexts: use of warm and cool colors, high versus low-context, and collectivism versus individualism. Results: Data visualizations dramatically shape how risks are perceived. Languagebased content may communicate one message about risk, while the visual strategies used in data visualizations may communicate a very different message. Rather than emphasizing control over the outbreak, I argue that the visual message in the infographics in this analysis communicates the opposite. Maps show Ebola breaching national (Figures 1 and 4) and international borders (Figure 2), and line graphs (Figure 3) show sharp increases in cases and deaths in Liberia and Sierra Leone. Conclusion: Warm colors increase risk perception. Further, data visualizations are high-context, collectivistic forms of visual communication, which lessen risk perception among experts but intensify risk perception among nonexperts. Technical communicators can draw from the following guidelines when constructing data visualizations that communicate risk for intercultural audiences: show quantitative information using a variety of visualization strategies, include explanatory text and/ or visuals to more fully contextualize data visualizations, and add comparative data visualizations. © 2015, Society for Technical Communication.

Using Sun’s (2012) distinction between user and practitioner localization, the researchers present a preliminary illustration of how translation is enacted by multilingual participants aiming to translate words from their heritage languages into English. Method: As part of this pilot study, ten, ten-minute interviews were conducted, video-recorded, and coded to better understand how multilingual users adapt information from their heritage languages into English. Results: Results suggest that users employ several strategies when translating in context: acting, comparing/contrasting, deconstructing, gesturing, intonation, negotiating, sketching, and storytelling. These strategies involve the use of both words and other semiotic resources (for example, gestures, intonation) to convey meaning across languages. Conclusion: Technical communication researchers and practitioners could develop more effective translation and localization frameworks by learning from the userlocalized translation practices of multilinguals. Analyzing the translation practices of multilinguals who are not professional translators or interpreters could provide a framework for technical communicators to better recognize the complexities of writing in English for international audiences. © 2015, Society for Technical Communication.

Can Desnoyers' taxonomy facilitate better interdisciplinary communication in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) fields by helping practitioners choose more efficient data visuals? In addition, would adopting Desnoyers' taxonomy bypass the current discrepancies between academic and journal data visuals? Methods: To test Desnoyers' taxonomy's impact on efficient use of data visuals, I did an exploratory, pretest/posttest survey of 101 STEM students and their choices of data visuals before and after exposure to Desnoyers' taxonomy. Results: Students chose more complex and more efficient data visuals on the posttest, after exposure to Desnoyers' taxonomy. However, level in school did not change the effect of exposure. Conclusion: Students' reported use of data visuals supports prior research about discrepancies between academic and journal data visuals. Additionally, students might benefit from having more exposure and training in efficient data visuals. Further control group studies are needed to show if Desnoyers' taxonomy itself can increase students' comprehension and use of efficient data visuals as compared to pure explanation of data visuals. If the further studies demonstrate that, then researchers and creators in the field of data visualization could confidently adopt Desnoyers' taxonomy as a way to teach and reference data visuals consistently. © 2015, (publisher).All rights reserved.","Data visuals; Graphs and charts; Interdisciplinary communication; Taxonomy; Visualization",,,,,,,,"Bartell, A.L., Schultz, L.D., Spyridakis, J.H., The effect of heading frequency on comprehension of print versus online information (2006) Technical Communication, 53 (4), pp. 416-426; Cairo, A., (2012) The functional art: An introduction to information graphics and visualization, , Berkeley, California: New Riders; Creswell, J.W., (2009) Research design: Qualitative, quantitative, and mixed methods approaches, , Los Angeles, California: Sage Publication, Inc; Desnoyers, L., Toward a taxonomy of visuals in science communication (2011) Technical Communication, 58 (2), pp. 119-134; Dragga, S., Voss, D., Cruel pies: The inhumanity of technical illustrations (2001) Technical Communication, 48 (3), pp. 265-274; Emanuel, R., Challons-Lipton, S., Visual literacy and the digital native: Another look (2013) Journal of Visual Literacy, 32 (1), pp. 7-26; Frankel, F.C., DePace, A.H., (2012) Visual strategies: A practical guide to graphics for scientists and engineers, , New Haven, Connecticut: Yale University Press; Finson, K., Pederson, J., What are visual data and what utility do they have in science education?

The research reported in this article is a first attempt to systematically explore the effects cultural adaptations of user instructions have on users. Specifically, we investigate whether Western (from Europe and North America) and Chinese (from the People's Republic of China) users would benefit from a document structure that is theoretically assumed to reflect their cultural preferences. Method: Using the SDL Trados Studio 2014 translation software package, a 2x2 experiment (N=80) was conducted with manual structure (Western versus Chinese) and cultural background (Western versus Chinese) as independent variables. The Chinese and Western manual structures were based on the literature on cultural differences between Western and Chinese technical communication. Dependent variables were task performance, knowledge, and appreciation of the software and the user instructions. Results: Contrary to our expectations, no significant differences were found between the conditions. Both Western and Chinese participants performed equally well and were equally appreciative when using the Western and Chinese manual structure. Conclusion: The results of our study raise questions about the validity and/or the relevance of the current insights regarding cultural differences in the structures of user instructions. Cultural differences found in content analytic research may reflect the habits of technical communicators rather than the preferences of users. However, caution is needed in interpreting our findings, as our research experiences also raised a number of methodological issues that must be addressed in future research. © 2015, (publisher).All rights reserved.","Chinese culture; Cross-cultural communication; Intercultural communication; Structure; User instructions; User manual",,,,,,,,"Agboka, G.Y., Participatory localization: A social justice approach to navigating unenfranchised/ disenfranchised cultural sites (2013) Technical Communication Quarterly, 22 (1), pp. 28-49; Bangor, A., Kortum, P.T., Miller, J.T., An empirical evaluation of the system usability scale (2008) International Journal of Human-Computer Interaction, 24 (6), pp. 574-594; Bangor, A., Staff, T., Kortum, P., Miller, J., Determining what individual SUS scores mean : Adding an adjective rating scale (2009) Journal of Usability Studies, 4 (3), pp. 114-123; Barnum, C., Li, H., Chinese and American technical communication: A cross-cultural comparison of differences (2006) Technical Communication, 53 (2), pp. 143-166; Barnum, C.M., Philip, K., Reynolds, A., Shauf, M.S., Thompson, T.M., Globalizing technical communication: A field report from China (2001) Technical Communication, 48 (4), pp. 397-420; Chao, M.C., Singh, N., Hsu, C.-C., Chen, I.F.N., Chao, J., Web site localization in the Chinese market (2012) Journal of Electronic Commerce Research, 13 (1), pp. 33-49; Coppola, N.W., The Technical Communication Body of Knowledge initiative: An academicpractitioner partnership (2010) Technical Communication, 57 (1), pp. 11-25; Ding, D.D., The emergence of technical communication in China-Yi Jing (I Ching) the budding of a tradition (2003) Journal of Business and Technical Communication, 17 (3), pp. 319-345; Ding, D.D., When traditional Chinese culture meets a technical communication program in a Chinese university: Report on teaching technical communication in China (2011) Technical Communication, 58 (1), pp. 34-51; Ding, D.D., Jablonski, J., Challenges and opportunities: Two weeks of teaching technical communication at Suzhou University, China (2001) Technical Communication, 48 (4), pp. 421-434; Ding, H., Technical communication instruction in China: Localized programs and alternative models (2010) Technical Communication Quarterly, 19 (3), pp. 300-317; Dragga, S., Ethical intercultural technical communication: Looking through the lens of Confucian ethics (1999) Technical Communication Quarterly, 8 (4), pp. 365-381; Duan, P., Gu, W., English for specific purposes: The development of technical communication in China’s universities (2005) Technical Communication, 52 (4), pp. 434-448; Eckert, P., Communities of practice (2006) Encyclopedia of language and linguistics, pp. 683-685. , K.

Does it give us an edge over our competitors in reaching out to people? Company executives ask these questions before allocating budgets and resources for the documentation team. A style guide is a rule-driven document that sets the parameters for consistency and acceptability of all written materials produced by an organization. But, is that the sole function of a style guide? This paper lays out key fundamentals of how to make an effective style guide and explores its benefits. The article also illustrates the process of developing a style guide in detail while satisfying the needs of the organization. Method: To understand the best practices in the industry, a comparative analysis of five style guides of global software companies was done. Further, an online survey was administered to the technical writing community to collect more information. To get first-hand feedback from professionals, seven technical writers were interviewed and discussions in online technical writing forums were facilitated. Result: In addition to generating document consistency, 82% of the survey participants concurred that an effective style guide helps in creating a distinct brand image. Word usage, new terminology, document formatting and meeting needs of global audience are important topics that need constant attention during designing a style guide. Conclusion: A style guide will have a successful impact when it is supported by management, incorporates broader inputs from all its beneficiaries, is integrated into the day-to-day operations, and is updated periodically © 2015, (publisher).All rights reserved.","Document consistency; Revision; Style guide; Translation; Updates",,,,,,,,"Allen, P.R., Save money with a corporate style guide (1995) Technical Communication, 42, pp. 284-289; Bright, M.R., Creating, implementing, and maintaining corporate style guides in an age of technology (2005) Technical Communication, 52 (1), pp. 42-51; Chapman, C., (2014) Why your brand needs a style guide, and how to create one, , http://www.webdesignerdepot.com/2014/08/why-yourbrand-needs-a-style-guide-and-how-to-create-one/; Cisco, (2014) Cisco technical documentation style guide, , http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/general/style/guide/SGAug09/stylegd.pdf.html; Griffis, G., (2013) How to make style guides that people will use, , https://blog.gathercontent.com/how-to-make-a-style-guidethat-people-will-actually-use; IBM, (2011) The IBM style guide - Conventions for writers and editors, , Boston, MA: Pearson Education, Inc; Kohl, J., (2008) The global English style guide: Writing clear translatable documentation for a global market, , Cary, NC: SAS Publishing; MacKay, P.D., Establishing a corporate style guide: A bibliographic essay (1997) Technical Communication, 44 (3), pp. 244-251; Major, D.L., Yoshida, A., Crossing national and corporate cultures: Stages in localizing a preproduction meeting report (2007) Journal of Technical Writing and Communication, 37 (2), pp. 167-181; O’Neil, J., Changing times, changing style guides (2013) Negotiating cultural encounters: Narrating intercultural engineering and technical communication, pp. 17-40. , H.

Method: This study used a modified Delphi method. To gather data, we used two sets of survey questions and two structured interviews. Results: Technical communicators are functioning as agile, adaptable, and multispecialists in a broad range of organizational functions. They have become increasingly visible and valuable assets throughout a project lifecycle, and in many cases are able to define their own roles, which include team leadership and management responsibilities. Conclusion: Technical communicators continue to serve in core functional responsibilities in a wide range of industries. © 2015, Technical Communication.

Method: This study used a modified Delphi method. To gather data, we used two sets of survey questions and two structured interviews. Results: This research helped to further explain the relationship between what technical communicators produce and how these products function in situating or framing their producers in relation to other subfields/related disciplines, such as UX design, information design, knowledge management, usability, and information architecture. Conclusion: While there is general agreement among the managers that the role of the technical communicator has to expand, there is no one clear agreed-upon strategy. Some companies are obtaining success using Agile methodology, while others are finding that this methodology, while stressing adaptability, is not easy to introduce. Corporate cultures do not change overnight. Still, integrated teams, a key component of Agile, are taking hold in most cultures. Equally important, the shift away from writing documents to directing content is well underway. The key now, as it has been for decades, is for technical communicators to highlight their value and make their contributions more visible. © 2015, Technical Communication.

Method: This study used a modified Delphi method. To gather data, we used two sets of survey questions and two structured interviews. Results: Participants valued basic technical writing skills and traditional credentialing (such as college degrees in TPC) over technical degrees or certifications. Yet they also advised that academic programs push students to develop strategic thinking and other professional skills and confidence.

Argue that documentation needs undergo a shift as users’ tasks expand beyond what is directly accommodated in the software’s design. Users no longer need stabilization knowledge (knowledge of what software is designed to do) but possibility knowledge (knowledge of what the software is capable of doing). Method: Interviews with moderators and frequent posters on four software user communities for Microsoft Excel, Adobe InDesign, Mozilla Thunderbird, and GIMP. Questions probe the participants’ sense of what makes helpful contributions on software user forums. Answers are coded thematically. Results: Moderators and frequent posters stress the importance of maintaining high quality content and high quality social interactions. High quality content is that which is credible and situationally authentic, expansive, and targeted. High quality interactions are those that effectively involve multiple members of a community and distribute responsibility for addressing user problems to those community members with the most suitable experience/expertise. Conclusions: While community members may adequately generate the necessary help content, technical communicators are needed for abilities that are also strongly associated with the profession but that often seem of secondary importance. Technical communicators may be skilled moderators who can use their genre knowledge to correct, clarify, and contextualize software problems; use their interpersonal skills to help maintain ties among members of the community; and use their knowledge of text usability and organizational communication to create infrastructure for storing and retrieving help content that is performed in the user community.","Documentation; Information architecture; Moderation; User communities",,,,,,,,"Bawarshi, A.S., Reiff, M.J., (2010) Genre: An Introduction to History, Theory, Research, and Pedagogy, , http://wac.colostate.edu/books/bawarshi_reiff/, West Lafayette, IN: Parlor Press.

Students had the options of working with engineering-related software or choosing a theoretical topic for an undergraduate English language project. Method: This practitioner case-study research is based on a mixed-methods approach. Students were asked to complete a quantitative evaluation survey, which was complemented by an analysis of students’ project reports, presentations and the teacher’s supervision log. The final reports functioned as both an assignment for marking and an evaluation of the project results. Results: In total, 14 out of 20 students returned an evaluation survey sheet. Based on the mean group rankings of statements on a five-point Likert scale (0 to 4 points), the results showed that students perceived several objectives as greatly achieved: expanding subject-specific vocabulary (3.35), working with scientific literature (3.21), following a given template for writing scientific texts (3.21), and practicing techniques of literature search (3.07). Furthermore, students found it very important that they could exercise autonomy during the project phase (3.78) and had been allowed free choice of the project topic (3.64). The five project groups submitted reports of generally good linguistic quality on different aeronautical subject areas. Conclusion: As it may be concluded from the questionnaire responses, students favored language learning through collaborative constructionist project activity and learner autonomy. A didactic framework that promotes these elements seems to be well suited for similar technical learning environments, although no direct generalizations can be made from this small-scale case study.","Constructionism; Design project; Engineering software; English language; Learner autonomy",,,,,,,,"(2012) Analysis Software and CFD Solver Package, , ANSYS® CFX, (Version 13.0) [Computer software].

This study investigates whether popular YouTube instructional videos for declarative knowledge development differ in their physical characteristics from unpopular and average ones. Method: Sampling followed a three-step procedure. First, 250 YouTube videos aiming for declarative knowledge development were selected. Next, a formula for popularity rating was developed. After distinguishing three classes of popularity, the five most viewed videos for five types of declarative knowledge were selected. This resulted in a sample of 75 videos. After coding and scoring, statistical analyses were performed to discover differences between popularity classes in the physical characteristics of videos. Results: Popular videos differed significantly from unpopular and/or average videos in the following ways: (1) higher production quality (that is, resolution); (2) more frequent presence of static pictures (both iconic and analytic); (3) more frequent presence of a combination of static and dynamic pictures; (4) more often short onscreen texts; (5) more often subtitling with different languages; (6) more frequent inclusion of background music; (7) less background noise; (8) faster speaking rate (that is, words per minute). Conclusion: The sampled videos strongly varied in their physical characteristics. There were also many significant differences across popularity classes. The findings can be used to optimize video designs for popularity. In addition, they provide a starting point for further research on how physical characteristics may affect knowledge development.","Declarative knowledge; Design characteristics; Instructional video; Popularity ratings; YouTube",,,,,,,,"(2015) 9 Insider Tips for Creating a Killer Explainer Video, , https://blog.kissmetrics.com/creating-a-explainer-video/, February 2, 2015; Anderson, L.W., Krathwohl, D.R., Airasian, P.W., Cruikshank, K.A., Mayer, R.E., Pintrich, P.R., Wittrock, M.C., (2001) A Taxonomy for Learning, Teaching, and Assessing: A Revision of Bloom’s Taxonomy of Educational Objectives, , New York, NY: Pearson, Allyn & Bacon; Arguel, A., Jamet, E., Using video and static pictures to improve learning of procedural contents (2009) Computers in Human Behavior, 25, pp. 354-359; Baylor, A.L., The design of motivational agents and avatars (2011) Educational Technology Research &Amp; Development, 59, pp. 291-300; (2015) Choosing Music for Your Video, , http://wistia.com/learning/choosing-music-for-your-video; Drew, P., (2015) Copywriting for Instructional Design Narration and Role Playing, , http://www.e-learningvoices.com/articles/copywriting.php; Ertelt, A., (2007) On-Screen Videos as an Effective Learning Tool. the Effect of Instructional Design Variants and Practice on Learning Achievements, Retention, Transfer, and Motivation, , (Doctoral dissertation), Albert-Ludwigs Universität Freiburg, Germany; Guo, P.J., Kim, J., Rubin, R., (2014) How Video Production Affects Student Engagement: An Empirical Study of MOOC Videos, , Paper presented at the The first ACM conference on Learning @ scale conference (L@S ‘14), Atlanta, GA; (2014) Here’s Why the View Count on New Youtube Videos Always Stops at 301, , http://businessetc.thejournal.ie/why-youtube-views-stop-301-1606621-Aug2014/; Höffler, T.N., Leutner, D., Instructional animation versus static pictures: A meta-analysis (2007) Learning and Instruction, 17, pp. 722-738; (2015) How to Write a Killer Explainer Video Script, , http://www.videobrewery.com/blog/how-to-write-a-killer-explainer-video-script; Kämpfe, J., Sedlmeier, P., Renkewitz, F., The impact of background music on adult listeners: A meta-analysis (2010) Psychology of Music, 39 (4), pp. 424-448; (2015) Make a Good Video Script Great in 5 Steps, , http://www.sitepoint.com/make-a-good-video-script-great-in-5-steps/; Mayer, R.E., Principles of multimedia learning on social cues: Personalization, voice and image principles (2005) The Cambridge Handbook of Multimedia Learning, pp. 201-212. , R.

I delineate the components of product review quality in order to assist technical communicators who manage their organizations’ usergenerated content in identifying quality content and in helping reviewers produce quality content. Method/Corpus: I analyze results from secondary research on product reviews and discuss six important components of review quality. I focus most attention on five components of review quality that technical communicators can assess— informativeness, valance, credibility, conformity, and readability—and briefly describe a sixth component—user characteristics. I also exemplify these components, drawing from a corpus of 8,973 product reviews gathered in 2013 from a variety of retail and review websites. Results: Based on this analysis, I recommend strategies that technical communicators can use (1) to identify these components of review quality, (2) to develop a rich data set from which they can glean consumer wants and needs as well as trends related to their organizations’ products, and (3) to help reviewers write better reviews. Conclusions: As the amount of user-generated content grows, the need to learn from it and the need to improve it grow. By using their knowledge and skills in new ways, technical communicators who manage and develop product reviews can stay relevant and necessary as organizations rely more and more heavily on user-generated content.","Credibility; Informativeness; Product reviews; Quality; Readability; Usergenerated content",,,,,,,,"Multi-channel, rich, and social: Exploring the illustrative edge of Adobe Technical Communications 2.0 (2011) ISTC Communicator, , https://www.adobe.com/go/tcstechillustration, Adobe Systems Inc; Baumeister, R.F., Bratslavsky, E., Finkenauer, C., Vohs, K.D., Bad is stronger than good (2001) Review of General Psychology, 5 (4), pp. 323-370; Cao, Q., Duan, W., Gan, Q., Exploring determinants of voting for the “helpfulness” of online user reviews: A text mining approach (2011) Decision Support Systems, 50 (2), pp. 511-521; Chevalier, J., Mayzlin, D., The effect of word of mouth on sales: Online book reviews (2006) Journal of Marketing Research, 43 (3), pp. 345-354; Connors, L., Mudambi, S.M., Schuff, D., Is it the review or the reviewer?

The study serves to bridge the gap between theoretical research of rhetoric and the needs of business communication practitioners by identifying the means of persuasion that can be used by online crowd funding entrepreneurs. Method: Qualitative analysis of thirteen crowd funding project descriptions posted on a major Web Error! Hyperlink reference not valid. rhetorical techniques via text coding. The sample included the most-funded projects to date, one from each of the thirteen project categories on Kickstarter. Aristotle's concept of ethos, pathos, and logos served as a basic framework for developing a more detailed classification of rhetorical means of persuasion used in the projects. Results: The most-funded projects have been found to contain all three types of rhetorical appeals (ethos, pathos, and logos), subdivided into a total of twelve specific subtypes most commonly encountered in the descriptions from the sample. The subtype definitions have been developed and refined over the course of several reviews. Conclusion: The research data made it possible to create a ""rhetorical profile"" of a successful crowd funding project description representing a summary of the rhetorical techniques identified during the study. Although this summary reflects a hypothetical all-inclusive case, it can be used as a benchmark when drafting crowd funding project descriptions. The study also identified specific directions for future research that could determine the influence of project description rhetoric on donor decisions.","Crowd funding; Crowdfunding; Marketing communication; Persuasion; Practical rhetoric",,,,,,,,"Andersen, P.H., Relationship development and marketing communication: An integrative model (2001) Journal of Business and Industrial Marketing, 16 (3), pp. 167-182; (1954) Rhetoric, , Aristotle, Book 1, Chapter 2 (W.

Method: Literature search Results: The paper presents a brief survey of the studies contained in this resource, and discusses the answers of the knowledge base to an exemplary question about the comprehensibility of passives. Conclusion: The knowledge base makes research on comprehension accessible that is relevant for both practitioners and researchers in the field of technical communication.

This article is part of a larger study investigating technical communication through activity theory. Method: The study utilizes autoethnographic interview data to explore and analyze some of the issues technical communicators are currently facing, and how these issues affect their expectations for the future. The literature of the field is used to further illustrate the points made. Results:User-centeredness is widely recognized as one of the main quality factors in technical communication, but the current work processes of the field do not allow technical communicators access to users or user data. The interviewees are not satisfied with their current work conditions and fear for the future of the field. Conclusion: It is discovered that while we are currently facing serious problems, there is still a need for user advocates in the product development process.

Changing technology clearly played a key role in the evolution of instruction. Finally, Web design instruction included some level of reference to cognitive learning theory or visual communication theory. While the appearance of theory-based word units in Web design texts coupled with discussion about technological capabilities and audience suggests Web design instruction does a solid job of situating design practices in theory, technology, and the complex situations in which the Web user operates, the depth of discussion varies greatly from text to text.Conclusion: The various treatments of theory in texts calls for further study to better understand which approach is more effective in communicating the theories as a whole as well as their application in Web design.Purpose: To investigate whether Web design rules historically are prescribed or whether designers are encouraged to think critically about how Web design choices relate to the complex situation of human-computer interaction. Specifically, this study explores how Web design rules have evolved since the mid-1990s and the influencing factors, if Web design instruction has dictated rules or encouraged designers to think critically about the design decisions being made, and, finally, if Web design principles are based on cognitive learning or visual communication theories, situated in best practices, or simply replicated.Method: Content analysis of a sampling of 40 textbooks and general-interest publications on Web design from 1995 to 2014. © 2014, Society for Technical Communication.

Therefore, the focus in our explorative study is to understand these perspectives and attitudes to aid in the development of technology and technical communication curriculums for preservice teachers.Results: Preservice teachers’ educational experiences with technology and technical communication show a strong preference for using Microsoft PowerPoint to convey course content. However, a major theme from their perspectives and attitudes was negative toward formal PowerPoint communication training. Furthermore, participants stressed the over reliance on PowerPoint in the classroom; they desired more creativity and better ways of communicating course content.Conclusion: This study provides evidence worthy of serious reflection on the reality that there is a significant issue in teacher education curriculum today and the ineffective use and instruction of technology and technical communication in educational settings. © 2014, Society for Technical Communication.

Because few publically available, authentic examples exist, I first explore the general characteristics of 55 tests and 71 error types. Error types are correlated against 176 professionals’ perceptions of these error types.Method: The sample’s characteristics were first identified from the tests and the hiring managers. Three raters then independently classified the errors types using coding schemas from previous taxonomies of college-level writing. Finally, a 24-question survey was administered to capture professional communicators’ perceptions of error.Results: Editing tests were typically designed in narrative format and evaluated holistically, but variation in administration and format existed. The sample included 3,568 errors and 71 error types. Errors related to wrong words, spelling, and capitalization dominated, but 13 other errors were frequently found as well as dispersed within at least 50% of the sample. Conversely, professionals were bothered most by apostrophe errors, homonyms, and sentence fragments. No significant correlations were found among the frequencies and dispersions of the editing tests’ errors and the professionals’ perceptions of those errors.Conclusions: Editing tests share common characteristics, but organizational context substantially influences its format and contents. There were consistencies between the editing test error types and types identified in college-writing taxonomies; however, context again influences why errors are introduced as well as the types of errors that were identified. Finally, hiring managers and professionals share different perceptions of error. Understanding these differences can produce better assessment tools and better prepare test takers. © 2014, Society for Technical Communication.

The employees scored their attitudes regarding motivation, ability, safety climate, and safety performance.Purpose: One of the major challenges for modern organizations is to create healthy and safe work environments, as evidenced by the number of occupational deaths (worldwide: four per minute), and an even higher number of injuries. This study explores different levels of motivation and ability, to identify which are most relevant for safety climate and safety performance. This study aims to pinpoint the areas information designers should focus on to most effectively contribute to healthy and safe work environments.Results: The results confirmed the expected relationship between safety climate and safety performance. Of the explored sublevels of motivation and ability, personal motivation and external ability proved most relevant for creating a healthy safety climate and healthy safety performance.Conclusion: In the design of safety instructions, focusing on personal motivation and external ability seems a promising strategy for contributing to healthy and safe work environments, especially in high-risk environments. © 2014, Society for Technical Communication.

This study addresses the gap by asking managers about the extent to which they track two measures of value—productivity and effectiveness—as well as the expectations of sponsors for receiving reports on these issues.Method: A survey of corporate communication, training, and technical communication groups was conducted. Participants were recruited through local chapters of the STC and the American Medical Writers Association. Ninety technical communication managers responded.Results: The evidence suggests that activities for tracking productivity by technical communication managers are limited. Technical communication groups rarely solicit feedback and perceptions on individual communication products and employ usability testing on a limited basis. Technical communicators rarely track return on investment (ROI). Technical communication managers feel limited pressure to report productivity and effectiveness. The most significant criteria against which the productivity and effectiveness of technical communication groups is assessed is word of mouth. The evidence only partially supports this entering belief: Customer surveys play an important role in assessing general impressions of technical communication products.Conclusions: These results are consistent with earlier studies and suggest that despite a discussion about means of assessing the productivity and effectiveness of technical communicators that has spanned over a quarter of a century, none of the methods of assessment has reached wide use. The study also suggests that perceptions are the most significant factor in assessing the value of technical communication products and services, and should be given more focus in future research and writing on this topic. © 2014, Technical Communication.

The purpose of the article is to explore the similarities between moderators of help forums and technical communicators. The article argues that technical communicators are uniquely suited to step in as “community managers” of companies’ official online help forums.Method: This study reports on qualitative research done with 23 help forum moderators. The researcher used an iterative grounded theory approach to seek out research participants and code the interview data to examine emergent data categories. The research was also supplemented by six months of observation and an extensive memoing process.Results: The interviews with forum moderators show that help forum moderation requires many of the skills technical communicators already possess. Moderators play an important role in the health of online help forums, and they must be able to work with subject-matter experts, edit content, organize material, create content, and shape the overall tone of the forum.Conclusion: Many companies now sponsor official help forums, and these companies need community managers to run these sites. The data reported in this study show that technical communicators possess the skills to succeed in these positions and help develop professional online help forums. In conclusion, technical communicators have a strong case to make that they are well positioned to step in as community managers, especially of professionally sponsored online help forums. © 2014, Technical Communication.

From our interest in this trend as well as our aims to bridge workplace and classroom contexts, we conducted a case study of the networked interactions of key actors involved in iFixit’s Technical Writing Project, as enacted in a technical writing classroom at a state university.Method: From Latour’s definition of an actor as a component of a network capable of impacting other components, we conducted a qualitative case study examining the interactions of technical writers, technical writing students, technological devices, tools, and wiki technologies during students’ completion of the Technical Writing Project. In particular, we examined how these actors exerted rhetorical impacts on one other during students’ writing processes.Results: The results of our study were that the Technical Writing Project asked students to assemble a complex rhetorical situation that involved technical knowledge-making as well as assembling both human and nonhuman actors to create high-quality documentation. Further, this documentation was created in a situation strongly influenced by both workplace realities and the interactions enabled by an open source wiki that allows for contributions by interested Internet users.Conclusion: We believe our study on the reciprocal impacts of both human and nonhuman actors in the context of a learning project that spans workplace and classroom context calls for new models of rhetoric that better account for networked knowledge-making. © 2014, Technical Communication.

The historical case of Port Chicago-a failed relationship of a military facility and its neighboring civilian community-offers important lessons regarding the nefarious practice of erasive rhetoric and the missed opportunities for cultivating cooperation and communication. Method: A critical review of historical records and pertinent communications from military and civilian sources uncovers a series of rhetorical practices damaging to the safety, identity, and vitality of a community. Results: The language practices of name-changing, dismissive and derogatory descriptions, passive voice, negative claims, tactical omissions, and elaborate pejorative detail, separately and collectively, serve to fortify the source of danger while erasing the object of danger. Conclusion: This provocative and still timely case challenges technical communicators to bring together officials from military, industrial, and transportation facilities with the residents of neighboring cities for instructive and productive interactions that generate trust, save lives, and preserve communities.","Community; Dangerous neighbors; Erasive rhetoric; Risk communication; Safe distance; Taking",,,,,,,,"(1949) The New York Times, , $390,000 given heirs in coast war blast, March 5); Allen, R.L., (2006) The Port Chicago Mutiny, p. 1989. , Berkeley, CA: Heyday Books.

Method: I surveyed and interviewed seven technical communicators who worked remotely as consultants for large U.S. corporate organizations, including two Fortune 500 financial services companies, a professional services firm, and a safety certification organization. No participant performed more than 15% of her work on-site. Each participant had a minimum of three years' experience working remotely and had previous experience working as an on-site technical communicator for other organizations. The surveys and follow-up interviews provided qualitative data, which I then coded and analyzed. Results: Unlike local technical communicators, who may have limited contact with their end-user audience, these remote technical communicators had no direct contact with their end-user audience and instead relied on other in-house and remote team members (such as project managers) to provide audience information. The remote technical communicators reported facing challenges such as lack of social interaction; inability to stop working; and a lack of information and resources. They reported using various skills and strategies to cope with challenges, citing communication, selfdiscipline/motivation, and organization/structure the most frequently. Conclusion: Given the trend of organizations choosing to outsource writing and training jobs and hire consultants to take on these roles, technical communicators should acquaint themselves with the potential challenges of working on a remote team. Study participants reported such challenges as difficulty building trusting, new relationships; missing out on small talk and sometimes even critical conversations; and feeling isolated.","Challenges; Consultants; Project teams; Remote; Technical communicators",,,,,,,,"Alexander, M., How to lead remote teams (2012) New Zealand Management, p. 57; Barker, T., Poe, K., The changing world of the independent: A broader perspective (2002) Technical Communication, 49 (2), pp. 151-153; Blakeslee, A.M., (2001) Interacting With Audiences: Social Influences On the Production of Scientific Writing, , Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates; Blakeslee, A.M., Addressing audience in a digital age (2010) Digital Literacy For Technical Communication: 21st Century Theory and Practice, pp. 199-229. , In R.

A set of dedicated guidelines for the construction of such tutorials was recently advanced in Technical Communication (Van der Meij & Van der Meij, 2013). The present study set out to assess the cognitive and motivational effects of a video tutorial based on these guidelines. Method: Participants were 65 students (mean age 12.0 years) from elementary school. The procedure was as follows. First, students completed a pre-test. Next, they viewed videos and completed practice tasks. Finally, students completed a post-test and retention-test. Results: The pre-test revealed low scores on task relevance, and low initial task performance. During training, students reported positive mood states, high flow, and significantly higher task relevance than in pre-testing. Task performance rose significantly during training, and was also substantially higher on the post-test and retention-test than in pre-testing. Only cognitive factors significantly predicted task performance. Conclusion: The effectiveness of the video tutorial attests to the quality of the design guidelines on which it was based. The critical contribution of specific guidelines are a potential area for further research.","Cognition; Job-aid; Learning; Motivation; Tutorial; Video instructions",,,,,,,,"Agrawala, B., Li, W., Berthouzoz, F., Design principles for visual communication (2011) Communications of the ACM, 54 (4), pp. 60-69. , doi: 10.1145/1924421.1924439; Bandura, A., (1997) Self-efficacy. the Exercise of Control, , New York, NY: Freeman and Company; Brunyé, T.T., Taylor, H.A., Rapp, D.N., Spiro, A.B., Learning procedures: The role of working memory in multimedia learning experiences (2006) Applied Cognitive Psychology, 20, pp. 917-940. , doi: 10.1002/, acp.1236; Carroll, J.M., (1990) The Nurnberg Funnel.

The issue also investigates how approaches such as developing taxonomies, engaging communities of practice, and constructing framing metaphors can inform the evolution and content strategy for a body of knowledge or an organization-specific knowledge base. Method: Reviewing the literature on developing bodies of knowledge and consulting with academics and practitioners on specific developmental goals and objectives for the TCBOK led us to posit three areas for focused investigation: constructing information taxonomies, engaging users and developers as a community of practice, and employing conceptualizing metaphors that can guide development without sacrificing complexity. Results: The articles' explorations of content strategy, information taxonomies, and user engagement are shown to be relevant for developing both company-specific information standards and field-wide bodies of knowledge. We leave open the question of whether use of conceptualizing metaphors belong more to construction of a BOK than to a set of standards. Conclusions: The TCBOK is a healthy, maturing collaborative project, which perhaps indicates we have matured as a field, and explains who we are and what we do as a field. It articulates the boundaries of knowledge in our field and the value added to the profession. Continued development and maintenance of TCBOK will benefit from continuing research into the relationship that professions sustain between their body of knowledge and disciplinary practices in the field and in the academy.","Body of knowledge; Conceptualizing metaphors; Information standards; Knowledge bases; User engagement",,,,,,,,"(2012) Raise the bar for engineering, , http://www.raisethebarforengineering.org/engineering-bodies-knowledge, ASCE, Retrieved from; Bloom, B.S., Engelhart, M.D., Furst, E.J., Hill, W.H., Krathwohl, D.R., (1956) Taxonomy of educational objectives: Handbook I: Cognitive domain, , New York: David McKay; Bourque, P., Dupuis, R., Abran, A., Moore, J.W., Tripp, L., The guide to the software engineering body of knowledge (1999) Focus, pp. 35-44. , (Nov./Dec.); Coppola, N., The technical communication body of knowledge initiative: An academicpractitioner partnership (2010) Technical Communication, 57, pp. 11-25; Coppola, N.W., Elliot, N., Conceptualizing the technical communication body of knowledge: Context, metaphor, and direction (2013) Technical Communication, 60, pp. 267-278; (2013) SWEBOK Guide, version 3, , http://www.computer.org/portal/web/swebok/v3guide, IEEE Computer Society., Retrieved from; Kline, J., Barker, T., Negotiating professional consciousness in technical communication: A community of practice approach (2012) Technical Communication, 59, pp. 32-48; (2013) PMBOK Guide and Standards, , http://www.pmi.org/PMBOK-Guide-and-Standards.aspx, Project Management Institute (PMI)., Retrieved from; Rainey, K.T., Approaches to professionalism: A codified body of knowledge (2005) International Professional Communication Conference (IPCC) Proceedings, pp. 679-688. , Limerick, Ireland: IEEE Professional Communication Society; Rainey, K.T., Turner, R.K., Dayton, D., Do curricula correspond to managerial expectations?

To support next-generation development efforts, a framework is proposed that will benefit the profession: integration with national efforts to develop knowledge taxonomies; conceptualization through metaphor; and application through imagined user groups (personas) and the communication tasks (genres) they commonly perform. Method: As an instrumental case study, the TCBOK can be understood and expanded through the complementary metaphors of relation and trading zones. Both metaphors are examined through a scenario of use for two personas. Results: While presently designed as taxonomy of knowledge, the TCBOK might be expanded through an ecological framework that embraces complexity of design and use. Conclusions: Three recommendations are provided that may help provide direction for TCBOK development: (1) Continue the use of persona as a key strategy for information development, but add high-quality genre models of best practice; (2) Expand attention from focus on cognitive competency domains to include intrapersonal and interpersonal domains; (3) Consider the knowledge portal as an opportunity to expand on other current efforts to articulate knowledge taxonomies.","Genre; Metaphor; Persona; Professionalism; TCBOK",,,,,,,,"(2013) A guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK(R) Guide), , American National Standards Institute., (5th ed.), Washington, DC: American National Standards Institute; Bernard, H.R., (2013) Social research methods: Qualitative and quantitative approaches, , (2nd ed.), Los Angeles, CA: Sage; Blakeslee, A.M., Spilka, R., The state of research in technical communication (2004) Technical Communication Quarterly, 13, pp. 73-93; Brady, M.A., Schreiber, J., Static to dynamic: Professional identity as inventory, invention, and performance in classrooms and workplaces (2013) Technical Communication Quarterly, 22, pp. 343-362; Brennan, R.L., (2006) Educational measurement, , (Ed.)., (4th ed.), Westport, CT: American Council on Education/Praeger; (2013) Occupational outlook handbook, , http://www.bls.gov/ooh/, Bureau of Labor Statistics, Washington, DC.

Method: To develop a sustainable content strategy for the body of knowledge project, informed by content analysis, user generated survey data, and benchmarked trends from other knowledge bases. Results: An important part of content strategy for a large-scale knowledge base, such as the TCBOK, involves innovating practices with regard to the information taxonomy, tools, content assets, and information development standards, as the product and user base matures. Successful technical communication knowledge bases employ taxonomies with higher level topics that represent specific disciplines and subdisciplines within technical communication. Integrating the human user into content strategy involves a complex interplay of user expectation and feasible decision making. Conclusions: Developing a body of knowledge, particularly over time, may require an integrated or hybrid approach to content strategy, involving a complex set of factors that include the human user, content assets, and sustainable practices. Content strategy goals and objectives are also a function of the maturity of the user base and the content itself within a body of knowledge.","Body of knowledge; Content management; Content strategy; Information taxonomies and tools; Knowledge base; User engagement",,,,,,,,"Baehr, C., (2007) Web development: A visual-spatial approach, , Upper Saddle River, NJ: Prentice Hall; (2013) Society for Technical Communication, , http://www.stc.org/education/certification/certification-main, Certification., Retrieved from; Clark, D., Content management and the separation of presentation and content (2008) Technical Communication Quarterly, 17, pp. 35-60; Coppola, N., The technical communication body of knowledge initiative: An academicpractitioner partnership (2010) Technical Communication, 57, pp. 11-25; Dalkir, K., (2011) Knowledge management in theory and practice, , (2nd ed.).

This improved social capital leads to tacit knowledge sharing. Method: The proposed theoretical model is grounded in previously published research on organizational social capital and communities of practice, relevant literature, and survey research. The authors examine aspects of their previous research in social media and communities to build a theoretical model. Results: The theoretical model shows the congruent outcomes that occur when using social media to establish communities of practice to address the problem of sharing tacit knowledge within an organization. Conclusions: Communities of practice can form an important bridge between social media technology and people within an organization.

This article explains how the content development community at IBM created meaningful standards, as well as the metrics to track their impact, as part of a closed-loop information quality process. Method: Instead of having one group dictate what the standards will be, the content developers at IBM worked together as a community to identify key requirements from internal and external sources, tested the standards with a set of key products, and then put the standards to use in increasingly larger numbers of products. Results: A community-driven approach to information quality standards allowed the IBM content developers to create standards that were meaningful to a variety of teams, ensuring that key aspects of information quality were addressed throughout the corporation. The use of metrics to track implementation and compliance allowed the IBM community to see when the standards were working, and when the standards needed to be updated to meet the changing needs of their clients. Conclusions: Implementing information quality standards is an admirable goal, but it should not be the end of a company's information quality journey. This should be considered a closed loop or wheel, with continual analysis of compliance data, client feedback, and other metrics driving continual improvements in information quality.","Community; Information quality; Metrics; Standards; User experience",,,,,,,,"Ames, A., Bailie, R., Riley, A., (2012) Point:Counterpoint, , http://intdev.stc.org/2012/02/point-counterpoint/, Retrieved from; Ames, A., Riley, A., Jones, E., Telling the right story: Proving the business value of content (2013) Intercom, 60 (5), pp. 33-39; Eberlein, K., Anderson, R., Joseph, G., (2010) Darwin Information Typing Architecture (DITA) 1.2 specification, , http://docs.oasisopen.org/dita/v1.2/spec/DITA1.2-spec.html, Retrieved from; Hargis, G., (2004) Developing quality technical information: A handbook for writers and editors, , (2nd ed.), Upper Saddle River, NJ: IBM Press; (2008) ISO/IEC FDIS 26514:2008(E)-Systems and software engineering-Requirements for designers and developers of user documentation, , http://www.iso.org/iso/catalogue_detail?csnumber=43073, International Organization for Standardization., Retrieved from; Writing Standards, , http://intercom.stc.org/write-for-intercom/writing-standards/, Society for Technical Communication.

We added verification steps and personal stories to user instructions for a cell phone, to find out how seniors (between 60 and 70 years) perceive these confidence-increasing motivational elements. Verification steps allow users to check if a procedure was carried out correctly. Personal stories describe how a fictitious user succeeded in completing a procedure. Method: The plus-minus method was used. Participants were asked to place pluses and minuses in cell phone user instructions to indicate their positive and negative reading experiences, and to explain their choices afterwards. Results: Verification steps are regarded as other, common parts of user instructions by seniors. Nineteen out of 20 participants appreciate verification steps, and they mainly encourage providing these because they are expected to decrease doubts, and increase user confidence and satisfaction. Personal stories tend to stand out compared to other, common parts of user instructions. Thirteen out of 20 participants appreciate personal stories, which use is mainly discouraged for redundancy reasons, and encouraged for their expected positive effects on user confidence and motivation. Conclusion: The use of verification steps and personal stories in user instructions seems acceptable to seniors. As a next step, it seems worth it to test for effects of these motivational elements on usability, user confidence and motivation.","Confidence; Motivation; Plus-minus method; Seniors; User instructions",,,,,,,,"Bandura, A., (1986) Social foundations of thought and action: A social cognitive theory, , Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice Hall; Bandura, A., (1997) Self-Effcacy: The Exercise of Control, , New York, NY: W.H.

With video rapidly becoming a major instructional method, the question arises of their effectiveness for software training. This paper provides a set of eight guidelines for the construction of instructional videos for software training. Method: The guidelines present a concise view on how to design an instructional video for software training. They are based on a considerable body of research on how people process visual and verbal information and how to support these processes. Each guideline is described, illustrated, and supported with research findings from various disciplines. Results: The guidelines were tested in three consecutive empirical studies. In these studies a set of instructional videos for Word's formatting options were designed. The effects of the video instructions were compared with a paper tutorial (Van der Meij & Van der Meij, in preparation). We found that the video instructions yielded more favorable appraisals for motivation, higher skills proficiency immediately after training, and better skills retention after a one-week delay. Conclusions: The guidelines offer patterns that could further advance the theory and practice of the design of instructional videos for software training. A limitation of the study is that we concentrated on instructional video that serve a tutorial function. For video that function as a reference guide not all the guidelines are equally important, and also some new guidelines may be called for.","Procedural support; Software tutorials; Streamlined step; Video instruction",,,,,,,,"Alexander, K.P., The usability of print and online video instructions (2013) Technical Communication Quarterly, 22, pp. 237-259; Amadieu, F., Mariné, C., Laimay, C., The attention-guiding effect and cognitive load in the comprehension of animations (2011) Computers in Human Behavior, 27, pp. 36-40; Ambard, P.D., Ambard, L.K., Effects of narrative script advance organizer strategies used to introduce video in the foreign classroom (2012) Foreign Language Annals, 45 (2), pp. 203-228; Atkinson, R.K., Renkl, A., Merrill, M.M., Transitioning from studying examples to solving problems: Effects of self-explanation prompts and fading worked-out steps (2003) Journal of Educational Psychology, 95, pp. 774-783; Ausubel, D.P., (1968) Educational psychology: A cognitive view, , New York, NY: Holt, Rinehart & Winston; Bannert, M., The effects of training-wheels and self-learning materials in software training (2000) Journal of Computer Assisted Learning, 16, pp. 336-346; Baylor, A.L., The design of motivational agents and avatars (2011) Educational Technology Research & Development, 59, pp. 291-300; Bethke, F.J., Dean, W.M., Kaiser, P.H., Ort, E., Pessin, F.H., Improving the usability of programming publications (1981) IBM Systems Journal, 20, pp. 306-320; Bovair, S., Kieras, D., Toward a model of acquiring procedures from text (1991) Handbook of reading research, pp. 206-229. , In R.

The goal is to determine whether explicit instruction in minimalism can help students (and practitioners) apply such principles and heuristics to the genre of Web app videos and aid in invention within emergent documentation scenarios. Method: An instructional method was used in this study, specifically the introduction of minimalist documentation concepts and heuristics to instructional video production. This study compares assessment rubrics completed by students as pre- and post-test assessment data, though the success of the instructional method is not dependent upon these results. Results: After working with minimalism heuristics, student-produced videos showed greater attention to imperative mood language, task-orientation, and error representation than existing videos for Web applications. Though student-produced videos lacked production polish, they showed evidence of minimalist strategies. Conclusions: Minimalist documentation strategies can be successfully taught and applied to short videos designed to entertain, encourage, inform, and instruct potential users while enabling them to engage the Web application with more knowledge.","Instruction manual; Minimalism; Multimedia; User documentation; Video",,,,,,,,"Amazon Kindle 6inch Quick Start Guide, , http://kindle.s3.amazonaws.com/Kindle_6inch_Quick_Start_Guide.PDF, Amazon.com.

The goal of this method is to offer a time- and cost-effective instrument that enables organizations to easily classify an audience's interest in environmentalism, assess their willingness to listen to and accept environment-related messaging, and pinpoint the commonplace elements likely to be most useful in constructing environment-related communication. Method: I developed the interview, coding sheet, instructions for completing the process, and glossary that make up the Deep Audience Analysis instrument from existing data presented elsewhere (Ross 2013, 2012, 2008), and refined the instrument through both participatory design and usability testing. Results: The results of my testing suggest that the Deep Audience Analysis tool I propose is both valid and reliable, but training with the instrument would prove beneficial, and triangulation with multiple coders is optimal. Organizations adopting this method of audience analysis would do well to practice with the instrument and have norming sessions before putting the instrument to use in the field. Conclusion: The audience analysis instrument I propose here includes an interview script, code sheet, instructions for completing the process, and glossary. The method proposed here should serve as a time- and cost-effective paper-based strategy for organizations wishing a deeper understanding of their audience(s).","Audience analysis; Environmental communication; Environmental rhetoric; Organizational communication",,,,,,,,"Albers, M.J., Multidimensional audience analysis for dynamic information (2003) Journal of Technical Writing and Communication, 33, pp. 263-279; Alberty, C., (1987) A Step Beyond Audience Analysis: A Writer's Awareness of Audience While Composing, , Society for Technical Communication Annual Conference Proceedings.

However, a Web site that is usable in terms of navigation can still have credibility issues that reflect negatively on an organization. As a result, Website credibility assessments have gained popularity, but little research in that area has examined one of the most common forms of Web site communication-that is, small business Web sites that do not pose risk and do not offer e-commerce. This paper begins to address that gap by exploring the relationship between Web visitor expectations and their credibility judgments about a small business based on its Web site. Method: I conducted research based on principles of Prominence Interpretation Theory of Web credibility. This research included focus groups of likely consumers to explore the relationship between Web visitor expectations and judgments about the small business Web site and credibility judgments about the small business. Data from the focus groups was used to: (1) determine the factors that women use when setting expectations and making credibility judgments about a small business based on their Web experiences, and (2) identify if those factors vary generationally. Results: The results of the research revealed that likely consumers of the small business did not believe the Web experience projected a credible brand with which they would want to engage. In other words, a Web site that was intended to promote the products and the store was ironically hurting the business by turning away potential customers. Conclusion: I show how a six-step credibility test (based on Prominence- Interpretation Theory principles) can be used by communications consultants, Web site developers, and small-business owners. Such a test is an effective yet simple approach to gauging Web credibility judgments and making sustainable Web site changes in organizations with limited resources. The ease of this test combined with the time- and cost-effectiveness make it especially useful for small business Web sites, where expertise and resources may be limited.","Drupal; Open source web content management systems; Prominence-interpretation theory; Usability; Web site credibility; Wix; Wordpress",,,,,,,,"Barnum, C.M., (2011) Usability Testing Essentials: Ready, Set, Test!

Method: We used course catalogs to analyze the curricula of 65 programs that offer majors in TPC. We employed qualitative inquiry methods based primarily on textual analysis and the deployment of codes to assign a summative attribute for course types. Results: We located 185 undergraduate programs in TPC in the U.S. that offer majors, concentrations, emphases, tracks, and specialization, a 131% increase from the 2005 study, and restricted our analysis to 65 programs that offered majors in TPC. Degree programs no longer are predominately housed in English departments. The most significant gain is to the number of programs housed in Technical Communication Programs. The majority of programs require 30-36 hours of credit. A set of ""core courses"" are emerging in the field-wide curricula. There is a significant increase in the number of programs requiring document/information design, Web, internship, and capstone courses. In contrast, few require literature courses. Conclusion: Curricular data show an emerging consensus on the core courses and elective courses within undergraduate curricula. In addition, for the first time, the field has data to assess trends over time.","Core courses; Trends in U.S. curricula; Undergraduate degree programs",,,,,,,,"Allen, J., Hundleby, M., (2010) Assessment in technical and professional communication, , Amityville, NY: Baywood; Academic catalog, , https://webapp4.asu.edu/catalog/Home.ext, Arizona State University.

This family of tools includes wikis, online word processors, learning management systems (LMSs), and other collaborative tools. The data gathered were used to illustrate these tools' value to practitioners, as well as provide educators with recommendations about which tools to teach students. Method: Surveys were deployed to technical communication practitioners and students; each group had its own survey. The surveys gathered quantitative and qualitative data. The qualitative data were analyzed through a coding system. Results: Roughly 85% of both groups used OCWTs; however, practitioners used them daily while students used them only weekly. Practitioners primarily used tools chosen by their companies, and their most-used tools were Microsoft SharePoint, Google Docs, and company intranet. Students were features driven, and their mostused tools were Google Docs, PBWorks (formerly PBWiki), and Blackboard. Both groups had positive opinions overall about OCWTs. Conclusion: Technical communication practitioners appear to be using these tools often in the workplace, and several OCWTs appear to have become standards. These tools seem to hold value for practitioners, who use them for a wide variety of collaborative tasks. Technical communication students and educators should be aware of the OCWTs and collaborative tasks found in industry so that students can learn them. These tools include wikis, online word processors, and SharePoint (or something similar, such as an LMS). Finally, some tasks that practitioners perform (single sourcing, project management, and so forth) appear unfamiliar to students- it would be beneficial if students learned to perform these tasks in the classroom.","Collaborative writing; Digital collaboration; Groupware; Pedagogy; Wikis",,,,,,,,"Brown, K.M., Huettner, B., James-Tanny, C., (2007) Managing virtual teams: Getting the most from wikis, blogs, and other collaborative tools, , Plano, TX: Wordware Publishing; Hughes, M.A., Hayhoe, G.F., (2008) A research primer for technical communication, , New York, NY: Lawrence Erlbaum; Jones, S.L., How we collaborate: Reported frequency of technical communicators' collaborative writing activities (2007) Technical Communication, 54, pp. 283-294; Lundin, R.W., Teaching with wikis: Toward a networked pedagogy (2008) Computers and Composition, 25, pp. 432-448; Ray, D.S., Ray, E.J., Matching collaboration technologies to team needs: Accommodating document management and communication goals (2000) Technical Communication, 47, pp. 122-126; Rice, J.A., Devising collective knowledges for the technical writing classroom: A course-based approach to using Web 2.0 writing technologies in collaborative work (2009) IEEE Transactions on Professional Communication, 52, pp. 303-315; Salopek, J.J., Digital collaboration (2000) Training & Development, 54 (6), pp. 37-43; Tharp, T.L., 'Wiki, wiki, wiki-WHAT?'

Method: An interdisciplinary group of researchers at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute selected five disparate examples of technology-mediated communication, formally evaluated each using contemporary heuristics, and then engaged in an iterative design process to arrive at an expanded toolkit for in depth analyses. Results: A set of heuristics and operationalized metrics for the deeper analysis of a broader scope of contemporary technology-mediated communication. Conclusions: The continual evolution of communication, including the emergence of new, interactive media, provides a challenging opportunity to identify effective approaches and techniques. There are benefits to a renewed focus on relationships between people and between people and information, and we offer additional criteria and metrics to supplement established means of heuristic analysis.","Assessing usability; Design heuristics; Technology-mediated communication; Usability metrics; Usability toolkit",,,,,,,,"Alessi, S.M., Trollip, S.R., (2000) Multimedia for learning: Methods and development, , New York, NY: Allyn & Bacon; Anderson, C., (2006) The long tail: Why the future of business is selling less of more, , New York, NY: Hyperion; Benbunan-Fich, R., Hiltz, S.R., Mediators of the effectiveness of online courses (2003) IEEE Transactions on Professional Communication, 46, pp. 298-311; Bennett, A., (2012) Engendering interaction with images, , Bristol, UK: Intellect; Bolter, J.D., Gromala, D., (2003) Windows and mirrors: Interaction design, digital art, and the myth of transparency, , Leonardo.

Method: The study surveyed an international sample of 240 independent technical communicators who maintain Web sites to market their services, and interviewed a subset of survey respondents. Results: Overall, participants perceived their Web site's information about both their business and themselves to be somewhat useful in marketing their services, though they were also divided about which of these two types was the more useful. Regardless of whether their business comprised just themselves or a larger corporation with associates, some participants foregrounded their business's identity to build credibility whereas others foregrounded their own and their associates' personal identities to build rapport. Conclusion: ""About us"" information about a business and about its people can be usefully conceived as two distinct types of information, each deployed selectively to serve distinct purposes. Among the factors that may influence whether and how a technical communication business would foreground a corporate face or a personal face are not necessarily its corresponding corporate or personal status but instead the business's industry, its location internationally, its size, and the qualifications and gender of its people.","""About us"" information; Ethics; Independent contractors and consultants; Self-representation; Technical communication companies; Web sites",,,,,,,,"Ahern-Connolly, C., Broadway, S.C., The importance of appearing competent: An analysis of corporate impression management strategies on the World Wide Web (2007) Public Relations Review, 33, pp. 343-345; Allen, D.G., Mahto, R.V., Otondo, R.F., Web-based recruitment: Effects of information, organizational brand, and attitudes toward a Web site on applicant attraction (2007) Journal of Applied Psychology, 92, pp. 1696-1708; Boyle, K., Johnson, T.J., MySpace is your space?

Students experienced a ""workplace context"" within their university classroom (replete with timeline challenges, requisite managerial decisions, and assignment delegation). Methods: Students' performance on required course documentation and ability to satisfactorily complete course goals were examined, and exit interviews were conducted and analyzed through the lens of theoretical frameworks offered by Cook (2002) and Blakeslee (2001) and correlated to previous research. Results: Students in the course described developed new literacies (per Cook) and participated in a process of gradual exposure, experiencing ""exposure, authenticity, transition, and response"" as Blakeslee (2001) stresses, to professional, workplace communication genres. Conclusions: This client project can serve as one model for the kind of bridge for which Blakeslee et al. have called. A critical part of any bridge is its two ""destinations,"" so our study points to both footings of such a structure-academic learning modules and workplace practices-both of which must be further explored by technical communication faculty and the technical communication professionals with whom they collaborate and with whom they confer about university program efficacy.","Client projects; Enculturation; Layered literacies; Publications management; Workplace preparedness",,,,,,,,"Blakeslee, A.M., Bridging the workplace and the academy: Teaching professional genres through classroom-workplace collaborations (2001) Technical Communication Quarterly, 10, pp. 169-192; Cook, K.K., Layered literacies: A theoretical frame for technical communication pedagogy (2002) Technical Communication Quarterly, 11, pp. 5-29; Cooke, L., Williams, S.D., Bringing realworld projects into the college classroom (2003) Society for Technical Communication Annual Conference Proceedings, , http://www.stc.org/ConfProceed/2003/PDFs/STC50-037.pdf; Ford, J.D., Bracken, J.L., Wilson, G.D., The two-semester thesis model: Emphasizing research in undergraduate technical communication curricula (2009) Journal of Technical Writing and Communication, 39, pp. 433-454; Ford, J.D., Newmark, J., Emphasizing research (further) in undergraduate technical communication curricula: Involving undergraduate students with an academic journal's publication and management (2011) Journal of Technical Writing and Communication, 41, pp. 311-324; Ford, J.D., Newmark, J., Lanier, C.R., Writers among engineers and scientists: New Mexico Tech's bachelor of science in technical communication (2012) Undergraduate writing majors: Nineteen program profiles., , (Forthcoming).

There is far less knowledge about Web design for children. For the first time, an overview is presented of the current design conventions for children's informational Web sites. Method: In this study a large corpus of 100 children's international, informational Web sites from four different domains (science, pets, arts, and health) is analyzed. The instrument for analyzing the Web sites included categories on visual design, navigation and information architecture. Results: The design conventions identified in this study show that designers of children's informational Web sites often follow general Web design guidelines. This study also shows that there is still much confusion about how to design Web sites for children. A closer look at the data revealed three categories of informational Web sites especially designed for children, diverging from a classical to a playful design approach. Conclusion: An overview is presented of the current design conventions for children's informational Web sites. The identified design conventions should be further tested and validated as design standards for children's informational Web design. Further, the design of children's informational Web sites is determined by two dimensions of aesthetics; classical and expressive. In this study, expressive aesthetics results in playful visual design or in a total playful interaction design. The effects of playful design on children's affect and cognition will be an important topic in future research on children's digital search behavior.","Children; Information architecture; Interface design; User experience; Web design conventions",,,,,,,,"Adkisson, H., (2002) Identifying de-facto standards for e-commerce Web sites., , (Unpublished Master's thesis).

Method: The study employed qualitative inquiry methods based primarily on textual analysis and the deployment of codes to assign a summative attribute for course types. Results: The field presently offers 110 certificates, which represents a growth rate of 186% for graduate certificates and a growth rate of 191% for undergraduate certificates. Conclusion: Certificate curricular data show that, unlike other degree programs, there is still no consensus on what a certificate should be and what courses should be required. Questions are offered to help the field start conversations about certificates.","Academic certificates; Graduate degree programs; Trends in U.S. curricula; Undergraduate degree programs",,,,,,,,"Allen, I.E., Seaman, J., (2011) Going the distance: Online education in the United States, , 2011.

Provide a set of best practices for creating and delivering video based on analysis of existing, highlyrated content on YouTube. Method: Assessment of a criterion-based (that is, software type) sample of 46 instructional videos stratified by user ratings. Inductive coding of shared withingroup (that is, ""good,"" ""average,"" ""poor"" rating) features, including genre conventions, rhetorical work, and communication design qualities. Results: Good instructional videos share qualities that appear to account for their strong user ratings and distinguish them from average and poor videos. Good videos spend significant time introducing an instructional agenda and forecasting goals and steps. In this manner, they function like video equivalents of printed documentation. Good videos also focus on demonstrative content, in which steps are both performed and explained or elaborated. By contrast, videos with lower ratings focus as much or more on simply doing the steps without explaining or explaining without doing. Good videos were also designed so that their instructional messages could be easily identified and accessed, easily understood and applied, and so that the messages were engaging and encouraging. Conclusions: Designers of instructional video can successfully apply lessons learned from the design of instructional content for print while taking into account the medium-specific affordances and constraints of video and sound. The potential for rapid, viral distribution via social media channels should also inform the selection and design of instructional content.","Assessment; Communication design; Help documentation; Instructional video",,,,,,,,"Albers, M.J., Human-information interaction (2008) Proceedings of the 26th annual ACM international conference on Design of communication SIGDOC 08, pp. 117-124. , http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1456536.1456560, SIGDOC '08, Retrieved from; Bandura, A., Self-efficacy: Toward a unifying theory of behavioral change (1977) Psychological Review, 84, pp. 191-215; Bishop, M.J., Cates, W.M., Theoretical foundations for sound's use in multimedia instruction to enhance learning (2001) Educational Technology Research and Development, 49 (3), pp. 5-22; Clark, R.C., Mayer, R.E., (2008) e-Learning and the science of instruction: Proven guidelines for consumers and designers of multimedia learning, , (2nd ed.).

The issue is how to develop an understanding of what grant-making agencies want and effectively communicate with target audiences. Method: Applying modality analysis, based on pedagogical theories focused on learning styles, to publications from a funding source involves identifying words that are associated with visual, auditory, or kinesthetic orientations. Matching the identified communication style/modality of the funding source can enhance communication and funding success. Results: Experience with grant proposals that use rhetorical approaches that are based on modality analysis of agency publications can attain more success than other submissions. Conclusion: A grant writer can base his/her selection of rhetorical approaches on modality analysis, which seems to be a viable way to make one's grant proposal text connect with the values, priorities, and communication preferences of a funding source, and this connection enhances chances for success.","Grant writing; Learning styles; Modalities; Rhetoric",,,,,,,,"Atkinson, C., (2005) Beyond bullet points: Using Microsoft® PowerPoint® to create presentations that inform, motivate, and inspire., , Redmond, WA: Microsoft Press; Bauer, D.G., (1999) The ""how to"" grants manual: Successful grant seeking techniques for obtaining public and private grants., , Phoenix, AZ: The American Council on Education and The Oryx Press; Bizzell, P., Herzberg, B., (2001) The rhetorical tradition: Readings from classical times to the present., , (Eds.).

Researchers have noted that interactions between two parties who are nonnative users of the language employed for the encounter are peppered with understanding problems. This study looks into the causes of understanding problems in helpdesk encounters between nonnative speakers of English and the techniques those interacting parties used to resolve or prevent flaws in the conversation. Method: Conversation analysis was used to analyze 25 recorded phone calls, amounting to 750 minutes of data, made in a commercial call center and in the helpdesk of an international academic institute in Enschede, the Netherlands. Results: Analysis of the phone calls reveals that causes of understanding problems between an agent and a caller who are nonnative users of English go beyond asymmetries in their proficiency with the language. Factors such as incomplete information or erroneous inference from the utterance of the partner in the interaction are important triggers for the occurrence of understanding problems. Consequently, call center agents and callers use varied repair and preventative techniques to ensure that understanding problems will not impede the attainment of the primary goal of the encounter- to resolve the product-related problem of the caller. Conclusion: While understanding problems are inevitable in helpdesk encounters, especially those that involved nonnative users of the language employed for the interaction, such problems are hardly attributable to the linguistic differences characterizing interacting parties. It is apparent that helpdesk agents and callers are equipped with varied techniques to resolve understanding problems or to prevent their inception.","Conversation analysis; Helpdesk encounters; Misunderstanding; Non-understanding",,,,,,,,"Agliati, A., Vescovo, A., Anolli, L., Conversation patterns in Icelandic and Italian people (2005) The hidden structure of interaction: From neurons to culture patterns, pp. 223-235. , In L.

These models not only affect revenue but, because generating revenue is central to the survival of an organization, affects all other operations. Method: Applies the theory of business models from the management literature to technical communication groups, using descriptions of technical communication groups from empirical studies to identify the most common business models for these groups and suggests how the source of revenue affects operations. Results: Technical communication groups typically fall into one of these models: (a) Venture Capital Model-groups that produce content published for sale; (b) Design Model-groups that design the architecture and oversee implementation of Web sites, large information campaigns, user interfaces, and designed-in information; (c) Agency Model-groups that produce marketing communication, employee communication, and other high profile content; (d) Development Shop Model-groups that support a strategic effort by developing help, user's guides, reference manuals, and similar product information; (e) Technical Support Model-groups that produce materials for internal users; and (f) Contractor Model-groups that update documentation for products and services have long life cycles (often lasting for decades). Although the literature on technical communication advocates for the Design model, most technical communication groups operate under the Development Shop, Technical Support, and Contracting Models, as well as mixed models. Conclusions: This theory does not prescribe actions technical communication groups should take to change their status; rather it describes why technical communication groups in different organizations might have different experiences.","Business models; Management; Power and influence; Value",,,,,,,,"Afuah, A., Tucci, C., (2000) Internet Business Models & Strategies: Text and Cases, , New York, NY: McGraw-Hill Higher Education; Albers, M., Design considerations for complex problem-solving (2002) Proceedings of the 49th Society for Technical Communication Annual Conference, , Arlington, VA: STC; (1992) Text Label for Permanent Exhibition, , American Advertising Museum, Portland, OR; Ames, A., Advanced toolkit for experienced technical communicators: Whose UI is it, anyway?

Therefore, we focus in our explorative study on users' handling and evaluation of such software, including a comparison between educational and business users. Method: A total of 1014 participants (51% female, 49% male) took part in a web-based study. Among them were 444 students and 570 employees from different fields. The online questionnaire consisted of 67 questions in three parts and was based on the current literature and ratings of five experts. Results: Our results show a strong preference for using Microsoft PowerPoint, which led to rather satisfied users. Computer-based presentations are mainly used in educational settings, talks, and meetings. Differences between students and employees were identified, with the latter showing a broader use. Furthermore, independent of occupation, participants stressed the importance of usability aspects such as ease of use, compatibility, or loading speed; however, they equally desired more creativity in computer-based presentations and better speakers. Conclusions: The process of slide generation seems to be patchwork, and a large amount of time is spent on design and animation; thus we recommend measures to reduce the time spent on matters of visual style. In addition, current presentation software still suffers from several usability issues. Generally, the central function of the speaker and the supporting role of the presentation software are to be stressed.","Computer-based presentations; Evaluation; PowerPoint; Presentation software; Usage",,,,,,,,"Amare, N., To slideware or not to slideware: Students' experiences with PowerPoint vs. lecture (2006) Journal of Technical Writing and Communication, 36, pp. 297-308; Apperson, J.M., Laws, E.L., Scepansky, J.A., An assessment of student preferences for PowerPoint presentation structure in undergraduate courses (2008) Computers & Education, 50, pp. 148-153; Bartsch, R.A., Cobern, K.M., Effectiveness of PowerPoint presentations in lectures (2003) Computers & Education, 41, pp. 77-86; Brier, D.J., Lebbin, V.K., Perception and use of PowerPoint at library instruction conferences (2009) Reference User Services Quarterly, 48, pp. 352-361; Burke, L.A., James, K.E., PowerPoint-based lectures in business education: An empirical investigation of student-perceived novelty and effectiveness (2008) Business Communication Quarterly, 71, pp. 277-296; Burke, L.A., James, K.E., Ahmadi, M., Effectiveness of PowerPoint-based lectures across different business disciplines: An investigation and implications (2009) Journal of Education for Business, 84, pp. 246-251; Clarke, D.S., What's the point?

As my organization discovered, few resources exist explaining the considerations involved in such an initiative, and there was a noted lack of information to help us plan for human-based factors affecting its success. This article attempts to fill that gap by relating our experiences. Method: We first monitored the CMS to understand its use by our organization's authors. Next, we conducted a survey to understand their perceptions of the system. We then made changes to the system based on the answers gathered in the survey. Finally, we monitored the system's use once more after the changes were made. Results: Our study suggested that authors did not want to use the new system because they were insecure in using it, perceived it as too difficult to use, and were unfamiliar with the system (among other issues). We then implemented a more familiar interface, created a version control system allowing them to revert to previous versions if they made mistakes, and created and deployed Web-based video tutorials. Finally, we tracked a noted increase in the use of the system by our authors. Conclusion: Based on our experience, for future technical communicators considering a CMS, I suggest involving those affected as soon as possible, implementing tools that are familiar, providing multiple methods of training, and creating mechanisms to ease anxiety about mistakes and errors.","Content management system; Distributed authors; Human factors; Organizational change",,,,,,,,"Alavi, A., Leidner, D., Review: Knowledge management and knowledge management systems: Conceptual foundations and research issues (2001) MIS Quarterly, 25, pp. 07-136; Albers, M., The technical editor and document databases: What the future may hold (2000) Technical Communication Quarterly, 9, pp. 191-206; Anderson, R., The rhetoric of enterprise content management (ECM): Confronting the assumptions driving ECM adoption and transforming technical communication (2008) Technical Communication Quarterly, 17, pp. 61-87; Dayton, D., Electronic editing in technical communication: A model of user-centered technology adoption (2004) Technical Communication, 51, pp. 207-223; Goodwin, S., Burford, N., Bedard, M., Carrigan, E., Hannigan, G.C., CMS/CMS: Content management system/change management strategies (2006) Library Hi Tech, 24, pp. 54-60; Hackos, J.T., (2002) Content Management for Dynamic Web Delivery, , New York, NY: John Wiley; Hart-Davidson, W., Bernhardt, G., McLeod, M., Rife, M., Grabill, J.T., Coming to content management: Inventing infrastructure for organizational knowledge work (2008) Technical Communication Quarterly, 17, pp. 10-34; Huttenlock, T.L., Beaird, J.W., Fordham, R.W., Untangling a tangled web: A case study in choosing and implementing a CMS (2006) Library Hi Tech, 24, pp. 61-68; Jones, C.P., Mitchko, J., Overcash, M., Case study: Implementing a content management system (2002) Proceeding of the Annual Summit of the Society for Technical Communication, pp. 221-224. , Arlington, VA: STC; Kahn, R.L., The effects of technological innovation on organizational structure: Two case studies on the effects of the introduction of a new technology on informal organizational structures (2000) Journal of Business and Technical Communication, 14, pp. 328-347; McKeever, S., Understanding web content management systems: Evolution, lifecycle and market (2003) Industrial Management & Data Systems, 103, pp. 686-692; Nakano, R., (2001) Web Content Management: A Collaborative Approach, , Boston, MA: Addison-Wesley; Rogers, E.M., (1995) Diffusion of Innovations, , (4th ed.).

Method: Content analysis of 10 practitioner blogs, focusing on professional topics of status, education, professional societies, and the effects of technology. Results: Although the bloggers under study appear to function as an effective community of practice, they are not currently directing their actions or attention toward the traditional goals of professionalization, such as licensing and accreditation. Conclusions: The latent themes that emerge show that many of the goals of professionalizing (such as standardizing routes into the field and increasing respect for the work) are also concerns of practitioners.","Blogs; Content analysis; Education; Professional societies; Professionalization; Status; Technology",,,,,,,,"Anscheutz, L., Rosenbaum, S., Expanding roles for technical communicators (2002) Reshaping Technical Communication: New Directions and Challenges for the 21st Century, pp. 149-164. , In B.

Method: Proposes that prevailing approaches to professionalization are rooted in theories of occupations, the exclusive right to perform a job. True occupations have such rights legally; aspiring occupations like ours are disciplines. Common components of an infrastructure for occupations include professional organizations, bodies of knowledge, education, professional activities, and certification. Results: Disciplines often establish these in anticipation of becoming an occupation, but some practicing professionals interpret and use them differently, resulting in a spectrum of approaches to professionalization. At one end of the spectrum is formal professionalism, which views professionalization as a stepping stone to full occupational status. It is rooted in a worldview that values expertise and sees the infrastructure of an occupation supporting the development of expertise and controlling access to the profession. In the center of the spectrum is quasiprofessionalization, in which individuals participate in the activities of the occupational infrastructure but without the expectation of exclusive rights to perform the work. Quasiprofessionalization is rooted in professional identity. At the other end of the spectrum is contraprofessionalization, which refers to initiatives that offer or promote professional services outside of parts of or the entire infrastructure, sometimes circumventing it completely. This world view is rooted in market theory and characterized by concepts like do-it-yourself (DIY), usergenerated, and subject matter expert (SME)-provided documentation. Conclusions: The differing views suggest tensions regarding support for specific efforts to professionalize technical communication, including formal branding of the profession, establishment of certification, and support for professional organizations.","Branding of technical communication; Certification; Professionalization",,,,,,,,"Astd, C.I., (2010) No One Asked Me to Do It. the CPLP is About Me, , http://www.astd.org/content/ASTDcertification/, Retrieved from; Astd, C.I., (2009) Looking to Be the Best?

Method: To develop a structured collaboration model based on Wenger's three dimensions for establishing a community of practice: joint enterprise, mutual engagement, and shared repertoire. Results: Structured collaboration shows strong potential to nurture a community in which the specific professional identity of being an academic or a practitioner is minimized in favor of the negotiated identity of being a community member working toward mutual goals. Conclusions: Effective collaboration between the academic and practitioner communities creates a negotiated professionalism through better research, better education, and a more comprehensive body of knowledge.

Methods: Content analysis of 10 practitioner blogs, focusing on professional topics of status, education, professional societies, and the effects of technology. Results: Although the bloggers under study appear to function as an effective community of practice, they are not currently directing their actions or attention toward the traditional goals of professionalization, such as licensing and accreditation. Conclusions: The latent themes that emerge show that many of the goals of professionalizing (such as standardizing routes into the field and increasing respect for the work) are also concerns of practitioners.","Blogs; Content analysis; Education; Professional societies; Professionalization; Status; Technology",,,,,,,,"Anscheutz, L., Rosenbaum, S., Expanding roles for technical communicators (2002) Reshaping Technical Communication: New Directions and Challenges For the 21st Century, pp. 149-164. , In B.

Method: The study surveyed 240 independent contractors, consultants, and principals of small businesses that maintain Web sites to market their technical communication services, briefly interviewed half of them, and analyzed posted samples of their work. Results: Results reveal the extent to which posted work samples are useful in marketing technical communication services, and how the numbers of such samples are associated with their overall usefulness. Results also reveal how independent technical communicators overcome such challenges as clients' concerns about proprietary information, confidentiality, and intellectual property in order to post their work. Conclusion: These results carry implications not only for how independent technical communicators disseminate a portfolio of their work but also for how any technical communicators would develop portfolios of their work for employment, academic credentials, or professional certification.","Independent contractors and consultants; Intellectual property; Portfolios; Web sites",,,,,,,,"Anderson, P.V., What survey research tells us about writing at work (1985) Writing In Nonacademic Settings, pp. 3-83. , In L.

It proposes an alternative structure based on readeroriented research. Method: Two card-sorting studies were used to identify reader expectations. In a closed card-sorting study, participants were provided with scenario questions on medication use and were asked under which of the template headings they expected to find information on each question. In an open sorting task, the schemata of patient information leaflet readers were explored. In this study, participants sorted a large set of sentences that can be found in actual patient information leaflets. Results: The closed card-sorting study reveals that users provided with the EU template structure do not always look at the correct section when searching information about patient situations. The results of the open card-sorting study indicate that readers prefer the following structure: goal of the medicine - directions for use - potential problems - packaging and storage. Conclusion: Card-sorting data help to evaluate and design text structures for genres such as patient information leaflets. The European template does not match users' expectations concerning the leaflet's structure. There is a mismatch between the wording of headings and reader interpretations. A second mismatch has to do with classifying and grouping information. Patient information presented in the alternative format may be expected to improve reading performance.","Card sorting; Evaluation; Patient information; Reader expectations; Structure",,,,,,,,"Askehave, I., Zethsen, K.K., Communication barriers in public discourse (2003) The patient package insert.

Specific guidelines on how to create effective visual arguments that are useful as slides meant for presentations cannot be used as handouts. Method: The criteria were derived primarily from Doumont's (2002) three laws of professional communication that suggest how to combine rhetorical and visual elements to form coherent arguments. Results: The results show that Doumont's laws are helpful in judging the persuasiveness of the students' visual arguments. In addition, the weaknesses in the students' visual arguments applied to all three laws, which is in line with Doumont's view that the laws have an order of precedence. Conclusion: The guidelines in this paper can help practitioners convert their slides into handouts more effectively and encourage teachers to spend more time teaching visual argument in the classroom.","Arguments; Doumont's three laws of professional communication; Technical communication handouts; Visual arguments; Visual communication",,,,,,,,"Alley, M., (2009) Rethinking the Design of PowerPoint Slides: The Assertion-evidence Structure, , http://writing.engr.psu.edu/slides_body.html, Retrieved March 29, from; Alley, M., Neely, K.A., Rethinking the design of presentation slides: A case for sentence headline and visual evidence (2005) Technical Communication, 52, pp. 417-426; Amare, N., Manning, A., The language of visuals: Text + graphics = visual rhetoric (2007) IEEE Transactions On Professional Communication, 50, pp. 57-70; Atkinson, C., (2005) Beyond Bullet Points: Using Microsoft® PowerPoint® to Create Presentations That Inform, Motivate and Inspire, , Redmond, CA: Microsoft Press; Birdsell, D.S., Groarke, L., Toward a theory of visual argument (1996) Argumentation & Advocacy, 33, pp. 1-10; Blair, J.A., The rhetoric of visual arguments (2004) Defining Visual Rhetorics, pp. 41-61. , C.

This study investigates whether color as a Web site element can serve as a trustworthiness cue. In addition, the context of these Web sites was taken into account as research indicates that emotions associated with colors might differ between contexts. Method: An experimental study was conducted in which first impressions of trustworthiness of Web sites were measured in relation with the chosen color scheme. More than 200 participants evaluated eight finance, eight legal, and eight medical Web sites on perceived trustworthiness. Each respondent was presented with an identical Web site that only differed on the used color scheme. Four different color schemes (red, blue, green, and black) were put to the test. Result: The findings indicate that when the same Web site is presented using different color schemes, the Web sites are considered to have different levels of trustworthiness. Color has a statistically significant but limited effect, compared with all other reasons people can have to trust a Web site. Overall, the blue color scheme was perceived as most trustworthy and black as least trustworthy. The effect of the context is statistically significant, but very small. Conclusion: The color-trustworthiness relationship has never been demonstrated in the context of Web sites.

This study provides a view into how students make comments during a comprehensive edit of a technical document. Method: Undergraduate technical editing students performed a comprehensive edit of a report. Data were derived from the editorial comments students made during the edit. Comments were coded for level of the comment (global, paragraph, or sentence), phrasing of the comment, and quality of the comment. A total of 132 comments were coded. Results: Both effective and ineffective commenting habits were observed. Students were found to make a high percentage of paragraph-level comments and a low percentage of global and sentence-level comments. Most of the comments were rated as useful to an author. Looking at specific problem areas, most students missed commenting on four major problems within the text. The students seemed to be using a linear editing style of simply moving through the document from beginning to end, rather than using a top-down editing style or multiple passes. Conclusions: When given instructions to perform a comprehensive edit, most students made comments that addressed global and paragraph-level issues, rather than sentence-level or copyediting issues. However, the overall quality and usefulness of the comments varied widely. As part of improving both writing and editing skills, technical communication pedagogy needs to focus more on overall document structure and how to structure sections within a document.","Comprehensive editing; Editing comments; Editing pedagogy; Editor-author relationship",,,,,,,,"Albers, M.J., The technical editor and document databases: What the future may hold (2000) Technical Communication Quarterly, 9, pp. 191-206; Albers, M.J., The future of technical communication: Introduction to this special issue (2005) Technical Communication, 49, pp. 267-272; Allen, L., Voss, D., Ethics for editors: An analytical decision-making process (1998) IEEE Transactions On Professional Communication, 41, pp. 58-65; Anderson, S.L., Campbell, C.P., Hindle, N., Price, J., Scasny, R., Editing a web site: Extending the levels of edit (1998) IEEE Transactions On Professional Communication, 41, pp. 47-57; Bereiter, C., Scardamalia, M., (1987) The Psychology of Written Composition, , Hillsdale, NJ: Erlbaum; Buren, R.V., Buehler, M.F., (1980) The Levels of Edit, , 2nd ed.).

Method: Qualitative research was used in this study, specifically a case study based on ethnological methods including interviews, observations, and collection of relevant documents. Results: Localization of the social and physical spaces that surround organizational training spaces includes recognizing their potential function as an important site for professional communication, especially in relationship-oriented cultures such as Japan. Beyond the need for this conceptual understanding, localization of organizational training also requires the practical navigation of these spaces. Such facility depends on professional communicators' understanding of proxemics, or the human use of space in cultural contexts, as well as wise reliance on the guidance of cultural insiders. Conclusions: When professional communicators work to localize organizational training, they must include all relevant communication channels and work to actively manage the physical and social spaces through which relationships are built and information is passed. An awareness of how space is used as a means of communication across cultures is essential.","Localizationreferences; Organizational training; Proxemics; Relationships",,,,,,,,"Abela, A., (2008) Advanced Presentations By Design: Creating Communication That Drives Action, , Francisco, CA: Pfeiffer; Aiello, J.R., Human spatial behavior (1987) Handbook of Environmental Psychology, , In D.

Method: Five open questions were asked of the university's five technical communication instructors in a 90-minute focus-group interview session to identify the important areas in pedagogy as conditioned by Chinese culture. The 300 students were surveyed to reveal their understanding of technical communication as it existed in China. Features as conditioned by Chinese culture and as manifested in the 300 students were also identified through my teaching and observing their performance in class. Results: The five instructors taught the same lessons and the same course content determined by the university. They focused on teaching professional terms and phrases. They administered examinations throughout a semester to help students memorize the terms. The 300 students generally thought that technical communication was about science and technology. The general audience of technical communication, for them, was basically their country, and the purpose was to serve their country and society. In class, these students often studied through collaboration in groups; they memorized almost everything from their professor; and they preferred a broad thinking style to tackling broad issues. Conclusions: Technical communication pedagogy is governed by Confucianism and the test-oriented Chinese society. In class, students were motivated by the collectivism Chinese culture stresses. Students' rote learning approach was influenced by their traditional way of learning, and the broad thinking style was a textual mechanism for students to complete assignments while upholding patriotism.","Broad thinking style; Collectivism; Confucianism; Rote learning; Technical communication",,,,,,,,"Anderson, P., (2010) Technical Communication: A Reader-centered Approach, , 7th ed.).

Method: The article explicates and illustrates Bergson's theory of social and dynamic moralities (i.e., ethics as regulation of cooperative individuals and ethics as inspiration by heroic individuals) and offers a critical reading of three corporate codes of conduct from the perspective of this theory, emphasizing five factors: language emphasizing cooperation versus compliance, identification of authorship, clarity of ethical versus legal obligations, inclusion of humanizing pictorial images, and coverage of heroic individuals. Results: None of the corporate codes of conduct examined truly exploit the immense rhetorical power of narrative or illustrations. None exclusively emphasize cooperation or entirely specify authorship. None are altogether lucid or consistent in separating legal and ethical issues. Existing practices yield a missed opportunity to inspire as well as stipulate ethical behavior. Conclusion: Technical communicators are skilled in rhetoric, studied in ethics, and experienced in writing policies and instructions and in soliciting information from sources of knowledge and power. Technical communicators could thus be uniquely qualified to develop dialogic codes of conduct for corporations, industries, and professions.","Code of conduct; Ethical; I-thou relationships; Legal; Verbal-visual communication",,,,,,,,"Adams, J.S., Tashchian, A., Shore, T.H., Codes of ethics as signals for ethical behavior (2001) Journal of Business Ethics, 29, pp. 199-211; Barton, B.F., Barton, M.S., Simplicity in visual representation: A semiotic approach (1987) Journal of Business and Technical Communication, 1, pp. 9-26; Barton, B.F., Barton, M.S., Ideology and the map: Toward a postmodern visual design practice (1993) Professional Communication: The Social Perspective, pp. 49-78. , In N.

Method: Cross-sectional sample survey of 1,000 STC members conducted in May 2008; multiple survey contacts by email with link to online survey instrument. Results: Of 276 respondents, half reported using SS/CM methods and tools. About 1 in 10 respondents reported experience with a failed implementation of SS/CM; half the SS/CM users reported significant downsides or tradeoffs. Perceived top drivers of SS/CM adoption were faster development, lower costs, regulatory and compliance pressures, and translation needs. About 1 in 9 respondents used Darwin Information Typing Architecture (DITA). Large company size made use of SS/CM significantly more likely, and work groups using single sourcing with content management were significantly larger than work groups of other SS/CM subgroups and non-users of SS/CM. Single sourcing without content management seems destined to achieve a larger proportion of adopters than single sourcing with content management, barring a technology breakthrough. Among all respondents, Microsoft Word and FrameMaker were the most-used primary authoring tools. Conclusions: With regard to these methods and tools, STC members appear to be in the Early Majority phase of Everett M. Rogers's innovation adoption curve. Diffusion of these methods and tools appeared to have been steady in the five years prior to the survey, with no dramatic increase in more recent pace of adoption.","Content management; Methods and tools; Single sourcing; Survey methods; Technology transfer",,,,,,,,"Ament, K., (2003) Single sourcing: Building modular documentation, , Norwich, NY: William Andrew Publishing; Babbie, E.R., (2007) The practice of social research, , 11th ed.

Not only do children represent a growing segment of Internet users, much of what they do online has a specifi c purpose: education. To help technical communicators create educational Web sites for children, we offer a set of guidelines to direct the design process. Method: Nine children participated in a usability test of the CARES Playground, an educational Web site geared toward 7- to 9-year-olds. The site was designed by a group of graduate students in professional writing based on a review of the (admittedly limited) literature dealing with designing Web sites for children. This paper matches common themes from existing literature to the results of the usability tests. Results: Since all the information on designing Web sites for children emerged from the literature of designing Web sites for adults, the themes of navigation, appearance, and content are not unfamiliar. However, the interpretation of those common issues for children-as well as the children's reaction to them-may be surprising. Conclusion: Technical communicators need to be conscious and deliberate when designing Web sites for children. To ensure that educational Web sites are able to meet their learning goals, careful consideration of children's developmental abilities and Web preferences must be considered. We present several guidelines as a starting point, though further research is needed to confi rm and expand upon them.","Children; Design guidelines; Usability; Web sites",,,,,,,,"Bernard, M., Mills, M., Frank, T., McKown, J., Which fonts do children prefer to read online?

Method: By using Actor Network Theory (ANT) to look specifically at instances involving digital rights management (DRM) issues in the United States and the European Union, we can discover how content distribution is as much an issue of protecting intellectual property as it is a critical concern for usability. Results: Amazon's response to the removal of Orwell's books, Hulu's expiration of content, and Pandora's copyright restrictions cause numerous issues for consumers attempting to access this content legally. Conclusion: As communicators, legal experts, and international policy contributors, it is imperative that we design for these experiences, rather than over and around them. Looking across these networks-documenting what technologies, organizations, and people are involved-we can create a better map of what is or will be affected by any further implementation of law or technology. By participating in spaces typically thought of as the realm of legal scholars, policy makers, and lawyers, technical communicators can be stronger user advocates for the participants of these systems.","Digital rights management; Experience design; International communication; Social media; Usability",,,,,,,,"Albers, M.J., The future of technical communication (2005) Technical Communication, 52, pp. 267-272; Allen, J., The case against defining technical writing (1990) Journal of Business and Technical Communication, 4, pp. 68-77; Allen, P., Rip, mix, burn...sue...ad infinitum: The effects of deterrence vs. voluntary cooperation on non-commercial online copyright infringing behavior (2008) First Monday, 13 (9); (2009) Kindle product page, , http://www.amazon.com/Kindle-Wireless-Reading-Display-Generation, Amazon; (2009) Comment #29 [Online forum comment], , http://boingboing.net/2009/07/17/amazon-zapspurchase.html#comment-544611, Anonymous, July 17, Retrieved from; Arnab, A., Hutchinson, A., Fairer usage contracts for DRM (2005) Proceedings of the 5th ACM workshop on Digital Rights Management, , Alexandria, VA: ACM; Bezos, J., (2009) An apology from Amazon [Online forum comment], , http://www.amazon.com/tag/kindle/forum/ref=cm_cd_ef_tft_tp?_encoding=UTF8&cdForum=Fx1D7SY3BVSESG&cdThread=Tx1FXQPSF67X1IU&displayType=tagsDetail, July 23, Retrieved from; Boyle, J., (2008) The public domain: Enclosing the commons of the mind, , New Haven, CT: Yale University Press; (2009) Comment [Online forum comment], , http://www.amazon.com/tag/kindle/forum/ref=cm_cd_search_res_ti?_=UTF8&cdForum=Fx1D7SY3BVSESG&cdMsgNo=7&cdPage=1&cdSort=oldest&cdThread=Tx1QUP1NLUY4Q5M&cdMsgID=Mx1DPQ8OB4X8ITD#Mx1DPQ8OB4X8ITD, Caffeine Queen, July 16, Retrieved from; Callon, M., Some elements of a sociology of translation: Domestication of the scallops and the fishermen of St Brieuc Bay (1986) Power, action, & belief.

Method: We open by considering how technical communicators live, work, and do research in global contexts where distributed networks for the design, development, and distribution of documents, interfaces, and technologies span cultural and geographic borders. By drawing on published case work and interviews with technical communicators who work in global contexts, we examine the key legal and ethical issues technical communicators face when they are conducting Internet research. We propose heuristics for technical communicators to use when addressing these issues. Results: Key legal and regulatory issues that technical communicators face when conducting Internet research include the diversity of legal regimes, the variability of privacy laws and cultural differences, the impact of government surveillance on research risks, and the complexity of intellectual property in a global world. Conclusion: Technical communicators need to be aware of the potential legal and regulatory challenges they may encounter when conducting Internet research that spans cultural and geographic borders. By consulting precedent cases, seeking advice from diverse audiences (e.g., focal participants, corporate legal), and remaining flexible in research design, technical communicators can successfully meet these challenges.","Globalization; Intellectual property; Internet research ethics; Law; Privacy",,,,,,,,"(2009) Permissions and trademark guidelines, , http://www.adobe.com/misc/agreement.html, Adobe, Retrieved from; (2009) Terms of use, , http://www.adobe.com/misc/copyright.html, Adobe, Retrieved from; (1981) African charter on human and peoples' rights, , http://www.achpr.org/english/_info/charter_en.html, African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights, Retrieved from; Allen, L., Voss, D., (1997) Ethics in technical communication: Shades of gray, , New York, NY: Wiley; (2009) Code of ethics, , http://cms.english.ttu.edu/attw/organization/code-of-ethics, Association of Teachers of Technical Writing (ATTW), Retrieved from; Boyle, J., The second enclosure movement and the construction of the public domain (2003) Law and Contemporary Problems, 33, pp. 33-74. , http://www.law.duke.edu/journals/66LCPBoyle, Retrieved from; Bruckman, A., Studying the amateur artist: A perspective on disguising data collected in human subjects research on the Internet (2002) Internet research ethics, , http://www.nyu.edu/projects/nissenbaum/ethics_bruckman.html, In Charles M.

However, the most vulnerable audience-the participants-is left out of the conversation. The purpose of this article is to examine the influence of legal and cultural contexts on participant-directed informed consent documentation. Such examination will help technical communicators make informed consent documentation more user-centered. Method: Using excerpts from informed consents that I translated into Russian, examples from my six years as a localization specialist, and an overview of contradictory U.S., Russian, and international laws, I analyze the legal, ethical, and cultural considerations for informed consent documentation in international clinical trials. Results: The results of this analysis show that international regulations often differ from U.S. and Russian laws. In addition, the culture and way of life in the country where a clinical trial originates (e.g., the United States) might differ from those in the country where the trials are conducted (e.g., Russia). These differences influence the comprehension of information in informed consent documentation and a patient's decision to take part in a clinical trial. Technical communicators are often responsible for the difficult task of reconciling the contradictory issues raised in international clinical trial legislation, differences in legal systems of particular countries, and tensions between law and culture. Conclusion: I offer strategies that technical communicators can adapt to work in the best interests of their audience and to present user-centered information in informed consent documentation.","Audience; Informed consent; International clinical trial; International regulations; Law and culture; User-centered design",,,,,,,,"Appelbaum, P., Clarifying the ethics of clinical research: A path toward avoiding the therapeutic misconception (2002) American Journal of Bioethics, 2, pp. 22-23; Bailey, W., Cruickshank, C., Sharma, N., (2006) Make your move: Taking clinical trials to the best location, , http://www.atkearney.com/index.php/Publications/make-your-move.html, Retrieved from; www.baxter.com, Baxter International Inc; Bental, D., Cawsey, A., Jones, R., Patient information systems that tailor to the individual (1999) Patient Education and Counseling, 36, pp. 171-180; Berg, J., Appelbaum, P., Lidz, C., Parker, L., (2001) Informed consent: Legal theory and clinical practice, , New York, NY: Oxford University Press; Blakeslee, A., Addressing audiences in a digital age (2010) Digital literacy for technical communication: 21st century theory and practice, pp. 199-229. , In R.

Method: The issues in this article were examined using a scholarly methodology based on legal research and applied analysis and application to the technical communication field. Results: The findings are that fair use cannot be employed in international intellectual property treaty development because, to operate, it must retain its necessary connection to the U.S. Constitution's goals and policy.

In this article, I will discuss EO 13166; its impact on hospitals, clinics, and limited English proficient (LEP) populations; and how technical communicators involved in translation and localization help medical professionals comply with the law. I will provide best practice strategies for localization practices in the health care industry worldwide. Method: This article employs a literature review of government documentation for Executive Order 13166, as well as hospital and clinic reports of current localization practices designed to increase compliance with EO 13166. Results: The review of current practices indicates that much work remains to be done by technical communicators to help hospitals and clinics comply with EO 13166, especially in the areas of visual icons and other localization efforts. Conclusion: The best strategies for localizing health care information include the following: 1. Make the textual style of the information match that of the culture's expectations. 2. Research the preferences for graphics and color in medical documents for the target culture and use the preferred style in the documentation. 3. Use widely recognized symbols. 4. Use focus groups to test the localization strategy with representatives of the target culture. 5. Consider the content of the documentation when localizing, not just the style and format.","Executive Order 13166; Graphic design; Health; Localization",,,,,,,,"(2006) Office guide to communicating with limited English proficient patients, , American Medical Association (AMA)., Chicago, IL: AMA; Baker, M., (1992) In other words: A coursebook on translation, , New York, NY: Routledge; Barnum, C., Li, H., Chinese and American technical communication: A cross-cultural comparison of differences (2006) Technical Communication, 53, pp. 143-165; Barrett, S., Dyer, C., Westpheling, K., (2008) Language access: Understanding the barriers and challenges in primary care settings, , McLean, VA: Association of Clinicians for the Underserved; Browner, C.H., Press, N., The production of authoritative knowledge in American prenatal care (1997) Childbirth and authoritative knowledge, pp. 113-131. , In R.

QuikScan employs within-document summaries formatted as numbered list items. These numbers correspond to numbers placed in the body of the document where the summarized ideas are discussed in full. QuikScan enables readers to (1) read summaries instead of the detailed content, (2) use the summaries as previews, (3) navigate quickly to the place where a summarized idea is fully discussed in the body of the document, and (4) direct other individuals to locations in the document. QuikScan is nonproprietary; anyone is free to use it and adapt it to their needs. Requirements: QuikScanning requires the skills of a talented editor and takes practice to master. QuikScanners must choose among four kinds of summaries and three numbering systems, depending on the document's heading structure and other factors. Document elements such as graphics require special techniques. The list items that make up QuikScan summaries must be skillfully written, and target numbers must be placed with care. Results: Empirical studies have demonstrated that QuikScan improves comprehension and the ability to navigate quickly through a document. In addition, QuikScan is regarded positively by readers. A pilot study suggests the value of QuikScan for blind readers. Drawbacks and limitations: QuikScan requires extra work, makes documents longer, and increases both visual complexity and the number of short pages. It is not suitable for documents that do not much benefit from summarization or for documents with free-form layouts.","Document format; Layout; QuikScan; Reading comprehension; Summaries",,,,,,,,"Alley, M., (1996) The craft of scientific writing, , New York, NY: Springer; Farkas, D.K., The explicit structure of print and on-screen documents (2005) Technical Communication Quarterly, 14 (1), pp. 9-30; Hartley, J., Current findings from research on structured abstracts (2004) Journal of the Medical Library Association, 92 (3), pp. 368-371. , http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=442180; Lorch, R.F., Lorch, E.P., Effects of organizational signals on text processing strategies (1995) Journal of Educational Psychology, 87 (4), pp. 537-544; Nevid, J.S., Lampmann, J.L., Effects on content acquisition of signaling key concepts in text material (2003) Teaching of Psychology, 30 (3), pp. 227-230; Rouet, J.F., (2006) The skills of document use: From text comprehension to Web-based learning, , Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates; van der Meij, H., van der Meij, J., (2009), Personal communication; Zhou, Q., (2008) QuikScan: Facilitating document use through innovative formatting, , PhD dissertation, University of Washington; Zhou, Q., Farkas, D.K., QuikScan: An innovative approach to support document use in meetings (2006) Proceedings of the 53rd Conference of the Society for Technical Communication, , In; Zhou, Q., Farkas, D.K., Improving reading with QuikScan: Introduction and experimental validation (2007) Proceedings of the IEEE International Professional Communication Conference, , In; Zhou, Q., Farkas, D.K., QuikScan: Facilitating reading and information navigation through innovative document formatting (2009) Proceedings of the IEEE International Professional Communication Conference, , In","Zhou, Q.; Technical communication, Department of English and Philosophy, University of Wisconsin, Stout, United States; email: zhouq@uwstout.edu",,,,,,,,00493155,,,,"English","Tech.

Results: The interviews and analyses reveal how businesses oriented their sites not only to a human audience of prospective clients but also to an audience of search engines. Businesses that reported search engines to be more helpful in directing traffic to their sites had sites that, in comparison with those of their less successful peers, featured longer home page titles and received more inbound links.

Method: The study surveyed an international sample of 240 technical communicators who maintain Web sites to market their services, and then interviewed half of these survey respondents. Results: Aside from drawing in a moderate portion of clientele directly, these Web sites also helped recruit clientele who originated through such traditional marketing communication as referrals and networking. Yet such traditional communication tended not to be as useful in leading people to these sites as newmedia communication, such as search engines and e-mail. Marketing communication's usefulness in leading people to a Web site is associated with that Web site's levels of success in recruiting clientele. Conclusion: A Web site's efficacy may thereby depend in part on the support of other communication, especially communication sharing a similar medium.","Consultants and independent contractors; Genre systems; Marketing; Technical communication companies; Web sites",,,,,,,,"Bazerman, C., Systems of genres and the enactment of social intentions (1994) Genre and the new rhetoric, pp. 79-101. , In A.

Method: After a description of how personalization exactly works, we demonstrate that the technique is very similar to the approach to personalization as applied in ancient rhetoric. Next, we describe how the history of the concept ""the audience,"" and how it has been analyzed and approached, has led to the tactic of electronically tailoring communication to individuals. We propose the User-Centered Design approach as an approach that can help the designer get to know the individual user, thereby increasing the fit between personalized systems and users' needs, wishes, and contexts. Results: We discuss how the User-Centered Design approach needs to be adjusted to cope with the demands personalization places on the approach. Furthermore, we consider the technical communicator's role in this design process. Conclusion: Technical communicators need to devise and lead user studies that inform and evaluate each step of the personalization process. Researchers need to focus their efforts on studies that aid the design of personalized systems, like discerning in which situations personalization is of added value or not, and identifying the factors that influence the acceptance of personalization.","Audience analysis; Personalization; Usability; User modeling; User-Centered Design",,,,,,,,"Baines, P., Fill, C., Page, K., (2008) Marketing, , Oxford: Oxford University Press; Beane, T.P., Ennis, D.M., Market segmentation: A review (1987) European Journal of Marketing, 21 (5), pp. 20-42; Brennan, R., Baines, P., Garneau, P., (2003) Contemporary strategic marketing, , Houndmills, England: Palgrave Macmillan; Bruns, A., (2007) Produsage: Towards a broader framework for user-led content creation, , Paper presented at Creativity & cognition, 13-15 June, Washington, DC; Brusilovsky, P., Methods and techniques of adaptive hypermedia (1996) User Modeling and User-Adapted Interaction, 6 (2-3), pp. 87-129; Brusilovsky, P., Adaptive hypermedia (2001) User Modeling and User-Adapted Interaction, 11 (1-2), pp. 87-110; Brusilovsky, P., Karagiannidis, C., Sampson, D., Benefits of layered evaluation of adaptive applications and services (2001) Proceedings of the empirical evaluation of adaptive systems workshop, , In S.

The study explores the status of knowledge and understanding of U.S. copyright law, levels of chilled speech, and the use of rhetorical invention in such digital writing contexts. Method: Research methods include a digital survey receiving 334 responses from randomly selected students/teachers and discourse-based interviews with seven of these participants. Results: With respect to authorship, Web writers sometimes occupy conflicting positions. Empirical evidence challenges traditional ideas of authorship, i.e., a single author working alone in a garret, producing texts from his or her sole creative genius. The study finds digital writers' speech is not as ""chilled"" as one might expect, and while knowledge of copyright law is important to digital writers, they are fairly confident in the knowledge they have. Copyright law is not the primary concern of digital writers. As it turns out, ethics trumps the law in importance when considering digital composing choices. In the area of copyright knowledge, key misunderstandings appeared among writers. For example: confusion on (1) the difference between copyright and plagiarism, (2) unauthorized use and authorized use, (3) the government exception to copyright, and (4) the fact that U.S. copyright law protects ""creative"" work to a higher extent than it protects ""factual"" work. Conclusion: The study hopes to provide a methodology for further research, and a baseline in the area of knowledge and understanding of copyright law as it intersects with invention, among the professional writing population.","Chilled speech; Copyright; Invention; Mixed-methods; Plagiarism",,,,,,,,"Booth, W.C., (1974) Modern Dogma and The Rhetoric of Assent, , Chicago: University of Chicago Press; Bowrey, K., (2005) Law & Internet Cultures, , Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press; Use your fair use: Strategies toward action (2000) College Composition and Communication, 51 (3), pp. 485-488. , CCCC Caucus on Intellectual Property; Collins, R., (2007) Deference to Authority In Canada and The US.

Wiki-based collaborative content creation enables new communication practices and thereby challenges several assumptions of existing media choice theories. Method: Analysis of empirical evidence from 32 published case descriptions and reports to evaluate wiki technology in a corporate context based on the defining characteristics of three media choice theories (i.e., media richness theory, theory of media synchronicity, and common ground theory). Results: Wikis meet or exceed capabilities of several other communication and collaboration media, and thus provide a credible alternative to other business communication technologies currently in use. Further, distinct media capabilities of wikis are not fully represented by current media choice theories, suggesting the need to extend media choice theories to recognize these unique capabilities. Conclusion: The unique features of enterprise wikis enable new collaboration practices and challenge some of the core theoretical assumptions of media choice theories. The refactoring capability of wikis is identified as a unique feature that enables new forms of collaboration and communication in organizations. An implementation that wishes to successfully leverage wiki-enabled collaboration opportunities must carefully consider challenges of human interaction such as free-riding, or conflict of values.","Business communication; Collaborative writing; Content refactoring; Media capability; Wiki",,,,,,,,"Auer, S., Jungmann, B., Schönefeld, F., Semantic wiki representations for building an enterprise knowledge base (2007) Lecture Notes In Computer Science, 4636, pp. 330-333; Barth, F.J., Vilela, G.T., Timoszczuk, A.P., Mussoi, A.L.G., (2008) Wiki As a Tool For Improving the Innovation Process, , Paper presented at the WikiSym'08, Porto, Portugal; Bean, L., Hott, D.D., Wiki: A speedy new tool to manage projects (2005) Journal of Corporate Accounting & Finance, 16, pp. 3-8; Birnholtz, J.P., Finholt, T.A., Horn, D.B., Bae, S.J., (2005) Grounding Needs: Achieving Common Ground Via Lightweight Chat In Large, Distributed, Ad-hoc Groups, , Paper presented at the Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems, Portland, OR; Black, E.L., Kilzer, R.D., Web 2.0 tools ease renovation service disruptions at the Ohio State University libraries (2008) Public Services Quarterly, 4, pp. 93-110; Blaschke, S., Stein, K., (2008) Methods and Measures For the Analysis of Corporate Wikis: A Case Study, , Paper presented at the Annual Meeting of the International Communication Association, Montreal, Canada; Bock, G., Paxhia, S., Taking stock of today's experiences and tomorrow's opportunities (2008) Collaboration and Social Media, pp. 1-66. , Cambridge, MA: The Gilbane Group; Carlin, D., Corporate wikis go viral (2007) BusinessWeek, , http://www.businessweek.com/technology/content/mar2007/tc20070312_476504.htm, Retrieved December 8, 2009, from; Carlson, J.R., George, J.F., Media appropriateness in the conduct and discovery of deceptive communication: The relative influence of richness and synchronicity (2004) Group Decision and Negotiation, 13, pp. 191-210; Clark, D., Andersen, R., Renegotiating with technology: Training towards more sustainable technical communication (2005) Technical Communication, 52, pp. 289-301; Clark, H.H., Brennan, S.A., (1991) Perspectives On Socially Shared Cognition, , Washington, DC: APA Books; Convertino, G., Ganoe, C.H., Schafer, W.A., Yost, B., Carroll, J.M., (2005) A Multiple View Approach to Support Common Ground In Distributed and Synchronous Geo-collaboration, , Paper presented at the Third International Conference on Coordinated & Multiple Views in Exploratory Visualization, London; Cooney, L., (2006) Wiki As a Knowledge Management Tool, , Sophia Antipolis, France: Ecole de commerce et de management, CERAM; Corb, G., (2008) Johns Hopkins University.

Specifically, this article is an examination of requirements specifications written for a Web-based radiology application serving the medical industry. Method: The study adheres to the usability principle that successful design accommodates complex problem solving. Requirements specifications, the application, and the application's code are examined as part of the study. Results: The first determination is that composing detailed narratives within the requirements specifications can ensure flexible spaces for users, in this case doctors, to view, study, and manipulate data as they see fit. The article also acknowledges and accounts for the reality of low-level or code-level procedural programming required for creating such flexible spaces. The second determination is that employing narratological structures within requirements specifications also leads to technical inventions at the code level. Practitioners will have a better understanding of how their work facilitates the development of a software application's functionality, design, and even code. Conclusion: Ultimately, narrative is the suggested method for developing the flexible affordances desired by usability specialists and it simultaneously helps negotiate low-level code.","Interface design; Narrative; Requirements specifications; Software development; Usability",,,,,,,,"Abbott, H.P., (2002) The Cambridge Introduction to Narrative, , Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press; Albers, M., Introduction (2003) Content and Complexity: Information Design In Technical Communication, pp. 1-13. , In M.

The concept of information is examined from the perspectives of mathematics, engineering, biology, and human behavior. Characteristics of information common to all information systems are brought forward to a key understanding - that information is inextricably linked with behavior. It follows that the first step in designing an information product is to state its purpose in terms of a desired behavioral outcome.

One important reason for this failure is that rhetorical theory dominates the teaching of technical communication in the academy. Though extremely influential in the academy, rhetorical theory is inappropriate for teaching some kinds of important workplace communication (instructions, online documentation, computer-human interfaces, indexes), and it does not address important skills that practicing technical communicators need. Instrumental discourse differs from rhetoric in its purpose, in its absence of reasons and argumentation, in its task-oriented approach, in its emphasis on accessibility, and in its emphasis on economics. As a result, instrumental discourse is much more appropriate for the genres and skills that practicing technical communicators use, and it offers significant advantages to students, and in the long run, to the academy itself.",,,,,,,,,"(1992) Macintosh Human Interface Guidelines, , Reading, MA: Addison-Wesley Publishing Company; Aristotle, (1991) On Rhetoric: A Theory of Civil Discourse, , Translated by George A.

Link authoring, like content authoring, is a creative process of making connections between disparate yet related information. Effective link authoring requires intellect, creativity, and domain knowledge to define the relationships among concepts that can support a particular pedagogical objective. The contribution of hypermedia link authoring is often poorly understood and unrecognized by traditional academic and publishing communities. Publishers of commercial and academic hypermedia typically neither formally recognize link authoring as something that should be protected by copyright, nor do they extend to those involved in link authoring the same degree of credit or remuneration given conventional content authors or illustrators. However, with the recent explosive growth in hypermedia publishing via the World Wide Web, CD-ROM, and other digital forms, the significance of link authoring is becoming more apparent. Clearly, a new paradigm is in order, one that recognizes the contribution of link authoring in the communication of thoughts, emotions, and information.",,,,,,,,,"Bergeron, B.P., Locke, S., Courseware options for the Macintosh (1989) MD Computing, 6 (1), pp. 44-49; Bergeron, B.P., Rouse, R.L., Cognitive aspects of modeling and simulating complex biological systems (1992) Structuring Biological Systems: A Computer Modeling Approach, pp. 125-166. , S.

According to the 455 respondents, manipulating typography and leading to fit more or less information on a page and using persuasive coloring or spacing are ethical practices, while the manipulation of pictorial illustrations and the distortion of graphics are unethical. Opinion on using typography to decrease readability is divided. In five of the seven cases, women are consistently more lenient or men consistently more strict in their evaluations of ethics. Respondents offered nine different types of explanations for their answers: common practices, specifications, reader's responsibility, writer's responsibility, writer's intentions, consequences, judgments, principles, and insufficient information.

Research and experience indicate that online indexing can be most effective if it is approached as a combination of traditional indexing and using computer search capabilities. Typical search facilities have great power but tend to rely on complex algorithms or else retrieve more information than users can effectively sort through. Traditional indexing techniques serve as a filter for concepts to limit searches to information that users will actually find valuable. To take full advantage of search facilities, online indexes can be designed with a flat (nonhierarchical) structure in which each index entry is clearly worded and makes use of keywords from the subject matter. Indexers can include additional keywords as synonyms that point to the relevant index entries. When indexers take advantage of these concepts and when index users clearly understand what to expect from online indexes, then the indexes become an extremely powerful retrieval medium.",,,,,,,,,"Billick, D., Book and database indexing: A comparison (1992) American Society of Indexers Newsletter, MARCH-APRIL, pp. 19-20; Curtis, D., Bernhardt, S.A., Keywords, titles, abstracts, and online searches: Implications for technical writing (1991) The Technical Writing Teacher, 18 (2), pp. 142-161; Lungu, D., Nonnecke, B., Carey, T., Mitterer, J., Will indexes survive?
