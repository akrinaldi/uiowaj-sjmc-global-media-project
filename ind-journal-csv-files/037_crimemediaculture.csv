We develop an imaginative political framework to circumvent the relational tensions currently ensnaring public criminology discourse. Employing the psychoanalytic theory of Slavoj Žižek, we engage the public criminology literature and its agential-activist notion of political engagement to reveal three primary directives dismissive of alternative praxes of resistance: faith in the State and public, hypocrisy eschewal, and legitimacy. By invoking the distinction between these modes of political engagement through the “fictional social realities” depicted in Ken Kesey’s One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest, we provide insights into how public criminologists can overcome concerns occluding other modes of “going public.” With such a move, we believe that public criminology’s capacity to “translate crime scholarship out of the academy” will evolve and become open to the possibility that “doing nothing” is more effective than may first appear. © The Author(s) 2019.",Bartleby politics; imaginative criminology; Ken Kesey; public criminology; relationality,,,,,,,,,"Abbott, E., (1885) Flatland: Romance of Many Dimension, , Boston, MA, Robert Brothers; Althusser, L., (1968) Reading Capital, , London, New Left Books; Araiza, J.A., Sturm, H.A., Istek, P., Hands up, don’t shoot, whose side are you on?

In the first game, the player-as-Batman is situated in Arkham Asylum, a high-security facility for the criminally insane and supervillains that also temporarily houses a general population of prisoners from Blackgate Penitentiary. The elision of criminality and mental illness becomes amplified in the second game with the establishment of Arkham City, a combined facility that conflates asylum and prison, completely dissolving any distinction between crime and madness. We draw on Rafter’s conceptual framework of popular criminology to seriously interrogate the representation of violence, crime and madness in these games. More than simply texts offering popular explanations for crime, the games directly implicate the player in violence enacted upon the bodies of criminals and patients alike. Violence is necessary to move the action of the game forward and evokes a range of emotional responses from players who draw from personal experience and other cultural and media representations as they navigate the game. We argue that while the game celebrates violence and the brutal conditions of incarceration, it also offers possibilities for subversive and critical readings. While working to affirm assumptions about crime and mental illness, the game also provides a visceral and visual critique of excessive punishment by the state as a source of injustice for those deemed mad or bad. © The Author(s) 2019.",Batman; incarceration; justice; mental illness; participatory media; popular criminology; vigilantism,,,,,,,,,"Adkinson, C.D., The Amazing Spider-Man and the evolution of the comics code: a case study in cultural criminology (2008) Journal of Criminal Justice and Popular Culture, 15 (3), pp. 241-261; Atkinson, R., Rodgers, T., Pleasure zones and murder boxes: online pornography and violent video games as cultural zones of exception (2016) The British Journal of Criminology, 56 (6), pp. 1291-1307; Bauman, Z., (2004) Wasted Lives: Modernity and its Outcasts, , Cambridge, Polity Press; Crick, T., The game body: toward a phenomenology of contemporary video gaming (2011) Games and Culture, 6 (3), pp. 259-269; Dini, P., (2009) Batman: Arkham Asylum, , London, Rocksteady Studios, (Directed by; Dini, P., (2011) Batman: Arkham City, , London, Rocksteady Studios, (Directed by; Dini, P., D’Anda, C., (2011) Arkham City, , New York, DC Comics; Egenfeldt-Nielsen, S., Smith, J.H., Tosca, S.P., Narrative (2008) Understanding Video Games: The Essential Introduction, pp. 169-204. , Egenfeldt-Nielsen S., Smith J.H., Tosca S.P., (eds), New York, Routledge, In:, (eds; Ferrell, J., Hayward, K., Young, J., (2008) Cultural Criminology: An Invitation, , Los Angeles, CA, SAGE; Foucault, M., (1977) Discipline and Punish, , Sheridan A., (ed), New York, Random House, (trans; Frome, J., Eight ways videogames generate emotion.

This perpetuates stereotypical media representations and public perceptions of prison laborers as nothing more than their indentured subjugation. This photo essay presents a more nuanced view of the experience of prison labor. I present images of an exceptional labor program, Arizona’s Inmate Wildfire Program, in order to question what happens when prison labor becomes visible, and when the symbolic markers of incarceration disappear. The program, in which 11 prison crews fight wildfires across the state, is an experiential paradox for its participants. It is at once exploitative, with its low pay for risky work, as well as transformative, with its potential for a re-emergence of complex identities and reclamation of dignity for those involved. Through these images, I argue that the transformative potential of the program is due in part to the program’s visibility, as incarcerated firefighters interact with the public—and their own self-representations—in emergent, meaningful ways. I call to examine the complexities of programs that challenge certain dehumanizing experiences of incarceration while being securely entrenched within the carceral regime. © The Author(s) 2019.",Cultural criminology; identity; identity; prison labor; public perception,,,,,,,,,"Aubrey, A., Whole Foods says it will stop selling foods made with prison labor (2015) National Public Radio, , https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2015/09/30/444797169/whole-foods-says-it-will-stop-selling-foods-made-by-prisoners, 30, September; Bail, K., Foster, J., Dalmida, S.G., The impact of invisibility on the health of migrant farmworkers in the southeastern United States: a case study from Georgia (2012) Nursing Research and Practice, 2012, p. 760418; Benson, L., The invisible worker (2001) The North Carolina Journal of International Law and Commercial Regulation, 27, pp. 483-496; Casper, M.J., Moore, L.J., (2009) Missing Bodies: The Politics of Visibility, , New York, NYU Press; Crain, M., Poster, W.R., Cherry, M.A., (2016) Invisible Labor: Hidden Work in the Contemporary World, , Oakland, CA, University of California Press; De Viggiani, N., Unhealthy prisons: exploring structural determinants of prison health (2007) Sociology of Health & Illness, 29 (1), pp. 115-135; Desmond, M., The lie of heroism (2008) Contexts, 7, pp. 56-58; Gibson-Light, M., (2019) The prison as market: how penal labor systems reproduce inequality, , University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ, PhD Dissertation; Goodman, P., (2010) Hero or inmate, camp or prison, rehabilitation or labor extraction: a multi-level study of California’s prison fire camps, , University of California, Irvine, Irvine, CA, PhD Dissertation; Goodman, P., Hero and inmate: work, prisons, and punishment in California’s fire camps (2012) Working USA: The Journal of Labor and Society, 15, pp. 353-376; Haraway, D., (1997) Modest_Witness@Second_Millenium.FemaleMan©_Meets_OncomouseTM, , New York, Routledge; Jones, R., Schmid, T., (2000) Doing Time: Prison Experience and Identity among First-Time Inmates, , Stanford, CT, Jai Press; Jose-Kampfner, C., Coming to terms with existential death: an analysis of women’s adaptation to life in prison (1990) Social Justice, 17 (2), pp. 110-125; King, R., Mauer, M., Huling, T., (2003) Big Prisons, Small Towns: Prison Economics in Rural America, , https://www.sentencingproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Big-Prisons-Small-Towns-Prison-Economics-in-Rural-America.pdf, The Sentencing Project; Lipsey, M., Cullen, F., The effectiveness of correctional rehabilitation: a review of systematic reviews (2007) Annual Review of Law and Social Science, 3, pp. 297-320; Lynch, M., (2010) Sunbelt Justice: Arizona and the Transformation of American Punishment, , Stanford, Stanford University Press; McDowell, L., Batnitzky, A., Dyer, S., Division, segmentation, and interpellation: the embodied labors of migrant workers in a greater London hotel (2007) Economic Geography, 83 (1), pp. 1-25; Meijers, J., Harte, J., Jonker, F., Prison brain?

It explores the case on a number of levels. First, it situates violence, and these murders specifically, in the localised spaces of advanced marginality, which follow in the wake of deindustrialisation and economic decline. Second, the article links these murders to sex workers’ disproportionate vulnerability to violence as a result of social stigma and situational risk. However, informed by auto-ethnography and the growing recognition that there is potential for academic analysis within criminology to include the criminologist’s own emotional engagement, the discussion moves on to explore the author’s personal reflection on this series of murders derived from vicarious connection and proximity to victims. In addition, the author draws on the concepts of spectrality and haunting, which have gained currency across the social sciences, to illuminate the irrevocable connections between place, violence and emotion at the level of the local. The concept of spectrality offers a means of envisaging how the past continues to occupy and disrupt the present. Studies of place deploy spectrality and the figure of the ghost to consider how acts of violence and atrocity transform the essence of physical and social space. For the purposes of this article, the concept of haunting is used to explore these young women’s lives and deaths, which retain a strong presence in the collective memory due to their powerful connections to place, as well as the cultural work of the media in keeping them alive in the local imagination. Finally, the political potential of haunting – as a means to confront past and ongoing injustices, is also considered, which draws attention to the combined structural conditions in which these young women were murdered. © The Author(s) 2019.",Emotion; local news; marginality; place; sex workers; spectrality; violence,,,,,,,,,"Abbott, P., Wallace, C., (1997) An Introduction to Sociology: Feminist Perspectives, , London, Routledge; Allen, E., Body of teenage prostitute missing for a decade is found on farmland as her family make an emotional plea to find the killer (2012) Mail Online, , https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2174379/Rachel-Wilson-death-Body-teenage-sex-worker-missing-decade-farmland.html“ssing-decade-farmland.html”ex-worker-missing-decade-farmland.html, 16, July; Apel, D., (2015) Beautiful Terrible Ruins: Detroit and the Anxiety of Decline, , New York, Rutgers University Press; Baddeley, A.D., (1999) Essentials of Human Memory, , Hove, Psychology Press; Barley, S., Donna Keogh: cleveland police apologise to parents as fresh review into disappearance is launched (2015) Teesside Live, , https://www.gazettelive.co.uk/news/teesside-news/donna-keogh-cleveland-police-apologise-9053258, accessed 17 June 2019, 16 April; Bell, M., The ghosts of place (1997) Theory and Society, 26, pp. 813-836; Boltanski, L., (1999) Distant Suffering: Morality, Media and Politics, , Cambridge, Cambridge University Press; Brookman, F., (2005) Understanding Homicide, , London, SAGE; Byrne, D., (1999) Social Exclusion, , Milton Keynes, UK, Open University Press; Cameron, J.J., (2018) Reconsidering Radical Feminism: Affect and the Politics of Heterosexuality, , Washington, DC, University of Washington Press; Caputi, J., (1987) The Age of the Sex Crime, , Bowling Green, OH, Bowling Green State University Popular Press; Carrabine, E., Seeing things: Violence, voyeurism and the camera (2014) Theoretical Criminology, 18 (2), pp. 134-158; Clark, C., Emotions and micropolitics in everyday life (1990) Research Agendas in the Sociology of Emotions, pp. 305-333. , Kemper T.D., (ed), Albany, NY, State University of New York Press, In:, (ed; Clarke Dillman, J., (2014) Women and Death in Film, Television and News: Dead but Not Gone, , Basingstoke, Palgrave Macmillan; Corrigan, N., What has caused the drop in vice?

The development of this early copycat crime meme is traceable to the nature of the crime, “ghost riding the whip,” and the social media and popular music communication channels associated with it. Ghost riding the whip involved traffic violations where drivers exit their cars and dance atop or alongside the moving driverless vehicles. Social media allowed the widespread diffusion of detailed instructions that spread this crime from a single minority community to the middle class within a 3-month period. The study of this copycat crime meme examined four types of data: Google Trends, rap songs, ProQuest news media data, and YouTube videos. The examination of the crime wave suggests how Gabriel Tarde’s 19th-century ideas operate in the contemporary social media era. However, unlike pre-social media-based crime waves that were launched via interpersonal and legacy media communication pathways, for ghost riding, rap songs, YouTube postings, and Google searches spurred its growth. Legacy media were found to be most important during the crime wave’s decline, but not during its diffusion. For this copycat crime meme, social media’s influence flowed in a unique upward and outward pattern and the results raise the research questions as to how social media have changed the dynamics of crime waves and how important legacy media will be in future crime waves. © The Author(s) 2019.",Copycat crime; crime diffusion; crime waves; ghost riding; Google; memes; social media; YouTube,,,,,,,,,"Abrutyn, S., Mueller, A.S., Reconsidering Durkheim’s assessment of Tarde: formalizing a Tardian theory of imitation, contagion, and suicide suggestion (2014) Sociological Forum, 29 (3), pp. 698-719; Backe, E., Lilleston, L., Mccleary-Sills, J., Networked individuals, gendered violence: a literature review of cyberviolence (2018) Violence and Gender, 5 (3), pp. 135-146; Bandura, A., (1973) Aggression: A Social Learning Analysis, , Englewood Cliffs, NJ, Prentice Hall; Bandura, A., Ross, D., Ross, S., Imitation of film-mediated aggressive models (1963) The Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology, 66 (1), pp. 3-11; Best, J., (1999) Random Violence: How We Talk about New Crimes and New Victims, , Berkeley, CA, University of California Press; Best, J., The diffusion of social problems (2001) How Claims Spread: Cross-National Diffusion of Social Problems, pp. 1-18. , Best J., (ed), New York, Aldine de Gruyter, In:, (ed; Bjarneskans, H., Grønnevik, B., Sandberg, A., (1999) The lifecycle of memes, , https://www.aleph.se/Trans/Cultural/Memetics/memecycle.html, accessed 2 February 2019; Blackmore, S., (1999) The Meme Machine, , Oxford, Oxford University Press; Blank, G., Who creates content?

Considerations of place and the notion of rurality are therefore crucial to understanding how these media representations are constructed and their power to influence national understandings of rural people, places and policy debates. In order to explore these complexities, we apply Simon Cottle’s ‘communicative architecture of television’ methodology to an analysis of three long-form reportage television programmes on the theme of ice use in small Australian towns. Theories of ‘social imaginaries’ inform the argument that a distinctive Australian ‘agrarian imaginary’ can be discerned through the reporting’s strong associations with the connections and contradictions attached to ideas and emotions about ‘the bush’. The television programmes draw on what Cottle terms ‘mythic’ and ‘collective’ frames that reach into the cultural reservoirs of communities to reinforce national perceptions, values and narratives about how rural communities ought to be, and by extension, how they ought to deal with complex social problems, such as illicit drug distribution and use. © The Author(s) 2019.",Agrarian imaginary; Australian news media; crystal methamphetamine; rural drug crime; rural ice use; television crime news,,,,,,"Academy of the Social Sciences in Australia, ASSA","An earlier version of this article was presented at the Rural Crime Workshop, 7-8 February 2019 convened by Dr Alistair Harkness of Federation University, Victoria, and funded by the Academy of Social Sciences Australia.

While there is a notion that particular individuals ‘commit’ to a life of crime, criminology is yet to properly articulate why this is and how it comes to be. Drawing on psychoanalytically inflected discourse theory, this article demonstrates that the clinical categories of psychoanalysis such as subject, lack, identification and jouissance (enjoyment) are useful in understanding persistence and career criminality. The imagined possibility of inhabiting a ‘fantasmatic’ lifestyle becomes unconsciously reinforced by the joyful sensations that accompany aspects of their criminal lifestyle: criminal cultural consumerism, peer group respect and appearing attractive to women. Without being conscious and rationalistic, these processes nevertheless inform self-perception and behaviour at a deep level of being. This article provides a novel explanation for why persistent criminals remain dedicated to their illicit lifestyles. © The Author(s) 2019.",Career criminality; crime; enjoyment; identification; persistence,,,,,,,,,"Akers, R., (2009) Social Learning and Social Structure: A General Theory of Crime and Deviance, , New Brunswick, NJ; London, Transaction; Atılgan, E., ‘How could I become a policeman if no officer or policeman ever comes out of Çinçin?’ Stigmatised Places (2013) Kenarın Kitabı: ‘Ara’da Kalmak, Çeperde Yaşamak, pp. 61-88. , Şenol-Cantek F., (ed), Istanbul, Iletişim, [, ].

The Canadian Centre for Child Protection (C3P),1 a non-profit charity located in Winnipeg, Canada, is used as a case study of claims-making and the social construction of the social problem of child sexual exploitation online. The present study focuses on media engagement by C3P and its subsidiary CyberTip—Canada’s national internet tip line—between 2000 and 2011, just prior to CyberTip receiving legislative designation as Canada’s official reporting agency. The analysis draws on news media accounts of claims-making activities of C3P in three local and national Canadian newspapers. By focusing on the rhetoric of claims forwarded by the organization, I argue that C3P has been successful in gaining symbolic ownership of the issue and has been instrumental in defining the nature, extent, and appropriate responses to the problem of online child sexual exploitation in Canada. I conclude by considering the broader implications for criminal justice policy and practice. © The Author(s) 2019.",Child sexual exploitation; claims-making; internet; news media; sex crime; social media,,,,,,,,,"Best, J., (1990) Threatened Children: Rhetoric and Concern about Child-Victims, , Chicago, IL, University of Chicago Press; Best, J., Rhetoric in claims-making: Constructing the missing children problem (1987) Social Problems, 34 (2), pp. 101-121; Campbell, E., Policing paedophilia: Assembling bodies, spaces and things (2016) Crime Media Culture, 12 (3), pp. 345-365; (2017) Statement: New Statistics Canada report reflects alarming reality of sexual abuse of children, , https://protectchildren.ca/en/press-and-media/news-releases/2017/statcan_report_child_sexual_abuse, 26, July, accessed 16 January 2019; https://protectchildren.ca/app/en/thirty, accessed 10 April 2018, (.)

In this article, we show how programs that present themselves as critical of legal authorities can nonetheless reinforce the “law and order punitivism” that underlay the ratcheting up of harsh punishment in the late 20th century. In a case study of the popular documentary miniseries Making a Murderer, we show how this can happen when texts fetishize the question of a criminal defendant’s innocence, adopt a “good versus evil” approach to players in the criminal justice system, and perpetuate a procedural rather than substantive vision of justice. Arguments are supported by a close reading of Making a Murderer and illustrated by a line of discussion it inspired in an internet forum. © The Author(s) 2019.",Crimesploitation; cultural criminology; due process; innocence; legal liberalism; popular culture; punishment; visual criminology,,,,,,,,,"Blythe, A., Making a Murderer’s Laura Ricciardi and Moira Demos: ‘We certainly didn’t leave out anything of real significance (2016) Deadline, , https://deadline.com/2016/08/making-a-murderer-laura-ricciardi-moira-demos-interview-1201805187/, accessed 7 March 2019; Brooks, P., (1976) The Melodramatic Imagination: Balzac, Henry James, and the Mode of Excess, , New Haven, CT, Yale University Press; Brown, M., (2009) The Culture of Punishment: Prison, Society, and Spectacle, , New York, New York University Press; Browne, D., ‘Making a Murderer’: The story behind Netflix’s hit true-crime show (2016) Rolling Stone, , https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/making-a-murderer-the-story-behind-netflixs-hit-true-crime-show-62028/, accessed 7 March 2019; Carrabine, E., Seeing things: Violence, voyeurism and the camera (2014) Theoretical, 18 (2), pp. 134-158. , Criminology; Cavender, G., Fishman, M., Introduction (1998) Entertaining Crime: Television Reality Programs, pp. 1-15. , Fishman M., Cavender G., (eds), New York, Aldine De Gruyter, In:, (eds; Cole, S.A., Aronson, J.D., Blinded by science on the road to abolition?

Images of so-called ‘spice zombies’, rough sleepers in public spaces experiencing severe substance-induced fits, have been used by local and national media to suggest the growing scale of the problem. This article proposes that such depictions should be read through a cultural analysis rooted in the political economy of austerity policies, where the twofold stigma of substance and welfare dependencies directs guilt at the poor, concealing the systemic cruelty of benefits reforms.

I present a Foucauldian problematization of this rationale – arguing that, through a process of over-writing gender, inversion of the norm masks a ‘reversion to the norm’. To interpret this as pro-feminist, one must be distracted by corporeal gender in the superficial role reversal, and blind to the anti-feminist effects in operation. Critical discourse analysis of an example drawn from the popular US television show American Horror Story illustrates that such depictions operate in discursive space as the locus for a process of ‘governmentalized recursion’. A close reading of the media text and its audience reception is performed, methodological considerations in the intersection of feminist analyses and cultural criminology vis a vis gendered lacunae and popular misinterpretation are discussed and the primacy of scenographic analysis is challenged via a focus on ‘the arc’. This article thus contributes an intervention in the discourse predicated on a Foucauldian triangulation of media texts, audience responses and institutional frameworks and practices, to comprise a history of the present in a controversial and neglected area. © The Author(s) 2019.",American Horror Story; critical discourse analysis; cultural criminology; female sexual offenders; feminism; Foucault; governmentality; male rape; narrative arc; reversion,,,,,,,,,"[TV] Season 2: (2013) Asylum, , Dir.

In order to rethink the text in relation to contemporary scholarship on visual criminology, it will explore the visual elements of Discipline and Punish in more detail via the concepts of the ‘tableau’ and the ‘diagram’ found in Gilles Deleuze’s Foucault. These concepts will be supplemented by the notion of the ‘calligram’, drawing on Foucault’s 1968 essay ‘Ceci n’est pas une pipe’ in order to explore what is at stake in current representations of incarceration via a specific engagement with offender art. Evoking Jacques Rancière’s notion of curiosity as a critique of the ‘intolerable image’, the article will suggest ways in which the relationship between the academic scholar qua ‘penal spectator’ and the ‘represented’ incarcerated subject can be reconfigured to produce a more critical, empathetic and socially responsible engagement with such representations. © The Author(s) 2019.",Deleuze; Foucault; incarceration; intolerable; Koestler; offender art; Rancière,,,,,,"Nottingham Trent University, NTU

While consumers of ‘spyware’ have often been government and law enforcement (Citizen Lab, 2015), there is an increasing attempt to market, sell, and commodify ‘spyware’ for use by wider audiences. ‘Spyware’ is sold as a security product commonly aimed at businesses, parents, and intimate partners. Pursuant to calls for a “sociology of security consumption” (Goold et al., 2010: 3), this article analyzes how nine prominent spyware vendors attribute meaning to their products. Spyware vendors face particularly fraught marketing challenges as the general deployment of spyware: a) is often utilized in forms of intimate partner abuse; b) is “morally troubling” from the perspective of being corrosive to many forms of social relations (Loader et al., 2014: 469); and c) has limited contexts where it could be deployed without violating surveillance laws. More specifically, this article compares the social meaning that vendors attempt to give to spyware and contrasts this with the powers of surveillance provided by the product, the marketing messages that appear to support non-consensual use, and the lack of guidance for non-consenting spyware targets to have recourse with the vendors. © The Author(s) 2019.",Family violence; privacy; private security; spyware; surveillance,,,,,,,"We are grateful for constructive feedback provided by Christopher Parsons, Lex Gill, Cynthia Khoo, and Miles Kenyon.

Ethno-political symbols, such as flags and murals, not only point to certain identities but also mark their territory. Whereas those emblems have been the subject of extensive research, political posters remain an overlooked source of rich iconography. This article fills that void by examining a collection of posters on display at the Irish Republican History Museum in West Belfast. The posters, in their original incarnation, emboldened the streetscapes of urban zones during “the Troubles”—a euphemism used to depict sectarian violence from the 1960s to the 1990s. In their afterlife, those posters have been preserved as material artefacts consumed by political tourists interested in gaining insight into the dissonance of heritage. Semiotics—the study of signs—provides a theoretical paradigm for this interpretation of the posters and their meaning. Moreover, Juri Lotman’s notion of the semiosphere (semiotic space) adds a deeper layer of analysis by directing critical attention to the role of the boundary where the performance of signs is most intense. © The Author(s) 2019.",Northern Ireland; political imprisonment; political tourism; semiosphere; semiotics,,,,,,,"This project benefits from the Rutgers sabbatical program.

After a general review of the phenomenon (including brief explanations of important cognate fields such as ‘machine learning’, ‘deep learning’, and ‘reinforcement learning’), the paper then turns to the potential application of AI by criminals, including what we term here ‘crimes with AI’, ‘crimes against AI’, and ‘crimes by AI’. In these sections, our aim is to highlight AI’s potential as a criminogenic phenomenon, both in terms of scaling up existing crimes and facilitating new digital transgressions. In the third part of the article, we turn our attention to the main ways the AI paradigm is transforming policing, surveillance, and criminal justice practices via diffuse monitoring modalities based on prediction and prevention. Throughout the paper, we deploy an array of programmatic examples which, collectively, we hope will serve as a useful AI primer for criminologists interested in the ‘tech-crime nexus’. © The Author(s) 2020.",Artificial Intelligence; Big Data criminology; cybercrime; digital criminology; inescapable surveillance; machine learning; technology and crime,,,,,,,,,"Ackerman, E., Qbo robot passes mirror test (2011) IEEE Spectrum: Technology, Engineering, and Science News, , https://spectrum.ieee.org/automaton/robotics/artificial-intelligence/qbo-passes-mirror-test-is-therefore-selfaware, 6, December; Ahmed, S., The messy truth about social credit (2019) Logic Magazine, , https://logicmag.io/china/the-messy-truth-about-social-credit/, 1, May; Ajder, H., Patrini, G., Cavalli, F., The state of DeepFakes: landscape, threats, and impact (2019) Deeptrace Labs, , https://regmedia.co.uk/2019/10/08/deepfake_report.pdf, September; Aldridge, J., Does online anonymity boost illegal market trading?

This article draws on original, empirical research to conceptualise the phenomenon of the ‘social media test’ – the evolution of social media into a legitimate measure of police performance. Through in-depth interviews with police and non-police respondents the article maps the genealogy of, and provides perspective on, one of the first viral cases of bystander video of police excessive force in Australia filmed and uploaded to YouTube. The study shows the video’s impact on hegemonic mainstream and police news media narratives, processes of criminalisation and police accountability and the merit of narrative criminology in unpacking these phenomena. Police alluding to the ‘social media test’ in in-depth interviews shows that digital media in general and social media in particular can no longer be dismissed as peripheral or subsidiary to public discourse on policing in a digital society. © The Author(s) 2020.",Accountability; bystander video; latent sousveillance; narrative criminology; police excessive force; social media,,,,,,,,,"Unreported, Local Court NSW, , Wynhausen, E; (, ) Unreported; Unreported, Local Court NSW, , Barko, M; (2014) Jamie Jackson Reed ‘brutalised’ by constable at Sydney Mardi Gras, court finds, , http://www.abc.net.au/news/2014-02-06/teenager-brutalised-by-constable-at-mardi-gras/5243212, accessed 6 August 2016; Agnew-Pauley, W.E., Hughes, C.E., Trends and offending circumstances in the police use of drug detection dogs in New South Wales 2008–2018 (2019) Current Issues in Criminal Justice, 31 (1), pp. 4-23; Anderson, J.L., Heath, M., (2016) Criminal Law Guidebook: New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia, , Melbourne, VIC, Australia, Oxford University Press; Beetham, D., (2013) The Legitimation of Power, , Basingstoke, Palgrave Macmillan, 1991, (, [, ]; Bittner, E., (1970) Functions of the Police in Modern Society: A Review of Background Factors, Current Practices, and Possible Role Models, , Chevy Chase, MD, National Institute of Mental Health; Bock, M.A., Film the police!

Their attacks, moreover, seem to have been precipitated not by the direct instructions of a formal hierarchy but by the encouragement of propaganda produced and disseminated by networked, media-savvy terrorist groups. It is necessary to explain how these “recruitment” efforts work. Cultural criminology, with its understanding of the relationship between mediated meaning and individual experience, can provide such an analysis. The article presents a qualitative document analysis of 32 propaganda magazines produced by the Islamic State and Al-Qaeda. It demonstrates that they contain significantly more than religious rhetoric and military strategy. Rather, they are part of a process that crystalizes a jihadi subculture that appeals to disaffected and/or marginalized, excitement-seeking youths. The magazines cultivate violence by constructing a militarized style that celebrates outlaw status, where violence is eroticized and aestheticized. They idealize the notion of a jihadi terrorist that is tough and willing to commit brutal violence. The lifestyle portrayed offers the possibility of heroism, excitement, belonging and imminent fame, themes often espoused by conventional, Western consumer culture. The magazines occasionally draw on street jargon, urban music, fashion, films, and video games. The subcultural model of jihadi propaganda we explicate provides a novel way of understanding terrorist recruiting tactics and motivations that are not necessarily in opposition to contemporary conventional criminal and “mainstream” cultures, but in resonance with them. © The Author(s) 2020.",Cultural criminology; jihadi terrorism; qualitative media analysis; subculture; terrorist propaganda,,,,,,Norges ForskningsrÃ¥d: 259541,"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was partly supported by the Norwegian Research Council (research grant 259541)",,"Al-Rawi, A., Video games, terrorism, and ISIS’s Jihad 3.0 (2018) Terrorism and Political Violence, 30 (4), pp. 740-760; Andersen, J.C., Sandberg, S., Islamic state propaganda: between social movement framing and subcultural provocation (2018) Terrorism and Political Violence, , Epub ahead of print 27 July; Bakker, E., de Bont, R., Belgian and Dutch foreign fighters (2012–2015): characteristics, motivations, and roles in the war in Syria and Iraq (2016) Small Wars & Insurgencies, 27 (5), pp. 837-857; Basra, R., Neumann, P.R., Brunner, C., (2016) Criminal Pasts, Terrorist Futures: European Jihadists and the New Crime-Terror Nexus, , London, The International Centre for the Study of Radicalisation and Political Violence; Basra, R., Neumann, P.R., Criminal pasts, terrorist futures: European jihadists and the new crime-terror nexus (2016) Perspectives on Terrorism, 10 (6), pp. 25-40; Bennett, A., Kahn-Harris, H., (2004) After Subculture: Critical Studies in Contemporary Youth Culture, , London, Palgrave Macmillan, (eds; Borum, R., Radicalization into Violent Extremism I: a review of social science theories (2011) Journal of Strategic Security, 4 (4), pp. 7-36. , (, a; Borum, R., Radicalization into violent extremism II: a review of social science theories (2011) Journal of Strategic Security, 4 (4), pp. 37-62. , (, b; Bowen, G.A., Document analysis as a qualitative research method (2009) Qualitative Research Journal, 9 (2), pp. 27-40; Christien, A., The representation of youth in the Islamic State’s propaganda magazine Dabiq (2016) Journal of Terrorism Research, 7 (3), pp. 1-8; Cohen, A.K., (1955) Delinquent Boys: The Culture of the Gang, , Chicago, Free Press; Colvin, S., Pisoiu, D., When being bad is good?

Certain spaces that determine or are determined by the actions of drug trafficking organizations are described, analyzed, and classified based on various methodologies and the use of academic, official, and press information. In addition, case studies are reconstructed using architectural and geographic representation mechanisms to exemplify and illustrate the main arguments. The paper examines the three stages of activity that constitute the illegal drug economy: production (involving the placement of crop fields and laboratories), distribution (which entails exploitation of mobility infrastructure), and cross-cutting activities in relation to drug trafficking support spaces. The research provides an articulated interpretation of the various drug trafficking activities from a spatial perspective, the characterization of spaces that are important to criminal organizations and to the performance of their activities, and insights into the spatial thinking strategies and tactics associated with drug trafficking. © The Author(s) 2020.",Architecture; cocaine; Colombia; drugs; heroin; Mexico; spatial thinking; territory; trafficking,,,,,,"Universidad de los Andes, Uniandes","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was supported by the Center for Studies on Security and Drugs (CESED) of the Universidad de los Andes.",,"Aguilar, H., Guerrero, E., Madrazo, A., (2012) Más allá de la Guerra de las Drogas, , México, Cal y Arena; Allen, C.M., (2005) An Industrial Geography of Cocaine, , New York, Routledge; Anderson, B., (2015) La caza de los narcosubmarinos, , https://motherboard.vice.com/es/article/4xng3n/la-caza-de-los-narcosubmarinos-, accessed 12 December 2018; Anselin, L., Rey, S.J., (2009) Perspectives on Spatial Data Analysis, , Berlin, Springer-Verlag; Ansolabehere, K., (2017) Te seguiré buscando.

Research looking at heterosexual instances of sexual violence has given us valuable insights into how (hetero)normative gender roles are constructed in news media, and how these work to excuse and minimise the actions of heterosexual men. But how does this change when at least one of the men involved is queer or homosexual and does not fit into the (hetero)normative gender role paradigm which is commonly used to excuse men’s sexually violent behaviours? This research examined three celebrity cases of alleged sexual violence from the #MeToo movement where the communication of sexual consent (or lack thereof) played a primary role in media reporting. This includes the heteronormative case of Aziz Ansari, and two cases involving homosexual men including Kevin Spacey and Tom Ballard. Our research found that with an absence of cultural intelligibility around queer sex and queer negotiations of consent, problematic and damaging stereotypes about homosexual ‘deviancy’ were instead used by news media in attempts to make sense of these cases. It ultimately found that in both the heterosexual and homosexual cases that news media reporting was overwhelmingly protecting and perpetuating norms of hegemonic masculinity, namely through legitimising any homosexual advance on a heterosexual man as violence, and any heterosexual male advance on a woman as non-violence. © The Author(s) 2020.",#MeToo; consent; homophobia; masculinities; sexual violence,,,,,,,,,"Abdullah-Khan, N., Challenging myths?

This part-privatisation of probation services has raised important questions about the legitimacy of the new organisations in the eyes of both internal and external audiences, and about the ‘legitimation work’ that the CRCs might engage in to address any legitimacy deficits they themselves perceive. This article presents the findings of an analysis of the websites of all 21 CRCs, and considers what these externally facing representations of the CRCs suggest about legitimation work in the private probation sector. Our analysis suggests that CRCs use some of the same strategies of legitimation that have been found in another ‘tainted trade’ – the private security industry – and are similarly ambivalent about what – and to whom – they are marketing their ‘business’. We suggest that our analysis sheds new light on old questions about how the somewhat intangible goods of probation work can be captured and communicated to a mixed constituency of potential stakeholders, as well as raising new questions about the role of websites (and other marketing materials) in that endeavour. © The Author(s) 2020.",Legitimation; privatisation; probation; Transforming Rehabilitation; website analysis,,,,,,,,,"Aebi, M.F., Delgrande, N., Marguet, Y., Have community sanctions and measures widened the net of European criminal justice systems?

Undertaking the case study of the popular animated children’s series PAW Patrol, I find that crime is committed predominantly by literal outsiders and that wrongdoers are temporarily warehoused or forced to engage in hard labor. In this world, politicians are presented as incompetent or unethical and the state, either incapable of delivering or unwilling to provide basic social services to citizens, relies on the PAW Patrol corporation to investigate crime, rescue non-human animals in states of distress, and recycle. I argue that the series suggests to audiences that we can and should rely on corporations and technological advancements to combat crime and conserve, with responsibilized individuals assisting in this endeavor. Ultimately, PAW Patrol echoes core tenets of neoliberalism and encourages complicity in a global capitalist system that (re)produces inequalities and causes environmental harms. © The Author(s) 2020.",Children’s television; conservation; drones; green cultural criminology; neoliberalism; PAW Patrol; xenophobia,,,,,,,,,"Aldridge, J., Cross, S., Young people today: news media, policy and youth justice (2008) Journal of Children and Media, 2 (3), pp. 203-216; Arcimaviciene, L., Baglana, S.H., Migration, metaphor and myth in media representations: the ideological dichotomy of “them” and “us (2018) SAGE, 8, pp. 1-13; Boda, Z., Szabó, G., The media and attitudes towards crime and the justice system: a qualitative system (2011) European Journal of Criminology, 8 (4), pp. 329-342; Bracken-Roche, C., Domestic drones: the politics of verticality and the surveillance industrial complex (2016) Geographica Helvetica, 71 (3), pp. 167-172; Brisman, A., Not a bedtime story: climate change, neoliberalism and the future of the Arctic (2013) Michigan State International Law Review, 22 (1), pp. 241-289; Brisman, A., (2016) Geometries of Crime: How Young People Perceive Crime and Justice, , London, Palgrave Macmillan, (, a; Brisman, A., On narrative and green cultural criminology (2016) International Journal for Crime, Justice and Social Democracy, 6 (2), pp. 64-77. , (, b; Brisman, A., The fable of The Three Little Pigs: climate change and green cultural criminology (2019) International Journal for Crime, Justice and Social Democracy, 8 (1), pp. 46-69; Brisman, A., South, N., A green-cultural criminology: an exploratory outline (2012) Crime, Media, Culture, 9 (2), pp. 115-135; Brisman, A., South, N., (2014) Green Cultural Criminology: Constructions of Environmental Harm, Consumerism, and Resistance to Ecocide, , New York, Routledge; Cox, A., (2017) Trapped in a Vice: The Consequences of Confinement for Young People, , New Brunswick, NJ, Rutgers University Press; Coyne, S.M., Whitehead, E., Indirect aggression in animated Disney films (2008) Journal of Communication, 58 (2), pp. 382-395; Davis, O., Theorizing the advent of weaponized drones as techniques of domestic paramilitary policing (2019) Security Dialogue, 50 (4), pp. 344-360; De Leeuw, R.N.B., Buijzen, M., Introducing positive media psychology to the field of children, adolescents, and media (2016) Journal of Children and Media, 10 (1), pp. 39-46; Dennis, B., Mooney, C., Major Trump administration climate report says damage is “intensifying across the country (2018) Washington Post, , https://www.washingtonpost.com/energy-environment/2018/11/23/major-trump-administration-climate-report-says-damages-are-intensifying-across-country/?noredirect=on, 23, November; Di Ronco, A., Allen-Robertson, J., South, N., Representing environmental harm and resistance on Twitter: the case of the TAP pipeline in Italy (2019) Crime, Media, Culture, 15 (1), pp. 143-168; Downing, W., The misogyny and authoritarianism of “Paw Patrol (2018) Medium, , https://medium.com/s/story/paw-patrol-is-a-republican-dystopia-f178161fce54, 7, December; Doyle, A., How not to think about crime in the media (2006) Canadian Journal of Criminology and Criminal Justice, 48 (6), pp. 867-885; Goodman, P., Hero and inmate: work, prisons, and punishment in California’s fire camps (2012) Working USA: The Journal of Labor & Society, 15 (3), pp. 353-376; Green, D.A., Suitable vehicles: framing blame and justice children kill a child (2008) Crime, Media, Culture, 4 (2), pp. 197-220; Gunter, B., Harrison, J., Violence in children’s programmes on British television (1997) Children & Society, 11 (3), pp. 143-156; Hall, M., (2015) Exploring Green Crime: Introducing the Legal, Social and Criminological Contexts of Environmental Harm, , New York, Palgrave Macmillan; Hall, M., Nurse, A., Potter, G.R., The geography of environmental crime (2016) The Geography of Environmental Crime: Conservation, Wildlife Crime, and Environmental Activism, pp. 1-10. , Potter G.R., Nurse A., Hall M., (eds), London, Palgrave Macmillan,.

The importance of modernity to the phenomenon of serial murder is also considered utilizing Ultra-Realist theory, resulting in both a micro and macro examination into how the modern urban landscape has subsequently created an environment in which the serial killer both operates and comes to fruition. This synthesis between the application of literary devices, criminological theory and socio-cultural concepts not only raises important and previously neglected questions pertaining to serial murder, but also assists in forming the more sinister relative of the flâneur: the ‘dark flâneur’. © The Author(s) 2018.",Capitalism; flâneur; flâneuse; Levi Bellfield; literary; serial murder; ultra-realism,,,,,,,,,"Atkinson, R., Measuring gentrification and displacement in Greater London (2000) Urban Studies, 37 (1), pp. 149-165; Atkinson, R., Domestication by cappuccino or a revenge on urban space?

More recently, there has been a turn towards the spatial in the discipline. This article sets out an analytical framework that synthesizes spatial theory with hauntology. We demonstrate how a given space’s violent histories can become embedded in the texts that constitute it and the language that describes it. The art installation Die Familie Schneider is used as an example of how the incorporation of social trauma can lead to the formation of a spatial ‘crypt’. Cracking open this ‘crypt’ allows us to draw out Derrida’s notion of the spectre within the context of a ‘haunted’ city space. © The Author(s) 2018.",Crypt; hauntology; spatial theory; trauma; violence,,,,,,,"I would like to thank the two anonymous reviewers for their insightful and constructive comments.

Focusing primarily on grime, a host of unfair and illegitimate practices adopted by the London Metropolitan Police will be discussed. This will demonstrate how the routine monitoring, surveillance and curtailment of Black people’s public identity (re)produces stereotypical associations of Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic (BAME) groups with violent, criminal and problematic behaviour. In order to challenge openly discriminatory attitudes towards Black urban cultural forms by the police, a counterargument which calls for their understanding as viable sources of positive and constructive public engagement will be offered. © The Author(s) 2018.",Cultural criminology; grime; policing; race and crime; youth subcultures,,,,,,,,,"Back, L., (2007) The Art of Listening, , London, Berg; Baker, H.A., Jr., (1995) Black Studies, Rap, and the Academy, , Chicago, IL, University of Chicago Press; Barron, L., The sound of street corner society: UK grime music as ethnography (2013) European Journal of Cultural Studies, 16 (5), pp. 531-547; Bauman, Z., (1999) Culture as Praxis, , London, Sage; (2006) Megaman’s controversial career, , http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/4481112.stm, accessed 1 November 2017; Becker, H.S., (1973) Outsiders: Studies in the Sociology of Deviance, , New York, The Free Press; Benda, J., (1928) The Great Betrayal, , London, Routledge; Bennett, A., Harris, K.K., (2004) After Subculture: Critical Studies in Contemporary Youth Culture, , London, Palgrave; Bernard, J., Form 696 is gone – so why is clubland still hostile to black Londoners?

His trial was broadcast live, after media agencies applied to the court for comprehensive access to the courtroom. The decision to broadcast the trial followed a careful and deliberative court ruling about the constitutional principles of human dignity, freedom and equality. South Africa’s post-apartheid Constitution provides a framework for achieving social transformation, and open justice plays an important role in it. Despite concerns about sensationalism and voyeurism, the broadcast of the Pistorius trial functioned as a constitutional experiment. This article evaluates the principles and practices of open justice in South Africa through the broadcast of the Pistorius trial, and the roles played by the media, the courts and the public. It identifies significant events during the trial, including its reporting, which had the effect of testing the compatibility of open justice, on the one hand, and the proper administration of justice, on the other. The right of an accused to a fair trial, at times, confronted the sensitivities of the victim’s family, the rights of the media and the demands of the public to witness justice being done. This article examines the tangled relationship between dignity and justice, compounded by the technologies of digital media, in the unique context of post-apartheid South Africa. © The Author(s) 2018.",Criminal trials; dignity; open justice; Oscar Pistorius; South Africa; Ubuntu,,,,,,"Australian Research Council, ARC: DP 160100414, DP 130102224","I am grateful for the meticulous work of research assistants Althea Gibson, Starla Hargita and Divya Murthy.

Located in Branson, Missouri, the popular 1880s-themed Silver Dollar City proudly claims to offer historical education and entertainment through “realistic” constructions of the past. One of the park’s oldest and most popular attractions is the Flooded Mine ride, where park guests travel in “mine carts” through a depiction of a flooding mine, trying to “help the sheriff” by shooting laser light guns at kitschy animatronic convict laborers who are trying to escape. We first examine the Flooded Mine as a unique form of penal spectatorship, arguing that riders are able to enjoy the lighthearted mockery of the convict laborers’ suffering through a process of moral disengagement. Second, we use the lens of collective memory in an endeavor to expose the processes of remembering and forgetting at work in Silver Dollar City. We argue that the simulations of the past constructed in the park are not an apolitical platform for entertainment, but rather work to produce a narrative that perpetuates a kind of white nostalgia that erases black suffering. While ostensibly displaying a story of convict labor, the Flooded Mine depicts all the prisoners as white men, effectively performing an historical erasure of chattel slavery and its transmutation into convict leasing. By obscuring the incalculable pain produced by convict leasing and incarceration, the dissimulation allows riders to avoid any ethical engagement with these systems of racialized control. © The Author(s) 2018.",Collective memory; convict leasing; dark tourism; heritage production; penal spectatorship; penal tourism,,,,,,,"This research received no specific grant from any funding agency in the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors.",,"Adamkiewicz, E., White nostalgia: The absence of slavery and the commodification of white plantation nostalgia (2016) Aspeers: Emerging Voices in American Studies, 9, pp. 13-31; Aubrey, K., Sinning without consequences and other American dreams: Southern theme parks, restaurants, and vacation cities (1996) Studies in Popular Culture, 19 (2), pp. 39-47; Ball, M.S., Smith, G.W.H., (1992) Analyzing Visual Data, , Newbury Park, CA, SAGE; Barton, A., Brown, A., Dark tourism and the modern prison (2012) Prison Service Journal, 199, pp. 44-49; Barton, A., Brown, A., Show me the prison: The development of prison tourism in the UK (2015) Crime Media Culture, 11 (3), pp. 237-258; Bauman, Z., Social issues of law and order (2000) The British Journal of Sociology, 40, pp. 205-221; Bennett, J., The good, the bad and the ugly: The media in prison films (2006) Howard Journal of Criminal Justice, 45 (2), pp. 97-115; Biran, A., Hyde, K., New perspectives on dark tourism (2013) International Journal of Culture, Tourism and Hospitality Research, 7 (3), pp. 191-198; Blackmon, D.A., (2008) Slavery by Another Name: The Re-enslavement of Black Americans From the Civil War to World War II, , New York, Doubleday; Boskin, J., Dorinson, J., Ethnic humor: Subversion and survival (1985) American Quarterly, 37 (1), pp. 81-97; Brandon, J.C., Reversing the narrative of hillbilly history: A case study using archaeology at Van Winkle’s mill in the Arkansas Ozarks (2013) Historical Archaeology, 47 (3), pp. 36-51; (2017) Branson Missouri profile, , http://www.bransontourismcenter.com/articles/bransonarticle87, accessed 4 September 2017; Brown, M., (2009) The Culture of Punishment: Prison, Society, and Spectacle, , New York, NYU Press; Buzinde, C.N., Santos, C.A., Representations of slavery (2008) Annuals of Tourism Research, 35 (2), pp. 469-488; Cacho, L.M., (2012) Social Death: Racialized Rightlessness and the Criminalization of the Unprotected, , New York, NYU Press; Carrabine, E., The iconography of punishment (2011) The Howard Journal of Criminal Justice, 50 (7), pp. 452-464; Carrabine, E., Telling prison stories: The spectacle of punishment and the criminological imagination (2012) The Arts of Imprisonment: Control, Resistance, and Empowerment, pp. 47-72. , Cheliotis L.K., (ed), New York, Ashgate Publishing, In:, (ed; Carrabine, E., Iconic power, dark tourism, and the spectacle of suffering (2017) The Palgrave Handbook of Prison Tourism, pp. 13-36. , Wilson J.Z., Hodgkinson S., Piche J., (eds), London, Palgrave McMillan, In:, (eds; Chen, A., Fiander, S., Piche, J., Captive and captor representations at Canadian penal history museums (2016) Qualitative Sociology Review, 12 (4), pp. 22-42; Childs, D., ‘You ain’t seen nothin’ yet’: Beloved, the American chain gang, and the Middle Passage remix (2009) American Quarterly, 61 (2), pp. 271-297; Connerton, P., (1989) How Societies Remember, , New York, Cambridge University Press; D’Harlingue, B., (2011) Haunted tourism: Sites of violence and memory in the United States, , Department of Cultural Studies, University of California Davis, USA, PhD thesis; D’Harlingue, B., On the plantation with ghosts: Antagonisms of slavery tourism (2015) South Carolina Review, 47 (2), pp. 74-92; Eichstedt, J.L., Small, S., (2002) Representations of Slavery: Race and Ideology in Southern Plantation Museums, , Washington, DC, Smithsonian Institution Press; Fairclough, N., (2003) Analyzing Discourse: Textual Analysis for Social Research, , New York, Routledge; Fanon, F., (1967) Black Skin, White Masks, , New York, Grove Press; Ferrell, J., Hayward, K.J., Crime, media, and the image: Media, representation, and meaning: Inside the hall of mirrors (2011) Cultural Criminology: Theories of Crime.

Since that time, the nature and presence of those voices has changed shape and form from the influence and presence of victim centred organizations to the rise of the high profile individual victim.

Following a longstanding pattern, key actors framed both cases as revelatory and exceptional and used them as fodder for public condemnation and calls for reform. In order to confront and contest similar patterns of facile outrage, we theorize a cultural-cognitive process of disavowal, whereby the inherent violence of the US state is willfully situated by its subjects in politically and culturally redacted black spaces. Here, black spaces allow political subjects to disavow the many horrors—rendition, torture, murder—committed on their behalf and in the name of security. We argue that these are not simply metaphorical, imaginary spaces, but rather material landscapes linking the certainties of US imperial violence to routine and uncontested acts of police violence and the interrogation rooms, jail cells, and prisons of an intensely racialized, yet largely disowned mass-carceral regime. Our aim, then, is to map the state’s black spaces in order to demonstrate the reciprocities between war and police and to situate the politics of redaction within broader systems of violence and dispossession. © The Author(s) 2018.",Black sites;

Media coverage is often sensational and commonly portrays people living with HIV as hypersexualized threats to the (inter)national body politic. This article analyzes mainstream news media coverage of four HIV nondisclosure cases to examine how the accused (two men, two women) are constructed as sexual predators, which we found occurs through two key discursive moves. First, by tying the narrative to stereotypical conceptualizations of hegemonic and toxic masculinity and pariah femininity to construct the individual as promiscuous, hypersexual and dangerous. Second, by crafting a narrative that evokes complex moral emotions; notably, these include the ‘negative’ emotions of anger, disgust and fear. Given that racialized men are disproportionately represented and demonized in media accounts, and the tense race relations in the current western political landscape, it is important to consider how emotions (rather than medical evidence of the risks of transmission, intent to infect or actual transmission) might contribute to shaping punitive mentalities and the harsh application of the law. By examining how race, gender, class and sexuality are mobilized to construct narratives of Black masculinity as inherently toxic and women’s sexual freedom as exemplifying pariah femininity, and the ways in which the coverage evokes negative moral emotions, we contend that media coverage shores up moralized discourses about sexuality, masculinity and femininity and HIV/AIDS. © The Author(s) 2018.",Emotions; hegemonic masculinity; HIV nondisclosure; media; pariah femininity; predatory sexuality,,,,,,,,,"Abrams, K., Seeking emotional ends with legal means (2015) California Law Review, 103 (6), pp. 1657-1678; Abrams, K., Keren, H., Who’s afraid of law and the emotions?

Despite the view that men must be engaged in this conversation in order to be effective at preventing violence and changing deep-seated patriarchal attitudes, the place of male voices in this ongoing conversation is hotly in question. This article analyzes an unusual and controversial project by Thordis Elva and Tom Stranger, who, 20 years after Stranger raped Elva, produced a TED talk (2016) watched by over 3 million people, and a jointly written book, South of Forgiveness (Elva and Stranger, 2017), detailing their story of forgiveness and redemption. The first part of this article situates this unprecedented victim-rapist enterprise within the history of feminist anti-rape politics and men’s involvement in that politics, arguing that this project both instantiates, and critiques, an appeal to the ‘good man’. The second part analyzes the book South of Forgiveness as a survivor story that is more complex than the highly reductive format of a TED talk allows, and shows how its uneasy fit within the putative frameworks of ‘restorative’ or informal justice (as Elva and others claim it to be) is a function of the unacknowledged dimension to the performance in the form of revenge. The third part of the article turns to Elva’s and Stranger’s public performances that began with the TED talk and book tour, which we attended, to show how this function of revenge played out theatrically and implicates the spectator as bystander and witness. We conclude by reflecting upon the implications of listening to male perpetrators speak against sexual violence against women and our responsibility towards these questions as feminist legal academics. © The Author(s) 2018.",Anti-rape activism; feminism; online culture; performance; rape; sexual violence,,,,,,,,,"(2017) Q&A: All-women panel discusses rape and forgiveness ahead of International Women’s Day, , http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-03-07/q&a-talks-rape-and-forgiveness-with-all-women-panel/8329914, 7, March, accessed 16 April 2018; (2017) Thordis Elva and Tom Stranger speak about rape as a survivor and a perpetrator, , http://www.abc.net.au/radio/programs/conversations/conversations-thordis-elva-tom-stranger/8308824, 6, March, accessed 16 April 2018; Achroft, E., Why we should let a self-confessed rapist talk in Bristol (2017) Bristol Post, , http://www.bristolpost.co.uk/news/bristol-news/should-self-confessed-rapist-talk-7100, 7, March, accessed 16 April 2018; Alcoff, L., Gray, L., Survivor discourse: Transgression or recuperation?

Through portraying a surveillance society of pre-crime and algorithmic policing, Psycho-Pass raises important questions about the datafication of crime and its role in facilitating increasingly invasive and ubiquitous forms of social control. Psycho-Pass, I argue, encourages us to question a society of algorithmic tyranny: a society where the overwhelming majority of classifications are driven by algorithms, and where crime has been reduced to a data object and ‘measureable type’. I conclude my case for incorporating the technological imagination of science fiction into the criminological imagination through identifying three key resources the genre may offer criminologists: archaeological, pedagogical and capacity building for reflexive governance. © The Author(s) 2018.",Anime; digital criminology; popular criminology; pre-crime; predictive policing; science fiction; surveillance,,,,,,,,,"Aas, K.F., ‘The body does not lie’: Identity, risk and trust in technoculture (2006) Crime Media Culture, 2 (2), pp. 143-158; Aas, K.F., ‘The Earth is one but the world is not’: Criminological theory and its geopolitical divisions (2012) Theoretical Criminology, 16 (1), pp. 5-20; Asimov, I., Social science fiction (1953) Modern Science Fiction: Its Meaning and Its Future, pp. 157-196. , Bretnor R., (ed), New York, NY, Coward-McCann, In:, (ed; Atherton, M.C., Teaching through film: Utilizing popular criminology in the classroom (2013) Journal on Excellence in College Teaching, 24 (2), pp. 77-99; Beer, D., Power through the algorithm?

This article presents an interdisciplinary analysis (drawing on sociology, media and communications and organizational studies) of the potential influence of media consumption practices on penal tastes among diverse participant groups. We aim to develop a clearer understanding of how these processes shape the public legitimacy of community sanctions. In particular, we report on original research employing innovative methodologies to explore the dynamic set of practices deployed by audiences in the process of making meaningful the media landscape on punishment and community sanctions. Our findings offer some confirmation of the primacy of the prison in the popular imagination; the media profile of community sanctions is delimited by their perceived banality, in turn leading to confusion surrounding their purpose and potential. However, this study suggests that the legitimacy problem for community sanctions may be far more complex than ‘newsworthiness’. Community sanctions, we argue, may be subject to appraisal in line with penal ‘tastes’ in which the function of moral censure is of central significance. However, we also uncover some evidence about how traditional markers of taste are disrupted by processes of media convergence (of appropriation, circulation, response) in ways which can operate to limit deliberation even amongst more liberal audience groups, and conversely open it up amongst those who are more punitive. © The Author(s) 2018.",Bourdieu; community sanctions; legitimacy; media; payback; punishment; unpaid work,,,,,,,"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship and/or publication of this article: This article is based on research funded by British Academy/Leverhulme Small Research Grant Ref.

This article considers how state narratives and visual rhetoric emerging from Byrne’s murder emboldened the police power and a revanchist campaign aimed at “taking back the streets” secreted under the war on drugs. As such, this case powerfully illustrates a disparate politics of death and the ways that the state enlists thanatopolitical power in order to reaffirm and reproduce its sovereign authority. Such a reproduction or reanimation of power registers as the state’s ability to unleash violence unequivocally and unequally upon poor and marginalized communities, as later demonstrated by the legal and proper police murder of Sean Bell, a resident of South Jamaica, Queens killed by NYPD agents in 2006. © The Author(s) 2018.",Edward Byrne; police death; police violence; revanchist; Sean Bell; Thanatopolitics,,,,,,,,,"Agamben, G., (1998) Homo Sacer: Sovereign Power and Bare Life, , Heller-Roazen D., (ed), Stanford, CA, Stanford University Press, Translated by; Althusser, L., (2014) On the Reproduction of Capitalism: Ideology and Ideological State Apparatuses, , Brooklyn, NY, Verso Books; Arbona, J., Forget me not (2015) The New Inquiry, , http://thenewinquiry.com/essays/forget-me-not/, 21, October, accessed 2 July 2017; Auchter, J., (2014) The Politics of Haunting and Memory in International Relations, , London and New York, Routledge; Balko, R., (2013) Rise of the Warrior Cop: The Militarization of American Police Forces, , New York, PublicAffairs; Barron, J., Inquiry in officer’s slaying is said to be stalled (1988) The New York Times, p.

Findings reveal that depictions of bath salts use in local news stories drew on three overlapping frames of risk and harm: a medical/health frame, a typifying example/atrocity story frame, and a legal/regulatory frame. User narratives were comparably neutral and richly descriptive, with tempered accounts of drug effects, psychopharmacological and other experiences while using, as well as tactics used to counter unpleasant effects. We find that both media forms limit discussions of drug use and risks of harm and are similarly dependent on a medical/health frame to legitimate them. The problem with news accounts is the denial of complex social and cultural contexts and possibilities regarding alternative drug policies. The problem with user narratives is the extent to which their accounts are moderated or excluded in order to manufacture a coherent public presentation of self, serving alternate ideological aims. © The Author(s) 2018.",Bath salts; drug scares; harm reduction; media panic; novel psychoactive drugs; risk; war on drugs,,,,,,,,,"Alexandrescu, L., Mephedrone, assassin of youth: The rhetoric of fear in contemporary drugs scares (2014) Crime, Media, Culture, 10 (1), pp. 23-37; Altheide, D.L., (1996) Qualitative Media Analysis, , Thousand Oaks, CA, SAGE; Altheide, D.L., The news media, the problem frame, and the production of fear (1997) The Sociological Quarterly, 38 (4), pp. 647-668; Altheide, D.L., Michalowski, R.S., Fear in the news: A discourse of control (1999) The Sociological Quarterly, 40 (3), pp. 475-503; Armstrong, E.G., Moral panic over meth (2007) Contemporary Justice Review, 10 (4), pp. 427-442; Beckmann, L., The disturbing 18-minute Miami zombie attack, caught on surveillance camera (2012) Gawker, , http://gawker.com/5914352/, 30, May, accessed 3 June 2017; Berg, B., (2003) Qualitative Research Methods for the Social Sciences, , 5th edition., Boston, MA, Allyn & Bacon; Best, J., (2008) Social Problems, , New York, W.W.

At the same time, the work of the current Conservative Government on criminal justice policy as a whole, and on prisons in particular, has been seen by many as a marked departure from their previous penal policy agenda, heralding a new, progressive and broadly liberal direction. Focusing on Michael Gove’s rhetoric on prison reform during his term as Justice Secretary (May 2015 to July 2016), this article uses critical discourse analysis (CDA) to examine how Gove employed a variety of discursive strategies to create an impression of a liberal, progressive reform agenda, while simultaneously reinforcing the need for an expansive and punitive prison system. Building on recent work on agnotology, it shows that Gove strategically selected, deflected, distorted and ignored the available evidence on prisons. In doing so, he effectively legitimized and reinforced the central role of the prison in the criminal justice system despite increasing evidence of its inefficacy, foreclosing discussion of genuinely radical alternatives. © The Author(s) 2017.",Agnotology; critical discourse analysis; ignorance; Michael Gove; prison reform,,,,,,"Economic and Social Research Council, ESRC","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This research was supported by an Economic and Social Research Council Studentship.",,"Editorial: The Government’s commitment to prisons is a welcome, but overdue, reform (2016) The Independent, , http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/editorials/the-governments-commitment-to-prisons-in-the-queens-speech-is-a-welcome-but-overdue-reform-a7035946.html, 18, May, accessed 27 July 2017; Bederman, G., (1996) Manliness and Civilization: A Cultural History of Gender and Race in the United States, 1880–1917, , Chicago, IL, University of Chicago Press; Bulman, M., Fury as prison reform is dropped from Queen’s Speech (2017) The Independent, , http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/queens-speech-latest-chief-inspector-prisons-their-name-furious-reform-theresa-may-legislative-a7800851.html, 21, June, accessed 2 August 2017; Colomb, C., Unpacking New Labour’s ‘Urban Renaissance’ agenda: Towards a socially sustainable reurbanization of British cities?

The article also draws on extensive ethnographic research into London’s graffiti subculture, as well as in-depth semi-structured interviews with several generations of graffiti writers. The article proceeds in four parts. The first part reflects on three sources of methodological inspiration: unauthorised urban exploration and documentation; more-or-less formal archaeological studies of graffiti; and ‘ghost ethnography’, an emergent methodological orientation which places an emphasis on absence and the interpretation of material and atmospheric traces. The second part of the article considers recent theoretical work associated with the ‘spectral turn’. Here, ghosts and haunting provide useful conceptual metaphors for thinking about lingering material and atmospheric traces of the past. The third part of the article offers some methodological caveats and reflections. The fourth and final part of the article seeks to connect theory and method, and asks what significance can be drawn from unauthorised encounters with graffiti ‘ghosts’. © The Author(s) 2017.",cultural criminology; ghost ethnography; graffiti; hauntology; spectral; urban exploration,,,,,,,,,"Adey, P., Airports, mobility and the calculative architecture of affective control (2008) Geoforum, 39 (1), pp. 438-451; Anderson, B., Affective atmospheres (2009) Emotion, Space and Society, 2 (2), pp. 77-81; Aoki, J., Yoshimizu, A., Walking histories un/making places: Walking tours as ethnography of place (2015) Space and Culture, 18 (3), pp. 273-284; Armstrong, J., On the possibility of a spectral ethnography (2010) Cultural Studies ↔ Critical Methodologies, 10 (3), pp. 243-250; Ashford, D., (2013) London Underground: A Cultural Geography, , Liverpool, Liverpool University Press; Augé, M., (1995) Non-Places: Introduction to an Anthropology of Supermodernity, , London, Verso; Baird, J.A., Taylor, C., (2010) Ancient Graffiti in Context, , London, Routledge, (eds; Baker, P., Secret city: Psychogeography and the end of London (2012) London from Punk to Blair, pp. 277-291. , Kerr J., Gibson A., (eds), 2nd edn., London, Reaktion, In:, (eds; Bell, M.M., The ghosts of place (1997) Theory and Society, 26 (6), pp. 813-836; Benjamin, W., Benjamin, W., A Berlin chronicle (1979) One Way Street and Other Writings, pp. 293-346. , Jephcott E., Shorter K., (eds), London, NLB, 1932, (, [,]), In:, Translated by; Benjamin, W., (1991) Gesammelte Schriften, , Frankfurt, Suhrkamp; Bennett, L., Bunkerology – A case study in the theory and practice of urban exploration (2011) Environment and Planning D: Society and Space, 29 (3), pp. 421-434; Berardi, F., (2011) After the Future, , Edinburgh, AK Press; Bissell, D., Passenger mobilities: Affective atmospheres and the sociality of public transport (2010) Environment and Planning D: Society and Space, 28 (2), pp. 270-289; Böhme, G., Atmosphere as the fundamental concept of a new aesthetics (1993) Thesis Eleven, 36, pp. 113-126; Booth, W., (1890) In Darkest England and the Way Out, , London, Salvation Army; Bunge, B., The first years of the Detroit Geographical Expedition (1977) Radical Geography, pp. 31-39. , Peet R., (ed), Chicago, IL, Maaroufa Press, In:, (ed; Cacho, L.M., (2012) Social Death: Racialized Rightlessness and the Criminalization of the Unprotected, , New York, New York University Press; Campbell, E., Landscapes of performance: Stalking as choreography (2012) Environment and Planning D, 30 (3), pp. 400-417; Casella, E.C., Enmeshed inscriptions: Reading the graffiti of Australia’s convict past (2014) Australian Archaeology, 78 (1), pp. 108-112; Casella, E.C., Enmeshed inscriptions: Reading the graffiti of Australia’s convict past (2016) Australian Archaeology, 78 (1), pp. 108-112; Castleman, C., (1982) Getting Up: Subway Graffiti in New York, , Cambridge, MA, MIT Press; Castree, N., Kitchin, R., Rogers, A., (2013) A Dictionary of Human Geography, , Oxford, Oxford University Press; Champion, M., (2015) Medieval Graffiti: The Lost Voices of England’s Churches, , London, Ebury Press; Cianci, L., Schutt, S., Keepers of ghosts: Old signs, new media and the age of archival flux (2014) Archives and Manuscripts, 42 (1), pp. 19-32; Corsín Jiménez, A., On space as a capacity (2003) Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute, 9, pp. 137-153; Davis, C., Hauntology, spectres and phantoms (2005) French Studies, 59 (3), pp. 373-379; De Certeau, M., (1984) The Practice of Everyday Life, , Berkeley, CA and Los Angeles, CA, University of California Press; De Certeau, M., (1998) The Practice of Everyday Life.

Subsequently, ‘Mt Eden’, a public prison, was contracted to Serco and a second prison, ‘Wiri’, was built under contract to the same company. Despite glowing performance reports, Serco’s reputation was significantly damaged when cell-phone video capturing Mt Eden prisoners engaged in fights, in full view of prison officers and CCTV, was uploaded to YouTube in July 2015. An unprecedented stream of media revelations about prisoner mistreatment, corruption and serious human rights violations followed, prompting the Department of Corrections to seize control of the prison. This article examines the potential of this human rights based scandal to challenge the legitimacy of private prisons in NZ. Where previously, prison legitimacy largely revolved around representations of managerialism, security and the maintenance of austere conditions, the revelations at Mt Eden highlighted a moment when penal legitimacy fractured for being too severe and non-humanitarian. Drawing upon analysis of media articles (n = 648) over seven years (2009–2016) from three major sources (the New Zealand Herald, Stuff News and Radio NZ), the article demonstrates how journalists quickly reverted to traditional discursive frames on imprisonment. Representing the crisis as an unfortunate aberration that could be managed through government controls, mainstream media helped to consolidate and ultimately strengthen the legitimacy of the prison in NZ. © The Author(s) 2017.",Human rights; media; New Zealand; prison legitimacy; privatisation; scandal; Serco,,,,,,Royal Society of New Zealand,"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This writing of this article was supported by a Rutherford Discovery Fellowship, administered by the Royal Society of New Zealand, and funded by the New Zealand government.",,"(2016) Top sites in New Zealand, , http://www.alexa.com/topsites/countries/NZ, accessed 31 January 2017; Armstrong, S., Bureaucracy, private prisons and the future of penal reform (2003) Buffalo Criminal Law Review, 7 (1), pp. 275-306; Bartlett, T., (2009) The power of penal populism, , Victoria University of Wellington, New Zealand, Master’s thesis; Becker, H.S., Whose side are we on?

Along with terrorist attacks in Europe over the last decade, the refugee crisis has fueled a rise in the popularity of both far-right political parties and extremist groups—such as Finland’s Soldiers of Odin (S.O.O.). The group debuted in late 2015, but quickly spread throughout Scandinavia. The popularity of S.O.O. coincided with a resurgent interest in Viking culture, and new country groups have been reported worldwide. This article explores the contested identity of the Norwegian chapter, Soldiers of Odin Norge (S.O.O.N.), in national news (Norge) and networked spaces (social media). The mediated discourse was analyzed using ethnographic content analysis, with an appreciation for the intertextuality of the ambiguous political rhetoric. We found social media to be an important site for contesting the dominant narrative of ‘vigilante’ identified in the news articles. Drawing from cultural criminology, we further explored the contrast between mediated images, where Viking culture became the symbolic identifier for S.O.O.N., and the collective construction of meaning in the discourse. Finally, we argue that because the group’s identity was forged from, and exists because of, media-related communications, S.O.O.N. could be characterized as a ‘media-based collectivity’ (Couldry and Hepp, 2017). © The Author(s) 2017.",Cultural criminology; ethnographic content analysis; media-based collectivity; Soldiers of Odin Norge; Viking culture,,,,,,,,,"Altheide, D.L., Coyle, M.J., Smart on crime: The new language for prisoner release (2006) Crime Media Culture, 2 (3), pp. 286-303; Altheide, D.L., Schneider, C.J., (2013) Qualitative Media Analysis, , 2nd edn., Thousand Oaks, CA, SAGE; Aruguete, N., The agenda setting hypothesis in the new media environment (2017) Comunicacion y Sociedad, 28, pp. 35-58; Bakhtin, M., (1986) Speech Genres and Other Late Essays, , Austin, TX, University of Texas Press; Barlas Bozkus, S., Pop polyvocality and internet memes: As a reflection of socio-political discourse of Turkish youth in social media (2016) Global Media Journal TR Edition, 6 (12), pp. 44-73; Berger, P.L., Luckmann, T., (1966) The Social Construction of Reality, , London, Penguin; Castells, M., (1997) The Power of Identity: The Information Age: Economy, Society, and Culture, Volume II, , Malden, MA, Blackwell Publishers; Castells, M., (2009) Communication Power, , Oxford and New York, Oxford University Press; Coleman, J., Cologne sex attacks: Search for answers (2016) BBC, , http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-35241808, 8, January, accessed 7 February 2017; Couldry, N., Hepp, A., (2017) The Mediated Construction of Reality, , Cambridge, MA, Polity Press; Crouch, D., Sweden and Denmark crack down on refugees at borders (2016) The Guardian, , https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/03/sweden-to-impose-id-checks-on-travellers-from-denmark, 4, January, accessed 22 December 2016; Dobratz, B.A., The role of religion in the collective identity of the white racialist movement (2001) Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion, 40 (2), pp. 287-302; Elias, N., (1991) The Society of Individuals, , London, Continuum International Publishing, 1939, (, [,]; Fangen, K., Carlsson, Y., Right-wing extremism in Norway: Prevention and intervention (2013) Right-Wing Extremism in Europe: Country Analyses, Counter-Strategies and Labor-Market Oriented Exit Strategies, pp. 327-357. , Melzer R., Serafin S., (eds), Berlin, Friedrich Ebert Foundation, In:, (eds; Ferber, A.L., (1998) White Man Falling: Race, Gender, and White Supremacy, , Lanham, MD, Rowman and Littlefield; Ferrell, J., Hayward, K., Young, J., (2015) Cultural Criminology: An Invitation, , 2nd edn., Thousand Oaks, CA, SAGE Publications; Fishwick, E., Mak, H., Fighting crime, battling injustice: The world of real-life superheroes (2015) Crime Media Culture, 11 (3), pp. 335-356; Fiske, J., (1987) Television Culture, , London, Routledge; Frank, A.W., (2010) Letting Stories Breathe, , Chicago, IL, The University of Chicago Press; Gajaria, A., Yeung, E., Goodale, T., Beliefs about attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and response to stereotypes: Youth postings in Facebook groups (2011) Journal of Adolescent Health, 49, pp. 15-20; Hagelund, A., A matter of decency?

Yet today, by comparison with other environmental matters, noise and protection from its effects are often overlooked, except in specialist fields such as architecture or planning. One major reason for this may be that noise does not possess the same ability to spread that is characteristic of other forms of pollution. Noise is also an unusual form of environmental pollution in having a physical impact – it is ‘heard’ and can be ‘felt’ – but is predominantly interpreted subjectively. The impact and consequences of anthropogenic noise for humans and biodiversity in general are currently under-investigated in criminology and are under-addressed in both public and private international environmental law. Here we question why noise has not (so far) been explored within green criminology and only tentatively explored within cultural criminology. The objectives are to provide an overview of noise as a topic, connecting media, culture and anti- and pro-social behaviour, and to unearth interconnections between the matter of noise and its implications for the environment. © The Author(s) 2018.",Aesthetic criminology; environmental law; green cultural criminology; noise; sensory criminology,,,,,,,,,"Agnew, R., The ordinary acts that contribute to ecocide: A criminological analysis (2013) Routledge International Handbook of Green Criminology, pp. 58-72. , South N., Brisman A., (eds), New York, Routledge, In:, (eds; Atkinson, R., Ecology of sound: The sonic order of urban space (2007) Urban Studies, 44 (10), pp. 1905-1917; Atkinson, R., The sonic ghetto (2014) Crime Capital: urban life in superpolarised cities, , https://autotomically.wordpress.com/2014/10/25/the-sonic-ghetto/, 25, October, accessed 21 November 2017; Atkinson, R., The sonic island: Urban noise and the value of isolation (2015) Crime Capital: urban life in super-polarised cities, , https://autotomically.wordpress.com/category/anti-social-behaviour/, 10, March, accessed 31 July 2017; Barber, J., Crooks, K., Fristrup, K., The costs of chronic noise exposure for terrestrial organisms (2010) Trends in Ecology & Evolution, 25 (3), pp. 180-189; Barnes, R., Hughes, R., (2004) An Introduction to Marine Ecology, , 3th edn., Oxford, Wiley-Blackwell; Bechtel, R.B., (1997) Environment and Behavior: An Introduction, , Thousand Oaks, CA, Sage; Bell, A., Noise: An occupational hazard and public nuisance (1966) Public Health Papers, , 30.

In this article, I will focus on the case of the Dutch Rollin 200 Crips from the city of The Hague, drawing on three years of fieldwork (2011–2013) in a small neighbourhood that this Dutch ‘gang’ claims as their ‘h200d’. The history of the Rollin 200 Crips shows their deeply rooted connection to the locality, whilst the influences from global street and gang cultures simultaneously resonates in both the name of the gang and their street spatial practices. By looking at the ways these Dutch Crips engage in acts of territoriality, I want to build on Ilan’s (2013: 5–7; 2015: 75) and Fraser’s (2013, 2015) observations that there is a need to revisit some of the assumptions that underpin the understanding of street spatial practices and specifically the way young people understand and construct space and identity. This case study highlights the interconnection between space and identity, both in terms of how the gang identity of these Dutch Crips influences their usage of space, but also how space is used in the construction of personal identities. © The Author(s) 2017.",Ethnography; gangs; identity; space; territoriality,,,,,,"Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek, NWO: 432-08-089

The different stages of gang glocalization, and the motives to engage in this process, are examined by comparison of two empirical cases – Congolese gangs in Brussels and Afro-Caribbean gangs in London. This multi-sited ethnography finds that youth use fiction and imagination in order to create individual and collective gang identities. Police and political action against gangs is then informed by the same fiction and imagination, resulting in new gang realities based not on what is real. We find that mythmaking is an essential aspect of gangs – without the myth there is no gang – and that imagination is at the core of some of its most harmful activities, namely spectacular symbolic violence. This is an update on Thrasher’s (1927) old themes. The driving forces behind gang glocalization are emotions and desires tied to lived experiences of social and cultural exclusion. Implications for research and practice follow. © The Author(s) 2018.",Ethnography; gangs; globalization; imagination; race,,,,,,,,,"Alexander, J., (2003) The Meanings of Social Life, , New York, Oxford University Press; Anderson, E., (1999) Code of the Street, , New York, W.W.

Such initiatives tend to be based on the idea that transmitting the courtroom boosts transparency and with it public trust in criminal justice. This is an untested ambition. Moreover, the idea that filming opens a window onto the courtroom comes up against the reality that any transmission entails translation, involving choices and compromises. Based on an in-depth study of courtroom filming and audience response, this article identifies two globally dominant stylistic modes and analyses their meaning and reception. We found that different stylistic modes prompt different types of audience engagement and allow for different levels of comprehension. The analysis therefore provides an insight into how courtroom footage is consumed by the viewing public. It also contributes to our understanding of the norms and values of institutional transparency. © The Author(s) 2019.",Audience response; courtroom filming; public trust; transparency,,,,,,,,,"Barrett, E., Bolt, B., (2010) Practice as Research: Approaches to Creative Arts Enquiry, , London, I.B.

To this end, we analyze news media coverage of a sample of National Hockey League suspensions to explore how the sporting world disseminates cultural messages about crime and punishment. Our analysis reveals that athlete “offenders” are likened to Lombrosian evolutionary throwbacks whose brutal on-ice violence recalls a less civilized past. Images of blood spilled on the ice and bodies carried away on stretchers shock our sensibilities. We argue that, as the arbiter of supplemental discipline, the National Hockey League regulates the bodies under its control and aims to signify that hockey and its fans are encapsulated in what Elias famously calls civilizing processes rather than mere barbaric sporting games. We situate these findings in the reemergence of a bio(social) criminology and express concerns regarding the spread of this rhetoric. © The Author(s) 2019.",Biosocial criminology; civilizing processes; sport; violence; visual criminology,,,,,,,,,"Adami, H., Bullies” stigma still lingers (2007) Vancouver Sun, , 31, October, (, a; Adami, H., Please, no more apologies (2007) Ottawa Citizen, p.

Following a review of this literature, we empirically interrogate notions of the ‘realistic’ and the ‘violent’ during gameplay, finding that the undertones of systemic, structural, capitalistic violence are experienced by players as providing the gritty sense of the ‘real’ that the game has been criticised for. Using Galtung’s concept of ‘structural violence’ and Žižek’s notion of the ‘real’, we unpack structural violence as the forerunning violent experience in the open world game. Due to the hidden and subdued nature of this violence, often taken for granted and experienced passively, we argue that it is the most impactful player experience that simultaneously makes the game playable and contextualises violent game activities. For cultural criminology, our data suggest that embedded and discrete forms of violence should be the leading edge of concern when studying the digital economy and playable forms of social harm. © The Author(s) 2019.",Deviant leisure; GTA; structural violence; systemic violence; video games,,,,,,,,,"Anderson, C., Bushman, B., Effects of violent video games on aggressive behavior, aggressive cognition, aggressive affect, physiological arousal, and prosocial behavior: a meta-analytic review of the scientific literature (2001) Psychological Science, 12 (5), pp. 353-359; Annandale, A., The subversive carnival of Grand Theft Auto (2006) The Meaning and Culture of Grand Theft Auto: Critical Essays, pp. 88-103. , Garrelts N., (ed), Jefferson, NC, McFarland, In:, (ed; Atkinson, R., Blandy, S., Introduction: international perspectives on the new enclavism and the rise of gated communities (2006) Housing Studies, 20 (2), pp. 177-186; Atkinson, R., Rodgers, T., Pleasure zones and murder boxes: online pornography and violent video games as cultural zones of exception (2016) The British Journal of Criminology, 56 (6), pp. 1297-1307; Atkinson, R., Willis, P., Charting the ludodrome: the mediation of urban and simulated space and rise of the flâneur electronique (2007) Information, Communication & Society, 10, pp. 818-845; Bauman, Z., (2007) Consuming Life, , Cambridge, Polity Press; Bogost, I., Klainbaum, D., Experiencing place in Los Santos and Vice City (2006) The Meaning and Culture of Grand Theft Auto: Critical Essays, pp. 162-176. , Garrelts N., (ed), Jefferson, NC, McFarland, In:, (ed; Boyatzis, R., (1998) Transforming Qualitative Information: Thematic Analysis and Code Development, , Thousand Oaks, CA, SAGE; Cheng, K., Cairns, P., Behaviour, realism and immersion in games (2005) CHI’05 extended abstracts on human factors in computing systems, pp. 1272-1275. , https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1056894, ACM, In; DeLisi, M., Vaughn, M.G., Gentile, D.A., Violent video games, delinquency, and youth violence: new evidence (2013) Youth Violence and Juvenile Justice, 11 (2), pp. 132-142; Denham, J., Spokes, M., Thinking outside the ‘murder box’: virtual violence and pro-social action in video games (2018) The British Journal of Criminology, 39 (3), pp. 737-755; DeVane, B., Squire, K.D., The meaning of race and violence in Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas (2008) Games and Culture, 3 (3-4), pp. 264-285; Dill, K., Dill, J., Video game violence: a review of the empirical literature (1998) Aggressive and Violent Behavior, 3 (4), pp. 407-428; Dominick, J.R., Videogames, television violence, and aggression in teenagers (1984) Journal of Communication, 34 (2), pp. 136-147; Donnelly, J., (2018) GTA 5 estimated to be the most profitable entertainment product of all time, 9 April, , https://www.pcgamer.com/gta-5-estimated-to-be-the-most-profitable-entertainment-product-of-all-time/, accessed 7 June 2018; Ducharme, J., Trump Blames video games for school shootings.

People make sense of their experiences with race and racism through time, from a present standpoint of incarceration or freedom, in retrospect via proximate and distant memories of injustices, and toward a vision of the future. I juxtapose mainstream autobiographies from Malcolm X to Shaka Senghor with public blog posts from individuals incarcerated who provide autobiographical accounts to the world. I find that generations of incarcerated people who came of age during the height of the War on Drugs of the 1980s and 1990s project a narrative of a neoliberal subject who has a more individualistic and de-racialized idea of transforming their moral self and community. This contradicts with the way they portray prison as being a conduit for creating communities of racial solidarity and racial consciousness. Highly influenced and inspired by other narratives of radical prisoners of conscience of the 1960s and 1970s who were prone to view their liberation, and of the Black community, through vanquishing White supremacy, the new generation speaks to the color-blind narratives that pervade mainstream society and possible in narrative interventions correctional program. © The Author(s) 2019.",Autobiographical narrative; critical race theory; liminality; narrative criminology; prison narrative; temporality,,,,,,,,,"Abu-Jamal, M., (1995) Live from Death Row, , Boston, MA, Addison-Wesley; Alexander, M., (2012) The New Jim Crow: Mass Incarceration in the Age of Colorblindness, , New York, The New Press; Anderson, E., (2000) Code of the Street: Decency, Violence, and the Moral Life of the Inner City, , New York, W.W.

Although these justice claims never progressed to a court of law, they were heard, through the media, by the court of public opinion. This article considers to what extent a ‘trial by media’ might have the potential to provide a parallel justice forum. It questions how activists and victims view the role of the media in seeking justice. It finds they perceive the media’s key functions are to expose crimes, bear witness to crimes, name perpetrators, influence public opinion and apply pressure on legal and political institutions to respond to human rights abuses. However, victims and activists also recognise the media is limited in delivering justice. Therefore, this article argues a trial by media should be conceived of more as an accountability mechanism that has the capacity to draw attention to the shortcomings of official legal responses and processes. © The Author(s) 2019.",Human rights; justice; Sri Lanka; trial by media; war crimes,,,,,,,,,"(2009) Twenty years of make-believe: Sri Lanka’s commissions of inquiry, , https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/ASA37/005/2009/en/, accessed 21 March 2019; Anonymous, Against the grain: pursuing a transitional justice agenda in post-war Sri Lanka (2011) International Journal of Transitional Justice, 5, pp. 31-51; (2011) Over 130 media reports in a fortnight on Sri Lankan war crimes and CHOGM, , https://tamiljustice.wordpress.com/2011/11/08/over-130-media-reports-in-a-fortnight-on-sri-lankan-war-crimes-and-chogm/, accessed 21 March 2019; Balint, J., (2012) Genocide, State Crime and the Law: In the Name of the State, , London, Routledge; Barrie, D., Naming and shaming: trial by media in nineteenth-century Scotland (2015) Journal of British Studies, 54, pp. 349-376; Begicevic, A., Money as justice: the case of Bosnia and Herzegovina (2016) Oñati Socio-Legal Series, 6 (3), pp. 396-425; Bleiker, R., Campbell, D., Hutchison, E., Nicholson, X., The visual dehumanisation of refugees (2013) Australian Journal of Political Science, 48 (4), pp. 398-416; Blumler, J., Gurevitch, M., (1995) The Crisis of Public Communication, , London, Routledge; Chagnon, N., Chesney-Lind, M., ‘Someone’s been in the house’: a tale of burglary and trial by media (2015) Crime, Media, Culture, 11 (1), pp. 41-60; Chomsky, N., Herman, E., (1988) Manufacturing Consent: The Political Economy of the Mass Media, , New York, Pantheon Books; Cohen, S., (1972) Folk Devils and Moral Panics: The Creation of the Mods and Rockers, , London, MacGibbon and Kee; Cohen, S., State crimes of previous regimes: knowledge, accountability, and the policing of the past (1995) Law and Social Inquiry, 20 (1), pp. 7-50; Cottle, S., (2004) The Racist Murder of Stephen Lawrence, , London, Praeger; Curran, J., Rethinking media and democracy (2005) Mass Media and Society, , Curran J., Gurevitch M., (eds), London, Hodder Arnold, In:, (eds; DeVotta, N., (2004) Blowback: Linguistic Nationalism, Institutional Decay and Ethnic Conflict in Sri Lanka, , Stanford, CA, Stanford University Press; Dingle, S., Allegations of Sri Lankan war crimes in the spotlight (2011) ABC 7.30, , https://www.abc.net.au/7.30/sri-lankan-president-under-investigation/3577844, 18, October; Ericson, R.V., Baranek, P.M., Chan, J.B., (1991) Representing Order: Crime, Law, and Justice in the News Media, , Milton Keynes, Open University Press; Fox, R., Van Sickel, R.W., Steiger, T.L., (2007) Tabloid Justice: Criminal Justice in an Age of Media Frenzy, , Boulder, CO, Lynne Rienner Publishers; Fraser, N., Rethinking the public sphere: a contribution to the critique of actually existing democracy (1990) Social Text, 25-26, pp. 56-80; Geertz, C., Thick description: toward an interpretive theory of culture (1973) The Interpretation of Cultures: Selected Essays, pp. 3-36. , Geertz C., (ed), New York, Basic Books, In:, (ed; Gready, P., Robins, S., From transitional to transformative justice: a new agenda for practice (2014) International Journal of Transitional Justice, 8 (3), pp. 339-361; Green, P., Ward, T., (2004) State Crime: Governments, Violence and Corruption, , London, Pluto Press; Greer, C., McLaughlin, E., ‘Trial by media’: policing, the 24–7 news mediasphere and the ‘politics of outrage’ (2011) Theoretical Criminology, 15 (1), pp. 23-46; Greer, C., McLaughlin, E., Media justice: Madeleine McCann, intermediatization and ‘trial by media’ in the British press (2012) Theoretical Criminology, 16 (4), pp. 395-416; Greer, C., McLaughlin, E., The Sir Jimmy Savile scandal: child sexual abuse and institutional denial at the BBC (2013) Crime, Media, Culture, 9 (3), pp. 243-263; Greer, C., McLaughlin, E., Theorizing institutional scandal and the regulatory state (2017) Theoretical Criminology, 21 (2), pp. 112-132; Henry, N., Witness to rape: the limits and potential of international war crimes trials for victims of wartime sexual violence (2014) International Journal of Transitional Justice, 3 (1), pp. 114-134; Hobbs, M., McKnight, D., ‘Kick this mob out’: the Murdoch media and the Australian Labor Government (2007 to 2013) (2014) Global Media Journal, 8 (2), pp. 1-13; Hoglund, K., Orjuela, C., Winning the peace: conflict prevention after a victor’s peace in Sri Lanka (2011) Contemporary Social Science, 6 (1), pp. 19-37; Horowitz, I., (1976) Genocide: State Power and Mass Murder, , New Brunswick, NJ, Transaction Books; (2010) The Sri Lankan Tamil diaspora after the LTTE, , https://www.crisisgroup.org/asia/south-asia/sri-lanka/b152-sri-lanka-stepping-back-constitutional-crisis, 23, February, Asia Report 186; Jewkes, Y., (2015) Media and Crime, , London, SAGE; Karniel, Y., Who needs the sub judice rule?

However, the discriminatory depiction of Indigenous women offenders in New Zealand’s press has yet to receive scholarly attention. Indigeneity and gender are both critical factors because Māori women constitute the fastest growing segment of New Zealand’s prison population, and media discourses help shape public consent to penal policies. To address this research gap, New Zealand newspaper articles featuring women offenders were collected over a 2-year period (2016–2018) and analysed for their use of neutralization and exacerbation techniques. The findings reveal that New Zealand newspapers distort our understanding of who is most affected by the criminal justice system and what crimes Pākehā1 and Māori women typically commit. Most importantly, stories about Pākehā women were more likely to use a favourable tone (56.5%), while stories about Māori women were more likely to take on an unfavourable tone (83.3%). Finally, motherhood, as an additional exacerbating factor, was mentioned nearly twice as often for Māori women. This article adds to the body of knowledge on the portrayal of Māori people in the media, linking it to public consent to governmental policies. © The Author(s) 2019.",Crime policy; gender; intersectionality; media influence; racialization; stereotyping,,,,,,,,,"Abel, S., (1997) Shaping the News: Waitangi Day on Television, , Auckland, New Zealand, Auckland University Press; Agozino, B., (2003) Counter-Colonial Criminology, , London, Pluto Press; Ayres, I., (2001) Pervasive Prejudice?

To speak in the name of the “thin blue line,” then, is to articulate the police as the primary force which secures, or makes possible, all the things said to be at the core of “human” existence: liberty, security, property, sociality, accumulation, law, civility, and even happiness. The current project is less a history of the thin blue line slogan than a more conceptually grounded sketch, and abolitionist critique, of its most basic premises: the idea at the heart of thin blue line is that the most routine mode of violent state prerogative—the police power—is imagined as always a defense of civilization, which at once means the “human species.” In other words, thin blue line, to use a formulation from Sylvia Wynter, is best understood as a defense of a particular genre of the human, or “Man,” that “overrepresents itself as if it were the human itself.” But importantly, thin blue line articulates this police project of inventing the human as always incomplete, insecure, and unstable. Of course, it must always be incomplete, because it is through its inability to fully eradicate the bestial trace that police claim a license to endless war in the name of humanity. As a discourse of ordinary emergency, thin blue line becomes an expression of what Diren Valayden outlines as “racial feralization,” or the colonial bourgeois anxiety that humanity will regress back into a violent nature. A critique of the thin blue line encourages a consideration of how fantasies and failures of becoming human animate all things police, including the racialized violence at the heart of the police project. © The Author(s) 2019.",Humanity; police power; racial feralization; racialized state violence; thin blue line,,,,,,,"I am especially indebted to Andrea Miller, David Correia, Travis Linnemann, Diren Valayden, and Bill McClanahan for reading various drafts and significantly improving my argument.

Thematic analysis of 146 articles on the assaults was conducted to identify mainstream media portrayals of emerging technologies in relation to each sex crime, and the problem of sexual assault and rape culture, more broadly. Prevailing news themes in the reporting include technology as a model witness, evidence-gatherer and mobilizer, and threat. The focus on technology in these stories, I argue, detracts from considerations of the underlying sexual violence and its causes, and contributes to the media reframing the incidents as cautionary tales about youth and social media. My analysis also suggests the discourses about digital media in the coverage reinforce existing deterministic understandings of new media platforms, and reproduce risk and responsibilization narratives pertaining to youth, sexuality and technology. © The Author(s) 2019.",News media; rape culture; risk; sexual assault; sexual violence; social media; Steubenville; technology; teens,,,,,,,,,"Albury, K., Crawford, K., Sexting, consent and young people’s ethics: beyond Megan’s Story (2012) Continuum: Journal of Media & Cultural Studies, 26 (3), pp. 463-473; Armstrong, C.L., Hull, K., Saunders, L., Victimized on plain sites (2015) Digital Journalism, 4, pp. 247-265; Barak, G., (1994) Media, Process, and the Social Construction of Crime, , New York, Garland, (ed; Barnett, B., How newspapers frame rape allegations: the Duke University case (2012) Women & Language, 35 (2), pp. 11-33; Benedict, H., (1992) Virgin or Vamp: How the Press Covers Sex Crimes, , Oxford, Oxford University Press; Bohmert, M.N., Allison, K., Ducate, C., A rape was reported”: construction of crime in a university newspaper (2018) Feminist Media Studies, , 23, August, Epub ahead of print; Bond, E., The mobile phone = bike shed?

There is a tacit scholarly consensus that news media routinely sensationalize modern serial killers as celebrity monsters. The case of Woodcock aligns with a different theoretical trajectory geared toward explaining the relative obscurity of otherwise “made for primetime” serial murder events. Examining coverage in the local and national press, the article builds on the sparse literature concerned with absences in conventional explanations for how news media participate in the cultural construction of serial murderers. It does so by gleaning insights into the ways in which Woodcock was simultaneously framed as a sadistic sex maniac responsible for killing three young children in the 1950s and a victim of social circumstance owing to his troubled upbringing. Although Woodcock killed before the rise of the serial killer claims-making industry in the 1980s, the article concludes by reflecting on the curious absence of a retroactively reconstructed modern melodramatic storyline in light of the surreal characteristics of the investigation leading up to his arrest and the circumstances that enabled him to gruesomely kill again in 1991. © The Author(s) 2019.",Child murder; media sensationalism; newsworthiness; Peter Woodcock; serial killer,,,,,,,,,"Bonn, S., (2014) Why We Love Serial Killers, , New York, Skyhorse Press; Bourrie, M., (1994) Mike Krueger’s former name is Peter Woodcock, A19. , Toronto Star, 26, January; Bourrie, M., (1997) By Reason of Insanity: The David Michael Krueger Story, , Toronto, ON, Canada, Dundurn; Bourrie, M., (2016) Peter Woodcock: Canada’s Youngest Serial Killer, , Toronto, ON, Canada, RJ Parker; Branson, A., African American serial killers: over-represented yet underacknowledged (2013) The Howard Journal of Criminal Justice, 52 (1), pp. 1-18; Chenier, E., (2008) Strangers in Our Midst, , Toronto, ON, Canada, University of Toronto Press; Donley, A., Gualtieri, M., ‘Homeless killer’: An analysis of the media’s portrayal of the victims of a serial killer (2017) Deviant Behavior, 38 (2), pp. 226-239; Fox, J.A., Levin, J., (2001) The Will to Kill, , Boston, MA, Allyn & Bacon; Greer, C., News media, victims, and crime (2017) Victims, Crime, and Society, pp. 20-49. , Davies P., Francis P., Greer C., (eds), 2nd edn., London, SAGE, In:, (eds; Haggerty, K., Modern serial killers (2009) Crime, Media, Culture, 5 (2), pp. 168-187; Hayes, D., (1992) Power and Influence, , Toronto, ON, Canada, Key Porter Books; Hendley, N., (2018) The Boy on the Bicycle, , Toronto, ON, Canada, Five Rivers Publishing; Hickey, E., (2016) Serial Murderers and Their Victims, , 7th edn., Boston, MA, Cengage Learning; Hodgkinson, S., Prins, H., Stuart-Bennett, J., Monsters, mad men.. and myths: a critical review of the serial killing literature (2017) Aggressive Behavior, 34 (2), pp. 282-289; Iyengar, S., (1991) Is Anyone Responsible?, , Chicago, IL, University of Chicago Press; Jarvis, B., Monsters Inc: serial killers and consumer culture (2007) Crime, Media, Culture, 3 (3), pp. 326-344; Jenkins, P., (1994) Using Murder, , New York, Aldine; Leyton, E., (2005) Hunting Humans, , Toronto, ON, Canada, McClelland & Stewart, 1986, (, [,]; Mellor, L., (2012) Cold North Killers, , Toronto, ON, Canada, Dundurn Press; Pearson, K., The trouble of Aileen Wuornos, feminism’s “first serial killer.

Indeed, the cameras have become an everyday piece of police ‘kit’. Despite the growing ubiquity of the body-worn video camera, understandings of the nature and value of the audiovisual footage produced by police remain inchoate. Given body-worn video camera’s promise of veracity, this article is interested in the aesthetics of the camera images and the socio-cultural construction of the cameras as tellers of truth. We treat body-worn video cameras as image-making devices linked to techniques and technologies of power, which construct and frame police encounters in specific ways, and we suggest that the aesthetics and point-of-view nature of the image contribute greatly to the truth-value that the images acquire. This article begins by providing an historical context for the use of cameras and images in policing. We then introduce our framework of visual criminology and present theories of point-of-view as a construct in the diverse areas of gaming, pornography and the visual arts, as well as in television and cinema. The article deploys the cinematic use of point-of-view to unpack the affective impact and aesthetic of the police body-worn video camera footage. We suggest that viewers of the footage are placed in the position of the corporeally absent police officer whose experience has been recorded by a viewfinderless device. This generates a vacillating interplay between subjectivity and objectivity, given that the alleged faithful recording of the event by the body-worn video camera presents a singular perspective and incomplete document that may not necessarily capture the full context of the law enforcement event. © The Author(s) 2019.",Body-worn cameras; criminal justice; digital criminology; point-of-view; police; policing; visual criminology,,,,,,,,,"Ariel, B., Farrar, W., Sutherland, A., The effect of police body-worn cameras on use of force and citizens’ complaints against the police: a randomized controlled trial (2015) Journal of Quantitative Criminology, 31 (3), pp. 509-535; Ariel, B., Sutherland, A., Henstock, D., Wearing body cameras increases assaults against officers and does not reduce police use of force: results from a global multi-site experiment (2016) European Journal of Criminology, 13 (6), pp. 744-755; Bazin, A., (1967) What is Cinema?, , Berkeley, CA; Los Angeles, CA, University of California Press; Benjamin, W., Speech to the Institute for Fascism in Paris, quoted in Caroline Brothers (1997) (1934) War and Photography: A Cultural History, p. 170. , London, Routledge, :, p; Beutin, L.P., Racialization as a way of seeing: the limits of counter-surveillance and Police reform (2017) Surveillance & Society, 15 (1), pp. 5-20; Bia, J., In this moment: embracing the individual perception of violence and sexuality in Kathryn’ Bigelow’s (2012) Strange Days.

It draws on sociology of deviance as well as Greer and McLaughlin’s model of institutional scandal and the different phases they go through. As such, the study examines how the coverage of the Mid Staffordshire hospital scandal moved through activations, reactions, amplification and accountability phases, although the progression was messy and complex. The study examines both verbal and visual elements of how TV news engaged in emotional accounts of suffering and attacks on figures of authority and public institutions. The article argues that institutional scandal and the media coverage of the NHS reflect both the politically disputed status of the NHS as well as a neoliberal drive to undermine public institutions. © The Author(s) 2017.",Institutional scandal; media and deviance; Mid Staffordshire; NHS; TV news,,,,,,,,,"Altheide, D.L., Reflections: Ethnographic content analysis (1987) Qualitative Sociology, 10 (1), pp. 65-77; Bailey, J., (2012) From Ward to Whitehall: The Disaster at Mid Staffs Hospital, , Stafford, Cure the NHS; Bentele, G., Audio-visual analysis and a grammar of presentation forms in news programs: Some mediasemiotic considerations (1985) Discourse and Communication: New Approaches to the Analysis of Mass Media Discourse and Communication, pp. 159-184. , van Dijk T., (ed), Berlin, W. de Gruyter, In:, (ed; Berg, B., Lune, H., (2012) Qualitative Research Methods for the Social Sciences, , 8th edn., Boston, MA and London, Pearson; Born, G., (2005) Uncertain Vision: Birt, Dyke and the Reinvention of the BBC, , London, Vintage; Boyce, T., (2007) Health, Risk and News: The MMR Vaccine and the Media, , Oxford and New York, Peter Lang; Braithwaite, J., The new regulatory state and the transformation of criminology (2000) The British Journal of Criminology, 40 (2), pp. 222-238; Butler, I., Drakeford, M., (2005) Scandal, Social Policy, and Social Welfare, , Bristol, Policy Press; Butler, I., Drakeford, M., Booing or cheering?

It is argued here that dystopian fiction such as The Walking Dead offers an opportunity for a popular criminology to address what criminologists have described as our discipline’s aetiological crisis in theorizing harmful and violent subjectivities. The social relations, conditions and subjectivities displayed in dystopian fiction are in fact an exacerbation or extrapolation of our present norms, values and subjectivities, rather than a departure from them, and there are numerous real-world criminological parallels depicted within The Walking Dead’s postapocalyptic world. As such, the show possesses a hard kernel of Truth that is of significant utility in progressing criminological theories of violence and harmful subjectivity. The article therefore explores the ideological function of dystopian fiction as the fetishistic disavowal of the dark underbelly of liberal capitalism; and views the show as an example of the ultra-realist concepts of special liberty, the criminal undertaker and the pseudopacification process in action. In drawing on these cutting-edge criminological theories, it is argued that we can use criminological analyses of popular culture to provide incisive insights into the real-world relationship between violence and capitalism, and its proliferation of harmful subjectivities. © The Author(s) 2017.",Cultural criminology; dystopia; popular criminology; pseudo-pacification; ultra-realism; violence,,,,,,,,,"Althusser, L., Ideology and ideological state apparatuses (1994) Mapping Ideology, pp. 100-140. , Žižek S., (ed), London, Verso, In:, (ed; Ancrum, C., Treadwell, J., Beyond ghosts, gangs and good sorts: Commercial cannabis cultivation and illicit enterprise in England’s disadvantaged inner cities (2016) Crime, Media, Culture, 13 (1), pp. 69-84; Atkinson, R., Padding the bunker: Strategies of middle-class disaffiliation and colonisation in the city (2006) Urban Studies, 43 (4), pp. 819-832; Atkinson, R., Rodgers, T., Please zones and murder boxes: Online pornography and violent video games as cultural zones of exception (2016) The British Journal of Criminology, 56 (6), pp. 1291-1307; Atkinson, R., Smith, O., An economy of false securities?

In reporting, journalists, politicians, and police commonly link meth to widespread risk, violence, criminality, and rural decay. Although the rise in meth use, addiction, and crime has been largely overstated, such imagery legitimizes an expansion of surveillance and policing to rural landscapes. In this research, I examine the way meth and meth makers are represented in case coverage of a meth lab fire sited in upstate New York. I find that reporters narrate a more general meth lab “social problem formula story” with caricature villains (meth makers), victims (community members), and heroes (law enforcement and legislators). Significantly, this model of storytelling conveys a distorted and exaggerated understanding of meth as a social problem, turning the atypical meth lab case into the “typical,” while legitimizing law and order solutions.

This analysis of Reddit forums dedicated to the 2015 Netflix documentary series Making a Murderer reveals the wide range of responses to the series and demonstrates the value of looking to user-generated content on social media platforms to understand how we think and feel about crime-related matters. I argue that Reddit users’ reactions to the series are consistent with existing research outlining the complexity of the public’s views regarding criminal justice policy and these responses are intelligible when we consider the broader socio-political context in which the series was released. Particularly important, in my view, are individuals’ affective responses – including empathy, confusion, heartbreak, anger, frustration, fear, and helplessness – and the ways these emotions are linked with beliefs about the efficacy of the criminal justice system and the purposes of punishment. Consequently, this article buttresses recent calls to consider the entire spectrum of human emotions and to investigate the ways these emotions are related to our multifaceted beliefs about crime and criminal justice. © The Author(s) 2017.",Audience reception; criminal justice attitudes; emotions; new media; public opinion,,,,,,,,,"Altheide, D.L., Schneider, C.J., (2013) Qualitative Media Analysis, , 2nd edn., Thousand Oaks, CA, Sage Publications Inc; Asimow, M., Bad lawyers in the movies (2000) Nova Law Review, 24 (2), pp. 533-591; Banks, M., Spaces of (in) security: Media and fear of crime in a local context (2005) Crime, Media, Culture, 1 (2), pp. 169-187; Barker, M., Petley, J., Introduction: From bad research to good – a guide for the perplexed (2001) Ill Effects: The Media/Violence Debate, pp. 1-26. , Barker M., Petley J., (eds), New York, Routledge, In:, (eds; Barthel, M., Stocking, G., Holcomb, J., Nearly eight-in-ten Reddit users get news on the site (2016) Pew Research Center, , http://www.journalism.org/2016/02/25/reddit-news-users-more-likely-to-be-male-young-and-digital-in-their-news-preferences/, accessed 25 September 2016; Beckett, K., Reosti, A., Knaphus, E., The end of an era?

There are significantly fewer representations of women than of men in these murals. Where women do appear, it is within a number of specific themes: as political activists, prisoners, victims or historical or mythological characters. The findings will be located within an analysis which sees the murals as a specific articulation of gender as a dimension of political mobilisation during conflict and in the period of transition from conflict. In short, the images sometimes reinforce and at other times challenge gender role expectations and norms. The extent of that reinforcement and challenge differs significantly between republican and loyalist murals. Nowhere do women receive representational equality with men, but in relation to loyalist murals, that absence comes close to being tantamount to silence. © The Author(s) 2017.",Conflict; Northern Ireland; representations of women; transition; wall murals,,,,,,,,,"Alison, M., Women as agents of political violence: Gendering security (2004) Security Dialogue, 35 (4), pp. 447-463; Ashe, F., Gendering ethno-nationalist conflict in Northern Ireland: A comparative analysis of nationalist women’s political protests (2007) Ethnic and Racial Studies, 30 (5), pp. 766-786; Bloom, M., Gill, P., Horgan, J., Tiocfaidh ár Mná: Women in the Provisional Irish Republican Army (2012) Behavioral Sciences of Terrorism and Political Aggression, 4 (1), pp. 60-76; Brown, K., Noncombatants and memorialization in post-conflict Northern Ireland (2010) Memory Ireland.

The yearlong study of officers who wore Body Worn Cameras (BWCs) in Rialto, California found that among those officers who wore the devices, use of force incidents decreased, as did complaints against the officers. These findings were extensively profiled in news media and lauded by numerous police agencies across North America and the United Kingdom. This article examines reporting of the findings of the Rialto study in news media. BWCs have received considerably more coverage in news media than in the research literature. Practically no scholarship has addressed this issue. BWCs are said to enhance police legitimacy, or the judgements of citizens concerning police conduct. A great deal of police legitimacy concerns maintaining control over their public image in media as the legitimate authority, or image work. Given the importance of police image work and the coverage of BWCs in news media, it remains vital then that we understand how BWCs are discussed in media. Some suggestions for future research are noted. © The Author(s) 2017.",Accountability; Body Worn Cameras; legitimacy; privacy; Rialto study; viral videos,,,,,,,,,"Aiello, M.F., Policing through social networking: Testing the linkage between digital and physical police practices (2017) The Police Journal Theory, Practice and Principles, pp. 1-13. , https://doi.org/10.1177/0032258X17690932; Alexander, R., Studies to focus on body cameras projects will look at impact on officers, public, privacy issues (2015) Spokesman Review, , http://www.spokesman.com/stories/2015/may/10/police-body-cameras-focus-of-two-studies/, 10, May, accessed 13 July 2017; Altheide, D.L., Schneider, C.J., (2013) Qualitative Media Analysis, , 2nd edn., Thousand Oaks, CA, SAGE; Ariel, B., Increased cooperation with the police using body worn cameras (2016) Police Quarterly, 19 (3), pp. 326-362; Ariel, B., Farrar, W.A., Sutherland, A., The effect of police body-worn cameras on use of force and citizens’ complaints against the police: A randomized controlled trial (2014) Journal of Quantitative Criminology, 31 (3), pp. 509-535; Ariel, B., Sutherland, A., Henstock, D., Wearing body cameras increases assaults against officers and does not reduce police use of force: Results from a global multi site experiment (2016) European Journal of Criminology, 13 (6), pp. 744-755. , (, a; Ariel, B., Sutherland, A., Henstock, D., Increases in police use-of-force in the presence of body worn cameras are driven by officer discretion: A protocol-based sub-group analysis (2016) Journal of Experimental Criminology, , (, b; Ariel, B., Sutherland, A., Henstock, D., Global multi-site randomised controlled trial shows that Police body-worn-cameras reduce citizen’s complaints against the police: A case of ‘contagious accountability’?’ (2016) Criminal Justice and Behavior, , (, c; Brodeur, J., Legitimizing police deviance (1981) Organizational Police Deviance, pp. 232-272. , Shearing C.D., (ed), Toronto, Butterworth and Company, In:, (ed; Broxton, T., Interian, Y., Vaver, J., Catching a viral video (2013) Journal of Intelligent Information Systems, 40. , 421–259; Bullock, K.A., (Re)presenting ‘order’ online: The construction of police presentational strategies on social media (2016) Policing and Society: An International Journal of Research and Policy, pp. 1-15. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10439463.2016.1177529; (2012) Mark Kling is newly appointed assistant professor of criminal justice at California Baptist University – Online & Professional studies, , https://www.cbuonline.edu/news?articleid=53, accessed 13 July 2017; Carroll, R., Police camera action with a lesson for UK: Rialto in California is seeing the benefit of police body cameras.

Thousands of Australians followed the crime event as it unfolded via the mainstream news and online. On Sunday 23 September, a Facebook group ‘Help Us Find Jill Meagher’ was created, accumulating 90,000 followers in just four days, while the hashtags #jillmeagher and #meagher were two of the highest trending topics on Twitter across Australia. This article focuses on the social media narrative constructions of this crime: from Jill’s initial disappearance, to the identification of her alleged killer and discovery of her body, through to the street march held in her memory on Sunday 30 September 2012. Through a qualitative analysis of a Twitter dataset comprising over 7000 original tweets, the article explores meta-narratives of sexual victimisation, ‘risk’ and ‘safety’, as well as ‘digilantism’ and activism that characterised Australian Twitter users’ responses to this violent crime. In doing so, the article reflects on collective practices of meaning-making in response to public crime events that are enabled in a digital society. © The Author(s) 2017.",Digital criminology; narrative; sexual homicide; sexual violence; social media,,,,,,"Australian Research Council, ARC: DE160100044","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.

In 2012 the perpetrator was arrested. Throughout this period as well as thereafter, the Vaatstra case was never far removed from media attention and public debate. How did this murder become such a high-profile case? In this article we employ the concept of the ‘fire object’ to examine the high-profileness of the Vaatstra case. Law and Singleton’s fire metaphor helps to attend to objects as patterns of presences and absences. In the Vaatstra case it is in particular the unknown suspect that figures as a generative absence that brings to presence different versions of the case and allows them to proliferate.

This article explicates the racial force of a specific exposé on the putatively ‘cultural’ origins of the Indo-Canadian gangster which identifies the domestic realm of the city’s South Asian populations as the principal cause of this gang violence. By tracking the trajectories of this exposé and other texts that take similar confessional forms, this article provides important insight into the differential capacity of texts to attract public attention and to persuade, by virtue of the narrative forms they assume as well as the semantic content of the knowledges they mobilize. On the one hand, this article documents the tropes of cultural inertia that characterize public knowledges of the ‘Indo-Canadian home’, which is configured as a domestic space that is culturally insulated from putatively Western norms of civility and legality. On the other hand, it explains how this exposé acquires its epistemic force from the confessional form of the knowledges it circulates, which acts as a mechanism of cultural interpellation for South Asian actors who are positioned to renounce and disavow the pathologies of Indo-Canadian culture. © The Author(s) 2016.",Criminalization; culture; family; public sphere; race,,,,,,"Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada, SSHRC","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: The research undertaken for this project was supported by a CGS Doctoral Scholarship provided by the Social Science and Humanities Research Council of Canada.",,"Axel, B.K., (2001) The Nation’s Tortured Body: Violence, Representation and the Formation of a Sikh ‘Diaspora’, , Durham, NC, Duke University Press; Bains, K., Letters (2003) Maclean’s, pp. 6-8. , 13, January; Bakshi, R., The roots of gang warfare: B.C.’s Sikhs must look hard at themselves (2002) MacLean’s, pp. 32-35. , 23, December; Ballantyne, T., (2006) Between Colonialism and Diaspora: Sikh Cultural Formations in an Imperial World, , Durham, NC, Duke University Press; Ballantyne, T., Burton, A., (2014) Empires and the Reach of the Global: 1870–1945, , Cambridge, MA, Belknap Press; Bannerji, H., (2000) Dark Side of the Nation: Essays on Multiculturalism, Nationalism, and Gender, , Toronto, Canadian Scholars Press Inc; Basran, G.S., Bolaria, B.S., (2003) The Sikhs in Canada, , New Dehli, Oxford University Press; Berlant, L., (2008) The Female Complaint: The Unfinished Business of Sentimentality in American Culture, , Durham, NC, Duke University Press; Bolan, K., (2006) Loss of Faith: How the Air India Bombers Got Away with Murder, , Toronto, McLleland and Stewart Inc, (, a; Bolan, K., Slain Surrey mom third to be targeted (2006) The Vancouver Sun, p.

For neoliberal discourse to enter and to dominate wider public ‘common sense’, vehicles of ‘populist language’ are required and the mass media has taken a central place in propagandising neoliberalism through their narration of poverty. This article focuses on so-called ‘reality TV’ and its neoliberal framing of the poor, particularly since 2007 and specifically in its generation of support for, and acquiescence in, ‘austerity’. We argue that what these programmes provide is a representation of poverty which is politically expedient but socially divisive. As criminologists, we suggest that this representation symbolises the intensification of what Cohen (2002: xxi) noted as the prominence of ‘“welfare cheats”, “social security frauds” and “dole scroungers” as fairly traditional folk devils. Further, we argue that an intensification in the denigration of the poor and the marginal in these programmes can be traced across three phases, from 2009 onwards, defined by their key features. Whilst not neatly discrete, these phases mirror the neoliberal political shift from welfare to punishment. They manufacture ‘epidemic problems’ that are seen to require urgent remediation. Yet the status and nature of these problems are defined through deception and the forms of intervention required are determined through individualised and moralised neoliberal prescription. © The Author(s) 2016.",Austerity; benefits; neoliberal; poverty; reality TV,,,,,,,,,"Adorno, T., (1967) Education after Auschwitz, , http://ada.evergreen.edu/~arunc/texts/frankfurt/auschwitz/AdornoEducation.pdf, accessed 21 June 2016; Barton, A., Davis, H., The politics of crime and the crimes of politics: Where does criminology stand in the ‘war on the poor’?

Twitter users depicted the criminal justice system (CJS) as having worked and/or failed, and these intensifying divisions were highly gendered. Members of the public pitted notions of the “rational male” against the “emotional female”, and these debates heavily supported or opposed a patriarchal legal rationality. This study sheds light on the ways in which adversarial justice systems reproduce adversarial discourses on crime, and overlook the problems entangled in misleading applications of rationality to sexual consent. The wide circulation of blame to all parties involved in this case leads us to the conclusion that the CJS, in its current punitive form, does not instil a sense of confidence in the public. With a shifted focus on the healing and dignity of everyone involved in sexual assault cases, we recommend Restorative and Transformative approaches to justice as alternative measures to respond to sexual assault. © The Author(s) 2017.",Consent; emotions; gender and masculinities; online research; sexual assault,,,,,,,,,"Ackland, R., (2013) Web Social Science, , Thousand Oaks, CA, SAGE Publications; Ahmed, S., (2014) The Cultural Politics of Emotions, , 2nd edn., Edinburgh, Edinburgh University Press; Arenas, I., The mobile politics of emotions and social movement in Oaxaca, Mexico (2015) Antipode, 47 (5), pp. 1121-1140; Bay-Cheng, L.Y., The agency line: A neoliberal metric for appraising young women’s sexuality (2015) Sex Roles, 73 (7), pp. 279-291; Bay-Cheng, L.Y., Eliseo-Arras, R.K., The making of unwanted sex: Gendered and neoliberal norms in college women’s unwanted sexual experience (2008) Journal of Sex Research, 45 (4), pp. 386-397; Bernstein, E., Militarized humanitarianism meets carceral feminism: The politics of sex, rights, and freedom in contemporary antitrafficking campaigns (2010) Signs, 36 (1), pp. 45-71; Blatchford, C., Christie Blatchford: The Ghomeshi sex-assault case started falling apart right from the start (2016) National Post, , http://news.nationalpost.com/news/canada/christie-blatchford-the-ghomeshi-sex-assault-case-started-falling-apart-right-from-the-start, February, 11; Braun, V., Tiefer, L., The ‘designer vagina’ and the pathologisation of female gential diversity: Interventions for change (2010) Radical Psychology, 8 (1). , https://researchspace.auckland.ac.nz/handle/2292/12581; Bruns, A., Moe, H., Structural layers of communication on Twitter (2014) Twitter and Society, pp. 15-28. , Weller K., Bruns A., Burgess J., (eds), New York, Peter Lang, In:, (eds; Campbell, R., Rape survivors’ experiences with the legal and medical systems: Do rape victim advocates make a difference?

Drawing from literatures about celebrities and politics and norm entrepreneurship, and using qualitative-interpretive methods of data collection and analysis, I show how the K&M Campaign provides an early, high-profile example of this norm entrepreneurship that demonstrates why and how celebrities communicate norms to the broader public. To illustrate, I show how changing political-economic conditions have facilitated celebrities’ ascendance in the polity, and I argue that Kutcher and Moore have emerged under these conditions to actively oppose human trafficking. Using their considerable resources, they have promoted an “individual responsibility” norm that instructs the public to avoid coercive sexual and labor activities and trafficking situations. I then argue further that the K&M Campaign provides broader lessons about norms’ fluidity: even when they are seemingly incontrovertible and their entrepreneurial proponents (celebrities) have extensive resources, norms may be contradicted and contentious nonetheless. In this case, by promoting an individual responsibility norm, Kutcher and Moore inadvertently conveyed retrograde gender norms and minimized the importance of broader structural solutions to human trafficking. © The Author(s) 2017.",celebrities;

Accounts of police misconduct captured by new communication and information technologies have played a central role in elevating this issue. On the continental US, the Black Lives Matter movement has driven these events, lodging the political debate in the larger context of racial inequality. In Hawaii, a parallel but distinctive series of events has occurred. A push for greater police accountability has emerged, but it has been more closely associated with gender relations than race relations and has involved women in political office rather than street protests. The Hawaii case also provides some generalizable lessons, particularly regarding the context-specific roles that gender and race relations play, and the potential for video evidence in promoting police reform. © The Author(s) 2016.",Police reform; politics; surveillance,,,,,,,,,"Allan, S., (2006) Online News: Journalism and the Internet, , 1st edn, Open University Press; Appadurai, A., Disjuncture and difference in the global cultural economy (1990) Public Culture, 2 (2), pp. 282-295; Aviram, H., (2015) Cheap on Crime: Recession-Era Politics and the Transformation of American Punishment, , Oakland, CA, University of California Press; Best, J., (1990) Threatened Children: Rhetoric and Concern about Child-Victims, , Chicago, IL, University of Chicago Press; Brown, G.R., The blue line on thin ice: Police use of force modifications in the era of cameraphones and YouTube (2016) British Journal of Criminology, 56 (2), pp. 293-312; Brown, M., Visual criminology and carceral studies: Counter-images in the carceral age (2014) Theoretical Criminology, 18 (2), pp. 176-197; (2011) 2010 Annual Report, , http://www.policemisconduct.net/statistics/2010-annual-report/, Washington, DC, Cato Institute, accessed 22 June 2016, National Police Misconduct Reporting Project; Chagnon, N., Chesney-Lind, M., ‘Someone’s been in the house:’ a tale of burglary and trial by media (2015) Crime, Media, Culture, 11 (1), pp. 41-60; Chesney-Lind, M., Lind, I.Y., Visitors as victims crimes against tourists in Hawaii (1986) Annals of Tourism Research, 13 (2), pp. 167-191; Chesney-Lind, M., (2014) The history of the women’s movement in Hawaii, , Diamond Head Lighthouse Coast Guard Station, HI, Keynote address; Cook, T., The functions of the press in a democracy (2005) The Press, Institutions of American Democracy, pp. 115-119. , Overholser G., Jameison K.H., (eds), New York, Oxford University Press, In:, (eds; Crenshaw, K.W., Richie, A.J., (2015) Say Her Name: Resisting Police Brutality Against Black Women: July 2015 Update, , New York, African American Policy Forum; Culp, M.H., Chief’s counsel: Officer-involved orders for protection: A management challenge (2000) Police Chief, 67 (3), pp. 10-11; Domonoske, C., Mired in sex scandal, Oakland Police Department loses 3 chiefs in 9 days (2016) NPR.org, , http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/06/20/482808353/mired-in-sex-scandal-oakland-police-department-loses-3-chiefs-in-9-days, accessed 22 June 2016; Dooley, J., (2015) Sunny Skies, Shady Characters: Cops, Killers, and Corruption in the Aloha State, , Honolulu, HI, University of Hawaii Press; Eagle, N., Hawaii superferry talks involve bigger, slower boat with gambling (2014) Civil Beat News, , http://www.civilbeat.com/2014/10/hawaii-superferry-talks-involve-bigger-slower-boat-with-gambling/, accessed 28 January 2016; Entman, R.M., Rojecki, A., (2001) The Black Image in the White Mind: Media and Race in America, , Chicago, IL, University of Chicago Press; (2014) Legislative Hearing on Domestic Violence, , http://olelo.granicus.com/MediaPlayer.php?view_id=25&clip_id=43658, Honolulu, HI, Olelo; Foucault, M., Truth and power (1980) Power/knowledge: Selected Interviews and Other Writings 1972–1977, pp. 109-133. , Gordon C., (ed), New York, Pantheon, In:, (ed; Foucault, M., (1995) Discipline & Punish: The Birth of the Prison, , New York, Vintage; Franklin, C.A., Male peer support and the police culture (2007) Women & Criminal Justice, 16 (3), pp. 1-25; Gitlin, T., (2007) Media Unlimited, Revised Edition: How the Torrent of Images and Sounds Overwhelms Our Lives, , New York, Picador; Green, D.A., Penal optimism and second chances: The legacies of American Protestantism and the prospects for penal reform (2013) Punishment & Society, 15 (2), pp. 123-146; Greer, C., McLaughlin, E., ‘Trial by media’: Policing, the 24–7 news mediasphere and the ‘politics of outrage’ (2011) Theoretical Criminology, 15 (1), pp. 23-46; Greer, C., McLaughlin, E., Media justice: Madeleine McCann, intermediatization and ‘trial by media’ in the British press (2012) Theoretical Criminology, 16 (4), pp. 395-416; Greer, C., McLaughlin, E., The Sir Jimmy Savile scandal: Child sexual abuse and institutional denial at the BBC (2013) Crime Media Culture, 9 (3), pp. 243-263; Greer, C., Reiner, R., Mediated mayhem: Media, crime, criminal justice (2012) Oxford Handbook of Criminology, pp. 245-278. , Maguire M., Morgan R., Reiner R., (eds), Oxford University Press, In:, (eds; Grube, N., HPD: Nearly $6 million in legal settlements in 11 years (2014) Civil Beat News, , http://www.civilbeat.com/2014/06/hpd-nearly-6-million-legal-settlements-11-years/, accessed 1 March 2016; Grube, N., In Hawaii, police transparency will have to wait (2015) Civil Beat News, , http://www.civilbeat.com/2015/02/in-hawaii-police-transparency-will-have-to-wait/, accessed 1 February 2016; Grube, N., Why did the state hire a cop who’d been fired by HPD?

A recent trend of corporate crime movies suggests that film can compellingly critique economic crime and unethical business cultures. This article studies how law enforcement agencies, particularly competition authorities, have connected with this trend by using film in their communicative strategy. This article introduces the emerging genre of anti-cartel enforcement thrillers: regulator-produced realistic docudramas in which fictional cartels are exposed and punished. These films’ narratives about cartel enforcement are reconstructed by studying how the films portray cartels, perpetrators and their motives, and the regulator. An analysis of four films produced in four jurisdictions demonstrates that the films deter only to the extent that the local legal and political-economic context allows: the British film reflects that country’s neoliberal ‘pro-business’ climate, while the Swedish film depicts businesses as socially responsible and the Dutch film is pragmatic rather than moralistic. Only the Australian film is explicitly punitive in its narrative as well as its imaginary, and exemplifies the persuasive potential of film in enforcement. © The Author(s) 2017.",Cartel enforcement; crime film; media representations of crime; white collar crime,,,,,,,,,"Almond, P., The dangers of hanging baskets: ‘Regulatory myths’ and media representations of health and safety regulation (2009) Journal of Law and Society, 36 (3), pp. 352-375; Beaton-Wells, C., Parker, C., Education before enforcement?

Despite this ubiquity, little research has been conducted examining representations of prisons and punishment within one of the most popular forms of contemporary entertainment media: video games. Drawing from cultural criminology and Gothic criminology, the current study examines punitive and carceral elements in the horror video game franchise of Silent Hill. Eight games within the series are analyzed through a combination of ethnographic content analysis and autoethnography to reveal two dominant themes evident throughout the series: retribution and confinement. As argued in this study, Silent Hill—like many horror productions—revels in ambiguity and expresses cultural anxieties stemming from the paradoxical vertiginous sentiments of insecurity amidst increasing securitization and prisonization of society and everyday life. Survival horror, including Silent Hill, is a product of both Japanese and American cultural formations. This analysis therefore argues that Silent Hill reveals an American-Japanese public imagination that clamors for respite from insecurity while also becoming horrified by the carceral apparatus it created. © The Author(s) 2017.",Content analysis; prisons; punishment; Silent Hill; video games,,,,,,,,,"Altheide, D.L., Ethnographic content analysis (1987) Qualitative Sociology, 10 (1), pp. 65-77; Barker, C., Foreword: A little light in the darkness (2009) Horror Video Games, pp. 1-2. , Perron B., (ed), Jefferson, NC, McFarland & Company, Inc., In:, (ed; Botsman, D.V., (2005) Punishment and Power in the Making of Modern Japan, , Princeton, NJ, Princeton University Press; Browning, J., Picart, C.J., (2009) Draculas, Vampires, and Other Undead Forms, , Lanham, MD, Scarecrow Press; Carr, D., Play dead (2003) Game Studies, 3 (1). , http://www.gamestudies.org/0301/carr/, accessed 10 September 2014; Carroll, N., (1990) The Philosophy of Horror or Paradoxes of the Heart, , New York, Routledge; Cohen, J.J., Monster culture (seven theses) (1996) Monster Theory, pp. 3-25. , Cohen J.J., (ed), Minneapolis, MN, University of Minnesota Press, In:, (ed; Downing, S., Levan, K., Pains of imprisonment in a “lock ‘em up” video game (2016) Contemporary Justice Review, 19 (1), pp. 142-162; Durkheim, E., (2006) On Suicide, , New York, Penguin Classics, 1897, (, [,]; Enck, S.M., Morrissey, M.E., If Orange is the New Black, I must be color blind (2015) Critical Studies in Media Communication, 32 (5), pp. 303-317; Ferrell, J., Cultural criminology and the politics of meaning (2013) Critical Criminology, 21 (3), pp. 257-271; Ferrell, J., Hayward, K., Young, J., (2015) Cultural Criminology, , 2nd edn., Thousand Oaks, CA, SAGE; Fiddler, M., Projecting the prison (2007) Crime Media Culture, 3 (2), pp. 192-206; Fiddler, M., Playing Funny Games in The Last House on the Left (2013) Crime Media Culture, 9 (3), pp. 281-299; Foucault, M., (1977) Discipline and Punish, , New York, Vintage; Furlong, A., The Japanese hikikomori phenomenon (2008) The Sociological Review, 56 (2), pp. 309-325; Garland, D., (2001) The Culture of Control, , Chicago, IL, The University of Chicago Press; Glaser, B.G., Strauss, A.L., (1967) The Discovery of Grounded Theory, , Chicago, IL, Aldine Publishing Company; Hamai, K., Ellis, T., Crime and criminal justice in modern Japan (2006) International Journal of the Sociology of Law, 34, pp. 157-178; Harper, J., J-horror/Japanese horror (2010) Directory of World Cinema: Japan, pp. 176-181. , Berra J., (ed), Chicago, IL, Intellect/The University of Chicago Press, In:, (ed; Hurley, K., (1996) The Gothic Body, , Cambridge, MA, Cambridge University Press; Ingebretsen, E.J., (2001) At Stake, , Chicago, IL, University of Chicago Press; Jarvis, B., Monsters Inc (2007) Crime Media Culture, 3 (3), pp. 326-344; Jewkes, Y., Autoethnography and emotion as intellectual resources (2011) Qualitative Inquiry, 18 (1), pp. 63-75; Kaeble, D., Glaze, L., Tsoutis, A., (2015) Correctional populations in the United States, 2014, , Washington, DC, Bureau of Justice Statistics,.

Using Gamergate as an example, this article argues that explanations of online abuse that focus on its cultural or technological dimensions fail to capture the mediating role of online platforms in facilitating and rationalizing harassment and reputational damage. The concept of technological rationality pulls into focus the shared logics that shape platform design and administration as well as practices of online abuse. Proposed solutions to online abuse that fail to address technological rationality will ultimately leave in place the sociotechnical arrangements that make such abuse possible and impactful. © The Author(s) 2017.",Abuse; critical theory; gender; masculinity; technology,,,,,,,,,"Abbate, J., (2012) Recoding Gender: Women’s Changing Participation in Computing, , Cambridge, MA and London, MIT Press; Alberty, E., Feminist media critic calls for boycott of Utah campuses (2014) Salk Lake Tribune, , http://www.sltrib.com/sltrib/news/58529300–58529378/sarkeesian-threats-usu-austin.html.csp, 17, October, accessed 6 October 2016; Allen, J., How crowdfunding helps haters profit from harassment (2015) Boing Boing, , http://boingboing.net/2015/2001/2014/how-crowdfunding-helps-haters.html, 14, January, accessed 6 October 2016; Auerbach, D., Anonymity as culture: Treatise (2012) Triple Canopy, 15. , https://www.canopycanopycanopy.com/contents/anonymity_as_culture__treatise, accessed 6 October 2016; Baio, A., 72 hours of #Gamergate: Digging through 316,669 tweets from three days of Twitter’s two month old trainwreck (2014) Medium, , https://medium.com/message/72-hours-of-gamergate-e00513f7cf5d#.i9bjo9r34, 28, October, accessed 6 October 2016; Banyard, V.L., Moynihan, M.M., Plante, E.G., Sexual violence prevention through bystander education: An experimental evaluation (2007) Journal of Community Psychology, 35, pp. 463-481; Bell, D., Geek myths: Technologies, masculinities, globalizations (2013) Rethinking Transnational Men: Beyond, Between and Within Nations, pp. 76-90. , Hearn J., Blagojević M., Harriso K., (eds), London and New York, Routledge, In:, (eds; Braithwaite, A., It’s about ethics in games journalism?

Contrary to such symbolizing, and drawing on Hayward and Schuilenburg’s (2014) criteria for resistance, this article examines the longevity and endurance of Pashtun poetry as a vehicle of resistance for women and girls in their fight against state-sanctioned patriarchal oppression. Not only does this undermine the broader narrative of helplessness propagated by the West, but it illuminates the agency, resilience, and bravery of women who challenge the status quo and achieve greater participation in public and political life. © The Author(s) 2016.",Art; gender; patriarchy; poetry; resistance; women,,,,,,"Eastern Kentucky University, EKU","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was supported by Eastern Kentucky University Fellow Program.",,"Abirafeh, L., (2009) Gender and International Aid in Afghanistan: The Politics and Effects of Intervention, , London, McFarlane & Company, Inc., Publishers; Abu-Lughod, L., (1986) Veiled Sentiments: Honor and Poetry in Bedouin Society, , Oakland, CA, University of California Press; Alexander, J., Cultural pragmatics: Social performance between ritual and strategy (2006) Social Performance: Symbolic Action, Cultural Pragmatics, and Ritual, pp. 29-90. , Alexander J.C., Giesen B., Mast J.L., (eds), New York, NY, Cambridge University Press, In:, (eds; (1999) Amnesty International Report 1999 – Afghanistan, , http://www.refworld.org/docid/3ae6aa0970.html, 1, January, accessed 30 April 2016; Andrews, K.T., Biggs, M., The dynamics of protest diffusion: Movement organizations, social networks, and news media in the 1960 sit-ins (2006) American Sociological Review, 71 (5), pp. 752-777; Aptheker, H., (1969) American Negro Slave Revolts, , New York, NY, International Publishers; Baker, A., (1998) Voices of Resistance: Oral Histories of Moroccan Women, , Albany, NY, State University of New York Press; Bennett, A., Peterson, R.A., (2004) Music Scenes: Local, Translocal and Virtual, , Nashville, TN, Vanderbilt University Press; Bernard, C., Jones, S.G., Oliker, O., (2008) Women and Nation-building, , Santa Monica, CA, RAND Corporation; Bibby, M., (1996) Hearts and Minds: Bodies, Poetry and Resistance in the Vietnam Era, , New Brunswick, NJ, Rutgers University Press; Boal, A., (1979) Theater of the Oppressed, , London, Pluto Press; Cestari, E., Landay poetry in Afghanistan (2014) Mufta, , http://muftah.org/pashtun-folklore-case-landay/#.VyI8lPkrLrc, 6, August, accessed 11 March 2016; Cheliotis, L.K., (2012) The Arts of Imprisonment: Control, Resistance and Empowerment, , Farnham, Ashgate Publishing Limited, (ed; Cheliotis, L.K., Decorative justice: Deconstructing the relationship between arts and imprisonment (2014) International Journal for Crime, Justice and Social Democracy, 3 (1), pp. 16-34; Collins, V.E., (2015) State Crime, Women and Gender, , New York, NY, Routledge; Eyerman, R., Performing opposition or, how social movements move (2006) Social Performance: Symbolic Action, Cultural Pragmatics, and Ritual, pp. 193-217. , Alexander J.C., Giesen B., Mast J.L., (eds), Cambridge, Cambridge University Press, In:, (eds; Ferrell, J., (1993) Crimes of Style: Urban Graffiti and the Politics of Criminality, , New York, NY, Garland; Finley, L.L., The lyrics of Rage Against The Machine: A study in radical criminology (2002) Journal of Criminal Justice and Popular Culture, 9 (3), pp. 150-166; Fraser, A.S., Becoming human: The origins and development of women’s human rights (1999) Human Rights Quarterly, 21 (4), pp. 853-906; Friedrichs, D.O., On resisting state crime: Conceptual and contextual issues (2009) Social Justice, 36 (3), pp. 4-27; Friedrichs, D.O., Resisting state crime as a criminological project (2013) State Crime and Resistance, pp. 14-27. , Stanley E., McCulloch J., (eds), New York, NY, Routledge, In:, (eds; Giles, W., Hyndman, J., Introduction: Gender and conflict in a global context (2004) Sites of Violence: Gender and Conflict Zones, pp. 1-23. , Giles W., Hyndman J., (eds), Berkeley, CA, University of California Press, In:, (eds; Green, P., Ward, T., Civil society, resistance and state criminality (2013) State Crime and Resistance, pp. 28-41. , Stanley E., McCulloch J., (eds), New York, NY, Routledge, In:, (eds; Grewcock, M., The great escape: Refugees, detention and resistance (2013) State Crime and Resistance, pp. 54-67. , Stanley E., McCulloch J., (eds), New York, NY, Routledge, In:, (eds; Griswold, E., Why Afghan women risk death to write poetry (2012) New York Times Magazine, , www.nytimes.com/2012/04/29/magazine/why-afghan-women-risk-death-to-write-poetry.html?pagewanted=all&_r=1&, 27, April, accessed 12 March 2016; Griswold, E., (2014) I Am Beggar of the World: Landays From Contemporary Afghanistan, , New York, NY, Farrar, Straus and Giroux; Gurevitch, Z., The tongue’s break dance: Theory, poetry, and the critical body (1999) The Sociological Quarterly, 40 (3), pp. 525-540; Hawkesworth, M.E., War as a mode of reproduction: Feminist analytics (2008) War and Terror: Feminist Perspectives, pp. 1-34. , Alexander K., Hawkesworth M.E., (eds), Chicago, IL, University of Chicago Press, In:, (eds; Hayward, K.J., Schuilenburg, M., To resist = to create?

It is argued here that – as a cultural text – Breaking Bad is emblematic of an agenda for change surrounding criminological theories of peoples’ propensity to do harm to one another. To exemplify this, the show’s central (male) protagonist is revealed to undergo a complete biosocial transformation into a violent offender and, as such, to demonstrate the need for criminological theory to recognise and further reflect upon this process. However, at the same time, the (re)presented inability of the show’s female characters to do the same is indicative of a number of gender-related questions that progressive criminological theories of violence need to answer. In considering these two fields in tandem, the show’s criminological significance is established; it is symbolic of the need for criminology to afford greater recognition to the nuanced intersections of both biological and sociological factors in the genesis and evolution of violent human subjectivities. © The Author(s) 2017.",Biology; Breaking Bad; gender; interpersonal violence; popular criminology; transcendental materialism,,,,,,,,,"Athens, L.H., (1992) The Creation of Violent Dangerous Criminals, , Chicago, IL, University of Illinois Press; Atkinson, R., Rodgers, T., Pleasure zones and murder boxes: Online pornography and violent video games as cultural zones of exception (2016) British Journal of Criminology, 56 (6), pp. 1291-1307; Badiou, A., (2005) Being and Event, , London, Bloomsbury, Translated by; Badiou, A., (2009) Theory of the Subject, , London, Continuum, Translated by; Braidotti, R., (2002) Metamorphoses: Towards a Materialist Theory of Becoming, , Cambridge, Polity; Brown, M., Rafter, N., Genocide films, public criminology, collective memory (2013) British Journal of Criminology, 53 (6), pp. 1017-1032; Burgess, R.L., Akers, R.L., A differential association-reinforcement theory of criminal behaviour (1966) Social Problems, 14 (2), pp. 128-147; Cacioppo, J.T., Berntson, G.G., (2004) Essays in Social Neuroscience, , Cambridge, MA, MIT Press, (eds; Carrabine, E., (2008) Crime, Culture and the Media, , Cambridge, Polity; Carrabine, E., Just images: Aesthetics, ethics and visual criminology (2012) British Journal of Criminology, 52 (3), pp. 463-489; Chung, E., Cromby, J., Papadopoulos, D., Social epigenetics: A science of social science?

Today, one of the key vehicles accelerating this turn are Facebook fight pages: user-generated content aggregation pages that publicly host footage of street fights, and other forms of bare-knuckle violence on the popular social networking site. Drawing on observational data collected from five popular fight pages, and survey data from 205 fight page users, this article explores the different forms of bare-knuckle violence hosted on these online domains and their users’ motivations for viewing it. Through doing so, it examines eleven distinct modes of spectating bare-knuckle violence on fight pages: entertainment, consumptive deviance, righteous justice, amusement, self-affirmation, nostalgia, boredom alleviation, intrigue, self-defence training and risk awareness. Additionally, I argue that to understand these modes of spectating bare-knuckle violence, we have to address the codes of masculinity that underlie not only much of the violence hosted on fight pages, but also spectators’ readings of these events. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.",Antisocial media; Facebook; fight videos; masculinity; modes of spectatorship; online violence; reception studies,,,,,,,"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This research was conducted in the scope of a PhD project supported by an Australian Postgraduate Award scholarship.",,"Anderson, C.A., Berkowitz, L., Donnerstein, E., The influence of media violence on youth (2003) Psychological Science in the Public Interest, 4 (3), pp. 81-110; Bennett, C., Facebook KO fails to keep Perth ‘Fight Club’ pages down (2014) WAtoday, , http://www.watoday.com.au/wa-news/facebook-ko-fails-to-keep-perth-fight-club-pages-down-20141126–11u88b.html, 26, November; Blackshaw, T., Crabbe, T., (2004) New Perspectives on Sport and ‘Deviance’: Consumption, Performativity and Social Control, , London, Routledge; Bowman, P., (2015) Martial Arts Studies: Disrupting Disciplinary Boundaries, , London, Rowman & Littlefield; Brent, J.J., Kraska, P.B., Fighting is the most real and honest thing (2013) British Journal of Criminology, 53 (3), pp. 357-377; Brown, M., Visual criminology and carceral studies: Counter-images in the carceral age (2014) Theoretical Criminology, 18 (2), pp. 176-197; Bushman, B.J., Stack, A.D., Forbidden fruit versus tainted fruit: Effects of warning labels on attraction to television violence (1996) Journal of Experimental Psychology: Applied, 2 (3), pp. 207-226; Carrabine, E., Just images: Aesthetics, ethics and visual criminology (2012) British Journal of Criminology, 52 (3), pp. 463-489; Dean, S., Pictured: The shocking real-life fight club where videos of bare-knuckle brawls are shared by thousands on Facebook (2015) Daily Mail Australia, , http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2930397/Real-life-fight-club-takes-NT-members-start-posting-bare-knuckle-brawls-Facebook.html, 29, January; Entwistle, P., Facebook fight page numbers growing (2014) 6PR882 News Talk, , http://www.6pr.com.au/news/facebook-fight-page-numbers-growing-20141126–11u65z.html, 26, November; Fafinski, S., In the back of the net: Football hooliganism and the Internet (2006) Crime Online, pp. 109-127. , Jewkes Y., (ed), London, Willan,.

For cold case homicide survivors, these relationships are likely to develop into long-term, persistent interactions. Interviews from 24 cold case homicide survivors in the United States reveal that media professionals are often the source of additional trauma, and yet, most survivors expressed a need for continued communication and continued coverage of their case. Utilizing social constructivist grounded theory for data collection and analysis, common themes emerging from the survivors’ stories include inadequate coverage of the case, inaccurate portrayal of victim or information, negative reactions to the media, and positive experiences and desire for long-term coverage. Implications and recommendations for survivors and media professionals are detailed within. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.",Cold case; grief; homicide survivors; media; victimology,,,,,,,,,"Ahern, J., Galea, S., Resnick, H., Television images and psychological symptoms after the September 11 terrorist attacks (2002) Psychiatry, 65 (4), pp. 289-300; Anastasio, P.A., Costa, D.M., Twice hurt: How newspaper coverage may reduce empathy and engender blame for female victims of crime (2004) Sex Roles, 51 (9-10), pp. 535-542; Armour, M.P., Experiences of covictims of homicide: Implications for research and practice (2002) Trauma, Violence, & Abuse, 3, pp. 109-124; Armour, M.P., Meaning making in the aftermath of homicide (2003) Death Studies, 27 (6), pp. 519-540; Blau, R., (1991) The Cop Shop: True Crime on the Streets of Chicago, , Reading, MA, Addison-Wesley; Breslin, J.J., (2003) Crime victims and the media: Ethical and legal perspectives, , University of Minnesota, USA,.

Drawing upon a review of existing literature and analysis of news media representations, we argue that websleuthing is much more diverse than previously thought. Encompassing a wide range of motives, manifestations, activities, networked spaces and cases, websleuthing has a variety of impacts upon victims, secondary victims, suspects, criminal justice organisations and websleuths themselves. We conclude that websleuthing is the embodiment of true crime infotainment in a ‘wound culture’ (Seltzer, 2007, 2008) and as such, is deserving of more criminological scrutiny than has been the case to date. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.",Amateur sleuths; digital vigilantism; infotainment; networked media; websleuthing,,,,,,,,,"Alleyne, R., Computer expert turns online sleuth to track down stolen computers (2011) The Telegraph, , 16, November; Altheide, D.L., Reflections: Ethnographic content analysis (1987) Qualitative Sociology, 10 (1), pp. 65-77. , http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/8894121/Computer-expert-turns-online-sleuth-to-track-down-stolen-computers.html; Laird solves china crisis: Thief makes a net loss (2004) The Express, , 20, September; Amateur sleuth gets stolen bike back (2014) The Herald, , 26, July; Baym, N.K., (2015) Personal Connections in the Digital Age, , 2nd edn., Cambridge, Polity; Bolter, J.D., Grusin, R., (1999) Remediation: Understanding New Media, , Cambridge, MA, MIT Press; Bradbury, D., Web detectives get little sleep as they keep watch over you (2007) Australian Financial Review, , 16, March; Brown, S., Media/crime/millennium: Where are we now?

Based on testimony from interviews with people who took part in the 2011 England riots, it explores the curiosity which drew many onto the streets, the excitement and fear involved in such quickly unfolding and unpredictable events, the impunity that many felt being part of such large crowds, together with the sense of ‘empowerment’ many experienced as a consequence of their involvement. The article suggests that a number of concepts regularly deployed within cultural criminology – most obviously ‘carnival’ and ‘edgework’ – are useful in understanding elements of the emotional world of the riot. More fundamentally, however, it is argued that what the accounts describe more than anything else is a pervading sense of ‘alienation’ among many of those involved in the disorder. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.",Alienation; carnival; disorder; edgework; emotions; riots,,,,,,"Joseph Rowntree Foundation, JRF

This study explores the nature of public perceptions of a group of offenders on which the media often focus—female teachers who assault adolescent male students—by examining reader comments posted on five Huffington Post articles published from November 2010 to November 2013. Using a thematic coding methodology to analyze over 900 online comments, we found that most comments recognize a current double standard in the sentencing process for female teacher sex offenders compared to their male counterparts. Comments also rely on traditional sexual scripts and/or gender role expectations to either acknowledge or deny a victim’s presence. Contrary to existing research that examined public perceptions and found that more punitive attitudes were expressed toward male sex offenders, these results suggest that the public believes in equality in sentencing for all sex offenders, regardless of gender. These results also confirm prior studies that find that the public perceives adolescent male victims of rape by older women “lucky.”. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.",Equality with a vengeance; female sex offenders; male victims; media framing; online commenting; rape myths,,,,,,,,,"Anderson, I., Swainson, V., Perceived motivation for rape: Gender differences in beliefs about female and male rape (2001) Current Research in Social Psychology, 6 (8), pp. 107-123; Berrington, E., Honkatukia, P., An evil monster and a poor thing: Female violence in the media (2002) Journal of Scandinavian Studies in Criminology and Crime Prevention, 3 (1), pp. 50-72; Brennan, P.K., Vandenberg, A.L., Depictions of female offenders in front-page newspaper stories: The importance of race/ethnicity (2009) International Journal of Social Inquiry, 2 (2), pp. 141-175; Broussard, S., Wagner, W.G., Kazelskis, R., Undergraduate students’ perceptions of child sexual abuse: The impact of victim sex, perpetrator sex, respondent sex, and victim response (1991) Journal of Family Violence, 6 (3), pp. 267-278; Byers, S.E., How well does the traditional sexual script explain sexual coercion?

The impact of these photographs also shows that depictions of deaths as a result of border crossings are relatively rare in the media; analyses of such representations and their potential impact on policy are also neglected in the literature. This article offers a commentary on the key themes linked to visual representations of refugee deaths at border crossings by considering three recent examples, and argues for further interdisciplinary discussions on such images. It focuses on two points: that depicting refugees alone has a greater impact on viewers and is more likely to trigger sympathy or outrage; concurrently, that anonymity can reduce viewers’ ability to connect with the tragedy. This discussion adds to the body of literature on the links between media representations and policymaking, and on the mediation of human vulnerability through visual means. The themes outlined here have much currency in contemporary discussions on refugee deaths at border crossings. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.",Asylum seekers; border crossings; deaths; refugees; visual representations,,,,,,,,,"(2015) At least 26 refugees, including 17 children, drown off Greece, , www.america.aljazeera.com/articles/2015/10/30/refugees-drown-off-greece.html, Al Jazeera accessed 23 November 2015; Anderson, S., (2016) More than 180 Syrian and Iraqi refugees resettled in Australia, , http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016–04–06/more-than-180-refugees-resetttled-in-australia-government-says/7302958, accessed 4 September 2016; Androff, D.K., Tavassoli, K.Y., Deaths in the desert: the human rights crisis on the U.S.-Mexico border (2012) Social Work, 57 (2), pp. 165-173; Banks, J., Unmasking deviance: The visual construction of asylum seekers and refugees in English national newspapers (2012) Critical Criminology, 20 (3), pp. 293-310; Bleiker, R., Campbell, D., Hutchison, E., The visual dehumanisation of refugees (2013) Australian Journal of Political Science, 48 (4), pp. 398-416; (2016) Australian Border Deaths Database, , http://artsonline.monash.edu.au/thebordercrossingobservatory/publications/australian-border-deaths-database, accessed 20 April 2016; Butler, J., Photography, war, outrage (2005) Modern Language Association, 120 (3), pp. 822-827; Clay, C., Mirelis, T., Staring death in the face during times of war: When ethics, law and self-censorship in the news media hide the morbidity of authenticity (2012) Notre Dame Journal of Law, Ethics and Public Policy, 25 (1), pp. 87-121; Chambers, P., Shipwreck with spectator: Snapshots of border security in Australia (2014) Global Change, Peace & Security, 26 (1), pp. 97-112; Chouliaraki, L., (2006) The Spectatorship of Suffering, , London, Sage; Chouliaraki, L., The humanity of war: Iconic photojournalism of the battlefield, 1914–2012 (2013) Visual Communication, 12 (3), pp. 315-340; Collier, M., Approaches to analysis in visual anthropology (2004) The Handbook of Visual Analysis, pp. 35-61. , Van-Leeuwen T., Jewitt C., (eds), London, SAGE Publications,.

The 18–24 age demographic are at increased risk of experiencing sex offences, with over half of these crimes involving alcohol consumption. The interactions which culminate in alcohol-involved rape often commence in night-time venues, making intuitive sense for prevention campaigns to be based within licensed establishments. The Night Time Economy, however, comprises venues where people go to drink, have fun, take ‘time out’ and which are characterised and criticised for their promotion of sexism. This article therefore asks: how useful are licensed spaces in promoting rape prevention discourses amongst young men? To this end, the article analyses 41 students’ discussions (across six focus groups) regarding a rape prevention campaign that ran in one English city and that directed its prevention advice at males. In doing so, we argue that environments which incite narratives of loss of control and hypersexuality compromise the ability to counter sexual offending. We also argue that the presence of sexually violent advertising within licenced spaces undermines considerably the call to end gendered violence. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.",Alcohol; gender; Night Time Economy; prevention; rape,,,,,,"Liverpool John Moores University, LJMU","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was supported by Liverpool City Council and Liverpool John Moores University.",,"Abbey, A., Zawacki, T., Buck, P.O., Sexual assault and alcohol consumption: What do we know about their relationship and what types of research are still needed?

The first section establishes the need for documentary filmmaking in criminology and outlines methodological opportunities. The second section examines theoretically the aesthetics and substance of documentary criminology. The third section takes the film Girl Model (Redmon and Sabin, 2011) as a case study to demonstrate how documentary criminology embedded in lived experience (in this case, the experience of scouts that recruit young Russian girls, purportedly for the modelling industry) can depict sensuous immediacy. The final section contrasts the aesthetic and ethical consequences of documentary criminology within Carrabine’s (2012, 2014) concept of ‘just’ images to a documentary filmmaking approach that remains interpretively open-ended.

It asks: How does police image work engage with or respond to ongoing histories of state violence and queer resistance? And why does this matter? To explore these questions, the article provides a case study of the Victorian Pride March in 2002. It analyzes textual representations of Chief Commissioner Christine Nixon’s participation in the parade to show how histories of homophobic police violence can be used strategically to fortify a positive police image among LGBT people and the wider community. Police image work carried out at Pride March becomes a means of legitimizing past policing practices with the aim of overcoming poor and antagonistic LGBT-police relations. The visibility of police at Pride March, this analysis suggests, contributes to the normalization of queerness as a site to be continually policed and regulated. Image work here also buttresses police reputation against the negative press associated with incidents of police brutality. This investigation contributes to the literature on police communications and impression management by demonstrating how police can mobilize negative aspects of their organizational history as an important part of police image work in the present. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.",Affect; gay pride; legitimacy; police image; queer history,,,,,,"Monash University, MU","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was supported by a Postgraduate Publishing Award from Monash University.",,"Agathangelou, A.M., Bassichis, D.M., Spira, T.L., Intimate investments: Homonormativity, global lockdown, and the seductions of empire (2008) Radical History Review, 100, pp. 120-143; Ahmed, S., (2004) The Cultural Politics of Emotion, , London, Routledge; Ahmed, S., (2010) The Promise of Happiness, , Durham, NC, Duke University Press; Akersten, M., Mardi Gras welcomes new police accord (2014) Same Same; (2014) 2015 Mardi Gras set to GLLO with police pride, , http://australianpridenetwork.com.au/2015-mardi-gras-set-to-gllo-with-police-pride/, :; Barker, R.S., (2001) Legitimating Identities:The Self-presentations of Rulers and Subjects, , Cambridge, Cambridge University Press; Bolt, A., Our cops go girlie (2006) Herald Sun, p. 21. , p; Bottoms, A., Tankebe, J., Beyond procedural justice: A dialogic approach to legitimacy in criminology (2012) Journal of Criminal Law and Criminology, 102, pp. 119-170; Bradford, B., Jackson, J., Stanko, E.A., Contact and confidence: Revisiting the impact of public encounters with the police (2009) Policing and Society, 19 (1), pp. 20-46; Brown, W., (2006) Regulating Aversion: Tolerance in the Age of Identity and Empire, , Princeton, NJ, Princeton University Press; Bryant, L., Times past: The gay and lesbian police employees network (Victoria, Australia) (2012) Prime Timers Worldwide, , http://www.primetimersww.com/index.php?option=com_k2&view=item&id=111:times-past&Itemid=590, :; Carbery, G., (1995) A History of the Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras, , Parkville, Australian Lesbian and Gay Archives; Chulov, M., The force is with her: The rise and rise of Australia’s frist female police chief (2002) The Weekend Australian Magazine, pp. 13-15; Condon, R., Power to the force (2002) The Age, p. 10. , p; Crawford, C., Police gay payday – pay for officers who attend gay parade, whether on duty or not (2003) Herald Sun, p. 5. , p; de Kretser, L., Pride of force a hit at gay march (2002) The Herald Sun, p. 5. , p; Donovan, B., (2002) Transcript: The Nixon Years, , http://www.abc.net.au/austory/transcripts/s533773.htm, :; Doran, G., Big brother marches?

In this piece we use Anna Gensler’s Instagram art project Instagranniepants to examine how women are appropriating the language and practices of the cyber realm to expose online sexual harassment and to engender a creative resistance which is critical, comedic and entertaining. Drawing from interdisciplinary literature on witnessing, satire and shaming, we explore the techniques Gensler uses to not only document harassment but also resist, engage and punish those who seek to perpetrate it. This article problematises the stereotype of women as passive victims of online public spaces, and is critical of popular discourses that portray online spaces as exclusively risky and that position women as the natural victims of online violence. It concludes that a more nuanced account of women’s negotiation of online spaces is necessary, particularly as an overarching narrative of risk and victimisation undermines the liberatory potential of the online realm. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.",Gendered violence; online sexual harassment; resistance; shaming; technologically facilitated violence,,,,,,,,,"(2015) Revenge porn kingpin Kevin Bollaert jailed, , http://www.news.com.au/world/revenge-porn-kingpin-kevin-bollaert-jailed/story-fndir2ev-1227291026978, 4, April, accessed 4 April 2015,. :; Albury, K., Crawford, K., Sexting, consent and young people’s ethics: Beyond Megan’s Story (2012) Continuum, 26 (3), pp. 463-473; Albury, K., Crawford, L., Byron, P., (2013) Young People and Sexting in Australia: Ethics, Representation and the Law, , Sydney, ARC Centre for Creative Industries and Innovation/Journalism and Media Research Centre, University of New South Wales; Amarasingam, A., Laughter the best medicine: Muslim comedians and social criticism in post 9/11 America (2010) Journal of Muslim Minority Affairs, 30 (4), pp. 463-477; Amico, E., Steinberger, L., Fighting for online privacy with digital weaponry: Combating revenge pornography (2015) NYSBA Entertainment, Arts and Sports Law Journal, 26 (2), pp. 24-36; Andenaes, J., (1974) Punishment and Deterrence, , Ann Arbor, University of Michigan Press; Barak, A., Sexual harassment on the internet (2005) Social Science Computer Review, 23 (1), pp. 77-92; Barnes, S.B., A privacy paradox: Social networking in the United States (2006) First Monday, 11 (9). , http://www.firstmonday.org/ISSUES/issue11_9/barnes/, accessed 28 October 2012,). :; Barreca, R., Introduction (1988) Last Laughs Perspectives on Women and Comedy, pp. 3-22. , Barreca, (ed), New York, Gordon and Breach,.

Juxtaposing media, cultural, and police representations of straight edge ‘crews’ and Juggalo collectives with the FBI’s Gang Threat Assessment, we detail how cultural politics and ideology underpin the social reality of gangs and thus the application of the police power. This paper, furthermore, considers critical conceptualizations of the relationship between police and criminal gangs. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.",Gangs; Juggalos; police; straight edge; youth culture,,,,,,,,,"20/20: Straight edge (1999) Transcript, , http://xthinkx.tripod.com/files/2020sxe.html, 26, March, accessed 18 October 2015, :; Altheide, D.L., Schneider, C.J., (2012) Qualitative Media Analysis, 38. , London, SAGE; (2007) Comments posted to Courage Crew?, , http://www.sxe.com/forum/showthread.php?4629-Courage-Crew, accessed 1 November 2015, :; (2014) Comment posted to 4 People Hospitalized, 20 Arrested as FSU and SOSF Crews Brawl Outside Firefest in Cleveland, , https://reddit.com/r/Hardcore/comments/23ohr6/4_people_hospitalized_20_arrested_as_fsu_and_sosf/, accessed 18 October 2015,. :; Armaline, W.T., Vera Sanchez, C.G., Correia, M., ‘The biggest gang in Oakland’: Re-thinking police legitimacy (2014) Contemporary Justice Review, 17 (3), pp. 375-399; Atkinson, M., The civilizing of resistance: Straightedge tattooing (2003) Deviant Behavior, 24 (3), pp. 197-220; Bartlett, T., Studying rock’s clean, mean movement (2006) Chronicle of Higher Education, 53 (29), pp. 12-13; Benjamin, W., Critique of violence (1978) Reflections, 14 (3), pp. 277-300; Binelli, F., Punk rock fight club (2007) Rolling Stone, , http://www.rollingstone.com/culture/news/punk-rock-fight-club-20070823, August,. :; Bittner, E., (1970) The functions of the police in modern society, , Chevy Chase, Maryland, National Institute of Mental Health, Center for Studies of Crime and Delinquency; Blankstein, A., LA sheriff candidate asked about ‘gang’ tattoo at debate (2014) NBC News, , http://www.nbcnews.com/news/investigations/la-sheriff-candidate-asked-about-gang-tattoo-debate-n74096, 17, April, accessed 1 November 2015,. :; Bogazianos, D.A., (2012) 5 Grams: Crack Cocaine, Rap Music, and the War on Drugs, , New York, NYU Press; Brown, A., They don’t do drink, drugs or casual sex, but they’re living on the edge: Meet the Scots who’ve decided to go straight (2005) Scottish Daily Record, , http://www.thefreelibrary.com/They+don’t+do+drink,+drugs+or+casual+sex,+but+they’re+living.+ON+THE…-a0131070936, 1, April,. :; Campbell, A., JuggaloBook, Insane Clown Posse’s social network, has nearly 10,000 members (2012) The Huffington Post, , http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/03/01/juggalobook-icp-social-network_n_1314334.html, 1, March, accessed 18 October 2015,. :; Chamayou, G., (2012) Manhunts: A Philosophical History, , Princeton, NJ, Princeton University Press; Clifton, H., Rioter profile: ‘I think police are probably the biggest gang in the world’ (2011) The Guardian, , http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/dec/07/rioter-profile-police-biggest-gang, 7, December,. :; Conquergood, D., Rethinking ethnography: Towards a critical cultural politics (1991) Communications monographs, 58 (2), pp. 179-194; Correia, D., (2016) Police gangs, , University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, NM, USA,.

What do women cops need to do to make the cut in an era in which, on the one hand, it seems they are more prevalent and have more opportunities than ever before (Gerrard, 2014); but also, on the flip side of this, in which they must somehow offer something ‘extra’ to survive in an era where the presence of a female detective in itself is no longer an innovation or novelty? In an era in which, to adopt Angela McRobbie’s much-cited phrase, ‘feminism has been taken into account’ (2007: 255), how can these series’ invocation of feminism or ‘feminist issues’ be understood as fundamental to their respective demise and triumph? I argue that, crucially, Prime Suspect USA’s account of sexist bullying in the NYPD was greeted as hackneyed and overblown, where The Fall spoke adroitly to a media culture in which ratings can be won via a superficial but glossily packaged nod to the female detective’s postfeminist ‘progress’, while relishing misogynistic violence. Hence the article also asks, what implications does an inquiry of the kind undertaken here – where interrogation of the genre combines comparative text-based analysis with critical reflection on the author’s own perturbed response to the eroticisation of violence against women in The Fall – have for future models of feminist criticism of TV crime drama? © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.",Eroticisation of violence; female detective; postfeminism; Prime Suspect; The Fall; TV crime drama,,,,,,,,,"Abramovitch, S., (2011) Is this the fedora that will doom NBC’s Prime Suspect?, , http://www.tv.com/news/is-this-the-fedora-that-will-doom-nbcs-prime-suspect-26406/, 2, August, accessed 15 July 2015,. :; Andreeva, N., (2011) NBC’s ‘Prime Suspect’ to shut down production, , http://deadline.com/2011/11/nbcs-prime-suspect-to-shut-down-production-195400/, accessed 15 July 2015,.

In doing so, we are interested in whether and how these critiques figure in relation to those doing criminology in the South, in particular in Asia. We first describe why media criminology has yet to develop as an area of study in its own right and what lessons we might draw from the development of media criminology in the Northern context. We then examine the contours of crime and media research in the East and Southeast Asian context, looking particularly at how existing studies on media and deviance reinforce or challenge traditional notions about problems and problem populations, and how media and deviance are intertwined in a variety of culturally inflected ways that reflect broader political institutions and political contestations. Third, we begin to sketch out the contributions from other disciplines to inform the study of crime and media in Asia. Here we suggest that some disciplines, particularly the rich tradition of sociology of media studies and cultural studies, may be better placed to analyze media and crime in ways that administrative criminology in the Asian context cannot. Significantly, as our preliminary mapping of media representations of specific crime issues in Asia indicates, studies on reporting crime and fictionalizing crime in Asia have produced critical insights into the construction of the crime landscape (its fears and concerns, its potential victims, and the role of the citizen and government) in the region. © The Author(s) 2017.",Asian criminology; Asian media and cultural studies; media criminology; media representations of crime; problem populations,,,,,,,,,"Aguilar, F.V., Mendoza, M.P., Candelaria, A.L.K., Keeping the state at bay: The killing of journalists in the Philippines 1998-2012 (2014) Critical Asian Studies, 33, pp. 243-266; Alexander, J.W., Japan's hiropon panic: Resident non-Japanese and the 1950s meth crisis (2013) International Journal of Drug Policy, 24 (3), pp. 238-243; Alvaro, J., Discursive representations of a dissident: The case of Liu Xiaobo in China's English Press (2013) Discourse and Society, 24 (3), pp. 289-314; Barak, G., (1994) Media, Process, and the Social Construction of Crime: Studies in Newsmaking Criminology, , New York: Garland; Barbour, B., Jones, R., Criminals, terrorists and outside agitators: Representational tropes of the other in the (2013) Geopolitics, 18, pp. 95-114. , 5 Xinjiang China riots; Brindle, A., A corpus analysis of discursive constructions of the Sunflower student movement in the English-language Taiwanese press (2016) Discourse and Society, 27 (1), pp. 3-19; Chan, A.K.P., Chan, V.M.S., (2012) Public Perception of Crime and Attitudes Toward Police: Examining the Effects of Media News, , Outstanding Academic Papers by Students (OAPS), City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong; Chan, H.Y., Chan, K.W., Cheung, K.Y., (2014) Hong Kong Newspaper Coverage of Police Deviance and Its Effect on Public Opinion Polls of Police Performance, , Master of Social Sciences thesis, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong; Cheng, K.F.J., (2007) Media Reporting of Triad Crime in Hong Kong Chinese Newspapers from 1970 to 2007, , Master of Social Sciences thesis, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong; Cheung, C.K., Chan, C.F., Television viewing and mean world value in Hong Kong's adolescents (1996) Social Behavior and Personality, 24 (4), pp. 351-364; Cheung, M.M.F., Wong, T.C., News information censorship and changing gatekeeping roles non-routine news coverage and news routines in the context of police digital communications in Hong Kong (2016) Journalism & Mass Communication Quarterly, 93 (4), pp. 1091-1114; Cheung, Y.W., Family school peer and media predictors of adolescent deviant behavior in Hong Kong (1997) Journal of Youth and Adolescence, 26 (5), pp. 569-596; Chik, K.Y., Ng, K.M.C., Tsang, H.S., (2015) Framing Bias: A Case Study of Local Newspaper Coverage of Hong Kong Police during the 2014 July 1st Protest, , Master of Social Sciences thesis, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong; Chow, Y.F., De Kloet, J., The spectre of Europe: Knowledge cultural studies and the 'rise of Asia' (2014) European Journal of Cultural Studies, 17 (1), pp. 3-15; Chu, D., In search of presumption: Youth and the new media in Hong Kong (2010) First Monday, 15 (2). , www.firstmonday.org/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/2772/245, (accessed 7 August 2016); Chun, J., Craig, T., A new kind of royalty: The imperial family and the media in postwar Japan (2000) Japan Pop!

As part of this trend, we report on an exploration of the terms hijabista and hijabster, which refer to female Muslim cultural identities centered on the nontraditional use of the hijab or Muslim headscarf. After situating the phenomena within the larger context of conservative regional politics and religion, we consider their cultural meanings in terms of mass and social media, suggesting that hijabista and hijabster cultures and identities are simultaneously hybrid and negotiated as young Muslim women, culture industries, and political and religious agents all employ a variety of strategies to shape emerging definitions. Finally, we reflexively discuss the implications of our own theoretical interests on interpretations of what it means to be a hijabista or hijabster. © The Author(s) 2017.",hijabista; hijabster; Islam; Southeast Asia; youth culture,,,,,,,,,"Abdullah, A.R., (1999) Islamic Dress Code for Women, , Riyadh: Maktaba Dar-us-Salam; Aljunied, K., (2016) Muslim Cosmopolitanism: Southeast Asian Islam in Comparative Perspective, , Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press; AlSayyad, N., Castells, M., (2002) Muslim Europe or Euro-Islam: Politics, Culture, and Citizenship in the Age of Globalization, , Lanham, MD: Lexington; Ang, R.P., Huan, V.S., Predictors of recidivism for adolescent offenders in a Singapore sample (2008) Justice and Behavior, 35 (7), pp. 895-905; Austin, W.T., Crime and custom in an orderly society: The Singapore prototype (1987) Criminology, 25 (2), pp. 279-294; Baharuddin, Z., How to spot a hijabster (2011) Free Malaysia Today, , http://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/opinion/2011/12/15/how-to-spot-a-hijabster/, 15.

Bodies that threaten to disrupt the seamlessness of events are seen as problematic. The expected response is to contain this overflow into physical spaces and to restrict their excesses to the online platforms. This essay argues that this separation of zones of affective excess signals a shift in how we understand the body, publicness and punishment in the face of ubiquitous digitality. It confronts this 'cleansing' acts of algorithmic regulation with a case study of the #KissOfLove campaign from India to show how the expected tropes that deal with concerns of safety of the body, the separation and weaving together of the digital and physical spaces, and the affordances provided by regulation and policy often unquestioningly mark bodies and spaces as overflowing and hence in need of curation, containment and cleansing. Building upon the narratives of technologised nation building in India, it complicates the terrain of the overflow, showing that a 'technoaffective' framework might lead to unpacking the ways in which selected bodies are rendered culpable and are forced to bear the marks of punishment in an emerging technosocial landscape. © The Author(s) 2017.",Affect; digital technologies; ICT4D; software studies; technosociality,,,,,,,,,"Achuthan, A., (2011) Re:Wiring Bodies, , Bangalore: The Centre for Internet & Society; Angelina, M., (2010) The 'Beyond the Digital' Directory, , http://cis-india.org/digital-natives/blog/the-beyond-the-digital-directory, (accessed 10 May 2016); Bhattacharya, S., (2011) Rabindranath Tagore: An Interpretation, , New Delhi: Penguin Viking; Bloch, J., Extra, extra - Read all about it: Nearly all binary searches and mergesorts are broken (2006) Google Research Blog, , https://research.googleblog.com/2006/06/extra-extra-read-all-about-it-nearly.html, (accessed 2 June 2016); Chatterjee, P., (1986) Nationalist Thought and the Colonial World: A Derivative Discourse, , Tokyo: United Nations University; Ceruzzi, P., (2003) A History of Modern Computing, , Cambridge, MA: MIT Press; Chun, W.H.K., (2006) Control and Freedom: Power and Paranoia in the Age of Fibre Optic, , Cambridge, MA: MIT Press; Engelbart, D., (1962) Augmenting Human Intellect: A Conceptual Framework, , http://www.dougengelbart.org/pubs/augment-3906.html, (accessed 2 June 2016); Gladwell, M., Small change: Why the revolution will not be tweeted (2010) The New Yorker, , http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2010/10/04/small-change-malcolm-gladwell, 4; Gosling, J.B., (1980) Design of Arithmetic Units for Digital Computers, , New York: Springer-Verlag; Haraway, D.J., (1991) Simians, Cyborgs and Women: The Reinvention of Nature, , Routledge: London; Hayles, N.K., (1999) How We Became Posthuman: Virtual Bodies in Cybernetics, Literature, and Informatics, , Chicago, IL: Chicago University Press; (2014) 'Kiss of Love' FB Page, Accounts Hacked, , http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/kiss-of-love-facebook-page-accounts-hacked/article6560728.ece, The Hindu. 3; Isaacson, W., (2014) The Innovators: How A Group of Hackers, Geniuses, and Geeks Created the Digital Revolution, , New York: Simon & Schuster; Japaridze, G., Introduction to computability logic (2003) Annals of Pure and Applied Logic, 123 (3), pp. 1-99; Kumar, P., Kiss of Love: Kerala govt's first mistake was siding with moral hooligans (2014) FirstPost, , http://www.firstpost.com/india/kiss-of-love-kerala-govts-first-mistake-was-siding-with-moral-hooligans-1785389.html, 3; Lee, T.B., (1990) Information Management: A Proposal, , https://www.w3.org/History/1989/proposal.html, (accessed 2 June 2016); McCarthy, J., Minsky, M.L., Rochester, N., (1955) A Proposal for the Dartmouth Summer Research Project on Artificial Intelligence, , http://www-formal.stanford.edu/jmc/history/dartmouth/dartmouth.html, (accessed 2 June 2016); Matti, T., (2014) The Science of Computing: Shaping A Discipline, , London: CRC Press; Nayar, P.K., Kothari, R., Snell, R., The vernacularization of online protests: A case study from India (2011) Chutneyfying English: The Phenomenon of Hinglish, pp. 71-81. , New Delhi: Penguin Books; Phadke, S., Khan, S., Ranade, S., (2011) Why Loiter?

This article focuses on the feminist media practices before and after the detention of the Feminist Five to shed light on the dynamics between state surveillance and incrimination, media activism, and feminist politics in China. Exploring the practices of the Youth Feminist Action School, it argues that the role of media in this new wave of feminist activism can be better understood as a form of ""digital masquerading"" in three ways. First, this captures the self-awareness and agency of feminists in their tactical use of media to circumvent censorship. Masquerading in the digital era is an active and self-conscious act leveraging the specificity of media practice to set the media agenda, increase public influence, and avoid censorship. Second, masquerading refers to the digital alteration of images in order to tactically represent women's bodies in public spaces while circumventing censorship and possible criminalization. It highlights the figurative and the corporeal in online digital activist culture, which are oftentimes overlooked in existing literature. Third, while the masquerade in psychoanalytic theory emphasizes individualized gendered identity, the notion of digital masquerade points to the interface between the medium and the subjects, which involves collective efforts in assembling activist activities and remaking publicness. © The Author(s) 2017.",China; digital; feminism; masquerade; media activism,,,,,,,,,"Barbin, H., Foucault, M., Panizza, O., (1980) Hersuline Barbin: Being the Recently Discovered Memoirs of A Nineteenth-century French Hermaphrodite, , New York: Pantheon Books; Berry, C., Martin, F., Yue, A., (2003) Mobile Cultures: New Media in Queer Asia, , Durham, NC: Duke University Press; Berry, C., Lu, X., Rofel, L., (2010) The New Chinese Documentary Movement: For the Public Record, , Hong Kong: Hong Kong University Press; Bolter, J.D., Grusin, R., (2000) Remediation: Understanding New Media, , Cambridge, MA: MIT Press; Brown, S., Media/crime/millennium: Where are we now?

The article contextualizes, criticizes, and expands the narrative of these films. Despite their largely positive international reception, the films lack historical context and neglect previous academic studies related to the mass killings - this article elaborates on these two aspects and expands the argument. It also reviews from the Global North news media and criticizes their biased forms of knowledge production. In addition, the article elaborates on receptions in the Indonesian national and local contexts, and reflects critically on the possibility of these two films contributing to the fight for social justice in Indonesia. © The Author(s) 2017.",Indonesia; knowledge production; mass killings; The Act of Killing; The Look of Silence,,,,,,,,,"Adam, A.W., (2007) Pelurusan Sejarah Indonesia, , Yogyakarta: Penerbit Ombak; Alatas, S.H., The captive mind and creative development (1974) International Social Science Journal, 26 (4), pp. 691-700; Althusser, L., Althusser, L., Ideology and ideological state apparatuses (1970) Lenin and Philosophy and Other Essays, pp. 127-186. , Paris: Monthly Review Press; Baker, J., Remembering to forget (2014) Critical Asian Studies, 46 (1), pp. 150-156; Bourdieu, P., Johnson, R., (1993) The Field of Cultural Production: Essays on Art and Literature, , Edited by.

The territory remained under Chinese rule throughout the period of British colonialism, with neither jurisdiction wishing to take active responsibility for its administration. In the postwar period, the area became notorious for vice, drugs and unsanitary living conditions, yet also attracted the attention of artists, photographers and writers, who viewed it as an instance of anarchic urbanism. Despite its demolition in 1993, KWC has continued to capture the imaginations of successive generations across Asia. Drawing on data from an oral and visual history project on the enclave, alongside images, interviews and observations regarding the 'second life' of KWC, this article will trace the unique flow of meanings and reimaginings that KWC has inspired. The article will locate the peculiar collisions of crime and consumerism prompted by KWC within the broader contexts in which they are embedded, seeking out a new interdisciplinary perspective that attends to the internecine spaces of crime, media and culture in contemporary Asian societies. © The Author(s) 2017.",Asia studies; cultural criminology; digital memory; postcolonial criminology; subcultures,,,,,,,This study was supported by a grant from the University of Hong Kong Seedcorn Fund.,,"Abbas, A., (1997) Hong Kong: Culture and the Politics of Disappearance, , Minneapolis, MN: University of Minnesota Press; Amagi, S., Kindaichi case files: Hong Kong Kowloon treasure murder case (2012) Weekly Shonen Magazine, , 17 October;17 December.

Yau Ching's (2010) We Are Alive documents a series of media production workshops conducted in juvenile correctional centres and training centres in Hong Kong, Macao and Sapporo, Japan. We Are Alive is a significant media text for analysis for two reasons. First, it is a youth-led documentary that offers a glimpse into settings that are often inaccessible to researchers, and second, it adopts a comparative perspective on three East Asian societies. The film offers rich data for sociological analysis as a point of access to understanding the lives of young people detained in correctional institutions in Asia. In analysing it, this article engages the contesting issues of social conformity, criminal justice, youth resistance and teenage masculinities and femininities through a close reading informed by a theoretical matrix comprising queer theory and cultural studies in an inter-Asian context. © The Author(s) 2017.",Documentary film; Hong Kong; Japan; juvenile delinquency; Macao; youth,,,,,,,,,"Adler, P.A., Adler, P., The demedicalization of self-injury: From psychopathology to sociological deviance (2007) Journal of Contemporary Ethnography, 36, pp. 537-570; Adorjan, M., Chui, W.H., Making sense of going straight: Personal accounts of male ex-prisoners in Hong Kong (2012) British Journal of Criminology, 52, pp. 577-590; Adorjan, M., Chui, W.H., (2014) Responding to Youth Crime in Hong Kong: Penal Elitism, Legitimacy and Citizenship, , Abingdon: Routledge; Ahmed, S., (2004) The Cultural Politics of Emotion, , Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press; Baldry, A.C., Bullying in schools and exposure to domestic violence in Italy (2003) Child Abuse & Neglect, 27 (7), pp. 713-732; Bosworth, M., Carrabine, E., Reassessing resistance: Race, gender and sexuality in prison (2001) Punishment & Society, 3 (4), pp. 501-515; Cacho, L.M., (2012) Social Death: Racialized Rightlessness and the Criminalization of the Unprotected, , New York and London: New York University Press; Chan, M.W., (1988) Control or Care: A Case Study of A Residential Home for Delinquent Girls, , MSc thesis, University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong; Chui, W.H., Detention center in Hong Kong: A young offender's narrative (2005) Journal of Offender Rehabilitation, 41 (1), pp. 67-84; Chui, W.H., Chan, O.H.C., Self-control, school bullying perpetration, and victimization among Macanese adolescents (2015) Journal of Child Family Studies, 24, pp. 1751-1761; Connell, R., (2007) Southern Theory: The Global Dynamics of Knowledge in Social Science, , Sydney: Allen & Unwin; (2012) Number of Casinos, , www.dicj.gov.mo/web/en/information/DadosEstat/2012/content.html#n5, Gaming Inspection and Coordination Bureau.

Despite the prevalence and normalisation of gender-based violence in Jordan, no scholarly engagements exist that unpack the role of the media in fostering this social acceptance. This paper aims to critically analyse the media's role by adopting a comparative approach to two types of femicide which have made headlines in the country: the first, a single mega murder which occurred in December 2013, and the second, a number of so-called honour crimes which occurred in 2008-2014. It argues that while both are manifestations of sexual violence, Jordanian media approach these femicides in wildly different ways and rank their victims differently. Drawing on criminological engagements with victimology, homicide and the media, the paper reveals the implicit assumptions and practices of Jordanian news media. This analysis is located within its Jordanian context, where violence against women, and even so-called honour crimes, are normalised. © SAGE Publications.",Arab media; femicide; honour; honour crimes; violence against women,,,,,,,,,"Abu Odeh, L., Honor killings and the construction of gender in Arab societies (2010) American Journal of Comparative Law, 58 (4), pp. 911-952; Al-Badayneh, D., Violence against women in Jordan (2012) Journal of Family Violence, 27 (5), pp. 369-379; Al-Batieh, M., The specific reasons behind Sharia student's death (2013) Alwakeel News, , http://www.alwakeelnews.com/index.php?page=article&id=78749#.U0VMg1ckSuI, 7.

Based on extensive ethnographic fieldwork with organised crime groups in disadvantaged locales, we argue that the rapid growth of cannabis cultivation is not the preserve of 'ghosts, gangs and good sorts'. Rather, these new markets reflect significant socio-cultural and technological transformations and the involvement of independent entrepreneurial criminals who, for the most part, come from impoverished neighbourhoods that have experienced, in recent years, a significant decline in legitimate job opportunities. This article offers new empirical data that shed light upon the organisation of commercial cannabis cultivation.

Under the totalitarianisms of Nazism and late Stalinism, a ""rootless cosmopolitan"" was a life-threatening epithet aimed at those people, namely ""the Jews,"" criminalized for supposedly lacking national allegiance and affiliating with foreign cultures. This paper argues that an ethical problem arises when cosmopolitanism is understood in cultural terms. To illuminate this problem in the particular, this paper interprets Dostoevsky's Crime and Punishment, specifically the novel's nationalistic themes and its cosmopolitan villain, Peter Petrovich Luzhin. In the unfolding analysis that draws from scholarship in cultural criminology, it is revealed that the Russian writer's designated masterful genius helped fuel one of the greatest crimes in history (the Holocaust) perpetrated against a people accused of cosmopolitanism. It is argued that interpreting the criminalization of Luzhin provides an allegorical occasion to gain conceptual clarity on present articulations of cosmopolitanism as a cultural construct. Attending to Dostoevsky's anti-cosmopolitanism, and those whom he has in/directly influenced on this subject, provides a rationale for critiquing cultural cosmopolitanism - a construct that is conceptually and materially dangerous. © SAGE Publications.",(inter)nationalism; Anti-Semitism; cosmopolitanism; crime and criminality; culture,,,,,,,,,"Appiah, K.A., Cosmopolitan patriots (1997) Critical Inquiry, 23 (3), pp. 617-639; Appiah, K.A., (2006) Cosmopolitanism, , New York: W.W.

In particular, drawing on criminological, philosophical and urban studies literatures, the article explores the notion of aesthetic order. The power to dictate aesthetic order is highlighted. The example of urban interventionism is used to consider those that challenge an approved aesthetic order. Here the article draws on cultural criminology and visual criminology, with illustrations coming from research in Toronto, Canada. Influenced by Alison Young's (2014a) conceptualisation of 'cities within the city', the article considers how different people using the same space have different or overlapping ways of understanding aesthetic order. Of relevance to criminology, it is contended that people or things that contravene an approved aesthetic order may face banishment and criminalisation. It is concluded that respect for such difference is required. An aesthetic criminology is suggested. © SAGE Publications.",Aesthetic criminology; aesthetic order; disorder; order; urban intervention,,,,,,"International Council for Canadian Studies, ICCS",The research in Toronto was funded by a Canada-Europe Award granted by the International Council for Canadian Studies.,,"Baker, S.A., The mediated crowd: New social media and new forms of rioting (2011) Sociological Research Online, 16 (4). , www.socresonline.org.uk/16/4/21.html, (accessed 14 October 2015); Arrests in Critical Mass bike ride near Olympic Park (2012) BBC News Online, , www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-19023104, BBC News (a). 28.

Much less has been written about the link between celebrity and criminality and the types of categories into which celebrified criminals fall (Jenks and Lorentzen, 1997; Penfold-Mounce, 2009). In the scant studies that do exist there is a thinness of attention to gender despite persuasive arguments within feminist criminological studies that crime is a gendered concept in news discourse (Jewkes, 2011; Smart, 1977). Using a qualitative content analysis of a selection of news articles on two high profile cases involving women convicted of a crime, Lindy Chamberlain (now exonerated) and Schapelle Corby, as well as recent work in the sociology of risk on desire and transgression, this research suggests that the current naming practices surrounding criminally implicated women do not adequately capture the constellation of gender-inflected media messages and the meanings with which they are imbued by sections of news workers. The implications of this research warrant a re-think of the customary labels ascribed to women convicted of a crime and the addition to existing taxonomies of a new category of celebrity, the 'deviant diva'. © SAGE Publications.",Celebrity; desire; Lindy Chamberlain; media; Schapelle Corby; transgression,,,,,,,,,"(1982) Azaria Books Must Wait, p. 2. , The Age. 3; (2005) Entrepreneur Trademarks 'Corby Case' Luggage, , http://www.theage.com.au/news/Corby-Case/Entrepreneur-trademarks-Corby-Case-luggage/2005/06/07/1117910276123.html, The Age. 7.

Though this novel style of policing carries no legal or moral authority, it is nonetheless 'taking hold' within a pluralised policing landscape where its effectiveness at apprehending child sex offenders is capturing public attention. While the emergence of digital vigilantism raises normative questions of where the boundaries of citizen involvement in policing affairs might be drawn, this paper is concerned with firstly, how this kind of citizen-led policing initiative comes into being; secondly, how it emerges as an identifiable policing form; and thirdly, how it acquires leverage and makes its presence felt within a mixed economy of (authorised) policing actors, sites and technologies. The paper sets out a detailed case study of a 'paedophile hunter' in action, read through a provocative documentary film, first broadcast on mainstream UK television in October 2014. This lays the groundwork for thinking through the cultural relations of digital vigilantism, and how this proliferating mode of policing practice is engendered and mobilised through affective connectivities, performative political imaginaries and culturally-mediated dialogical praxis. In seeking an entry point for theorising emergent policing forms and their connectedness to other policing bodies, spaces and things, the paper concludes with a thumbnail sketch of assemblage thinking. © SAGE Publications.",Assemblage theory; digital vigilantism; ontogenesis; paedophilia; plural policing,,,,,,,,,"Adler, A., The perverse law of child pornography (2001) Columbia Law Review, 101 (2), pp. 209-273; Asen, R., Brouwer, D.C., (2001) Counterpublics and the State, , (eds).

This paper examines community reactions to the removal of Banksy's No Ball Games for private auction. Five hundred unique reader comments on online newspaper articles reporting this controversial event were collected and analyzed. An emerging set of urban moral codes was used to position street art as a valuable community asset rather than as an index of crime and social decay. The latter discourse informed a repertoire that depicted No Ball Games as unlawful graffiti that was rightfully removed. Here, the operations of 'the police' (Rancière, 1998: 17) in the distribution of the sensible are evident in the assertions that validate and depoliticize the removal of No Ball Games. This repertoire was used to attribute responsibility for the work's removal to deterministic external forces, while reducing the accountability attributable to those responsible for the removal of the work. A contrasting anti-removal repertoire depicted street art as a gift to the community, and its removal as a form of theft and a source of harm to the community. The pro-removal repertoire incorporates and depoliticizes elements of the anti-removal repertoire, by acknowledging the moral wrong of the removal, but yielding to the legal rights of the wall owners to sell the work; and by recognizing the status of street art as valuable, but asserting that the proper place for art is a museum. The anti-removal repertoire counters elements of the pro-removal repertoire, by acknowledging the illegality of street art, but containing this to the initial act of making unsanctioned marks on a wall, after which point the work becomes the property of the community it is located within. This analysis reveals an emergent set of urban moral codes that positions a currently legal action as a form of criminal activity. © SAGE Publications.",Banksy; community attitudes; graffiti; stolen art; street art,,,,,,,,,"Andron, S., (2014) Reception Studies, , http://sabinaandron.com/reception-studies/; (2013) Banksy's No Ball Games Mural Removed from Tottenham Wall.

The apparently humanist positioning of women in prison as just like everyone else erases the specificity of women's backstories. Conversely, by adhering to the constructions of female prisoners as holding binary positions of either 'monsters' or 'victims' of the system, plays can re-inscribe morally unitary approaches to women's deviance and resistance. Many plays about women in prison hold a claim for resisting stereotypes and are in opposition to the injustice of criminal justice processes, and yet, in the realist mode, the monster/ victim position seems to be an inescapable binary. © SAGE Publications.",Clean Break; dramaturgy; feminist criminology; Performance; resistance,,,,,,,,,"Aston, E., (2003) Feminist Views on the English Stage: Women Playwrights, 1990-2000, , Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press; Aston, E., Feeling the loss of feminism: Sarah Kane's Blasted and an experiential genealogy of contemporary women's playwriting (2010) Theatre Journal, 62 (4), pp. 575-591; Balfour, M., (2004) Theatre in Prison: Theory and Practice, , (ed.).

When her pain is enmeshed with calls to support changes in our justice systems, it has the potential to bring about unconstitutional effects, for a mother's love has no end and so her life sentence can only be addressed with equal amounts of endless suffering for the said offender (Valier and Lippens, 2004). This paper explores the construction of the bereaved mother figure as a victim-hero within contemporary media enacted crime narratives. It examines two murder cases in the New Zealand context where a bereaved mother's displays of grief can be linked to changes made to the legal code. It will be argued that the character of the bereaved mother as a victim-hero has become a powerful agent of change that has implications for criminal justice system modification. It is argued that critical attention is required of criminology to the role of the good mother in criminal justice discourses, and in particular to the ways in which the good mother is characterised in mediated public discourses. © SAGE Publications.",Media; melodrama; motherhood; narrative; victim-hero,,,,,,,,,"Anker, E., Villains, victims and heroes: Melodrama, media and (2005) Journal of Communication, 55, pp. 22-37. , 11; Arnold, K., Sophie's family in despair (2009) Sunday Star Times, , 1; Best, J., (1999) Random Violence: How We Talk about New Crimes and New Victims, , Los Angeles, CA: University of California Press; Booker, J., My gift to Sophie will be saving others (2009) The New Zealand Herald, , 23; Cairns, L., Courts ""too slow and expensive (2009) Sunday Star Times, , 1; Cecil, D., Dramatic portrayals of violent women: Female offenders on prime time crime dramas (2007) Journal of Criminal Justice and Popular Culture, 14 (3), pp. 243-257; Christie, A., (1935) The Hound of Death and Other Stories, , London: Collins; Christie, N., Fattah, E., The ideal victim (1986) From Crime Policy to Victim Policy, pp. 17-30. , Basingstoke: Macmillan; Collins, J., (2009) Address to Sensible Sentencing Trust Conference, , Address presented at the Sensible Sentencing Trust conference, Taupo, New Zealand; Cowlishaw, S., Death of daughter ""like a life sentence (2012) Dominion Post, , 30; Cromer, G., Winick, C., Character assassination in the press (1978) Deviance and Mass Media, pp. 225-241. , Beverley Hills: Sage; Davison, I., MPs widen move for tougher bail laws to cover teens (2012) The New Zealand Herald, , 10; (2008) Mother's Sway Holds Court, , Dominion Post. 23; Durrheim, K., Quayle, M., Whitehead, K., Denying racism: Discursive strategies used by the South African media (2005) Critical Arts: South-North Cultural Media Studies, 19 (1-2), pp. 167-186; Edwards, J.L., Brozana, A.L., Gendering anti-war rhetoric: Cindy Sheehan's symbolic motherhood (2008) Journal of the Northwest Communication Association, 37, pp. 78-102; Ericson, R., Baranek, P., Chan, J., (1987) Visualizing Deviance: A Study of News Organizations, , Milton Keynes: Open University Press; Erikson, K., (1966) Wayward Puritans, , New York: Macmillan; Finn, J., Mathias, D., Mansfield, R., (2013) Criminal Procedure in New Zealand, , Wellington: Thomson Reuters; Fuatai, T., Gay, E., Protesters' calls on bail law will be heard, says Key (2012) The New Zealand Herald, , 28; Gale, M.R.M., (2010) Provoked to Action: The Implications of Repealing the Provocation Defence to Murder, , Honours thesis, University of Otago, New Zealand; Garland, D., (2001) The Culture of Control: Crime and Social Order in Contemporary Society, , Oxford: Oxford University Press; Garner, A.C., Slattery, K., The World War II patriotic mother: A cultural ideal in the US press (2010) Journalism Studies, 11 (2), pp. 143-157; Gay, E., Partial defence of provocation set to be dumped (2009) The New Zealand Herald, , 23; Gekoski, A., Adler, J.L., Gray, J.M., Interviewing women bereaved by homicide: Reports of secondary victimization by the criminal justice system (2013) International Review of Victimology, 19 (3), pp. 307-329; Gilchrist, K., Newsworthy"" victims?

Yet rarely have visual methods been used critically in prison ethnography; image-making and images themselves have been used illustratively rather than as constitutive sites of knowledge production and, therefore, as objects to be interrogated in their own right by the researcher through, for example, participant collaboration. This paper focuses on the use of 'photo-elicitation' interviewing as a method for unpacking prison officers' use of force. The discussion is based on an ethnography conducted inside an Italian custodial complex that hosts both a forensic psychiatric hospital and a prison. Prison officers, psychiatric staff and prisoners were invited to discuss a number of images produced by the researcher-in the wing where they were working and/or living-representing the use of force and violence, thereby helping the researcher to address what Joe Sim (2008: 187) calls an 'inconvenient criminological truth' and at the same time giving the participants a voice. © SAGE Publications.",asylum; coercion; photo-elicitation; prison ethnography; prison officers; use of force; violence; visual criminology,,,,,,,,,"Barthes, R., (1977) Image, Music, Text, , New York: Hill and Wang; Carrabine, E., (2008) Crime, Culture and the Media, , Cambridge: Polity; Cohen, S., (2001) States of Denial: Knowing about Atrocities and Suffering, , Cambridge: Polity; Cohen, S., Taylor, L., (1972) Psychological Survival: Experience of Long Term Imprisonment, , Harmondsworth: Penguin; Collier, J., Collier, M., (1967) Visual Anthropology.

They provide a lot of what qualitative researchers consider data, but as a discursive form have received only scant attention in criminology. From interviews with imprisoned drug dealers in Norway, this paper identifies three forms of narrative: first, life-stories summarizing and reducing the immense complexity of individual lives; second, stories about particular events such as narrative turning points in life-stories, but also less significant episodes; finally, tropes that only hint at familiar stories. These different narrative forms are crucial in understanding the manifold and central role of stories in society. They can only be understood as part of the interactional context of storytelling, and as proposed by narrative criminology, their effects are essential for understanding crime and harmful action. In this paper I argue that tropes are the most salient forms of narrative. They are indicative of that which 'goes without saying', and can be used to identify both ambiguity and hegemonic discourse. In such efforts narrative criminology needs to move beyond interpretation of full narratives, to include reconstruction of stories from tropes. © SAGE Publications.",Ambiguity; event-story; hegemonic discourse; life-story; narrative; narrative criminology; story; trope,,,,,,,,,"Andersen, D., Storytelling in drug treatment.

Narrative criminologists ask how narratives, particularly narratives of the self, influence criminal and other harmful action. The idea that our stories shape our experiences is well developed in the humanities (literature, philosophy) and in the social sciences (anthropology, history, psychology, sociology). However, criminologists have caught on to that idea only recently, which is especially curious given abundant evidence of the impact of storied ideology on mass violence. This paper therefore addresses two critical questions: what is new and important about narrative criminology, and why has criminology only recently taken the narrative turn that other academic disciplines took decades ago? © SAGE Publications.",Culture; identity; mass harm; narrative criminology; narrative turn,,,,,,,,,"Agnew, R., Storylines as a neglected cause of crime (2006) Journal of Research in Crime and Delinquency, 43 (2), pp. 119-147; Alexander, J.C., (2003) The Meanings of Social Life: A Cultural Sociology, , New York: Oxford University Press; Anderson, E., (1999) Code of the Street: Decency, Violence, and the Moral Life of the Inner City, , New York: Norton; Athens, L., (1997) Violent Criminal Acts and Actors Revisited, , Urbana, IL: University of Illinois Press; Atkinson, P., Narrative turn or blind alley?

Through these stories, people associate with desired groups and create social boundaries separating them from the less desirable. While all people engage in boundary work, it is especially important for those who are physically or socially near members of stigmatized groups (e.g. drug users). My aim here is to examine how drug users narratively create symbolic boundaries to differentiate types of users (i.e. functional vs. dysfunctional). To elaborate on the general characteristics of these symbolic boundaries, I rely on qualitative meta-synthesis of research on boundary work among drug users and insights from my own research with people who use drugs. I draw from narrative identity theory to locate the places from which they derive their stories when creating symbolic boundaries and the content of the symbolic boundaries. I discuss the role of symbolic boundaries in facilitating drug use and inhibiting recovery and conclude by discussing the theoretical importance of using narrative criminology for understanding boundary development, boundary maintenance, and the content of boundaries. © SAGE Publications.",Drug use;

It begins by setting out structuralist analyses of narrative, before discussing an influential art historical approach to iconography and then turns to a substantive analysis of medieval penal imaginaries. Here the argument is that the images of extreme violence did not exactly reflect the realities of medieval life, rather they helped to dramatize them. The implications of this anthropological point are explored in the final section where the relationships between art, discourse and narrative are set out in further detail. © SAGE Publications.",Discourse; iconography; medieval; punishment; semiotics,,,,,,,,,"Aspden, K., Hayward, K., Presser, L., Sandberg, S., Narrative criminology and cultural criminology: Shared biographies, different lives?

How might it be defined? I suggest analyzing three levels of social interaction. At the first level, the culture of crime used by those committing crimes and the process of creating representations of crime in the news, entertainment products, and political position statements proceed independently. At the second level, there is asymmetrical interaction between those creating images of crime and those committing crime: offenders use media images to create crime, but cultural representations of crime in the news, official statistics, and entertainment are developed without drawing on what offenders do when they commit crime, or vice versa. At a third level, we can find symmetrical, recursive interactions between the cultures used to do crime and cultures created by media, popular culture, and political expressions about crime. Using the ""Rodney King Riots"" as an example, I illustrate the looping interactions through which actors on the streets, law enforcement officials, and politicians and news media workers, by taking into account each other's past and likely responses, develop an episode of anarchy through multiple identifiable stages and transformational contingencies. © SAGE Publications.",Cultural criminology; etiology; narrative criminology; riots; social interaction and crime,,,,,,,,,"Abelmann, N., Lie, J., (1995) Blue Dreams: Korean Americans and the Los Angeles Riots, , Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press; Bakhtin, M., (1984) Rabelais and His World, , Bloomington, IN: Indiana University Press; Bobo, L., Zubrinsky, C., Johnson, J., Public opinion before and after a spring of discontent (1994) The Los Angeles Riots: Lessons for the Urban Future, pp. 103-133. , (ed).

Reviewing narrative criminological research, this article contends that narrative criminology tends towards a problematic dualism of structure and agency, locating agency in individual narrative creativity and constraint in structure and/or culture. This article argues for a different conceptualisation of narrative as embodied, learned and generative, drawing on Bourdieu's notion of habitus. Social action, which here includes storytelling, is structured via the habitus, which generates but does not determine social action. This theorisation understands structures and representations as existing in duality, according a more powerful role to storytelling. The article concludes by discussion of the implications of such a shift for narrative interventions towards offending. © SAGE Publications.",Agency; Bourdieu; narrative criminology; offending; structure,,,,,,,,,"Ahearn, L.M., Language and agency (2001) Annual Review of Anthropology, 30, pp. 109-137; Archer, M.S., (2003) Structure, Agency and the Internal Conversation, , Cambridge: Cambridge University Press; Aspden, K., Hayward, K., Presser, L., Sandberg, S., Narrative criminology and cultural criminology: Shared biographies, different lives?

Immigration detention centres are frequently seen as concrete symbols of the most problematic side of state immigration control. Immigration detention is often seen as illegitimate by external (immigration law activists) and internal (detainees) critics. Detention centres, in short, frequently operate with a significant legitimacy deficit. This deficit creates problems for detention centre officers who want to feel good about themselves and the work they do. The professional role of the immigration detention officer can be personally challenging and emotionally demanding. Detention centre officers need to address the legitimacy deficit and somehow reconstruct themselves and the institution they work in as legitimate. This paper describes the narrative self-legitimation work that goes on when detention centre officers at the Police Aliens Holding Centre at Trandum, Norway share stories over lunch or a cup of coffee. © SAGE Publications.",Canteen culture; immigration detention; legitimacy; narrative criminology; techniques of legitimation,,,,,,,,,"Ashforth, B.E., Kreiner, G.E., How can you do it?

This article utilises diverse sources in order to chart his public representation, or cultural persona, as hangman from his rise to prominence in the mid-1940s to his portrayal in the biopic Pierrepoint (2005). It argues that Pierrepoint exercised agency in shaping this persona through publishing his autobiography and engagement with the media, although there were also representations that he did not influence. In particular, it explores three iterations of his cultural persona - the Professional Hangman, the Reformed Hangman and the Haunted Hangman. Each of these built on and reworked historical antecedents and also communicated wider understandings and contested meanings in relation to capital punishment. As a hangman who remained in the public eye after the death penalty in Britain was abolished, Pierrepoint was an important, authentic link to the practice of execution and a symbolic figure in debates over reintroduction. In the 21st century, he was portrayed as a victim of the 'secondary trauma' of the death penalty, which resonated with worldwide campaigns for abolition. © The Author(s) 2015.",death penalty; executioner; hangman; Pierrepoint,,,,,,,,,"(1965), [Television programme] 3 Clear Sundays BBC1: London; (1971) Motion Picture, , 10 Rillington Place Columbia Pictures: United Kingdom; The hangman's ordeal (1955) Sunday Chronicle, , A Legal Authority'. 17.

To forward the study of copycat crime, a methodology was developed to empirically score crimes that are suspected of being copycat crimes on a scale from ""unsubstantiated"" to ""substantiated"". The copycat crime measure utilized seven factors culled from the extant literature to differentiate and score a demonstration set of 51 candidate copycat crimes associated with commercial entertainment films. Two examples of analysis and research questions that can be subsequently pursued utilizing the scoring approach are provided.

However, in the cases of Rehtaeh Parsons, Jane Doe and Audrie Pott, photographs of sexual violence seem to have been taken and digitally disseminated without regard for the possible consequences. Thus, these cases pose disturbing questions about the ways that sexual violence is normalized and legitimized in western culture and the ways that new media is implicated in this process. These cases demonstrate how the ubiquity and permanence of digital photographs create new concerns for victims of sexual violence and new questions regarding the interpretive matrix of photographs. Using Judith Butler's theory on photography, torture and framing, I argue that these cases are an example of what Butler refers to as the digitalization of evil. Through this framework, I will discuss the ways that new media exacerbates experiences of sexual violence and examine issues surrounding the interpretation of photographs of sexual violence. © The Author(s) 2015.",cyberbullying; photographs; rape culture; Sexual violence; social media,,,,,,,,,"Steubenville: After the party's over (2013) 20/20, ABC News, , http://abcnews.go.com/2020/video/steubenville-partys-18795344, ABC News. 22.

This paper discusses a number of his writings, focusing particularly on his best known novel, The Conspiracy, where a revolutionary cell plans illegal political action. Conflict, nihilism, suicide and betrayal are among the topics stemming from the novel, which will be examined from a criminological perspective. The analysis will primarily address 'cultural' aspects of crime and refer to notions such as 'thrill' and 'seductions of crime' among others.

The decision to prosecute only one of the 100-plus men alleged to have paid her for sex made national headlines and gave rise to allegations of a conspiracy involving the highest levels of government and the judiciary. It also resulted in reform of the state's laws relating to the 'mistake as to age' defence. This paper examines news coverage of the institutional responses to this criminal matter in order to theoretically understand the relationship between contemporary journalistic representations of crime and politicised controversy about social problems such as child sexual exploitation. Drawing on an analysis of problem framing in news coverage and interviews with journalists and their sources, it investigates how the news value of the story was identified and seeks to identify the point at which news coverage tipped beyond social usefulness towards public outrage and conspiracy. © The Author(s) 2015.",child sexual exploitation; conspiracy; news criminology; news values; problem framing; sex crime; social action; Social problems,,,,,,,,,"(2011) Report Slams Child Protection Failings, , http://www.abc.net.au/news/2011-04-04/report-slams-child-protection-failings/2631004, ABC, 5 April.

In order to understand this variety, we reinterpret Ewald's theory on the transformations in the modern attitude towards risk and responsibility. Instead of distinct historical phases, the three attitudes identified by Ewald are simultaneously at play: punishment of delinquents, protection of victims, and precaution by the authorities. Only by taking all attitudes into account can we explain the variety of interpretations and the following, often contradictory, political responses. My findings also suggest that these three attitudes can be used as a model to make sense of contemporary security policies, which simultaneously emphasise punishment, protection, and precaution. © The Author(s) 2015.",Ewald; precaution; punishment; riots; Risk; security,,,,,,,,,"Adang, O., (2013) Er Is Geen Feest. de Overheidsreactie Op Project X Haren, , Deelrapport 1 Commissie 'Project X' Haren; Allison, G.T., (1971) Essence of Decision: Explaining the Cuban Missile Crisis, , Boston: Little, Brown; Bauman, Z., (2000) Liquid Modernity, , Cambridge: Polity Press; Beck, U., (1986) Risikogesellschaft.

The 1989 attack on a jogger in Central Park resulted in a well-publicized response from the New York criminal justice system that eventually led to the wrongful conviction of five innocent youths. This research investigates reporting surrounding the Central Park attack and how the media's response altered over the past 25 years. It argues that the Central Park jogger case offers an insight into the development of narratives of wrongful conviction and offers a typology to better understand how cases of innocence develop in print media. By exploring this case in reference to concepts including public narrative, signal crime and mediated witness, this paper focuses on the reporting on the case within The New York Times. It argues the newspaper played an important role in the public's perceptions of the five men as they evolve from the accused, the offenders, the punished, and finally, to become the wrongfully convicted. The findings contribute to a better understanding of the malleability of the media on public narratives, its readiness for violent crime and the lack of accountability in constructing public opinions that potentially damage the innocent. © The Author(s) 2015.",Central Park Five; Central Park jogger; innocence; public narratives; Wrongful conviction,,,,,,,,,"Althaus, S.L., Tewksbury, D., Agenda setting and the 'new' news: Patterns of issue importance among readers of the paper and online versions of the New York Times (2002) Communication Research, 29, pp. 180-207; Beckett, K., Sasson, T., (2000) The Politics of Injustice: Crime and Punishment in America, , Thousand Oaks, CA: Pine Forge Press; Bratton, W.J., The vigilance that can't let up (2000) The New York Times, 15; Buettner, R., City subpoenas film outtakes as it defends suit by men cleared in '89 rape (2012) The New York Times, 3; Burns, S., (2011) The Central Park Five: A Chronicle of A City Wilding, , New York: Knopf; Carrabine, E., Iganski, P., Lee, M., (2004) Criminology: A Sociological Introduction, , London, UK: Routledge; Christie, N., The ideal victim (1986) Crime Policy to Victim Policy: Reorienting the Justice System, pp. 17-30. , Fattah EA, (Ed.).

They can now access several categories of technologies that monitor social media and analyse their content. Social media monitoring is being trialled in a global context, and European Union member states in particular are contemplating the extent to which police should adapt to these investigative technologies. This exploratory research draws on a series of interviews to identify the grounds for establishment, set-up and on-going investment costs, and amount of staff required for social media monitoring.

Its focus is not simply upon how this search for finality functions, but on both the centrality of narrative within this and the question of consolation that arises when such cases officially remain unresolved. Examined by reference to one particular case - specifically, the deaths of five males in the South Australian city of Adelaide between 1979 and 1983 - the article explores the central role of cultural anxieties or phobias that often underpin infamous or iconic crimes. It examines the way in which the narrative of this case reveals particular anxieties associated with homosexuality and paedophilia as a means through which to investigate the complex way in which consolation is ultimately left wanting in spite of the presence of a narrative of culpability. In its entirety, the article attends to the enduring manner in which anxieties associated with sexual difference persist, and the haunting spectre that arises as a result of an unrealised search for finality. © The Author(s) 2015.",consolation; homosexuality; narrative; paedophilia; Serial killing; sexual abuse,,,,,,,,,"Arendt, H., (1963) Eichmann in Jerusalem: A Report on the Banality of Evil, , New York: Penguin Books; Bersani, L., Is the rectum a grave?

While there has been significant examination of various prison museums overseas there has been comparatively little published on these institutions in the UK Britain. In response to contending pressures, prison museums have endeavoured to present a balanced and objective depiction of past prison systems whilst their promotional websites, which serve to draw in customers, frequently rely on 'popular' depictions. These representations raise important questions as prisons cannot be seen as neutral or apolitical, neither those in the early 21st century nor those of the past. Despite these pressures, prison museums have great potential to increase public understanding of the prison; this paper promotes a more ethical, multi-perspective and politically diverse interpretation within prison museums. © The Author(s) 2015.",heritage; media; Prison; representations; tourism,,,,,,,,,"(1810) Ackermann's Repository of Arts, 4, pp. 161-163; (1898) A Guide to Lincoln Castle and Grounds (W.H.

In particular, the accidental leakage or deliberate harvesting of information, via either hacking or social engineering, is an omnipresent threat to a large number of commercial organisations and state agencies who manage digital databases and sociotechnical forms of data. Throughout the twenty-first century the global media have reported on a series of data breaches, fuelling anxiety among the public concerning the safety and security of their personal and financial data. With concern outpacing reliable information, a reassurance gap has emerged between the public's expectations and the state's ability to provide safety and security online. This disparity presents a significant opportunity for a commercial computer crime control industry that has sought to position itself as being able to offer consumer citizens the antidotes for such ills. This paper considers how neoliberal discourses of cybercrime control are packaged, branded and sold, through an examination of the social construction of the Heartbleed bug. It demonstrates how security company Codenomicon masterfully communicated the vulnerability, the product of a simple coding error, through its name, a logo and an accompanying website, in turn shaping news coverage across the mainstream media and beyond. © The Author(s) 2015.",Computer crime control; cybercrime; data vulnerability; Heartbleed; identity theft,,,,,,,,,"Aas, K.F., (2007) Globalisation and Crime, , London: Sage; Anderson, C., (2009) Free: The Future of A Radical Price, , London: Random House; Ayres, T., Jewkes, Y., The haunting spectacle of crystal meth: A media-created mythology (2012) Crime, Media Culture, 8 (3), pp. 315-332; Banks, J., Unmasking deviance: The visual construction of asylum seekers and refugees (2012) Critical Criminology, 20 (3), pp. 293-310; Barlow, J.P., A declaration of the independence of cyberspace (1996) Electronic Frontier Foundation, , https://homes.eff.org/~barlow/Declaration-Final.html, [Online] (accessed 02 July 2015); Data lost by Revenue and Customs (2007) BBC News, , http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7103911.stm, BBC News.

Little research has explored what visitors take from these encounters. Drawing on literature concerning new media communication and Brown's (2009) work on penal spectatorship, we analyze visitor comments about their sojourns into Canadian penal history sites found on TripAdvisor, a global travel website. We delve into the diverse stories that tourists share about their encounters with representations of incarceration, which we have found address the following themes: the performance of on-site actors; perceived authenticity of experiences and emotions; the convenience of visiting museums; attitudes about imprisonment; and views of penal history. Our research suggests that visits to penal history museums in Canada seldom translate into humanizing conceptions of the criminalized and views that challenge punitiveness among visitors, at least online. We also highlight how new media communications shape the actions of penal history museum workers in ways that tend to reinforce memorialization practices that foster social distance between authors and recipients of punishment. © The Author(s) 2015.",Canada; museums; Penal tourism; social media; visitors,,,,,,"Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada, SSHRC: 430-2012-0447","This study was produced as part of the Carceral Cultures research initiative ( www.carceralcultures.ca ), which aims to generate knowledge about Canada’s culture of punishment that informs and gives meaning to related penal policies and practices.

It makes two primary claims. First, the paper argues that the media has drawn on the themes of criminality, pathology and victimhood in articulating the tik phenomenon. Second, it is argued that these themes intersect with much deeper discourses, discourses that are especially pertinent to the South African context - such as race, sex and HIV/AIDS - in order to make meaning. The resulting moral framework encourages punitive approaches to the regulation of tik, while undermining reductive or rehabilitation-orientated regulation strategies. This occurs despite punitive efforts having never been consistently effective in the country. Consequently, the paper argues that media constructions of tik oversimplify a complex socio-political, economic and historically rooted phenomenon, frequently encouraging stigma and the exclusion of the tik user from society. This not only prevents more effective measures being thought possible, but frequently also serves to exclude those who already live at the very margins of society. © 2015 The Author(s).",Media; methamphetamine; pathology; South Africa; stigma,,,,,,,,,"Ajam, K., Rasool declares war on tik-tik (2004) Cape Times, 11, p. 3; Ayres, T., Jewkes, Y., The haunting spectacle of crystal meth: A media-created mythology (2012) Crime, Media, Culture, 8, pp. 315-332; Bailey, C., (2007) Rastas Give Tik Dealers An Ultimatum, , http://www.iol.co.za/news/south-africa/rastas-give-tik-dealers-an-ultimatum-1.313235#, accessed 3 June 2014; Berg, J., The rise of tik and the crime rate (2005) South African Journal of Criminal Justice, 18, pp. 306-328; Black, S., Stigma and ideological construction of the foriegn: Facing HIV/AIDS in South Africa (2013) Language in Society, 42, pp. 481-502; Blackman, L., Walkerdine, V., (2001) Mass Hysteria: Critical Psychology and Media Studies, , New York, NY: Palgrave; Bornman, E., Post-apartheid South Africa: A united or a divided nation?

How common the sequence where criminologists follow the media in the construction of crime and justice reality is unknown. The examination of the social construction of copycat crime suggested that the media create a new crime and justice construct through increased usage and modification of either newly minted or previously existing phrases that are disseminated as new crime and justice memes. In the case of copycat crime, media usage and public acceptance foreshadowed criminologists use of the phrase. A multi-step social construction process is hypothesized. A new construct becomes established and accepted in the public lexicon and popular media content; criminology researchers and practitioners note the increased public interest; renamed and reinvigorated research follows, and successful constructs become validated crime and justice phenomena. Employing the social construction history of copycat crime as a case study, this article details the social construction activities in the public and media spheres that created receptive environments for a unique new criminological construct to be developed. Traced from the inception of its component parts to its birth and adoption, the social construction of copycat crime demonstrates a useful methodology for the study of other crime and justice constructions and suggests that the relationship between criminology and the media regarding the social construction of crime and justice be further explored. © 2015 The Author(s).",Copycat crime; crime history; criminal justice concepts; news and crime; social construction,,,,,,,,,"Altheide, D., Snow, R., (1979) Media Logic, , Newbury Park, CA: SAGE Publications; Bandura, A., (1973) Aggression: A Social Learning Analysis, , Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice-Hall; Bandura, A., Menlove, F.L., Factors determining vicarious extinction of avoidance behavior through symbolic modeling (1968) Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 8 (2), p. 99; Barak, G., Newsmaking criminology: Reflections of the media, intellectuals, and crime (1988) Justice Quarterly, 5, pp. 565-587; Barak, G., (1994) Media, Process and the Social Construction of Crime: Studies in News-Making Criminology, , New York: Garland; Becker, H., (1963) Outsiders, , New York: Free Press; Bennett, W., Dilulio, J., Walters, J., (1996) Body Count, , New York: Simon & Schuster; Berkowitz, L., Macaulay, J., The contagion of criminal violence (1971) Sociometry, 34, pp. 238-260; Berkowitz, L., Parke, R., Leyens, J., West, S., Sebastian, R., Experiments on the reactions of juvenile delinquents to filmed violence (1978) Aggression and Antisocial Behavior in Childhood Adolescence, pp. 59-72. , Hersov LA, Berger M, (eds).

Scholars, however, have yet to examine media portrayals of incarcerated Muslims in the era following the attacks. In this article, I analyze newspaper reports published before and after the 9/11 attacks to examine whether representations of incarcerated Muslims shifted following the attacks. Findings indicate that although terrorism and the war on terror, inmate radicalization, and the significance of Muslim chaplains are themes that emerged only in post-9/11 reports, there is also substantial overlap in the content of reports published before and after the attacks. These findings are interpreted by drawing on the minority threat perspective. © 2015 The Author(s).",9/11; incarceration; inmate radicalization; media; Muslim prisoners,,,,,,,,,"Altheide, D.L., Moral panic: From sociological concept to public discourse (2009) Crime, Media, Culture, 5, pp. 79-99; Altheide, D.L., DeVriese, K., Perps in the news: A research note on stigma (2007) Crime, Media, Culture, 3, pp. 382-389; Althusser, L., (1971) Ideology and Ideological State Apparatuses (Notes Toward An Investigation in Lenin and Philosophy and Other Essays), , New York: Monthly Review; Ammar, N.H., Weaver, R.R., Saxon, S., Muslims in prison: A case study from Ohio state prisons (2004) International Journal of Offender Therapy and Comparative Criminology, 48, pp. 414-4428; Anastasio, P.A., Costa, D.M., Twice hurt: Newspaper coverage (2004) Sex Roles, 51, pp. 535-542. , reduce empathy and engender blame for female victims of crime; Atkinson, R., Smith, O., An economy of false securities?

It draws on an empirical corpus of 52 envelopes containing letters and leaflets designed to deceive recipients into parting with their money or personal details, and presents the analysis of eight extracts in illustrating the findings. This research draws on interactional methodologies to provide in-depth insights into the underlying techniques used in scams, and to identify a wider framework that accommodates and facilitates their effect. It explores and exposes what elements of the scammers communicative efforts are enlisted and directed towards the performance of particular acts such as inferring legitimacy and credibility, and inspiring urgency and secrecy. These elements combine to perform a range of highly effective communicative acts that, although the communication is mass-produced with no knowledge of the recipient other than a name and address, result in the exploitation of their individual vulnerability in a highly personalised manner. © 2015 The Author(s).",Communication; interaction; persuasion; scams,,,,,,,,,"Anderson, K.B., Consumer Fraud in the United States, the Third FTC Survey (2013) Staff Report of the Bureau of Economics Federal Trade Commission, , Stanford University: Financial Fraud Research Center, Center for Longevity; Baumeister, R.F., Sparks, E.A., Stillman, T.F., Vohs, K.D., Free will in consumer behavior: Self-control, ego depletion, and choice (2008) Journal of Consumer Psychology, 18 (1), pp. 4-13; Benwell, B., Stokoe, E., (2006) Discourse and Identity, , Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press; Berkenkotter, C., Huckin, T., (1995) Genre Knowledge in Disciplinary Communication, , Hillsdale, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum; Bhatia, V.K., (1993) Analyising Genre: Language Use in Professional Settings, , New York: Longman Publishing; Bhatia, V.K., (2004) Worlds of Written Discourse, , London: Continuum; Blanton, K., The rise of financial fraud: Scams never change but disguises do (2012) Center for Retirement Research, 12 (5), pp. 1-12; Carter, E., When is a lie not a lie?

Interrogating Border Security: Australias Front Line as an example of the emergent genre of border-based reality television, this article examines the programs cultural meanings and political functions. Through media spectacles that construct government authorities as heroic defenders protecting the nation from an array of external threats and fearful others, the program: legitimates state agendas; addresses anxieties associated with neoliberal globalization; and enrolls citizens as co-producers of national security. Accordingly, beyond representing, the program constitutes and prefigures the reality of border enforcement, rendering it inevitable, necessary, and desirable. © 2015 The Author(s).",Australia; borders; migration; reality-based television; surveillance,,,,,,,,,"Aas, K.F., Analyzing a world in motion (2007) Theoretical Criminology, 11, pp. 283-303; Adey, P., Airports, mobility and the calculative architecture of affective control (2008) Geoforum, 39 (1), pp. 438-451; The Age, Enforcing border integrity (2013) The Age, 5, p. 24; Anderson, B., (1991) Imagined Communities, , London: Verso; Andreas, P., (2009) Border Games, , Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press; Appadurai, A., (1996) Modernity at Large, , Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press; Barrow, C., The Return of the State (2005) New Political Science, 27 (2), pp. 123-145; Barry, A., Osborne, T., Rose, N., (1996) Foucault and Political Reason, , Chicago: University of Chicago Press; Bauman, Z., (1998) Globalization, , Cambridge, UK: Polity Press; Benhabib, S., (2004) The Rights of Others, , Cambridge: Cambridge University Press; Bigo, D., Security and immigration (2002) Alternatives, 27 (1), pp. 1205-1234; Bilig, M., (1995) Banal Nationalism, , London: SAGE Publications; Boltanski, L., Ciapello, E., The new spirit of capitalism (2005) International Journal of Politics, Culture, and Society, 18, pp. 161-188; Bosniak, L., (2008) The Citizen and the Alien, , Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press; Brett, J., (2003) Australian Liberals and the Moral Middle Class, , Cambridge: Cambridge University Press; Brown, W., (2010) Walled States, Waning Sovereignty, , New York: Zone Books; Butler, J., (2006) Precarious Life, , London: Verso; Butler, M., Something to declare (2004) Weekend Australian, 9, p.

While the discourse that emerges from these cases appears to do similar symbolic work as hate crime laws that condemn harassment based on sexual orientation, on closer examination the discourses can also be read as upholding discriminatory systems of patriarchy and heteronormativity in their attempts to explain the suicides as an expected or predictable response to homophobia and sexism. Framing Prince and Clementi as victims of bullying, rather than victims of poor mental health or family discord, creates a narrative that reifies rather than challenges repressive and discriminatory notions of sexuality and gender. © 2015 The Author(s).",Bullying; heteronormativity; media; patriarchy; victim,,,,,,,,,"Altheide, D.L., Ethnographic content analysis (1987) Qualitative Sociology, 10, pp. 1065-1077; Bazelon, E., (2013) Sticks and Stones: Defeating the Culture of Bullying and Rediscovering the Power of Character and Empathy, , New York: Random House; Berger, M., Computer assisted clinical assessment (2006) Child and Adolescent Mental Health, 11, pp. 64-75; Best, J., Victimization and the victim industry (1997) Society, 34, pp. 9-17; Brown, C., Legislating against hate crime in New Zealand: The need to recognize gender-based violence (2004) Victoria University of Wellington Law Review, 35, pp. 591-608; Brunstein Klomek, A., Marrocco, F., Kleinman, M., Bullying, depression and suicidality in adolescents (2007) Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescents Psychiatry, 46, pp. 40-49; Carrabine, E., Cox, P., Lee, M., (2004) Criminology: A Sociological Introduction, , Abingdon, UK: Routledge; Cavender, G., Bond-Maupin, L., Jurik, N.C., The construction of gender in reality crime TV (1999) Gender & Society, 13, pp. 643-663; Chesney-Lind, M., Palko, L., (2004) The Female Offender: Girls, Women, and Crime, , Thousand Oaks, CA: SAGE Publications; Christie, N., The ideal victim (1986) Crime Policy to Victim Policy: Reorienting the Justice System, pp. 17-30. , Fattah EA, (ed).

Trial by media is an emerging concept in crime media research; it illuminates how 21st-century mediascapes facilitate dynamic and interactive representations of crime, which may create spaces for alternative justice processes. Here we examine the impact of one victim's efforts to identify a house burglar by sharing surveillance photos of the crime itself on the Internet, and the ensuing consequences. We chart how images of this relatively minor property crime circulated on the Internet through social media and eventually became a significant story for local corporate news. We also explore the consequences of this process, both in terms of restorative justice and surveillance research. Specifically, we document the way that social media presents opportunities outside of the criminal justice process for redress of grievances. We also, though, document how social media can create a forum for both racist and hate speech around criminals and those perceived to be criminal, and finally, we consider the ambiguous implications of using personal surveillance technologies as primary crime prevention strategies. © The Author(s) 2015.",moral panic; New media; technology; trial by media,,,,,,,,,"Allan, S., (2006) Online News: Journalism and the Internet, , 1st ed.

In this article, an analysis is made of what her painting The Kleptomaniac (2005) and, in particular, what its title represents. Drawing upon art history, I begin by looking at the original Portrait of a Kleptomaniac (ca. 1820) by Géricault of which Dumas has painted her own version. This will be followed by a discussion of the history of the concept of kleptomania in psychiatry and an analysis of how that concept is reproduced by Dumas's painting. It will be argued that, by giving the portrait of a man the title of 'kleptomaniac' in 2005, Dumas represents a type of criminal in a way that neither does justice to the history of the concept of kleptomania, nor to the phenomenon itself. By mobilizing a contested and obsolete psychiatric concept as a title for a painting, the subject itself is mystified and the effect on the viewer of the painting is not only disorienting, but also ethically problematic. © The Author(s) 2015.",ethics of representation; kleptomania; Marlene Dumas; Théodore Géricault; visual criminology,,,,,,,,,"Abelson, E., The invention of kleptomania (1989) Signs: Journal of Women in Culture and Society, 15, pp. 123-143; Aimé-Azam, D., (1970) La Passion de Géricault, , Paris: Fayard;; Antheaume, A., (1925) Le Roman d'Une Épidémie Parisienne, la Kleptomanie?, , Paris: Gaston Doin;; (1968) Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM-II); (1980) Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM-III); (2013) Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM V); Barthes, R., (1984) Camera Lucida, , London: Flamengo;; Boime, A., Portraying monomaniacs to service the alienist's monomania: Géricault and Georget (1991) The Oxford Art Journal, 14, pp. 79-91; Borges, J., (1981) Borges: A Reader, , Monegal ER Reed A, ed.

The study was based on the premise that prominent media coverage would cause a greater number of perpetrators to be recognised than victims and that those victims who were recognised would be white children. Field research was conducted in a university and in non-university settings, such as fast food outlets, bus stops and shopping centres. All 20 images used were black and white headshots. Most photographs showed one person, but two photographs had two images. A total of 103 people were surveyed. The majority of our sample (78%) were unable to name any victims or perpetrators. These results provide strong evidence to suggest that despite 24-hour rolling news and the prominence of high-profile victims and perpetrators on the front pages of national newspapers, the public fails to remember who these victims and perpetrators are. We discuss why this may be so. © The Author(s) 2015.",High profile; media coverage; murders; public recognition,,,,,,,,,"Beckett, K., Sasson, T., (2000) The Politics of Injustice: Crime and Punishment in America, , Thousand Oaks, CA: Pine Forge Press;; (2014) Prison: The Facts - Autumn 2014, , London: Prison Reform Trust;; Bruce, V., Young, A., (2012) Face Perception, , Hove: Psychology Press;; Buckler, K., Salinas, P., (2009) 21st Century Criminology: A Reference Handbook, pp. 711-720. , Miller JM, ed.

For three decades before its closure in 2000, the Maze was the site of intense political struggle. The ruins of the Maze - a space once built to let no one out that now allows no one in - exist now in a state of limbo, between the conflicting narratives of the prison's troubled past, and an uncertain future. We present a brief historical account of the Maze, and explain our unconventional choice of 'research method', before introducing Foucault's notion of the heterotopia. We suggest that the Maze is an archetypally heterotopic space and our experience of exploring the prison can equally be described as such. © The Author(s) 2015.",autoethnography; cultural criminology; heterotopia; HMP maze; Urban exploration; visual criminology,,,,,,,,,"Andrews, R., New wilderness at the Maze (2010) The Dublin Review, 39. , www.thedublinreview.com/new-wilderness-at-the-maze, (Summer).

I consider these two separate and contrasting phases of his work from the viewpoint of someone whom Jock would have seen as an administrative criminologist in the 1980s and more recently as a datasaur. I offer some counterarguments in support of quantitative methods, on the one hand, and in harnessing these methods to policy research, on the other. My criticisms of his impact are not intended to detract from the overall value of his work, which was immense. © The Author(s) 2014.",administrative criminology; left realism; policy research; quantitative criminology,,,,,,,,,"Allen, R., Hough, M., Does it matter?

Through the Demi and Ashton (DNA) Foundations Real Men and Customs and Border Protection campaigns, we note that celebrities are no longer just public faces, but also members of a firm working with the state to recreate the illusion of state sovereignty, bolstering borders and divides.

However, it has been criticised for its notion of culture, its tendency to romanticise deviance and for its lack of engagement with policy development. Realist criminology, on the other hand, has expressed a commitment to taking crime and victimisation seriously and to being policy relevant. The question that this paper addresses is whether these two strands of criminology can be combined to produce an approach that is both critical and useful. This was a question that Jock Young raised in his later writings. © The Author(s) 2014.",critical criminology; cultural criminology; realist criminology,,,,,,,,,"Aas, K.-F., (2007) Globalization and Crime, , London: SAGE Publications; Archer, M., (2000) Being Human: The Problem of Agency, , Cambridge: Cambridge University Press; Bauman, Z., (2011) Culture in A Liquid Modern World, , Cambridge: Polity; Bourgois, P., (1996) Search of Respect: Selling Crack in El Barrio, , Cambridge: Cambridge University Press; Braithwaite, J., (1989) Crime, Shame and Reintegration, , Cambridge: Cambridge University Press; Currie, E., Against marginality: Arguments for a public criminology (2007) Theoretical Criminology, 11, pp. 175-190; Currie, E., Plain left realism: An appreciation and thoughts for the future (2010) Crime, Law and Social Change, 54, pp. 111-124; Davies, C., Goffmans concept of the total institution: Criticisms and revisions (1989) Human Studies, 12, pp. 77-95; Ferrell, J., (1996) Crimes of Style: Urban Graffiti and the Politics of Criminality, , Boston, MA: North Eastern University Press; Ferrell, J., Criminological Verstehen: Inside the immediacy of crime (1997) Justice Quarterly, 14, pp. 3-23; Ferrell, J., For a ruthless cultural criticism of everything existing (2007) Crime, Media, Culture, 3, pp. 91-100; Ferrell, J., Hayward, K., Young, J., (2008) Cultural Criminology: An Invitation, , London: SAGE Publications; Garland, D., Concepts of culture in the sociology of punishment (2006) Theoretical Criminology, 10, pp. 419-448; Goffman, E., (1968) Asylums: Essays on the Social Situation of Mental Patients and Other Inmates, , Harmondsworth, UK: Pelican; Hall, S., Winlow, S., Cultural criminology and primitive accumulation: A formal introduction to strangers who should really become more intimate (2007) Crime, Media, Culture, 3, pp. 82-90; Hamm, M., The ethnography of terror (1998) Ethnography at the Edge, , Ferrell J Hamm M, ed.

It is argued that one of Youngs unique legacies to criminology might be that, in fashioning the new, he tried out every conceivable method - including irony, satire and contradiction - for understanding and transforming the old. This is why he was constantly changing perspective, sometimes privileging one mode of analysis, sometimes another. But Youngs contradictory or challenging analyses never led to a closing-off of debate, either with others or, more importantly, with himself. So - and ironically - although each of his books is an invitation to think, rather than to follow, there is much to be learned from a critical appreciation of the courage with which Jock Young practised a fully sociological criminology. © The Author(s) 2014.",courage; critique; imagination; justice; knowledge,,,,,,,,,"Box, S., (1983) Power, Crime and Mystification, , London: Tavistock; Carlen, P., Review symposium: Vertigo (2008) Theoretical Criminology, 12, pp. 528-531; Carlen, P., Liquid Criminology: Doing Imaginative Criminological Research, , Haviid-Jacobsen M Walklate S, ed. forthcoming; Cohen, S., (1988) Against Criminology, , New Brunswick: Transaction; Durkheim, E., (1893) The Division of Labour in Society, , New York: Free Press; Durkheim, E., (1897) Suicide, , London: Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul; Garland, D., Criminology, culture, critique: A review of Jock Young, the Criminological Imagination (Cambridge: Polity, 2011) (2012) British Journal of Criminology, 52, pp. 417-425; Greenwood, V., Young, J., (1976) Abortion in Demand, , London: Pluto Press; Hall, S., (1970) The Manufacture of News: Deviance, Social Problems and the Mass Media, , Cohen S Young J, ed.

The Inquiry is notable in that it shone a light on a normally hidden policing function; it brought the backstage processes of police-media relations, part of police image work, to the frontstage area. This article considers the Leveson Inquiry and the data it collected as a case study of police impression management; it examines how the police sought to manage impressions about how they manage impressions. It takes a dramaturgical approach drawing on the work of Erving Goffman and Peter K Manning, combined with impression management concepts drawn from management and organisational studies. The article concludes that the identified impression management tactics used by different police teams combined to protect the collective police image and to reinforce, for the present, the dominant position of the police in their relationship with the press. © The Author(s) 2014.",impression management; Leveson Inquiry; police communications; police-media relations; reputation management,,,,,,Leverhulme Trust: RF-2013-060,"This work was supported by a Leverhulme Trust Research Fellowship, grant reference number RF-2013-060.",,"Albu, O.B., Wehmeier, S., Organizational transparency and sense-making: The case of Northern Rock (2014) Journal of Public Relations Research, 26, pp. 117-133; Arndt, M., Bigelow, B., Presenting structural innovation in an institutional environment: Hospitals use of impression management (2000) Administrative Science Quarterly, 45, pp. 494-522; Ashforth, B.A., Kreiner, G.E., Clark, M.A., Fugate, M., Normalizing dirty work: Managerial tactics for countering occupational taint (2007) Academy of Management Journal, 50, pp. 149-174; Barnett, M.L., Jermier, J.M., Lafferty, B.A., Corporate reputation: The definitional landscape (2006) Corporate Reputation Review, 9, pp. 26-38; Beetham, D., (1991) The Legitimation of Power, , London: Macmillan; Bolino, M.C., Kacmar, K.M., Turnley, W.H., Gilstra, J.B., A multi-level review of impression management motives and behaviors (2008) Journal of Management, 34, pp. 1080-1109; Brissett, D., Edgley, C., (1990) Life As Theater: A Dramaturgical Sourcebook, , 2nd edition.

Those pursuing 'public conversations' must develop strong rhetoric to make their causes salient and of interest to both the public and policymakers. The fact that penal reform is widely considered by journalists as having minimal readership appeal is indicative of the main issue campaigners face. Those seeking to influence policy reform for women are faced with a further barrier, in that social attitudes to male and female offenders differ. What language best, then, for campaigners seeking to influence government policy for women within this climate? Situated within the constructionist paradigm for social problems research, this article seeks to understand the different approaches and strategies - the 'messaging structures' or 'frames' - used by campaigners to influence politicians, the media and the public. Based on empirical data gathered from interviews with over thirty elite 'network' actors, it will also discuss journalists' attitudes towards penal reform and their opinions on women in crime news. © The Author(s) 2014.",issue framing; news media; penal reform; policy agenda; women offenders,,,,,,,,,"Andsager, J., How interest groups attempt to shape public opinion with competing news frames (2000) Journalism and Mass Communication Quarterly, 77 (3), pp. 577-592; Ball, S., (1994) Researching the Powerful in Education, , Walford G, ed.

In its dramatic use of home video footage in the context of crime reconstruction, Dear Zachary exemplifies the contemporary crime documentary and its mediated re-enactment of the past. Looking at the deployment of real crime images across different platforms, the author analyses how the crime documentary circulates as a cultural object, and explores how the emotional and affective attachments it solicits from viewers foregrounds the new contexts in which questions about judgement and the law, crime and ethics are being formed. Exploring its online reception on websites such as IMDB.com and Amazon, the essay considers how Dear Zachary calls upon the affective labour of spectators to reaffirm dominant social values regarding crime, victimhood and the family. Tracing the affectivity of the crime image as it is routed through the remediated home video footage in Dear Zachary and then, through the 'extras' on the DVD format, the essay suggests that the vehemence of the emotional response to Dear Zachary is ultimately not only about the horrible crimes it reveals but about the anxieties it raises regarding what is at stake in the public circulation of 'private' family images. © The Author(s) 2014.",affect; crime documentaries; emotion; home video footage; re-enactment,,,,,,,,,"Ahmed, S., (2004) The Cultural Politics of Emotion, , Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press; Arthur, P., Extreme makeover: The changing face of documentary (2005) Cineaste, 30 (3), pp. 18-23; Arthur, P., True confessions, sort of: Capturing the Friedmans and the dilemma of theatrical documentary (2003) Cineaste, pp. 4-7; Aufderheide, P., The changing documentary marketplace (2005) Cineaste, 3, pp. 24-28; Barnard, L., The Imposter review: Doc Thriller deserves Oscar nod (2012) The Toronto Star, , www.thestar.com/entertainment/movies/2012/10/11/the_imposter_review_doc_thriller_deserves_oscar_nod.html#, 11 October accessed 21 April, 2014; Barthes, R., (1993) Camera Lucida, , London: Vintage; Bell, V., The burden of sensation and the ethics of form: Watching Capturing the Friedmans (2008) Theory, Culture & Society, 25 (3), pp. 89-101; Bradshaw, P., (2012) The Imposter Â€"" Review, , www.theguardian.com/film/2012/aug/23/the-imposter-review, 23 August accessed 17 April 2014; Brown, T., (2008) Film and Television after DVD, pp. 81-100. , Bennett J Brown T, ed.

To do this, the paper considers the visual economies of police power in the United States by engaging what has been called the ""war on cameras"", or the police crackdown on citizen photographers who ""shoot back"" or ""stare down"" police. Despite US law generally endorsing the right for citizens to film or photograph on-duty public police officers, in recent years hundreds of cases have been documented where police have confiscated or smashed cameras, deleted film, or intimidated and threatened those wielding an unauthorized camera. For us, this crackdown on the unauthorized stare is a theoretically and politically insightful case study - a diagnostic moment - for engaging more openly and starkly the assumptions underpinning police power more generally, particularly the ways police power aims to actively fabricate social order by eradicating anything it deems a threat in the name of security. Ultimately, we argue that the violence holstered, literally and figuratively, on the hip of modern policing is inseparable from an attendant politics of staring and visuality that further extends and perpetuates state power's aim of pacification. © The Author(s) 2014.",authority; pacification; police power; visual economies; visuality,,,,,,,,,"Abel, E., (2010) Signs of the Times: The Visual Politics of Jim Crow, , University of California Press; Balko, R., (2010) The War on Cameras, , http://reason.com/archives/2010/12/07/the-war-on-cameras; Balko, R., (2010) When Police Videos Go Missing, , http://reason.com/blog/2010/08/12/when-police-videos-go-missing, August 12; Biber, K., (2007) Captive Images: Race, Crime, Photography, , London: Routledge; Butler, J., (1993) Reading Rodney King: Reading Urban Uprising, pp. 15-22. , Gooding-Williams R, ed.

On the one hand, for criminology scholars, Shakespeare can open up new avenues of theoretical consideration, for the criminal events depicted in his plays reflect complex philosophical debates about crime and justice, making interpretations of those events inherently theoretical; reading a passage from Shakespeare can be the first step in building a new theory of criminology. On the other hand, for criminology students, Shakespeare can initiate and sustain an intellectual transition that is fundamental to their professionalization, namely the transition from what I call a ""simplistic"" to a ""skeptical"" model of criminology. For this reason, I recommend that criminologists try what the Shakespearean scholar Julia Reinhard Lupton has called ""thinking with Shakespeare."" Thinking with Shakespeare is particularly valuable for criminologists because Shakespeare coded ancient philosophical ideas about crime and justice into the words and deeds of his characters: interpreting the drama takes us into the philosophy, and the philosophy provides us with the conceptual equipment for a better criminology. © The Author(s) 2014.",criminality; drama; dramaturgy; early-modern; humanities; interdisciplinary; literature; Renaissance; Shakespeare,,,,,,,,,"Adler, C.A., Richard III - His significance as a study in criminal life-style (1936) International Journal of Individual Psychology, 2 (3), pp. 55-60; Alshiban, A.S., Exploring criminology in literary texts: Robert Browning - An example (2012) Journal of Literature and Art Studies, 2 (4), pp. 454-463; Barnes, J., (1984) The Complete Works of Aristotle, pp. 2316-2340. , Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press; Barnes, A., (2011) Sherlock Holmes on Screen: The Complete Film and TV History, , London: Titan Books; Bate, J., (1998) The Genius of Shakespeare, , London: Oxford University Press; Bates, L.R., (2003) Shakespeare Matters: History, Teaching, Performance, pp. 151-164. , Davis L, ed.

This study provides a typology of hegemonic and ""complicit"" or subordinate policing and masculinity models in six of the highest-grossing American police movies as well as the representations of the ideal and unqualified officer in the online recruitment materials of departments serving the 25 largest American cities. While ""cop films"" are an established subgenre within Hollywood, official police websites represent an emergent medium for the dissemination of a cultural self-portrait. By studying these various reflections of the occupation, this project engages with the characteristics, traits, and attributes associated with the police across Hollywood movies and police recruitment webpages, finding stark tensions between the commercially mediated ideal and that of the public transcript of the police. This study theoretically and methodologically develops cultural criminology by addressing the self-portrait of the police alongside models of masculinity and policing provided by consumer-tailored media within the modern ""hall of mirrors."" © The Author(s) 2013.",Cultural criminology; Film; Hegemonic masculinity; Police; Web presence,,,,,,,,,"(1984) Beverly Hills Cop, , Martin Brest;; (2006) The Departed, , Martin Scorsese;; (2001) The Fast and the Furious, , Rob Cohen;; (1987) Lethal Weapon, , Richard Donner;; (2010) The Other Guys, , Adam McKay;; (1998) Rush Hour, , Brett Ratner;; (2012), http://www.austintexas.gov/department/police, Austin, TX Police Department (accessed 20 December 2012); (2012), http://www.bpdrecruit.com/, Baltimore, MD Police Department BPD Recruit (accessed 22 December 2012); (2012), http://charmeck.org/city/charlotte/cmpd/Pages/default.aspx, Charlotte, NC Police Department (accessed 21 December 2012); (2012), https://portal.chicagopolice.org/portal/page/portal/ClearPath, Chicago, IL Police Department (accessed 20 November 2012); (2012), http://www.chicagopolice.org/answerthecall/, Chicago, IL Police Department Answer the Call (accessed 20 November 2012); (2012), http://www.columbuspolice.org/, Columbus, OH Police Department (accessed 20 December 2012); (2012), http://www.dallaspolice.net/, Dallas, TX Police Department (accessed 21 November 2012); (2012), http://www.detroitmi.gov/DepartmentsandAgencies/PoliceDepartment.aspx, Detroit, MI Police Department (accessed 21 December 2012); (2012), http://www.elpasotexas.gov/police/, El Paso, TX Police Department (accessed 21 December 2012); (2012) Job Descriptions, , http://agency.governmentjobs.com/elpaso/default.cfm?action= viewclassspec&ClassSpecID=719440&Agency=1579&ViewOnly=Yes, El Paso, TX Police Department (accessed 21 December 2012); (2012), http://www.fortworthpd.com/, Fort Worth, TX Police Department (accessed 21 December 2012); (2012), http://www.hpdcareer.com/, Houston, TX Police Department (accessed 20 November 2012); (2012), http://www.indy.gov/eGov/City/dps/impd/Pages/home.aspx, Indianapolis, IN Police Department (accessed 20 December 2012); (2012), http://www.lapdonline.org/, Los Angeles, CA Police Department (accessed 19 November 2012); (2012), http://www.joinlapd.com/, Los Angeles, CA Police Department Join LAPD (accessed 19 November 2012); (2012), http://www.memphispolice.org/, Memphis, TN Police Department (accessed 22 December 2012); (2012), http://mpdacademy.com/index.php, Memphis, TN Police Department MPD Academy (accessed 22 December 2012); (2012), http://www.police.nashville.gov/, Nashville, TN Police Department (accessed 22 December 2012); (2012), http://www.nypdrecruit.com/, New York, NY Police Department NYPD Recruit (accessed 18 November 2012); (2012), http://www.phillypolice.com/, Philadelphia, PA Police Department (accessed 20 November 2012); (2012), http://www.sapdcareers.com/, San Antonio, TX Police Department SAPD Careers (accessed 21 November 2012); (2012), http://www.sandiego.gov/police/, San Diego, CA Police Department (accessed 21 November 2012); (2012), http://sf-police.org/, San Francisco, CA Police Department (accessed 20 December 2012); (2012), http://www.sjpd.org/, San Jose, CA Police Department (accessed 21 November 2012); (2012), http://www.seattle.gov/Police/, Seattle, WA Police Department (accessed 22 December 2012); (2012), http://mpdc.dc.gov/, Washington D.C.

Unattractive, alone, and obstinately unwilling to acknowledge his crimes, Ferguson conformed to dominant representations elsewhere of the stranger paedophile that demands ongoing governmental intervention. This article closely examines media and political discourses in which Ferguson has operated as a metonymic focal point for public considerations of child sex offending in Australia across the last decade, defined in relation to various conceptions of safe, responsible community. It considers public debates about how best to respond to the release of such offenders and the significance of Ferguson to the development of new Australian law and policy applying to sex offenders as an exceptional population, including extended supervision and continuing detention orders, and post-release institutions. As such, the article argues for close attention paid to the figures which garner media and political attention and around whom new policy approaches are developed, including their limiting effects for addressing problems such as child sexual abuse. © The Author(s) 2014.",Community; News media; Policy; Post-sentence; Sex offender,,,,,,,,,"(2008) Qld: Ferguson Released to Isolated Property Away from Kids, , Australian Associated Press (AAP) 2July; (2009) NSW: Ferguson Case Prompts Government Review, , Australian Associated Press (AAP) 20September; (2009) NSW: Rees Concerned Ferguson Beach Photo Might Scare Public, , Australian Associated Press (AAP) 28October; (2008) Paedophile Ferguson Suing for 'Victim of Crime' Compo, , 4July; (2009) Ferguson Law 'Keeps Everyone Safe', , Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) 23September; (2012) Website Names and Shames Child Sex Offenders, , Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) 15October; Ahmed, S., (2000) Strange Encounters: Embodied Others in Post-coloniality, , London: Routledge;; Angelides, S., Historicizing affect, psychoanalyzing history: Pedophilia and the discourse of child sexuality (2003) Journal of Homosexuality, 46, pp. 79-109; Angelides, S., Feminism, child sexual abuse, and the erasure of child sexuality (2004) GLQ: A Journal of Lesbian and Gay Studies, 10, pp. 141-177; Angelides, S., The emergence of the paedophile in the late twentieth century (2005) Australian Historical Studies, 36 (126), pp. 272-295; Barns, G., The right to a fair trial must be paramount (2008) Courier-Mail; Barns, G., How the media menaced Dennis Ferguson (2009) Crikey; Bartlett, A., We're not as big on child protection as we think (2009) Crikey; Borger, D., (2009) New South Wales Parliamentary Debates, , http://www.parliament.nsw.gov.au/prod/parlment/hansart.nsf/V3Key/ LA20090923009?open&refNavID=undefined, Legislative Assembly 18012, 23September (accessed 6 December 2013); Burley, L., Rehabilitation can work - Psychologist (2008) Chronicle; (2005) Beattie Acts on Pedophile Fears; Campbell, K., Protest pickets predicted against sex offender plan (2008) Morning Bulletin; (2009) Vigilantism Is Not the Answer to Dealing with Child Sex Offenders; Cansdell, S., (2009) New South Wales Parliamentary Debates, , http://www.parliament.nsw.gov.au/prod/parlment/hansart.nsf/V3Key/ LA20090923011?open&refNavID=undefined, Legislative Assembly 18024, 23September (accessed 6 December 2013); Carty, L., Why there should be no rest for the wicked (2009) Sun Herald; Castel, R., (1991) The Foucault Effect: Studies in Governmentality, pp. 281-299. , Burchell G Gordon C Miller P, ed.

However, its efficacy remains debated, with most measures of effectiveness being somewhat crude. More subtle effects of social marketing, such as the boomerang effect whereby the message engenders the opposite effect to that intended, have been detected, suggesting a need for modes of analysis sensitive to the multiple ways in which viewers react to social opprobrium. This article attempts to deliver just this. It begins with a short history and critique of the concept of social marketing. It then proceeds to explore the utility of the more complex notion that viewers often identify with the subject positions thrown open by social marketing on a quite temporary basis, before reconfiguring them. Using the responses of domestic abuse perpetrators exposed to the UK Government's This is Abuse campaign film, the article shows how contradictory identifications with both anti-violence messages and victim-blaming discourses are negotiated by those young men prone to perpetrating domestic abuse. The article concludes by exploring how effectiveness might be better conceptualised and assessed with regard to the impact of anti-violence social marketing that speaks to domestic abuse perpetrators. © The Author(s) 2014.",Boomerang effects; Domestic abuse; Social marketing; Subject positions; Violence,,,,,,"Economic and Social Research Council, ESRC: RES-062-23-2678","This work was supported by the Economic and Social Research Council, grant number RES-062-23-2678.",,"Brehm, J.W., Brehm, S.S., (1981) Psychological Reactance: A Theory of Freedom and Control, , San Diego, CA: Academic Press;; Burman, M., Cartmel, F., (2005) Young People's Attitudes Towards Gendered Violence, , Edinburgh: NHS Health Scotland;; Burton, S., Kitzinger, J., Kelly, L., (1998) Young People's Attitudes Towards Violence, Sex and Relationships: A Survey and Focus Group Study, , Edinburgh: Zero Tolerance Charitable Trust;; Butler, I., Drakeford, M., Booing or cheering?

News of teenagers committing suicide after taking the drug or dying of overdose had been presented in the pages of tabloid dailies for months when the government decided to ban the substance despite the lack of solid scientific data on the medical and social risks it posed. Drawing on Teun van Dijk's socio-cognitive approach to critical discourse studies, this article demonstrates how in its attempt to influence national policy the media largely responded to the new drug problem with panic discourses that perpetuated the old 'war on drugs' ideology, choosing to frame mephedrone as an agent of death and moral downfall even when its destructive influence was questionable. In this perspective, a blueprint made of multiple layers of historical drug scares and repressive drug policies shaped the metaphors and narratives used by the media to codify a sense of threat and by the audiences to interpret the symptoms of a social pathology. © The Author(s) 2013.",Discourse analysis; Drug panic; Drug scares; Drugs in the media; Fear; Mephedrone; Moral epidemic; Moral panic; Tabloids; War on drugs,,,,,,,,,"(2010) Consideration of the Cathinones, , https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/ file/119173/acmd-cathinodes-report-2010.pdf, Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs (ACMD) [accessed 2 June 2013]; Bertram, E., Blachman, M., Sharpe, K., Andreas, P., (1996) Drug War Politics: The Price of Denial, , Berkeley: University of California Press;; Chiricos, T., (2006) Critical Readings: Moral Panics and the Media, , Critcher C, ed.

It is focused on the findings of an exploratory investigation of newspaper reporting on these events in Britain and Eire between 1991 and 2011 and is concerned to address the potential relationship between this reporting behaviour and wider public understanding of these events. In so doing the paper falls into three parts. The first part presents an analysis of what is known about filicide-suicide: the academic narrative. The second part presents the findings of the empirical investigation referred to above: the media narrative. The third part explores the possible interconnection between these two narratives and the policy and professional context of responding to child abuse in the United Kingdom: the policy narrative. In the light of this analysis the paper considers what can be done about such family tragedies and the way in which we witness and make sense of them. © The Author(s) 2013.,Child abuse; Child protection; Filicide-suicide; Suffering; Witnessing,,,,,,,This paper was produced with the support of research work conducted by Jean Pownceby.,,"Arensman, E., McAuliffe, C., Corcoran, P., Williamson, E., O'Shea, E., Perry, I., (2012) First Report of the Suicide Report and Information System, , Cork: National Suicide Research Foundation; (2010) Safeguarding Pressures Project: Final Report, , Manchester: ADCS; Bandura, A., Self efficacy: Towards a unifying theory of behavioural change (1977) Psychological Review, 84, pp. 191-215; Barraclough, B., Harris, C., Suicide preceded by murder: The epidemiology of homicide-suicide in England and Wales 1988-1992 (2002) Psychological Medicine, 32, pp. 577-584; Berlant, L., (2004) Compassion: The Culture and Politics of An Emotion, , Berlant L, ed.

Sir Jimmy Savile (1926-2011) was a BBC celebrity, showbiz friend of the establishment and philanthropist. In October 2012, one year after his death, an ITV documentary alleged that Savile was also a prolific sexual predator who for decades had exploited his BBC status to abuse teenage girls. As we demonstrate, this incendiary documentary triggered a news media feeding frenzy that in less than one week destroyed Savile's reputation and thrust the BBC - the institution that made him a star - into a multi-faceted, globally reported CSA scandal. This study has four purposes. First, we propose a model of institutional CSA scandals that can account for critical transitions between key phases in the scandal process. Second, we apply this model to analyse the transition between the 'latent' and 'activated' phases of the Savile scandal. This transition corresponded with a dramatic transformation in the inferential structuring of Savile from 'national treasure', who had devoted decades to working with children, to 'prolific sexual predator', who spent decades abusing them. Third, we demonstrate how the BBC's denial of responsibility for Savile's sexual offending and its subsequent institutional cover-up triggered a 'trial by media' which in turn initiated the next phase in the scandal's development - 'amplification'. Finally, we consider the significance of our analysis of the Sir Jimmy Savile scandal for understanding the activation and development of scandals more generally. © The Author(s) 2013.",BBC; Celebrity; Denial; Institutional failure; Scandal; Sexual abuse; Sir Jimmy Savile,,,,,,,,,"Allen, H., Savigny, H., Selling scandal or ideology? the politics of business crime coverage (2012) European Journal of Communication, 27, pp. 278-290; Angelides, S., The emergence of the paedophile in the late twentieth century (2005) Australian Historical Studies, 36, pp. 272-295; Apostolidis, P., Williams, J., (2004) Public Affairs: Politics in the Age of Sex Scandals, , Durham, NC: Duke University Press; Barter, C., (1998) NSPCC Policy Practice Research Series, , London: NSPCC; Basinger, S., Rottinghaus, B., Skeletons in the White House closets: An empirical investigation into modern presidential scandals (2012) Political Science Quarterly, 127, pp. 213-239; Bellamy, A., (2012) How's about That Then? the Authorised Biography of Jimmy Savile, , Leeds: Great Northern Books; Bromley, M., (1998) Sex, Lies and Democracy: The Press and the Public, , Bromley M Stephenson H, ed.

While the mainstream media devoted much attention to ravaged bodies and sensational theories, state officials reacted to the crimes with a victim-blaming narrative that, activists have argued, provided a lethal accelerant to the violence. This paper explores the role of documentary film in the investigation and politicization of the murders and disappearances of women in Juarez. Along with activists and journalists, critical documentary filmmakers have been among the primary investigators of the crimes. In this paper, I argue that these grassroots media practices have been instrumental in opening spaces of communication that have been enclosed by pervasive fear and systemic insecurity. I pay specific attention to the ways in which Lourdes Portillo's 2001 documentary Señorita Extraviada interrogates the crimes politically. Through its critical, engaged approach to the aesthetics and politics of evidence, I argue, the film poses a counter-narrative to the neoliberal state's discourse of responsibilization and individualization in a context of systemic insecurity. © The Author(s) 2013.",Documentary film; Fear; Gender violence; Global grassroots communication; Impunity; Individualization; Responsibilization,,,,,,"Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada, SSHRC",This research was supported by a Post-doctoral Fellowship from the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada.,,"(2003) Mexico: Intolerable Killings: Ten Years of Abductions and Murders in Ciudad Juárez and Chihuahua, , http://www.refworld.org/docid/3f4dcd7d0.html, Amnesty International 11 August 2003, AMR 41/027/2003 accessed 4 June 2013; Bennett, J., (2012) Practical Aesthetics: Events, Affect and Art after 9/11, , London: IB Taurus; Berger, J., (1991) About Looking, , New York: Vintage International; Carrabine, E., Just images: Aesthetics, ethics and visual criminology (2012) British Journal of Criminology, 52, pp. 463-489; Fregoso, R., Voices without echoes: The global gendered apartheid (2000) Emergences, 10, pp. 137-155; Fregoso, R., (2003) MeXicana Encounters: The Making of Social Identities on the Borderlands, , Berkeley and Los Angeles: University of California Press; Fregoso, R., Coming to grips with feminicide (2012) Truthout, 5 (1). , http://truth-out.org/index.php?option=com_k2&view=item&id=5875: coming-to-grips-with-feminicide, 13 January accessed August 10, 2012; González, R., The said and the unsaid: Lourdes portillo tracks down ghosts (2003) Senorita Extraviada.

Drawing on Habermas's theories of the public sphere and Fraser's associated critiques, it argues that the Internet has become host to 'counter-publics' in which allegations of sexual violence are being received, discussed and acted upon in ways contrary to established social and legal norms. The potentialities of online technology (and social media in particular) to foster and disseminate counter-hegemonic discourses are examined through three case studies in which girls and women have used various online platforms to make extrajudicial allegations of sexual violence and abuse. Where alleged perpetrators of sexual violence are publicly named, it has been argued that such action represents an invasion of their privacy and a subversion of their right to the presumption of innocence and a fair trial. In online contexts such allegations can be received and understood very differently, and these understandings are then circulated in ways that can directly influence 'old media' coverage and court outcomes. However, as the paper notes, the principles upon which online counter-publics operate are not radically discontinuous with those of the hegemonic public sphere and not all girls and women have equal access to the support of online networks and activists. © The Author(s) 2013.",Gender; Internet; Justice; Sexual violence; Social media,,,,,,,,,"Acker, J., Class, gender, and the relations of distribution (1988) Signs, 13, pp. 473-497; Baker, K.J., We wouldn't know about the Steubenville rape case if it wasn't for the blogger who 'complicated' things (2012) Jezebel, , http://jezebel.com/5969076/we-wouldnt-know-about-the-steubenville-rape- case-if-it-wasnt-for-the-blogger-who-complicated-things, 17 December; Baker, K.J., (2012) How to Shut Down Reddit's CreepShots Once and for All: Name Names, , http://jezebel.com/5949379/naming-names-is-this-the-solution-to-combat- reddits-creepshots; Barrouguere, B., Savannah Dietrich confronts attackers while testifying in Kentucky courtroom (2012) Huffington Post, , http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/2009/2014/savannah-dietrich- testifies_n_1885500.html, 14 September; Bartkewicz, A., Court records to be opened in case of Kentucky teen who named abusers on Twitter (2012) New York Daily, , http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/court-records-opened-case- kentucky-teen-named-abusers-twitter-article-1.1146900, 29 August; Baudrillard, J., (1981) For A Critique of the Political Economy of the Sign, , St Louis MO: Telos Press; Benedict, H., (1992) Virgin or Vamp: How the Press Covers Sex Crimes, , New York: Oxford University Press; Beverley, J., The margin at the centre: On testimonio (testimonial narrative) (1989) Modern Fiction Studies, 35, pp. 11-28; Bhattacharyya, G.S., (2008) Dangerous Brown Men: Exploiting Sex, Violence and Feminism in the 'War on Terror', , London: Zed Books; Cannold, L., Teen boys lose their licenses, girls their reputations (2011) National Times, , http://www.smh.com.au/opinion/society-and-culture/teen-boys-lose-their- licences-girls-their-reputations-20110312-1bs4o.html, 13 March; Castells, M., Fernandez-Ardevol, M., Qiu, J.L., (2007) Mobile Communication and Society: A Global Perspective, , Cambridge MA: MIT Press; Christie, N., (1986) From Crime Policy to Victim Policy, pp. 17-30. , Fattah E, ed.

As such, we will first situate these films as part of the historical tradition of Gothic literature. This allows us to unpack the ways in which the depictions of the 'home' and 'homeliness' in Gothic literature and the 'home invasion' genre problematise constructions of identity and category formation. Secondly, exploring the genre in its contemporaneous socio-cultural setting allows us to see how particular social traumas are manifest in popular culture. These dimensions are explored by focusing on three key examples and their subsequent remakes: The Last House on the Left, Straw Dogs and Funny Games. © The Author(s) 2013.",Crime film; Domestic space; Home invasion; Other; Uncanny,,,,,,,,,"Ardrey, R., (1961) African Genesis, , Glasgow: Fontana/Collins; Ardrey, R., (1966) The Territorial Imperative: A Personal Inquiry into the Animal Origins of Property and Nations, , New York: Atheneum; Bachelard, G., (1958) The Poetics of Space, , Massachusetts: Beacon Press; Blake, L., (2008) The Wounds of Nations: Horror Cinema, Historical Trauma and National Identity, , Manchester: Manchester University Press; Botting, F., (2008) Limits of Horror: Technology, Bodies, Gothic, , Manchester: Manchester University Press; Bugliosi, V., Gentry, C., (1992) Helter Skelter: The Shocking Story of the Manson Murders, , London: Random House; Busch, A., (1999) Geography of Home: Writings on Where We Live, , New York: Princeton University Press; Capote, T., (1966) Cold Blood, , London: Penguin Books; Carroll, N., (1990) The Philosophy of Horror or Paradoxes of the Heart, , London: Routledge; Cavallaro, D., (2002) The Gothic Vision: Three Centuries of Horror, Terror and Fear, , London: Continuum; Chevalier, S., (2006) At Home: An Anthropology of Domestic Space, , Cieraad I, ed.

""Green criminology"" spans the micro to the macro, from work on individual-level environmental crimes to business/corporate violations to state transgressions, and includes research conducted from both mainstream and critical theoretical perspectives, as well as arising out of interdisciplinary projects. With few exceptions, there has been little work attempting to explicitly or implicitly integrate cultural criminology with green criminology and vice versa. This article promulgates a green-cultural criminology - an approach that seeks to incorporate a concern with the cultural significance of the environment, environmental crime, and environmental harm into the green criminological enterprise. It begins by demonstrating how cultural criminology is, at some levels, already doing green criminology. It then attempts to map a green criminology onto several key dimensions of cultural criminology: (a) the contestation of space, transgression, and resistance; (b) the way(s) in which crime is constructed and represented by the media; and (c) patterns of constructed consumerism. This article concludes by showing how a green-criminology-cultural-criminology cross-fertilization would be mutually beneficial. © The Author(s) 2012.",constructed consumerism; cultural criminology; environmental crime/harm; green criminology; green-cultural criminology; media; resistance; transgression,,,,,,,,,"Agnew, R., (2013) The Routledge International Handbook of Green Criminology, , South N Brisman A, ed.

Box 210, Old Westbury, NY 11568-0210, United States","This article analyzes media representation of minority offenders, and argues that media practice associates a minority status with criminal propensity through a process of minority signification. The focal point of the analysis is newspaper reporting of the 2003 Fukuoka family murder in Japan, in which three students from China killed a Japanese family. Close examination of two major Japanese newspapers suggests that their reporting of the Fukuoka case connects crime and a minority group in two ways. First, the newspapers frequently utilize nationality and immigration status as descriptors of the Fukuoka case suspects, and thus encourage an intuitive mental connection between foreignness and crime. Furthermore, opinion pieces and editorial articles interpret the murder in the context of immigration policies and the financial hardship often experienced by international students, suggesting that the Fukuoka case is one manifestation of international student criminality. The article concludes that signification of nationality and immigration status in the media may help explain the disparity between the relatively minor presence of foreign national offenders in Japan's crime scene and their major presence in the Japanese crime discourse. © The Author(s) 2012.",crime; immigration; Japan; media; social problem,,,,,,Waseda University,"The author would like to express her appreciation to Jane H.

In particular, the online gambling environment has been marketed as a site of 'safe risks' where citizens can engage in a multitude of different forms of aleatory consumption. This paper offers a virtual ethnography of an online 'advantage play' subculture. It demonstrates how advantage players have reinterpreted the online gambling landscape as an environment saturated with crime and victimisation. In this virtual world, advantage play is no longer simply an instrumental act concerned with profit accumulation to finance consumer desires. Rather, it acts as an opportunity for individuals to engage in a unique form of edgework, whereby the threat to one's well-being is tested through an ability to avoid crime and victimisation. This paper demonstrates how mediated environments may act as sites for edgeworking and how the potential for victimisation can be something that is actively engaged with. © The Author(s) 2012.",advantage play; crime; edgework; gambling; victimisation,,,,,,,,,"Abbott, M., Volberg, R., Bellringer, M., Reith, G., (2004) A Review of Research on Aspects of Problem Gambling, , Auckland University of Technology, Gambling Research Centre.

Box 2947, Tøyen, 0608 Oslo, Norway","In 1999, three people were found dead on a farm in the Norwegian countryside. Two pensioners and their middle-aged daughter were victims of a brutal murder that in the coming three years filled the Norwegian news media. Four people, two women and two men, were charged and convicted of the crime. The perpetrators were the son of the murdered pensioners, his wife, her sister and her sister's boyfriend. As is the case in many countries, women are rarely involved in planned and brutal homicide for gain in Norway, and this makes it interesting to investigate how such cases and female defendants are represented. This article investigates how cultural assumptions about gender and class influenced how the case and the four defendants were represented in media and court, and concludes that the two women were constructed as opposites in a variety of ways, a finding in line with studies elsewhere on female offenders. Differently from much of the research literature, the male perpetrators were not represented as the brains and muscle of the crime, but rather as dominated by two women who in ways related to class were described as dangerous femme fatales. © The Author(s) 2012.",class; gender; homicide; media analysis; representations,,,,,,,,,"Allen, H., (1998) Criminology at the Crossroads: Feminist Readings in Crime and Justice, pp. 81-94. , Daly K Maher L, ed.

Focusing on one year and an anti-meth legislative campaign, this paper maps the problematization of meth in the unique context of the rural Midwestern United States. Relying primarily on news media accounts, it illustrates various political and cultural currents constituting what is described as the ""illicit methamphetamine industry."" The paper illustrates how, by overstating realities of use, politicizing official statistics and reframing key events, authorities discursively link meth control to the wars on drugs and terror and broader securitization projects. The paper concludes with a theoretical discussion of how control of one drug, in one state, fundamentally alters everyday life - even in small towns of the rural Midwest. © The Author(s) 2012.",anti-security; governmentality; methamphetamine; risk; security state,,,,,,National Science Foundation,"As part of the drift toward securitization, the anti-meth regime helps normalize coercive governance and opens up new possibilities for state and non-state functionaries to market security for consumption ( Goold et al., 2010 ). For instance, coverage of a public “Terror Spotting” seminar in Kansas quotes a “counter-terror” specialist instructing citizens to use the same methods to “terror spot” used to locate “the meth house or the drug dealer.” She warns: Who’s going to notice these indicators out in the community? Law enforcement? They can’t be everywhere all the time. They can’t be expected to be. That’s just unrealistic. That’s why classes are being created for the public to learn what to watch for…It’s not unlike recognizing the signs of other threats—such as the meth house or the drug dealer. What you’ll see with meth labs is a funny smell, cellophane over the windows, traffic going in and out. Learning to recognize tip-offs of terrorist activity is the same idea as that. ( Finger, 2005b ) Zedner (2009) warns that this sort of conflation “permits expansive interpretation and wide application…allowing sellers to peddle their wares without specifying what is on offer” ( Zedner, 2009 : 10). As securitization imperceptibly expands, a growing cadre of “experts” like this one summon citizen hyper-vigilance, responsibilization and suspicious eye trained on vague “signs of threat.” Redolent of the budding “gang talk” industry in the United Kingdom, the garrulous expert here offers the menacing reminder that law enforcement “can’t be everywhere all the time,” pressing citizen activation in street-level securitization ( Hallsworth and Young, 2008 ). Similarly, innovated in Kansas and adopted by numerous states and Canada, “Meth Watch” follows “Neighborhood Watch” logics through a coalition of retailers, police and citizens trained to identify indicators of the “illicit meth industry.” Once again premised on vigilant suspicion, Meth Watch exemplifies neoliberal securitization strategies by shifting responsibilities and costs to the community and private contractors ( O’Malley and Palmer, 1996 ). The Meth Watch sign photographed against the backdrop of a small Kansas town ( Figure 6 ) is a street-level articulation of governing through meth logics and part of a vast securitization project swirling from “inside to the outside and back again, folding the foreign and domestic, the international and the everyday, into one another” ( Neocleous, 2011 : 45). Figure 6. Street-level securitization securing the rural. Despite facts to the contrary, risk-heavy warnings of “meth epidemics” beg all to turn inward and look on with suspicion—making the fear and discord of moral panics into everyday pressures. As the “letter to the editor” below shows, meth’s specter hangs heavy in the air and commands all to “stay safe.” Country rentals are prime locations. Meth labs are growing every day in Kansas. Little houses in rural areas, which can be rented, are prime locations for Meth makers to hide out in. We have lost one sheriff in Greenwood County, which points how dangerous these people can be. Screen your potential renters carefully. Stay safe. ( Lindsborg News Record , 2005 ) Springing to life in the minds of a worried public, these tiny moments of intrusion fabricate a sort of governance that is “beginning to look rather unpleasant” ( Hallsworth and Lea, 2011 : 142). Standing against such unpleasantness and the drift toward securitization requires that we see things like exaggerated “meth epidemics” for what they are, deliberate attempts to foster insecurity in such a way that no price for security is too great. Cultivating a transgressive politics of “anti-security” (see Neocleous and Rigakos, 2011 ) begins with recognizing and challenging the tiny moments in the drift toward securitization, wherever and whenever they emerge. I hope this paper offers such a challenge. Funding This research was partially funded with generous support from the National Science Foundation and the Rural Sociological Society. 1. US Census Bureau and the US Office of Management and Budget (OMB) provide the two most commonly cited definitions. The US Census asserts a “territory, population and housing units not classified urban constitute rural,” defining urban as settlement areas with more than 2,500 residents ( US Census Bureau, 1995 ). On the other hand, the OMB defines “rural areas” as those not located in a metropolitan statistical area (MSA) but in a county with less than 50,000 people. “Rural states” are those with a population density of 52 or fewer persons per square mile or those in which the largest county has fewer than 150,000 people. Kansas has two cities with over 150,000 population yet still qualifies as “rural” based on population density. 2. The service generated monthly statistical summaries including the total number of articles, column width of individual articles, where the articles appear in the paper and total monthly column width, headline, date and publisher. 3. Also see Lippert and Stenson (2010) . 4. Plots of the total number of articles each month and total column width of articles as indicator of meth coverage proved quite similar, therefore, the total number of articles illustrate the basic frequency of methamphetamine coverage. 5. By comparison, the service collected data on keywords “Kansas court system” and “smoking and tobacco” yielding 10,738 and 1,981 articles, respectively. 6. www.justice.gov/dea/concern/map_lab_seizures.html . 7. Clean, Learn, Educate, Abolish, Neutralize and Under-mine Production Act or CLEAN-UP. 8. 40 Kansas law enforcement agencies did not report standard UCR data in 2005. 9. Smurfing describes the circuitous process of collecting cold medicine for methamphetamine production. Often this is taken up by groups that trade cold pills with dealers for cash or other drugs. 10.

It is argued that much of the media coverage borrowed heavily from fictional depictions of crime. The boundaries between fictional and news representation are not only blurred by TV shows and movies that adopt a pseudo-verité style imitative of factual reporting but also, the Moat case suggests, by news media that borrow frameworks and formats from fictional media. The paper explores the role of academic commentary in such coverage and the opportunities that this might present for the development of a robust public criminology. It is argued that a better appreciation of the media framing of such events, as outlined in the first part of the paper, is crucial to the development of effective public criminological interventions in media coverage of high-profile criminal incidents. © The Author(s) 2012.",media framing; newsmaking; public criminology; Raoul Moat,,,,,,,,,"Barak, G., Newsmaking criminology: Reflections on the media, intellectuals and crime (1988) Justice Quarterly, 5, pp. 565-587; Barak, G., Doing newsmaking criminology from within the academy (2007) Theoretical Criminology, 11, pp. 191-207; Chancer, L., McLaughlin, E., Public criminologies: Diverse perspectives on academia and policy (2007) Theoretical Criminology, 11, pp. 155-173; Chibnall, S., (1977), London: Tavistock Publications;; Currie, E., Against marginality: Arguments for a public criminology (2007) Theoretical Criminology, 11, pp. 175-190; Dowler, K., Fleming, T., Muzzatti, S.L., Constructing crime: Media, crime and popular culture (2006) Canadian Journal of Criminology and Criminal Justice, 48, pp. 837-850; Feilzer, M.Y., Criminologists making the news?

In doing so it identifies key themes that frame masculine identities. Using the case of Raoul Moat, the piece analyses the discourses available in British newspapers to account for male violence. Raoul Moat killed one man, injured his ex-partner and a police officer and finally shot himself dead in the Northumbrian wilderness. Whereas most accounts of male violence blame 'bad' women, race, youth, terror, gangs and madness, here news stories evoked different tales of domestic, institutional and elemental masculinity. The themes of those tales, we argue, constitute broad contexts for constructing masculine identities and our analysis offers new insights into how masculine identity is constructed through discourse and why violence is a significantly male-dominated activity; insights which address some of the lacks in current theoretical work on both masculinity and violence. © The Author(s) 2012.",discourse; gender; masculinities; news; representation; violence,,,,,,,,,"Barthes, R., (1977) Image, Music, Text, , London: Fontana;; (2011) Timeline of Raoul Moat Shootings, , www.bbc.co.uk/news/10583120, BBC 26September.

In this article I argue that much of the programme's international appeal is due to two characteristics: its evocation of the British crime fiction canon, and its nostalgia. Numerous scholars have examined rural nostalgia in British cultural life, but I argue that the global popularity of Midsomer Murders signals a new phenomenon: the emergence of nostalgia for Britain's rural past among the non-British. I employ Jonathan Simon's concept of 'wilful nostalgia' to analyse this new phenomenon and critically explore recent controversies about the lack of racial and ethnic diversity in the case of Midsomer Murders. © The Author(s) 2012.",crime drama; globalisation; Midsomer Murders; rural nostalgia; wilful nostalgia,,,,,,,,,"Midsomer Murders' co-creator in race row (2011) ABC News, , www.abc.net.au/news/2011-03-15/midsomer-murders-co-creator-in-race-row/ 2656576, ABC News 15March (accessed 20 October 2011); Broadcaster sees red in all-white plot (2011) The Standard: China's Business Newspaper, , www.thestandard.com.hk/news_print.asp?art_id=109130&sid=31656471, Agence France-Presse 16March.

The first memoirs in this cycle form the subject of this paper: Sanyika Shakur's Monster and Luis Rodriguez's Always Running. There have been polarised debates about such texts which have been variously demonised as violent and sensationalist or, by contrast, praised as offering a pedagogic and preventative anti-gang stance. Such contradictory responses are reflected in the memoirs themselves, emphasising the frisson of violent gang exploits and the sober, salutary reflection of politicised and educated hindsight. The memoirs developed an extensive life in the media, becoming a site for channeling charged discussions about youth, crime, race, and violence, opening up a series of discourses about black/Mexican masculinity, censorship, celebrity, and cultural commerce. This paper seeks to understand how these popular narratives, with their charged themes and topical content, came to be interpreted by commentators. © The Author(s) 2012.",gangs; gangsta; media; memoirs; press,,,,,,,,,"Anshaw, C., A poet tells of life with la gangs (1993) Chicago Sun Times; Arispe, R., Gang survivor spins experience into literary gold (2005) Connexion; California cuts off face-to-face interviews with prisoners (1995) Associated Press; Athens, L., Dominance, ghettos and violent crime (1998) Sociological Quarterly, 39, pp. 673-691; Barras, J.R., Literary Lock-up; The Self-Imposed Bondage of Black Writers (1994) Washington DC City Paper; Barrios, G., Author's novel recycles without pizzazz (2005) San Antonio Express News; Best, J., (1995) Images of Issues: Typifying Contemporary Social Problems, , New York: Aldine de Gruyter; Bing, L., (1991) Do or Die: For the First Time, Members of America's Most Notorious Gangs-the Crips and the Bloods-Speak for Themselves, , New York: Harper Collins; Boyd, T., (1997) Am i Black Enough for You?

The first strand of criminological research involves the study of the processes through which aspects of everyday life have become criminalised; the second is that which has investigated the cultural practices known as graffiti and street art, often approached as manifestations of subcultures, as the products of new social movements, and as ambiguous images straddling the art/crime dichotomy. The article examines the response of law to uncommissioned images and words in public space, and investigates the law's judgment of illicit art and writing. Based upon research done as part of a three-year study of street art and graffiti in a range of jurisdictions, the article draws upon theories of affect to think through the ways in which the illicit writer or artist is constructed. © The Author(s) 2012.",criminal law; criminalisation; graffiti; public space; street art,,,,,,"Australian Research Council, ARC: DP0877799",The study was supported by the Australian Research Council ‘Discovery Projects’ funding scheme (project number DP0877799).,,"Alexander, H., Graffiti girl wins appeal against jail (2009) The Age, , www.theage.com.au/national/graffiti-girl-wins-appeal-against-jail- 20090304-8och.html, 4 March accessed 10 March 2009; Austin, J., (2001) Taking the Train: How Graffiti Became An Urban Crisis in New York City, , New York: Columbia University Press; Buchanan, R., Johnson, R., Strange encounters: Exploring law and film in the affective register (2009) Studies in Law, Politics and Society, 46, pp. 33-60; Campbell, F., (2008) Good Graffiti, Bad Graffiti?

New Labour's final term in office was dominated by the tension between the competing claims of liberty and security, expressed in Tony Blair's declaration after the 7/7 attacks, 'Let no-one be in any doubt, the rules of the game are changing.' We argue that insofar as crime, justice and civil rights are governed by a normative set of rules, they were subverted by New Labour in the mid-1990s for party political reasons. Thus, after 9/11, they needed little reshaping to meet the challenge of 21st-century terrorism. Our thesis is based partly on primary interviews and partly on analyses of media coverage, parliamentary debates and government responses in the form of press releases and speeches. The purpose of the interviews-with 'insider' figures from the world of politics, the police and civil society-was to triangulate the known policy responses to 9/11 with the views and perceptions of these figures to assess whether some of the assumptions about the impact of that event on the UK need to be rethought. © The Author(s) 2012.",civil liberties; media; New Labour; politics of response; terrorism policy,,,,,,,,,"Andrew, C., (2010) The Defence of the Realm: The Authorized History of MI5, , London: Penguin; Beck, U., The terrorist threat: World risk society revisited (2002) Theory, Culture and Society, 19 (4), pp. 39-55; Blair, I., (2010) Policing Controversy, , London: Profile; Blair, T., (2010) A Journey, , London: Hutchinson; Blunkett, D., (2006) The Blunkett Tapes: My Life in the Bear Pit, , London: Bloomsbury; Boyd-Caine, T., (2010) Protecting the Public?

Established debates around crime and media have long been based upon a fairly clear demarcation between production and consumption, between object and audience-the media generates and transmits representations of crime, and audiences engage with them. However, one of the most noticeable changes occurring in the wake of the development of new media is the proliferation of self-organised production by 'ordinary people'-everything ranging from self-authored web pages and 'blogs', to self-produced video created using hand-held camcorders, camera-phones and 'webcams'. Today we see the spectacle of people performing acts of crime and deviance in order to record them, send them and upload them to the Internet. This kind of 'will to representation' may be seen in itself as a new kind of causal inducement to law- and rule-breaking behaviour. It may be that, in the new media age, the terms of criminological questioning need to be sometimes reversed: instead of asking whether 'media' instigates crime or fear of crime, we must ask how the very possibility of mediating oneself to an audience through self-representation might be bound up with the genesis of criminal behaviour. © The Author(s) 2012.",demotic production; digital culture; mediation; new media; self-representation,,,,,,,,,"Aas, K.-F., (2007) Globalization and Crime, , London: Sage Publications Ltd; Abagnale, F., (2000) Catch Me if You Can: The True Story of A Real Fake, , New York: Broadway Books; Abercrombie, N., Longhurst, B., (1998) Audiences: A Sociological Theory of Performance and Imagination, , London: Sage Publications Ltd; Adorno, T., (1991) The Culture Industry, , London: Verso; Akwagyriam, A., Does happy slapping exist?

Using clichéd discourse ('crazed', 'epidemic', 'horror', etc.) and visual images of deformed and disfigured faces, the meanings attached to the drug are clear: crystal meth creates dangerous 'others'. Yet an identifiable crystal meth problem has hitherto failed to materialise, and press reporting of the issue appears to constitute an exemplary case of what Stuart Hall has described as a double movement within ideological discourse: a movement towards propaganda and a movement towards myth. This article examines how the threat of 'ice', as it is commonly known, has been symbolically, aesthetically and textually constructed in the British media, and how this representation has created its own hyper-reality, influencing political debate, drug policy and public reaction. The analysis places particular emphasis on the importance of visual images as a sensory expression of cultural meaning, an aspect of media representation that has too often been theoretically and pragmatically neglected within mainstream criminology. © The Author(s) 2012.",crystal meth; drug policy; myth; spectacle; visual images,,,,,,"University of Leicester, UoL

Coliseum Blvd., Fort Wayne, IN 46805, United States","This article offers a critical appraisal of the widespread argument that violent media content is to blame for deadly school violence. The departing premise of this study is that, because of its reliance on sophisticated technologies, popular culture productions represent manufactured risks. The implications of this approach are three: the 'impact' of popular culture will depend on the social risk positions students occupy within the social mapping of the school; there will be risks associated to the observational shortcomings of popular culture as a self-referent system; and the risks implied in controlling deviance in schools, including policies destined to cope with popular culture's presumed adverse effect on students' behaviors, must be explored. The risk approach allows us to understand school shooting events as the end result of a series of interrelated social, cultural, and political processes. The point at which these factors intersect tends to produce the conditions under which school shooters may emerge. © The Author(s) 2012.",manufactured risks; popular culture; school shootings; teen marginality,,,,,,,,,"Arcus, D., School shooting fatalities and school corporal punishment (2002) Aggressive Behavior, 28, pp. 173-183; Barry, T.D., Thompson, A., Barry, C.T., Lochman, J.E., Adler, K., Hill, K., The importance of narcissism in predicting proactive and reactive aggression in moderately to highly aggressive children (2007) Aggressive Behavior, 33, pp. 185-197; Bauman, Z., (2001) Community: Seeking Safety in An Insecure World, , Cambridge: Polity; Bauman, Z., (2004) Wasted Lives: Modernity and Its Outcasts, , Cambridge: Polity Press; Beck, U., (1992) The Risk Society: Towards A New Modernity, , London: Sage; Beck, U., Beck-Gernsheim, E., (2002) Individualisation, , London: Sage; Bender, A., Shubert, T., McLaughlin, P., Invisible kids: Preventing school violence by indentifying kids in trouble (2001) Intervention in School and Clinic, 37 (2), pp. 105-111; Besser, A., Zeigler-Hill, V., The influence of pathological narcissism on emotional and motivational responses to negative events: The roles of visibility and concern about humiliation (2010) Journal of Research in Personality, 44, pp. 520-534; Bishop, J.H., Bishop, M., Bishop, M., Gelbwasser, L., Green, S., Why we harass nerds and freaks: A formal theory of student culture and norms (2004) Journal of School Health, 74, pp. 235-251; Boden, S., Dedicated followers of fashion? the influence of popular culture on children's social identities (2006) Media, Culture, and Society, 28, pp. 289-298; Brown, M., Beyond requisites: Alternative starting points in the study of media effects and youth violence (2007) Journal of Criminal Justice and Popular Culture, 14, pp. 2-20; Burgess, A., Garbarino, C., Carlson, M., Pathological teasing and bullying turned deadly: Shooters and suicide (2006) Victims and Offenders, 1, pp. 1-14; Burstyn, V., (2001) Sport in Contemporary Society, pp. 10-20. , Eitzen S., ed.

The paper proposes an ideal-type of social democratic criminology, and contrasts it with the law-and-order perspective that displaced it after the 1970s. The sources and consequences of this seismic shift are analysed and evaluated. Finally, following the fracturing of the last forty years' neoliberal hegemony in the wake of the 2008 financial crash, it considers the prospects of a revival of the social democratic perspective in criminological thinking. © 2012 The Author(s).",critical criminology; neoliberalism; political economy of crime; radical criminology; social democratic criminology,,,,,,,,,"Backhouse, R., Bateman, B., (2011) Capitalist Revolutionary: John Maynard Keynes, , Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press; Beckett, K., (1997) Making Crime Pay: Law and Order in Contemporary American Politics, , New York: Oxford University Press; Bell, E., (2011) Criminal Justice and Neoliberalism, , London: Sage Publications Ltd; Benjamin, J., The narratives of financial law (2010) Oxford Journal of Legal Studies, 30, pp. 787-814; Berman, S., (2006) The Primacy of Politics: Social Democracy and the Making of Europe's Twentieth Century, , Cambridge: Cambridge University Press; Bernstein, E., (1911) Evolutionary Socialism, , Whitefish, MT: Kessinger; Bratton, W., Crime is down: Blame the police (1998) Zero Tolerance: Policing A Free Society, , DennisN.

In order to do this I trace the coexistence of three interrelated narratives on criminal victimisation-the academic, the cultural and the political-and suggest there are remarkable similarities between the victims we 'see' and the victims we fail to 'see' in each of these narratives, as there was in 1972. In tracing the provocative influence of the questions raised by Quinney's work over the last forty years, I suggest that his latter preoccupation with photography and the questions that he remains interested in to date afford a window of opportunity for the further development of a cultural victimology, but only if, as victimologists, we are prepared to embrace the principle of bearing witness. © 2012 The Author(s).",cultural victimology; politics of pity; Quinney; witnessing,,,,,,,,,"Aradau, C., The perverse politics of four-letter words: Risk and pity in the securitisation of human trafficking (2004) Millennium: Journal of International Studies, 33, pp. 251-277; Cain, M., Orientalism, occidentalism, and the sociology of crime (2000) British Journal of Criminology, 40, pp. 239-260; Christie, N., Conflicts as property (1977) British Journal of Criminology, 17, pp. 1-15; Christie, N., (1986) From Crime Policy to Victim Policy, , Fattah E.A., ed.

Using examples from across the cultural script, the paper introduces the concept of 'life stage dissolution' (and its attendant bi-directional processes of 'adultification' and 'infantilisation') to suggest it is becoming more difficult for young people to differentiate and disassociate themselves from the generation immediately ahead of them, and indeed vice versa. The result is a sort of generational mulch where shared and interchangeable cultural experiences are now the norm. The second half of the paper provides some preliminary and deliberately provocative remarks about the implications of life stage dissolution for criminology and criminal justice. This will include an analysis of emerging processes that I have termed 'pantomime justice', a useful way of understanding how crime stories today often seem to unfold as a conjoined adult-child experience in contemporary society. © 2012 The Author(s).",adultification; cultural criminology; infantilisation; life stage dissolution; lifestyle consumerism,,,,,,,,,"Arnett, J., Emerging adulthood: A theory of development from the late teens through the twenties (2000) American Psychologist, 55, pp. 469-480; Arnett, J., (2004) Emerging Adulthood, , Oxford: Oxford University Press; Arnett, J., Kloep, M., Hendry, L., Tanner, J., (2010) Debating Emerging Adulthood, , New York: Oxford University Press; Barber, B., (2007) Consumed: How Markets Corrupt Children, Infantilize Adults and Swallow Citizens Whole, , London: Norton; Barrett, C., (2012) Courting Kids, , New York: New York University Press; Berger, J., (1972) Ways of Seeing, , London: Penguin; Berlin, G., Furstenberg, F., Waters, M.C., (2010) The Future of Children, pp. 3-18. , Spring; Botterill, J., McRury, I., Richards, B., (2000) The Dynamics of Advertising, , London: Routledge; Brooker, C., (2009) Newswipe; Butler, I., Drakeford, M., Booing or cheering?: Ambiguity in the construction of victimhood in the case of Maria Colwell (2008) Crime Media Culture, 4, pp. 367-385; Calcutt, A., (2000) Arrested Development: Pop Culture and the Erosion of Adulthood, , London: Cassell; Cohen, P., Long road to adulthood is growing even longer (2010) New York Times; Côté, J., (2009) Handbook of Adolescent Psychology, , Sterling R.

The article begins by looking at the role of the criminologist in the emerging welfare state. Here the state was regarded as benevolent, while the task of the criminologist was to help guide penal policy along benevolent lines. We then chart the development of a more critical approach to the state, now conceived as an authoritarian formation by critical theorists who no longer considered themselves insiders. We then trace a range of forces that worked to marginalise the state now increasingly viewed as irrelevant. These include the triumph of neoliberalism, the reception of Foucault's work and globalisation theory on mainstream criminological thinking. We conclude by drawing attention to the reality of a post-welfare, neoliberal order, in which the state never went away, and profile recent attempts to theorise its nature. In the context of societies where state power is omnipresent in our lives, we suggest the time has now arrived when we need to reconnect the body of the King with his decapitated head. © 2012 The Author(s).",globalization; governmentality; neoliberalism; social control; state,,,,,,,,,"Bell, E., (2011) Criminal Justice and Neoliberalism, , London: Palgrave Macmillan; Clarke, R., (2010) The Sage Handbook of Criminological Theory, pp. 271-284. , McLaughlin E.

Only then can it equip itself to analyse the reality of a present and a future characterised by inevitable socioeconomic turmoil, and thus make a full and active contribution to intellectual and political life.

The very first deviancy conference also took place in York, in 1968, and the mode of critical engagement and outlook that found expression in that initial meeting had a hugely important role in the development of criminology. More deviancy conferences were held at York, and elsewhere, during the 1970s, and many of the organisers and delegates involved in the movement would go on to forge significant careers in the social sciences, making the trek from the anti-establishment margins to the very centre of academic criminology and the sociology of deviance. Digging up the old ‘deviancy conference’ ideals and imagery in an age in which critical criminology appears to have lost much of its spark as a result of its successful integration into the corpus of mainstream academic criminology proved slightly contentious. In the marketised world of 21st-century criminology—a world apparently structured on rational debate, inclusivity and fairness—many saw the 2011 meeting as an unnecessary provocation. Why do we need a deviancy conference when the dominant institutions of academic criminology embrace intellectual diversity and welcome vigorous theoretical debate? Doesn’t the annual British Society of Criminology Conference welcome a discussion of ‘critical issues’? In the paragraphs below, and as a means of framing the articles presented in this Special Issue, we offer a brief justification. The initial idea for the conference developed from our growing dissatisfaction with the direction in which academic criminology was heading. As Jock Young has often claimed, huge tracts of the discipline continue to be dominated by administrative ‘crime control’ discourses. Furthermore, we were of the opinion that critical criminology’s discourse with mainstream empirical criminology had been reduced to component parts of an increasingly popular but corporatised and mass-produced higher education product. The early successes of critical criminology appeared ultimately to lead to its co-option into the mainstream. For many of the growing number of disengaged and instrumental undergraduate criminology students, critical criminology was reduced to a section in a textbook, sitting alongside classical criminology, biological criminology and social learning theories, its vitality and history lost, its approach to knowledge accumulation and the operation of power unimportant. Increasingly students on undergraduate criminology degrees in the UK are offered a series of competing ideas, all of which are presented as having their own insurmountable problems. The postmodern injunction to be incredulous towards metanarratives is followed to the letter in the criminology textbooks we give to our students. They all tend to reinforce the notion that we should not believe in anything, and that we should remain sceptical of every criminological idea presented to us. For increasingly goal-driven students the best route forwards is to appraise the history of criminological ideas as one might a conference buffet, taking a little bit from each intellectual plate in the hope of creating an attractive combination of flavours and avoiding tasteless mediocrity and intellectual indigestion. For us, a structuring intellectual commitment to truth and at the least some sense of social justice must be present if criminology’s disciplinary dialectic is to move forward from its current position. The depressingly bland vista of contemporary criminological theorisation prompted the discussions that led to the 2011 conference at the University of York. We were firmly of the opinion that if critical criminology was to renew itself it needed a space in which new ideas could be discussed to help reanimate the discipline and to once again fill it with vigorous debate, incisive empirical work and ambitious theorisation. For us, critical criminology needed to find a new place in 21st-century criminology. It needed once again to take the lead in explaining and articulating a challenge to the staggering range of injustices, inequalities and harms that are an unavoidable by-product of a transformed postmodern and thoroughly globalised capitalism. We wanted to adopt the imagery of the original deviancy conferences and set it to work on a historical conjuncture radically different from the late 1960s and early 1970s. We wanted critical criminology to again become dynamic and unapologetic, to launch a withering critique not simply of rightist criminology but upon the world as it is. Our hope was that the conference might encourage critical criminologists to set about this task with renewed vigour. We contacted many of the criminologists and sociologists who attended the original conferences and who remain active in contemporary academic life. Many of these people were keen to be involved and were excited about the project. Jock Young travelled from New York to be with us. Stan Cohen and Frances Heidensohn travelled from London. Paul Walton had planned to travel to York from Australia, but was ultimately forced to cancel. Roy Bailey, whose music had been the accompaniment to the original conferences, joined us, as did Tony Jefferson, co-author of Policing the Crisis and Resistance Through Rituals . To this list we added a number of sociologists and criminologists whose work we admired. Jeff Ferrell, one of the key architects of the new cultural criminology, travelled all the way from Texas. Rob White, now associated with the development of green criminology, travelled from Tasmania. We were also joined by Pat Carlen, recent recipient of the British Society of Criminology’s lifetime achievement award, Keith Hayward, Sandra Walklate, Steve Hall, and the political theorist Alex Callinicos, who presented to the conference a stirring account of the causes of the current global economic crisis. The conference attracted many other notable academics. John Lea, Simon Hallsworth, Elliot Currie, Dave Wall, Yvonne Jewkes, Walter DeKeseredy, Joe Sim, Vincenzo Ruggiero, Katja Franko Aas, Molly Dragiewicz, Kevin Stenson, Robert Reiner, Roger Matthews, Reece Walters, Nigel South and many others contributed to an atmosphere of genuine intellectual excitement that also involved many talented younger academics keen to acknowledge the achievements of the past while at the same time developing the theoretical and empirical frameworks that might sustain and drive forwards 21st-century critical criminology. In total, around 250 delegates passed through the doors at the University of York in the summer of 2011. This figure was far more than we had expected, and perhaps suggests a growing desire for a reinvigorated critical criminology that looks anew at a world of rising inequalities, austerity cuts and a historic contraction of the global economy, a growing energy crisis and profoundly important ecological transformations. The conference wasn’t perfect. Tony Jefferson suggested that not enough time had been allowed for questions, and a number of others believed that the conference programme had been overly nostalgic, as if the late 1960s and early 1970s had been a golden era of theoretical exploration that couldn’t be matched or expanded upon. We have taken these and other criticisms on board, and hope that the next deviancy conference, tentatively timetabled for the summer of 2013, will be an improvement on the 2011 conference. The next conference will attempt to be more forward-looking and inclusive. We will, once again, attempt to attract high-calibre plenary speakers who can talk on issues related to the ongoing crisis and how we might attempt to understand the harms and injustices that are such a constant and disturbing feature of life today. Please keep a look out for our publicity material, and we urge all academics interested in critical issues to get involved with this project and to help shape its development. We were particularly pleased to be invited by the editors of this journal to put together a Special Issue based on papers presented at the conference. Crime, Media, Culture: An International Journal has, in its relatively short history, attempted to create a space for critical and radical sociological and criminological theory and penetrating empirical work. It has welcomed the kinds of vigorous critical debate that other journals appear to be quite wary of, and it seemed the obvious and natural home for a collection of articles drawn from our 2011 conference. This CMC Special Issue begins with a fascinating analysis of critical and feminist criminologies by Frances Heidensohn from the London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE). Frances delivered the closing plenary address at the 2011 conference to a packed lecture theatre. Few delegates had drifted away, and this is testament to her huge importance to the development of criminology since the late 1960s. Frances has of course been a leading figure in the development of feminist criminology globally. Attending the original conferences, she found much of value, but acknowledges that gender issues were always a marginal consideration. Frances’s central claim here is that feminist criminology has been successful while ‘critical theory and left realism are discarded or moribund’, a claim that will, no doubt, be read with interest by many students and academic criminologists. Robert Reiner, also from the LSE, and recipient of the 2011 BSC lifetime achievement award, is no lesser figure. His article ‘What’s Left? The future for social democratic criminology’ is a spirited critique of the corrosive nature of neoliberalism, a reassertion of the moral case for social democracy, and a descriptive account of the history and key elements of social democratic criminology. Robert’s article is followed by Vincenzo Ruggiero’s ‘How public is public criminology?’, a critical investigation of the current fashion of public sociology and criminology in the UK and North America. This is followed by ‘An economy of false securities? An analysis of murders inside gated residential developments in the US’ by Rowland Atkinson and Oliver Smith. Sandra Walklate, Eleanor Rathbone Chair of Sociology at the University of Liverpool, follows this with an article entitled ‘Who is the victim of crime? Paying homage to the work of Richard Quinney’. Simon Hallsworth and John Lea’s article, ‘Reconnecting the King with his Head: The fall and the resurrection of the state in criminological theory’, is next, and this is followed by Steve Hall’s critique of the development of critical criminology and its tendency to focus on systems of control at the expense of that which elicits the perceived need for control. Hall’s call for a renewed interest in the operation of global capitalism is timely and is sure to attract broad agreement from younger critical realist criminologists with a keen awareness of the painful reality of social and economic marginality in contemporary Western democracies. Our final article is by Keith Hayward, whose work spans critical, cultural and theoretical criminology. Keith offers a fascinating analysis of the ‘life-stage dissolution’ created by the cultures of late capitalism that encourage a bi-directional ‘adultification’ and ‘infantilisation’. We hope that these articles offer a realistic reflection of the range of analyses presented at the 2011 York Deviancy Conference and that they may help to energise critical criminology in the early phase of the 21st century towards a new period of growth and intellectual vitality. We would like to take this opportunity to thank all of those who helped to organise and administer the conference, the delegates who attended, all of those who presented papers, and the editors of CMC . We hope to see you all at the next York Deviancy Conference in 2013!",,,"Winlow, S.; University of YorkUnited Kingdom",,,,,,,,17416590,,,,English,Crime Media Cult.,Editorial,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84864466789

These attempts to withdraw from the perceived dangers of urban areas are also predicated on the pursuit of a neighbourhood ideal, and freedom from danger is usually central to this ideal. This paper critically reconsiders these propositions by examining news reports and media narratives surrounding the nature of homicidal violence occurring within such developments. We have analysed fifty news reports from the last decade that address murder committed inside gated communities. In our analysis of these reports we suggest that attempts to neutralise danger in high crime societies are by no means guaranteed-even via the most strenuous efforts at deploying walls, gates and guards. Building on the arguments of Low (2003) and Zedner (2003), we suggest that demands for security are not only unending but that an outward-facing orientation that positions risk outside gated neighbourhoods is a denial of the continued danger of intimate and other forms of violence within communities and households behind gates. In this context the move to enclosure is more than a pragmatic attempt to defend against threat; it appears to reflect the impotence of efforts associated with addressing deep ontological insecurities. Studies continue to record high levels of fear in gated developments, and highly gendered risks of violence continue to be a part of the social reality of the segregated neighbourhood. © 2012 The Author(s).",fear of crime; gated communities; homicide; segregation; social inequality,,,,,,,,,"Agnew, R., (2004) Violence: From Theory to Research, pp. 37-50. , Zahn M.A. Brownstein H.H.

The history of feminist perspectives is summarised and claims are asserted that these are the most successful developments in criminology of the second half of the 20th century. A number of cautions and criticisms are suggested, followed by several outstanding examples of recent scholarship and finally some ideas of blue sky thinking and proposals of areas which may be developed further in the future. © 2012 The Author(s).",feminism; gender gap; history of criminology; public policy,,,,,,,,,"Adler, F., (1975) Sisters in Crime, , New York: McGraw Hill; Britton, D., Feminism in criminology: Engendering the outlaw (2000) Annals of the American Academy of Political Science, 571, pp. 57-76; Brown, J., Heidensohn, F., (2000) Gender and Policing, , Basingstoke, UK: Palgrave; Carlen, P., (2002) Women and Punishment, , Cullompton, UK: Willan Publishing; Chesney-Lind, M., Patriarchy, crime and justice: Feminist criminology (2006) Feminist Criminology, 1, pp. 6-26; Cohen, S., Taylor, L., (1975) Deviance and Control in Europe, , Bianchi H.

Drawing on interviews with and writings by David, I suggest that his narrated identity was central to his violence. The ways in which he conjured himself, his personal and political situation, and despised others, animated his felt compulsion to do harm. In David's story he simultaneously asserted (1) the license to harm and thus triumph over a depersonalized enemy and (2) harm's inevitability. A narrative approach can explain the particulars of crime including its particular seductions. © 2012 The Author(s).",mass murder; metaphor; narrative; violence,,,,,,,,,"Agar, M., Hobbs, J.R., Interpreting discourse: Coherence and the analysis of ethnographic interviews (1982) Discourse Processes, 5, pp. 1-32; Agnew, R., Storylines as a neglected cause of crime (2006) Journal of Research in Crime and Delinquency, 43 (2), pp. 119-147; Agnew, R., Foundation for a general strain theory of crime and delinquency (1992) Criminology, 30, pp. 47-87; Bandura, A., (1973) Aggression: A Social Learning Analysis, , Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice-Hall; Beck, A.T., (1979) Cognitive Therapy of Depression, , New York: Guilford; Beneke, T., (1982) Men on Rape, , New York: St. Martin's Press; Bourgois, P., (2003) In Search of Respect, , 2nd edition.

In response to this phenomenon, Pennsylvania District Attorney Skumanick threatened to bring child pornography charges against teenagers who had been caught sexting and who refused to attend a gender-based 're-education' program designed to teach them about its dangers. Three girls refused the ultimatum, resulting in Miller v. Mitchell [2010], the first case to challenge the constitutionality of prosecuting teens for their digital sexual expression. This article critically considers dominant and intersecting cultural and legal narratives about sexting and troubles the predominant construction of teenage female sexters as dupes of the 'pornification' of a generation and as 'self-sexually exploiting.' The cultural and legal disavowal of girls' narratives about digital sexual expression is considered through Judith Butler's poststructural analysis of sexuality, speech and censorship. Drawing on two online studies of sexting, contributions to an online forum on the topic, and third-wave feminist writings on a generational re-envisioning of risk, respectability and privacy, I argue that that the foreclosure of the 'domain of the sayable' within which girls seek to speak works paradoxically to further render them fetishized sexual objects, thus engendering the very harm that criminal law seeks to remedy. © 2012 The Author(s).",'sexting'; censorship; child pornography; digital sexual expression; teenage girls' sexual subjectivity,,,,,,,,,"Sexting: New, dangerous teen trend-a new, dangerous trend is growing among teenagers (2008) ABC 7 News, , www.wjla.com/news/stories/0508/520195.html, ABC 7 News May 15 accessed October 12, 2009; Adler, A., The perverse law of child pornography (2001) Columbia Law Review, 101, pp. 209-273; Albury, K., Lumby, C., Introduction: Children, young people, sexuality and the media (2010) Media International Australia, (135), pp. 56-59; Arcabascio, C., Sexting and teenagers: OMG R U going 2 jail (2010) Richmond Journal of Law and Technology, 16 (3), pp. 1-42; Barbieri, A., You don't know what sexting is?

One group in particular, the clandestine Earth Liberation Front (ELF), has targeted ski resorts, genetic research labs, SUV dealerships, and forestry buildings, leading James Jarboe of the FBI to declare the ELF the ""number one"" domestic terrorist threat facing the USA. This article analyses the social construction of the ""ecoterrorist threat"" in the pages of the New York Times. Various stakeholders-including ELF spokespersons, moderate environmentalists, corporate interests, and state agencies-have sought to influence the way that media covers the ELF. Ultimately, much to the chagrin of ELF spokespersons, discourses of ecoterrorism have normalized in mainstream media, which regularly frames the spokespersons and activists as ""dangerous clowns."" In turn, this coverage has prevented the expression of the ELF's ideology, foreclosing the potential for the mainstream media to represent as legitimate the concerns of the ELF. I argue that blame for this failure rests in part with certain implications of the ELF's organizational strategy of ""leaderless resistance,"" which-unlike civil disobedience movements of the past-is predicated on having its actors remain unsympathetically faceless and nameless. © 2012 The Author(s).",Earth Liberation Front; eco-terrorism; radical environmentalism; terrorism,,,,,,"Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada, SSHRC

In Rebeyrolle's Le Cyclope, control over emergence is achieved in and through creation. As such this French painter's work attempts to show a way out of the predominant late modern desire for and will to sovereignty which is all about the radical, relentless and unrelenting flight from law and code. Such a radical and absolute imaginary, it is argued here, is bound to strand itself in paradox, and, ultimately, in the loss of all 'control over emergence'.

Urban music (such as rap from the United States) can be understood as generating both 'respectable fears' and 'subcultural capital', appealing to youthful consumers who are seduced by its ostensibly transgressive character. This appeal is linked to the urban communities which incubated and popularised both the music and the 'street culture' of its underprivileged population. The wisdom has followed that the more 'ghetto' the music, the greater its ability to court controversy and generate record sales. Interestingly, the latest generation of UK urban artistes has bucked this trend, eschewing violent imagery and metaphor, courting a 'mainstream' aesthetic and actively referencing 'respectable' routes to inclusion such as engaging with education and running small businesses. This paper reflects on British 'grime' music, demonstrating that new media and music industry democratisation can alter the manner by which crime and street culture are commodified. It argues that where there is a perception of threat connected to street-level urban music authored by those with supposed links to criminality, the lines between real crime and its mediated representation can become blurred. The authorities and the music industry may respond by effectively criminalising and excluding an entire genre. In the case of UK urban music, artistes have adopted a strategy to succeed within the mainstream industry which, as opposed to US rappers, involves muting their links to street culture. © 2012 The Author(s).",commodification of crime; cultural criminology; grime; hip-hop; new media; street culture,,,,,,,,,"Anderson, E., (1999) Code of the Street: Decency, Violence, and the Moral Life of the Inner City, , New York, NY: Norton & Co; (2003) Garage Star Stabbed in Cyprus, , http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/3055770.stm, BBC News accessed 21 April 2011; (2006) Megaman's Controversial Career, , http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/4481112.stm, BBC News accessed 20 April 2011; Bradley, L., (2001) Bass Culture: When Reggae Was King, , London: Penguin; Chang, J., Future shock (2004) Village Voice; Chang, J., (2005) Can't Stop Won't Stop: A History of the Hip-Hop Generation, , London: Ebury; Cohen, S., (1972) Folk Devils and Moral Panics, , London: Routledge; Diehl, M., Spinning in the grave (2000) Vibe Magazine; Devereaux, A., 'What chew know about down the hill?'

While most moral panic researchers are critical, humanist, interpretivist, interventionist and qualitative, this paper highlights ten areas of productive dispute within and around the meaning of moral panic theory's 'common sense'. Such diversity of interpretation creates multiple possibilities for convergent and divergent theorization and research within a supposedly singular conceptual framework. This lack of closure and consequent diversity of political standpoints, intellectual perspectives and fields of empirical focus, rather than representing the weakness of the concept of moral panic, reflects and contributes to its successful diffusion, escalation and innovation. © 2011 The Author(s).",audience effects; deviancy amplification; folk devils; media; moral panic; regulation,,,,,,,,,"Beck, U., (1992) Risk Society: Towards A New Modernity, , London: Sage; Cohen, S., (1972) Folk Devils and Moral Panics, , St Albans, UK: Paladin; Cohen, S., (2002) Folk Devils and Moral Panics: The Creation of the Mods and Rockers, , (3rd ed.).

This work evoked Mills's Sociological Imagination: the placing of individual problems as public issues, the relation of the individual to his or her particular time and social structure, and the effect of social dynamics on the psychological and psychodynamics on the social. The sociological imagination is not a constant but is greatly enhanced at times of change: it is this imagination which engenders transformative politics. Such an analysis clearly demands placing both human actors and reactors, in this instance, 'deviants' and moral panickers, in structure and historical time and to examine both the immediate and deep roots of their behaviour. There is a tendency in these neo-liberal times to view moral panics as simple mistakes in rationality generated perhaps by the mass media or rumour. In this process any link between the individual and the social structure, between historical period and social conflict, is lost. In particular the peculiar 'rational irrationality' of moral panics is obfuscated, the link between social structure and individual belief diminished, and attempts to utilize moral panics to stymie social change and transformative politics obscured. © 2011 The Author(s).",1960s; drugs; high-profile cases; moral indignation; moral panic; ressentiment,,,,,,,,,"Becker, H.S., (1963) Outsiders, , New York: The Free Press; Becker, H.S., (1964) The Other Side, pp. 1-6. , Becker H.S., ed.

It examines the way that conservative politicians and media commentators have appropriated the accusation that they are fuelling moral panic as proof that they are actively engaged in a fight for morality. It contends that moral panic theorists need to use their knowledge of how moral panics work in order to engage in strategic interventions into public debate and policy. It concludes with a call for scholars working on specific issues in the field to apply their research and redouble their efforts to ensure that evidence-based research is heard and understood. © 2011 The Author(s).",asylum seekers; media; moral panic; scandal; sexting; sexualization of children; sport,,,,,,,,,"Albury, K., Lumby, C., Introduction: Children, young people, sexuality and the media (2010) Media International Australia, 135, pp. 56-60; Altheide, D., Moral panic: From sociological concept to public discourse (2009) Crime, Media, Culture, 5 (1), pp. 79-99; Bialik, C., (2009) Which Is Epidemic-Sexting or Worrying about It?, , http://online.wsj.com/article/SB123913888769898347.html?mod=djemnumbers, Available at; Bolt, A., It's time to panic (2004) Herald Sun, p. 19; Brown, W., (1995) States of Injury: Power and Freedom in Late Modernity, , Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press; Critcher, C., (2003) Moral Panics and the Media, , Buckingham, UK: Open University Press; Cumming, Children's rights, children's voices, children's technology, children's sexuality (2009) Youth, Sexuality, Technology, , http://www.yorku.ca/cummingp/research.html, Paper given at a joint session of the Association for Research in Cultures of Young People (ARCYP) and the Association of Canadian College and University Teachers of English (ACCUTE) at the Congress of the Humanities and Social Sciences, Carleton University, Ottawa. 26May.

To this end, a model for the comparative analysis of discursive changes over time, and between different discursive fields, is outlined. The model consists of three steps: (1) mapping general trends in news reporting; (2) analysing thematical relations in full-text news articles; and (3) conducting closer qualitative readings of news articles indicated to be of specific importance in the first two steps. Results from the presented case study-in which news reporting on benefit fraud in Sweden and the United Kingdom is analysed using the outlined model-suggest that there is a close relationship between moral panic discourse and moral regulation discourse. Using different strategies to construct social relations and deviant subjectivities through moralizing articulations, momentary outbursts of moral panics, and the more common, routine, forms of moral regulation, draw and depend upon each other to organize consensus and the management of risks in processes of discursive legitimization. © 2011 The Author(s).",benefit cheating; moral panic; moral regulation; news discourse; welfare fraud,,,,,,,,,"Brush, L.D., Worthy widows, welfare cheats: Proper womanhood in expert needs talk about single mothers in the United States, 1900 to 1988 (1997) Gender and Society, 11 (6), pp. 720-746; Bunyan, N., Disability benefits cheat caught on camera playing rounds of golf (2009) Daily Telegraph; Carlbom, M., Swedes collect 10 billion by cheating (2007) Dagens Nyheter, p. 9; Chunn, D.E., Gavigan, S.A.M., Welfare law, welfare fraud and the moral regulation of the 'never deserving' poor (2004) Social & Legal Studies, 13 (2), pp. 219-243; Cohen, S., (1972) Folk Devils and Moral Panics: The Creation of the Mods and Rockers, , London: MacGibbon & Kee; Cohen, S., Young, J., (1973) The Manufacture of News: Social Problems, Deviance and the Mass Media, , London: Constable; Corrigan, P., Sayer, D., (1985) The Great Arch: English State Formation As Cultural Revolution, , Oxford: Blackwell; Critcher, C., Widening the focus: Moral panics as moral regulation (2009) British Journal of Criminology, 49 (1), pp. 17-34; Dalrymple, T., How to be a modern citizen: Cheat, lie, self-destruct and be anti-social (2003) The Times; Edler, D., Rosvall, M., (2010) The Map Generator Software Package, , http://www.mapequation.org, Available at; Esping-Andersen, G., (1990) The Three Worlds of Welfare Capitalism, , Cambridge: Polity; Cheating Sweden (2005) Expressen Expressen, p. 2; Fraser, N., Gordon, L., A genealogy of dependency: Tracing a keyword of the U.S. welfare state (1994) Signs, 19 (2), pp. 309-326; (2007) Vad Kostar Felen?

After a brief discussion of the political economy of alcohol regulation, the focus shifts to the culture-of-fear thesis. Four writers (Glassner, Altheide, Furedi and Bauman) are interrogated for what they have to say about the culture of fear. Examined are its definition and manifestations; its historical genesis; its key agents and their motivations; how the culture of fear is constructed and disseminated; and its implications for governmental action and public attitudes. Six propositions are identified as constituting a consensus about the political economy of the culture of fear: (1) a safer society produces paradoxically more fear; (2) this fear is different from previous types of fear; (3) fear is symbolically constructed; (4) the media and popular culture are vital to sustaining fear; (5) fear distorts and misrecognizes social realities; (6) fear generates hostility to outsiders. Such a perspective revisits the original project of radical criminology. It is argued that moral panics and moral regulation analysis should be informed by the adherence of political economy to the importance of historical change, seeing society as a totality, insisting on morality as a focus and position, and through a sustained commitment to praxis. © 2011 The Author(s).",culture of fear; moral panics; moral regulation; political economy,,,,,,,,,"Altheide, D.L., (2002) Creating Fear: News and the Construction of Crisis, , New York: Aldine de Gruyter; Bauman, Z., (2006) Liquid Fear, , Cambridge: Polity; Bauman, Z., (2007) Liquid Times: Living in An Age of Uncertainty, , Cambridge: Polity; Beck, U., (1992) Risk Society Revisited: Towards A New Modernity, , London: Sage; Bourke, J., (2006) Fear: A Cultural History, , London: Virago; Caporaso, J.A., Levine, D.P., (1992) Theories of Political Economy, , Cambridge: Cambridge University Press; Corrigan, P., Sayer, D., (1985) The Great Arch: English State Formation As Cultural Revolution, , Oxford: Basil Blackwell; Critcher, C., Widening the focus: Moral panics as moral regulation (2009) British Journal of Criminology, 49 (1), pp. 17-35; Critcher, C., (2011) Moral Panic and the Politics of Anxiety, pp. 171-189. , Hier S., ed.

This article reports the results of a study designed to examine whether a social psychological approach to moral panic can (a) theorize the content as well as process of moral panic, and (b) understand both the cause and the impact of this response. This approach was tested in relation to the topic of asylum seekers. The research was based on a qualitative analysis of 120 newspaper articles, 8 focus groups with members of the host community and 25 semi-structured interviews with people who have sought asylum in the United Kingdom. A theoretical framework of social representations and social identity theory was used to explore psychological processes that may underpin host receptivity to moral panic discourse about asylum seekers and the impact such a moral panic may have on those labelled as 'folk devils'. Results indicated that social psychological processes are one of the contributory factors to host receptivity to moral panic, and strategies adopted by 'folk devils' to cope with stigmatized group membership were identified. Implications of the findings for future moral panic research are discussed. © 2011 The Author(s).",asylum seekers; moral panic; social identity; social representations; thematic analysis,,,,,,,,,"Abric, J.C., Specific processes of social representations (1996) Papers on Social Representations, 5 (1), pp. 77-80; Attride-Stirling, J., Thematic networks: An analytic tool for qualitative research (2001) Qualitative Research, 1 (3), pp. 385-405; Barclay, A., Bowes, A., Ferguson, I., Sim, D., Valenti, M., Fard, S., MacIntosh, S., (2003) Asylum Seekers in Scotland, , www.scotland.gov.uk/library5/social/asis-00.asp, Edinburgh: Scottish Executive Social Research.

UK military deaths from the war in Afghanistan have now reached over 300 and media sources have begun speculating as to which entry point is likely to replace Wootton Bassett when RAF Lyneham closes in August 2011. Our purpose in this paper is to explore the 'public performance' and 'witnessing' of these events through two 'lenses': the literal via photography and the theoretical by way of victimology. Our intention is to situate ourselves as visual, critical, and certainly not neutral, witnesses. In so doing, we wish to use pictures taken by the photographer Stuart Griffiths to propose three cultural trends that our witnessing of his pictures of Wootton Bassett suggests. In so doing we present three themes that we think are identifiable within these photographs: the compression of private and public grief; gothicism and the emergence of 'dark tourism'; and displays of resistance. By way of conclusion we discuss the implications of this analysis for victimology. © SAGE Publications 2011.",cultural victimology; documentary photography; soldier as victim; witnessing,,,,,,,,,"Aldous, J., (2009) Wounded, , London: BBC; Aradau, C., The perverse politics of four-letter words: Risk and pity in the securitisation of human trafficking (2004) Millennium: Journal of International Studies, 33 (2), pp. 251-277; Barthes, R., (1981) Camera Lucida, , New York: Hill & Wang; Beck, U., (2009) World at Risk, , Cambridge: Polity; Bolt, N., Betz, D., Azari, J., Propaganda of the deed 2008 (2008) Whitehall Report 3-08, , www.rusi.org; Bourke, J., (1999) An Intimate History of Killing: Face-to-Face Killing in Twentieth-Century Warfare, , London: Granta Publications; Christie, N., (1986) From Crime Policy to Victim Policy, , Fattah EA., ed.

Supporters of the legislation are concerned that it is being portrayed as a 'villains' charter' which benefits only the least deserving in society. This article analyses the newspaper frames that have been applied to landmark events involving the HRA, while also giving an insight into run-of-the-mill reporting. The findings suggest that the framing is more subtle and more nuanced than the 'villains' charter' epithet suggests. Focusing on broadsheet coverage of the HRA when the legislation came into force in England and Wales, it will be shown how the coverage on this occasion revealed some striking ideological differences. On the other hand, considering another milestone in the rights debate, the introduction of the controversial Identity Card scheme, it is apparent that the issue attracted a unanimous press, even if the discussion on that occasion tended to be couched in the language of civil liberties rather than that of human rights. Finally, considering tabloid coverage of a landmark ruling by the Appellate Committee of the House of Lords, the article considers who qualifies as a worthy victim in tabloid narratives about the HRA. © SAGE Publications 2011.",framing; Human Rights Act; national press; storytelling,,,,,,,,,"Amos, M., Problems with the Human Rights Act 1998 and how to remedy them: Is a Bill of Rights the answer?

Wright Street, Urbana, IL 61801, United States","Over the past decade, CBS's hit television show CSI: Crime Scene Investigation has been characterized as novel and innovative, as one of the first times forensic science was made palatable to a popular audience. Because of its subject matter and its popularity, the show has also sparked debates about the effects of scientific representations. In this essay, I contend that both CSI and its potential effects would be better understood as part of a longer genealogy, one that accounts for debates concerning the real and the representational in American scientific detective fiction. Using a mixed methods approach from literature and science studies, I contextualize CSI via several other cultural 'texts': American scientific detective fiction (1909-1919) and a historical newspaper archive concerning anxieties about fictional portrayals of scientific detective work (1894-1935). By triangulating CSI and its effects with earlier representations of scientific detective work and their uptake in print news media, I draw attention to similarities between historical and contemporary debates: the relative worth of the real and the representational, the role of the media in identifying and/or constructing American anxiety about forensic science and detective work, the relative authority of (forensic) science and the police, and the differing standards of judgment for science and law. © SAGE Publications 2011.",CSI effect; forensic science; literature and science; scientific detective fiction,,,,,,,,,"Balmer, E., MacHarg, W., (1910) The Achievements of Luther Trant, , Boston: Small & Maynard; Balmer, E., MacHarg, W., The man higher up (1930) Amazing Stories; Blumenthal, J., Law and social science in the twenty-first century (2002) Southern California Interdisciplinary Law Journal, 12 (1), pp. 1-53; Cather, K., The CSI Effect: Fake TV and its impact on jurors in criminal cases (2004) Prosecutor; Cavender, G., Deutsch, S.K., CSI and moral authority: The police and science (2007) Crime, Media, Culture, 3, p. 67; Stage detective is popular type (1906) Chicago Daily Tribune, p. 17; Cole, S., Dioso-Villa, R., CSI and its effects: Media, juries, and the burden of proof (2007) New England Law Review, 41, pp. 435-470; Cole, S., Dioso-Villa, R., Investigating the 'CSI Effect' effect: Media and litigation crisis in criminal law (2009) Stanford Law Review, 61 (6), pp. 1335-1373; Deutsch, S.K., Cavender, G., CSI and forensic realism (2008) Journal of Criminal Justice and Popular Culture, 15 (1), pp. 32-53; Dowler, K., Fleming, T., Muzzatti, S., Constructing crime: Media, crime, and popular culture (2006) Canadian Journal of Criminology and Criminal Justice, 48 (6), pp. 837-850; Foster, K., Huber, P., (1997) Judging Science: Scientific Knowledge and the Federal Courts, , Cambridge, MA: MIT Press; Ghoshray, S., Untangling the CSI effect in criminal jurisprudence: Circumstantial evidence, reasonable doubt, and jury manipulation (2007) New England Law Review, 41, p. 533; Goddard, C., Scientific crime detection laboratories in Europe, Part 1 (1930) American Journal of Police Science, 1 (1), pp. 13-37; Golan, T., (2004) Laws of Men and Laws of Nature: The History of Scientific Expert Testimony in England and America, , Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press; Grost, M.K., (2008) Scientific Detectives, , http://mikegrost.com/moffett.htm#Scientific, consulted February 2011; Hall, M., Frank Morgan and Gwili Andre in a fantastic tale revealing clever scientific detective methods (1932) New York Times, p. 18; Harrington, E.B., Nation, identity and the fascination with forensic science in Sherlock Holmes and CSI (2007) International Journal of Cultural Studies, 10 (3), pp. 365-382; Huey, L., 'I've seen this on CSI': Criminal investigators' perceptions about the management of public expectations in the field (2010) Crime, Media, Culture, 6 (1), pp. 49-68; Jasanoff, S., (1997) Science at the Bar: Science and Technology in American Law, , Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press; Johnson-Mcgrath, J., Witness for the prosecution: Science versus crime in twentieth-century America (1998) Legal Studies Forum, 22, pp. 183-199; Krasner, L., The psychology of mystery (1983) American Psychologist, 38 (5), pp. 578-582; Lawson, T., Before the verdict and beyond the verdict: The 'CSI Infection; Within modern criminal jury trials (2009) Loyola University Chicago Law Journal, 41. , http://ssrn.com/abstract=1372703; Levine, G., (1993) Realism and Representation: Essays on the Problem of Realism in Relation to Science, Literature, and Culture, , Madison: University of Wisconsin Press; Littlefield, M., (2011) The Lying Brain: Lie Detection in Science and Science Fiction, , Ann Arbor: University of Michigan Press; Mann, M., 'The CSI effect': Better jurors through television and science?

Public interest and concern has been enormous. But no images of or interviews with loverboys have appeared in the media. This article examines the 10-year-long history of the phenomenon as a classic moral panic constructed by the media, social workers and politicians. Our analysis also seeks to get behind the media representations, using discovery research methods from urban ethnography to show that a subculture has grown in the world of prostitution where this recruiting method is used. Our dual track investigatory approach demonstrates that both developments-the rise of a moral panic and the emergence of a new type of prostitution-are inexorably intertwined. © SAGE Publications 2011.",moral panic; pimping; urban ethnography; youth subculture,,,,,,,,,"Ben-Yehuda, N., (2009) British Journal of Criminology, pp. 1-3; Best, J., (1995) Images of Issues: Typifying Contemporary Social Problems, , New York: Aldine De Gruyter; Best, J., (1999) Random Violence.

It assesses how the series compares and contrasts with other cop shows such as The Sweeney and The Wire and questions whether the fictional representations of police and society in Life on Mars are indicative of what criminologists know about police culture from the 1970s onwards. The article also explores what this complex programme means for the general public with their anxieties about the efficacy of criminal justice agencies in a post-industrial society. The piece then addresses the representations of police occupational cultures depicted during the series (including elements of officer corruption, sexism, racism and homophobia) and how these help us to understand the changes in policing that occurred between 1973 and the 2000s. It suggests that, despite its ambiguities, Life on Mars in many ways acts as a paean to 1970s policing by appearing to reject the 'politically correct' strictures that surround policing in the 21st century. © SAGE Publications 2011.",cultures; images; Life on Mars; media; police,,,,,,,,,"(2009) The Real Life on Mars, , BBC4; Billig, M., (2005) Beyond A Joke: The Limits of Humour, pp. 25-44. , Lockyer S.

This paper examines the complex politics of watching and being watched in relation to this scheme, using some lines of contemporary surveillance theory as a theoretical frame. The understanding of surveillance has lately faced a fundamental change, since devices and practices which previously were available only for the authorities are ever more often accessible for anyone. The paper explores the discursive framings by which the authorities have justified the program. It brings up complex issues dealing with voluntary participation and amateur verification and discusses the politics of responsibilization that relate to the border watch program. The Texas Virtual Border Watch Program is evaluated critically also in relation to the contemporary securitization of the Other. Finally, the symbolic value of border control is highlighted and the concept of 'patriotic voyeurism' is brought up in order to understand the motivations of the volunteer observers. © The Author(s) 2011.",amateur surveillance; Internet; responsibilization; securitization; US-Mexico border,,,,,,,,,"Aas, K.F., 'Getting ahead of the game': Border technologies and the changing space of governance (2005) Global Surveillance and Policing: Borders, Security, Identity, , Zureik E, Salter MB (eds) Cullompton, UK: Willan Publishing; Ackleson, J., Constructing security on the U.S.-Mexico border (2005) Political Geography, 24 (2), pp. 165-84; Adamson, F.B., Crossing borders: International migration and national security (2006) International Security, 31 (1), pp. 165-99; Albrechtslund, A., Dubbeld, L., The plays and arts of surveillance: Studying surveillance as entertainment (2005) Surveillance and Society, 3 (2-3), pp. 216-21; Allen, M., 'See you in the city!'

It has undermined the moral order and shaken the delicate nerves of Israeli society, which lives in the shadow of the Holocaust. Drawing principally on Israeli newspaper coverage, the study examines the dynamics of social discourse among policymakers, the press and pressure groups. The analysis shows that initial formulations of moral panic derived from a profound concern about changes in the social and moral order of society due to immigration. Moreover, conceptually situated within theorizations of moral risk, this moral panic was a temporary rupture in processes of moral regulation and served governing agents, which increased social control by constructing risks and dangers. © The Author(s) 2011.",immigrants; moral panic; neo-Nazi; skinheads; social control; youth gangs,,,,,,,,,"Ajzenstadt, M., Moral panic and neo-liberalism: The case of single mothers on welfare in Israel (2009) British Journal of Criminology, 49, pp. 68-87; Al-Haj, M., (2004) Immigration and Ethnic Formation in A Deeply Divided Society: The Case of the 1990s Immigrants from the Former Soviet Union in Israel, , Leiden, Netherlands: Brill; Al-Haj, M., Leshem, E., (2000) Immigrants from the Former Soviet Union in Israel: Ten Years Later - A Research Report, , Haifa, Israel: Centre for Multiculturalism and Educational Research, Haifa University; Altheide, D.L., Moral panic: From sociological concept to public discourse (2009) Crime Media Culture, 5, pp. 79-99; Altschul, M., Israel's Law of Return and the debate of altering, repealing, or maintaining its present language (2003) University of Illinois Law Review, 20, pp. 1345-1372; Back, L., When hate speaks the language of love Paper Presented at the Social Movement Studies Conference; Becker, H.S., (1963) Outsiders: Studies in the Sociology of Deviance, , London: Free Press; Ben-Yehuda, N., Foreword: Moral panics - 36 years on (2009) British Journal of Criminology, 49 (1), pp. 1-3; Brand, J.E., Greenberg, B.S., Commercial in the classroom: The impact of Channel One advertising (1994) Journal of Advertising Research, 34, pp. 18-27; Burns, R., Crawford, C., School shooting, the media and public fear: Ingredients for a moral panic (1999) Crime Law and Social Change, 32 (3), pp. 147-168; Campbell, A., The search for authenticity: An exploration of an online skinhead newsgroup (2006) New Media and Society, 8 (2), pp. 269-294; Cohen, S., (1972) Folk Devils and Moral Panics: The Creation of the Mods and Rockers, , St Albans, UK: Paladin; Cohen, Y., Kogan, I., Immigrants from the former Soviet Union in Israel and Germany in the 1990s (2007) European Sociological Review, 23 (2), pp. 155-168; Corte, U., Edwards, B., White Power music and the mobilization of racist social movements (2008) Music and Arts in Action, 1, pp. 4-20; Critcher, C., Media, government, and moral panic: The politics of paedophilia in Britain 2000-1 (2002) Journalism Studies, 3 (4), pp. 521-535; Critcher, C., Widening the focus: Moral panics as moral regulation (2009) British Journal of Criminology, 49 (1), pp. 17-34; Cromer, G., Children from good homes: Moral panics about middle-class delinquency (2004) British Journal of Criminology, 44, pp. 391-400; Dor, D., (2001) Newspaper under the Influence, , Tel Aviv: Babel (Hebrew); Earl, J., Martin, A., McCarthy, J.D., Soule, S.A., The use of newspapers data in the study of collective action (2004) Annual Review of Sociology, 30, pp. 65-80; Fairclough, N.L., Wodak, R., Critical discourse analysis (1997) Discourse studies: A multidisciplinary introduction.

This paper is an attempt to understand the images and why so many critics sought to locate the origins of the cruelty in US popular culture. Internet pornography, reality television and campus humiliation rituals are among the sources said to have inspired the brutality. While such explanations are more than plausible, they ignore the much longer history of violent representation that figures in the European classical art tradition, which all too frequently has justified imperial ambition, colonial conquest, and belief in racial superiority, while eroticizing bodies in pain. In the rush to situate the images well within the terms of a lowly popular culture a fuller understanding of their visual power is lost, as is their place in the cultural politics of torture more generally. The paper begins by outlining influential understandings of photography and atrocity images, before considering the differing explanations of the abuse. In taking a cue from recent scholarship in 'trauma studies', the argument is that human suffering should not be reduced to a set of aesthetic concerns, but is fundamentally bound up with the politics of testimony and memory - issues that have been pursued in some of the images produced after Abu Ghraib and which are discussed in the final section of the paper. © The Author(s) 2011.",Abu Ghraib; aesthetics; art; ethics; representation; suffering; torture,,,,,,,,,"Andén-Papadopoulos, K., The Abu Ghraib torture photographs: News frames, visual culture, and the power of images (2008) Journalism, 9 (1), pp. 5-30; Apel, D., Torture culture: Lynching photographs and the images of Abu Ghraib (2005) Art Journal, pp. 88-100; Arendt, H., (1963) Eichmann in Jerusalem: A Report on the Banality of Evil, , Harmondsworth: Penguin; Bayoumi, M., Disco inferno: Enlisting music in ""torture Lite"" (2005) The Nation, 381 (22), pp. 32-4; Bennett, J., (2005) Empathic Vision: Affect, Trauma and Contemporary Art, , Stanford, CA: Stanford University Press; Berger, D., Regarding the imprisonment of others: Prison abuse photographs and social change (2007) International Journal of Communication, 1, pp. 210-237; Berger, J., ""Che"" Guevara (1967) Selected Essays and Articles: The Look of Things, , Harmondsworth : Penguin; Blanford, N., Iraqi Artists Depict Anger over Abu Ghraib (2004) Christian Science Monitor, , http://www.csmonitor.com/2004/0615/p07s01-woiq.html, 15 June 2004; Boltanski, L., (1999) Distant Suffering: Morality, Media and Politics, , Cambridge: Cambridge University Press; Bourke, J., (1999) An Intimate History of Killing: Face-to-Face Killing in Twentieth Century Warfare, , London: Granta; Bourke, J., Sexy snaps (2005) Index on Censorship, 34 (1), pp. 39-45; Boxer, S., Torture Incarnate, and Propped on a Pedestal (2004) New York Times, , http://www.nytimes.com/2004/06/13/weekinreview/13boxe.html, 13 June 2004; Brown, M., (2009) The Culture of Punishment: Prison, Society, and Spectacle, , New York: New York University Press; Butler, J., (2009) Frames of War, , London: Verso; Carrabine, E., (2008) Crime, Culture and the Media, , Cambridge : Polity; Chouliaraki, L., The media as moral education: Mediation and action (2008) Media, Culture and Society, 30 (6), pp. 831-52; Cohen, S., Neither Honesty Nor Hypocrisy: The Legal Reconstruction of Torture (2006) The Politics of Crime Control: Essays in Honour of David Downes, , Newburn, T. and P.

The relationship between media, crime, and justice is under-examined in countries other than the United States and Britain and the relationship between media and criminal justice policy support remains less than fully understood in all locales. In response, an examination of a media- policy relationship in a Western democracy not previously studied was conducted. Based on data from an October 2005 national telephone survey of Trinidad and Tobago residents, this study measured support for punitive and preventive criminal justice policies in association with crime and justice media consumption and worldviews. Multivariate analysis showed that, for Trinidadians, support for punitive policies was significantly related to perceiving television crime dramas as realistic and crime news as accurate. For preventive policy support, the same media factors plus the level of exposure to crime dramas on television were significant. Overall, media were found to play similar but not especially strong roles in support levels for both punitive and preventive criminal justice policies. © The Author(s) 2011.",crime prevention; media influence; public attitudes; punitivism; Trinidad,,,,,,,,,"Altheide, D., (2002) Creating Fear, , New York: Aldine de Gruyter; Applegate, B., (1997) Specifying Public Support for Rehabilitation: A Factorial Survey Approach.

From building designs to cinematic depictions, the visual underpins any understanding of the prison. Using Bakhtin's notion of heteroglossia, it will be shown how the visual elements of prison buildings, both physical and cinematic, obscure a 'programmatic organisation of space'. As such, the prison is akin to a 'phantasmagoria'. Both have visual elements that embrace and encourage an imaginative response, but that also mask a rational core. The term 'Gothic(k)' is developed here to describe those elements of the prison that constitute its 'place-myth'. The prison no longer requires a physical apparatus to project its message or consolidate this place-myth. By drawing upon the Gothic(k) readings of the prison and the analogy of the phantasmagoria, we see how the prison has been fully rendered as a 'system of light'. © The Author(s) 2011.",Bakhtin; phantasmagoria; prison architecture; prison film; uncanny,,,,,,,,,"Abbott, J.H., (1991) The Belly of the Beast, , New York : Vintage; Augé, M., (1995) Non-places: Introduction to An Anthropology of Supermodernity (Trans.

This article analyses interviews with young people from a range of ethnic backgrounds about the Dutch police series Baantjer and Spangen. Very little audience research has been carried out internationally into crime drama and this study aims to develop insight into how viewers watch and interpret police series. The informants interpreted Dutch police series in two different ways.

I specifically explore how the eponymous character of the US television series Dexter integrates conventional face-work and stigma management with 'reverse marking' in order to present an unmarked person. Reverse marking, following Brekhus's (1996) usage, involves perceptually attending to those aspects of identity typically regarded as mundane. I argue the role reverse marking plays in Dexter's performance of identity draws attention to the mundane as the result of 'doing,' grounding a critical reevaluation of the privileged cultural location of unmarkedness or normativity. © The Author(s), 2010.",Deviance; identity; mundanity; television; the unmarked,,,,,,,,,"Barthes, R., (1957) Mythologies, , New York: Hill & Wang; Brekhus, W., Social marking and the mental coloring of identity: Sexual identity construction and maintenance in the United States (1996) Sociological Forum, 11 (3), pp. 497-522; Brekhus, W., A sociology of the unmarked: Redirecting our focus (1998) Sociological Theory, 16 (1), pp. 34-51; Brekhus, W., (2003) Peacocks, Chameleons, Centaurs: Gay Suburbia and the Grammar of Social Identity, , Chicago: University of Chicago Press; Butler, J., (2004) Undoing Gender, , New York: Routledge; Cahill, S.E., Toward a sociology of the person (1998) Sociological Theory, 16 (2), pp. 131-148; Crawley, S., Prioritizing audiences: Exploring the differences between stone butch and transgender selves (2002) Journal of Lesbian Studies, 6 (2), pp. 11-24; Crawley, S., The clothes make the trans: Region and geography in experiences of the body (2008) Journal of Lesbian Studies, 12 (4), pp. 365-379; Ellis, B.E., (1991) American Psycho, , London: Picador; Foucault, M., (1975) Discipline and Punish: The Birth of the Prison, , New York: Vintage Books; Garfinkel, H., (1967) Studies in Ethnomethodology, , Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice-Hall; Goffman, E., (1959) The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life, , New York: Anchor Books; Goffman, E., (1963) Stigma: Notes on the Management of Spoiled Identity, , New York: Touchstone; Goffman, E., (1967) Interaction Ritual, , New York: Anchor Books; Goffman, E., The Arrangement between the Sexes (1977) Theory and Society, 4 (3), pp. 301-331; Grazian, D., The girl hunt: Urban nightlife and the performance of masculinity as collective activity (2007) Symbolic Interaction, 30 (2), pp. 221-243; Haggerty, K.D., Modern serial killers (2009) Crime, Media, Culture, 5 (2), pp. 168-187; Jacobs, J.L., (2002) Hidden Heritage: The Legacy of the Crypto-Jews, , Berkeley, CA: University of California Press; Jarvis, B., Monsters Inc.: Serial killers and consumer culture (2007) Crime, Media, Culture, 3 (3), pp. 326-344; Lindsay, J., (2004) Darkly Dreaming Dexter, , New York: Doubleday; Prosser, J., (1998) Second Skins: The Body Narratives of Transsexuality, , New York: Columbia University Press; Robinson, A., It takes one to know one: Passing and communities of common interest (1994) Critical Inquiry, 20 (4), pp. 715-736; Seltzer, M., (1998) Serial Killers: Death and Life in America's Wound Culture, , London: Routledge; Simpson, P.L., (2000) Psycho Paths: Tracking the Serial Killer Through Contemporary American Film and Fiction, , Carbondale, IL: Southern Illinois University Press; West, C., Fenstermaker, S., Doing difference (1995) Gender & Society, 9 (1), pp. 8-37; West, C., Zimmerman, D., Doing gender (1987) Gender & Society, 1 (2), pp. 125-151; Zerubavel, E., (1997) Social Mindscapes: An Invitation to Cognitive Sociology, , Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press","Force, W.

The hearings culminated in the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, legislation that regulates the accounting industry and imposes prison sentences on executives who lie on their corporations' financial statements. There was extensive media coverage of Enron and the other high-profile corporations and of the congressional hearings into their wrongdoing. In this paper, we analyze the media representations of these matters. We focus on media coverage of the political language that was offered during the hearings, on the media's own characterizations of these events, and on how the coverage represented corporate wrongdoing and its control. Our analysis is in three parts. First, we track the 'bad apples' language that shifted blame from the corporations onto individuals. Second, we consider the angry denunciations from Congress that resemble status degradation ceremonies. Third, we analyze the hearings as representations of the scandal story using a critical dramaturgy. We argue that the hearings became a spectacle that deflected critique from the economy and shored up the legitimacy of the government and the economy. The usage of critical dramaturgy helps us to make sense of criminological research about the public's sensibilities of corporate crime. © The Author(s), 2010.",corporate crime; critical dramaturgy; political news; status degradation ceremony,,,,,,,,,"Allahyari, R.A., The micro-politics of worthy homelessness: Interactive moments in congressional hearings (1997) Sociological Inquiry, 67, pp. 59-71; Bennett, L., (2001) News: The Politics of Illusion, , 4th edition.

Produced in the early 1970s, it expressed the era's wariness of liberal states' potential to abuse power and to violate individual rights in the name of social good. The aversion therapy to which the main character is subjected was not the stuff of fantasy but was familiar to contemporary critics of the penal welfare complex and the covert tactics of the Cold War. ACO resonates anew in the early twenty-first century, as officially sanctioned torture, justified in the so-called Global War on Terrorism (GWOT), provides fresh cause to question what is sacrificed in the name of security. © The Author(s), 2010.",A Clockwork Orange; film; Kubrick; torture,,,,,,,,,"Biderman, A.D., Zimmer, H., (1961) The Manipulation of Human Behavior, , New York: John Wiley & Sons Inc; Brooks, P., The humanities as an export commodity (2008) Profession, 7, pp. 33-39; Canby, V., A Clockwork Orange dazzles the senses and mind (1971) New York Times, , http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res= 9a02e1d61038ef34bc4851dfb467838a669edE, 20 December; Carruthers, S., Past future: The troubled history of Stanley Kubrick's a Clockwork Orange (2001) National Forum: Phi Kappa Phi Journal, 81 (2), pp. 29-34; Ebert, R., Review, a Clockwork Orange (1972) Chicago Sun Times, , http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?aid=/19720211/ reviews/202110301/1023, 11 February; Ebert, R., Review (2007) Rendition, , http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?aid=/20071018/ reviews/710180307; Farber, S., The Old Ultra-Violence (1972) Hudson Review, 25 (2), pp. 287-294; Foucault, M., (1991) Discipline and Punish: The Birth of the Prison, , trans.

In contrast, this article focuses on collective memory and examines the way in which this was drawn on as a resource by republican and loyalist communities in terms of identity and endurance during almost four decades of conflict. These identities were displayed in various commemorations and symbols, including wall murals. During the peace process these murals have been judged officially to be anachronistic, leading to a recent government-funded scheme to remove them, the Reimaging Communities Programme. This article questions the political motivation of this programme. It considers the attempts by people in republican and loyalist areas to come to terms with the peace process by emphasizing traditional symbols of identity, while at the same time reinterpreting them for a new era. Symbols can be the bridge between the past and the future which makes the present tolerable. © The Author(s), 2010.",collective memory; identity; murals; Reimaging Communities Programme; revisionism,,,,,,,,,"The Guide to Re-imaging Communities, , www.artscouncil-ni.org/award/forms/re-image/Reimaging181109.doc, Belfast: Arts Council of Northern Ireland; Anderson, B., (1991) Imagined Communities: Reflections on the Origin and Spread of Nationalism, , London: Verso; (2002) Ardoyne: The Untold Truth, , Ardoyne Commemoration Project Belfast: Beyond the Pale Publications; Bartel, D., Getting in touch with history: The role of historic preservation in shaping collective memories (1996) Qualitative Sociology, 19 (3), pp. 345-364; Bell, D., (2006) Memory, Trauma and World Politics: Reflections on the Relationship between the Past and Present, , Basingstoke, UK: Palgrave Macmillan; Bloomfield, K., (1998) We Will Remember Them: Report of the Northern Ireland Victims Commissioner, , Belfast: Stationery Office; Bradley, L., Bitter tide of violent racial hate recalls the worst of the Troubles (2004) Irish Independent, , 8 August; Bridgman, M., Re-imaging communities (2009) ArtsHub, , http://www.artshub.co.uk/uk/news-article/opinions/visual-arts/ re-imaging-communities-177113, 26 February; Brown, K., 'Our Father Organization': The cult of the Somme and the Unionist 'Golden Age' in modern Ulster loyalist commemoration (2007) Round Table, 96 (393), pp. 707-723; Collins, P., Moore, R., Smyth, M., (1996) Life in Two Enclave Areas in Northern Ireland: A Field Survey in Gobnascale and the Fountain, Derry Londonderry after the Cease-fires, , Derry Londonderry: Templemore Action Research Limited; (2009) Report of the Consultative Group on the Past, , Consultative Group on the Past Belfast: Consultative Group on the Past in Northern Ireland; Conway, B., (2010) Commemoration and Bloody Sunday: Pathways of Memory, , Basingstoke, UK: Palgrave Macmillan; Darby, J., (1998) Scorpions in a Bottle: Conflicting Cultures in Northern Ireland, , London: Minority Rights Publications; Dawson, G., (2007) Making Peace with the Past?

In January 2006, Barraza was arrested as the alleged Mataviejitas (the little old lady killer), a serial killer of elderly women in Mexico City whom police had struggled for two years to apprehend. La Dama del Silencio became la Mataviejitas , and vice versa, more than Juana Barraza became la Mataviejitas. I argue that discourses of criminality and the spectacle of lucha libre intersect within Mexican culture to police and perform the parameters of mexicanidad, reinforcing but also revealing the limits of Mexican masculinity and femininity. This article focuses on this intersection as a potent site for denaturalizing and sestabilizing Mexican masculinity and femininity and redressing the raced, classed, gendered and sexualized limits of mexicanidad and criminality that have served to exclude so many from the rights of full citizenship in Mexico. © The Author(s), 2010.",criminality; cultural studies; lucha libre; mexicanidad; performativity,,,,,,,,,"Balsamo, A.M., (1996) Technologies of the Gendered Body: Reading Cyborg Women, , Durham, NC: Duke University Press; Barrón Cruz, M.G., (2006) El Nudo del Silencio: Tras la Pista de Una Asesina en Serie, la Mataviejitas, , Mexico City: Editorial Océano de México; Bartra, R., (1987) La Jaula de la Melancolía Identidad Y Metamorfosis del Mexicano, , Mexico City: Grijalbo; Brito, L., Puede Barraza tener 27 víctimas (2006) Reforma; Bueno, I., (2006) La Mataviejitas; 'Una Sociópata', Asegura Académica de la UIA, , Dirección de Comunicación Institucional (ed.).

They overstate the problem of crime; put the blame on marginalised cohorts and level heavy criticism against the administration of prisons purportedly for laxity; issue urgent calls for ever-greater reliance on the use of strict imprisonment by the authorities and the adoption of self-policing measures by local communities and private individuals; and either mute or neutralise the attendant hardships prisoners suffer at the hands of the state. Breaking with discourses of rational linearity, whereby distorted perceptions of criminal danger result in punitive reactions, the claim is made that the imagery of crime and punishment helps audiences resolve at the level of symbolic expression contradictions which remain unconsciously insoluble at the level of everyday life. © The Author(s), 2010.",crime; prisons; semiotic aestheticisation; the unconscious; visibility,,,,,,,,,"Banks, M., Spaces of (in)security: Media and fear of crime in a local context (2005) Crime, Media, Culture, 1 (2), pp. 169-187; Bauman, Z., (1997) Postmodernity and Its Discontents, , Cambridge: Polity; Bauman, Z., Social uses of law and order (2000) Criminology and Social Theory, pp. 23-45. , Garland, D. and Sparks, R.

Advertisements using images are becoming more prevalent and rely on complex textual narratives and the CCTV image format to construct crime for public consumption to generate 'tips'. The advertisements capture a narrow range of 'street crime' to the benefit of private business and to the neglect of pervasive and serious conduct affecting the less powerful. The convergence of Crime Stoppers and CCTV surveillance is found to have unanticipated and ironic consequences regarding deterrence and identification, to befit a form of 'counter-law', and to demonstrate potential to harm individuals and visible minorities. Theoretical implications of this analysis for understanding assumptions about the relation between image and the Truth of crime, governance, and surveillance are discussed. © The Author(s), 2010.",assemblage; CCTV; crime; Crime Stoppers; governance; media; social construction; surveillance,,,,,,,,,"Alvesalo, A., Tombs, S., Virta, E., Whyte, D., Re-imagining crime prevention: Controlling corporate crime?

One such response is 'creative crime.' This paper outlines some of the characteristics and defining features of three categories of 'creative crime' - culture jamming, interventionism, and sabotage. In so doing, it identifies a phytological analogy for understanding and articulating the role of creative crime in society and its system of governance. Through a discussion of the possibilities and problems of placing 'creative crime' within the rubric of the various 'branches' of government, or as a rhizome of the same theoretical plant, kudzu is presented as the most appropriate analogy. But whether 'creative crime' serves as an end in itself or as part of a broader movement for change, its contributions to the 'marketplace of ideas' cannot be discounted. © The Author(s), 2010.",creative crime; cultural criminology; culture jamming; interventionism; sabotage,,,,,,,,,"Agnew, R., The cause of animal abuse: A social-psychological analysis (1998) Theoretical Criminology, 2 (2), pp. 177-209; Pieda, A., Delicious mischief: Ann Coulter fed a helping humility (2005) Earth First!, 25 (2), p. 56; Baldwin, J., (1999) Kudzu Cuisine: Festive Cookery to Delight the Adventurous and Intrigue the Skeptics, , Virginia Beach, VA: Suntop Press; Baldwin, J., (2003) Kudzu in America, , Virginia Beach, VA: Suntop Press; Barker, M., Conform or reform?

Synge's The Playboy of the Western World has been oddly neglected in sociology and criminology. This article examines the provenance of the violence around which Playboy's dizzying text swirls, namely, a tragicomic parricide seemingly twice committed. In particular, we ask: is the text plausible? Though Synge's authorial intentions are not open to complete reclamation, we explore first, his self-stated reliance on the actual cases of William Maley and James Lynchehaun and, second, whether the representation(s) of parricide in Playboy more or less accurately reflected the presence and character of parricide at the time the controversial play was being imagined and first performed in 1907. The culture wars and associated media frenzy over the play provide an ever-looming backcloth against which to interpret the meanings of intergenerational violence in a colonial society lurching towards national self-determination. © The Author(s), 2010.",Irish literary culture; J.M.

Its special focus is on techniques and victim-specific attributes that are used in the Finnish crime-appeal programme, Poliisi-TV, to define victims. The data comprise 21 violence vignettes, which are textually and visually analysed from the perspective of dramaturgy. These narratives represent victims of violence as either survivors or victims. The survivors are portrayed as heroic characters who have found inner strength to carry on with their lives after their victimization, while the victims are presented as depressed and traumatized, and their future is pictured as gloomy and unhopeful. The narratives mediate a strong picture of the hetero-normative nuclear family and the victims of violence represented in the programme are middle-aged, middle-class, financially well-off parents. Victims of violence who are outside the parameters of family, such as marginalized alcoholic men and particularly vulnerable victims, are completely missing from the footage. Some major differences among Finnish and Anglo-American media portrayals are pointed out, and internationally comparative crime media research is called for. © The Author(s), 2010.",Crime-appeal programming; Ideal victim; Narrative; Text-analysis; Violence,,,,,,,,,"Aslama, M., (2008) Slogans of Change: Three Outlooks on Finnish Television, , Helsinki: Research Institute, Swedish School of Social Science, University of Helsinki; Bennett, W.L., News as reality TV: Election coverage and the democratization of truth (2005) Critical Studies in Media Communication, 22 (2), pp. 171-177; Berrington, E., Honkatukia, P., An Evil monster and a poor thing: Female violence in the media (2002) Journal of Scandinavian Studies in Criminology and Crime Prevention, 3 (1), pp. 50-72; Bird, E., Dardenne, R.W., News as mythological narrative (1988) Media, Myths, and Narratives: Television and the Press, , J.W.

Imagined as a 'model ghetto' since the Wannsee Conference of January 1942, Theresienstadt was eventually 'beautified' in preparation for a June 1944 visit by representatives of the International Committee of the Red Cross and the Danish government, as well as to serve as the set for a documentary about life in the camp, filmed that same year. In this paper, I draw upon Erving Goffman's (1993/1959) dramaturgy and Pierre Bourdieu's (1990a, 1990b) practice theory to identify various mechanisms of misrepresentation that made possible the adoption of a 'normalizing performativity' within Theresienstadt's carceral space. This theoretical approach serves two purposes. First, it is used to describe the technical details of how the Nazi regime attempted to foster and manage a false impression of Theresienstadt. Second, the performativity of Theresienstadt is argued to offer a compelling frame for understanding contemporary biopolitical life, and therefore is presented as a competing metaphor of 'camp', which Agamben (2000: 44.5) describes as the 'new biopolitical nomos of the planet'. In particular, it is suggested that Agamben's figure of the homo sacer reduced to bare life fails to capture the persistence of human agency and performativity (homo dramaticus) in even the most regimented and brutal conditions. © The Author(s), 2010.",Dramaturgy; Habitus; Holocaust; Homo sacer; Performativity; Theresienstadt,,,,,,,,,"Adler, H.G., (1958) Die verheimlichte Wahrheit: Theresienstädter Dokumente, , T̈bingen: J.C.B.

Through qualitative interviews with 31 members of Canadian police forces, I explore the question of whether police investigative personnel view media representations of their work as negatively influencing public expectations, thereby creating a source of occupational role strain for police officers. What is revealed is that the majority of investigative personnel interviewed have experienced citizen queries and demands attributed to consumption of unrealistic images of police work in television programs. Where a minority of investigators report feelings of frustration due to the role strain associated with having their expert knowledge and work methods questioned, the majority of those interviewed saw such queries as opportunities for educating the public about the realities of policing. © The Author(s), 2010.",CSI effect; Police investigators; Public expectations; Role strain,,,,,,,,,"Brodeur, J.-P., Dupont, B., Knowledge workers or ''knowledge"" workers?

And yet, it is commonplace for the futuristic films of the science fiction genre to take seriously the implications to 'justice' of intensified surveillance in liberal democratic societies faced with different kinds of risk. Filmic representations of 'imagined' technologies for responding to crime, especially those based on identificatory and predictive capacity, are typified in box office successes, such as Minority Report (2002), Paycheck (2003) and A Scanner Darkly (2006). These films may (simply) be entertaining as 'action-packed' science fiction thrillers. But they also create a Baudrillardian hyperreality which allows us to glimpse alternative frameworks of risk management which, ambiguously, reflect both the horror and the hope for systems of 'justice', law enforcement and punishment in a 'risk society'. Through an analysis of these films, and drawing on Barthes's notions of jouissance and the enigmatic, this paper explores the critical, subversive and disruptive possibilities of the simulated worlds of 'Hollywood risk management', paying particular attention to how they work to destabilize and scrutinize the conceptual scope and empirical instantiation of 'risk' as well as challenge its ethico-political meaning in contemporary life. © The Author(s), 2010.",Hyperreality; Jouissance; Risk; Science fiction; The enigmatic,,,,,,,,,"Anderson, D.C., (1995) Crime and the Politics of Hysteria: How the Willie Horton Story Changed American Justice, , New York: Times Books; Asen, R., Seeking the ""Counter"" in Counterpublics (2000) Communication Theory, 10 (4), pp. 424-446; Asen, R., Brouwer, D.C., (2001) Counterpublics and the State, , Albany: State University of New York Press; Ashenden, S., Policing perversion: The contemporary governance of Paedophilia (2002) Cultural Values, 6 (1-2), pp. 197-222; Barthes, R., (1970) S/Z, , Translated by Richard Miller.

We consider the relationship between media reporting and belief in routine DFSA, and look at the ways in which DFSA is presented and received as a legitimate, plausible, and credible threat. As a media story, DFSA shares certain characteristics of the 'crime legend' and the 'moral panic', although it is, this article suggests, more appropriately conceived of as a 'cautionary tale'. The final part of the article outlines the 'cautionary tale' as a paradigm for understanding media coverage. It is the victim and potential victim's behaviour (as opposed to that of a folk devil) that is marginalised in the 'cautionary tale', and the threat is frequently represented as both external and internal to the individual, as resulting from an opportunistic attacker and/or one's own negligent behaviour. © The Author(s), 2009.",Cautionary tale; Crime legend; Drug-facilitated sexual assault; Media; Moral panic,,,,,,,,,"Allison, J.A., Wrightsman, L.S., (1993) Rape: The Misunderstood Crime, , London: Sage; Benedict, H., (1992) The Virgin and the Vamp: How the Press Covers Sex Crimes, , New York: Oxford University Press; Best, J., Horiuchi, G.T., The Razor Blade in the Apple: The Social Construction of Urban Legends (1985) Social Problems, 32 (5), pp. 488-497; Burgess, A., Donovan, P., Moore, S.E.H., Embodying Uncertainty?

The film footage was used to secure convictions for sodomy, and inaugurated a new form of police surveillance of homosexual public sex. In 2008, the visual artist William E. Jones screened the police footage in art galleries around the world, to both critical acclaim and public objection. This article examines the film, both as a prosecutorial artefact and an artwork, to explore what it says about public sex, police surveillance, the criminalization of homosexual practices, visual evidence, and contemporary art. It considers the validity of the public/private distinction as it applies to anonymous sex, it evaluates the probative value of images, the changing nature of surveillance, and the meanings of silence in both criminal procedure and artistic practice. This article argues that the act of transforming traumatic evidence into visual art requires deep ethical examination. Whatever artistic, political or historical contribution may be claimed for this work must be measured against the harm that it does to the film's silent subjects. © The Author(s), 2009.",Art; Evidence; Homosexuality; Public sex; Surveillance,,,,,,,,,"Agee, C., Gayola: Police Professionalization and the Politics of San Francisco's Gay Bars, 1950-1968 (2006) Journal of the History of Sexuality, 15 (3), pp. 462-489; Aldrich, R., Wotherspoon, G., (1992) Gay Perspectives: Essays in Australian Gay Culture, , University of Sydney: Dept. of Economic History; Armstrong, S., Bunker Vision: William Jones (2008) Artillery, p. 45. , January; Barthes, R., (1981) Camera Lucida: Reflections on Photography, , New York: Hill and Wang; Benjamin, W., (1970) Illuminations, , London: Jonathan Cape; Bennett, C., R.

Drawing upon field data from two of our previous ethnographic studies conducted in the North East of England, we hope to make a few basic points about the importance of emotion and memory as constitutive and dynamic components in the core of identity. Focusing on the emotional 'feelings' of humiliation and regret, we will outline how violent incidents or verbal challenges from earlier stages of the individual's life-course can be drawn upon, both directly and indirectly, as motivational and justificatory instruments in potentially violent interactions in the here and now. The intention is to propose what might be important psychosocial elements of Bourdieu's concept of habitus and how an exposition of these elements might further our understanding of subjective violence. © The Author(s), 2009.",Habitus; Humiliation; Masculinity; Memory; Violence,,,,,,,,,"Adorno, T., Horkheimer, M., (1992) Dialectic of Enlightenment, , London: Verso; Anderson, E., (2001) Code of the Street, , New York: Norton; Baudrillard, J., (1993) Symbolic Exchange and Death, , London: SAGE; Baudrillard, J., (2007) The Intelligence of Evil, , Oxford: Berg; Bauman, Z., (2000) Liquid Modernity, , Cambridge: Polity; Bauman, Z., (2001) The Individualized Society, , Cambridge: Polity; Beck, U., Beck-Gernsheim, E., (2001) Individualization, , London: SAGE; Benjamin, W., (1999) Illuminations, , London: Pimlico; Benjamin, W., (1999) The Arcades Project, , Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press; Bourdieu, P., (1986) Distinction, , London: Routledge; Bourdieu, P., (1992) The Logic of Practice, , Cambridge: Polity; Damasio, A., (2003) Looking for Spinoza: Joy, Sorrow, and the Feeling Brain, , Orlando, FL: Harcourt; Evans, D., (1996) An Introductory Dictionary of Lacanian Psychoanalysis, , London: Routledge; Freud, S., (1975) Beyond the Pleasure Principle, , New York: Norton; Freud, S., (1995) The Freud Reader, , London: Vintage; Frosh, S., Psychosocial Studies and Psychology: Is a Critical Approach Emerging?

However, since the latter part of the 20th century, humiliation has become amplified through the mass media in the name of crime control and entertainment. This article situates mass-mediated humiliation within broader trends in criminal justice and popular culture. While the enactment of humiliation via popular culture works powerfully within prevailing cultural beliefs about crime and criminality, there also exists a subversive possibility that threatens to disrupt the forces that attempt to invoke shame for purposes of profit or social control. The popular American tabloid news magazine, Dateline NBC: To Catch a Predator, is used as an example to highlight the ambiguous cultural place of shame. © The Author(s), 2009.",Humiliation; Internet; Media; Predators; Vigilantism,,,,,,,,,"Altheide, D., Gonzo Justice (1992) Symbolic Interaction, 15 (1), pp. 69-86; Babcock, K., Tomicic, A., (2006) Child Sexual Abuse, , Ottawa: National Clearinghouse on Family Violence, Public Health Canada; Baktin, M., (1968) Rabelais and His World, , Cambridge, MA: MIT Press; Bauman, Z., (2006) Liquid Fear, , Cambridge: Polity Press; Best, J., Rhetoric in Claims-making: Constructing the Missing Children Problem (1987) Social Problems, 34 (2), pp. 101-121; Blakely, E., Snyder, M., (1997) Fortress America: Gated Communities in the United States, , Washington, DC: Brookings Institution Press; Braithwaite, J., (1989) Crime, Shame and Reintegration, , New York: Cambridge University Press; Brown, F., Caught up in the Chase (2007) The Quill, 95 (1), p. 25; (2001) Megan's Law: Facts about Sex Offenders, , California Department of Justice Sacramento, CA: Office of the Attorney General of California; Cavender, G., In ""The Shadow of Shadows"": Television Reality Crime Programming (1998) Entertaining Crime: Television Reality Programs, pp. 79-94. , Gray Cavender and Mark Fishman (eds) New York: Aldine De Gruyter; Cavender, G., Media and Crime Policy: A Reconsideration of David Garland's the Culture of Control (2004) Punishment & Society, 6 (3), pp. 335-348; Cavender, G., In Search of Community on Reality TV (2004) Understanding Reality Television, pp. 154-172. , Su Holmes and Deborah Jermyn (eds) New York: Routledge; Cavender, G., Bond-Maupin, L., Fear and Loathing on Reality Television: An Analysis of America's Most Wanted and Unsolved Mysteries (1993) Sociological Inquiry, 63, pp. 305-317; (1998) Entertaining Crime: Television Reality Programs, , Cavender, Gray and Mark Fishman (eds) New York: Aldine De Gruyter; Cohen, A., What's on TV Tonight?

On the one hand, post-subcultural theorists argue the concept of 'subculture' is redundant and obsolete and should be replaced by less bounded or rigid concepts, such as 'neo-tribe', which supposedly better capture the essence of identity formation and lifestyle choices in postmodern consumer culture. On the other hand, critics argue postmodern subcultural theory is an apology for consumerism and posit the continuing relevance of social class as an analytical category. In the last decade or so, and unbeknownst to those working in youth culture studies, cultural criminologists have attempted to adapt 'traditional' subcultural theory to new experiences of 'transgression' which now emerge in the transition to late modernity. Cultural criminology nevertheless has poststructural tendencies. By examining the 'chav' phenomenon in Britain as well as research in youth transitions under 'consumer capitalism', this article argues that 'old' theories and concepts, such as subculture, ought not be so readily disregarded and discarded, and that the notion of 'style' remains applicable to some young people who are marginalized and disadvantaged. The article thus proposes a 'critical cultural criminology' of youth. © The Author(s), 2009.",Chav; Cultural criminology; Neo-tribe; Subculture; Youth culture,,,,,,,,,"Bennett, A., Subcultures or Neo-tribes?

As such, it has tended to downplay the broader social, historical and cultural context of such acts. This article addresses this lacuna by arguing that serial killers are distinctively modern. It highlights six modern phenomena related to serial killing: (a) the mass media and the attendant rise of a celebrity culture; (b) a society of strangers; (c) a type of mean/ends rationality that is largely divorced from value considerations; (d) cultural frameworks of denigration which tend to implicitly single out some groups for greater predation; (e) particular opportunity structures for victimization; and finally (f) the notion that society can be engineered. Combined, these factors help to pattern serial killing in modernity's own self-image, with modernity setting the parameters of what it means to be a serial killer, and establishing the preconditions for serial murder to emerge in its distinctive contemporary guise. © The Author(s), 2009.",Anonymity; Celebrity; Modernity; Narcissism; Rationality; Serial killing,,,,,,,,,"Agamben, G., (1995) Homo Sacer: Sovereign Power and Bare Life, , Stanford, CA: Stanford University Press; A Serial Killer's Perspective (1998) Contemporary Perspectives on Serial Murder, pp. 123-131. , Anonymous R.M.

This article presents a comparative analysis of the perspectives and narrative devices employed by two Portuguese newspapers in establishing a dialogue with their respective audiences. High-profile mediatized criminal cases have the potential to linger in the public memory and become cultural references which may affect long-term public representations of crime and justice. Our analysis is limited to a sample of representative Portuguese newspapers. We found a basic distinction between 'quality' and 'popular' press which may be related to inherent differences of their market and implicit audiences. A distanced, neutral and reflexive style of the quality press contrasts with the construction of a sensationalistic narrative by the popular press. The latter provided the audience with a daily dose of vicarious participation in a criminal drama which developed into a trial by media, sustained by a rhetoric that encourages the audience to 'take sides'. Sensationalist media narratives can potentially undermine the principles of fair trial and the presumption of innocence. But they can also elicit relevant collective energies directed at starting processes of change. © The Author(s), 2009.",Madeleine McCann; Public drama; Trial by media,,,,,,,,,"Almeida, J.F., Costa, A.F., Machado, F.L., Recomposição Socioprofissional e Novos Protagonismos (1994) Portugal: 20 Anos de Democracia, pp. 307-330. , A.

Like street artists and neighborhood assemblies working in a variety of genres, stencil-makers compose public evidence of powerful trans-boundary imaginaries that are at the same time part of a uniquely Argentinean cultural formation. This analysis is based on over 300 digital photographic examples collected by the author in 2007 post-crisis Argentina, where the flourishing of artistic dissent is shaped by vibrant immigrant traditions, widespread poverty, and the recent political history of military dictatorship followed by an economic collapse that radicalized youth and the middle class. Building on Gell's argument that art objects, and the places that form part of their causal milieu, share social agency with the artists that produce them, this article shows how stencils confront institutional power by expanding the semiotic range of two aquatic spaces: a neighborhood fountain in Buenos Aires and a national riverfront monument in Rosario. The focus is on developing an approach towards understanding the active role of public waterscapes in the cultural and political performance of collective memory and social change. © 2009 SAGE Publications.",Art crime; Cultural criminology; Port cities; Semiotic disobedience; Urban water ecology,,,,,,,,,"Arenas, I., Walls and images: Reworking spatial practices, aesthetic form, and Annual Meetings of the Society of Cultural Anthropology, , paper presented, Long Beach, May; Brydon, A., Greenhill, P., Representations of crime: On showing paintings by a serial killer (2003) Crime's Power: Anthropologists and the Ethnography of Crime, pp. 145-172. , P.C.

This development is the 'natural' result of the three wars on the globalized 'other': the war on drugs, the war on terrorism, and the war on the immigrant (see Brotherton and Kretsedemas, 2008). Based on five years of ethnographic study (2002ĝ€""7) with Dominican deportees in both the Dominican Republic and the United States we set out to answer two questions: how do Dominican deportees fare when they return to their 'homeland' after living most of their lives in the United States? And how are deportees reacted to by different levels of Dominican society after being labeled by the public media as criminals and as anti-social elements? In our analysis of the data we found that the crisis of subjectivity of the deportee hinged around two prominent themes: the twin notions of place and displacement and the experience of stigmatization. We concluded that almost regardless of how long the deportee had lived in the United States the stain of a criminal past on his or her identity was permanent. Furthermore, the majority felt that despite their 'freedom' they were still 'doing time' in a world to which flock thousands helped by these same deportees to get the most out of their (tourist) time (Kempadoo, 1999). © 2009 SAGE Publications.",Deportation; Dominican Republic; Immigration; Moral panic; Social displacement,,,,,,,,,"Alexander, J.C., Toward a theory of cultural trauma (2004) Cultural Trauma and Collective Identity, pp. 1-30. , Jeffrey C.

Qualitative content analysis reveals that moral panic is commonly used in news reports in the USA, UK, Australia, and other countries, but it is more likely to be compatible with print (e.g. newspaper) formats than television reports. It is also widely used in literary and art reviews, editorials and op-ed pieces, often by social scientists. Use of the concept has increased over the last decade, particularly in news reports as part of an 'opposing' voice or the 'other side' of articles about deviant behavior, sexual behavior, and drug use. It is suggested that moral panic as 'opposition' fits the entertainment news format, and while this sustains its use by writers and familiarity to audience members, it also appears to be associated with certain topics (e.g. sex and drugs), but not others, such as terrorism in the mainstream media.

She was found guilty of involuntary manslaughter and sentenced to four years' imprisonment. She claimed to have accidentally killed Lilian by pulling on her scarf in a moment of 'exasperation'. Edith was a married woman and mother of five children, whereas Lilian had never married. This article examines how the case was represented in the Daily and Sunday Mirror. In particular, it analyses these newspapers' persistent calls for Edith's release from prison. She was portrayed as an overworked, overburdened mother, who understandably snapped and killed her 'lazy' sister-in-law. She was constructed as a respectable working-class woman who was undeserving of punishment. However, this construction relied upon portraying Lilian through negative stereotypes of the 'spinster', as a 'failed' woman of low social value. With reference to Innes's (2004a, 2004b) concept of the 'signal crime', it is argued that Edith's case can be 'read' by criminologists for mid 20th-century perceptions of gender, class, victimhood and the appropriateness of punishment. © 2009 SAGE Publications.",1950s; Gender; Murder; Respectability,,,,,,,,,"Allen, H., (1987) Justice Unbalanced: Women, Psychiatry and Judicial Decisions, , Milton Keynes: Open University Press; Allen, H., Rendering them harmless: The professional representation of women charged (1987) Criminology at the Crossroads: Feminist Readings in Crime and Criminology, pp. 54-68. , K.

From a largely cultural and thoroughly critical perspective it is logical to develop a comparative analytical design that focuses on outlaw motorcycle clubs and police motorcycle fraternal organizations. Outlaw motorcycle clubs arose following the Second World War, and across the past 50 years have been targeted by law enforcement for their increasingly sophisticated involvement in violent criminal activity. They are characterized by hierarchical command structures, initiation rites and socialization processes, oaths of loyalty, codes of silence, a uniform mode of dress, and outwardly symbolic accoutrements of rank and achievement. Police organizations and cultures are not much different in these aspects of signification; comparative analysis based on naturalistic inquiry may hold the key to greater understanding of both subcultures. © 2008 SAGE Publications.",Motorcycle clubs; Outlaw bikers; Police; Police deviance; Police subculture,,,,,,,,,"Anderson, E., (1999) Code of the Street: Decency, Violence, and the Moral Life of the Inner City, , New York: W.

Yet, if capitalism represents a kind of ubiquitous horizon, one that succeeds in conforming the unrestricted desires of the individual to the burdens of 'reality', as Marcuse suggests in Eros and Civilization (1966), then the political can easily constitute the interior as well. The unified self becomes the projection of an interior polity composed of conflicting interests struggling for control. In this article I explore the phenomena of self-destructive sexualities through a reengagement with Marcuse's performance principle. First, I argue that Marcuse's concept of performance requires an elaboration that prohibits discrete boundaries for when an individual is performing and when they are purely governed by the quest for pleasure. I suggest that only in the briefest instances is pleasure free from the strictures of ideological performance. Consequential to the expansion of Marcuse's performance principle, I examine the dialectic reversal of Eros and Thanatos that suggests self-destructive sexuality as a struggle against endogenous political repression. Finally, I suggest that a self-destructive sexuality is a political act where the body of the individual intersects coextensively with the site of the performance principle. © 2008 SAGE Publications.",Armin Meiwes; Bernd Jurgen Brandes; Dialectic; Freud; Marcuse,,,,,,,,,"Althusser, L., Ideology and ideological state apparatus (2001) Lenin and Philosophy and Other Essays, pp. 85-126. , B.

As such, connections are drawn to the resurgence of nationalistic and neocolonial discourses within the contexts of globalization and the 'war on terror'. Working at the intersections of gender, race, border control and national identity, the Corby phenomenon is taken as a political drama of visuality and nationality that equates bodily security with regional integrity. Thus this article necessarily tracks the persistence of the body of the white female as a unit of currency in the aggressive adherence to historical tropes of nationalism. The mediation of Schapelle's 'criminal' body is shown to deploy a corporeal lexicon of terror through which the celebrity prisoner articulates tensions and changes in bilateral relations with Indonesia. © 2008 SAGE Publications.",Australia; Indonesia; Media; Nationalism; Terror,,,,,,,,,"(2006) Indonesia Refuses Joint Illegal Fishing Patrols, , http://www.abc.net.au/news/newsitems/200606/s1675183.htm, accessed 15 July 2006; (2007) The International Transfer of Prisoners, , http://www.ag.gov.au/www/agd/agd.nsf/Page/ International_transfer_of_prisoners, Australian Government Attorney General's Department (accessed 10 April 2007); Balint, R., The last frontier: Australia's maritime territories and the policing of indonesian fishermen (1999) Journal of Australian Studies, 63. , http://www.api-network.com/main/index.php?apply=scholars&webpage= default&flexedit=&flex_password=&menu-label=&menuID= homely&menubox=&scholar=182, accessed 12 April 2007; Bayuni, E.M., Corby's drug trial and australian public opinion (2005) The Jakarta Post, , http://www.thejakartapost.com/yesterdaydetail.asp?fileid=20050530.A03, 30 May (accessed 30 May 2005); Corby, S., Bonella, K., (2006) My Story, , Sydney: Pan Macmillan Australia; Creed, B., The woman suffers...

Domestic coverage of the English case of James Bulger presented it as alarmingly symptomatic of deep-seated moral decline in Britain that only tough, remoralizing strategies could address. Coverage of the Norwegian case of Silje Redergård constructed it as a tragic one-off, requiring expert intervention to facilitate the speedy reintegration of the boys responsible. Four sets of plausible explanations are offered to account for differences in the ways the two cases were constructed. First, different cultural constructions of childhood endure in each country and these condition the responses deemed appropriate for children who commit grave acts. Second, the dominant claims makers were very different in each jurisdiction with consequences for the quality of the discourses readers encountered. Third, while the legitimacy of elite expertise appears to survive in Norway, it appears to ail in Britain, and addressing this absence of public confidence has become a political priority. Fourth, a consensual political culture obtains in Norway and this makes Norwegian politicians less susceptible to the temptations experienced by adversarially acculturated English politicians to politicize high-profile crimes. © 2008 SAGE Publications.",Childhood; Discourse; Legitimacy; Penal populism; Political culture,,,,,,,,,"Altheide, D.L., (1996) Qualitative Media Analysis, , London: SAGE; Althusser, L., Lenin and philosophy, and other essays (1971) Trans.

Such concern has been driven forward by growing reports of gang activity reported in the media, circulated by populist politicians as well as by academic researchers convinced the European gang has been ignored for too long. This anxiety has coalesced in a perception that the gang is a serious and growing problem, that the rise in lethal violence, as seen recently in inner cities such as London, Birmingham, Manchester and Liverpool, is connected to the proliferation of the gang, and that the solution to the problem of urban gang violence lies in its suppression. This article takes a critical standpoint against these statements and challenges attempts to interpret urban violence in the UK as a problem of gangs or a burgeoning gang culture. It argues that the problem of street-based violence is not always reducible to the gang and suggests that the solution to preventing urban violence will not be found by sanctioning crackdowns or gang suppression programmes. It concludes by offering an alternate perception of the gang and urban violence and signposts areas that research on urban violence might need to address. © 2008 SAGE Publications.",Cultural criminology; Gangs; Rhizomatics; Violence; Youth culture,,,,,,,,,"Battin-Pearson, S., Thornberry, T., Hawkins, D., Krohn, M., Gang membership, delinquent peers and delinquent behaviour (1998) Juvenile Justice Bulletin, , Washington, DC: US Department of Justice; Bean, J.P., (1981) The Sheffield Gang Wars, , Sheffield: D.

Mothers, in comparison to fathers, are perceived as being more influenced by mental disorders and therefore deserving of cure and care rather than punishment. As part of a wider research that compares the construction of fathers and mothers who kill, this article analyzed 19 articles from the three most popular secular Israeli daily newspapers that covered six notorious cases of filicide by mothers between 1992 and 2001. The coverage during the first few days, at the significant initial stages of the process of covering the events, received more in-depth examination. This research shows that the local press tends to stress the psychopathological etiology for the rare Jewish married mother who kills. It also suggests that this attitude is not present in cases of marginalized 'criminal' women: women from ethnic minorities (e.g. Arab women), and mothers who do not fill the traditional role of wife inside the 'well ordered family', as is true of young and unwed girls. © 2008 SAGE Publications.",Cultural construction of social problems; Filicide; Mothers who kill; Press coverage of crimes,,,,,,,,,"Arbeli, A., Suspect of her child's slaughter to be examined by a psychiatrist (2000) Ha'aretz, , 6 March: 20 (in Hebrew); Beno, G., I killed my pretty sweet baby (2001) Ma'ariv, , 9 December: 18 (in Hebrew); Beno, G., Golan, D., Suspected: Mother and live-in friend abused the child to death (2000) Yediot Ahronot, , 5 October: 4 (in Hebrew); Birch, H., (1993) Moving Targets: Women, Murder and Representation, , London: Virago; Cavaglion, G., Israeli press coverage of fathers who kill Child Abuse Review; Cleeton, E., Are you beginning to see a pattern here?

In this article, I seek to challenge this particular construction of cyberspace. I argue that in the broadband era, enhanced bandwidth is increasingly facilitating the exchange of bodily cues and creating stronger convergence with audio-visual media. Second, even in largely text-based online communications, bodily markers often emerge either unintentionally as part of the dynamics of discourse construction or deliberately to authenticate users' identity. Third, the material body is central to Internet use, which is to a considerable extent motivated by bodily needs and desires, as the popularity of countless health and lifestyle websites suggests. Finally, I also argue that constructing the Internet as virtual and disembodied obscures the material and embodied lived reality in which technology operates. © 2008 SAGE Publications.",Body; Communication; Identity; Internet; Technology,,,,,,,,,"Aas, K.F., The Body Does not Lie: Identity, Risk and Trust in Technoculture (2006) Crime Media Culture, 2 (2), pp. 143-158; Aas, K.F., Beyond ""The Desert of The Real"": Crime Control in a Virtual(ised) Reality (2007) Crime Online, , Y.

These quotes are part of a larger pattern of reporting that highlights environmental features of serenity and peacefulness as antidotes to crime. Against claims that crime in the media is always exaggerated, this research demonstrates how the impact of crime is moderated by declaring it unlikely and by discursively shifting it to other geographic locations. It is argued that crime reporting shares a structural similarity with fictional representations of place found in film, and that this pattern of crime reporting helps to reinforce a suburban consumption ethos. © 2008 SAGE Publications.",Crime reporting; Newspapers; Place; Real estate; Suburbs,,,,,,,,,"Altheide, D., Tracking Discourse and Qualitative Document Analysis (2000) Poetics, 27 (5), pp. 289-299; (2002) Gang Rape, Murder Horrify Small New England town, , Associated Press 16 November; (2003) Stunned by Murder-Suicide, Town asks ""Why?, , Associated Press 2 October; Beckett, K., (1997) Making Crime Pay, , New York: Oxford University Press; County Record, B., (2006) Home-Invasion Slaying Going to Trial; Teaneck Couple Charged in Englewood shooting, pp. A1. , 20 March; Shooting Rocks Vermont Town (2005) Berkshire Eagle, , Pittsfield, Massachusetts, 16 March; Blakely, E., Snyder, M.G., Forting Up: Gated Communities in the United States (1998) Journal of Architectural and Planning Research, 15 (1), pp. 61-72; Mother, 2 Children are Slain in N.H.

It also constitutes an important historical document. The photographs were taken over a six-week period in late-2007/early-2008 comprising two separate bodies of work: 1) Documentary images of the now deserted train station buildings dilapidated and war-damaged trains, empty platforms, boarded up ticket windows etc. which convey a strong sense of abandonment and evoke memories of colonialism and the civil war; 2) Reportage about the once-a-month rail service between Phnom Pehn and Battambong. This 300km, 22hr journey is the one time each week when the passenger system cranks into life.

Rather than demonstrating a novel approach to reporting crime, this paper argues that the representation of crime in these texts puts the body politic of the state, and good governance, at risk in ways that resonate with the new modes of subjectivity and responsibility that Nikolas Rose (2007) traces from contemporary biomedicine into populist discourses. © 2008 SAGE Publications.",Biocriminality; Governmentality; Neoliberalism; New Zealand; Newspaper; Risk,,,,,,"University of Otago

The research that I have undertaken attempts to explore how the notion of badness particularly influences the young informant's attitudes, values, behaviour and dress wear. Adapting and integrating the concepts of 'drift' (Matza, 1964), 'code of the street' (Anderson, 1999), and the 'seductions of crime' (Katz, 1988), I examine the way in which the majority of young black males involved with Road Life, look to appropriate and flirt with certain aspects of badness for reasons to do with survival, 'money-making', and aesthetics (style and fashion). I will then go on to briefly focus on the small minority of young males whose lifestyles centre around the practicing of badness; where I am mainly concerned with detailing their values, attitudes and the types of activities that these 'rude boys' might be involved in.

It builds on Peelo's account of the 'mediated witness' as part of the struggle for control of the crime agenda. To extend Peelo's analysis to other areas of public policy making, the paper uses the example of an iconic welfare 'scandal' (the Maria Colwell case) and focuses particularly on the role of victims themselves in the struggle to own and exploit victimhood. The paper argues that ambiguity in the ascription of victimhood can reveal points of unresolved tension in the emerging public narrative that the scandal (or crime) is meant to signify, explain and incorporate. © 2008 SAGE Publications.",Child abuse; Emotionality; Mediated witness; Scandal; Victimhood; Welfare policy,,,,,,,,,"Social Worker not to Blame - Mother (1973) Argus, , 29 November; Mother Fails in Fight for Baby's Custody (1974) Argus, , 19 September; Tomorrow: Maria, the Story still to be Told (1973) Brighton Evening News, , 19 November; Butler, I., Drakeford, M., (2003) Social Policy, Social Welfare and Scandal: How British Public Policy is Made, , London: Palgrave Macmillan; Butler, I., Drakeford, M., (2005) Scandal, Social Policy and Social Welfare, , 2nd Revised edn.

The previous summer, two young girls had been abducted and murdered, and their school caretaker, Ian Huntley was charged with their murder. He was tried alongside his girlfriend, Maxine Carr who, significantly, was not deemed to be an accomplice but was charged with perverting the course of justice, because she provided an alibi for Huntley. Public loathing towards Carr remains intense and when she was released in May 2004 she was granted indefinite anonymity. This article focuses on the visual representation of Maxine Carr, in an attempt to understand the ways in which she was visually constructed in comparison with Ian Huntley. A content analysis and qualitative visual analysis were undertaken on the trial coverage published in The Times (broadsheet), the Daily Mail (middle market) and the Sun (tabloid). The content analysis demonstrated that images of Maxine Carr appeared more frequently than images of Ian Huntley, and were often larger and reproduced in colour. The qualitative visual analysis explored the placement and juxtaposition of the images with each other and with the headline text. We found disturbing evidence of newspaper formatting which could only encourage readers to draw misleading conclusions about Carr's role in the crime. The visual coverage in the press 'told' a very different story than the one which formed the basis for her sentence. We argue that the influence of newspaper page layout and image montages is too frequently overlooked by media scholars, but that it should not be underestimated, particularly in terms of the reporting of high-profile crimes. © 2008 SAGE Publications.",Crime; Newspapers; Soham; Visual analysis,,,,,,,,,"Barthes, R., (1957) Mythologies, , London: Vintage; Barthes, R., (1977) Image/Music/Text, , London: Fontana; Birch, H., If looks could kill: Myra hindley and the iconography of evil (1993) Moving Targets: Women, Murder and Representation, pp. 32-62. , H.

Returning to a text 30 years on in this way combines intellectual, political and personal reflections in an unsettling way. These range from a powerful attachment to processes of collective or collaborative intellectual work that Policing the Crisis (PTC; Hall et al., 1978) embodied and enhanced to a rather depressed sense of how many things the book got right about the trajectory of the British social formation in the mid 1970s (other futures might have been preferable). And above all, there is a sense of what the book stands for in the emergence of cultural studies as an institutionalized academic field. As a way of trying to digest these different responses, I have tried to address three sorts of questions: why PTC mattered, where it belongs and why it continues to have echoes in the present. © 2008 SAGE Publications.",,,,,,,,,,"Alesina, A., Glaeser, E., (2004) Fighting Poverty in the US and Europe: A World of Difference, , Oxford: Oxford University Press; Blunkett, D., (2005) A New England: An English Identity Within Britain, , http://www.ippr.org.uk, the Institute for Public Policy Research, 14 March; Clarke, J., Living With/in and Without Neo-liberalism Focaal; Dench, G., Gavron, K., Young, M., (2006) The New East End: Kinship, Race and Conflict, , London: Profile Books; Elyachar, J., (2005) Markets of Dispossession, , Durham, NC: Duke University Press; Garland, D., (2001) The Culture of Control: Crime and Social Order in Contemporary Society, , Chicago: University of Chicago Press; Gill, L., (2004) The School of the Americas: Military Training and Political Violence in the Americas, , Durham, NC: Duke University Press; Gilroy, P., (2005) Postcolonial Melancholia, , New York: Columbia University Press; Grossberg, L., Does Cultural Studies Have Futures?

Yet, in contrast to the consumer-oriented spaces of the city centre, there has been relatively little attention devoted to the quality of the street spaces in residential neighbourhoods beyond the central city. In this article, we explore how media representations of sex workers as an abject and criminalized Other inform the reactions of residents to street sex work in such communities. Drawing on our work in a number of British cities we highlight the different degrees of tolerance which residents express towards street sex work. In light of the Home Office strategy document, A Coordinated Prostitution Strategy, this article concludes by advocating participatory action research and community conferencing as a means of resolving conflicts and assuaging fears of difference. © 2008 SAGE Publications.",Communities; Fear of crime; Home Office policy; Participatory action research; Sex work,,,,,,,,,"Albrow, M., Travelling beyond local cultures: Socioscapes in a global city (1997) Living in the Global City: Globalization As A Local Process, , J.

The society is battening itself down for 'the long haul' through a crisis. There is light at the end of the tunnel - but not much; and it is far off. Meanwhile, the state has won the right, and indeed inherited the duty, to move swiftly, to stamp fast and hard, to listen in, discreetly survey, saturate and swamp, charge or hold without charge, act on suspicion, hustle and shoulder, to keep society on the straight and narrow. Liberalism, that last back-stop against arbitrary power, is in retreat. It is suspended. The times are exceptional. The crisis is real. We are inside the 'law-and-order' state.

Arguing that some of the concept's subtlety and power has been lost as the term has become popular, the article foregrounds its Freudian and Durkheimian aspects and explicates the epistemological and ethical issues involved in its use. Contrasting the dynamics of moral panics to the dynamics of culture wars, the author shows that both phenomena involve group relations and status competition, though each displays a characteristically different structure. The piece concludes by situating 'moral panics' within a larger typology of concepts utilized in the sociology of social reaction. © 2008 SAGE Publications.",Ethics of attribution; Moral panic; Social reaction; Sociology of moral reaction; Theory,,,,,,,,,"Adler, J.S., The Making of a Moral Panic in 19th-Century America: The Boston Garrotting Hysteria of 1865 (1996) Deviant Behavior, 17, pp. 259-278; Alexander, J., Eyerman, R., Giesen, B., Smelser, N., Sztompka, P., (2004) Cultural Trauma and Collective Identity, , Berkeley, CA: University of California Press; Beck, U., (1992) Risk Society: Toward A New Modernity, , London: SAGE; Best, J., (1999) Random Violence, , Berkeley, CA : University of California Press; Best, J., Horiuchi, G., The Razor Blade in the Apple: The Social Construction of Urban Legends (1985) Social Problems, 32 (5), pp. 488-499; Cohen, S., (1972) Folk Devils and Moral Panics: The Creation of the Mods and Rockers, , Oxford: Martin Robertson; Cohen, S., (1985) Visions of Social Control, , Cambridge: Polity; Cohen, S., (2000) States of Denial: Knowing about Atrocities and Suffering, , Cambridge: Polity; Cohen, S., (2004) Folk Devils and Moral Panics (3rd Edn), , London: Routledge; Cowell, A., Latest Death of Teenager in South London Unsettles Britain (2007) The New York Times; Davis, J., The London garrotting panic of 1861: A moral panic and the creation of a criminal class in mid-victorian England (1980) Crime and the Law: The Social History of Crime in Western Europe since 1500, pp. 190-213. , V.

Researchers from Barcelona, Genova, Milan, Santo Domingo, Quito, and New York City descended on John Jay College of Criminal Justice to discuss the emerging socio-cultural phenomenon of transnational youth gangs developing into street organizations, similar to those documented by the author in the late 1990s in New York City (see Brotherton and Barrios, 2004). The reaction of the media is also comparable, ranging from fear, panic and pathological stereotyping to curiosity and a genuine attempt to paint the subjects in a humanistic and multi-dimensional light. But the response of local political establishments is anything but traditional in the case of two of the cities: Barcelona and Genova. For the city governments in both of these locales have taken the unprecedented step of legally recognizing both the Almighty Latin King and Queen Nation and the Asociacin eta as 'cultural associations' organized by primarily first and 1.5 generation immigrant Latin American youth. The seminar was called to: (a) assemble up-to-date reports and analyses of the local and national growth of these groups based on sustained, collaborative, ethnographic field work; (b) compare the research experience across the multiple field sites; and (c) plan for the next stage of development in what is the only critical ethnographic transnational research of its kind (to our knowledge) currently being undertaken. Before summarizing the proceedings, permit me to briefly provide some background knowledge on the groups under discussion. © 2007 SAGE Publications.",,,,,,,,,,"Brotherton, D.C., Barrios, L., The Almighty Latin King and Queen Nation (2004) Street Politics and the Transformation of A New York Gang, , New York: Columbia University Press; Stanley, C., (1980) Folk Devils and Moral Panics, , Oxford: Martin Robertson; Feixa, C., Porzio, L., Recio, C., (2006) Jovenes Latinos: Espacio Público y Cultura Urbana, , Barcelona: Anthropos; Richard, F., (1992) Making History: The American Left and the American Mind, , New York: Columbia University Press; John, H., (1988) People and Folks, , Chicago: Lake View Press; Hernndez, J.A., Eric Velastegui, la mirada que transmite rdenes (2006) El Pais, , 20 March; Jacobs, J.B., (1977) Statesville: The Penitentiary in Mass Society, , Chicago: University of Chicago Press; Knox, G., An Update on the Latin Kings (1997) The Gang Journal, 1 (5), pp. 63-76; Sherry, O., Resistance and the Problem of Ethnographic Refusal (1995) Comparative Studies in Society and History, 37 (1), pp. 173-193; Yolanda, P., (2007) La Nacin de Las Bandas Orgullo y Perjuicio, , http://www.ladinomo.org; Placer, D., Hem expulsat del grup els delinquents (2006) El Peridico, , 20 March; Sales, F., Las bandas Latinas buscan la paz (2006) El Pais, , 6 March; Smith, N., New Globalism, New Urbanism: Uneven Development in the 21st Century (1999) Working Papers in Local Governance and Democracy, 2, pp. 4-14; Tremlett, G., (2006) Row Erupts in Spain over Treatment of Latin Kings, , http://www.londonguardian.org; Young, J., (1999) The Exclusive Society: Social Exclusion, Crime and Difference in Late Modernity, , London: SAGE Publications","Brotherton, D.; John Jay College of Criminal JusticeUnited States; email: dcbjj@jjay.cuny.edu",,,,,,,,17416590,,,,English,Crime Media Cult.,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-61149727361

Newspaper and magazine articles on a 1992 beachside mugging incident and the Brazilian army's 1994 occupation of several of Rio's poor neighbourhoods are examined as cultural texts through which violence becomes culturally imaginable and new discourses of social difference emerge. The article shows how reports on crime came to constitute a neo-racist discourse centred on images of infection and the creation of social stigmata according to spatial, and not primarily racial, criteria. The key shift in this discourse of crime is from a hegemonic national narrative that celebrated mixing and transgression to one where social and urban boundaries are increasingly impermeable, and transgression is seen as dangerous and threatening. © 2007 SAGE Publications.",Brazil; Crime; Favela; Race; Violence,,,,,,,,,"Aurcio, A., Reconstruindo uma histria esquecida: Origem e expanso inicial das favelas do Rio de Janeiro (1994) Espaecirco e Debates, 14 (37), pp. 34-46; Nderson, B., (1991) Imagined Communities, , London : Verso; Aretxaga, B., Fictional Realities: Paramilitary Death Squads and State Terror Center for Literary and Cultural Studies, , Paper Presented at the, 10 December; Austin, J.L., (1975) How to Do Things with Words, , Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press; Balibar, E., Is there a neo-racism?

With the disappearance of the Gothic prison from the archi-texture of contemporary cities, the meaning conveyed by its faade has lost much of its potency. It is now contemporary prison drama, as opposed to the physical faade, that represents the interface between the public and the prison. This article explores a dramatic representation of the prison (The Shawshank Redemption) through the lens of Freud's (1919/1955) notion of the uncanny and Bachelard's (1958/1994) poetics of domestic space. Incarceration, as depicted in film and television, reinforces the 'place myths' of the prison (Shields, 1991). Contemporary prison drama portrays the prison as a marginal space in much the way that the Gothic faades of the 19th-century prison projected a particular message. The prison, as depicted on screen, is a simulacrum. It is a facsimile of an architectural idea that only ever existed as a faade - a faade that occluded as much as it projected. © 2007 SAGE Publications.",Prison architecture; Prison film; Space; Uncanny,,,,,,,,,"Aug, M., (1995) Non-places: Introduction to An Anthropology of Supermodernity, , London: Verso; Bachelard, G., (1958) The Poetics of Space, , Boston, MA: Beacon Press; Bacou, R., (1975) Piranesi: Etchings and Drawings, , London: Thames and Hudson; Baudrillard, J., (1981) Simulacra and Simulation, , Ann Arbor, MI: University of Michigan Press; Bauman, Z., (1998) Globalization: The Human Consequences, , Cambridge: Polity Press; Carnochan, W.B., The Literature of Confinement (1995) The Oxford History of the Prison, pp. 381-406. , N.

On the contrary, cultural criminology can be seen to incorporate a constellation of critiques designed to expose the distinctly cultural dynamics of late capitalism and its crimes. From this view, cultural criminological analysis overcomes the dichotomization of structure and agency by locating structural arrangements within moments of lived experience, and by exploring in these moments the often confounded possibilities of agency, subversion, and control. In this way cultural criminology calls into question dismissive distinctions between crimes large and small, and continues to investigate the complex process by which crime and transgression are invested with collective meaning. © 2007 SAGE Publications.",Cultural criminology; Late capitalism; Resistance; Romanticization; Trouble,,,,,,,,,"Alvelos, H., The desert of imagination in the city of signs: Cultural implications of sponsored transgression and branded graffiti (2004) Cultural Criminology Unleashed, pp. 181-191. , J.

The research included a natural quasi-experiment, the impact of which was assessed through a large-scale survey and in-depth interviews with members of the public. The key finding from the research was that readership of the column was low (although not as low as survey responses initially indicated), and that the column had no measurable impact on readers. The findings suggest that interest in, take-up, and retention of factual information on crime and criminal justice is not as high as previous empirical research has suggested. © 2007 SAGE Publications.",Media representation of crime; Mixed-method quasi-experimental research; Public opinion,,,,,,,,,"Barak, G., Newsmaking Criminology: Reflections on the Media, Intellectuals, and Crime (1988) Justice Quarterly, 5 (4), pp. 566-587; Blumer, H., Public Opinion and Public Opinion Polling (1948) American Sociological Review, 13 (5), pp. 542-549; Bourdieu, P., (1993) Sociology in Question, , London: SAGE Publications; Champagne, P., Making the People Speak: The Use of Public Opinion Polls in Democracy (2004) Constellations, 11 (1), pp. 61-75; Chapman, B., Mirrlees-Black, C., Brawn, C., (2002) Improving Public Attitudes to the Criminal Justice System: The Impact of Information, , London: Home Office; Ditton, J., Chadee, D., Farrall, S., Gilchrist, E., Bannister, J., From Imitation to Intimidation: A Note on the Curious and Changing Relationship between the Media, Crime and Fear of Crime (2004) British Journal of Criminology, 44 (4), pp. 595-610; Dran, E., Hildreth, A., What the Public Thinks about How We Know What It Is Thinking (1995) International Journal of Public Opinion Research, 7 (2), pp. 128-44; Ericson, R.V., Mass Media, Crime, Law, and Justice (1991) British Journal of Criminology, 31 (3), pp. 219-249; Feilzer, M., The Magic Bullet: Improving Public Knowledge and Confidence Through the Provision of Factual Information on Crime and Criminal Justice (2007) Prison Service Journal, 170, pp. 39-44; Freiberg, A., Affective Versus Effective Justice (2001) Punishment & Society, 3 (2), pp. 265-78; Garland, D., (2001) The Culture of Control, , Oxford : Oxford University Press; Garland, D., Sparks, R., Criminology, Social Theory and the Challenge of Our Times (2000) British Journal of Criminology, 40 (2), pp. 189-204; Hutton, N., Beyond Populist Punitiveness?

The current focus on the allegedly plural and transgressive sub-cultural foreground of criminality has drawn our attention away from the restrictive and constitutive politico-cultural power that the mutating 'deep structure' of capitalism wields over contemporary social life. Rather than delve into the hapless post-political worlds of inter-subjectivity, relativism and micro-exotica in the expectation of finding organic forms of 'resistance', yield ground to cynical actuarialism and retreat from serious critical reasoning, 21st-century criminology must take a step forward in addressing the increasingly competitive, anxious and criminogenic culture of advanced capitalism as it enters a revived and notably brutal phase of primitive accumulation. It can do this by tightening its empirical focus, strengthening its theoretical approach and deepening its philosophical foundations. © 2007 SAGE Publications.",Criminology; Critical theory; Culture; Politics; Resistance,,,,,,,,,"Eagleton, T., (1996) The Illusions of Postmodernism, , Oxford: Blackwell; Jacoby, R., (1999) The End of Utopia: Politics and Culture in the Age of Apathy, , New York: Basic Books; Lyotard, J.-F., (1986) The Postmodern Condition: A Report on Knowledge, , Manchester: Manchester University Press; Williams, R., (1989) The Politics of Modernism: Against the New Conformists, , London: Verso; Zinn, H., (1980) A People's History of the United States of America, , London: Longman; Zizek, S., (2002) Welcome to the Desert of the Real, , London: Verso","Hall, S.; Northumbria UniversityUnited Kingdom; email: steve.hall29@btopenworld.com",,,,,,,,17416590,,,,English,Crime Media Cult.,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-61149522848

She made images of both men and women who were exonerated by post-conviction DNA evidence. All of them were sent to prison, innocent of the crimes of which they were convicted. Most of her subjects had no criminal record. Simon's initial project eventually blossomed into a larger art exhibition that has toured several US cities in the last two years.

Those who saw the attack (in person or through media coverage) emphasized its visual impact. Faced with such visual trauma, it is unsurprising that the aftermath of the attacks had a representational dimension, as individuals and institutions strove to suture the resulting wound through image making. This article investigates the legacy of visual trauma after September 11th in the difficult interim years when disaster is no longer part of the immediate past. I focus on two texts (the Final Report of the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks upon the United States, or 9/11 Report, and a short film by the Mexican director, Alejandro González Iñárritu), each of which displays in different ways the effects of the trauma of witnessing disaster. The aim is to raise questions about the legacy of traumatic events for the legal and cultural responses which follow in their wake, and to that extent the article thinks through the demands of witnessing trauma, the ethical challenges for the cinematic documentation of a traumatic event, and the limits upon judgment in the aftermath of disaster. © 2007 SAGE Publications.",Disaster; Ethics; Image; Judgment; Trauma,,,,,,,,,"Agamben, G., (1995) The Idea of Prose, , Stony Brook, NY: State University of New York Press; Bennett, J., (2005) Empathic Vision: Affect, Trauma, and Contemporary Art, , Stanford, CA: Stanford University Press; Bird, J., The Mote in God's Eye: 9/11, Then and Now (2003) Journal of Visual Culture, 2 (1), pp. 83-97; Caruth, C., (1995) Trauma: Explorations in Memory, , Baltimore, MD: Johns Hopkins University Press; Caruth, C., (1996) Unclaimed Experience: Trauma, Narrative, and History, , Baltimore, MD: Johns Hopkins University Press; Dixon, W.W., Teaching Film after 9/11 (2004) Cinema Journal, 43 (2), pp. 115-118; Edkins, J., (2003) Trauma and the Memory of Politics, , Cambridge: Cambridge University Press; Edkins, J., Ground Zero: Refl ections on Trauma, In/distinction and Response (2004) Journal for Cultural Research, 8 (3), pp. 247-270; Erikson, K., Notes on Trauma and Community (1996) Trauma: Explorations in Memory, pp. 183-199. , C.

Of especial significance in this context are the human capacity and need for creative engagement. The interplay between human ontology, experience, and behavior gives rise to a variety of such expressions and engagements, both normative and illicit in manifestation. Where history, culture, organization, and biography erect limitations, human beings can be expected to seek out or construct alternative, at times playful and at times destructive, experiential spaces for creative engagement. Drawing from cultural criminology, existentialism, and critical humanism, these spaces are provisionally explored. © 2007 SAGE Publications.",Creativity; Cultural criminology; Deviance; Humanism; Ontology,,,,,,,,,"(1923) Metaphysics, , Aristotle Oxford: Oxford University Press; (1988) Nicomachean Ethics, , Aristotle Hackett; Arrigo, B., The Ontology of Crime: On the Construction of the Real, the Image, and the Hyper-Real (2006) Philosophy, Crime, and Criminology, pp. 41-73. , B.

Over the past 15 years, popular culture has been flooded by true-life crime stories, biographies, best-selling fiction, video games and television documentaries devoted to this subject. Cinema is the cultural space in which this phenomenon is perhaps most conspicuous. The Internet Movie Database (imdb.com) lists over 1000 films featuring serial killers and most of the contributions to this sub-genre have been made since 1990. This article examines seminal examples of serial killer fiction and film including Thomas Harris's Hannibal Lecter novels and their cinematic adaptations, Bret Easton Ellis and Mary Harron's American Psycho (1991 and 2000) and David Fincher's Se7en (1995). The main contention is that the commodification of violence in popular culture is structurally integrated with the violence of commodification itself. Starting with the rather obvious ways in which violent crime is marketed as a spectacle to be consumed, this article then attempts to uncover less transparent links between the normal desires which circulate within consumer society and monstrous violence. In 'Monsters Inc.', the serial killer is unmasked as a gothic double of the serial consumer. © 2007 SAGE Publications.",Commodification; Consumerism; Popular culture; Serial killer; Violence,,,,,,,,,"James, A., (1998) Blank Fictions: Consumerism, Culture and the Contemporary American Novel, , London: Pluto; Bartolovich, C., Consumerism, or the cultural logic of late cannibalism (1998) Cannibalism and the Colonial World, pp. 204-237. , Crystal , Barker, Hulme and Iversen (eds) Cambridge: Cambridge University Press; Charles, B., (1998) The Flowers of Evil, , Oxford : Oxford World's Classics; Jean, B., (1996) The System of Objects, , London : Verso; Jean, B., (1998) The Consumer Society: Myths and Structures, , London: SAGE Publications; Walter, B., (1999) Illuminations, , London: Pimlico; Walter, B., (1999) The Arcades Project, , Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press; Herbert, B., (1987) The Eye of the Prey: Subversions of the Postmodern, , Bloomington, IN: Indiana University Press; William, B., The Art of Fiction (1965) Paris Review, 35, pp. 1-37; Conrath, R., Serial heroes: A sociocultural probing into excessive consumption (1996) European Readings of American Popular Culture, pp. 147-58. , John Dean and Jean-Paul Gabilliet (eds) Westport, CT: Greenwood Press; Jacques, D., (1995) Points...: Interviews, 1979-1994, , Stanford, CT: Stanford University Press; Richard, D., (1999) Se7en, , London: BFI; Ellis, E., (1991) American Psycho, , Bret, London : Picador; Frantz, F., (1963) The Wretched of the Earth, , New York: Grove; Sigmund, F., (1981) Introductory Lectures on Psychoanalysis, , Harmondsworth: Penguin; Judith, H., (1995) Skin Shows: Gothic Horror and the Technology of Monsters, , Durham, NC: Duke University Press; Thomas, H., (1990) Silence of the Lambs, , London : Mandarin; Hartson, H.J., Koran, L.M., Impulsive Behaviour in a Consumer Culture' (2002) International Journal of Psychiatry Clinical Practice, 6 (2), pp. 65-68; Haug, W.F., (1986) Critique of Commodity Aesthetics: Appearance, Advertising and Sexuality in Capitalist Society, , Cambridge: Polity; Julian, H., (2000) Collectors.

In this article, we analyze CSI's debut season and also include observations about the program today as well as its two spin-offs: CSI: NY and CSI: Miami. We are interested in the cultural meanings conveyed in this very popular forensic crime drama, especially in terms of the moral authority of the police and of science. We consider how CSI uses the conventions of the crime genre to assert the police as a moral authority. We also demonstrate how CSI portrays a sense of forensic realism, and, in so doing, asserts the veracity of science. We conclude with a discussion of what these meanings suggest about the legitimacy of policing and of science. © 2007 SAGE Publications.",Moral authority; Science; Television crime genre,,,,,,,,,"Altheide, D., (2002) Creating Fear: News and the Construction of Crisis, , New York: Aldine de Gruyter; Armstrong, M., (2000) Premiere Week Ratings: Everybody Loves CBS?, , http://www.eonline.com; Arthur, K., Survivor vs. Idol (2006) New York Times, , 11 March; Cavender, G., Detecting Masculinity (1999) Making Trouble: Cultural Constructions of Crime, Deviance, and Control, pp. 157-175. , J.

When wars end, therefore, the question arises as to the media's past role and the possibilities of reconstructing the media in such a way that it contributes to conflict transformation. This article looks at one specific situation, Northern Ireland, where during the violent political conflict over three decades there was a professional and sophisticated broadcasting environment. Broadcasters have been frequently charged with bias in relation to reporting the conflict, but their record in reporting the peaceful transition has been less well researched. The broadcast by the BBC of three programmes in March 2006 presents a timely case study in the ability of the media to come to terms with peace. Collectively titled Facing the Truth, these three programmes brought together victims and perpetrators with a view to eliciting repentance and forgiveness. Characterizing the approach as 'reality television', the article concludes that the genre cannot adequately deal with many of the major issues involved in conflict transformation. Moreover, the framing of the programmes was such that the producers created an ideal type victim, but in doing so excluded the voices of other victims and survivors. © 2007 SAGE Publications.",Conflict transformation; Media; Northern Ireland; Reality television; Truth,,,,,,,,,"Mark, A., The Kinder, Gentler Gaze of Big Brother: Reality TV in the Era of Digital Capitalism (2002) New Media and Society, 4 (2), pp. 251-270; (2002) Ardoyne: The Untold Truth, , Ardoyne Commemoration Project.

To explore the significance of the discourses emerging from these relationships, this article moves beyond criminology, or at least extends its very elastic boundaries. Although many online behaviours currently causing concern will cease to be popular or will be controlled by advances in new communications technology,1 nonetheless 'we shall be left with a series of new types of criminal behaviour which in some cases will cause us to rethink and augment our existing understandings of crimes and deviant behaviours' (Wall, 1999: 133). The exploration in this article stemmed from a curiosity about cyber-stalking as a new crime but evolved as a theoretical connection that illuminates a contemporary celebritification and commodification of aesthetics, crime and culture. © 2007 SAGE Publications.",Celebritification; Celebrity; Constructionism; Culture; Cyber; Stalking,,,,,,,,,"Ahuja, A., Inside the Mind of a Stalker (2000) The Times, , 28 January; Baudrillard, J., (1983) Simulations, , New York: Semiotext(e); Brown, S., (2003) Crime and Law in Media Culture, , Milton Park: Routledge; Brownmiller, S., (1975) Against Our Will, , Harmondsworth : Penguin; Budd, T., Mattinson, J., Myhill, A., (2000) The Extent & Nature of Stalking: Findings from the 1998 British Crime Survey.

Several points are made about the iconic images of abuse. First, it is argued that these images, along with supporting documents, constitute the photographic record of a crime committed by the capitalist state. This was the high crime of torture. Next the images are used to examine the efficacy of various explanations for the Abu Ghraib scandal. These include the US Government's theory that the abuse was perpetrated by a small group of 'bad apples' within its military police units; Zimbardo's 'automatic brutality' theory of prisoner abuse which suggests that we are all latent torturers; and McCoy's theory that the most sophisticated interrogation practices at Abu Ghraib were designed and executed by the US Central Intelligence Agency, with military police in a supporting role. The weight of evidence supports McCoy's theory, thereby lending credibility to the argument that the torturing of detainees at Abu Ghraib followed directly from decisions made by top government officials, from President George W. Bush on down, to 'take off the gloves' in prisoner interrogations. © 2007 SAGE Publications.",CIA; George W.

This kind of work is performed in an effort to theorize the reflexive role of structure and agency in criminological representation. Each of the three selected cases demonstrates important shifts in conventions of representation that are historically contingent and recursively embedded in developing understandings of the relationship between drugs, individual actors and larger structural forces of sovereignty, inequality, and criminality. Each highlights the nature of a protracted crisis of representation in popular narratives of the war on drugs, where individual actors, even in their most mainstream manifestations, are depicted as caught within complex institutional contradictions which often paradoxically affirm and subvert drug war contexts. © 2007 SAGE Publications.",Discursive gap/closing; Refl exivity; Representation; Structure and agency; War on drugs,,,,,,,,,"Dan, B., (1996) Smoke and Mirrors: The War on Drugs and the Politics of Failure, , New York: Little, Brown and Company; Zygmunt, B., (1998) Globalization: The Human Consequences, , Cambridge: Polity Press; Ulrich, B., (1992) Risk Society: Towards A New Modernity, , London: SAGE Publications; Katherine, B., (1997) Making Crime Pay: Law and Order in Contemporary American Politics, , New York: Oxford University Press; Bellah, R.N., (1986) Habits of the Heart: Individualism and Commitment in American Life, , New York: Harper & Row; Bennett, W.J., Diiulio Jr., J.J., Walters, J.P., (1999) Body Count: Moral Poverty ... and How to Win America's War Against Crime and Drugs, , New York: Simon and Schuster; Pierre, B., (1977) Outline of A Theory of Practice, , Cambridge: Cambridge University Press; Judith, B., (2004) Precarious Life: The Powers of Mourning and Violence, , New York: Verso; Noam, C., (2002) Manufacturing Consent: The Political Economy of Mass Media, , New York: Pantheon; Tom, C., (1990) Clear and Present Danger, , London: HarperCollins; Stanley, C., (1972) Folk Devils and Moral Panics, , London: Macgibbon and Kee; Duke, S.B., Gross, A.C., (1993) America's Longest War: Rethinking Our Tragic Crusade Against Drugs, , New York: Putnam; Troy, D., Pattern, Purpose, and Race in the Drug War: The Crisis of Credibility in Criminal Justice (1997) Crack in America: Demon Drugs and Social Justice, pp. 260-287. , Craig Reinarma and Harry G.

Within this framing of homicide for readers as 'mediated witness', some of the authorial techniques are explored whereby newspapers engage readers in a stylized dialogue that contributes to the construction of public narratives about homicide. It is argued that researchers, as well as working at a macro level, need to research at the micro level of textual analysis when researching media (including visual media) in order to understand the framing that contributes to public narratives; hence there is analysis of techniques of (a) defamiliarization and (b) objectification of homicide victims. These are some of the means by which the reader is placed as witness, both apparently 'experiencing' crime for personal consumption yet, publicly, allowed to recover (unlike real victims of major crime). The recognition of a need for micro-level analysis raises questions about the functions of public narratives, particularly in expressing, exploring and containing public or social emotion, in an era in which public responses to crime have been placed at the top of a highly politicized crime agenda. © 2006 SAGE Publications.",Emotionality; Homicide; Mediated witness; Narratives; Social commentary; Victimhood,,,,,,,,,"Antonowicz, A., (1995) Terror Triads Target Schools, pp. 6-6. , 11 December; Berger, A.A., (1997) Narratives in Popular Culture, Media and Everyday Life, , Thousand Oaks, CA: SAGE Publications; Breithaupt, F., Rituals of Trauma: How the Media Fabricated September 11 (2003) Media Representations of September 11, pp. 67-81. , S.

Based on a review of the literature, we hypothesize that the dominant crimes depicted in comic books are violent street crimes and that the portrayed responses to these crimes are executed outside the rule of law by an avenging protagonist. According to the literature surveyed, comic book protagonists seek to restore public order as a means of returning the community to a constructed, nostalgic ideal. Moreover, the implied policy message in comic books is one of vigilantism, in which moral justice trumps legitimate criminal procedure. Based on a content analysis of 20 contemporary best-selling comic books, themes of organized crime, often involving complex transnational networks, are more prevalent than street crimes, contrary to our hypothesis. However, the response to crime remains focused on vigilante methods and on the restoration of a constructed utopic community that espouses the rule of law. © 2006 SAGE Publications.",Apocalypticism; Comic books; Crime; Cultural criminology; Justice; Retribution,,,,,,,,,"Anderson, B., (1991) Imagined Communities, , London: Verso; Beckett, K., (1997) Making Crime Pay: Law and Order in Contemporary American Politics, , New York: Oxford University Press; Boston Globe (2005) Iraqi Civilian Deaths Mount -and Count, , 17 December; Cavender, G., Media and Crime Policy: A Reconsideration of David Garland's the Culture of Control (2004) Punishment and Society, 6 (3), pp. 335-348; CNN (2001) Bush: Bin Laden ""prime Suspect, , 17 eptember; CNN (2002) Bush Found Voice in Battle Against Terror, , 8 September; CNN (2003) Analysts: War Provides Textbook Case, , 21 April; Cochran, B., DC Sniper Case: Lessons Learned (2006) Communicator, , http://www.rtnda.org/about/pres-Dec02.shtml, December; Creekmur, C., Superheroes and Science Fiction: Who Watches Comic Books?

This article argues that media representation of prisons plays a role in shaping public perceptions as most people have no direct access to prisons. It is argued that the function of prisons is contested in these representations; while some provide support for punitiveness, others present a case for reform. Using the analysis of Ericson et al. (1991), it is argued that these representations are concerned with aspects of social order: social hierarchy, morality, and procedural form. The article argues that Bloomstein's films have provided a voice to marginalized people and opened an alternative dialogue about the purpose of imprisonment, thus presenting challenges to established social hierarchy and morality. However, his films have generally presented hope in rehabilitation, thus reinforcing the procedural form. In Kids Behind Bars, the way Bloomstein has structured the film represents that the imprisonment of children has a detrimental impact, thus challenging the institution of child imprisonment. As such, this is Bloomstein's most radical prison film. The article concludes with an interview with Rex Bloomstein, where he discusses this film. © 2006 SAGE Publications.",Children; Documentary; Juveniles; Media; Prison,,,,,,,,,"Audit Commission (2004) Youth Justice 2004: A Review of the Reformed Youth Justice System, , London: Audit Commission; Barnouw, E., (1993) Documentary: A History of the Non-fiction Film, , Oxford: Oxford University Press; Bennett, J., Undermining the Simplicities: The Films of Rex Bloomstein (2005) Captured by the Media, pp. 122-136. , P.

The combination of over-reporting of violent and sexual crime in the media and fictional constructions of imprisonment has been a highly significant factor in the growth of the prison population in late modernity. Providing a discourse analysis of one month's UK media output on prison, it argues that through a discourse of dangerousness delivered to a fearful public, prison is constructed unproblematically as a solution to crime, echoing the 'what works' mantra of New Labour. The meaning of prison, it argues, is shifted from a place of pain delivery to one which treats and trains. The article further contends that media discourse of the prisoner precludes any rational debate about alternatives to prison. Media representations of incarceration as an institution full of murderers, rapists and paedophiles precludes a long overdue debate about prison suicides, the erosion of prisoners' rights and the rising number of women and children incarcerated. © 2006 SAGE Publications.",Abolition; Criminal justice; Journalism; Media; Prison,,,,,,,,,"Carabine, J., Unmarried Motherhood 1830-1990: A Genealogical Analysis (2001) Discourse As Data: A Guide for Analysis, pp. 267-307. , M.

However, relatively little attention has been paid specifically to the nature of the symbolic frameworks through which substance misuse is represented and even less attention to the part played by the news media in the reproduction of these symbolic frameworks. This article takes volatile substance abuse (VSA) and ecstasy as examples through which to explore the ways in which news production processes, together with the symbolic and inferential frameworks employed by journalists, intersect with structures of disadvantage, to reproduce particular news discourses or ways of understanding substance misuse. It suggests that VSA receives very little attention in the United Kingdom national press in comparison to 'spectacular', or 'glamorous' drugs such as ecstasy, despite the evidence available that VSA represents a problem of, at least, equivalent magnitude, if recorded associated annual deaths are taken as the measures of 'seriousness'. It is suggested that significantly different symbolic frameworks are deployed in national newspapers to represent the 'problems' associated with VSA and ecstasy, and that these differences are explicable in terms of the cultural assumptions and inferential frameworks underpinning news production, together with news source activity, and the marketing strategies of newspapers in an era of intensified news commodification. © 2006 SAGE Publications.",Drugs and media;

However, they can involve deviance. Employing multiple media sources, this study identifies symbolic themes expressed through daily work rituals at Enron's corporate headquarters. The themes involve risk, gratification, pride, and fantasy imagery. Utilizing structural ritualization theory, this article suggests that ritualized symbolic practices expressing these themes extensively influenced Enron employees. They shaped their cognitions, patterns of behavior, and social interaction. They also led to the normalization and reproduction of deviance. The findings of this study contribute to research on organizational deviance and structural ritualization. © 2006 SAGE Publications.",Corporate culture; Organizational deviance; Structural ritualization theory; White-collar crime,,,,,,,,,"Akers, R.L., (1998) Social Structure and Social Learning, , Los Angeles: Roxbury; Barrionuevo, A., Your Career Matters: Jobless in a Flash, Enron's Ex-employees Are Stunned, Bitter, Ashamed (2001) Wall Street Journal, , 11 December; Barrionuevo, A., Enron Secretary Defends Her Criticism of Executives (2006) Wall Street Journal, , 23 February; Braithwaite, J., White-collar Crime (1985) Annual Review of Sociology, 11, pp. 1-25; Strategy, B., Europe's Enron and a January Corporate Crisis (2004) Brand Strategy, pp. 12-13; Robert, B., (2002) Pipe Dreams: Greed, Ego, and the Death of Enron, , New York: Public Affairs; Marshal, C., Quinney, R., (1973) Criminal Behavior Systems: A Typology, , New York: Holt, Rinehart and Winston; Coleman, J.W., (1985) The Criminal Elite, , New York: St. Martin's Press; Coleman, J.W., Toward an Integrated Theory of White-collar Crime (1987) American Journal of Sociology, 93, pp. 406-439; Donald, C., The Criminal Violation of Financial Trust (1950) American Sociological Review, 15, pp. 738-743; Donald, C., (1953) Other People's Money: A Study in the Social Psychology of Embezzlement, , Glencoe, IL: Free Press; Donald, C., The Poverty of Theory in Corporate Crime Research (1989) Advances in Criminological Theory, 1, pp. 31-55. , W.S.

This article charts the UK government's attempts to engage in this process and illustrates how the communication of the terrorist risk meshes into broader cultural formations of crime and (in)security. Our analytical framework utilizes the risk society as the scene in which governmental strategies are parcelled up and unpacked. It is posited that the framing of the terrorist problem through the political discourse of 'new terrorism' has built upon and escalated a cultural climate of fear and uncertainty. At the level of political communication, it will be elucidated that media representations of the terrorist threat have served to further embed discourses of responsibilization. In our view such processes not only articulate a reduced notion of safety, they also pave the way for the simplistic construction of a non-white 'terroristic other' that has negative consequences for ethnic minority groups in the UK. © 2006 SAGE Publications.",New terrorism; Politics of fear; Responsibilization; Risk,,,,,,,,,"Allan, S., (2002) Media, Risk and Science, , Maidenhead: Open University Press; Banks, M.O., Spaces of (In)security: Media and Fear of Crime in Local Context (2005) Crime, Media, Culture, 1 (2), pp. 169-187; Barbaret, R., Country Survey: Spain (2005) European Journal of Criminology, 2 (3), pp. 341-367; Barnaby, F., (2003) How to Build A Nuclear Bomb and Other Weapons of Mass Destruction, , London: Granta; Bauman, Z., (2005) Liquid Life, , Cambridge: Polity; Beck, U., (1992) Risk Society: Towards A New Modernity, , London: SAGE Publications; Beck, U., The Cosmopolitan State: Towards a Realistic Utopia (2001) Eurozine, , http://www.eurozine.com/articles/2001-12-05-beck-en.html; Beck, U., The Terrorist Threat: World Risk Society Revisited (2002) Theory, Culture & Society, 19 (4), pp. 39-55; Beck, U., The Silence of Words and the Political Dynamics in the World (2002) Logos, 1 (4), pp. 1-18; Biglino, I., (2002) Anti-terrorism Legislation in Britain, , London: Liberty; Burkitt, I., Powerful Emotions: Power, Government and Opposition in the ""war on Terror (2005) Sociology, 39 (4), pp. 679-695; Bush, G., (2006) State of the Union Address, , Washington: White House; Caplan, P., (2000) Risk Revisited, , London: Pluto; Chadee, D., Ditton, J., Fear of Crime and the Media: Assessing the Lack of Relationship (2005) Crime, Media, Culture, 1 (3), pp. 322-332; Chevigny, P., The Populism of Fear: Politics of Crime in the Americas (2003) Punishment & Society, 5 (1), pp. 77-96; Chu, B., Terror Threat: The Great Deception (2006) Independent, , 15 February; Clarke, J., New Labour's Citizens: Activated, Empowered, Responsibilized, Abandoned?

Both of these trends are related to gender stereotypes about femininity and masculinity, and the increased power and visibility of women in contemporary society. Also interrogated in both these discussions is the complicity of some academics with the 'masculinization' of certain girls and women, thereby lending a certain legitimacy to their punishment, incarceration, and execution. The latter factor has resulted in significant backlash against women, as witnessed by the explosion in arrest rates and incarceration of girls and women in spite of decreases in violent crime. Women, particularly marginalized women, continue to be harshly judged for any departure from traditional feminine ideals. © 2006 SAGE Publications.",Female violence; Girls' aggression; Lesbians; Masculinity; Masculinization,,,,,,,,,"Primetime Live, A.B.C., (1997) Girls in the Hood, , 5 November; Adler, F., The Rise of the Female Crook (1975) Psychology Today, 9, pp. 42-46; Adler, F., (1975) Sisters in Crime, , New York: McGraw Hill; (2001) Justice by Gender: The Lack of Appropriate Prevention, Diversion and Treatment Alternatives for Girls in the Justice System, , http://www.abanet.org/crimjust/juvjus/justicebygenderweb.pdf; Anderson, D., Caged women (1996) Girlfriends, pp. 24-27. , Nov/Dec; Artz, S., (1998) Sex, Power, and the Violent Schoolgirl, , Toronto: Tirfolium Books; Baskin, D.R., Sommers, I.B., (1998) Casualties of Community Disorder: Women's Careers in Violent Crime, , Boulder, CO: Westview; Bjorkqvist, K., Niemela, P., New Trends in the Study of Female Aggression (1992) Of Mice and Women: Aspects of Female Aggression, pp. 1-16. , K.

This article addresses this question by examining the 2002 televised 'retrial' of Louis Riel, a man executed by the Canadian government in 1885. The retrial's producers encouraged viewers to vote (through a website) on the merits of Riel's conviction 'according to the laws of Canada today'. As an aesthetic form that diverted and informed the audience, the programme was a test of 'post-documentary's' ethical dimensions. In this case it was not hybridity of form and intent that undermined the programme's potential to effect corrective justice; rather the deliberate insertion of false information about the death penalty's application misrepresented the criminal justice past and present. © 2006 SAGE Publications.",Aesthetics; Capital punishment; Ethics; Re-enactment; Reality television,,,,,,,,,"Agnew, V., Introduction: What is Re-enactment (2004) Criticism, 46 (3), pp. 327-339; Andrejevic, M., (2004) Reality TV: The Work of Being Watched, , Lanham, MD: Rowman and Littlefield; Atwood, M., (1972) Survival: A Thematic Guide to Canadian Literature, , Toronto: Anansi; Barnsley, P., Should Canada Pardon Riel, or Should the Métis Pardon Canada?

The increasing demand for technological verification of identity is a result of intricate connections between our notions of the self, order, efficiency and security. Behind the growing acceptance of these new technologies, such as biometric passports, biometric ID cards, drug testing, and DNA databases, are fears connected to those who may have a 'stolen identity', are unidentified, or 'identity-less', such as potentially fraudulent welfare recipients, 'identity thieves', terrorists, immigrants and asylum seekers. However, unlike Foucault's disciplinary power, the latest technologies no longer see the body as something that needs to be trained and disciplined, but rather as a source of unprecedented accuracy and precision. Bodies become 'coded' and function as 'passwords'. This form of identification is particularly relevant since its mode of operation enables identification and denial of access at-a-distance, thus fitting perfectly into the contemporary modes of disembedded global governance. © 2006 SAGE Publications.",Biometrics; Body; Foucault; Risk; Social exclusion,,,,,,,,,"Aas, K.F., (2005) Sentencing in the Age of Information: From Faust to Macintosh, , London: The GlassHouse Press; Aftenposten (2003) Tjenestemennene Støtter Huuse, , 25 June; Aftenposten (2006) Viser Fingeren: Fr Adgang, , 30 January; Giorgio, A., Bodies Without Words: Against the Biopolitical Tatoo (2004) German Law Journal, 5 (2), pp. 168-169; Jon, B., (1991) Personvern i Faresonen, , Oslo: Cappelen; Stanley, C., Post-moral Torture: From Guantanamo to Abu Ghraib (2005) Index on Censorship, 34 (1), pp. 24-30; Cole, S.A., (2001) Suspect Identities, , Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press; (2005) NSW Police Eye Roadside Fingerprint Biometrics, , http://www.computerworld.com.au/, 14 October; Curry, M., The Profiler's Questions and the Treacherous Traveler: Narratives of Belonging in Commercial Aviation (2004) Surveillance & Society, 1 (4), pp. 475-499; Nå kommer ""superpasset"" (2003) Dagsavisen, , 7 July; Mary, D., The Two Bodies (1970) The Body: A Reader, pp. 73-77. , M.

We contend that there are numerous homologies between the meaning content, objects and tenor of these two terms, and suggest that the 'chav' represents a popular reconfiguration of the underclass idea. However, we are also keen to note the way in which the concept of social marginality is reconfigured in this substitution. Specifically, we argue that the discourse of the underclass turned crucially upon a (perceived or real) pathology in the working classes' relations to production and socially productive labour. Its emergent successor, the concept of the 'chav', is in contrast oriented to purportedly pathological class dispositions in relation to the sphere of consumption. In a bid to highlight this shift we consider the emergence of debates upon social marginality and consumption practices, and attempt to locate popular media discourse surrounding the 'chav' within this frame, including the various ways in which purportedly pathological consumption practices serve to organise this form of social classification. © 2006 SAGE Publications.",Chav(s); Consumer culture; Media stereotypes; Social exclusion; Underclass,,,,,,,,,"Anderson, L., Wadkins, M., The New Breed in Japan: Consumer Culture (1992) Canadian Journal of Administrative Studies, 9, pp. 146-153; Baudrillard, J., (1970) La Société de Consommation, , Paris: Gallimard; Baudrillard, J., (1981) For A Critique of the Political Economy of the Sign, , St Louis, MO: Telos Press; Bauman, Z., (1987) Legislators and Interpreters: On Modernity, Post-modernity and Intellectuals, , Cambridge: Polity; Bauman, Z., (1992) Intimations of Postmodernity, , London: Routledge; Bauman, Z., (1998) Work, Consumerism and the New Poor, , Buckingham: Open University Press; Berger, P.L., Neuhaus, R.J., (1977) To Empower People: The Role of Mediating Structures in Public Policy, , Washington, DC: American Enterprise Institute for Public Policy Research; Bok, L., (2004) The Little Book of Chavs, , Cheam: Crombie Jardine; Bourdieu, P., (1984) Distinction: A Social Critique of the Judgement of Taste, , London: Routledge and Kegan Paul; Bourgois, P., (2003) In Search of Respect, , Cambridge: Cambridge University Press; Buckingham, A., Statistical Update (1996) Charles Murray and the Underclass: The Developing Debate, pp. 166-190. , R.

This work is linked to two long-term projects. One is the 'discourse of fear', the pervasive communication, symbolic awareness, and expectation that danger and risk are a central feature of everyday life. The other is 'the language of justice', or a discourse analysis of justice speech and the construction of social control. Our aim in this project is to explore the changing discourse of incarceration. News reports were selected and analyzed using ethnographic content analysis and 'tracking discourse', or following certain issues, words, themes, and frames over a period of time, across different issues, and across different news media. We find that 'smart on crime' did promote more lenient sentences for less demonized offenders, but the message was more receptive to news organizations if delivered by claims makers associated with criminal justice organizations. Some implications for claims making and the social construction of reality are discussed. © 2006 SAGE Publications.",Criminal justice system; Discourse analysis; Incarceration; Media analysis and language,,,,,,,,,"ABC News (1994) Nightline, , 26 January; ABC News (2004) Nightline: Three Strikes -Crime and Punishment.

As these forms are replaced by individualism, fragmentation and differentiation in a fluid, unstable culture governed by advanced capitalism's economic command to consume and discard with increasing rapidity, everyday values and practices are undergoing radical reconfiguration. Here we offer field data from two distinct social groups that are caught up in this process of change: socially incorporated young people in low paid service work, and socially excluded criminal young men from the north east of England. If this set of data is analysed in critical rather than celebratory ways, it suggests that current economic and cultural forces, rather than liberating individuals from repressive structures and traditions, are promoting sufficient atomization, instrumentalism and insecurity in specific locales to threaten social cohesion and further increase the flow of young people into criminality. © 2005 SAGE Publications.",Consumerism; Criminality; Individualization; Insecurity; Instrumentalism,,,,,,,,,"Baudrillard, J., (1986) America, , London: Verso; Bauman, Z., (2001) The Individualized Society, , Cambridge: Polity Press; Bauman, Z., (2003) Liquid Love, , Cambridge: Polity Press; Beck, U., (1992) Risk Society, , London: SAGE Publications; Beck, U., Beck-Gernsheim, E., (2002) Individualization, , London: SAGE Publications; Bourdieu, P., (1984) Distinction: A Social Critique of the Judgement of Taste, , London: Routledge and Kegan Paul; Bourdieu, P., Wacquant, L., New Liberal Speak: Notes on the New Planetary vulgate (2000) Radical Philosophy, p. 105; Byrne, D., (1989) Beyond the Inner City, , Buckingham: Open University Press; Castells, M., The Information Age: Economy, Society and Culture (1996) The Rise of the Network Society, 1. , Oxford: Blackwell; Chatterton, P., Hollands, R., Theorising Urban Playscapes: Producing, Regulating and Consumering Youthful Nightlife City Spaces (2002) Urban Studies, 39 (1), pp. 95-116; Chesney-Lind, M., Pasko, L., (2004) The Female Offender: Girls, Women and Crime, , London: SAGE Publications; Davis, M., (1998) Ecology of Fear, , London: Picador; Debord, G., (1995) The Society of the Spectacle, , New York: Zone; Downes, D., Rock, P., (2003) Understanding Deviance, , Oxford: Oxford University Press; Faludi, S., (1999) Stiffed: The Betrayal of the Modern Man, , London: Chatto and Windus; Fletcher, J., (1997) Violence and Civilization, , Cambridge: Polity Press; Freud, S., (1930) Civilization and its Discontents, , London: Hogarth; Freud, S., Beyond the Pleasure Principle (1920) The Pelican Freud Library, 11. , London: Pelican; Gray, J., (1998) False Dawn: The Delusions of Global Capitalism, , London: Granta Books; Habermas, J., The New Obscurity: The Crisis of the Welfare State and the Exhaustion of Utopian Energies (1989) The New Conservatism, , J.

Drawing on a range of primary and secondary sources, I extend Clive Emsley's (1992) seminal work on 'the indulgent tradition' of the English police by analysing how, in the immediate post-war period, a convergence of circumstances enabled The Blue Lamp to break with previous popular cultural representations. The article offers a series of insights into the deep cultural and interpretive work that had to be undertaken by Ealing Studios to produce PC George Dixon, the iconic image of the English 'bobby on the beat'. It also suggests that despite this 'Ealingization' of the English 'bobby', for box office reasons audiences were also offered the metropolitan spectacle, glamour and turmoil of the chaotic life of the violent young 'cop killer' played by Dirk Bogarde. © 2005 SAGE Publications.",'bobby on the beat;'; Cultural constructions; Ealingization; Englishness; Spectacle of criminality; Spiv; Welfare policing,,,,,,,,,"Aldgate, A., (1992) Cinema and Society: Britain in the 1950s and 1960s, , Milton Keynes: Open University Press; Aldgate, A., Richards, J., The Thin Blue Line: The Blue Lamp (1999) Best of British: Cinema and Society from 1930 to Present, pp. 125-147. , A.

While it referred to a wide and imprecise range of behaviours, it appears to have resonated with the desires and concerns of media audiences. In this article we consider the reasons why 'road rage' has proved to be such a popular media object and examine the essential question of whether there has been a real increase in a type of crime that could be labelled 'road rage'. A content analysis is used to measure the degree to which criminal and noncriminal events are captured in 'road rage' stories in the media. These results are juxtaposed against the incidence of 'road rage' events reported to the police and survey findings on the perceived likelihood of being involved in a 'road rage' incident. The sudden appearance and rapid diffusion of road rage as an object of media attention is interpreted using the natural history approach to social problems. The results add to a growing body of findings which can be used to illuminate the trajectory of media interests in regard to 'new' crimes. © 2005 SAGE Publications.",Media; Natural history; Road rage,,,,,,,,,"Averill, J.R., (1982) Anger and Aggression: An Essay on Emotion, , New York: Springer Verlag; Averill, J.R., Studies on Anger and Aggression (1983) American Psychologist, 38, pp. 1145-1160; Barak, G., (1994) Media, Process and the Social Construction of Crime, , New York: Garland; Becker, H., (1966) Social Problems, , New York: Wiley; Best, J., (1990) Threatened Children: Rhetoric and Concern about Child-Victims, , Chicago: University of Chicago Press; Best, J., (1999) Random Violence: How We Talk about New Crimes and New Victims, , Berkeley: University of California Press; Best, J., Furedi, F., The Evolution of Road Rage in Britain and the United States (2001) How Claims Spread, pp. 107-127. , J.

It argues that a politics of paedophilia has emerged in which inter-agency consensus on the issue of 'what to do' with high-profile sex offenders has broken down. Accordingly, the article situates newspaper 'outing' of paedophiles in the community in relation to vigilante journalism and leaked information from official agencies. The article then presents research findings from a case study of news events set in train following a whistle-blowing reaction by Prison Officers' Association officials to Home Office plans. Drawing from a corpus of 10 interviews with journalists and key protagonists in the story, the article discusses both the dynamics of whistle blowing about paedophiles and also what happens after the whistle has blown. © 2005 SAGE Publications.",Inter-agency conflict; Local press; News leaks; Paedophiles in the community; Vigilante journalism,,,,,,,,,"Adams, J., Beware This Evil Pervert (1997) Evening Argus, p. 1. , 14 October, p; Aldridge, M., The Ties that Divide: Regional Press Campaigns, Community and Populism (2003) Media, Culture and Society, 25, pp. 491-509; Named and Shamed (2000) News of the World, p. 1. , Anonymous editorial , 23 July, p; Bell, V., The Vigilant(e) Parent and the Paedophile: The News of the World Campaign 2000 and the Contemporary Governmentality of Child Sexual Abuse (2002) Feminist Theory, 3 (1), pp. 83-102; Bellos, A., Police Warn of Threat to Young Males: Town on Paedophile Alert (1997) Guardian, p. 2. , 15 October, p; Byrne, C., Sun's Anti-yob Campaign Raises ""Lynch Mob"" Fears (2003) Guardian, p. 18. , 20 October, p; Collier, R., Dangerousness, Popular Knowledge and the Criminal Law: A Case Study of the Paedophile as Sociocultural Phenomenon (2001) Personal Autonomy, the Private Sphere and the Criminal Law, pp. 223-243. , P.

The SUV boom has attracted widespread coverage in the mainstream media but little scholarly attention. The following article examines the historical and social context of the SUV through analysis of popular press accounts, automotive reviews and trade news, and SUV print advertisements. Situating the SUV in the context of fear of crime and risk management during the 1980s and 1990s, it is suggested that the SUV's popularity reflects American attitudes toward crime, random violence, and the importance of defended personal space. While consumer attraction to the SUV is typically attributed to two key features - safety and interior space - these pragmatic justifications may be viewed as euphemistic. Safety is not road safety but personal safety. Space is not interior cargo space but social space, including the privileged ability to traverse inhospitable terrain to remove oneself from society. © 2005 SAGE Publications.",Automobile; Fear of crime; Risk; Security; Space; Sport utility vehicle,,,,,,,,,"Andersen, R., Road to Ruin: The Cultural Mythology of SUVs (2000) Critical Studies in Media Commercialism, pp. 158-172. , R.

The first of these is the home. The integration of media technologies into the moral economy of the household, and textual readings made within the context of a contested 'politics of the sitting room' (Morley, 1992), provide a framework for the interpretation of media crime. Second, and of most interest here, senses of community attachment associated with living in a particular locality are judged to shape the meaning and interpretation of media crime. The article draws on interviews with two households in a suburb of Manchester and argues that the impact of media crime must be considered within a framework that takes place seriously, both as a context for everyday action and as a force in shaping community identity and personal and shared senses of fear and (in)security. The article highlights the historical neglect of spatial context in studies of audience reception of media crime and argues for the need to develop more 'place sensitive' research into the impact of media discourses on audiences' fear of crime. © 2005 SAGE Publications.",Class; Community; Fear of crime; Manchester; Media,,,,,,,,,"Ang, I., (1996) Living Room Wars: Rethinking Media Audiences for a Postmodern World, , London: Routledge; Banks, M., (1998) Televising the Region: The Production and Consumption of Cranadaland, , Unpublished PhD thesis.

Much of what has been 'transferred' has been terminology or rhetoric rather than the technologies and techniques of crime control. That is not to imply that these transfers have been inconsequential, for' political rhetoric and official representations of crime and criminals have a symbolic significance and a practical efficacy that have real social consequences. Sometimes ""talk"" is ""action""' (Garland, 2001: 22). In this article we outline a particular case of lesson-drawing that has had, we argue, a dramatic impact on British penal policy. This case, the defeat of Michael Dukakis in the 1988 US Presidential election, has had a long- lasting impact on electoral politics in the USA but also, we suggest, in the more specific arena of the mediated politics of crime control in the UK. © 2005 SAGE Publications.",Comparative penal policy; Lesson-drawing; Politics; Symbolic politics,,,,,,,,,"Anderson, D.C., (1995) Crime and the Politics of Hysteria: How the Willie Horton Story Changed American Justice, , New York: Random House; Anderson, P., Mann, N., (1997) Safety First: The Making of New Labour, , London: Granta; Ansolabehere, S., Iyengar, S., (1995) Going Negative: How Political Advertisements Shrink and Polarize the Electorate, , New York: Free Press; Baer, K., (2000) Reinventing Democrats: The Politics of Liberalism from Reagan to Clinton, , Lawrence, KS: University Press of Kansas; Beckett, K., (1997) Making Crime Pay: Law and Order in Contemporary American Politics, , New York: Oxford University Press; Bennett, C., What is Policy Convergence and What Causes It?

It highlights the limitations of Western research testimonies as being largely silent on the interplay between cultural antecedents and prison scholarship. This is particularly problematic for conducting research into Russian prisons, which evolved along a distinctive cultural trajectory: the prisoner as the loyal hero and the prison as pillar of Soviet nationalism and identity. I argue that cultural knowledge of Russian society is essential to assess how prisons have changed. The article reports on the ethnographic approach adopted whereby the experience was one of shared subjectivity (mastering Russian and immersion in cultural rituals). The exciting ethnography of living in prisons did enrich the 'deep level' understanding of penal transformation. However, my own position in this study resulted in me becoming over-immersed and existentially disoriented. The article concludes by commenting on my own ethnographic conundrum and constructing an explanation that reflects the local cultural sensibility. © 2005 SAGE Publications.",Culture; Ethnography; Hazards; Poetry; Prison; Russia,,,,,,,,,"Bacon, E., Glasnost and the Gulag: New Information on Soviet Forced Labour Around World War Two (1992) Soviet Studies, 44 (6), pp. 1069-1086; Bacon, E., (1994) The Gulag at War: Stalin's Forced Labour System in Light of the Archives, , London: Macmillan; Berger, L., Inside Out: Narrative Autoethnogrpahy as a Path Toward Rapport (2001) Qualitative Inquiry, 7 (4), pp. 504-518; Carlen, P., (1998) Sledgehammer: Women's Imprisonment at the Millennium, , London: Routledge; Dostoevsky, F.M., (1860) The House of The Dead, , Harmondsworth: Penguin; Dostoevsky, F.M., (1865) Crime and Punishment, , Harmondsworth: Penguin; Elias, N., (1984) The Civilising Process, , Oxford: Blackwell; Foucault, M., (1979) Discipline and Punish, , London: Peregrine Books; (1998) Ethnography at the Edge: Crime, Deviance and Field Research, , Ferrell, J. and M.S.

Four key changes are identified which together, the authors argue, suggest significant change is underway in respect of patterns of alcohol consumption in the UK. Presenting empirical data for the first time, the article considers how one might assess the evidence for a new culture of intoxication which embraces both legal and illicit drugs and which encompasses a broad social spectrum of young people. The study concludes that the pursuit of altered states of intoxication must be positioned in late modern society as behaviour which is a vehicle for consumer and criminal justice discourses, both encouraged by economic deregulation and constrained by legislative change, indicative of the ambiguities at the heart of British alcohol policy. © 2005 SAGE Publications.",Alcohol; Binge drinking; Bounded consumption; Intoxication; UK; Young people,,,,,,,,,"Abrahamson, M., Alcohol in Courtship Contexts: Focus-group Interviews with Young Swedish Women and Men (2004) Contemporary Drug Problems, 31, pp. 3-29; Aitkenhead, D., Village People (2001) Guardian, , 24 October; Bailey, P., (1978) Leisure and Class in Victorian England: Rational Recreation and the Contest for Control, 1830-1885, , London: Routledge and Kegan Paul; Balding, J., (1999) Young People in 1998, , Exeter: Exeter University; Bauman, Z., (1997) Postmodernity and Its Discontents, , Cambridge: Polity; Bell, D., (1975) The Cultural Contradictions of Capitalism, , New York: Basic Books; Blears, H., (2005), www.bbc.co.uk/bbcthree/news, Available at:, 21 January; Brain, K., (2000) Youth, Alcohol and the Emergence of the Post-modern Alcohol Order, , Occasional Paper No.1.

This particular murder, exceptionally, prompted widespread re-examination of questions of (in)justice, cultural identity and continuing racism in British society and it eventually initiated processes of institutional reflexivity including government policies targeting institutionalized racism within Britain's most powerful organizations of state and civil society. The Stephen Lawrence case unfolded within the arenas and processes of the criminal justice system, but the public story of' Stephen Lawrence', the central concern of this article, was principally played out within the nation's media (and some international media too). It was here that the symbolic and moral charge of the case became generalized outwards to different publics in society, galvanizing emotions and appealing to a sense of moral solidarity sub- junctively oriented to how society should or could be. This article, based upon analysis of the extensive media reporting over the ten year period 1993-2003 and developing theoretical ideas of' mediatized public crisis' as a form of' society in action',explores how the mainstream British media' performed' the Stephen Lawrence case and thereby transformed it into a' mediatized public crisis' embroiling as it did so powerful institutions of state (police, judiciary, government) and unleashing institutional reflexivity, social reforms and cultural change. © 2005 SAGE Publications.",' society in action'; Media performance; Mediatized public crisis; Moral solidarity; Publics; Ritual; Social drama,,,,,,,,,"Alexander, J.C., Culture and Political Crisis: ""Watergate"" and Durkheimian Sociology (1988) Durkheimian Sociology.

This has occurred as cities attempt to reimage and remarket themselves in the context of regional, national and international inter-urban competition for capital investment. A re-emphasis on the visual in the politics of the street underpins changes in the primary definition over urban spatiality and statecraft. This article examines these powerful definitional processes as a strategy to create visually pleasing space that is impacting on discourses and practices of surveillance that target forms of 'crime' and 'incivility' and contribute to the spatial production process itself. It is argued that in producing urban spaces of an entrepreneurial kind, contemporary surveillance practices need to be placed within wider debates about continuing urban inequality and the meaning of spatial justice. © 2005 SAGE Publications.",Crime; Entrepreneurial city; Primary definition; Social control; Space; Surveillance,,,,,,,,,"Bannister, J., Fyfe, N.R., Kearns, A., Closed Circuit Television and the City (1998) Surveillance, Closed Circuit Television and Social Control, pp. 21-39. , C.

We use a specific film - Chicago (Miramax Films, 2002) - to investigate the cultural embeddedness of the emotional and sensual parameters that are said to constitute the foreground of criminal activity. We suggest that the stated aim of cultural criminology - to connect the phenomenal foreground of criminal acts to their material background - is laudable but that there is also a pressing need to connect that foreground to specific features of its cultural background. Our analysis of the film Chicago exposes the social circulation of important cultural motifs that help to make sense of why certain kinds of emotional and sensual features might be attended to in accounts of the commission of crimes. © 2005 SAGE Publications.",Chicago; Cinema; Crime; Culture; Seductions,,,,,,,,,"Best, S., Kellner, D., (1991) Postmodern Theory: Critical Interrogations, , New York: Guilford Press; Boorstin, D., (1961) The Image: A Guide to Pseudo-Events in America, , New York: Atheneum; Braudby, L., (1986) The Frenzy of Renown: Fame and its History, , New York: Oxford University Press; Cavender, G., Detecting Masculinity (1999) Making Trouble: Cultural Constructions of Crime, pp. 157-178. , J.
