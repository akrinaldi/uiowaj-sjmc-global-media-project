Yet, it is not entirely clear just why this link exists, as some studies have suggested that smartphones can act as a serious distraction for romantic partners, whereas other studies have found that it is dependency on these devices that is most strongly linked to relationship issues. The current study seeks to replicate earlier findings showing that smartphone dependency is the key variable implicated in relational health. Moreover, this study tests whether there are important individual-level variables (loneliness and selfesteem) that can possibly explain the relationship between smartphone dependency and relational issues. Working with a population of undergraduate college students currently in romantic relationships, the study finds that smartphone dependency, and not self-reported use, predicts lower relationship satisfaction and less relationship certainty. In addition, the study finds that loneliness partially mediates the relationship between dependency and both relationship satisfaction and certainty. © 2020.","Loneliness; Personal relationships; Smartphone dependency; Smartphone use; Smartphones",,,,,,,,,"Ahlstrom, M., Lundberg, N.R., Zabriskie, R., Eggett, D., Lindsay, G.B., Me, my spouse, and my avatar: The relationship between marital satisfaction and playing massively multiplayer online role-playing games (MMORPGs) (2012) Journal of Leisure Research, 44, pp. 1-22; (2007) Apple reinvents the phone with iPhone, , http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2007/01/09Apple-Reinvents-the-Phone-with-iPhone.html; Armstrong, L., Phillips, J.G., Saling, L.L., Potential determinants of heavier internet usage (2000) International Journal of HumanComputer Studies, 53, pp. 537-550; Baumeister, R.F., Identity, self-concept and self-esteem: The self lost and found (1997) Handbook of personality and psychology, pp. 681-710. , In R.

However, it has often been criticized that the video games are poorly matched (i.e., relative to neutral video games, they may differ not only in their violent and prosocial content but also on a variety of dimensions), so it is unclear what video game property exactly accounts for the video game's impact. This criticism can be addressed when different in-game roles, varying in terms of aggression/prosocial behavior, among a single game are investigated. The present research focused on the class-based first-person shooter ""Overwatch. ""Using a large sample of actual gamers (N 2,323), we assessed the relation between players' in-game role preference and a range of personality traits. Preference for aggressive (relative to prosocial) roles was linked to a more aggressive and less prosocial type of personality. Self-perceived aggressive in-game behavior also correlated positively with aggressive traits and negatively with empathic traits. However, this was only observed using self-report measure and not in a smaller sample with objective playtime measures. Overall, it appears that one's favored role in a video game relates to certain personality traits. Future perspectives on video games, in-game role, personality, and social behavior are discussed. © 2018 American Psychological Association.","Aggression; Empathy; In-game role; Personality; Video game",,,,,,,,,"(2016) Activision Blizzard announces better-than-expected and record third quarter 2016 financial results, , http://investor.activision.com/results.cfm, Retrieved from; Adachi, P.J.C., Willoughby, T., The effect of video game competition and violence on aggressive behavior: Which characteristic has the greatest influence (2011) Psychology of Violence, 1, pp. 259-274. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/a0024908; Anderson, C.A., Bushman, B.J., Human aggression (2002) Annual Review of Psychology, 53, pp. 27-51. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1146/annurev.psych.53.100901.135231; Anderson, C.A., Dill, K.E., Video games and aggressive thoughts, feelings, and behavior in the laboratory and in life (2000) Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 78, pp. 772-790. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/0022-3514.78.4.772; Anderson, C.A., Sakamoto, A., Gentile, D.A., Ihori, N., Shibuya, A., Yukawa, S., Kobayashi, K., Longitudinal effects of violent video games on aggression in Japan and the United States (2008) Pediatrics, 122. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1542/peds.2008-1425; Anderson, C.A., Shibuya, A., Ihori, N., Swing, E.L., Bushman, B.J., Sakamoto, A., Saleem, M., Violent video game effects on aggression, empathy, and prosocial behavior in eastern and western countries: A meta-analytic review (2010) Psychological Bulletin, 136, pp. 151-173. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/a0018251; Arnold, H.J., Feldman, D.C., Social desirability response bias in self-report choice situations (1981) Academy of Management Journal, 24, pp. 377-385; Bean, A.M., Ferro, L.S., Vissoci, J.R.N., Rivero, T., Groth-Marnat, G., The emerging adolescent World of Warcraft video gamer: A five factor exploratory profile model (2016) Entertainment Computing, 17, pp. 45-54. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.entcom.2016.08.006; Bettencourt, B.A., Talley, A., Benjamin, A.J., Valentine, J., Personality and aggressive behavior under provoking and neutral conditions: A meta-analytic review (2006) Psychological Bulletin, 132, pp. 751-777. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/0033-2909.132.5.751; Buckels, E.E., Jones, D.N., Paulhus, D.L., Behavioral confirmation of everyday sadism (2013) Psychological Science, 24, pp. 2201-2209. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0956797613490749; Buckels, E.E., Paulhus, D.L., (2014) Comprehensive Assessment of Sadistic Tendencies (CAST), , Unpublished instrument, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada; Bushman, B.J., Anderson, C.A., Violent video games and hostile expectations: A test of the general aggression model (2002) Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, 28, pp. 1679-1686. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/014616702237649; Buss, A.H., Perry, M., The aggression questionnaire (1992) Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 63, pp. 452-459. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/0022-3514.63.3.452; Chabrol, H., van Leeuwen, N., Rodgers, R., Séjourné, N., Contributions of psychopathic, narcissistic, Machiavellian, and sadistic personality traits to juvenile delinquency (2009) Personality and Individual Differences, 47, pp. 734-739. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.paid.2009.06.020; Davis, M.H., Measuring individual differences in empathy: Evidence for a multidimensional approach (1983) Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 44, pp. 113-126. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/0022-3514.44.1.113; Ewell, P.J., Guadagno, R.E., Jones, M., Dunn, R.A., Good person or bad character?

This study extended this line of self-determination theory (SDT) through the examination of specific mechanisms that link social Question and Answering site usage to the satisfaction of the intrinsic needs for competence, autonomy, and relatedness. Results revealed that although writing activities were associated with all three need satisfactions, reading activities were associated with the satisfaction of autonomy and competency, and sharing/archiving activities were only associated with the need for competency. Furthermore, only the autonomy need was found to be related to enjoyment. Results were discussed in terms of the theoretical contributions to online media entertainment research. Practical implications for the industry were addressed. © 2018 American Psychological Association.","Enjoyment; Entertainment; Self-determination; Social Q&A",,,,,,,,,"Bergkvist, L., Rossiter, J.R., The predictive validity of multipleitem versus single-item measures of the same constructs (2007) Journal of Marketing Research, 44, pp. 175-184. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1509/jmkr.44.2.175; Byrne, B.M., (1998) Structural equation modeling with LISREL, PRELIS and SIMPLIS: Basic concepts, applications and programming, , Mahwah, NJ: Erlbaum; de Vries, R.E., van den Hooff, B., de Ridder, J.A., Explaining knowledge sharing: The role of team communication styles, job satisfaction, and performance beliefs (2006) Communication Research, 33, pp. 115-135. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0093650205285366; Hu, L.T., Bentler, P.M., Cutoff criteria for fit indexes in covariance structure analysis: Conventional criteria versus new alternatives (1999) Structural Equation Modeling, 6, pp. 1-55. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10705519909540118; Ji, Q., Cui, D., The enjoyment of social Q&A websites usage: A multiple mediators model (2016) Bulletin of Science, Technology and Society, 36, pp. 98-106. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0270467616658744; Ji, Q., Raney, A., Examining suspension of disbelief, perceived realism, and involvement in the enjoyment of documentary-style fictional films (2016) Projections: The Journal for Movies and Mind, 10, pp. 125-142. , http://dx.doi.org/10.3167/proj.2016.100207; Kim, J., Seo, M., Yu, H., Neuendorf, K., Cultural differences in preference for entertainment messages that induce mixed responses of joy and sorrow (2014) Human Communication Research, 40, pp. 530-552. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/hcre.12037; La Guardia, J.G., Ryan, R.M., Couchman, C.E., Deci, E.L., Within-person variation in security of attachment: A self-determination theory perspective on attachment, need fulfillment, and well-being (2000) Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 79, pp. 367-384. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/0022-3514.79.3.367; Lee, J.G., Antoniadis, P., Salamatian, K., (2010) Faving reciprocity in content sharing communities a comparative analysis of Flickr and Twitter, , http://hal.upmc.fr/hal-00527137/,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ASONAM.2010.51, In Proceedings from International Conference on Advances in Social Networks Analysis and Mining (ASONAM); McDonald, R.P., Ho, M.-H.R., Principles and practice in reporting structural equation analyses (2002) Psychological Methods, 7, pp. 64-82. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/1082-989X.7.1.64; Morris, M., Teevan, J., Panovich, K., (2010) What do people ask their social networks, and why?, , A survey study of status message Q&A behavior.

Across 2 studies, the multidimensional Fan Identity Scale was developed and validated. The resulting 9-item survey yielded 3 factors that encompassed both personal and social dimensions of fan identity. In Study 2, the relationship between these dimensions and 3 facets of well-being was also explored. Results indicated that overall fan identity predicted overall well-being.

Scholars tend to either treat discrete features of identification as equivalent to the broader construct or use a rigid, monothetic measurement architecture that potentially excludes some who may actually identify with a game avatar. Toward a more inclusive model, then, this study integrated different factors culled from the literature to develop a more comprehensive measurement scheme in which physical similarity, value homophily, wishful identification, perspective-taking, liking, and embodiment are all subconstructs that fall under the larger umbrella of the player-avatar identification construct. The second-order factor structure suggests the construct to be more complex than is currently engaged in the literature, and a polythetic approach to measuring identification is proposed for understanding gamers' connections with their avatars. © 2018 American Psychological Association.","Avatars; Identification; Measures; Polythetic construct; Video games",,,,,,,,,"Andersen, P.A., Todd de Mancillas, W.R., Scales for the measurement of homophily with public figures (1978) The Southern Speech Communication Journal, 43, pp. 169-179. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10417947809372379; Bailey, K.D., Constructing monothetic and polythetic typologies by the heuristic method (1973) The Sociological Quarterly, 14, pp. 291-308. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1533-8525.1973.tb00862.x; Bandura, A., (1986) Social foundations of thought and action: A social cognitive theory, , Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice Hall; Bandura, A., Social cognitive theory of mass communication (2002) Media effects: Advances in theory and research, pp. 121-153. , J.

Binge-watching has now become the new normative way to consume TV shows. Nevertheless, along with its recent massive rise has come concerns about the associated mental and physical health outcomes. Currently available results suggest the potential harmfulness and even addictive nature of bingewatching. The psychological investigation of this behavior, however, is still in its infancy, with most studies using a confirmatory approach and assuming a priori its genuine addictive nature. In contrast, the current perspective article argues the case for an exploratory approach as an initial step for conducting research on behaviors that-at first sight-look like addiction when applying a symptom-based approach. A qualitative understanding of the phenomenological characteristics of binge-watching as the foundation of an initial comprehensive discussion makes it possible to formulate hypotheses concerning its potentially addictive nature and to emphasize challenges and directions for future research. Here we propose an exploration of the dynamics of binge-watching behavior based on a model involving emotion regulation in the etiology and maintenance of problem binge-watching. © 2018 American Psychological Association.","Behavioral addictions; Binge-watching; Emotion regulation; Impulsivity; TV series",,,,,,"Fonds De La Recherche Scientifique - FNRS, FNRS","Pierre Maurage (Research Associate) is funded by the Belgian National Foundation for Scientific Research (F.R.S.-FNRS, Belgium).",,"Adalian, J., Fernandez, M.E., (2016) The business of too much TV, , http://www.vulture.com/2016/05/peak-tv-businessc-v-r.html, (May 18); Alter, A., (2017) Irresistible: The rise of addictive technology and the business of keeping us hooked, , New York, NY: Penguin Press; (2017) Sleep or Netflix?.

This content analysis aims to address a gap in the literature, as a first step toward understanding the cultivation effects of race and ethnicity portrayals on reality TV programs. Competitive reality TV programs were chosen due to the perception that anyone can try-out or be chosen for most of these shows, leading to a larger pool of possible participants. Data from casts in shows airing from 2000 to 2013 were collected. Racial, ethnic, age, disability status, and elimination order data were collected from 653 contestants. These data were compared with U.S. Census data to answer key research questions. Analyses suggest no significant difference in the proportion of contestants who are female in comparison with the American population. Some racial and ethnic groups are overrepresented, and others significantly underrepresented, but minority status (gender, race, ethnicity, or age) does not affect performance in competitions, meaning marginalized groups do not fare any differently than majority group members. Additional research is necessary to understand representation in portrayal and narratives in reality programming. © 2018 American Psychological Association.","Content analysis; Marginalized groups; Minority; Reality TV; Representation",,,,,,,,,"Allport, G.W., (1954) The nature of prejudice, , Cambridge, MA: Addison Wesley Publishing; Arnett, J.J., Adolescents' uses of media for self-socialization (1995) Journal of Youth and Adolescence, 24, pp. 519-533. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF01537054; Aronoff, C., Old age in prime time (1974) Journal of Communication, 24, pp. 86-87. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1460-2466.1974.tb00412.x; Bagley, G., A mixed bag: Negotiating claims in MTV's the Real World (2001) Journal of Film and Video, 53, pp. 61-77. , www.jstor.org/stable/20688357; Bandura, A., (1986) Social foundations of thought and action: A social cognitive theory, , Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice-Hall, Inc; Bandura, A., Social cognitive theory of mass communication (2002) Media effects: Advances in theory and research, pp. 43-67. , J.

This study examined whether portrayals of emotions varied across U.S. storybooks whose characters represented ethnic and racial groups in the United States. Popular storybooks were grouped by the race and ethnicity of the main characters as African American, Asian American, European American, or Hispanic and Latino. Each depiction of a main character was coded for the type and intensity of emotion displayed and the activity and social context of the display. Results revealed that storybook groups differed in which positive and negative emotions were shown. Variations were consistent with cultural values. For instance, consistent with the script simpatíca in Hispanic and Latino culture, storybooks depicting Hispanic and Latino characters showed happiness proportionally more than other storybooks and in the context of more arousing activities, whereas consistent with individualistic goals like autonomy, storybooks depicting African American and European American characters showed dislike proportionally more than other storybooks. Storybooks also differed in the social context of emotion portrayals. More characters were present during emotion displays in storybooks that depicted Asian American and Hispanic and Latino characters than in storybooks that depicted European American characters. Combined, these findings suggest that there is variation in the emotion messages provided in popular U.S. storybooks. © 2018 American Psychological Association.","Early childhood; Emotion; Ethnicity; Race; Storybooks",,,,,,,,,"Aram, D., Biron, S., Joint storybook reading and joint writing interventions among low SES preschoolers: Differential contributions to early literacy (2004) Early Childhood Research Quarterly, 19, pp. 588-610. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecresq.2004.10.003; Atkinson, A.P., Dittrich, W.H., Gemmell, A.J., Young, A.W., Emotion perception from dynamic and static body expressions in pointlight and full-light displays (2004) Perception, 33, pp. 717-746. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1068/p5096; Blankson, A.N., Weaver, J.M., Leerkes, E.M., O'Brien, M., Calkins, S.D., Marcovitch, S., Cognitive and emotional processes as predictors of a successful transition into school (2017) Early Education and Development, 28, pp. 1-20. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10409289.2016.1183434; Brown, G.L., Craig, A.B., Halberstadt, A.G., Parent gender differences in emotion socialization behaviors vary by ethnicity and child gender (2015) Parenting: Science and Practice, 15, pp. 135-157. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15295192.2015.1053312; Brownell, C.A., Svetlova, M., Anderson, R., Nichols, S.R., Drummond, J., Socialization of early prosocial behavior: Parents' talk about emotions is associated with sharing and helping in toddlers (2013) Infancy, 18, pp. 91-119. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1532-7078.2012.00125.x; Campos, B., Shiota, M.N., Keltner, D., Gonzaga, G.C., Goetz, J.L., What is shared, what is different?

The present study investigated emotional experiences induced by death metal music with extremely violent themes and examined whether enjoyment of this genre of music is associated with personality traits. Fans (N = 48) and nonfans (N = 97) listened to 60-s excerpts of death metal music and rated their emotional experiences. Compared with nonfans, fans experienced a wide range of positive emotions including power, joy, peace, and wonder. In contrast, nonfans reported uniformly negative experiences, including tension, anger, and fear. Fans and nonfans were also distinguished by personality traits, with fans lower in conscientiousness and agreeableness, and in their motivations for listening to music. Results suggest that individuals with certain personality traits and music-listening motivations are drawn toward aggressive music with violent themes, and their enthusiasm for this genre promotes a range of positive emotional responses to this music. © 2018 American Psychological Association.","Aggressive behavior; Emotions; Music; Preferences; Violent media",,,,,,"Australian Research Council, ARC: DP160101470","This research was supported by an Australian Research Council Discovery Project grant (DP160101470) awarded to William Forde Thompson.

The results from a survey of gamers (N = 220) support the proposed model, demonstrating perceptions of social agency (via explicit and implicit anthropomorphism and electronic propinquity) that are significantly different among the four agents in the matrix.

Recent correlational and longitudinal research findings have seemingly uncovered a new predictor of cyberbullying perpetration: media violence exposure. Our research further tested the correlation between media violence exposure and cyberbullying perpetration but statistically controlled for trait aggression and traditional bullying to determine if the previously found relationship between media violence and cyberbullying is spurious to broader aggression or not. Adult participants (N = 377; average age = 34.87 years) recruited from Mechanical Turk (MTurk) completed measures of cyberbullying and bullying perpetration, trait aggression, and media violence exposure. Replicating past work, correlational analyses showed that media violence correlated with cyberbullying, traditional bullying, and trait aggression; however, the relationship between media violence exposure and cyberbullying perpetration was reduced to nonsignificance when controlling for other forms of aggression.

The present study examined how Facebook activity affects mood in a subset of emerging adults, specifically undergraduates attending a private 4-year university. Participants (N = 312) were randomly assigned to one of the following 20-min activities: browse the Internet, passively browse others' Facebook profiles, actively communicate with others on Facebook via messages/posts, or update their own personal profile on Facebook. Participants also completed questionnaires assessing mood, feelings of envy, and perceived meaningfulness of their time online. The results demonstrated that using Facebook led to significantly worsened mood compared with browsing the Internet, especially when participants passively browsed Facebook. Furthermore, perceptions of meaningfulness, but not feelings of envy, mediated the relationship between online activity and mood. Overall, these findings add to the mounting evidence that social media use may, at times, adversely affect psychological well-being. © 2018 American Psychological Association.","Envy; Facebook; Mood; Social media",,,,,,,,,"Appel, H., Gerlach, A.L., Crusius, J., The interplay between Facebook use, social comparison, envy, and depression (2016) Current Opinion in Psychology, 9, pp. 44-49. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.copsyc.2015.10006; Arnett, J.J., Emerging adulthood.

Because cultural depictions create individuals' musical identity, we expect the musical norms identified by previous content analyses to be reflected by lyrics produced by males and females. The lyrics of all 4,534 songs that have reached the United Kingdom's top five singles sales chart between March 1960 and December 2015 were computer-analyzed to consider the association between 40 aspects of each and both the proportion of females who recorded each song and the gender of the vocalist. There were few associations between the lyrical content and vocalist gender. However, the proportion of all musicians who recorded each song who were female was associated positively with the lyrics containing words indicative of inspiration and variety and negatively with the lyrics containing different words, and words indicative of aggression, passivity, cooperation, diversity, insistence, embellishment, and activity. Songs recorded by a high proportion of female musicians described a wide range of subject matters in the context of abstract virtues, whereas songs recorded by a high proportion of male musicians were more likely to address stereotyped concepts of adolescent masculinity that were positively and negatively valanced. © 2018 American Psychological Association.","Charts; Gender; Lyrics; Music",,,,,,,,,"Allen, J.G., Haccoun, D.M., Sex differences in emotionality: A multidimensional approach (1976) Human Relations, 29, pp. 711-722. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/001872677602900801; Barr, C.L., Kleck, R.E., Self-other perception of the intensity of facial expressions of emotion: Do we know what we show?

However, only country and pop charts have been analyzed thus far. In the current study, we assess the music and lyrics along with the sex and age of the artists who recorded 65 Billboard R&B/Hip-Hop songs of the year between 1946 and 2010. Mirroring both country and pop artists, after the introduction of MTV in 1981, audiences gravitated toward more mature and therefore more comforting artists when the economy is sour and social problems are more prevalent. However, unlike pop stars but like country artists, female R&B/Hip-Hop artists are more likely to place songs atop the Billboard charts in difficult social and economic times. Still, like songs atop the Billboard Pop charts (but unlike country Billboard hits), when social and economic times become difficult, R&B/Hip-Hop songs are less likely to have lyrics about leisure or fun, and they are more likely to be longer, slower, and therefore sadder sounding. We hypothesize trends in the R&B/Hip-Hop charts are closely aligned to the pop charts because ""black music"" is, and always has been, more influential on pop than the more folk-oriented country music. © 2018 American Psychological Association.","Billboard charts; Economy; Hip hop music; Music; R&B music",,,,,,,,,"Balkwill, L.-L., Thompson, W.F., A crosscultural investigation of the perception of emotion in music: Psychophysical and cultural cues (1999) Music Perception, 17, pp. 43-64. , http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/40285811; Barber, N., Secular changes in standards of bodily attractiveness in women: Tests of a reproductive model (1998) International Journal of Eating Disorders, 23, pp. 449-454. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/(SICI)1098-108X(199805)23:4<449::AID-EAT14>3.0.CO;2-R; Barber, N., The slender ideal and eating disorders: An interdisciplinary ""telescope"" model (1998) International Journal of Eating Disorders, 23, pp. 295-307. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/(SICI)1098-108X(199804)23:3<295::AID-EAT7>3.0.CO;2-E; Christenson, P., Roberts, D.F., Bjork, N., Booze, drugs, and pop music: Trends in substance portrayals in the billboard top 100-1968-2008 (2012) Substance Use and Misuse, 47, pp. 121-129. , http://dx.doi.org/10.3109/10826084.2012.637433; Dawson-Andoh, N.A., Gray, J.J., Soto, J.A., Parker, S., Body shape and size depictions of African American women in JET magazine, 1953-2006 (2011) Body Image, 8, pp. 86-89. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bodyim.2010.09.006; DeNora, T., (2000) Music in everyday life, , http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/CBO97805.11489433, Cambridge, United Kingdom: Cambridge University Press; DeWall, N.C., Pond, J.R., Campbell, K.W., Twenge, J.M., Turning in to psychological change: Linguistic markets of psychological traits and emotions over time in popular U.S. song lyrics (2011) Psychology of Aesthetics, Creativity, and the Arts, 5, pp. 200-207. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/a0023195; Dowd, T.J., Blyler, M., Charting race: The success of Black performers in the mainstream recording market, 1940 to 1990 (2002) Poetics, 30, pp. 87-110. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0304-422X(02)00008-6; Dowd, T.J., Liddle, K., Blyler, M., The success of female acts in the U. mainstream recording market, 1940-1990 (2005) Research in the Sociology of Organizations, 23, pp. 81-123. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0733-558X(05)23003-3; Eastman, J.T., Pettijohn, T.F., II, Gone country: An investigation of Billboard Country Songs of the Year across social and economic conditions in the USA (2015) Media Psychology, 4, pp. 155-171; Flynn, M.A., Craig, C.M., Anderson, C.N., Holody, K.J., Objectification in popular music lyrics: An examination of gender and genre differences (2016) Sex Roles, 75, pp. 164-176; Grabe, S., Ward, L.M., Hyde, J.S., The role of the media in body image concerns among women: A meta-analysis of experimental and correlational studies (2008) Psychological Bulletin, 134, pp. 460-476. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/0033-2909.134.3.460; Hall, P.C., West, J.H., Hill, S., Sexualization in lyrics of popular music from 1959 to 2009: Implications for sexuality educators (2012) Sexuality and Culture: An Interdisciplinary Quarterly, 16, pp. 103-117. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12119-011-9103-4; Harrison, A.K., Arthur, C.E., Reading Billboard 1979-89: Exploring rap music's emergence through the music industry's most influential trade publication (2011) Popular Music and Society, 34, pp. 309-327. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03007766.2010.522806; Herd, D., Changes in the prevalence of alcohol use in rap song lyrics, 1979-97 (2005) Addiction, 100, pp. 1258-1269. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.l360-0443.2005.01192.x; Herd, D., Changes in the prevalence of alcohol in rap music lyrics 1979-2009 (2014) Substance Use and Misuse, 49, pp. 333-342. , http://dx.doi.org/10.3109/10826084.2013.840003; Hobbs, D.R., Gallup, G.G., Jr., Songs as a medium for embedded reproductive messages (2011) Evolutionary Psychology, 9, pp. 390-416. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/147470491100900309; Kellaris, J.J., Kent, R.J., The influence of music on consumers' temporal perceptions: Does time fly when you're having fun?

Results showed that participants who indicated playing video games more frequently had a significantly greater increase in moral competence than those who indicated playing fewer or no video games. © 2018 American Psychological Association.","MCT; Moral competence; Moral reasoning; Video games",,,,,,,,,"Adachi, P.J., Hodson, G., Willoughby, T., Zanette, S., Brothers and sisters in arms: Intergroup cooperation in a violent shooter game can reduce intergroup bias (2014) Psychology of Violence, 5, pp. 455-462. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/a0037407; Adachi, P.J., Willoughby, T., The effect of video game competition and violence on aggressive behavior: Which characteristic has the greatest influence?

In Study 1, Football Manager players (N = 349) completed an online questionnaire measuring their social identity, quality of friendships, self-esteem, and psychological well-being. Study 2 utilized the equivalent methodology but in relation to FIFA players (N = 95), in which social identity was framed by their affiliation as online versus offline players. Study 1 found that social identity was positively related to well-being. Study 2 found differential effects of social identity as a result of the context of play. Specifically, positive associations were found for players who played in offline contexts in respect of support and depth of relationships. Overall, positive associations were found between social identity and self-esteem. This research highlights the application of social identity theory through a more nuanced contextual lens, to more fully understand its psychosocial impacts. © 2018 American Psychological Association.","Context; Digital gaming; Friendships; Social identity; Well-being",,,,,,,,,"Abrams, D., Hogg, M.A., Comments on the motivational status of self-esteem in social identity and inter-group discrimination (1988) European Journal of Social Psychology, 18, pp. 317-334. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ejsp.2420180403; Adachi, P.J.C., Willoughby, T., Do video games promote positive youth development?

Given the partial overlap between problematic Internet and smartphone use (PIU and PSU, respectively), the present study seeks to investigate whether the same personality traits can be linked to overuse of both platforms. A total of 612 participants (177 males/435 females, mostly students) completed questionnaires assessing both PIU and PSU, and the NEO Five Factor Inventory (NEO-FFI) to measure the Five-Factor Model of Personality and the Self-Directedness scale of the Temperament and Character Inventory. Our results indicate the existence of a common personality structure linked to both PIU and PSU. Interestingly, the associations between personality and PIU were higher than those concerning PSU. Low Self-Directedness appears to be the best predictor of overuse on both digital platforms. Therefore, lower willpower anchored in the personality trait Self- Directedness may reflect the core of digital additive tendencies. © 2018 American Psychological Association.","Internet addiction; Personality; Self-Directedness; Smartphone addiction",,,,,,"Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG: MO2363/3-2, MO2363/2-1

However, previous research on the topic has been mixed. These issues were investigated in a sample of 3,003 adults in Trinidad. The impact of fictional media, news media, and reality TV as well as perceived crime risk were examined related to perceived fears of crime. Only perceived risk of crime victimization was related to fear of crime. No media variables predicted fear of crime. These results suggest that media exposure is not a primary route through which fear of crime develops. © 2017 American Psychological Association.","Fear of crime; Mass media; Victimization",,,,,,"Race and Difference Initiative, Emory University, RDI","Research was supported by (1) Research Development Impact (RDI) Fund Grant and (2) Association of Commonwealth University (ACU) Fellowship Grant.",,"Allen, M., Emmers-Sommer, T.M., D'Alessio, D., Timmerman, L., Hanzal, A., Korus, J., The connection between the physiological and psychological reactions to sexually explicit materials: A literature summary using meta-analysis (2007) Communication Monographs, 74, pp. 541-560. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03637750701578648; Anderson, N., Contributions to information integration theory (1991), 1. , Cognition.

Following research that suggests that parasocial interactions are multidimensional, we investigated which personality, reading, and viewing motives predicted 4 dimensions of parasocial interaction with characters in the ""Harry Potter"" series. The pattern of significant predictors indicated that interpersonal aspects of reading (neuroticism and reading for companionship) and sociable aspects of movie viewing (openness, agreeableness, extraversion, and viewing to be sociable) lead to greater experience of the dimensions of parasocial interaction. We suggest that these factors relate to the availability of interactive media and experiences surrounding this series, and the series representing mainstream rather than subcultural media. Results support the suggestion that parasocial interaction is multidimensional and demonstrate that factors predicting these dimensions may vary dependent on the medium in which the favored persona is presented, or on the identity of the favored persona. © 2017 American Psychological Association.","Harry potter; Motives; Parasocial; Parasocial interaction; Personality",,,,,,"University of Bedfordshire","This work was completed with the support of funding from the University of Bedfordshire’s Research Centre for Applied Psychology.",,"Auter, P.J., TV that talks back: An experimental validation of a Parasocial Interaction Scale (1992) Journal of Broadcasting and Electronic Media, 36, pp. 173-181. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/08838159209364165; Baek, Y.M., Bae, Y., Jang, H., Social and parasocial relationships on social networking sites and their differential relationships with users' psychological well-being (2013) Cyberpsychology, Behavior, and Social Networking, 16, pp. 512-517. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1089/cyber.2012.0510; Cohen, J., Parasocial breakups: Measuring individual differences in responses to dissolution of parasocial relationship (2003) Mass Communication and Society, 6, pp. 191-202. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1207/S15327825MCS0602_5; Conway, J.C., Rubin, A.M., Psychological predictors of television viewing motivation (1991) Communication Research, 18, pp. 443-463. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/009365091018004001; De Backer, C.J.S., Blinded by the starlight: An evolutionary framework for studying celebrity culture and fandom (2012) Review of General Psychology, 16, pp. 144-151. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/a0027909; Derrick, J.L., Gabriel, S., Tippin, B., Parasocial relationships and self-discrepancies: Faux relationships have benefits for low self-esteem individuals (2008) Personal Relationships, 15, pp. 261-280. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1475-6811.2008.00197.x; Donohew, L., Palmgreen, P., Rayburn, J.D., II, Social and psychological origins of media use: A lifestyle analysis (1987) Journal of Broadcasting and Electronic Media, 31, pp. 255-278. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/08838158709386663; Eyal, K., Cohen, J., When good friends say goodbye: A parasocial breakup study (2006) Journal of Broadcasting and Electronic Media, 50, pp. 502-523. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1207/s15506878jobem5003_9; Finn, S., Origins of media exposure: Linking personality traints to TV, radio, print, and film use (1997) Communication Research, 24, pp. 507-529. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/009365097024005003; Finn, S., Gorr, M.B., Social isolation and social support as correlates of television viewing motivations (1988) Communication Research, 15, pp. 135-158. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/009365088015002002; Gabriel, S., Young, A.F., Becoming a vampire without being bitten: The narrative collective-assimilation hypothesis (2011) Psychological Science, 22, pp. 990-994. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0956797611415541; Giles, D.C., Parasocial interaction: A review of the literature and a model for future research (2002) Media Psychology, 4, pp. 279-305. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1207/S1532785XMEP0403_04; Grant, A.E., Guthrie, K.K., Ball-Rokeach, S.J., Television shopping: A media system dependency perspective (1991) Communication Research, 18, pp. 773-798. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/009365091018006004; Hoffner, C.A., Cohen, E.L., Responses to obsessive compulsive disorder on Monk among series fans: Parasocial relations, presumed media influence, and behavioral outcomes (2012) Journal of Broadcasting and Electronic Media, 56, pp. 650-668. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/08838151.2012.732136; Horton, D., Wohl, R.R., Mass communication and para-social interaction; observations on intimacy at a distance (1956) Psychiatry: Journal for the Study of Interpersonal Processes, 19, pp. 215-229. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00332747.1956.11023049; Hu, M., The influence of a scandal on parasocial relationship, parasocial interaction, and parasocial breakup (2016) Psychology of Popular Media Culture, 5, pp. 217-231. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/ppm0000068; Katz, E., Blumler, J.G., Gurevitch, M., Utilization of mass communication by the individual (1974) The uses of mass communication: Current perspectives on gratifications research, pp. 21-32. , J.

Drawing upon literature from communication, political psychology, and humor research, we explain how the psychological profiles of conservatives may render them less motivated to process and appreciate certain forms of humor compared to liberals. We test these propositions with an experiment that employs a two condition within-subjects experiment on a national sample (N = 305) to assess appreciation and comprehension of ironic and exaggerated humor among liberals and conservatives. Mediating effects of psychological traits are tested. Findings suggest that conservatives are less appreciative of both irony and exaggeration than liberals. In both cases, the effect is explained in part by lower sense of humor and need for cognition found among conservative participants. Results are explored in terms of the implications for political discourse, political polarization, and democratic practices. © 2017 American Psychological Association.","Humor; Need for cognition; Political ideology; Tolerance for ambiguity",,,,,,"Anhui University","This article was published Online First November 20, 2017.

There have also been various reviews of this literature (Collins, 2011; Furnham & Mak, 1999; Furnham & Paltzer, 2012; Grau & Zotos, 2016; Matthes, Prieler, & Adam, 2016). This paper looks specifically at the content-analytic studies done since 2000, and over 50 such studies from many different countries were found. These were examined to understand how the studies have, or have not, moved the literature and research on over the years both methodologically and theoretically. It also examined the nature of the current concerns in this literature. Various consistencies in the portrayal of the central character over all the studies done at different times and in different countries was noted. The central theoretical issue still concerns whether TV mirrors or molds sex roles in society; the motives and opinions of practitioners; and when and why there appear to be cultural and national differences and the general difficulty of doing good research in the area. © 2017 American Psychological Association.","Advertisements; Gender; Sex role; Stereotypes; TV",,,,,,,,,"Ahlstrand, M., Gender stereotyping in television advertising: A case of Austrian state television (Unpublished, Lulea Tekmiska Universitet) (2007), http://www.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1018680/FULLTEXT01.pdf; Arima, A., Gender stereotypes in Japanese television advertisements (2003) Sex Roles, 49, pp. 81-90. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1023965704387; Aronovsky, A., Furnham, A., Gender portrayals in food commercials at different times of the day: A content analytic study (2008) Communications, 33, pp. 169-190. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1515/COMMUN.2008.010; Arslan, E., A content analysis of male and female characters portrayed in Turkish television commercials (2015) Hitit Üniversitesi Sosyal Bilimler Enstitüsü Dergisi, 8, pp. 235-251. , http://dx.doi.org/10.17218/husbed.91416; Beasley, B., Standley, T.C., Shirts and skins: Clothing as an indicator of gender role stereotyping in video games (2002) Mass Communication Society, 5, pp. 279-293. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1207/S15327825MCS0503_3; Bresnahan, M.J., Inoue, Y., Liu, W.Y., Nishida, T., Changing gender roles in prime-time commercials in Malaysia, Japan, Taiwan, and the United States (2001) Sex Roles, 45, pp. 117-131. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1013068519583; Bretl, D.J., Cantor, J., The portrayal of men and women in U.S. television commercials: A recent content analysis and trends over 15 Years.

Although social comparison theory provides an empirically sound approach to these effects, we argue that additional insight may be offered by cultivation theory and its structured exploration of cognitive, attitudinal, and behavioral outcome variables. Thus, the present study scrutinizes the social network Instagram as a potential cultivation system for young adults' body image. Recruiting 228 participants aged 18 to 34 years, we systematically explore 3 orders of cultivation, that is, changes in weight-related knowledge, attitudes, and self-reported dietary restraint. As we differentiate between Instagram use quantity and quality, we observe that mere usage time cannot predict the assumed outcomes; instead, only participants' tendency to browse Instagram's public content emerges as a relevant predictor, connecting to biased views on the physical appearance of strangers as well as more disordered eating behavior. Considering the fact that Instagram use relates more to other-focused than to self-focused perceptions in our study, we argue that cultivation theory can indeed complement social comparison theory in the current understanding of media-transmitted body images. © 2019 American Psychological Association.","Body dissatisfaction; Body image; Cultivation theory; Disordered eating; Social media",,,,,,,,,,"Stein, J.-P.",,,"American Psychological Association Inc.",,,,,21604134,,,,"English","Psychol.

A systematic search was undertaken using Web of Science, PsycINFO, and PubMed databases to identify SNS usage and patterns, SNS features, and mediating factors contributing toward body image dissatisfaction, resulting in 40 studies meeting specific inclusion criteria. Findings identified passive SNS use and appearance-focused SNS use as particularly influential.

Analyzing data from an October 2018 experiment (N = 324), the research confirms that ideology, and in turn social identity, influences how viewers make sense of extreme comedy content drawn from Sacha Baron Cohen's Who Is America?

Integrative complexity is a linguistic variable developed by psychologists that measures differentiation at the lower levels and integration at the higher levels. Sampled from 40 horror films, the characters were compared based on gender, whether the character is the film's hero or monster/killer, and the critical response to the film (aggregate scores from Rotten Tomatoes). A random sample of dialogue from each character was collected and scored using Automated Integrative Complexity. A series of analyses of variance revealed the following: (a) No significant main effects for gender or the hero versus monster/killer condition. (b) A significant main effect for critical response: Rotten films scored lower than fresh films in terms of integrative complexity. (c) A significant interaction between gender and critical response: Fresh films featured male characters with significantly higher integrative complexity scores than the female characters, whereas there was no significant difference between female and male characters in rotten films. These findings provide insight into the underlying psychology of horror films and critical response, implying that complex male characters are associated with positive reviews, whereas female characters may be incidental to success in this context. © 2019 American Psychological Association.","Gender; Gender differences; Horror; Integrative complexity; Linguistics",,,,,,,,,,"McCullough, H.",,,"American Psychological Association Inc.",,,,,21604134,,,,"English","Psychol.

Study 1 conditions varied in linguistic cues (accurate spelling, one error, and multiple errors), and Study 2 conditions varied in emotional cues (no emoji, one happy emoji, and multiple happy emoji). Study 1 found linguistic accuracy was related to perceptions of target extraversion. Specifically, the target was rated more extraverted in the control condition, with no errors relative to a single error condition. Study 2 results suggested that emoji cues did not have any significant impact upon trait perceptions.

We, therefore, performed computational text analysis using 179,350 English-written comments on the Facebook page for fans of a globally emerging K-pop boyband Bangtan Sonyeondan from May 2013 to March 2018. This study found the following: (a) that the first-person plural pronoun ""we"" was on the rise in the linguistic organizing, (b) that we-words were more likely to be paired with words about interpersonal processes rather than ones about intrapersonal processes, and (c) that the primacy given to ""we"" for self-referencing over ""I"" predicted the greater level of group interactions, manifested by giving a ""like"" to or making a ""comment"" on messages from each other.

It was also explored how people change the visual properties of selfies for different situations. A total of 75 participants took two selfies of themselves in two scenarios: either for a curriculum vitae (CV) for a job application or for a dating website. Participants' personality characteristics of warmth and dominance were also recorded. Differences in the two scenarios showed that participants were more likely to rotate their head slightly for the dating scenario than for the CV scenario, and they were also more likely to use a lower camera angle for the CV scenario than the dating scenario, suggesting that they were aware that a lower camera angle makes one appear more dominant. Personality characteristics correlated with elevation of the selfies. People who were more dominant tended to use a higher camera angle, which, ironically, previous research shows produces an image that appears less dominant.

Seventy-one participants completed daily records over 14 days and reported their subjective frequency of engaging in different Facebook activity categories (i.e., exploring, sharing, liking, and friending), their motivation for engaging in these activities, and their daily well-being.

Most of these studies focused on pleasurable, hedonic entertainment experiences (i.e., enjoyment). However, scholarship increasingly acknowledges that digital games can also offer more profound (eudaimonic) entertainment experiences, characterized by the feeling of being moved and the experience of meaningfulness (i.e., appreciation). Knowledge about the antecedents of this form of digital game entertainment experiences is still sparse; thus, the present study investigates the role of well-established gaming gratifications for the emergence of both enjoyment and appreciation. In addition, trait-like preferences for eudaimonic and hedonic entertainment (i.e., entertainment motivations) are investigated as possible antecedents of players' entertainment experiences. Empirically, the study builds on a 2-wave online survey of U.S. players of the action-roleplaying game Mass Effect: Andromeda (n = 1,074). The findings show that obtained gaming-specific gratifications are closely related to players' enjoyment but also to their appreciation of the game.

Results indicated a variance of opinions. About 60.8% of scholars agreed pathological gaming could be a mental health problem, whereas 30.4% were skeptical.

More scholars worried about both the DSM and WHO criteria overpathologizing normal youth than those who were not worried about the same. Scholars were likewise split over whether the DSM/WHO had precipitated moral panics over video games. Belief in pathological gaming was positively predicted by hostile attitudes toward children and negatively by participants' experience with games.

Individuals who play role-playing video games (RPGs) have usually been excluded from these studies. This is because RPGs traditionally contained no action components and were thus not expected to influence cognitive performance. However, modern RPGs increasingly include numerous action-like components. We therefore examined whether current RPG players (RPGPs) perform similar to action video game players (AVGPs) or nonvideo game players (NVGPs) on two cognitive tasks. Self-identified AVGPs (N = 76), NVGPs (N = 77), and RPGPs (N = 23) completed two online cognitive tasks: A useful field of view (UFOV) task and a multiple-object tracking task (MOT). The UFOV task measures the ability to deploy visuospatial attention over a large field of view while dividing one's attention between a central and a peripheral task. The MOT task measures the ability to use attentional control to dynamically refresh information in working memory. RPGPs performed similar to AVGPs and better than NVGPs on both tasks. However, patterns of covariation (e.g., gender and age) presented obstacles to interpretation in some cases. Our study is the first to demonstrate that RPGPs show similar cognitive performance to AVGPs. These findings suggest that regularly playing modern RPGs may enhance visuospatial abilities. However, because the current study was purely cross-sectional, intervention studies will be needed to assess causation. We discuss the implications of this finding, as well as considerations for how gamers are classified going forward. © 2019 American Psychological Association.","Action video games; Multiple object tracking; Real-time strategy video games; Role-playing video games; Useful field of view",,,,,,,,,,"Dale, G.",,,"American Psychological Association Inc.",,,,,21604134,,,,"English","Psychol.

Perceived realism was tested as a variable that may explain the relationship between reality TV consumption and endorsement of stereotypes.

Additionally, we hypothesized that consumption of BORT and endorsement of perceived realism would be predictive of endorsement of stereotypes of Black women. Results from a sample of 115 Black female participants ( Mage = 22.33) revealed that those sampled indeed spent most of their TV viewing time watching reality TV including, particularly, shows with primarily Black casts.

Then, we examined their cyberbullying behavior and attitudes longitudinally at points before the intervention (Wave 1), immediately after it (Wave 2), and 2 months later (Wave 3). The results suggest that our intervention was successful, as there was a significant reduction in anonymity perceptions and toxic online disinhibition from Wave 1 to Wave 2 in the intervention group.

Playful competition facilitates moral learning, rewards perspective-taking skills, and challenges children to healthily regulate unpleasant emotions such as frustration, anger, and jealousy. Despite this, research on the effects of competitive video gaming has focused on antisocial outcomes, such as declines in prosocial behavior. Moreover, methodological shortcomings such as experimental studies using designs with poor generalizability, and a lack of longitudinal studies, leave open the influence of competitive gaming on social development among preadolescent children. This longitudinal study therefore investigated the relation between competitive gaming and changes in children's social development across 3 measures: conduct problems, peer relations, and prosocial behavior. At 2 timepoints, 1 year apart, 184 Dutch children (8.31-12.68 years old) reported their gaming frequency and listed their favorite games to play, and their parents reported their children's psychosocial health. Children's nominations were coded as including or not including a competitive video game. Children who nominated a competitive game at the first time point were more likely to show a decrease in conduct problems and an improvement in peer relations. No interactions were observed between competitive gaming and gaming frequency. These results encourage future research to investigate the social benefits of playful competitive gaming among peers, and for future studies to take other variables such as violent content, cooperative play, and real world competitive play into account. © 2017 American Psychological Association.","Child development; Competitive play; Gaming; Peer relations; Prosocial behavior",,,,,,,,,"Adachi, P.J.C., (2015) Demolishing the competition: The association between competitive video game play and aggression among adolescents and young adults (Doctoral thesis), , Brock University Library, St. Catharines, Ontario, Canada; Adachi, P.J.C., Willoughby, T., The effect of video game competition and violence on aggressive behavior: Which characteristic has the greatest influence?

Nevertheless, previous research suggests that SNS use is related to increased face-to-face communication. The present study was conducted to determine whether personality traits and attachment styles moderate this relationship. Students (n = 855) completed an online survey that included measures of Facebook use, time spent engaging in face-to-face communication, personality traits, and attachment styles. The results revealed that Facebook use was associated with increased face-to-face communication and that this relationship was moderated by extraversion. Specifically, the relationship between Facebook use and face-to-face communication was significant for individuals with low to moderate levels of extraversion (i.e., introverts) only. As extraversion increased, the magnitude of the relationship between Facebook use and face-to-face time decreased. No other personality traits or attachment styles significantly moderated the relationship between Facebook use and face-to-face communication. Facebook (and potentially SNSs more generally) may be especially beneficial for introverts by allowing them to build trust and rapport in a less threatening social environment that, in turn, makes them more comfortable engaging in face-to-face communication. However, research is needed to understand the direction and mechanisms underlying this relationship.

Recently, significant associations among nighttime cellphone use, compulsive orientation toward cellphone use, and multiple characteristics of compromised sleep were found in a sample of undergraduate students enrolled at a small liberal arts college (Murdock, Horissian, & Crichlow-Ball, 2016). The current study expands upon these findings. Data were collected from 2 samples of undergraduates: 273 students enrolled at a midsized state university and 152 self-identified students recruited through Mechanical Turk. Hierarchical regression analyses were conducted to test the hypotheses that nighttime cellphone notifications and qualities of compulsive cellphone use would predict sleep problems and daytime sleepiness, even after taking into account the overall frequency of cellphone use. Full support for hypotheses was found for both domains of sleep-related functioning in both samples. Findings suggest that contextual aspects of cellphone use, such as its timing and compulsivity, may be more important to emerging adults' sleep than aspects of cellphone use such as the number of texts or time spent on calls. Sleep promotion programs for emerging adults should target specific cellphone use qualities-that is, the when, where, and how of cellphone use-to promote behavior change and improved sleep. © 2017 American Psychological Association.","Cellphone; Compulsive; Emerging adulthood; Sleep",,,,,,"Washington and Lee University, W&L","This research was supported by the Washington and Lee University Lenfest Sabbatical Award, Lenfest Summer Grant Program, David G.",,"Adams, S.K., Kisler, T.S., Sleep quality as a mediator between technology-related sleep quality, depression, and anxiety (2013) Cyberpsychology, Behavior, and Social Networking, 16, pp. 25-30. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1089/cyber.2012.0157; Anderson, M., (2015) Technology Device Ownership: 2015, , http://www.pewinternet.org/2015/10/29/technologydevice-ownership-2015/, October 29; Augner, C., Hacker, G.W., Associations between problematic mobile phone use and psychological parameters in young adults (2012) International Journal of Public Health, 57, pp. 437-441. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00038-011-0234-z; Behrend, T.S., Sharek, D.J., Meade, A.W., Wiebe, E.N., The viability of crowdsourcing for survey research (2011) Behavior Research Methods, 43, pp. 800-813. , http://dx.doi.org/10.3758/s13428-011-0081-0; Bianchi, A., Phillips, J.G., Psychological predictors of problem mobile phone use (2005) Cyberpsychology & Behavior, 8, pp. 39-51. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1089/cpb.2005.8.39; Billieux, J., Problematic use of the mobile phone: A literature review and a pathways model (2012) Current Psychiatry Reviews, 8, pp. 299-307. , http://dx.doi.org/10.2174/157340012803520522; Billieux, J., Van Der Linden, M., Rochat, L., The role of impulsivity in actual and problematic use of the mobile phone (2008) Applied Cognitive Psychology, 22, pp. 1195-1210. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/acp.1429; Buhrmester, M., Kwang, T., Gosling, S.D., Amazon's Mechanical Turk: A new source of inexpensive, yet high-quality, data?

Participants reported stronger PSR and identification with the more familiar characters from the first trilogy than with the new characters introduced in the film, although the association with identification was limited to older participants. Star Wars fanship was associated with identification and PSR for old and new characters. Familiarity with the earlier films was associated with PSR of old and new characters and with identification with the old characters. Participants were more likely to cite characters of the same gender as the one to which they felt most connected, but among the ""most connected"" newer characters a viewer- character gender match was not associated with stronger identification or PSR. Identification, but not PSR, with the story antagonist was associated with greater hedonic enjoyment and appreciation.

Some programs feature the sound of audience laughter, whereas others display social media comments that praise programing. What happens, however, when viewers' comments on social media are negative? Can the presence of laugh tracks buffer hostile comments' negative effects? An experiment (N = 184) was conducted to answer these questions using a 3 (comment valence: positive vs. negative vs. control) × 2 (laugh track: present vs. absent) between-subjects design. Negative comments decreased program perceptions via the mediating pathway of bandwagon support. The presence of a laugh track did not moderate effects. The theoretical and practical implications of these findings for new media effects are discussed. © 2017 American Psychological Association.","Comments; Enjoyment; Laugh track; MAIN model; Social TV",,,,,,,,,"Brown, G.E., Dixon, P.A., Hudson, J.D., Effect of peer pressure on imitation of humor response in college students (1982) Psychological Reports, 51, pp. 1111-1117. , http://dx.doi.org/10.2466/pr0.1982.51.3f.1111; Busselle, R., Bilandzic, H., Measuring narrative engagement (2009) Media Psychology, 12, pp. 321-347. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15213260903287259; Cameron, J., Geidner, N., Something old, something new, something borrowed from something blue: Experiments on dual viewing and twitter (2014) Journal of Broadcasting & Electronic Media, 58, pp. 400-419. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/08838151.2014.935852; Chapman, A.J., Social facilitation of laughter in children (1973) Journal of Experimental Social Psychology, 9, pp. 528-541. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0022-1031(73)90035-8; Chapman, A.J., Humor and laughter in social interaction and some implications for humor research (1983) Handbook of humor research, pp. 135-157. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4612-5572-7_7, In P.

Past research has demonstrated that playing a violent video game for short periods decreases subsequent prefrontal activity during inhibition, yet the impact of long-term game play is unclear. To assess how extensive video game play impacts brain activity, young adult males (n = 49; ages 18-29) with limited video game experience performed a go/no-go task during fMRI for 3 consecutive weeks. Following a baseline scan, these men were randomly assigned to extensively play a violent video game (VG) or avoid all video game play (control) during the subsequent week. After 1 week, inhibition-related activity decreased in right inferior frontal gyrus and right cerebellum in the VG group, compared to the control sample, and self-reported executive functioning problems were higher. VG participants assigned to a second week of game play had similarly reduced bilateral prefrontal activity during inhibition, relative to the control group. However, VG participants assigned to avoid game play or play a cognitive training game during the second week demonstrated similar overall changes from baseline as the control group. This research provides preliminary evidence indicating how long-term video game play may impact brain function during inhibition, which may impair control of aggressive behavior. © 2017 American Psychological Association.","Cognitive control; FMRI; Media violence; Prefrontal cortex; Video game",,,,,,,,,"Anderson, C.A., Berkowitz, L., Donnerstein, E., Huesmann, L.R., Johnson, J.D., Linz, D., Wartella, E., The influence of media violence on youth (2003) Psychological Science in the Public Interest, 4, pp. 81-110; Anderson, C.A., Bushman, B.J., Effects of violent video games on aggressive behavior, aggressive cognition, aggressive affect, physiological arousal, and prosocial behavior: A meta-analytic review of the scientific literature (2001) Psychological Science, 12, pp. 353-359. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1467-9280.00366; Anderson, C.A., Dill, K.E., Video games and aggressive thoughts, feelings, and behavior in the laboratory and in life.

This study also considered the link between self-perception and photos of oneself that were not selfies (""posies"") to determine if there were intrapersonal implications of selfies versus other self-displays on the popular social media platform, Instagram. Participants with both self-report and observational data were 100 (20 males, 80 female) undergraduates. Selfies and posies were coded according to their frequency relative to participants' posts that did not include their own image and according to themes (i.e., physical appearance, event/activity/ location, affiliation with others, collage, other/undifferentiated). Overall, such posts were not associated with narcissism or self-esteem, with some specific themes showing small correlations with narcissism and concerns regarding societal attitudes about appearance. Some aspects of participants' Instagram activity (i.e., number of likes for selfies and posies; number of followers) were significantly correlated with posting posies. The implications of these findings for research methodology on social media behavior and in the connection between self-perception and photo sharing on social media are discussed. © 2017 American Psychological Association.","Narcissism; Self-esteem; Selfies; Social media",,,,,,,,,"Barakat, C., Science links selfies to narcissism, addiction, and low self-esteem (2014) Social Times, , http://www.adweek.com/socialtimes/selfies-narcissism-addiction-low-self-esteem/147769, April 16; Barry, C.T., Doucette, H., Loflin, D.C., Rivera-Hudson, N.J., Herrington, L.L., 'Let me take a selfie:' Associations between self-photography, narcissism, and self-esteem (2017) Psychology of Popular Media Culture, 6, pp. 48-60. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/ppm0000089; Barry, C.T., Kauten, R.L., Nonpathological and pathological narcissism: Which self-reported characteristics are most problematic in adolescents?

However, understanding of the value outside observers place on social media status cues (i.e., followers, likes, etc.) in evaluating the perceived likability of others is currently underexplored. Using the theoretical lenses of social exchange and social information processing, we developed a conjoint experiment relating observers' expected likability of social media users with variance in a social media user's (1) number of followers and ""likes"", (2) physical attractiveness, (3) and the percentage of ""selfies"" (self-portraits) posted. Data collected from 72 participants and 873 generated observations provided results consistent with our theory that those with more followers and ""likes"" have higher perceived likability. In addition, this perception was further enhanced by physical attractiveness, but diminished by the percentage of ""selfies"" posted. Of additional interest, we also found that likability differed by gender, age, and the amount of time spent on social media.

The current study reports on the development and validation of a parent-report measure of one potential aspect of children's problematic use-screen media addiction-via the Problematic Media Use Measure (PMUM). Items were based on the 9 criteria for Internet gaming disorder in the DSM-5. The first study describes the development and preliminary validation of the PMUM in a sample of 291 mothers. Mothers (80.8% identified as White) of children aged four through 11 years of age completed the PMUM, and measures of child screen time and child psychosocial functioning. Exploratory factor analyses indicated a unidimensional construct of screen media addiction. The final versions of the PMUM (27 items) and PMUM Short Form (PMUM-SF; 9 items) evidenced high internal consistency (Cronbach's α = .97 and α = .93, respectively). Regression analyses were conducted to examine the convergent validity of the PMUM with indicators of child psychosocial functioning. Convergent validity was supported, and the PMUM scales also independently predicted children's total difficulties in functioning, over and above hours of screen time, indicating incremental validity. The second study sought to confirm the factor structure of the PMUM-SF and test for measurement invariance across gender. In a sample of 632 parents, we confirmed the factor structure of the PMUM-SF and found measurement invariance for boys and girls. These studies support the use of the PMUM-SF as a measure of screen media addiction in children aged 4 through 11 years old. © 2017 American Psychological Association.","Children; Internet gaming disorder; Mobile device; Problematic media use; Screen addiction",,,,,,"National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, NICHD: R01HD061356, F32HD085684","This study was supported by the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, grant F32HD085684 and R01HD061356.

Theoretically, individuals are motivated to use Facebook in their relationships to increase feelings of belongingness, which is a fundamental human need. Yet, past studies have neither examined the perceptions of Facebook's influence on increasing closeness in romantic relationships, nor simultaneously examined a wide range of Facebook behaviors that involve romantic partners. Using a belongingness/connection framework, 2 studies examined associations between romantic relationship-oriented Facebook activities, relationship satisfaction, and the perceived effects of Facebook on relationships. Study 1 (N = 93) and Study 2 (N = 255) both illustrated that relationship satisfaction was positively associated with publicly displaying one's relationship on Facebook but was negatively correlated with displaying more affection on Facebook than the participants normally display offline (excessive displays). Study 2 showed that public displays and private communication on Facebook were positively associated with the perception that Facebook had improved the relationship, and excessive displays of the relationship were perceived as beneficial only for those reporting low relationship satisfaction. Additionally, for those who experienced low levels of jealousy, monitoring was associated with perceptions that Facebook had helped their relationships. For those who experienced high levels of jealousy on Facebook, monitoring was unrelated to perceptions that Facebook improved the relationship. Findings provide evidence that feelings of disconnection from one's partner could motivate excessive relationship displays on Facebook and that the perceived effect of Facebook on romantic relationships depends on how Facebook is used, which could promote or hinder relationship quality. © 2017 American Psychological Association.","Belonging; Facebook; Relationship satisfaction; Social media",,,,,,,,,"Aiken, L.S., West, S.G., (1991) Multiple regression: Testing and interpreting interactions, , Newbury Park, CA: Sage; Aron, A., Aron, E.N., Smollan, D., Inclusion of other in the self scale and the structure of interpersonal closeness (1992) Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 63, pp. 596-612. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/0022-3514.63.4.596; Aron, A., Aron, E.N., Tudor, M., Nelson, G., Close relationships as including other in the self (1991) Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 60, pp. 241-253. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/0022-3514.60.2.241; Baumeister, R.F., Leary, M.R., The need to belong: Desire for interpersonal attachments as a fundamental human motivation (1995) Psychological Bulletin, 117, pp. 497-529. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/0033-2909.117.3.497; Billedo, C.J., Kerkhof, P., Finkenauer, C., The use of social networking sites for relationship maintenance in long-distance and geographically close romantic relationships (2015) Cyberpsychology, Behavior, and Social Networking, 18, pp. 152-157. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1089/cyber.2014.0469; Bradfield, A., Wells, G.L., Not the same old hindsight bias: Outcome information distorts a broad range of retrospective judgments (2005) Memory & Cognition, 33, pp. 120-130. , http://dx.doi.org/10.3758/BF03195302; Bryant, F.B., Yarnold, P.R., Principal-components analysis and exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis (1995) Reading and understanding multivariate statistics, pp. 99-136. , In L.

This study builds upon and unifies this work through the development of a generalized model of the antihero narrative enjoyment process. Participants (n = 234) viewed 1 of the 3 feature-length antihero films. The findings revealed a consistent enjoyment model that highlights the role of the individual-difference variable willingness to accept violence as a predictor of situational moral disengagement, leading to character identification and liking, which in turn predicted enjoyment. Furthermore, the study demonstrates that identification seems to be the process through which we build dispositions toward an antihero character, rather than moral judgments, extending previous research on the role of identification for antihero enjoyment. © 2017 American Psychological Association.","Affective disposition theory; Antiheroes; Enjoyment; Identification; Moral disengagement",,,,,,,,,"Appel, M., Richter, T., Transportation and need for affect in narrative persuasion: A mediated moderation model (2010) Media Psychology, 13, pp. 101-135. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15213261003.799847; Bandura, A., Moral disengagement in the perpetration of inhumanities (1999) Personality and Social Psychology Review, 3, pp. 193-209. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1207/s15327957pspr0303_3; Bandura, A., Barbaranelli, C., Caprara, G.V., Pastorelli, C., Mechanisms of moral disengagement in the exercise of moral agency (1996) Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 71, pp. 364-374. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/0022-3514.71.2.364; Besson, C., Besson, L., (1994) Léon: The professional [Motion picture], , United Kingdom: Buena Vista International; Buck, D.C., Juan Salvo y Vela and the rise of the comedia de magia: The magician as anti-hero (1986) Hispania, 69, pp. 251-261. , http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/341659; Chou, C.-P., Bentler, P.M., Estimation and tests in structural equation modeling (1995) Structural equation modeling: Concepts, issues, and applications, pp. 37-55. , R.

Because sexually objectifying images dehumanize and devalue women, perceivers were predicted to rate the spokeswoman as less competent. Female undergraduates in the United States participated in a laboratory experiment in which they either saw objectifying or control images of women before they listened to a speech by a spokeswoman who either had a lean or heavier body build. The spokeswoman's body build had no effect on her perceived competence. However, relative to controls, women who had first seen objectifying images of other women saw the spokeswoman as less effective and were less persuaded by her. The implications of these findings for objectification theory and advertising are discussed. © 2017 American Psychological Association.","Objectification; Persuasiveness; Speaker competence; Speech",,,,,,,,,"Archer, D., Iritani, B., Kimes, D.D., Barrios, M., Face-ism: Five studies of sex differences in facial prominence (1983) Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 45, pp. 725-735. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/0022-3514.45.4.725; Aubrey, J.S., Effects of sexually objectifying media on self-objectification and body surveillance in undergraduates: Results of a 2-Year Panel Study (2006) Journal of Communication, 56, pp. 366-386. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1460-2466.2006.00024.x; Aubrey, J.S., Frisby, C.M., Sexual objectification in music videos: A content analysis comparing gender and genre (2011) Mass Communication and Society, 14, pp. 475-501. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15205436.2010.513468; Aubrey, J.S., Gerding, A., The cognitive tax of self-objectification: Examining sexually objectifying music videos and female emerging adults' cognitive processing of subsequent advertising (2015) Journal of Media Psychology, 27, pp. 22-32. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1027/1864-1105/a000128; Aubrey, J.S., Henson, J.R., Hopper, K.M., Smith, S.E., A picture is worth twenty words (about the self): Testing the priming influence of visual sexual objectification on women's selfobjectification (2009) Communication Research Reports, 26, pp. 271-284. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/088240.90903293551; Bargh, J.A., Chartrand, T.L., The unbearable automaticity of being (1999) American Psychologist, 54, pp. 462-479. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/0003-066X.54.7.462; Bartky, S.L., (1990) Femininity and domination: Studies in the phenomenology of oppression, , New York, NY: Routledge; Bordo, S., (1993) Unbearable weight: Feminism, western culture, and the body, , Berkeley, CA: University of California Press; Brochu, P.M., Morrison, M.A., Implicit and explicit prejudice toward overweight and average-weight men and women: Testing their correspondence and relation to behavioral intentions (2007) The Journal of Social Psychology, 147, pp. 681-706. , http://dx.doi.org/10.3200/SOCP.147.6.681-706; Brown, F.L., Slaughter, V., Normal body, beautiful body: Discrepant perceptions reveal a pervasive 'thin ideal' from childhood to adulthood (2011) Body Image, 8, pp. 119-125. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bodyim.2011.02.002; Calogero, R.M., Objectification theory, selfobjectification, and body image.

Assumptions from entertainment theory and positive psychology served as theoretical basis. A curvilinear relationship between hedonic and eudaimonic entertainment experiences was found through an online survey (N = 675). The second study (N = 132) was an experiment in which hedonic entertainment experiences were manipulated. Again, a curvilinear relationship between both entertainment experiences was detected. Furthermore, entertainment experiences were associated with information processing in a meaningful pattern. These results point to the distinct relationships and effects of different forms of entertainment experiences. Implications for political media and entertainment education are discussed. © 2017 American Psychological Association.","Entertainment theory; Experiment; Information processing; Political entertainment; Survey",,,,,,"Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG: VO 551/15-1","The research described in this article was funded by the Deutsche Forschungs gemeinschaft (German Research Foundation, Project Number: VO 551/15-1).

In contrast to many common media theories focusing on the possible, one-directional influence of media on an individual's thoughts and behaviors, this study follows the more interactive tenants inherent to the Uses and Gratification Approach and the Media Practice Model. Consistent with study hypotheses, an individual's level of self-reported exposure to the books and films in each of these franchises-particularly high levels of repeated exposure-was related to the extent to which they perceived that franchise served to gratify at least 1 of the 5 possible SSUMs: Entertainment, Identity Formation, Sensation Seeking, Coping, and Cultural Identification. Although Entertainment was the SSUM most consistently associated with exposure level across the 3 franchises, the other SSUMs also evidenced significant interactions, including different interactions involving rereading the books or rewatching the films within a franchise. These findings not only contribute to ongoing theoretical discussions regarding the interactive nature of media influences but also provide the foundation for future research explicitly exploring the connection between SSUMs of fictional media and real-world experiences of the media consumer, particularly as it relates to issues of Identity Formation and Coping. © 2017 American Psychological Association.","Books; Films; Franchises; Self-socialization media use; Uses and gratification",,,,,,,,,"Anderson, C.A., Bushman, B.J., Effects of violent video games on aggressive behavior, aggressive cognition, aggressive affect, physiological arousal, and prosocial behavior: A meta-analytic review of the scientific literature (2002) Psychological Science, 12, pp. 353-359. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1467-9280.00366; Anderson, L., McCabe, D.B., A coconstructed world: Adolescent self-socialization on the internet (2012) Journal of Public Policy & Marketing, 31, pp. 240-253. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1509/jppm.08.043; Arnett, J.J., Adolescents' uses of media for self-socialization (1995) Journal of Youth and Adolescence, 24, pp. 519-533. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF01537054; Arnett, J.J., Emerging adulthood: Understanding the new way of coming of age (2006) Emerging adults in America: Coming of age in the 21st century, pp. 3-19. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/11381-001, J.

Study 1 is a correlational study showing that greater exposure to narcissistic reality TV while engaged in experience taking is related to higher levels of narcissism. Study 2 is an experimental study showing that participants randomly assigned to watch a narcissistic reality TV show, under conditions that encouraged experience taking, were more narcissistic.

Study 1 consisted of 75 parent- child dyads that completed measures to assess youth Internet behavior (including cyberbullying behavior and parental rules regarding Internet behaviors). Results showed that parents, on average, underestimated whether their children cyberbullied others and overestimated parental rule enforcement. Study 2 (N = 165 youth) used a correlational design to examine the relations between youth cyberbullying perpetration and parent Internet rules. Results showed that parental ignorance (how much parents are unaware of their child's Internet activities) positively correlated with cyberbullying behaviors. Finally, Study 3 (N = 96 youth) used a short-term longitudinal study using the same measure as Study 2 and found that Wave 1 parental ignorance was related to Time 2 cyberbullying perpetration. Overall, results suggest that the extent to which parents are unaware of their child's online behaviors positively predict cyberbullying perpetration. © 2017 American Psychological Association.","Cyber-aggression; Cyberbullying; Parent-child disconnect; Parental perceptions",,,,,,,,,"Ang, R.P., Goh, D.H., Cyberbullying among adolescents: The role of affective and cognitive empathy, and gender (2010) Child Psychiatry and Human Development, 41, pp. 387-397. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10578-010-0176-3; Barlett, C.P., Predicting adolescent's cyberbullying behavior: A longitudinal risk analysis (2015) Journal of Adolescence, 41, pp. 86-95. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.adolescence.2015.02.006; Barlett, C.P., Gentile, D.A., Attacking others online: The formation of cyber-bullying in late adolescence (2012) Psychology of Popular Media Culture, 1, pp. 123-135. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/a0028113; Barlett, C.P., Gentile, D.A., Anderson, C.A., Suzuki, K., Sakamoto, A., Yamaoka, A., Katsura, R., Cross-cultural differences in cyberbullying behavior: A short-term longitudinal study (2014) Journal of Cross-Cultural Psychology, 45, pp. 300-313. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0022022113504622; Barlett, C.P., Gentile, D.A., Chew, C., Predicting cyber-bullying from anonymity (2016) Psychology of Popular Media Culture, 5, pp. 171-180; Bauman, S., Cyberbullying in a rural intermediate school: An exploratory study (2010) The Journal of Early Adolescence, 30, pp. 803-833. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0272431609350927; Beale, A.V., Hall, K.R., Cyberbullying: What school administrators (and parents) can do (2007) The Clearing House: A Journal of Educational Strategies, Issues and Ideas, 81, pp. 8-12. , http://dx.doi.org/10.3200/TCHS.81.1.8-12; Cassidy, W., Jackson, M., Brown, K.N., Sticks and stones can break my bones, but how can pixels hurt me?: Students' experiences with cyberbullying (2009) School Psychology International, 30, pp. 383-402. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/014303430.9106948; Hemphill, S.A., Kotevski, A., Heerde, J.A., Longitudinal associations between cyber-bullying perpetration and victimization and problem behavior and mental health problems in young Australians (2015) International Journal of Public Health, 60, pp. 227-237. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00038-014-0644-9; Kowalski, R.M., Giumetti, G.W., Schroeder, A.N., Lattanner, M.R., Bullying in the digital age: A critical review and meta-analysis of cyberbullying research among youth (2014) Psychological Bulletin, 140, pp. 1073-1137. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/a0035618; Lee, S., Parental restrictive mediation of children's Internet use: Effective for what and for whom?

Previous psychological research presents a contradicting picture. While Tetlock's value pluralism model (Tetlock, 1986) and research focused on the complexity of lying (Repke, Conway, & Houck, in press; Newman, Pennebaker, Berry, & Richards, 2003) would argue against fiction being a reflection, the concept of prototypes (Rosch, 1978) argues for it. The subsequent paper presents 2 studies that hopefully provide a clearer picture and an answer to the aforementioned question by comparing the integrative complexity of fictional characters to their real-life counterparts. Study 1 utilized a deep-but-narrow approach, comparing a single salient, prototypical category, while Study 2 utilized the opposite approach, comparing 10 varied, prototypical categories. Overall, both Study 1's and Study 2's result upheld a clear, overwhelming divergence between fiction and reality (the fictional characters were consistently simpler than the nonfictional characters); however, an intraclass correlation in Study 2 revealed surprising and significant levels of overlap between fiction and reality that differed depending on the unique category. While this research is still too raw and novel to do more than speculate on the exact reasoning behind the differing levels of overlap, the mere existence of the levels of overlap themselves indicate a nuanced answer to the research question. Fiction is both psychologically a representation of reality and a divergence from it. © 2017 American Psychological Association.","Fiction; Integrative complexity; Lying; Prototypes; Reality",,,,,,,,,"(1948) The politics of Aristotle (E, , Barker, Trans.).

The current study employed a short-term longitudinal design with US youth (average age = 14.34 years) to examine a possible expansion of the Barlett and Gentile Cyberbullying Model (BGCM)-a learning-based social model focused on predicting cyberbullying perpetration from procyberbullying attitudes, anonymity perceptions, and the belief that physical stature is irrelevant online. We tested whether online disinhibition could add more predictive power to this model. Participants (N = 145) completed measures of these aforementioned constructs at baseline and again 6 months later. Results showed that the original derivation of the BGCM was replicated; however, online disinhibition did not predict cyberbullying attitudes longitudinally. This suggests that online disinhibition, although correlated with cyberbullying perpetration, is not likely a learned consequence of continued cyberbullying. © 2017 American Psychological Association.","Anonymity; Cyberbullying; Cyberbullying attitudes; Online disinhibition",,,,,,,,,"Ajzen, I., Fishbein, M., Attitude-behavior relations: A theoretical analysis and review of empirical research (1977) Psychological Bulletin, 84, pp. 888-918. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/0033-2909.84.5.888; Barlett, C.P., Predicting adolescent's cyberbullying behavior: A longitudinal risk analysis (2015) Journal of Adolescence, 41, pp. 86-95. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.adolescence.2015.02.006; Barlett, C.P., Past, present, and future theoretical developments in predicting cyberbullying behavior (2016) A socio-ecological approach to cyberbullying, pp. 13-28. , M.

Various predictors of dating violence have been studied, but few studies have considered the role of media outside of aggressive media consumption. Based on the Media Practice Model (Steele & Brown, 1995), the present study examined measures of early experiences (e.g., family relationships, peer support of aggression), individual factors (e.g., religiosity, self-esteem, dating and sexual experiences), media use (identification, influence, and preference for aggressive media), as well as attitudes supportive of violence and dating violence victimization and perpetration. Participants were 417 emerging adults (71% female) who completed an online survey. The majority of the sample had both experienced and perpetrated some type of dating violence. The final multigroup structural equation model fit the data adequately with relatively few gender differences. Having more conflict-laden, less supportive early family relationships was related to numerous risk factors (e.g., less religiosity, having peers who were more supportive of aggression, lower self-esteem), which generally related to the media variables, specifically greater identification with people in the media, as well as more influence by and preference for aggressive media. In general, there was evidence that media use mediated the relationships between early lived experience, individual factors, and attitudes accepting of aggression in relationships, as well as overall experience with dating violence. Implications for future research and preventative programing including conflict resolution training and media literacy programing for both young people and families, are discussed. © 2017 American Psychological Association.","Dating violence; Emerging adults; Media practice model",,,,,,,,,"Abbey, A., McAuslan, P., Ross, L.T., Sexual assault perpetration by college men: The role of alcohol, misperception of sexual intent, and sexual beliefs and experiences (1998) Journal of Social and Clinical Psychology, 17, pp. 167-195. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1521/jscp.1998.17.2.167; Ackard, D.M., Neumark-Sztainer, D., Date violence and date rape among adolescents: Associations with disordered eating behaviors and psychological health (2002) Child Abuse & Neglect: The International Journal, 26, pp. 455-473. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0145-2134(02)00322-8; Acock, A.C., (2013) Discovering structural equation modeling using Stata (Rev, , College Station, TX: Stata Press; Anderson, C.A., Bushman, B.J., Human aggression (2002) Annual Review of Psychology, 53, pp. 27-51. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1146/annurev.psych.53.100901.135231; Anderson, C.A., Bushman, B.J., Donnerstein, E., Hummer, T.A., Warburton, W., SPSSI research summary on media violence (2015) Analyses of Social Issues and Public Policy, 15, pp. 4-19. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/asap.12093; Arnett, J.J., Emerging adulthood.

Adolescent and emerging adult women (n = 259) viewed and responded to randomly selected music videos. Results from MANCOVA indicate that viewers' perceptions of women in music videos differed by age/social context and, after accounting for their perceptions of the videos' entertainment value and realism, differed within the music video sets. College women were more likely than high-school-aged women to perceive women in music videos as attractive and powerful. Viewers were more likely to perceive women in music videos to be attractive when they also perceived them to be sexual objects but not when they perceived the women in music videos to be powerful. Hierarchical regression analyses revealed that participants who accepted sexual objectification and who were entertained by the music videos were less likely to be offended by nonphysical potentially offensive sexual behaviors (POSB) such as dirty jokes or cat calls. Women who accepted sexual objectification of women and perceived the music videos to be realistic were less likely to be offended by physical POSB (e.g., being touched or grabbed, unwanted sexual advances). Results suggest that personal attitudes and finding music videos to be entertaining or realistic may together inform attitudes that normalize the acceptance of POSB. © 2017 American Psychological Association.","Adolescents and media; Gender issues; Harassment; Sexual objectification; Sexual violence",,,,,,,,,"Hostile hallways: Bullying, teasing, and sexual harassment in school (2001) Report commissioned by the American Association of University Women Educational Foundation, , http://www.ccasa.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/AAUW-Hostile-hallways-report.pdf, J.

Employing a data-driven approach, the present study examines the nature of images and text contained within #fitspiration posts on social media. First, a content analysis of images labeled as #fitspiration on popular site Instagram (N = 1,000) was performed. People featured in 52% of images, of which nearly 90% of individuals were coded as having low body fat and 55% were coded as muscular. Individuals were typically presented in sexually objectified ways, which varied as a function of gender. Second, a thematic analysis of text from the same set of images (N = 400) was conducted to identify common themes and underlying meaning embedded within the messages. Six themes were developed: (a) Fit is sexy, (b) A ""fit"" physique requires commitment and self-regulation, (c) Your choices define you, (d) Pleasure and perseverance through pain, (e) Battle of the selves: You versus you, and (f) Here's to us! A celebration of a community. In combination, the analyses demonstrate how text and images found in #fitspiration posts perpetuate pervading sociocultural appearance ideals for men and women, positioning exercise as means to achieving these ideals. Furthermore, #fitspiration sexually objectifies the fit body, with text and images encouraging self-objectification and the distancing of the self from internal bodily functions in physical activity settings. Future research should focus on how #fitspiration content influences individuals in relation to how they think and feel about their body and physical activity. © 2017 American Psychological Association.","#fitspiration content; Body image; Fitness; Objectification; Social media",,,,,,,,,"Aubrey, J.S., Looking good versus feeling good: An investigation of media frames of health advice and their effects on women's body-related self-perceptions (2010) Sex Roles, 63, pp. 50-63. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11199-010-9768-4; Aubrey, J.S., Frisby, C.M., Sexual objectification in music videos: A content analysis comparing gender and genre (2011) Mass Communication and Society, 14, pp. 475-501. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15205436.2010.513468; Boepple, L., Thompson, J.K., A content analysis of healthy living blogs: Evidence of content thematically consistent with dysfunctional eating attitudes and behaviors (2014) International Journal of Eating Disorders, 47, pp. 362-367. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/eat.22244; Boepple, L., Thompson, J.K., A content analytic comparison of fitspiration and thinspiration websites (2016) International Journal of Eating Disorders, 49, pp. 98-101. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/eat.22403; Borzekowski, D.L., Schenk, S., Wilson, J.L., Peebles, R., e-Ana and e-Mia: A content analysis of pro-eating disorder Web sites (2010) American Journal of Public Health, 100, pp. 1526-1534. , http://dx.doi.org/10.2105/AJPH.2009.172700; Braun, V., Clarke, V., Using thematic analysis in psychology (2006) Qualitative Research in Psy-chology, 3, pp. 77-101. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1191/1478088706qp063oa; Buysse, J.A.M., Embser-Herbert, M.S., Constructions of gender in sport: An analysis of intercollegiate media guide cover photographs (2004) Gender and Society, 18, pp. 66-81. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0891243203257914; Calogero, R.M., Tantleff-Dunn, S., Thompson, J.K., Objectification theory: An introduction (2011) Self-objectification in women: Causes, consequences, and counteractions, pp. 3-21. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/12304-001, R.

Using the differential susceptibility to media effects model as a framework, we draw from research on sensitivity theory and uses and gratifications to test whether unintentional binges are more likely to result in addiction symptoms, and whether this is due to impulsivity as a personality trait. Using an online survey, we find (a) most of our sample has engaged in both types of binge watching, (b) addiction symptoms were more common after unintentional binges, and (c) impulsivity exerts an indirect effect on addiction in the case of unintentional binging only, by increasing unintentional binging frequency.

However, the increasing amount of time spent on these games each day raised fears that this comes at the expense of school and, over the long run, impairs academic achievement. Extending prior research, the present study on a sample of N = 3,554 German adolescents (56% girls) adopted a prospective design and examined the effects of the time playing computer games each day on grades and domain-specific competences in mathematics and reading over time. Robust polynomial regressions combined with specification curve analyses showed that longer gaming times predicted worse grades 2 years later. These results could be replicated after controlling for initial grades and reasoning abilities. In contrast, mathematical and reading competences were not affected by gaming times. Thus, playing computer and video games can result in a noticeably, albeit small, loss of educational returns, but it does not affect basic competences. © 2018 Canadian Psychological Association.","Competence; Computer game; Grade; Longitudinal; Video game",,,,,,,,,,"Gnambs, T.",,,"American Psychological Association Inc.",,,,,21604134,,,,"English","Psychol.

Studies investigating this phenomenon suggest that social media leads to a series of potentially positive and negative psychological outcomes, including social and appearance comparisons, and rumination. However, these studies may be specific to Western cultures and may not necessarily apply in Asian populations. Hence, the present study aims to investigate whether existing concepts of Asian social behaviors based on Asian cultural norms and Western studies can depict Asian psychological experiences on social media. We investigate the associations between Instagram use and risk of psychopathology among Singaporean Chinese. Data from 363 individuals were examined in relation to four hypotheses: (1) Instagram use is not associated with social comparisons. (2) Social comparisons do not mediate the relationship between Instagram use and rumination. (3) Instagram use is associated with appearance comparisons. (4) Appearance comparisons mediate the relationship between Instagram use and risk of developing eating disorders. Three out of four hypotheses were supported. The present study contributes to the development of useful etiological models that are culturally relevant to Singaporean Chinese. Implications of the findings are discussed so as to direct future intervention efforts. © 2018 Canadian Psychological Association.","Chinese; Eating disorders; Instagram; Rumination; Social media",,,,,,,,,,"Teo, N.S.Y.",,,"American Psychological Association Inc.",,,,,21604134,,,,"English","Psychol.

Using film trailers with prominent Dark Triad characters, the current research examined perceptions of characters in movies and TV shows based on their Dark Triad characteristics and their gender. Undergraduate students (pilot study N = 21; present study N = 86) watched theatrical trailers originally released by the production companies before they rated 2 key characters' Dark Triad traits with the Dirty Dozen (Jonason & Webster, 2010). Analyses revealed significant interactions such that people reported less positive perceptions (e.g., less likable, relatable, appealing, and more troublesome) of female Dark Triad characters, as opposed to non-Dark Triad characters and male characters. Non-Dark Triad male characters were viewed as more troublesome than non-Dark Triad female characters, and female Dark Triad characters were viewed as the most troublesome. Possible extensions could explore the prevalence and popularity of Dark Triad-type characters in the media and how genders in media have changed over time. © 2018 Canadian Psychological Association.","Dark Triad; Gender; Machiavellianism; Narcissism; Psychopathy",,,,,,,,,,"Snyder, G.K.",,,"American Psychological Association Inc.",,,,,21604134,,,,"English","Psychol.

Whereas only half of 12th graders visited social media sites almost every day in 2008, 82% did by 2016. At the same time, iGen adolescents in the 2010s spent significantly less time on print media, TV, or movies compared with adolescents in previous decades. The percentage of 12th graders who read a book or a magazine every day declined from 60% in the late 1970s to 16% by 2016, and 8th graders spent almost an hour less time watching TV in 2016 compared with the early 1990s.

Similarly, the omnipresence of selfies on SNSs-a form of appearance-related exposure-raises concerns regarding psychological health. This study aimed to investigate the relationships between body image, self-objectification, self-esteem, and various selfie behaviors among young women (N = 179). We hypothesized that a worsened body image (i.e., higher body dissatisfaction or lower body appreciation), higher levels of self-objectification, and lower self-esteem would precede greater engagement in selfie behaviors. Structural equation modeling showed that body appreciation is associated with greater engagement in selfie selection and deliberate posting, and that self-objectification is related to greater engagement in all selfie behaviors assessed. In support of our proposed model, a reversed model was also tested that showed poorer results. These findings suggest that body image may serve not only as an outcome of SNS use but also as a motive preceding selfie behaviors. © 2018 American Psychological Association.","Body image; Online selfpresentation; Self-esteem; Self-objectification; Selfies",,,,,,,,,,"Veldhuis, J.",,,"American Psychological Association Inc.",,,,,21604134,,,,"English","Psychol.

Participants were randomly assigned to one of three conditions and viewed full-length popular motion pictures and completed a battery of measures related to idealistic beliefs and life satisfaction. Results of the 358 undergraduate participants indicated idealistic content led to stronger romantic beliefs and greater life satisfaction than did realistic content. In terms of beliefs, findings show the idealistic and control conditions resulted in an increase in romantic belief endorsement. Males and individuals in romantic relationships reported the strongest endorsement of beliefs and life satisfaction regardless of which film they viewed. In general, romantic comedies influence viewers positively, but only when the content is predominantly idealistic. Thus, the widely held belief that all romantic comedies, and only this genre, lead viewers to develop unrealistic relational expectations was not supported. However, results do extend social cognitive theory, in that positive portrayals of romance influenced viewers to report greater endorsement of beliefs and stronger life satisfaction. © 2018 American Psychological Association.","Experiment; Life satisfaction; Movies; Romantic beliefs; Social cognitive theory",,,,,,,,,,"Hefner, V.",,,"American Psychological Association Inc.",,,,,21604134,,,,"English","Psychol.

Participants (N = 418) were either exposed to nonpornographic control videos or pornographic videos in which a male taxi driver has sex with a female passenger. Participants' perceptions of the likelihood of women engaging in various sexual practices commonly depicted in pornography (e.g., unprotected sex with a stranger and rough sex) were then assessed across 2 vignettes. In the first vignette, a male taxi driver propositions a female passenger. In the second, a male boss propositions a female employee. The study was administered online to maximize ecological validity. No effect was found for experimental exposure. However, an effect was detected for past exposure. Men who had viewed taxi-themed pornography in the past 6 months rated the female taxi vignette character as being more likely to engage in porn-like sex with a male taxi driver. Similarly, those who had viewed workplace-themed pornography in the past 6 months judged the female workplace vignette character as being more likely to engage in porn-like sex with a male boss. The implications of these findings for theoretical models of sexual media socialization are discussed. © 2018 American Psychological Association.","Media effects; Men; Pornography; Sexually explicit media",,,,,,,,,,"Miller, D.J.",,,"American Psychological Association Inc.",,,,,21604134,,,,"English","Psychol.

Through the framework of objectification theory, we examined the relation of involvement on Facebook to women's internalization of appearance ideals, psychological well-being, and their intentions to make online purchases. Participants were 796 female college students who completed online measures regarding internalization, sources of beauty information, social comparisons, body satisfaction, self-esteem, purchases referrals, and purchase intentions. Using structural equation modeling, we found that passive Facebook usage influenced the women's internalization of societal beauty ideals, which was related inversely to the women's satisfaction with their bodies and self-esteem. Active Facebook usage had direct effects on attention to friends' referrals and purchase behaviors. Purchase intentions also were influenced by referrals, the importance they placed on social media outlets as sources of information about fashion and appearance, and a more positive self-image. Findings suggest that women's intentions to make online purchases are determined through their involvement in social media, their friendship connections, and the extent to which their self-perceptions have been affected by sociocultural processes. © 2016 American Psychological Association.","Body satisfaction; Facebook; Internalization; Purchase intention; Self-esteem",,,,,,,,,"Abrahamson, K., (2014) New consumer study: Millennials are 2X as likely to purchase products they share about, , http://www.sharethis.com/blog/2014/09/23/new-consumerstudy-millennials-2x-likely-purchase-products-share/#sthash.Qwhhg7Yi.dpbs, Share This; Anderson, M., Sims, J., Price, J., Brusa, J., (2011) Turning 'like' to 'buy' social media emerges as a commerce channel, , http://www.booz.com/media/uploads/BaCTurning_Like_to_Buy.pdf, Booz & Company; Andrews, B., Bodily shame as a mediator between abusive experiences and depression (1995) Journal of Abnormal Psychology, 104, pp. 277-285. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/0021-843X.104.2.277; Andsager, J.L., Research directions in social media and body image (2014) Sex Roles, 71 (11-12), pp. 407-413; Bandura, A., (1986) Social foundations of thought and action: A social cognitive theory, , Upper Saddle River, NJ: Prentice Hall, Inc; Banister, E.N., Hogg, M.K., Negative symbolic consumption and consumers' drive for self-esteem: The case of the fashion industry (2004) European Journal of Marketing, 38, pp. 850-868. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/03090560410539285; Barton, C., Koslow, L., Beauchamp, C., (2013) How millennials are changing the face of marketing forever, , https://www.bcgperspectives.com/content/articles/marketing_center_consumer_customer_insight_how_millennials_changing_marketing_forever/?chap=5#chapter5, bcg.perspectives; Bessenoff, G.R., Can the media affect us?.

SMs anonymously completed a survey about FB use during their current deployment. Data were collected on FB network size, time spent on FB, FB use integration and emotional connection (via the Social Media Use and Integration Scale), maladaptive FB use (via the Maladaptive Facebook Use Scale), and perceived social support (via the Social Provisions Scale). The majority of SMs had FB accounts (81%, n = 135), which they used during deployment. FB use integration and emotional connection was positively associated with perceived social support, whereas maladaptive FB use and time spent on FB were negatively associated with perceived social support. Non-FB users were more highly educated, higher in rank, and older compared to FB users. FB integration into users' social routines and users' emotional connection to FB may help increase positive perceptions of social support among deployed SMs. Education on the constructive use of FB during deployment may be useful in enhancing perceived social support and reducing maladaptive FB use. © 2016 American Psychological Association.","Deployment; Facebook; Perceived social support; Social media",,,,,,,"We thank the Joint Combat Casualty Research Team and Lieutenant Colonel Sandra Escolas, Director, United States Army Medical Research Directorate-West, for their support and contribution to the success of this project.",,"Armistead-Jehle, P., Johnston, S., Wade, N., Ecklund, C., Posttraumatic stress in U.S marines: The role of unit cohesion and combat exposure (2011) Journal of Counseling and Development, 89, pp. 81-88. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/j.1556-6678.2011.tb00063.x; Asbury, T., Hall, S., Facebook as a mechanism for social support and mental health wellness (2013) Psy Chi Journal of Psychological Research, 18, pp. 124-129; Barrett, C.C., Post-traumatic stress disorder, a novel hypothesis: Social networking and electronic isolation in the warzone (2012) Ethical Human Psychology and Psychiatry: An International Journal of Critical Inquiry, 14, pp. 199-201. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1891/1559-4343.14.3.199; Besser, A., Weinberg, M., Zeigler-Hill, V., Neria, Y., Acute symptoms of posttraumatic stress and dissociative experiences among female Israeli civilians exposed to war: The roles of intrapersonal and interpersonal sources of resilience (2014) Journal of Clinical Psychology, 70, pp. 1227-1239. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jclp.22083; Blease, C.R., Too many 'friends', too few 'likes'?.

The current study examines correlational relationships between violent game exposure and bullying behaviors, antisocial attitudes, civic attitudes, and civic behaviors in a sample of 304 children from the United Kingdom (Mean age = 12.81). The paper also considered motivational influences on use of violent digital games. Results indicated that violent game exposure did not correlate meaningfully with either antisocial or civic behaviors or attitudes.

In the present study, fans across a variety of fan groups rated their sense of community for their fan group and local community. The results largely support the prior findings, with fans rating the dimensions of sense of community higher for their fan group than for their local community. However, sport, music, and media fans rated their perceived influence on their fan group significantly lower than their influence on their local community and music fans showed no differences on belongingness.

Chinese gay virtual communities first emerged on scattered Websites (e.g., blogs and chat rooms) but now lie on Facebook, which provides a place to post a profile (e.g., photo and basic information), a personal display space (e.g., pictures), and an array of interactive methods (e.g., ""likes"" and comments). Further, cultural beliefs affect the development of the community. Confucianism and collectivism have most contributions on the homophobia within Chinese societies and the nondiverse value systems within the Chinese gay Facebook community. Based on the theoretical framework of social learning theory, this study explored gay users' reinforcing behaviors on Facebook. The 15 gay male participants included 12 Taiwanese, 2 Hong Kong residents, and 1 Mainland Chinese who had used Facebook on average 4.2 years. All attended semistructured interviews 40 - 60 min in length for phenomenological analysis. The results revealed 4 themes: (a) Participants created different accounts to separate gay and nongay friends; (b) Participants used ""gaydar"" to connect with new gay friends; (c) Self-promotion increased their friends and followers; and (d) The more ""likes"" they received, the more benefits they obtained. The results offer a new lens for rethinking the population's interaction and various needs, although they cannot fully apply it for Mainland Chinese and Chinese American gay male users. © 2016 American Psychological Association.","Chinese gay males; Facebook; Social learning theory; Virtual community",,,,,,,,,"Bandura, A., Social-learning theory of identificatory processes (1969) Handbook of socialization theory and research, pp. 213-262. , In D.

Specifically, with firearms frequently featured in videogames, including games where players are required to use firearms to succeed during gameplay, it is worth examining whether players' experience with firearms relates to their attitudes toward guns and gun policy. Utilizing the General Learning Model, this survey explores whether public policy outcomes regarding gun control and public safety are related to exposure to violent video games, first-person shooter games, and realistic gun controllers. Results show that increased exposure to first-person shooter games was related to more negative attitudes concerning gun control. In addition, more experience using realistic gun controllers was associated with negative attitudes toward gun control and greater support for the idea that greater gun availability can help guarantee public safety. Thus, video game exposure may shape the gun attitudes of young people in small but important ways. © 2016 American Psychological Association.","General Learning Model; Gun control; Policy attitudes; Video games",,,,,,,,,"(2015) American Psychological Association task force on violent media, , http://www.apa.org, Tech.

However, previous research indicates that spoilers can actually increase enjoyment. The present study tests mental model resonance as a mechanism for how spoilers influence enjoyment of media content in a real-world context, using a 2-part survey administered before and after the finale of a long-running TV series. Fan theories about content are also offered as a related, but separate issue from spoiler exposure. Parasocial breakup distress is tested as a previously unexamined outcome of spoiler and fan theory exposure. Results suggest that exposure to spoilers and belief in fan theories increase enjoyment and decrease parasocial breakup distress after a TV series finale, and this is mediated by mental model resonance. © 2016 American Psychological Association.","Enjoyment; Mental models; Narrative; Parasocial breakups; Spoilers",,,,,,,,,"Albrecht, S., Carbon, C.C., The Fluency Amplification Model: Fluent stimuli show more intense but not evidently more positive evaluations (2014) Acta Psychologica, 148, pp. 195-203. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.actpsy.2014.02.002; Ausiello, M., (2014) HIMYM boss breaks silence on divisive finale, , http://tvline.com/2014/04/01/himymfinale-mother-dies-ted-robin-marry/, April 1 Retrieved April 17, 2014; Bowman, N., Weber, R., Tamborini, R., Sherry, J., Facilitating game play: How others affect performance and enjoyment of video games (2013) Media Psychology, 16, pp. 39-64. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15213269.2012.742360; Brookes, S., Cohen, J., Ewoldsen, D.R., Velez, J., (2012) Don't talk about her like that: The effect of character information valence on identification and enjoyment, , (May) Paper presented at the annual meeting of the International Communication Association, Phoenix, AZ; Busselle, R., Bilandzic, H., Fictionality and perceived realism in experiencing stories: A model of narrative comprehension and engagement (2008) Communication Theory, 18, pp. 255-280. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1468-2885.2008.00322.x; Carter, B., (2014) 'How I Met Your Mother' gets its best ratings for finale, , http://www.nytimes.com, April 1 New York Times.

With the ability to connect to others across numerous modalities and occupy one's time, these devices have become personal extensions for many people. However, recent research suggests that young people are particularly likely to find these devices indispensable, even to the point of feeling that they cannot live without them. The current study tests whether smartphone use and smartphone dependency affects the health of romantic relationships among college-aged adults. Participants were asked to report on their own smartphone use and dependency as well as the perceived use and dependency of their partner. Results reveal that participants' smartphone dependency is significantly linked to relationship uncertainty, while partners' perceived smartphone dependency predicts less relationship satisfaction. Moreover, results suggest that smartphone use, in general, does not affect relational health. Thus, it appears that it is the psychological reliance on these devices, and one's need to constantly be connected with his or her smartphone, that potentially affects relationships and not actual use. © 2016 American Psychological Association.","Media dependency; Relationship certainty; Relationship satisfaction; Romantic relationships; Smartphones",,,,,,,,,"Ahlstrom, M., Lundberg, N.R., Zabriskie, R., Eggett, D., Lindsay, G.B., Me, my spouse, and my avatar: The relationship between marital satisfaction and playing massively multiplayer online role-playing games (MMORPGs) (2012) Journal of Leisure Research, 44, p. 1; Alabi, O.F., A survey of Facebook addiction level among selected Nigerian University undergraduates (2013) New Media and Mass Communication, 10, pp. 70-80; Baron, N., (2011) Concerns about mobile phones: A cross-national study, , http://dx.doi.org/10.5210/fm.v16i8.3335, First Monday.

Although their title implies they can be intuitively defined as having the primary intention of changing or reinforcing players' attitudes on certain topics, only a handful of studies have provided evidence that these games actually influence attitudes. After presenting a summary of previous studies' results, the current article expands on this evidence by reporting on a controlled online experiment that compared a currently playable persuasive game (My Cotton Picking Life) with a mobilizing YouTube clip covering the same topic. The study included a pre- and posttest and 2 media conditions. Two hundred thirty-seven individuals (mean age of 23) from an international population participated in this study. Because the persuasive game and comparable movie clip were concerned with forced labor in Uzbekistani cotton fields, attitude scales on empowerment, the workload of cotton picking, and denial of the issue, were composed for this study and subsequently validated. Results showed a greater increase on workload attitudes for individuals who played the game than for those who watched the clip. Enjoyment of the game as well as awareness of the game's intent also increased the attitude change from pre- to posttest. The paper offers insight into how persuasive games can be further validated with different methods, and concludes that there is mounting evidence for the viability of games as a medium for persuasive communication. © 2016 American Psychological Association.","Attitudes; Effects; Impact; persuasive games; Serious games",,,,,,,,,"All, A., Nuñez Castellar, E.P., Van Looy, J., Assessing the effectiveness of digital game-based learning: Best practices (2016) Computers and Education, 92-93, pp. 90-103. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.compedu.2015.10.007; Bogost, I., (2007) Persuasive games, , Cambridge, MA: The MIT Press; De la Hera, T., A theoretical model for the study of persuasive communication through digital games (2015) Engaging consumers through branded entertainment and convergent media, pp. 74-88. , In J.

While selfies have been observed in relation to narcissism and self-promoting behaviors, little is know about their technology usage and its implications. The present research adopted a uses and gratifications approach and utilized an online survey of Millennials (N = 205) to extract selfie-takers' activities, as well as their connections to positive effects, such as digital literacy and self-enhancement. Participants uploaded their ""best"" selfie to the survey and answered a series of questions about their selfie-related attitudes and behaviors. Participants' best selfies were content analyzed to examine features of these photos, and the relationships between selfie practices, motivations, and digital literacy engagement were examined. Results indicated that selfies are considered as meaningful content, as selfie-takers were mostly motivated to produce selfies to capture memorable moments. Selfies were also created using both nondigital and digital techniques, which can exhibit selfie-takers' digital literacy skills and confidence in using technology. Lastly, selfie-takers were motivated to engage in further media production. Implications of the findings are discussed in terms of selfies' educational value. © 2016 American Psychological Association.","Digital literacy; Digital technologies; Self-concept; Selfies; Uses and gratification theory",,,,,,,,,"Addley, E., (2014) Ellen's Oscars selfie most retweeted ever-And more of us are taking them, , http://www.theguardian.com/media/2014/mar/07/oscarsselfie-most-retweeted-ever, (March 7).

A solution containing 6 factors for texting behaviors was supported, which were named social connection, escapist, distracted, audacious, nurtured communication, and driving. The characteristics of these factors were explored using individual differences in personality and sensation-seeking behavior, where extraversion and disinhibition were consistent significant predictors for many types of texting. Additionally, a measure of depressive symptoms was predictive of some types of problematic texting. In general, our results support that texting is not a unidimensional social behavior, but a multidimensional behavior composed of social and nonsocial facets, including problematic behavior. The usefulness of this scale, particularly with respect to problematic texting behaviors, and future applications for empirical, survey, metaanalytic, and health research are discussed. © 2016 American Psychological Association.","Depression; Factor analysis; Individual differences; Personality; Texting",,,,,,,,,"Almasy, S., (2014) Dad's texting to daughter sparks argument, fatal shooting in movie theater CNN, , http://www.cnn.com/2014/01/13/justice/floridamovie-theater-shooting/, Retrieved February 13 2014; Atchley, P., Atwood, S., Boulton, A., The choice to text and drive in younger drivers: Behavior may shape attitude (2011) Accident Analysis and Prevention, 43, pp. 134-142. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aap.2010.08.003; Augner, C., Hacker, G.W., Associations between problematic mobile phone use and psychological parameters in young adults (2012) International Journal of Public Health, 57, pp. 437-441. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00038-011-0234-z; Bailey, S.K.T., Schroeder, B.L., Sims, V.K., Unsafe texting and socially problematic texting: Need for cognition as an underlying predictor (2015) Proceedings of the Human Factors and Ergonomics Society Annual Meeting, 59, pp. 971-975. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1541931215591279; Bailey, S.K.T., Schroeder, B.L., Whitmer, D.E., Sims, V.K., Perceptions of mobile instant messaging apps are comparable to texting for young adults in the United States (2016) Proceedings of the Human Factors and Ergonomics Society Annual Meeting, 60, pp. 1235-1239. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1541931213601288; Bayer, J.B., Campbell, S.W., Texting while driving on automatic: Considering the frequency-independent side of habit (2012) Computers in Human Behavior, 28, pp. 2083-2090. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chb.2012.06.012; Benotsch, E.G., Snipes, D.J., Martin, A.M., Bull, S.S., Sexting, substance use, and sexual risk behavior in young adults (2013) The Journal of Adolescent Health, 52, pp. 307-313. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jadohealth.2012.06.011; Bianchi, A., Phillips, J.G., Psychological predictors of problem mobile phone use (2005) Cyberpsychology & Behavior, 8, pp. 39-51. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1089/cpb.2005.8.39; Bickham, D.S., Hswen, Y., Rich, M., Media use and depression: Exposure, household rules, and symptoms among young adolescents in the USA (2015) International Journal of Public Health, 60, pp. 147-155. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00038-014-0647-6; Boenker, M.L., (2011) Scared textless: The influence of sensation seeking tendencies and need for cognition on texting while driving fear appeals (Master's thesis), , http://hdl.handle.net/1969.1/ETD-TAMU-2011-08-9918, Retrieved August 5, 2015; Brown, B., Green, N., Harper, R., (2002) Wireless world: Social and interactional aspects of the mobile age, , http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4471-0665-4, London, New York, NY: Springer; Cacioppo, J.T., Petty, R.E., Feinstein, J.A., Jarvis, W.B.G., Dispositional differences in cognitive motivation: The life and times of individuals varying in need for cognition (1996) Psychological Bulletin, 119, pp. 197-253. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/0033-2909.119.2.197; Campbell, S.W., Russo, T.C., The social construction of mobile telephony: An application of the social influence model to perceptions and uses of mobile phones within personal communications networks (2003) Communication Monographs, 70, pp. 317-334. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/036377.5032000179124; Church, K., de Oliveira, R., What's up with WhatsApp?.

The present study examines how transgender individuals use both traditional and emerging media to better understand their own gender identities and their social worlds. A constructivist approach to the uses and gratifications perspective motivated interview questions about the role of media in the lives of transgender individuals. Forty-one transgender individuals participated in semistructured interviews. Results suggested media were instrumental for sensemaking. Participants used media to make sense of feelings, sexual relations, community, and transition options. Participants also used media to meet nonmediated goals or to initiate interpersonal negotiations. The potential impact of media on transgender audiences and the limitations of the uses and gratifications perspective are discussed in light of the findings. © 2016 American Psychological Association.","Identity; Media; Sensemaking; Transgender; Uses and gratifications",,,,,,,,,"(2013) Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders, , (5th ed.)

In the present manuscript, the authors review the literature published to date on the topic and outline 2 potential models to explain the pattern of findings. Data from 62 samples of published and unpublished research (N = 13,430) are meta-analyzed with respect to the relationships between grandiose and vulnerable narcissism and (a) time spent on social media, (b) frequency of status updates/tweets on social media, (c) number of friends/followers on social media, and (d) frequency of posting pictures of self or selfies on social media. Findings suggest that grandiose narcissism is positively related to all 4 indices (rs = .11-.20), although culture and social media platform significantly moderated the results. Vulnerable narcissism was not significantly related to social media use (rs = .05-.42), although smaller samples make these effects less certain. Limitations of the current literature and recommendations for future research are discussed. © 2016 American Psychological Association.","Facebook; Meta-analysis; Narcissism; Selfies; Social media",,,,,,,,,"Ahn, H., Kwolek, E., Bowman, N.D., Two faces of narcissism on SNS: The distinct effects of vulnerable and grandiose narcissism on SNS privacy control (2015) Computers in Human Behavior, 45, pp. 375-381. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chb.2014.12.032; Alhabash, S., Park, H., Kononova, A., Chiang, Y.H., Wise, K., Exploring the motivations of Facebook use in Taiwan (2012) Cyberpsychology, Behavior, and Social Networking, 15, pp. 304-311. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1089/cyber.2011.0611; Alloway, T., Runac, R., Qureshi, M., Kemp, G., Is Facebook linked to selfishness?.

Collectively, the literature on media influence, cultivation hypothesis, social learning, and imitation lend credibility to the hypothesis that exposure to crime-related media content will result in increased desire for weapon ownership. The specific research question examined in this study is as follows: What is the relationship of wanting a weapon (either a gun or a knife) following exposure to media content? Derived from the extant literature, a plausible source of weapon desire is explored based on face-toface interviews (603 respondents) in an adult population. Social media usage, direct and indirect victimization, and being under 40 years of age were the direct predictors of weapon desirability. Being under 40, gender (being male), crime concerns, social media, and knowledge of other crime victims (indirect victimization) had higher total effects.

Through an experiment, the present study showed fictional descriptions of video games with names and gender pronouns manipulated to feature male, female, or sex-neutral protagonists to 379 male and female players and nonplayers. Results indicate that players value protagonists with desirable and likable traits when they consider purchasing a game, whereas nonplayers focus on readily apparent physical similarities. Results also show that male and female players show little preference for the sex of the protagonist, whereas male nonplayers anticipate the most game enjoyment when the main character is a male. Thus, publishers should not turn away from games with a female protagonist and should work to promote a representative diversity among game characters. © 2018 American Psychological Association.","Identification; Protagonist; Purchase intention; Similarity; Video games",,,,,,,,,,"Hanus, M.D.",,,"American Psychological Association Inc.",,,,,21604134,,,,"English","Psychol.

After spending 18 years in prison for a wrongful conviction, Avery was arrested again and found guilty of the murder of Teresa Halbach. Due to the controversial nature of the case, and the popularity associated with the documentary, this event was used to evaluate several variables that may influence judgment on decisions of a defendant's guilt or innocence. Participants (N = 905) were recruited online via several social media platforms and included in the study if they acknowledged watching the documentary. They then completed an online survey containing questionnaires related to demographics (e.g., gender, ethnicity), perceptual (e.g., punitive attitudes), and psychosocial characteristics (e.g., posttraumatic stress symptom severity). The majority of participants rated both Avery and his nephew, Brendan Dassey, also convicted in association for the crime, as innocent. Female participants reported higher ratings of guilt than males. Lower ratings of guilt were associated with lower levels of socioeconomic status, greater religious involvement, higher posttraumatic stress symptoms, and greater negative attitudes toward the judicial system. Race and political beliefs were unrelated to ratings of guilt. These results support previous research suggesting psychological and demographic variables may influence jurors' judgments of guilt in murder trials. Implications concerning maintaining impartiality among jury peers and preventing implicit biases are discussed. © 2018 American Psychological Association.","Guilt; Jury bias; Murder trial; Posttraumatic stress; Steven Avery",,,,,,,,,,"Rodriguez, L.",,,"American Psychological Association Inc.",,,,,21604134,,,,"English","Psychol.

By randomly assigning college students to listen to or watch Lady Gaga's ""Til It Happens To You""-a socially conscious music video released in 2015 that deals with college campus sexual assaults-we found videos to be superior to songs in both boosting narrative engagement (via an increased comprehension of the song as evidence by open-ended explanations of the song's narrative) and (via a serial causal model test) lowering rape myth acceptance.

The present research tests the hypothesis that people with greater anxiety and who use video games as a means of coping with that anxiety are more prone to video game addiction. The hypothesis was tested in 2 survey studies using undergraduate samples. Study 1 found that using video games as a means of coping with setbacks or stress uniquely predicted video game addiction symptoms, even after controlling for frequency of gameplay and other maladaptive coping mechanisms. Serial mediation analysis provided evidence that anxiety associated with mental illness may prompt greater use of video games as a coping mechanism, something which, in turn, is associated with greater video game addiction. Study 2 replicated this serial mediation model. Although limited in their ability to infer causal direction, the studies do suggest the importance of assessing the role of player motivation in future studies about video game addiction, which may help clinicians and media researchers better understand the etiology and potential treatment of video game addiction. © 2018 American Psychological Association.","Addiction; Anxiety; Coping; Mental illness; Video game",,,,,,,,,,"Plante, C.N.",,,"American Psychological Association Inc.",,,,,21604134,,,,"English","Psychol.

This study aimed to address the link between Instagram use and a range of psychological variables in two parts. Participants were 129 women aged between 18 and 35 years. In Part 1, women completed a series of questionnaires related to mental health outcomes and self-perceptions. Results showed that the frequency of Instagram use is correlated with depressive symptoms, self-esteem, general and physical appearance anxiety, and body dissatisfaction and that the relationship between Instagram use and each of these variables is mediated by social comparison orientation. In Part 2, participants were exposed to a range of either beauty, fitness, or travel Instagram images (or a control condition with no images). Beauty and fitness images significantly decreased self-rated attractiveness, and the magnitude of this decrease correlated with anxiety, depressive symptoms, self-esteem, and body dissatisfaction. Therefore, excessive Instagram use may contribute to negative psychological outcomes and poor appearance-related self-perception, in line with prior research.

However, little attention has been given to popular music within this context (DeWall, Pond, Campbell, & Twenge, 2011). The current study examines changes in self-promotion (e.g., references to self, bragging, demands for respect), and the sociodemographic characteristics of both artists and audiences as they relate to self-promoting tendencies in popular music. Data were obtained using Billboard Hot 100 songs for the years 1990, 2000, and 2010. The most popular music in 2010 contained significantly more types of self-promotion than music from previous decades. This change reflects characteristics of genres (e.g., rap/hip-hop, pop, dance) that have gained popularity among younger audiences, but also corresponds to larger societal changes in individualism. Songs by male artists and African American artists were more likely to contain self-promotion than those by female or Caucasian artists. These differences are considered within the context of past theory and research related to socialization across groups more generally.

However, the underlying cognitive and emotional mechanisms behind how and when suicide contagion occurs have been, up to this point, hazily understood. The present study: (a) tested whether individuals with depressed affect respond differently to celebrity suicides widely publicized by the media compared with those who do not have depressed affect, (b) measured 2 potential cognitive mechanisms that may be involved in suicide contagion, death-thought accessibility and attitudes about the acceptability and normality of suicide, and (c) compared responses to widely publicized suicide versus accidental death and natural death. The findings highlight a key moderator-depressive affect-that predicts the likelihood of being susceptible to suicide contagion effects following media coverage of a suicide death, clarify that its boundary conditions include cases of accidental death, and elucidate 2 cognitive mechanisms, death-thought accessibility and attitudes toward suicide acceptability and normality. © 2016 American Psychological Association.","Depressed affect; Media coverage; Social contagion; Suicide",,,,,,,,,"Bachman, S.S., McGuire, T.G., Pomeranz, D., Tompkins, C.P., Porell, F.W., Wallack, S.S., Preferred provider organizations: Options for Medicare (1989) Inquiry, 26, pp. 24-34; Bandura, A., (1986) Social foundations of thought and action: A social cognitive theory, , New York, NY: Prentice Hall, Inc; Bandura, A., Social cognitive theory: An agentic perspective (2001) Annual Review of Psychology, 52, pp. 1-26. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1146/annurev.psych.52.1.1; Bandura, A., Social cognitive theory of mass communication (2002) Media Effects: Advances in Theory and Research, 2, pp. 121-153; Berinsky, A.J., Huber, G.A., Lenz, G.S., Evaluating online labor markets for experimental research: Amazon.com's Mechanical Turk (2012) Politi- cal Analysis, 20, pp. 351-368. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/pan/mpr057; Buhrmester, M., Kwang, T., Gosling, S.D., Amazon's mechanical turk: A new source of inexpensive, yet high-quality, data?

Moreover, given that self-objectification reflects the internalization of gender-based inequalities, we also tested whether self-objectification was associated with greater tolerance toward sexual harassment of women. Two hundred and ten undergraduate students (112 men) were asked to watch sexually objectifying (vs. neutral) video clips before completing a questionnaire assessing tolerance toward sexual harassment. As expected, we found that watching sexually objectifying video clips led to more victim blame when evaluating a real-life scenario of sexual harassment, but it did not affect general attitudes toward sexual harassment. Moreover, trait self-objectification was associated with general attitudes toward sexual harassment of women, with more tolerance toward sexual harassment among people with high trait self-objectification. In contrast, neither exposure to sexually objectifying video clips nor trait selfobjectification affected perpetrator blame. These findings suggest that even short exposure to sexually objectifying media contributes to shifting attitudes toward sexual harassment of nonsexualized women in the real world, and they also illuminate the role of self-objectification in maintaining gender-based inequalities. © 2016 American Psychological Association.","Perpetrator blame; Self-objectification; Sexual harassment; Sexual objectification; Victim blame",,,,,,,"This research was supported by the National Fund for Scientific Research (FRS-FNRS, Belgium) and by the Fonds d’Encouragement à la Recherche (Université Libre de Bruxelles, Belgium).",,"Aiken, L.S., West, S.G., (1991) Multiple regression: Testing and interpreting interactions, , London, UK: Sage; (2011) Lollipop (Param Pam Pam) [Youtube video], , https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDAbsj72aI, February 9 Retrieved from; (2011) Bittersweet (LIVE) - dedicat lui Alex [Youtube video], , https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQ09WcwwkVk, September 17.

Recently eudaimonic, or truth-seeking, motivations have also received attention. Most investigations into hedonic and eudaimonic motivations for media consumption have conceptualized these motivations as traits, rather than as states, using surveys to determine that long-standing hedonic and eudaimonic motivations influence entertainment preferences. This experiment explored the possibility that more temporary hedonic and eudaimonic states can also be induced by media exposure. A laboratory experiment successfully manipulated hedonic and eudaimonic states using clips with either hedonic or eudaimonic tone from 3 different TV programs, with clip tone affecting participants' reports of hedonic and eudaimonic states as well as meaningful and fun affect. The experiment also found partial evidence that clip tone might influence subsequent program selection, but only with 1 program of 3 in the study. Implications for an understanding of TV consumption motivations are discussed. © 2016 American Psychological Association.","Enjoyment; Entertainment; Eudaimonia; Media; Selective exposure",,,,,,,,,"Algoe, S.B., Haidt, J., Witnessing excellence in action: The 'other-praising' emotions of elevation, gratitude, and admiration (2009) The Journal of Positive Psychology, 4, pp. 105-127. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/17439760802650519; Anderson, K., Anderson, C., Dill, K., Deuser, W., The interactive relations between trait hostility, pain, and aggressive thoughts (1998) Aggressive Behavior, 24, pp. 161-171. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/(SICI)1098-2337(1998)24:3161::AID-AB13.0.CO;2-O; Baas, M., De Dreu, C.K.W., Nijstad, B.A., A meta-analysis of 25 years of moodcreativity research: Hedonic tone, activation, or regulatory focus?

We investigate whether being out of the loopon a specific domain of information-pop culture-will lead to negative outcomes associated with more complete forms of ostracism. Participants reported lower need satisfaction and being more out of the loop after viewing unfamiliar, compared to familiar, musicians (Study 1) and celebrities (Study 2). Study 3 assessed a different form of pop culture stimuli- brand logos-and found the same results. Finally, Study 4 utilized an alternative method where participants were exposed to a variety of pop culture stimuli (e.g., movies, books, singers) and also included a non-pop culturerelated control condition. Participants in the unfamiliar condition reported lower need satisfaction and feeling more out of the loop than participants in the familiar and control conditions. Across all 4 studies, feeling more out of the loop mediated the relationship between familiarity and need satisfaction level. Additionally, participants' self-rated pop culture importance did not moderate the effect. Thus, seemingly innocuous reminders of being out of the cultural loop in everyday life are capable of eliciting negative psychological consequences. © 2016 American Psychological Association.","Exclusion; Ostracism; Out of the loop; Pop culture",,,,,,,,,"Baumeister, R.F., Leary, M.R., The need to belong: Desire for interpersonal attachments as a fundamental human motivation (1995) Psychological Bulletin, 117, pp. 497-529. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/0033-2909.117.3.497; Derrick, J.L., Gabriel, S., Hugenberg, K., Social surrogacy: How favored television programs provide the experience of belonging (2009) Journal of Experimental Social Psychology, 45, pp. 352-362. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jesp.2008.12.003; Durkheim, E., (1897) Suicide: A study in sociology, , New York, NY: Free Press; Faulkner, S., After the whistle is blown: The aversive impact of ostracism (1999) Dissertation Abstracts International: Section B: The Sciences and Engineering, 59, p. 3770; Gardner, W.L., Pickett, C.L., Knowles, M.L., Social ""snacking"" and social ""shielding"": The satisfaction of belonging needs through the use of social symbols and the social self (2005) The social outcast: Ostracism, social exclusion, rejection, and bullying, , In K.

Despite its prevalence, public perception about mental illness remains obscured by misinformation and social stigma. Scholars have long recognized the role that mass media play in cultivating and perpetuating this stigma. The purpose of this study was to survey college students (N = 359) to explore how mass media prime stereotypic conceptions about mental illness and subsequently influence the mechanisms of social stigma. Results indicated that media use predicted higher estimates of the prevalence of mental illness. Participants' descriptions of mentally ill media characters were characterized by stereotypic attributes including violent behaviors, angry outbursts, childlike behaviors, and severe symptomatology. Recall of stereotypic depictions of mental illness predicted discomfort around people with mental illness, but those participants who defined mental illness using severe symptomatology were more willing to communicate concerns about mental illness. These findings illuminate why it is necessary to assess how audiences perceive media representations of mental illness in order to understand the mechanisms through which mass media shape public perception about mental illness. © 2016 American Psychological Association.","Cultivation; Media priming; Mental illness; Stereotypes; Stigma",,,,,,,,,"(2006) National college health assessment reference group: Executive summary, , Fall.

This model posits that early cyberbullying behaviors aid in the development of anonymity perceptions and the belief that one's muscularity is irrelevant online (termed BI-MOB). These variables lead to the development of positive cyberbullying attitudes, which predict subsequent cyberbullying perpetration. Finally, continued cyberbullying perpetration further reinforces anonymity perceptions and BI-MOB. The current study expanded the BGCM by examining these cyclical learning postulates. Participants (N = 172; 80% female; average age = 19.79 years) completed measures of anonymity perceptions, cyberbullying attitudes, cyberbullying perpetration, and BI-MOB four times throughout the academic semester. Results from our longitudinal path model showed that Wave 1 BI-MOB and anonymity predicted Wave 2 cyberbullying attitudes, which predicted Wave 3 cyberbullying (i.e., strong support for the BGCM). Additionally, Wave 3 cyberbullying predicted Wave 4 anonymity and BI-MOB-confirming the learning postulates of BGCM that have yet to be tested. © 2018 American Psychological Association.","Anonymity; Cyberbullying; Cyberbullying attitudes",,,,,,,,,,"Barlett, C.P.",,,"American Psychological Association Inc.",,,,,21604134,,,,"English","Psychol.

Our analysis paid attention to the gender and race of the musical artist in each video, as well as the video's music genre. Regression analyses revealed that depicted sexuality and sexual objectification did not change during the period studied. However, ambiguous sexual expression, including sexual gestures, sexual poses, and sexual facial expressions, did increase over time. Furthermore, female music artists were more often portrayed as sexually objectified than male artists. Male artists were more likely shown to objectify other individuals compared with female artists.

The results showed that exposure to illustrations increased imagery fluency, leading to narrative engagement and ultimately less counterarguing against a sympathetic, positive portrayal of schizophrenia. The effect of exposure to the illustration on story-consistent belief through imagery fluency was the most substantial indirect effect in the model.

Advances in gaming technology have encouraged the development of natural user interfaces (NUIs), which should provide a superior user experience as players are able to use preexisting mental models from physical interaction rather than learning an abstract mapping schema. However, anecdotal and previous empirical research suggest the opposite-gamers prefer more familiaralbeit- abstract gamepad controllers. Because the exact nature and mechanism of this preference remains open for investigation, we suggest two rivaling mechanisms related to novelty and learning. Comparing self-identified gamer regarding their last gamepad and NUIs experience in an online quasi-experimental survey design (N = 248), participants in the current study had less experience using NUIs, resulting in lower self-efficacy and enjoyment. Learning effects (via experience with a controller), rather than novelty effects (via exposure to a unique controller), seem to be the most relevant mechanism to understanding how controllers impact game enjoyment. However, both controller novelty and learning effects were significant mediators of the link between controller type and perceived controller naturalness. Our data suggest that perceptions of ""natural"" do not only depend on technological features of a user interface, but also on the user's previous experiences with the device. As such, users need to build robust mental models of the controllers through experience, which over time become more natural with increasing proficiency. © 2018 American Psychological Association.","Game controllers; Learning; Natural mapping; Novelty; Video games",,,,,,,,,,"Liebold, B.",,,"American Psychological Association Inc.",,,,,21604134,,,,"English","Psychol.

Previous work has predominantly used attitude scales and ignored other measures. Factors such as the role of the opponent in games and what may be the mechanism behind any effects have likewise received little attention.

Following play, intergroup anxiety was reported, and participants wrote a short passage of prose regarding the outgroup and rated on attitude scales. Analysis demonstrated that playing with outgroup members was indeed an effective method of increasing the positivity toward outgroup members, reflected in both scale and prose measures.

To this end, a mixed-methods approach was used to investigate prerequisites of nostalgic video game experiences, their nature, and connections to well-being. In a randomized online survey, participants were instructed to elaborate on past (vs. recent) and social (vs. solo) gaming memories. Quantitative analyses indicated that nostalgia was impacted (a) directly by past memories and intrinsic need satisfaction of competence and relatedness within the remembrance, and (b) indirectly by social memories that increased relatedness. Controlling for the associations between need satisfaction and well-being, nostalgia showed significant associations with present feelings of connectedness. Additional qualitative analyses indicated that past memories were more strongly associated with enjoyment and challenge, and social memories were likely to involve close others.

College women (N = 339; Mage = 18.35) self-reported their frequency of ASMC experiences. They also reported their overall time spent on social media, as well as their levels of self-objectification (i.e., body surveillance), body comparison, body esteem, and depressive symptoms. Women endorsed high rates of ASMC; for example, roughly three-quarters reported frequent ASMC experiences. In addition, results of 2 path analyses indicated that higher ASMC was significantly associated with (a) higher body surveillance, higher body comparison, and lower body esteem, controlling for time spent on social media; and (b) higher levels of depressive symptoms, controlling for body surveillance and time spent on social media. The results of this preliminary investigation indicate that ASMC may reflect a common set of experiences among young women and that higher levels may be maladaptive for psychological adjustment.

Violence is one emotionally arousing cue that attracts attention away from less arousing cues located in the same visual environment. Previous research has shown that violent media content attracts attention at the expense of brands advertised during violent media content. We predicted that participants who played a video game violently would recall and recognize fewer brands than participants who played the same game nonviolently. In Study 1, participants (N = 154) drove cars in the game The Getaway while real brands appeared within the city. Half of the participants played the game violently (running over characters) and half of the participants played the game nonviolently (carefully avoiding characters). Violent players recalled and recognized fewer brands than did nonviolent players. In Study 2, participants (N = 102) drove cars in the game Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas while fictitious brands were advertised on their vehicles. Half of the participants played the game violently (running over characters) and half of the participants played the game nonviolently (carefully avoiding characters). Violent players were less likely to recognize advertised brands than were nonviolent players. Not enough participants recalled brands to test whether violent players recalled fewer brands than did nonviolent players. These results across both studies suggest that within-game violence reduces the effectiveness of product placement, such that brands advertised in violent video games are less likely to be remembered than brands advertised in nonviolent video games. © 2016 American Psychological Association.","brand memory; product placement; video game advertising; violent video games",,,,,,,,,"http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/2621519.stm, BBC News.

To begin to fill that gap, we analyzed fan fiction about the TV show Mad Men to investigate how fans use fan fiction to make meaning from the source text. A sample of fan fiction stories was coded for the presence of eudaimonic and hedonic story components, the emotions expressed in the stories, the perspectives adopted by the fan writers, and plots that function as wish fulfillment. Findings indicated that fan fiction writers' motivations were more eudaimonic than hedonic, the stories often contained mixed or negative emotional content, the writers frequently took the perspective of a female character in their stories, and in some cases the stories enabled characters to achieve positive resolutions denied them by the source text. Taken together, the results point to the many ways in which fans engage with and make sense of a popular TV show. Future psychological research on fan fiction of additional popular culture texts would be valuable for understanding the ways fans grapple with various elements of those texts. © 2016 American Psychological Association.","appreciation; enjoyment; eudaimonic and hedonic motivations; fan fiction; meaningfulness",,,,,,,,,"Adalian, J., Bernardin, M., Buchanan, K., Chianca, P., Dobbins, A., Fox, J.D., Vineyard, J., (2012) The 25 Most Devoted Fan Bases Mad Men, , http://www.vulture.com/2012/10/25-most-devoted-fans.html, October 15; Bartsch, A., Hartmann, T., The role of cognitive and affective challenge in entertainment experience (2015) Communication Research, , http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0093650214565921, Advance online publication; Bartsch, A., Kalch, A., Oliver, M.B., Moved to think: The role of emotional media experiences in stimulating reflective thoughts (2014) Journal of Media Psychology, 26, pp. 125-140. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1027/1864-1105/a000118; Bartsch, A., Oliver, M.B., Making sense of entertainment: On the interplay of emotion and cognition in entertainment experience (2011) Journal of Media Psychology, 23, pp. 12-17. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1027/1864-1105/a000026; Busse, K., Hellekson, K., Introduction: Work in progress (2006) Fan Fiction and Fan Communities in the Age of the Internet: New Essays, pp. 5-32. , K.

Both male and female actors scored significantly higher than nonactors on Antisocial, Narcissism, Histrionic, Borderline, and Obsessive-Compulsive personality disorder scales of the Coolidge Axis-II inventory (Coolidge, 2001). Male actors scored significantly higher than the male comparison group on Schizotypal, Avoidant, and Dependent personality disorder scales. Relationships between personality disorder traits in actors and their self-reported acting abilities, preferences, and success were examined. The results are discussed with reference to how heightened subclinical levels of personality disorders traits are potentially unhelpful to acting performance and managing the demands of the profession.

In particular, we examined transportation into the Twilight narrative and parasocial interaction with Twilight characters, and their correlations with gender beliefs, feminist identity, and relational satisfaction. Results revealed that Twilight Moms who held traditional beliefs about women and who identified as nonfeminist were more able to experience transportation into the books, and dissatisfaction with their current romantic partners predicted parasocial interaction with Twilight characters. We interpret these findings in light of fan studies research as well as media entertainment theory and research. © 2016 American Psychological Association.",,,,,,,,,,"Adams, A.G., Sizemore, B., Parasocial romance: A social exchange perspective (2013) Interpersona: An International Journal on Personal Relationships, 7, pp. 12-25. , http://dx.doi.org/10.5964/ijpr.v7i1.106; Ames, M., Twilight follows tradition: Analyzing 'biting' critiques of vampire narratives and their portrayals of gender and sexuality (2010) Bitten by Twilight: Youth Culture, Media, and the Vampire Franchise, pp. 37-54. , M.

Additionally, effect testing was used to replicate meta-analytic evidence that narcissism has increased over time. Participants reported their daily TV exposure, preferences for specific TV genres (e.g., drama, sports), and completed the NPI. Daily TV exposure was positively associated with narcissism. Preferences for reality TV, sports, suspense/thriller/horror shows, and political talk shows were positively associated with narcissism. Preference for news was negatively associated with narcissism. Effect testing revealed that narcissism in college students has continued to increase over time.

Because these features facilitate the recipient's interaction with a media persona, they can be assumed to influence the perceived parasocial interaction (PSI; Horton & Wohl, 1956). The goal of the present paper was to investigate the connection between cross-media extensions of a social TV series and the PSI with its protagonist. To this aim, a social TV series was used in which the viewer even had the possibility to add the fictitious protagonist as a Facebook friend, enabling the fictitious character to actively communicate with the audience. An online survey with 218 participants showed that, in particular, the Facebook friendship and thus the communication with a protagonist has an impact on the degree of PSI. © 2016 American Psychological Association.","Facebook; mobile device application; parasocial interaction; second screen; social TV",,,,,,,,,"Auter, P.J., Davis, D.M., When characters speak directly to viewers: Breaking the fourth wall in television (1991) The Journalism Quarterly, 68, pp. 165-171. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/107769909106800117; Ballantine, P.W., Martin, B.A., Forming parasocial relationships in online communities (2005) Advances in Consumer Research, 32, pp. 197-201. , G.

Compounded by myriad stressors of youth, the coming out process can yield a host of negative outcomes (suicide, depression, etc.) for questioning young people. This research utilized sense of community and collective identity frameworks (specifically, the attribute of symbols that is explicated in both literatures) to explore the affirmative role that gay icons can have in individual coming out processes. Retrospective, open-ended interviews were conducted with 10 ""out and proud"" gay men in the northeast region of the United States. Interviews were video-recorded, transcribed, and content-analyzed to identify themes. Three themes emerged from the data inductively. Sense of Self refers to the strongest link that participants perceived among all gay icons, Shared Identity refers to the connectedness that participants felt with the icons they mentioned, and Enabler of Coming Out refers to the belief among participants that they received validating messages about their emerging sexualities from the icons with whom they identified. Implications for policy, practice, and future research are also discussed.

Many researchers have cited potential consequences associated with a high frequency of texting and problematic texting behaviors. This study examines the relations among frequency of texting, a specific type of problematic texting (i.e., compulsive texting), and adolescents' academic achievement and attitudes about school. Adolescents in 8th (n = 211) and 11th (n = 192) grades participated in this study. Results indicated that, as hypothesized, teens' compulsive texting was significantly positively related to their frequency of texting and negatively related to their grades, school bonding, and perceived scholastic competence. It is noteworthy that the negative relation between compulsive texting and academic functioning held true only for females and not for males.

Box 6293, Morgantown, WV  26506, United States","Advances in realistic graphics and artificial intelligence are hallmarks of evolved video games, as environments and characters are made to seem more real. Little is known, however, about whether or not character model changes may impact players' relationships with familiar avatars, especially since anthropomorphism-the perception of nonhuman objects as being human or humanlike-is understood as central to player-avatar interaction (PAX). This study leveraged a naturally occurring change to massively multiplayer online game avatars to conduct a field quasiexperiment to investigate whether enhanced avatar anthropomorphism influences PAX dimensions: emotional investment, anthropomorphic autonomy, suspension of disbelief, and sense of control. Longitudinal analysis showed that enhanced anthropomorphism had no significant impact on any PAX dimension immediately or over time, when controlling for demographic and gameplay variables. Player comments suggest the change was experienced not as a change in humanness, but as a shift in perceptual realism-believability, lifelikeness, depth-that impacted the experience of the avatar-mediated gameworld more broadly.

The purpose of this study was to implement and evaluate a new Cyberwellness program, the iZ HERO Adventure, which is a hands-on digital exhibition involving peer-mentoring and a transmedia adventure storytelling mode within a multisystemic approach. A total of 440 Grades 4, 5, and 6 students were recruited from 4 elementary schools in Singapore. Three hundred six participants were from Grade 4 (mentees) while 134 were from Grades 5 and 6 (mentors). A quasi-experimental design was used. Participants in the experimental condition received the interventions (iZ HERO exhibition visit and Story Quest gameplay) after the baseline data collection. Mentees' perceptions regarding the iZ HERO exhibition were positive. The program was successful in improving students' attitudes toward offline meetings, attitudes toward playing games instead of doing homework, and cyberbullying. Ratings of their mentoring experience were related to positive changes in attitudes. The program did not improve students' attitude in the other online risky behaviors such as attitudes toward pornography. The results, reasons for its effectiveness, and limitations of the study are discussed.

Proponents of the effects argue that there are no meaningful differences save violent content between the violent and nonviolent games played, while critics of the effects argue that their nonsignificant study results constitute evidence for the null hypothesis of no difference. However, neither argument can be supported through the use of traditional null-hypothesis significance testing, as such tests can only ever reject or retain the null, never rejecting the alternative hypothesis in favor of the null. Therefore, to evaluate these claims, we apply a more appropriate Bayesian analysis to measure evidence for or against the null hypothesis relative to reasonable alternative hypotheses. We conclude that current methodological standards cannot rule out substantial confounds between violent and nonviolent video games. Furthermore, we find that studies that claim to find an absence of violent video game effects vary substantially in the strength of evidence, with some strongly supporting the null, others weakly supporting the null, and some others finding evidence of differences between conditions. We recommend the use of Bayesian analyses, larger sample sizes, and the creation of custom-designed games for experimental research. © 2015 American Psychological Association.","aggression; Bayesian analysis; null hypothesis significance testing; video games; Violent media",,,,,,"National Science Foundation, NSF: SES-102408, BCS-1240359","This work is supported in part by the Bond Life Sciences Fellowship awarded to Joseph Hilgard and by the National Science Foundation Grants BCS-1240359 and SES-102408 to Jeffrey Rouder.",,"Adachi, P.J.C., Willoughby, T., The effects of video game competition and violence on aggressive behavior: Which characteristic has the greatest influence?

Social interactions today are increasingly technologically mediated, with a large number of children and adolescents interacting with others online. Nonetheless, little effort has been made to connect the construct of social competence to online interactions. This article reviews recent research (up to 2014) on social interactions online and tries to identify ways in which components of social competence from offline settings (e.g., adaptability, social skills, perspective-taking) might apply to online contexts. Challenges of applying the construct to online peer interactions are highlighted and the current gaps in research are identified, raising questions about whether social competence from offline settings can be applied to online ones. Lastly, this review argues for the need for more research directly assessing competence in social interactions online, especially in light of user characteristics such as age and gender.

The influx of reality TV dominating network and cable programming has been highly reflective in its expansion of formats, evident from the variety of narrative themes embedded in reality-based shows. Findings from this exploratory study (N = 274) reveal significant differences in the way college students affectively, cognitively, and behaviorally engage with reality TV. Specifically, identification, interactivity, enjoyment, perceived realism, and perceived competition across 9 reality TV subgenres: dating/romance, makeover/lifestyle, hidden camera, talent, game show, docusoap, sitcom, law enforcement, and court significantly differed. Data provide strong support that programs commonly defined as reality-based offer qualitatively distinct affective, cognitive, and behavioral experiences and gratifications for viewers.

Reality dating programs were chosen because they are unique in their portrayal of ""unscripted"" dating and sexual encounters among ""real-life"" people, set in a competitive context. A total of 45 episodes from 9 reality dating programs were coded for visual and verbal references to alcohol and sexuality. Results indicate that visual references to alcohol consumption, especially portrayals of light drinking, were the most the common type of content, appearing in 58% of all scenes. The majority of verbal references to alcohol were positive in slant, except when specific reasons for or consequences of using alcohol were mentioned, which were more often negative. Visual or verbal references to sexuality occurred in 37% of all scenes, with most depicting physical flirtation and general sexual interest, and few portraying consequences of sexual behavior. Alcohol and sexual content were depicted concurrently in 25% of all scenes, indicating that alcohol is an integral component of dating and sexual scripts portrayed in this genre. This overlap largely reflected the visual depiction of light alcohol consumption in scenes with sexual talk or sexual behavior. Findings are discussed in light of the possibility that reality TV may serve as a source of young people's alcohol and sexual expectancies. © 2015 American Psychological Association.","Alcohol; Media; Reality TV; Sexual behavior",,,,,,,,,"Ahrold, T.K., Meston, C.M., Ethnic differences in sexual attitudes of U.S. college students: Gender, acculturation, and religiosity factors (2010) Archives of Sexual Behavior, 39, pp. 190-202. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10508-008-9406-1; Aubrey, J.S., Sex and punishment: An examination of sexual consequences and the sexual double standard in teen programming (2004) Sex Roles, 50, pp. 505-514. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/B:SERS.0000023070.87195.07; Aubrey, J.S., Olson, L., Fine, M., Hauser, T., Rhea, D., Kaylor, B., Yang, A., Investigating personality and viewing-motivation correlates of reality television exposure (2012) Communication Quarterly, 60, pp. 80-102. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01463373.2012.641830; Austin, E.W., Johnson, K.K., Immediate and delayed effects of media literacy training on third grader's decision making for alcohol (1997) Health Communication, 9, pp. 323-349. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1207/s15327027hc0904_3; Bandura, A., Self-efficacy: Toward a unifying theory of behavioral change (1977) Psychological Review, 84, pp. 191-215. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/0033-295X.84.2.191; Bandura, A., Social cognitive theory of mass communication (2002) Media effects: Advances in theory and research, pp. 121-153. , In J.

The recovery effects of noninteractive media stimuli as well as of media content with negative affective valence, however, are less clear. The present investigation addressed this limitation of prior research on media-induced recovery. In an experiment (N = 99), participants were first exposed to a task to impose work strain and then assigned to one of the 3 experimental conditions: (a) a movie clip with positive affective valence, (b) a movie clip with negative affective valence, or (c) the control condition with no media exposure. The results demonstrate that both media conditions resulted in higher levels of recovery experience and cognitive performance than the nonmedia control condition. Furthermore, exposure to the video clip with negative valence resulted in higher levels of involvement and energetic arousal than exposure to the positive media stimulus. The findings extend prior research by providing a direct test of the recovery potential of noninteractive media and by revealing the differential patterns of recovery effects resulting from exposure to positive and negative media content. © 2015 American Psychological Association.","Affective valence; Media-induced recovery; Noninteractive media",,,,,,,,,"Ahn, D., Annie Jin, S.-A., Ritterfeld, U., Sad movies dont always make me cry (2012) Journal of Media Psychology, 24, pp. 9-18. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1027/1864-1105/a000058; Bartsch, A., As time goes by: What changes and what remains the same in entertainment experience over the life span?

This may be particularly true for video game violence and anger. Yet, few studies have explored the relationship between video game play and more complex emotions, such as guilt and shame. Further, prior research has not explored how exposure to the narratively rich violence found in role-playing video games may cause feelings of guilt. The research experiment presented here (n 184) aims to fill this gap in the literature by explaining how the immoral actions of a video game character impact the player's feelings of guilt. Specifically, results show that playing as a video game character that has committed immoral actions caused players to feel guilty and ashamed, especially if they felt transported or ""wrapped-up"" in the narrative. Exposure to immoral actions also caused players to show increases in aggressive behavioral tendencies. © 2015 American Psychological Association.","Emotion; Narrative; Transportation theory; Video games; Violence",,,,,,,,,"Anderson, C.A., Effects of violent movies and trait hostility on hostile feelings and aggressive thoughts (1997) Aggressive Behavior, 23, pp. 161-178. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/(SICI)1098-2337(1997)23:3-161::AID-AB2-3.0.CO;2-P; Anderson, C.A., Bushman, B.J., Effects of violent video games on aggressive behavior, aggressive cognition, aggressive affect, physiological arousal, and prosocial behavior: A meta-analytic review of the scientific literature (2001) Psychological Science, 12, pp. 353-359. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1467-9280.00366; Anderson, C.A., Carnagey, N.L., Flanagan, M., Benjamin, A.J., Jr., Eubanks, J., Valentine, J.C., Violent video games: Specific effects of violent content on aggressive thoughts and behavior (2004) Advances in Experimental Social Psychology, 36, pp. 199-249. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0065-2601(04)36004-1; Anderson, C.A., Shibuya, A., Ihori, N., Swing, E.L., Bushman, B.J., Sakamoto, A., Saleem, M., Violent video game effects on aggression, empathy, and prosocial behavior in eastern and western countries: A meta-analytic review (2010) Psychological Bulletin, 136, pp. 151-173. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/a0018251; Baron, R.M., Kenny, D.A., The moderator-mediator variable distinction in social psychological research: Conceptual, strategic, and statistical considerations (1986) Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 51, pp. 1173-1182. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/0022-3514.51.6.1173; Brookes, S., Moyer-Guse, E., Mahood, C., (2011) Playing the Story: Transportation As A Mediator of Involvement in Narratively-based Video Games, , Presented to the Games Studies Interest Group of the International Communication Association, Boston, MA; Bushman, B.J., Moderating role of trait aggressiveness in the effects of violent media on aggression (1995) Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 69, pp. 950-960. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/0022-3514.69.5.950; Bushman, B.J., Geen, R.G., Role of cognitive-emotional mediators and individual differences in the effects of media violence on aggression (1990) Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 58, pp. 156-163. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/0022-3514.58.1.156; Bushman, B.J., Huesmann, L.R., Effects of televised violence on aggression (2001) Handbook of Children and the Media, pp. 223-254. , D.

Box 2713, Doha, Qatar","In most violent video games, players are put in stressful situations where enemies are trying to kill them. This is reflected by the results of previous research showing that violent video games increase physiological arousal (e.g., heart rate, blood pressure, galvanic skin response). In this study, I investigate the effect of playing violent video games on emotional stress detected by a new methodology: voice analysis. Because changes and disturbances in vocal responses can be understood as reactions to emotional stress, I expected that violent videogames would increase voice stress. Participants (N 87 French university students; 40% female; Mage 21.2) played either a violent or nonviolent game for 20 min. After game play, participants read a stressprovoking story aloud while their voices were recorded. Voice recordings were analyzed to determine the amount of emotional stress in participants' voices using Automated Voice Stress Analysis. As hypothesized, voice stress was higher among violent video game players than among nonviolent video game players. Voice stress was also higher for men than for women. No interaction between video game content and the gender of participants was observed. This study confirms that violent video games have physiological consequences on players, as predicted by the General Aggression Model and also introduces a promising nonobtrusive physiological measure in media psychology research. © 2015 American Psychological Association.","Violent video games; Voice stress",,,,,,,,,"Anderson, C.A., Bushman, B.J., Human aggression (2002) Annual Review of Psychology, 53, pp. 27-51. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1146/annurev.psych.53.100901.135231; Anderson, C.A., Shibuya, A., Ihori, N., Swing, E.L., Bushman, B.J., Sakamoto, A., Saleem, M., Violent video game effects on aggression, empathy, and prosocial behavior in eastern and western countries: A meta-analytic review (2010) Psychological Bulletin, 136, pp. 151-173. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/a0018251; Bartholow, B.D., Bushman, B., Sestir, M.R., Chronic violent video game exposure and desensitization to violence: Behavioral and eventrelated brain potential data (2006) Journal of Experimental Social Psychology, 41, pp. 489-496; Blumler, J.G., Katz, E., (1974) The Uses of Mass Communications: Current Perspectives on Gratifications Research, , Beverly Hills, CA: Sage; Damphousse, K.R., Pointon, L., Upchurch, D., Moore, R.K., (2007) Assessing the Validity of Voice Stress Analysis Tools in A Jail Setting, , National Institute of Justice.

We conducted an online survey of 198 adults within about 1 month of the event. Perceived negative influence of news on others' attitudes, but not self, was higher for those who had greater experience with mental illness. Fear predicted perceived news influence on self (but not others), primarily for people who had no personal experience with mental illness. Further, for people without mental illness experience, perceived news influence on their own attitudes toward mental illness was associated with more engagement in support/comfort activities and greater likelihood of online opinion expression. In contrast, for people with mental illness, perceiving that others' attitudes had become more negative was associated with less engagement in support/comfort activities. Finally, perceived news influence on self was related to less willingness to disclose mental health treatment. Implications of the findings are discussed from the perspective of the influence of presumed influence model and intergroup emotions theory. © 2015 American Psychological Association.","Influence of presumed media influence; Mental health; Mental illness; News media; Stigma",,,,,,,,,"Angermeyer, M.C., Schulze, B., Reinforcing stereotypes: How the focus on forensic cases in news reporting may influence public attitudes towards the mentally ill (2001) International Journal of Law and Psychiatry, 24, pp. 469-486. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0160-2527(01)00079-6; Atwell Seate, A., Cohen, E., Fujioka, Y., Hoffner, C., Exploring gun ownership as a social identity to Understanding the perceived media influence of the Virginia Tech news coverage on attitudes toward gun control policy (2012) Communication Research Reports, 29, pp. 130-138. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/08824096.2012.667773; Atwell Seate, A., Mastro, D., Exposure to immigration in the news: The impact of grouplevel emotions on intergroup behavior (2015) Communication Research, , http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0093650215570654, Advance online publication; (2007) Killers Manifesto: You Forced Me into A Corner, , http://www.cnn.com/2007/US/04/18/vtech.shooting/index.html, CNN, April 18.

The purpose of this study was also to understand how portrayals of situation comedy fathers and their interactions with their children vary by race, class, marital status, and TV channel. Four hypotheses were tested using data collected from 699 father child interactions across 10 current situation comedies. Results suggest that father child interactions do not differ based on race or ethnicity, but they do depend on fathers' class, marital status, and the channel that airs the TV show.

It is based on the emotion-Attribution theory of interest (Silvia, 2006), which addresses both the development of short-Term and long-Term interests of individuals and on two-process models of entertainment experiences during media consumption (Vorderer & Reinecke, 2012). The results of a between-subjects online experiment (N = 201) partially support the theory's basic assumptions. Further, they reveal supporting preconditions prompted by the programs and their audience, with the most important one being eudaimonic entertainment experiences of the audience. Taken as a whole, the findings suggest political entertainment programs to be powerful resources for eliciting interest in politics among citizens. © 2015 American Psychological Association.","Emotion psychology; Entertainment experiences; Experiment; Interest as emotion; Political interest",,,,,,,,,"Aiken, L.S., West, S.G., (1991) Multiple Regression: Testing and Interpreting Interactions, , Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage; Anderson, J.R., A spreading activation theory of memory (1983) Journal of Verbal Learning and Verbal Behavior, 22, pp. 261-295. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0022-5371(83)90201-3; Ashby, F.G., Isen, A.M., Turken, A.U., A neuropsychological theory of positive affect and its influence on cognition (1999) Psychological Review, 106, pp. 529-550. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/0033-295X.106.3.529; Bartsch, A., Hartmann, T., The role of cognitive and affective challenge in entertainment experience (2015) Communication Research, , http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0093650214565921, Advance online publication; Bartsch, A., Schneider, F.M., Entertainment and politics revisited: How non-escapist forms of entertainment can stimulate political interest and information seeking (2014) Journal of Communication, 64, pp. 369-396. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jcom.12095; Baum, M.A., Sex, lies, and war: How soft news brings foreign policy to the inattentive public (2002) The American Political Science Review, 96, pp. 91-110. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0003055402004252; Baumgartner, J.C., Morris, J.S., (2008) Laughing Matters: Humor and American Politics in the Media Age, , New York, NY Routledge; Beierlein, C., Kemper, C.J., Kovaleva, A., Rammstedt, B., (2012) Ein Messinstrument Zur Erfassung Politischer Kompetenz-und Einflusserwartungen: Political Efficacy Kurzskala (PEKS) [A Measurement Tool for the Assessment of Political Competence and Influence Expectations: Political Efficacy Short Scale (PEKS)], , http://nbn-resolving.de/urn:nbn:de:0168-ssoar-292361, Mannheim, Germany.

In an era of mass media, individuals become acquainted with media personae, expanding greatly the pool of available attachment objects. This increases the possibility of a parasocial attachment, defined as a nonreciprocated attachment to a familiar other, and from whom one derives safe haven and felt security. This paper addresses 2 questions: From an evolutionary perspective, what is the expected way that viewers should perceive and react to attractive and familiar media personae? Second, as human beings evolve socially in a mediated environment, will parasocial attachments be adaptive or will they encourage, as a result of confusion over ""real"" versus parasocial relationships, some measure of dysfunction? Based on data collected during participant observer ethnography within active fan groups, parasocial attachment to celebrities would be a likely outcome of repeated exposure to those celebrities in visual media. The Media Equation (Reeves & Nass, 1996) states that human perceptions do not differentiate between those that emanate from the real world and those that come from media, helping explain the strong feelings that some media viewers develop for personae only encountered through media. The conclusion is that attachment to celebrities and even celebrity worship itself is to be expected, rather than being an abnormal and an aberrant manifestation of human behavior. Although most case examples of parasocial attachment appeared to support positive functioning, in some cases parasocial attachments can be problematic. © 2015 American Psychological Association.","Attachment; Audience Studies; Celebrity-Fan Relationships; Evolutionary Theory; Parasocial",,,,,,"Borders","personal relationships. As a participant observer over a period of many years, it was possible to see long-term outcomes in many individuals and the finding that the fan attachment had disrupted or made the fan’s life difficult was definitely observed in a small number of cases. However, for the vast majority of fans in Josh Groban, Michael Jackson, and Star Trek fandoms in particular (where the most data were collected), the fan interest in the celebrity played the role of an important friendship or a particularly interesting hobby. In some cases, it guided the philanthropic activity of the fan by connecting him or her with opportunities to support charities supported by the celebrity. For examples, see the Find Your Light Foundation of Josh Groban, or the funds raised for charities like Save the Children, The Heifer Project, Amnesty International, Doctors without Borders, and other similar causes by the Star Trek fans observed.",,"Ainsworth, M., (1978) Patterns of Attachment: A Psychological Study of the Strange Situation, , Hillsdale, NJ Erlbaum; Blehar, M., Lieberman, A., Ainsworth, M., Early face-To-face interaction and its relation to later infant-mother attachment (1977) Child Development, 48, pp. 182-194. , http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1128897; Bowlby, J., (1969) Attachment and Loss, 1. , Attachment.

Previous research suggests that readers of online content about race may react more negatively to authors who are members of stigmatized racial groups. In 2 studies, we tested this possibility with respect to online content written by Black and White authors. In Study 1, we analyzed readers' comments on actual race-related opinion-editorial (op-ed) essays published on The New York Times' Room for Debate blog over a 1-year period. As predicted, readers wrote more (and more negative) comments on Black authors' op-eds compared to comments written on White authors' op-eds. Study 2, which included information about the readers, revealed that people who rate themselves as likely to comment online are also more likely to have negative reactions to Black authors' content.

Using the context of one of the most widespread media phenomena dominating popular culture-the Harry Potter franchise, results of an online questionnaire (N 235) indicated that individual differences among fans (i.e., narrative exposure and eudaimonic motivation or the desire to seek meaning from entertainment) predicted involvement in fan communities. Further, perceived membership in fan communities enhanced enjoyment, appreciation, physiological reactions, knowledge acquisition, and intentions to seek fan-related materials. Implications for expanding entertainment scholarship in the study of meaningful media related to fandom and our understanding of contemporary forms of fandom in light of new technological affordances are discussed. © 2015 American Psychological Association.","Eudaimonia; Fandom; Involvement; Meaning; Participation",,,,,,,,,"Abelman, R., Atkin, D.J., (2002) The Televiewing Audience: The Art & Science of Watching TV, , Cresskill, NJ: Hampton Press; Algoe, S.B., Haidt, J., Witnessing excellence in action: The 'other-praising' emotions of elevation, gratitude, and admiration (2009) The Journal of Positive Psychology, 4, pp. 105-127. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/17439760802650519; Bartsch, A., Vorderer, P., Mangold, R., Viehoff, R., Appraisal of emotions in media use: Toward a process model of meta-emotion and emotion regulation (2008) Media Psychology, 11, pp. 7-27. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15213260701813447; Baym, N., (2000) Tune In, Log On: Soaps, Fandom, and Online Community, , Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage; Baym, N., The new shape of online community: The example of Swedish independent music fandom (2007) First Monday, , http://dx.doi.org/10.5210/fm.v12i8.1978, Advance online publication; Bird, C., Phenomenological realities or Quinntown: Life in a cyber community (2002) Journal of American and Comparative Cultures, 25, pp. 32-37. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1542-734X.00006; Branscombe, N., Wann, D., Role of identification with a group, arousal, categorisation processes and self-esteem in sports spectator aggression (1992) Human Relations, 45, pp. 1013-1033. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/001872679204501001; Brown, J.D., Schulze, L., The effects of race, gender, and fandom on audience interpretations of Madonna's music videos (1990) Journal of Communication, 40, pp. 88-102. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1460-2466.1990.tb02264.x; Carver, C.S., Scheier, M.F., (1981) Attention and Self-regulation: A Control-theory Approach to Human Behavior, , http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4612-5887-2, New York, NY: Springer-Verlag; Castells, S., (2000) The Rise of the Network Society, , Oxford, UK: Blackwell Publishers; Cohen, J., Favorite characters of teenage viewers of Israeli serials (1999) Journal of Broadcasting and Electronic Media, 43, pp. 327-345. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/08838159909364495; Cohen, J., Defining identification: A theoretical look at the identification of audiences with media characters (2001) Mass Communication and Society, 4, pp. 245-264. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1207/S15327825MCS0403-01; Cohen, J., Parasocial breakups: Measuring individual differences in responses to the dissolution of parasocial relationships (2003) Mass Communication and Society, 6, pp. 191-202. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1207/S15327825MCS0602-5; Cohen, J., Parasocial break-up from favorite television characters: The role of attachment styles and relationship intensity (2004) Journal of Social and Personal Relationships, 21, pp. 187-202. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0265407504041374; Cohen, J., Audience identification with media characters (2006) Psychology of Entertainment, pp. 183-197. , J.

This research reports the development of a survey designed to compare preferences for mediated versus face-to-face (F2F) social support in an important health context: sobriety recovery. The SSPS (Sobriety Support Preference Scale) consisting of 2 parallel subscales representing preference for mediated (0.94) versus F2F (0.91) support was developed for use in this study. One hundred and ninety-six adults (141 female) who reported using both mediated and face-to-face sobriety support completed the SSPS. Results indicated that respondents preferred F2F over mediated sobriety support, although there were positive reactions to mediated support. Participants reported that they felt it was easier for them to be honest in F2F than mediated settings. However, results also indicated that participants reported specifically (a) lying more about their sobriety success and (b) being drunk or high more often while attending F2F sessions than while participating via mediated sobriety support. Frequency of attendance for F2F, but not mediated, support was positively correlated with sobriety success. Post hoc analyses suggest that results varied based on whether participants were recovery professionals in addition to being in recovery. Future research might profitably adapt the 2 subscales of the SSPS to fit other contexts where comparison of mediated and F2F social support efficacy and attitudes are sought. © 2015 American Psychological Association.","Alcohol abuse; Recovery; Sobriety support; Social media; Substance abuse",,,,,,,,,"Aboujaoude, E., Problematic Internet use: An overview (2010) World Psychiatry; Official Journal of the World Psychiatric Association (WPA), 9, pp. 85-90. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/j.2051-5545.2010.tb00278.x; Ahmad, I., Social media engagement and usage stats and facts (2014) Social Media Today, , http://www.socialmediatoday.com/content/globalinternet-mobile-and-social-media-engagement-andusage-stats-and-facts-infographic; (2011) Alcoholics Anonymous-over 70 Years of Growth, , http://www.aa.org/aatimeline/timeline-h6.php?lang-en, Alcoholics Anonymous; (2001) Alcoholics Anonymous (4th Ed.), , Anonymous.

Across 2 samples (total n = 527), scores on an adapted version of Stenseng, Rise, and Kraft's (2012) Escapism Scale demonstrated a replicable 2-factor structure, concurrent and convergent with other measures of celebrity interest and the biopsychological theory of personality. Scores on the measure also demonstrated discriminant and predictive validity in terms of divergent associations between selfsuppression and self-expansion with positive and negative affect respectively.

The present study examined the associations of narcissism and self-esteem with the posting of self-photographs (""selfies"") on a popular photo sharing social networking site (i.e., Instagram). Participants were 128 undergraduate students (19 males, 109 females) ranging in age from 18 to 43 (M 20.46, SD 3.59). Selfies were coded according to their frequency relative to participants' nonselfie posts and their apparent themes (i.e., physical appearance, activity/event/location, affiliation with others, collage, other/undifferentiated). The hypothesized relations of narcissism and self-esteem with the posting of selfies independent of theme were not significant. However, there was a significant relation between some dimensions of narcissism and specific categories of selfies (e.g., vulnerable narcissism with physical appearance selfies). The limitations of the present study, particularly in terms of sampling and other issues that may influence online presentations, as well as the implications for future research on social media photographic displays are discussed. © 2015 American Psychological Association.","Narcissism; Self-esteem; Selfie; Social media",,,,,,,,,"(2013) Abrief History of the Selfie, , http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/10/15/selfie-history-infographic-n-4101645.html, October 15; Baker, R.K., White, K.M., Predicting adolescents' use of social networking sites from an extended theory of planned behaviour perspective (2010) Computers in Human Behavior, 26, pp. 1591-1597; Barry, C.T., Kauten, R.L., Nonpathological and pathological narcissism: Which selfreported characteristics are most problematic in adolescents?

The motivation to copycat behavior and level of risk criminality are predictors of the likelihood to commit future criminality (LCFC). This study assesses the relationship among empathy, narrative persuasion, risk, media influence, need for cognition (NFC), copycat motivation, and the LCFC. Utilizing a sample of 373 respondents across three categories, detention center, high-and low-risk schools (Mage = 16.5, SD = 1.6), face to face interviews were conducted with a standardized questionnaire. Findings from a structural equation model (SEM) indicate that risk and copycat motivation have the strongest positive direct relationship with LCFC. Empathic concern and narrative persuasion were inversely and positively related, respectively, to copycat motivation.

College students (N 188) completed an online questionnaire where they identified their favorite celebrity, answered demographic questions, and completed measures on celebrity PSIs and celebrity identification. As predicted, participants reported greater PSI than identification with their favorite celebrities, and participant gender and age were significantly related to celebrity gender and age. However, choice of celebrity was not based on race of celebrity and participant. Also, having lower PSI scores, greater celebrity identification, and being female significantly predicted choosing a female celebrity. But, having lower PSI scores, greater celebrity identification, and being older significantly predicted choosing an older celebrity.

A number of studies investigating gendered race stereotypes have found that Blacks in North American society are represented and conceived as prototypically masculine, while Asians are represented and conceived of as prototypically feminine. This study examined whether patterns consistent with gendered race prototypes appear in mass media depictions, specifically in popular magazines, such that Asian men and Black women are proportionally less likely than other groups to be depicted. The perceived race and gender of 8,672 individuals depicted within 5 issues each of 6 popular magazines were examined quantitatively to examine whether individuals from nonprototypical gendered race categories were less likely to be depicted. The results indicated that Asian women were more likely to be depicted than Asian men, while Black men were more likely to be depicted than Black women, relative to Whites. These results suggest that, consistent with theories of gendered race and intersectional invisibility, individuals deemed less prototypical of their race and gender categories are rendered invisible in societal representations. © 2015 American Psychological Association.","Gendered race; Intersectionality; Invisibility; Magazines; Mass media",,,,,,,,,"Babbitt, L.G., An intersectional approach to Black/White interracial interactions: The roles of gender and sexual orientation (2013) Sex Roles, 68, pp. 791-802. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11199-011-0104-4; Baker, C.N., Images of women's sexuality in advertisements: A content analysis of Black-and White-oriented women's and men's magazines (2005) Sex Roles, 52, pp. 13-27. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11199-005-1190-y; Ballaster, R., Beetham, M., Frazer, E., Hebron, S., (1991) Women's worlds: Ideology, femininity and the woman's magazine, , London, United Kingdom: Macmillan; Bem, S.L., Gender schema theory: A cognitive account of sex typing (1981) Psychological Review, 88, pp. 354-364. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/0033-295X.88.4.354; Burke, D., Nolan, C., Hayward, W.G., Russell, R., Sulikowski, D., (2013) Is there an own-race preference in attractiveness?

The present study examined the associations between the individual difference variable of authenticity (measured via relationship and dispositional authenticity), relationship awareness on Facebook (conveyed through posting one's relationship status as being ""in a relationship,"" displaying a ""partnered"" relationship status, posting pictures with one's partner, and posting status updates including or about one's partner), and overall relationship quality among college students. Furthermore, relationship awareness on Facebook was explored as a possible mediator of the relationship between authenticity and relationship quality. After controlling for dispositional authenticity, we found a direct relationship between relationship authenticity and relationship quality such that individuals who demonstrated a higher degree of relationship authenticity tended to report higher levels of relationship quality. In addition, results revealed an indirect effect of relationship authenticity on relationship quality through relationship awareness. Our findings suggest that those high in relationship authenticity may be more intrinsically motivated to express themselves as part of a couple on Facebook, which in turn may affect their global relationship functioning. This study offers a method of studying relationship awareness in an online context. © 2014 American Psychological Association.","Authenticity; Relationship satisfaction; Social media; Social networking",,,,,,,,,"Acitelli, L.K., Relationship awareness: Crossing the bridge between cognition and communication (2002) Communication Theory, 12, pp. 92-112. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1468-2885.2002.tb00261.x; Acitelli, L.K., Knowing when to shut up: Do relationship reflections help or hurt relationship satisfaction?
