This article addresses that gap by analyzing how 199 press releases from NASA’s Curiosity mission depict science. Results indicate that the releases often cover Curiosity’s tools and activities, occasionally feature scientists at work, and rarely mention controversies. Ultimately, these press releases provide the public an engaging but partial perspective on science in the making. © 2019, © 2019 Association of Teachers of Technical Writing.","Bruno Latour; Curiosity; NASA; press releases; science in the making","NASA; Public relations; Bruno Latour; Curiosity; Press release; S-tools; science in the making; Presses (machine tools)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Arnold, K., Presenting science as product or as process: Museums and the making of science (1996) Exploring Science in Museums, pp. 57-78. , Pierce S.M., (ed), London, U.K.: The Athlone Press,.

The responses of the total group of respondents and a subset of respondents identifying as a person of color (POC) are compared. Results show that both the overall group and the group of students identifying as persons of color see their TPC programs as both diverse and supportive of diversity. Respondents identifying as a person of color also reported that they were not worried about fitting in when enrolling in their TPC programs. However, the survey also shows that TPC students who identify as persons of color note a lack of students and faculty of color in TPC academic programs and departments. Possible reasons for respondents’ perceptions of having diverse and supportive departments while also observing the lack of POC within the department are discussed. © 2019, © 2019 Association of Teachers of Technical Writing.","critical theory; Programmatic research; social theory","Color; Surveys; Academic program; critical theory; Graduate students; Professional communication; Social theory; Student perceptions; Students",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Agboka, G.Y., Participatory localization: A social justice approach to navigating unenfranchised/disenfranchised cultural sites (2013) Technical Communication Quarterly, 22 (1), pp. 28-49; Bartlett, L., Brayboy, B.M., Race and schooling: Theories and ethnographies (2005) The Urban Review, 37 (5), pp. 361-374; Bell, D.A., Brown v.

Second, how do the subjects of medical digital imaging become persuaded to accept this role? Engaging with medical imaging and the technical communication surrounding it as an assemblage of technical rhetorics (Frost & Eble) and thus a technology, this project shows that women are more commonly scanned as a result of social biases. Further, this article argues that the ubiquity of scanning of women’s bodies has implications for political agency and privacy and for technical communicators’ understandings of efficiency. This study is preliminary but presents compelling evidence that further research on the technical communication surrounding gender and medical imaging is necessary. © 2020, © 2020 Association of Teachers of Technical Writing.","Apparent feminism; efficiency; gender; medical imaging; medical rhetorics; technical rhetorics","Ultrasonics; Digital imaging; Research questions; Technical communications; Technical communicators; Technical rhetoric; Medical imaging",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"(2012) Abortion; ultrasound required at least 24 hours prior to undergoing procedure Act of 2012, SB 484, 111th Cong. of Virginia, , http://leg1.state.va.us/cgi-bin/legp504.exe?121+sum+SB484, Retrieved from; (2011) Abortions Act of 2011, CS/HB 1127, 110th Cong. of Florida, , http://flsenate.gov/Session/Bill/2011/1127, Retrieved from; (2019) Recommendations for prostate cancer early detection, , https://www.cancer.org/cancer/prostate-cancer/early-detection/acs-recommendations.html, Retrieved from; (2019) Ultrasound exams–ACOG, , https://www.acog.org/Patients/FAQs/Ultrasound-Exams, Retreived from; (2012) Entertainment ultrasound, , http://www.aium.org/patients/entertainment.aspx, Retrieved from; (2012) Prudent use in pregnancy official statement, , http://www.aium.org/officialStatements/33, April, 1, Retrieved from; (2019) Prudent clinical use and safety of diagnostic ultrasound, , https://www.aium.org/officialStatements/34, May, 20, Retrieved from; Andrews, L., Black Feminism’s minor empiricism: Hurston, combahee, and the experience of evidence (2015) Catalyst: Feminism, Theory, Technoscience, 1 (1), pp. 1-38; Andrus, J., A legal discourse of transparency: Discursive agency and domestic violence in the technical discourse of the excited utterance exception to hearsay (2011) Technical Communication Quarterly, 20 (1), pp. 73-91; Ashurst, J.V., Cherney, A.R., Evans, E.M., Hall, M.K., Hess, E.P., Kline, J.A., Moore, C.L., Research priorities for the influence of gender on diagnostic imaging choices in the emergency department setting (2014) Academic Emergency Medicine, 21, pp. 1431-1437. , …; Baker, A.F., Pragmatic feminist empiricism: An original analytical framework for technical communication (2017) (Unpublished doctoral dissertation), , East Carolina University,.

We present the Microcore PCS to illustrate the potential of this new type of experiential simulation that incorporates aspects of Alternate Reality Games (ARGs) to increase immersion and teach workplace literacies in the technical communication classroom. We explore results from a pilot test of Microcore with an undergraduate technical communication course, identifying design strategies that worked well and others that led to improvements that are currently being incorporated. We also provide questions to prompt future research of playable case studies and discuss our findings in a broader context of technical communication pedagogy. © 2019, © 2019 Association of Teachers of Technical Writing.","Computer-based learning; curriculum design; digital technologies; instructional technology","Curricula; Engineering education; Scaffolds; Students; Computer-based learning; Curriculum designs; Digital technologies; Instructional technology; Simulated environment; Technical communication pedagogy; Technical communications; Writing instruction; E-learning",,,,,"1323787","This work was funded, in part, by NSF AISL grant [#1323787].",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Abrahamson, C.E., Storytelling as a pedagogical tool in higher education (1998) Education, 118 (3), p. 440; Balzotti, J., Hansen, D., Ebeling, D., Fine, L., Microcore: A playable case study for improving adolescents’ argumentative writing in a workplace context (2017) Proceedings of the 50th Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences; Barnes, L.B., Christensen, C.R., Hansen, A.J., Hansen, T.L., (1994) Teaching and the case method: Text, cases, and readings, , Harvard Business Press; Bay, J.L., Blackmon, S., Inhabiting professional writing: Exploring rhetoric, play, and community in second life (2016) Computer games and technical communication: Critical methods and applications at the intersection, pp. 211-231. , Routledge, &,.

The paper draws on lines of scholarship in the digital humanities and computational rhetoric–primarily, sequential structuring of semantic contexts, semantic parsing of unstructured text, and diachronic tracking of textual expressions–to extend their conceptual and methodological insights into a computational framework for assessing rhetorical effectiveness.

Ceccarelli’s On the Frontier of Science (2013), for example, looks to the institutional practices of the National Science Foundation (NSF) and to actual audience responses to demonstrate the effectiveness, or lack thereof, of a specific metaphor. Leff’s (2001) revisiting of Lincoln at Cooper Union puts the text in conversation with its social and political context. Foust and Murphy (2009) analyze frame success in newspapers. DeVasto’s (2016) new materialist framework looks to material practices as evidence of rhetorical work. Harris (2005) argues for reception studies in the rhetoric of science (and, presumably, rhetoric more generally; see also Kelly et al., 2010).

Through reflective self-narratives, the intern describes specific emotions she experiences as she adjusts to this German workplace.

In this environment, studying human-networked interactions involves an expanded type of usability. In this article, we argue that a key component of usability is how humans connect and disconnect from these networks. For this reason, the authors advocate studying how users connect and disconnect between online and offline contexts in their everyday life.

Specifically, it draws on Kenneth Burke’s writings on recalcitrance to theorize the materialities of rhetorical invention. It takes X-rays as a case study in recalcitrance-driven invention, focusing on two particular applications, traditional medical X-rays, a pervasive category of contemporary technical communication, and backscatter X-ray airport security scans, a controversial and short-lived one. Its analysis shows how recalcitrance (1) is harnessed as means of technical invention and (2) is key to invention’s bidirectionality, by which our material interventions, in turn, work upon us. © 2019, © 2019 Association of Teachers of Technical Writing.","Invention; Kenneth Burke; new materialism; recalcitrance; rhetoric","Airport security; Backscatter x-rays; Bidirectionality; Kenneth Burke; Medical X-rays; new materialism; recalcitrance; rhetoric; Technical communications; Patents and inventions",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"http://cargocollective.com/4thamendment/4th-Amendment-Wear, Retrieved from; Adey, P., Surveillance at the airport: Surveilling mobility/mobilising surveillance (2004) Environment and Planning A, 36 (8), pp. 1365-1380; Adler, A., Carlton, R., (2016) Introduction to radiologic and imaging sciences and patient care, , 6th ed., St. Louis, MO: Elsevier; Barad, K., (2007) Meeting the universe halfway: Quantum physics and the entanglement of matter and meaning, , Durham, NC: Duke University Press; Beeson, S., Mayer, J., (2008) Patterns of light: Chasing the spectrum from Aristotle to LEDs, , New York, NY: Springer; Bennett, J., The agency of assemblages and the North American blackout (2005) Public Culture, 17 (3), pp. 445-466; Bennett, J., (2010) Vibrant matter: A political ecology of things, , Durham, NC: Duke University Press; Boedy, M., From deliberation to responsibility: Ethics, invention, and Bonhoeffer in technical communication (2017) Technical Communication Quarterly, 26 (2), pp. 116-126; Bourdieu, P., (2009) Outline of a theory of practice, , R.

However, they are not powerless, and interviews with 39 female practitioners of TPC reveal that they use interactional power to maneuver within and around the system of the traditional workplace to solve problems of devaluation, exclusion, harassment, and siloing. A key aspect of being able to navigate power through interaction is becoming aware of the context in which power struggles take place and then using that knowledge to design new participation.

It investigates the usability and design-implications of a live-action how-to video, by means of analyzing user-centered data such as YouTube analytics data, usability, and comprehension assessments. In the study, four key live-action video affordances are identified: verifiability, comparability, recordability, and visibility. The identification of these affordances when related to the users’ assessments resulted in several design implementations that would warrant sought-for communication efficacies. Findings show that some assumed efficacies appear to be mitigated by the complexity and the density of the video information. One implication of this is that the implementation of conventional video editing techniques and the addition of on-screen text that serve to make content briefer and more concise into instructional live-action videos requires the technical communicator’s careful consideration. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

He describes two surgical innovations from the mid-19th century, and traces why one (anesthesia) was easily and rapidly adopted, whereas the other (antiseptic) was accepted only slowly, over the course of decades. This happened because the more significant innovation (antiseptic) required a fundamental redefinition of the profession of surgery, including a significant rethinking of the field’s methods and values. Instead of “warriors against disease,” surgeons needed to become scrupulously sterile practitioners of cleanliness—and many, advanced in their careers, resisted such a change.

Directorate for Education and Human Resources, EHR: 1545275","Scholars in rhetoric and writing studies have a timely opportunity to shape the future of science communication. The National Science Foundation (NSF) and Council of Graduate Schools recently called for graduate programs in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) to incorporate science communication into graduate student training (Linton, 2013). However, a comprehensive approach for training STEM graduate students in science writing and communication remains elusive (Kuehne & Olden, 2015). Yet this move would have far-reaching consequences for scientists and wider communities. Through direct engagement with public stakeholders, scientists have the opportunity to foster greater public trust in the sciences (Lach, List, Steel, & Shindler, 2003; Pace et al., 2010), leading to more compelling and accessible scientific information being conveyed to a broader spectrum of society (Nisbet & Scheufele, 2009) and more effective incorporation of science into social and environmental policy making (Meyer, Frumhoff, Hamburg, & de la Rosa, 2010; Roux, Rogers, Biggs, Ashton, & Sergeant, 2006; Smith et al., 2013).","Here we describe an innovative, cross-disciplinary training program for STEM graduate students and faculty at the University of Rhode Island, funded by the NSF. Key to the program, called SciWrite@URI, is a unique emphasis on rhetoric, which, we argue, is an essential component of science communication education and has been lacking in many previous and existing programs. Emphasizing rhetoric throughout the program of study—and supporting STEM graduate faculty to adopt rhetorically informed writing pedagogy—positions students to challenge a deficit model of science communication (Gross, 1994) and advance critical public engagement with science (Gigante, 2014). SciWrite@URI builds from the idea that science communication training, informed by rhetoric and implemented from the first graduate semester, improves faculty’s teaching and students’ academic writing, public communication, and broader impacts, while improving students’ comprehension of scientific concepts, familiarity with their disciplinary communities, and confidence as writers and scientists.","Support for this project is provided by the National Science Foundation’s Directorate for Education and Human Resources award #1545275.",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Abasi, A.R., Akbari, N., Graves, B., Discourse appropriation, construction of identities, and the complex issue of plagiarism: ESL students writing in graduate school (2006) Journal of Second Language Writing, 15 (2), pp. 102-117; Andrews, E., Weaver, A., Hanley, D., Shamatha, J., Melton, G., Scientists and public outreach: Participation, motivations, and impediments (2005) Journal of Geoscience Education, 53 (3), pp. 281-293; Aneja, G., (2014) Disinventing and Reconstituting Native Speaker Ideologies through the Classroom Experiences of International TESOL Students, , https://repository.upenn.edu/wpel/vol29/iss1/2, Retrieved from; Angelova, M., Riazantseva, A., If you don’t tell me, how can I know?” A case study of four international students learning to write the US way (1999) Written Communication, 16 (4), pp. 491-525; Belcher, D., The apprenticeship approach to advanced academic literacy: Graduate students and their mentors (1994) English for Specific Purposes, 13 (1), pp. 23-34; Blakeslee, A.M., Bridging the workplace and the academy: Teaching professional genres through classroom-workplace collaborations (2001) Technical Communication Quarterly, 10 (2), pp. 169-192; Bonney, R., Phillips, T.B., Ballard, H.L., Enck, J.W., Can citizen science enhance public understanding of science?

Specifically, the work is a biology textbook containing comics-style visual explanations couched in the form of an imaginative story interwoven with and supplementing traditional text-based explanations of the same ideas. The analysis uses Genette’s concept of “paratexts” (i.e., a class of speech genres comprising those supplementary texts that contextualize and inform readers’ interpretations of the primary text that they accompany) to examine the rhetoric of the visual in the discourse of science education. This analysis observes that the stigmatization of comics as a medium played some role in how readers, critics, and reviewers responded to the text. The implications of this stigma for cultural conceptions of science and their relationships to other knowledge domains, including the arts and humanities, raise a concern for the mediation of public impressions of science as an institution. © 2017 Association of Teachers of Technical Writing.","Rhetoric of science; visual rhetoric; visualization techniques","Communication; Technical writing; Contextualize; Knowledge domains; Optical solutions; Rhetoric of science; Science education; visual rhetoric; Visualization technique; Reviews",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Birdsell, S., Groarke, L., Outlines of a theory of visual argument (2007) Argumentation and Advocacy, 43 (3-4), pp. 103-113; Callon, M., Law, J., Rip, A., (1986) Mapping the dynamics of science and technology: Sociology of science in the real world, , Basingstoke, England: Macmillan; Cohn, N., Beyond speech balloons and thought bubbles: The integration of text and image (2013) Semiotica, 197 (1), pp. 35-63; Daft, R.L., Lengel, R.H., Organizational information requirements, media richness, and structural design (1986) Management Science, 32 (5), pp. 554-571; Dyehouse, J., A textbook case revisited”: Visual rhetoric and series patterning in the American Museum of Natural History’s horse evolution displays (2011) Technical Communication Quarterly, 20 (3), pp. 327-346; Farmer, L.S.J., Information architecture and the comic arts: Knowledge structure and access (2015) Journal of Visual Literacy, 34 (2), pp. 23-50; Figueiredo, S., Building worlds for an interactive experience: Selecting, organizing, and showing worlds of information through comics (2011) Journal of Visual Literacy, 30 (1), pp. 86-100; Figueiredo, S., AcCOMICating science: Larry Gonick’s “cartoon guides” as models of science textbooks in comics form (2012) Online Journal of Communication and Media Technologies, 2 (1). , [online]; Garfield, E., How scientists can help foster science appreciation [online] (1988) The Scientist, 2 (19), p. 10. , http://www.the-scientist.com/?articles.view/articleNo/9844/title/How-Scientists-Can-Help-Foster-Science-Appreciation/, October; Genette, G., (1997) Paratexts: Thresholds of interpretation, , (J.

This speaks to ongoing tension in the games industry of coding and technology versus art. The authors argue that, in their presentation of game design, leading textbooks attempt to frame the field as one of artistry and technical practice, presenting game design as a type of technical communication. The authors ultimately consider the potential and pitfalls of considering game design as a technical communication field and suggest that this framing presents lens for considering the recently professionalized field. © 2016 Association of Teachers of Technical Writing.","Game design; technical communication; textbook","Design; Textbooks; Game design; Game development; Technical communications; Software design",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"(2015), http://www.gdconf.com/aboutgdc/, Retrieved from; Anthropy, A., Clark, N., (2014) A game design vocabulary: Exploring the foundational principles behind good game design, , New York, NY: Pearson Education; Bogost, I., The rhetoric of video games (2008) The Ecology of Games: Connecting Youth, Games, and Learning, pp. 117-140. , Salen K., (ed), Cambridge, MA: The MIT Press; Brathwaite, B., Schreiber, I., (2008) Challenges for game designers: Non-digital exercises for video game designers, , Boston, MA: Charles River Media, a part of Course Technology; Burke, K., (1996) Language as symbolic action: Essays on life, literature and method, , Berkeley, CA: University of California Press; Condis, M., No homosexuals in star wars?

Considerable scientific uncertainties and variable ranges allow authors to construct preferred versions of the story of atrazine. These incommensurate rhetorical constructions, more the result of competing economic and environmental interests than of any paradigmatic misalignments, have prolonged the dispute not only over atrazine's effects but also over whether its sales should be banned.

A few years before, Hayes had accepted funding from Syngenta to study the effects of atrazine on frogs, and when he and his colleagues discovered strong indication of EDC effects, he reported back to Syngenta who decided not to allow publication of the data. Hayes then secured funding from the National Science Foundation, eventually conducting both field and lab studies and publishing in Nature (Hayes, Haston, et al., 2002) and the Proceedings of the National Academy of Science (Hayes, Collins, et al., 2002). The authors reported serious endocrine-disrupting effects in frogs exposed to levels that had previously been considered safe, as low as 1 ppb of atrazine in water. The papers generated considerable attention in scientific news outlets as well as in the lay press (see Betts, 2002; Yoon, 2002). In response, Syngenta sent out press releases through scientists on its Ecorisk panel who attacked Hayes’ work, mostly by claiming that his findings could not be replicated (see Betts, 2002; Yoon, 2002). Since 2002, several laboratories across the country, including the Hayes’ laboratory, have contributed to a growing database of studies reporting EDC effects of atrazine on amphibians exposed to very low concentrations. At the same time, beginning in 2003, Syngenta-funded studies report no EDC effects.","Using ProQuest Biological Science Collection database, I selected studies published from 2000 to 2013 that addressed the question of whether atrazine (and other agricultural pesticides) inhibited development of amphibians in concentrations considered below the level of nonlethal effects (20 ppb). On the basis of their focus on atrazine and amphibian development, I selected 49 research reports and four literature reviews. Of these, 35, including three reviews, were authored by scientists funded by non-industry sources—the National Science Foundation, the NIH, and the like. All but four of these non-industry-funded studies report EDC effects. The remaining 14 were authored by scientists belonging to the Syngenta-funded Ecorisk panel. I read all of these papers carefully and created a data map based on the following text features:",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Ackerman, F., The economics of atrazine (2007) International Journal of Occupational and Environmental Health, 13, pp. 441-449; Allran, J.W., Karasov, W.H., Effects of atrazine on embryos, larvae, and adults of anuran amphibians (2001) Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry, 20 (4), pp. 769-775; Aviv, R., (2014) A Valuable Reputation.

For some of these women, organizing was an occupational closure strategy of revolutionary usurpation: They may have hoped to position themselves favorably to shape a future profession that was not predicated on hidden forms of their inclusion. Exclusionary and demarcationary forces, however, seem to have ultimately undermined their efforts, alienating some of them and inducing others to adopt a strategy of inclusionary usurpation. In addition to using gender-sensitive revisions of occupational closure theory to explain the phenomenon of the woman organizer, the author chronicles the emergence of 8 professional associations for technical communicators and identifies the women technical communicators who helped to organize them. © 2015 © Association of Teachers of Technical Writing.","history; profession; professionalassociations; technicalcommunication; women","History; Technical writing; Closure theory; profession; professionalassociations; Technical communications; Technical communicators; technicalcommunication; women; Professional aspects",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Abbott, A., Professionalism and the future of librarianship (1998) Library Trends, 46 (3), pp. 430-443; Acker, J., Hierarchies, jobs, bodies: A theory of gendered organisations (1990) Gender and Society, 4, pp. 139-158; Altman, P.L., The council of biology editors: A 25-year chronology of events (1981) CBE Views, 4 (2), pp. 4-8; Annual Meeting Held, 2 (1), pp. 4-5. , New York.

Both methods draw on network as a framework: a Latourian actor-network theory analysis and a network analysis. The shared object of analysis is a digital humanities and digital media research lab that is the outcome of the collective and coordinated efforts of researchers and other stakeholders at North Carolina State University. The authors show how the two methods are drawn to different objects of study, different data sources, and different assumptions about how data can be reduced and made understandable. The authors conclude by arguing that although these methods yield different outlooks on the same object, their findings are mutually informing. © 2015 Association of Teachers of Technical Writing.","actor network; methodology; network analysis; networks","Electric network analysis; Networks (circuits); Social sciences computing; Actor network theory; Actor-network; Digital humanities; Knowledge work; methodology; North Carolina State University; Research methodologies; Shared objects; Digital storage",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Barney, D., (2004) The Network Society, , Cambridge, England: Polity; Burton, P., Wu, Y., Prybutok, V.R., Harden, G., Differential effects of the volume and diversity of communication network ties on knowledge workers' performance (2012) IEEE Transactions on Professional Communication, 55, pp. 239-253; Callon, M., Some elements of a sociology of translation: Domestication of the scallops and the fishermen of St. Brieuc Bay (1986) Power, Action and Belief: A New Sociology of Knowledge?, pp. 196-233. , J.

I coded and analyzed two reports (Bacey & Barry, 2008; Levine et al., 2005) written by research scientists working for California's Department of Pesticide Regulation (DPR) by applying concepts from studies of argument, genre, and visual representations in science. The claim-evidence patterns show initial and summative claims as well as warrants being presented in linguistic forms; however, supporting evidence (i.e., data and backing) is found in numeric, visual, and linguistic forms. These findings highlight the need to extend Toulmin's understanding of claim-evidence relationships into a more robust multimodal model. © 2012 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","claim-evidence patterns; environmental science; multimodal argument; professional writing; science writing; Toulmin; writing in the disciplines (WID)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Bacey, J., Barry, T., (2008) A comparison study of the proper use of Hester-Dendy® samplers to achieve maximum diversity and population size of benthic macroinvertebrates Sacramento Valley, California, , California Environmental Protection Agency (Report No. EH08-2); Corbin, J., Strauss, A., (2008) Basics of qualitative research: Techniques and procedures for developing grounded theory, , Sage Publications; Gee, J.P., (2003) What video games have to teach us about learning and literacy, , Palgrave Macmillan; Kalantzis, M., Cope, B., (2008) New learning: Elements of a science of education, , Cambridge University Press; Kelly, G.J., Bazerman, C., How students argue scientific claims: A rhetorical-semantic analysis (2003) Applied Linguistics, 24 (1), pp. 28-55; Kelly, G.J., Takao, A., Epistemic levels in argument: An analysis of university oceanography students' use of evidence in writing (2002) Science Education, 86, pp. 314-342; Knorr Cetina, K., Laboratory studies: The cultural approach to the study of science (1995) Handbook of science and technology studies, pp. 140-166. , Jasanoff S., editorsMarkle G.

So the people who are primarily funded by the NSF for instance would think that industry work is not interesting enough. First of all, industry would fund you to work on a specific problem, not necessarily whatever you like. So they are calling the shots as opposed to you. Even though it is contract research, they can’t force you to do anything—they just won’t fund you again. Second, it is also that, I don’t know what the issue is generally, but that it is a sort of a second class type of support, that these are problems that are too near term, too pedestrian to get PhD material to work out of, even though we do it all the time at ETAC. So it’s sort of a natural kind of division in the university and I think you see it in our group.

This article explores the notion of reciprocity as a way for scholars to gain agency in the CCM discourse. The author argues that innovation diffusion studies can provide rich opportunities for enacting reciprocity. She offers her own CCM diffusion study to demonstrate the potential value of this model. © 2011 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Abel, S., The Content Wrangler: Content is A Business Asset Worthy of Being Managed, , http://thecontentwrangler.com/, (n.d.), [Web log].

Indeed, I argue, the measurement of accuracy using an empirical standard creates a situation in which the speaker's rhetorical concerns and the context can be ignored. © 2011 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,"Domestic violence; Legal concepts; Social norm; Communication; Transparency",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Allen, J., The case against defining technical writing (2004) Teaching Technical Communication: Critical Issues for the Classroom, pp. 67-76. , In J.

We examined 73 forensic reports from a Canadian children's hospital for recurrent strategies geared toward making medical information accessible to nonmedical users; we also interviewed four report writers and five readers.

However, posthuman contexts, such as virtual reality, challenge traditional methods for audience analysis and invention. In virtual environments, knowledge is constructed by and through embodied interactions with people, technologies, spaces, and ideas-and the dual processes of analysis and invention are conflated. In this article, I present data from a semester-long comparative study between two technical communication courses. Students in both courses created instructions for filming in a virtual environment, but students from only one of these courses experienced the space/place of virtual reality. The data emphasize the importance of embodied experiences in technical communication pedagogy and practice. © 2010 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,"Audience analysis; Comparative studies; Dual process; Embodied experience; Embodied interaction; Technical communication pedagogy; Technical communications; User-centered; Communication; Patents and inventions; Students; Virtual reality; Teaching",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Chi, M.T.H., Quantifying qualitative analyses of verbal data: A practical guide (1997) The Journal of The Learning Sciences, 6, pp. 271-315; Dubinsky, J.M., More than a knack: Technê & teaching technical communication (2002) Technical Communication Quarterly, 11, pp. 129-145; Flower, L., Hayes, J.R., A cognitive process theory of writing (1981) College Composition and Communication, 32, pp. 365-387; Hawk, B., Toward a post-technê-or, inventing pedagogies for professional writing (2004) Technical Communication Quarterly, 13, pp. 371-392; Hayles, N.K., (1999) How We Became Posthuman: Virtual Bodies In Cybernetics, Literature, and Informatics, , Chicago: University of Chicago Press; Hettinger, L.J., Berbaum, K.S., Kennedy, R.S., Dunlap, W.P., Nolan, M.D., Vection and simulator sickness (1990) Military Psychology, 2, pp. 171-181; Hollan, J., Hutchins, E., Kirsh, D., Distributed cognition: Toward a new foundation for human-computer interaction research (2000) Human-computer Interaction In the New Millennium, pp. 75-94. , In J.

Using genre theory and play theory to map the respective processes, we found that a systems-based refocusing of audience analysis—namely, genre field analysis—allows researchers a more accurate understanding of their roles as agents within the system.","Studied individually, genres are surprisingly volatile and messy. When we think of a proposal genre, for example, it is rare that we begin by thinking of the relationships formed while preparing a proposal. We tend to think in terms of the content and document features required by a particular solicitation or by solicitations in general. Miller (1984) referred to such generic elements as stabilized social activity. This type of thinking demonstrates the limitations of genre theory in that it tends to isolate player-agents from the other parts of the genre field by focusing them on the various constraints and genre constructs that separate them. For example, the genre-dominated Web site dedicated to soliciting research grant proposals for the National Science Foundation (NSF) creates distance between the proposal writer and the program officer managing the grant. Yet our research indicates that successful grant proposal writers foreground their approach by thinking of the re- lationships they need to cultivate (or have already cultivated) in order to negotiate the system successfully.","This article performs a genre field analysis of the NSF research grant proposal system by comparing the NSF Web site’s funding pages with interview data gathered from NSF research grant proposal writers. We suggest that mapping such systems can improve researchers’ understanding of complex rhetorical situations. Genre field analysis affords researchers micro and macro views of genres at work, the human agents who work with them, and the structures they operate within by blending analytic components from genre theory and play theory. By explicating the often complex networks of action—the rules, agents, strategies, and locales—that must be negotiated so as to secure research monies, researchers can better position themselves within the system to effect change—even limited change—rather than simply accept positions offered them by granting agencies’ generic requirements. Although we hesitate to compare the process of securing research money to a game—even a high-stakes game—doing so metaphorically allows us to view the playing field more clearly and to identify the rules of the game as well as key players and strategic moves.","A genre field consists of the larger networks of influence, structural elements, mediating technologies, and the context surrounding the production or maintenance of any genre, as well as each of the player-agents, genre-agents, transformative locales, and play scenarios that exert force within it. A genre field is very much what Huizinga (1950) called a playground, a sacred space governed by its own rules (p. 14), one that can be studied as separate from its nonattendant influences (Chris-tensen, Cootey, & Moeller, 2007, p. 3). For our purposes in this article, the genre field we analyze contains the NSF research grant funding apparatus, including player-agents from the NSF and researchers at various institutions; genre-agents, including the NSF Web site, proposal requirements, and review criteria; multiple transformative locales where various transactions are conducted and meanings interpreted; and a wide assortment of play scenarios, facilitated by the system and enacted by various agents.","We employ genre field analysis in this study to account for all the forces exerted on the research grant proposal process, from the NSF Web site’s funding pages as well as the attendant networks of meaning surrounding a proposal writer. By looking at the process through this theoretical lens, we view the complexity of the genre field from various perspectives (i.e., generic, social, agential, and contextual), even though all we see initially on the NSF Web site is a collection of genre-dominant instructional pages. These pages are intended to simplify the process and direct proposal writers to the most relevant NSF document that will meet their needs. However, such direction can also limit a player-agent’s perspective of the entire system. As a part of the posthuman project, genre field analysis would inform us that such a complex structure must include more than what is evident on the Web site itself. The Web site obscures several important systemic elements at play behind the visible interface of pages, rules, and requirements.","In this section, we provide a mapping of the NSF research grant proposal system as it is presented by the NSF Web site, a primary transformative locale for player-agents interested in securing funding. The Web site appears to present a comprehensive view of the entire NSF research grant proposal system, and in so doing, it establishes itself as a primary agent over the transformative locale. The net result is an imbalanced system in which player-agents perceive their role as merely responding to the rules and constraints placed upon them by the genre-agent. We present this mapping here, using Anders’ case as an example."," Funding definition, including currently funded programs and documentation defining funding opportunities","Helen is a senior associate dean for mechanical engineering and a vice president for women’s issues at a Carnegie-designated research-extensive university in the Western U.S. She has 10 years of experience at Sandia National Laboratory in Albuquerque, NM. Her success in research grant proposal writing includes a $10 million grant from NSF for the National Center for Engineering and Technology Education.","Irene is an associate professor in a science field with 20 years at a Carnegie-designated research-extensive university in the Western U.S. She not only served as an NSF program officer for 18 months but has also garnered great success as a grant proposal writer with nearly $5 million in funding from multiple grants through both NSF and National Institutes of Health.","Here is where even a careful, systemic mapping may fail to capture the more subtle forces at play within any particular transformative locale if such a mapping is not concerned with the system beyond the genre-agent. We argue, then, that mapping more of the research grant funding process than is depicted by the NSF Web site may expose more transformative locales available to player-agents. If the system includes a greater number of transformative locales than is presented by the Web site, then it is also likely that player-agents can exert additional agency via play scenarios enacted within those hidden transformative locales.","FIGURE 3 Map of the entire NSF genre field for research grant proposals beginning at researcher-program officer negotiation and resulting in an increased likelihood of an award.","The funding model handed down to those of us in the humanities privileges the lone researcher who secures funding to support a lab or to conduct specific experiments. This view is supported by the NSF Web site whose link-driving genre-agents move researchers toward specific funding opportunities. However, our participants urged us to take a view of the process that included larger networks of meaning than those presented by the isolating view of the lone researcher tackling a monstrous undertaking such as a multiyear, multimillion-dollar research grant.","In Irene’s case, the points of negotiation that transpired within the transformative locale indicated by the negotiation play scenarios dominated and strongly influenced the entire proposal process. Rather than focusing on the guidelines established by the NSF Web site, her drafting process was based upon her ongoing negotiations with her program officer, her administrators, and potential collaborators. This is not to say that Irene ignored the genre criteria linked to by the NSF Web site, but it became significantly less influential than it had been in Anders’ case. In our interviews with Irene about her success at NSF, she did not focus on reviewer feedback or the NSF Web site in the way that Anders did. In fact, she only mentioned the reviewers insofar as she thought serving as one would be a good way to meet potential collaborators and come to understand the proposal system. Helen talks about this as having the “inside track.” She states, “My interest in going back to NSF is to help [the dean in my college] . . . We want the inside track now. That’s how [Irene’s big grant] got funded; [Irene] had an inside track.” This inside track, as Helen refers to it, constitutes a deep understanding of the nuances and complexities of the NSF research grant funding genre field. It is an understanding that extends beyond the genre-agents revealed by the Web site. It is an understanding that can account for the various play scenarios available to a researcher within any given transformative locale along the way. It is an understanding that reveals the rules to the researcher, whether those rules are published or not. It is an understanding that exposes the system for its constituent parts that mediate meaning within it.","We would like to express our deepest gratitude to our research participants who gave significant time and effort in helping us understand the NSF research grant proposal system. We also wish to recognize Michael Teagle, undergraduate student in the Professional and Technical Writing Program at USU, for designing our graphics (Figures 1 and 3). We thank the anonymous reviewers for their thoughtful readings and suggestions. Finally, we are grateful to Byron Hawk and Andrew Mara for their guidance in drafting and revising this article.","Bazerman, C., Systems of genre and the enactment of social intentions (1994) Genre and The New Rhetoric, pp. 79-99. , In A.

As teaching technical writing online becomes more widespread, teachers and scholars are identifying ways to increase teaching/learning efficacy. One way of accomplishing this goal is by continually reflecting on different types of student ethos being constructed in an online course. The changes that occur in the ethos development process can be contextualized through activity theory, which emphasizes the dynamic, evolving nature of social environments. Activity theory's focus on cultural history and tools makes it ideal for exploring active communication among multiple participants in an online technical communication environment. The triangle of human activity adapted and developed by Engestrom (1987) provides a framework for exploring ethos as an object within an online course's activity system. © 2009 Taylor & Francis.",,"Active communications; Activity Systems; Development process; Human activities; Institutional setting; Social environment; Teaching/learning; Technical communications; Activity coefficients; Communication; History; Teaching; E-learning",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Artemeva, N., Freedman, A., Just the boys playing on computers: An activity theory analysis of differences in the cultures of two engineering firms (2001) Journal of Business and Technical Communication, 15, pp. 164-194; Billett, S., Workplaces, communities and pedagogy: An activity theory view (2002) Distributed learning: Social and cultural approaches to practice, pp. 83-97. , M.

We draw on existing historical pieces and the contributions provided by many of the first ATTW members to capture the history of ATTW. We describe the major changes in ATTW from 1973-2007 and conclude with our reflections, as well as important questions we believe to be critical to the future of ATTW. © 2009 Taylor & Francis.",,"It focus; Professional identity; Teaching and researches; Communication; Technical writing",,,,,,"the Association of Teachers of Technical Writing.

Readers' self-reporting of task difficulty and the effects of practicing did not notably affect their judgment. © 2008 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Altizer, L., Total hip arthroplasty (1995) Orthopedic Nursing, 14, pp. 7-18; Anderman, E., Midgley, C., Changes in achievement goal orientations, perceived academic competence, and grades across the transition to middle-level schools (1997) Contemporary Educational Psychology, 22, pp. 269-298; Anderson, A., Lynch, T., (1988) Listening, , Oxford, England: Oxford University Press; Beiger, R.G., The necessity and sufficient information for procedural assembly tasks (1982) Paper presented at the annual meeting of American Educational Research Association, , March1982, New York; Beiger, R.G., Glock, M.D., Comprehending spatial and contextual information in picture-text instructions (1986) The Journal of Experimental Education, 54 (4), pp. 181-188; Black, J.B., Turner, T.J., Bower, G.H., Point of view in narrative comprehension, memory and production (1979) Journal of Verbal Learning and Verbal Behavior, 18, pp. 187-198; Bonk, R.J., (1997) Medical writing in drug development: A practical guide for pharmaceutical research, , Binghamton, NY: Haworth Press; Booher, H.R., Relative comprehensibility of pictorial information and printed words in proceduralized instructions (1975) Human Factors, 17, pp. 266-277; Brewer, W.F., Imagery and text genre (1988) Text, 8, pp. 431-438; Brindley, G., Slatyer, H., Exploring task difficulty in ESL listening assessment (2002) Language Testing, 19, pp. 369-394; Brown, G., Yule, G., (1983) Teaching the spoken language, , Cambridge, MA: Cambridge University Press; Burns, M.J., Warren, D.L., Formatting space-related displays to optimize expert and nonexpert user performance (1986) CHI'86 Proceedings, pp. 274-280. , New York: ACM., and; Campbell, M.K., DeVellis, B.M., Strecher, V.J., Ammerman, A.S., DeVellis, R.F., Sandler, R.S., Improving dietary behavior: The effectiveness of tailored messages in primary care settings (1994) American Journal of Public Health, 84, pp. 783-787; Canada, A., Schover, L., Research promoting better patient education on reproductive health after cancer (2005) Journal of the National Cancer Institute Monograph, 34, pp. 98-100; Cronbach, L.J., Snow, R.E., (1977) Aptitudes and instructional methods: A handbook for research in interactions, , New York: Irvington; Daltroy, L.M., Morlino, C.I., Eaton, H.M., Poss, R., Liangm, M.H., Preoperative education for total hip and knee replacement patients (1998) Arthritis Care and Research, 11, pp. 469-478; DeKleer, J., Brown, J.S., Mental models of physical mechanisms and their acquisition (1981) Cognitive skills and their acquisition, pp. 285-309. , Anderson J.R., (ed), Hillsdale, NJ: Erlbaum., and,.

Through a qualitative analysis of client records obtained from a private organization that provides support and rehabilitation for at-risk youth, we explore the ways that structures imposed by the electronic charts limit cohesiveness and disrupt the communication of evaluative information. This disruption, which we argue is imposed by the format of the charts themselves and is reinforced by the institutional structures at work, is pivotal because it potentially impedes effective communication and understanding between the caregivers and providers who access this information. © 2008 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Atkinson, D., Combining diverse approaches in the analysis of scientific discourse (2002) Discourse studies in composition, pp. 201-227. , Barton E., Stygall G., (eds), Cresskill, NJ: Hampton.,.

It argues that the correspondences constituting the analogy served distinct but cooperative ends, requiring Gamow to posit a relatively simple nuclear geometry that set him apart from his contemporaries, mostly shell theorists, and led to his successful derivation of nuclear energy in the fall of 1928. © 2008 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Eudemian ethics (1984) The complete works of Aristotle, pp. 1922-1981. , Barnes J., (ed), Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press,.

As the teachers of scientific and technical writers, we have an opportunity and responsibility to teach them to use analogy without their writing becoming “overly inductive,” as Aristotle warned. To that end, I here offer an analysis of an example of the effective use of analogy in Rodney Brooks's “Intelligence Without Representation.” In this article, Brooks provides a model for incorporating these tools into an argument by building four of them into an enthymeme that clearly organizes his argument. This combination of inductive and deductive reasoning helped the article become a very influential piece of scholarship in artificial intelligence research, and it can help our students learn to use analogy in their own writing. Every one who effects persuasion through proof does in fact use either enthymemes or examples: there is no other way.

Grassroots is an asset-based mapping tool made possible by the Web 2.0 movement, a movement which allows for the creation of more adaptable interfaces by making data and underlying database structures more openly available via syndication and open source software. This article forwards three arguments. First is an argument about the nature of the knowledge work of everyday life, or an argument about the complex technological and rhetorical tasks necessary to solve commonplace problems through writing. Second is an argument about specific technologies and genres of community-based knowledge work, about why making maps is such an essential genre, and about why making asset maps is potentially transformative. Third is an argument about the making of Grassroots itself; a statement about how we should best express, test, and verify our theories about writing and knowledge work. © 2008 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Barton, B.F., Barton, M.S., Ideology and the map: Toward a postmodern visual design practice (1993) Central works in technical communication, pp. 232-252. , Johnson-Eilola J., Selber S.A., (eds), New York: Oxford University Press., and,.

Drawing on my case study of one researcher at a prominent conservation nongovernmental organization (NGO), I have shown how this shift is manifested in the communication of NGO research. My study includes a discourse analysis of this researcher's publications from the forums of both scholarship and advocacy including, as a representation of discourse in the latter forum, gray literature (reports, books, and other texts produced and distributed outside the channels of the academic and publishing industry). I have also drawn on my interviews with this researcher about her publications.

The final section of this essay provides an example of using this framework based on my explorations into my readiness to teach online.

Students quickly learn how much of this effort can be effectively offloaded to a dedicated infrastructure of cognitive resources and how much must be offloaded to less suitable resources, the latter of which incurs important cognitive costs. © 2007, Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Inc.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Augé, M., (1995) Non-places: Introduction to an anthropology of supermodernity., , London: Verso; Bakhtin, M.M., (1986) Speech genres and other late essays, , McGee V.W., Emerson C., Holquist M., (eds), Austin, TX: University of Texas Press., Edited by; Barthes, R., Introduction to the structural analysis of narratives (1977) Image-music-text, pp. 79-124. , Heather S., (ed), Glasgow: Fontana,.

While designers claim that animated/personified interfaces are more intuitive and natural than the traditional point-and-click interfaces that users encounter, this paper aims to show how virtual humans can enact familiar scripts about women's work, circumscribe the range of possible roles and personalities for women, invoke service to others as the primary context for women's work, and objectify women through a not-so-subtle process of linking technology-as-tool to the idea that women are tools, fetishized instruments to be used in the service of accomplishing users' goals. In conclusion, this study develops our field's tools for critiquing technical communication texts and interfaces by focusing attention on the implications of how technologies for interacting with website users are designed. © 2007, Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Inc.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Inc, A., (2004) How to create virtual beauties, , New York: Harper Design International; http://www.alicebot.org, Alice Foundation website ().

In our survey of students, we found that most students felt they had not been mentored. In our ethnography, we found that although students could define the term “mentor”, many were conflicted about its value. This confusion made students less likely to seek out or recognize mentoring opportunities. Students recognized mentoring practices that teachers implemented; however, they did not necessarily identify those practices as “mentoring”. We conclude that confusion arose from students' ambiguous views about mentoring and the lack of standard mentoring practices in the humanities. Therefore, teachers who intend to mentor in the classroom must (a) be more explicit in implementing elements that distinguish mentoring from teaching (e.g., intent and involvement), (b) extend an invitation to students to be mentored, and (c) help students develop a professional identity. © 2007, Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Inc.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Anderson, E.M., Shannon, A.L., Toward a conceptualization of mentoring (1988) Journal of Teacher Education, 39 (1), pp. 38-42; (1998) Reinventing undergraduate education: A blueprint for America's research universities, , Stony Brook, NY: State University of New York; University, B.Y., (2005) Brigham Young University accreditation self-study, 2006: Draft for review and comment, , http://accredit.byu.edu/re-sources/self-study/04_Standard1.pdf?lms=24, August 23,.

This article examines these changes and the ways in which TC programs position themselves amid globalization, in particular the ways in which they use emerging global partnerships to prepare students for global work and citizenship. For this purpose, the authors report on a Council for Programs in Technical and Scientific Communication-supported exploratory study of current partnership initiatives in TC programs. The study indicated a high level of activity, planning, and interest in global partnerships and revealed a range of creative and innovative partnerships that systematically integrate new opportunities for experiential learning, collaborative international research, and civic engagement in a global context into programs and their curricula. Partnerships also emphasize cultural sensitivity, equal partner contribution, and mutual benefit, thus offering alternatives to emerging global trade visions of higher education. The article also identifies key challenges that partnerships face, suggesting implications for programs and the field as a whole to facilitate successful partnerships. © 2007, Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Inc.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Altbach, P.G., Globalisation and the university: Myths and realities in an unequal world (2004) Tertiary Education and Management, 10 (1), pp. 3-25; Altbach, P.G., Higher education crosses borders (2004) Change, 36, pp. 18-25. , bMarch/April; GATS-General Agreement on Trade in Services.

The study analyzes the pedagogical elements of textbooks, using a model of awareness, information, and practice. Applying the Burkean pentad as an analytical tool, the article situates the pedagogical elements of textbooks in four areas: the instructor’s experience, course goals, classroom situation, and teaching techniques. It then describes a tool for textbook and context assessment useful for guiding textbook selection. It reports the results of a contextual inquiry to validate the assessment tool. We conclude that the assessment tool offers instructors a valuable predictor of the fitness of a given textbook to a given instructional situation. © 2006, Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Inc.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"(2001) The Rhetorical Tradition: Readings from Classical Times to the Present, , Bizzell, P., & Herzberg, B.

The resistant acts that interviewees describe begin with a negotiation of discursive alternatives and subject positions framed by the grid of disciplinary rhetoric about breastfeeding. But in some acts of resistance, breastfeeding women use both discursive and bodily actions to disrupt the intelligibility of this grid and what it deems possible. When such disruption occurs, the results are unpredictable and so must be understood as more than the occupation of preexisting subject positions. © 2006, Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Inc.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Breastfeeding and the use of human milk (1997) Pediatrics, 100, pp. 1035-1039; Apple, R.D., (1987) Mothers and Medicine: A Social History of Infant Feeding, 1890–1950, , Madison: University of Wisconsin Press; Biesecker, B., Michel Foucault and the question of rhetoric (1992) Philosophy and Rhetoric, 25, pp. 351-364; Blum, L.M., (1999) At the Breast: Ideologies of Breastfeeding and Motherhood in the Contemporary United States, , Boston: Beacon; Britt, E.C., (2001) Conceiving Normalcy: Rhetoric, Law, and the Double Binds of Infertility, , Tuscaloosa: University of Alabama Press; (2003) Cnn.Com, , http://www.cnn.com/2003/US/West/11/12/breastfeeding.apology.ap/index.html, Retrieved from; De Certeau, M., (1984) The Practice of Everyday Life, , (S.

This collaborative activity helps students prepare for an increasingly modular professional world by revealing the contingent rhetoricity of professional autonomy. Charettes can help technical writing programs and students integrate service and civic learning into the curriculum by using indigenous professional genres that actively demand stakeholder participation. The intensity and pragmatic force of charettes can assist students in building their ethos while working with fellow stakeholders. The wide range of possible documents involved in the process associated with charettes can help technical communication students and teachers explore the connections between rhetorical exigencies and genre and put their skills to good use in a culture where many are looking for new ways to build critical citizenship. © 2006, Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Inc.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"(1980) The Nicomachean Ethics, , (D.

However, this potential is often not realized. This article reports the results of two case studies using interviews and surveys to examine the evolution of the standards of clients and faculty throughout one semester as well as student perceptions of those standards.

Nanoscale science is an emergent field that examines the principles of matter at a molecular level. This article presents the representations through which nanoscale science and technology was initially introduced to the public. Written popular media influences the ways stakeholder groups perceive, support, and fund science and technology. From 1986 to 1999 this field was introduced to the general public through articles in newspapers, magazines, and other general interest publications. During this period, nanoscale science and technology had a fragmented public image as proponents of various representations of the field competed for legitimacy. The study demonstrates that the emergence of nanoscience and technology in the popular media occurred as a competitive and transitional social–rhetorical process in which the new emerged within existing and established understandings of science but was mediated by biographical and other social accounts of the research. © 2006, Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Inc.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Baake, K., Archaeology reports: When context becomes an active agent in the rhetorical process (2003) Technical Communication Quarterly, 12, pp. 369-387; (1998) Essays in the Study of Scientific Discourse: Methods, Practice, and Pedagogy, , Battalio, J.

The letters of Robert Erskine written in 1770 illustrate the prediscursive methods of technical communication. By the 1860s, a flood of governmental, professional, and commercial publications appeared, each signifying the disappearance of this prediscursive world. This transition from prediscursive to discursive methods may mark one of the largest changes in the history of technical communication. © 2006, Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Inc.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Baer, C.T., A guide to the records of the American Iron & Steel Institute (1998), Hagley Museum and Library, Manuscripts and Archives Department; Boyer, C.S., (1931) Early Forges & Furnaces in New Jersey, , Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press; Brockman, R.J., Bibliography of articles on the history of technical communication (1983) Journal of Technical Writing and Communication, 18, pp. 297-304; Brockman, R.J., William Stillman, Rhode Island mechanician and communicator—his lock patents and acrostics (1996) Journal of Technical Writing and Communication, 26, pp. 21-35; Brockman, R.J., (1998) From Millwrights to Shipwrights to the Twenty-First Century: Explorations in a History of Technical Communication in the United States, , Cresskill, NJ: Hampton; Chard, J., (1995) Making Iron & Steel: The Historical Processes, 1700–1900, , 3rd ed.).

Using grounded theory as a methodological lens, we arrive at two core categories, contact and interactivity, and four subcategories, presence, control, dialogue, and liveliness. After a careful analysis of these categories, we claim that video-based delivery deserves attention because it represents a promising component of distance learning writing instruction. Video allows an instructor to reintroduce talking as a means of learning into the arena of distance education, which tends to be dominated by text-heavy, Web-based methods of delivery. In fact, the emergence of liveliness as a category suggests that, for distant students, active learning occurs during spontaneous discussions made possible by video components. Video-based media that complement text-based interactivity can support social constructionist pedagogy in distance learning. © 2006, Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Inc.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Applebee, A.N., (1996) Curriculum as Conversation: Transforming Traditions of Teaching and Learning, , Chicago: University of Chicago Press; Babin, E., Harrison, K., (1999) Contemporary Composition Studies: A Guide to Theorists and Terms, , Westport, CT: Greenwood; Barker, T., Kemp, F., Network theory: A postmodern pedagogy for the writing classroom (1990) Computers and Community: Teaching Composition in the Twenty-First Century, pp. 1-27. , In C.

That is, they are often seen as arhetorical, and rhetorical choice and agency play a role only in how they are arranged and implemented. In this article, I draw on the notion of translation to provide an alternate account, one that emphasizes the rhetorical nature of research techniques without overdetermining the influence of the environments in which they developed. To illustrate, I examine how one research technique—prototyping—has been translated to fit four different socioeconomic environments, undergoing significant changes in claims and implementation while maintaining enough coherence to be seen as a unitary technique. Finally, I argue that the notion of translation provides us with an account that emphasizes the rhetorical nature of research and our agency as researchers while still acknowledging how techniques constrain our work. © 2005, Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Inc.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"(2002) Content and Complexity: The Role of Content in Informationdesign, , Albers, Michael J., and Beth Mazur, eds., Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Inc; Bansler, J., Systems Development Research in Scandinavia: Three Theoretical Schools (1989) Scandinavian Journal of Information Systems, 1 (9), pp. 3-20; Bansler, J.P., Kraft, P., Privilege and Invisibility in the New Work Order: A Reply toKyng (1994) Scandinavian Journal of Information Systems, 6 (1), pp. 97-106; Barnum, C.M., (2002) Usability Testing and Research, , New York: Longman; Bazerman, C., (1988) Shaping Written Knowledge: The Genre and Activity of The Experimental Article Inscience, , Madison: U of Wisconsin P; Beabes, M.A., Flanders, A., Experiences with Using Contextual Inquiry to Design Information (1995) TC, 42, pp. 409-420; Berkenkotter, C., Huckin, T.N., (1995) Genre Knowledge in Disciplinary Communication: Cognition/Culture/Power, , Hillsdale, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Inc; Beyer, H., Holtzblatt, K., (1998) Contextual Design: Defining Customer-Centered Systems, , SanFrancisco: Morgan Kaufmann; Bjerknes, G., Shared Responsibility: A Field of Tension, pp. 295-301. , Floyd et al; Bjerknes, G., Bratteteig, T., User Participation and Democracy: A Discussion of ScandinavianResearchon System Development (1995) Scandinavian Journal of Information Systems, 7 (1), pp. 73-98; Blomberg, J., Giacomi, J., Mosher, R., Swenton-Wall, P., Ethnographic FieldMethods and Their Relation to Design (1993) Participatory Design: Principles and Practices, pp. 123-156. , Ed.Douglas Schuler and Aki Namioka.

The results suggest that implicit in U.S. rhetorics of professional communication are valorizations of writing as a mechanism of regulating behavior, of universalism and individual reference points as rhetorical strategies, and of common-law or precedent-setting logic as compositional and interpretive strategies. However, many South American personnel seem predisposed to think of personal interactions as a mechanism of regulating behavior, of particular and collective reference points as rhetorical strategies, and of civil law logic as compositional and interpretive strategies. Thus, widespread claims about the roles of writing to “construct,”; mediate, or regulate organizational behavior need to be contextualized in the predominant rhetorical values of the organizational context. © 2000, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Adelaar, W.F., Spatial Reference and Speaker Orientation in Early Colonial Quechua (1997) Creating Context in Andean Cultures., pp. 135-148. , Howard-Malverde R., (ed), New York: Oxford UP,.

It is possible, however, to see peer review and other strategies as methods by which elites silence or de-authorize voices that pose a threat to their status. This article discusses four methods of forum control— peer review, denial of forum, public correction, and published ridicule.

However, technical communication's disciplinary maturity also means a movement away from practice and from the service course, the foundations of technical communication as a discipline and the sources of its workplace influence. © 1999, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Adams, K.H., (1993) A History of Professional Writing Programs in American Colleges: Years of Acceptance, Growth, and Doubt, , Dallas, TX: Southern Methodist UP; Anderson, P., Brockmann, V.J., Miller, C.R., (1983) New Essays in Scientific and Technical Communication: Research, Theory Practice, , Farmingdale, NY: Baywood, and, eds; Boyer, E.L., (1990) Scholarship Reconsidered: Priorities of the Professorate, , Princeton, NJ: Carnegie Foundation; Connors, R.J., The Rise of Technical Writing Instruction in America (1982) Journal of Technical Writing and Communication, 12, pp. 329-352; Cunningham, D., Editor's Corner (1982) Technical Writing Teacher, 9 (2), p. 57; Cunningham, D., Estrin, H.A., (1975) The Teaching of Technical Writing, , Urbana, IL: NCTE, and, eds; Fearing, B.E., Swallow, W.K., (1995) Technical Writing: Theory and Practice, , New York: MLA, and, eds; (1997) bFox Debbie.

In keeping with these theories, the course provides a context in which students acquire rhetorical skills and strategies necessary to integrate into a discipline-specific discourse community. The authors argue that such a pedagogical approach can be used to design communication courses tailored to the needs of any discipline if the following three key conditions are met: assignments are connected to subject matter courses, a dialogic environment is provided, and the nature of assignments allows students to build on their learning experiences in the course. © 1999, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Adam, C., Artemeva, N., Genre and Situated Learning in the Second Language Classroom Paper presented at the Second International Symposium on Genre: Literacy and Literature, , 15–17 Jan., Vancouver, BC: Simon Fraser University; Artemeva, N., Fox, J., Past, Present, Future: An Overview of Engineering Communication Courses in Academia and WTS Interventions in First-Year Engineering (1995) This Week at Carleton, 16 (10), p. 5; Austin, J.L., (1994) How to Do Things with Words., , Cambridge, MA: Harvard UP; Bakhtin, M.M., The Problem of Speech Genres (1986) Speech Genres and Other Late Essays., pp. 66-102. , Emerson C., Holquist M., McGee V.W., (eds), Austin: U of Texas P,.

Our “service” should help students develop the tools for analyzing language and understanding writing in complex ways. Assignment sequences should engage students in active research to develop four primary literacies: rhetorical, visual, information, and computer. This article focuses on disciplinarity and underlying pedagogical goals in technical writing classrooms by describing a search engine assignment sequence which promotes literate practices in three short reports: 1) A preview/instructions report, 2) An analysis/ evaluation report, and 3) A narrative review of a research activity.

First, the article reviews examples of intuitive ethics in professional communication research. Second, the article suggests that intuition is the naturalization of dominant cultural values and beliefs. Third, the article considers naturalized values within institutions and organizations, demonstrating how naturalized values can lead to unquestioned and oppressive institutional practices. Ethical inquiry, according to this view, investigates and denaturalizes those assumptions that are carried forth by intuition. Fourth, the article offers a pedagogical example of this theory, demonstrating how a group of business communication students investigated the intuitive practices of a non-profit organization. The article concludes by suggesting the value that a “critique of intuition” may have for the teaching, study, and practice of professional ethics. © 1999, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Bourdieu, P., (1990) The Logic of Practice, , Nice R., (ed), Stanford: Stanford UP, [1980], Edited by; Burrell, G., Modernism, Postmodernism, and Organizational Analysis 2: The Contribution of Michel Foucault (1988) Organization Studies, 9 (2), pp. 221-235; Dragga, S., A Question of Ethics: Lessons from Technical Communicators on the Job (1997) Technical Communication Quarterly, 6, pp. 161-178; Fairclough, N., (1992) Discourse and Social Change, , Cambridge, MA: Polity; Foucault, M., (1994) The Birth of the Clinic: An Archaeology of Medical Perception, , Smith A.S., (ed), New York: Vintage, [1963]., Edited by; (1979) Discipline and Punish: The Birth of the Prison, , Sheridan A., (ed), New York: Vintage, [1975]., Edited by; On the Genealogy of Ethics: An Overview of Work in Progress (1984) The Foucault Reader, pp. 340-372. , Rabinow P., (ed), New York: Pantheon,.

This assessment has become more immediate for many educators because of ABET 2000 (Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology), a comprehensive revamping of the way engineering programs are accredited. ABET 2000 criteria require that engineering programs provide evidence of the efficacy of all instruction, including communication. When the new ABET criteria were released, we had already begun a comprehensive evaluation of not only our service courses but also the total writing experience of engineering students at the University of Washington.

The argument proceeds from a case study that demonstrates reliability, stability, and validity in its technical communication service course assessment, tasks, and instructor community.

They should be highlighting the agendas and “narratives” inherent in any text, rather than sustaining a positivist faith in neutrality and objectivity, because students who understand the power of language to shape the workplace (not simply to transmit information) turn out to be the most effective, most successful professionals. This article questions the widespread, largely uncritical importing of corporate paradigms into the technical writing classroom and calls for the university to remain separate from the corporation in its purpose. The article goes on to describe a recently developed senior seminar that challenges students’ assumptions about scientific and technical writing, including their own.

As Internet‐based instruction has become increasingly popular, others are less inclined to struggle with writing their own Web pages but are nonetheless interested in having an instructional Web site. A growing number of course‐construction programs are becoming available which could make Internet‐based instruction more accessible. Only by addressing both pedagogical and technical issues can evaluation of such course creation products provide information useful for thoughtful and appropriate use of that technology to support and extend traditional pedagogies. This article concludes that creating online instructional sites by hand with the help of an HTML editor is generally preferable to using course‐in‐a‐box software because instructors can select the components needed to support their pedagogy and construct successful learning experiences for their students. On the other hand, the dilemma of faculty intimidated by the technical expertise needed to produce even a basic Web site can be ameliorated by the use of course‐in‐a‐box software. However, that software should be seen only as a stepping stone. Instructional sites created by course‐in‐a‐box software certainly are worthwhile, but the course or site produced by this software remains constrained by its box, even if that box is often commodious. © 1999, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Benyon, D., (1997) “Experience with Developing Multimedia Courseware for the World Wide Web: The Need for Better Tools and Clear Pedagogy.”, , http://ijhcs.open.ac.uk/benyon/benyon‐nf.html; Bourne, J., Paradigms for Online Learning: A Case Study in the Design and Implementation of an Asynchronous Learning Networks (ALN) Course (1998) Organization for Asynchronous Learning Networks Journal, , http://www.alm.org/alnweb/journal/issue2/assee.html; Crowley, A., Learning Any Time, Any Place: Wisconsin Technical College System Champions Statewide Internet‐Based Training (1997) PCWeek, p. 26. , 18 Aug; Duchastel, P., A Web‐Based Model for University Instruction (1997) Journal of Educational Technology Systems, 25, pp. 221-228; Duchastel, P., Spahn, S., Design for Web‐Based Learning (1996) Web Net'96, , Oct., http://www.nova.edu/∼duchaste; Fell, S., Greek, C., Internet‐Based Distance Education Courses in Criminology: Prolegomena to Production (1997) Syllabus 97 Conference, pp. 27-30. , July1997, Sonoma, CA. : http://www.fsu.edu/∼crimdo/sonoma/Syllabus‐Conference.html., and; Hawisher, G., Selfe, C., (1989) Critical Perspectives on Computers and Composition Instruction, , New York: Teachers College P; Hawisher, G., LeBlanc, P., (1992) Re‐Imagining Computers and Composition Instruction, , Portsmouth, NH: Boynton/Cook, and, eds; Hiltz, S.R., (1995) The Virtual Classroom: Learning without Limits via Computer Networks, , Norwood, NJ: Ablex; McCollum, K., Colleges Sort through Vast Store of Tools for Designing Web Courses (1997) Chronicle of Higher Education: Information Technology, , 21 Oct., http://www.chronicle.com/; Norton, D., Segaard, M., Duin, A.H., The HTML Decision‐Making Report: Preparing Students for the Information Age Workforce (1997) Computers and Composition, 14, pp. 377-395; O'Sullivan, M., (1995) “Literacies Invited and Denied: Reentry Women's Experience with Computers and Writing in a Two‐Year College.”, , Madison: Diss.

Specifically, we describe the programmatic implementation and assessment approach to evaluate whether student writing improved over the course of the semester. After discussing the reasons for taking a writing-intensive approach to engineering, we analyze the results of a pre-and post-test administered over the span of an academic semester. Although the outcome of our assessment did not show significant improvement, we argue that writing instruction is important for increasing students’ overall learning skills.

Drawing on scholarship in the rhetoric of science and in critical linguistics, we argue that language does affect our perception of reality. Consequently, the language used in some technical documents needs to be reconsidered or even challenged by technical editors. Present textbooks on technical editing do not directly confront this issue, though some scholars have begun to challenge the use of terms such as “studgun.”; We conclude by demonstrating how a critical analysis of metaphors in everyday technical documents would help students question these language choices and draw attention to the consequences of using them. © 1998, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Bailey, C.M., Semiconductor Reliability (1982) Electronics Engineers Handbook, , Fink D., (ed), 2nd ed., New York: McGraw‐Hill,.

This essay develops a Longinian concept and methodology for technical communication by comparing his ideas to current scholarship and then applying them to two technical texts. It shows how and why technical writers employ stylistic elements to achieve transport. © 1998, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Barton, B.F., Barton, M.S., Modes of Power in Technical and Professional Communication Studies in Technical Communication: Proceedings of the 1992 CCCC and NCTE Meetings, pp. 183-215. , Sims B.R., (ed), Lubbock, TX. : CCCC and NCTE Committees on Technical Communication, and, Edited by; Beck, C.E., Wegner, K., Toward a Rhetoric of Technical Proposals: Ethos and Audience Analysis (1992) Technical Communication, 39, pp. 122-126; Butler, D.R., The Function of Metaphor in Technical Discourse (1986) Journal of Technical Writing and Communication, 16, pp. 141-146; Childs, J.S., Where Techne Meets Poesis: Some Semiotic Considerations in the Rhetoric of Technical Discourse (1986) Journal of Technical Writing and Communication, 16, pp. 63-72; Connatser, B.R., Setting the Context for Understanding (1994) Technical Communication, 41, pp. 287-291; Corbett, E.P.J., A Rhetorician Looks at Technical Communication (1981) Technical Communication: Perspectives for the Eighties, pp. 213-218. , Mathes J.C., Pinelli T.E., (eds), Hampton, VA: NASA,.

This essay traces these shifts in light of changes in writing research, psychology, and the rhetoric of science. In composition studies, an initial mild uneasiness about “scientism”; intensified with the rise of process models, suggesting a Romanticist defense of the mystique of creativity. More recent post-modernist denunciations of scientific methods as immoral have other Romanticist overtones. In technical communication, a long-standing interest in workplace writing practices allowed a smoother integration of empirical analysis with descriptive studies of writing contexts. However, as in composition, recent critiques in technical communication suggest that empirical methods should not be employed. These critiques too tightly circumscribe the values that may be considered humanist and cut off important avenues of inquiry and critique that historically have advanced both the sciences and humanities. © 1998, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Anderson, J., Reder, L., Simon, H., Situated Learning and Education (1996) Educational Researcher, 25 (4), pp. 5-11; Anderson, P., The Need for Better Research in Technical Communication (1980) Journal of Technical Writing and Communication, 10, pp. 271-282; Barton, E., Evocative Gestures in CCCC Chairs’ Addresses (1996) Watson Conference on Rhetoric and Composition, , Oct.101996, Louisville, KY; Beach, R., Bridwell, L., (1984) New Directions in Composition Research, , New York: Guilford, and, eds; Bereiter, C., Scardamalia, M., (1987) The Psychology of Written Composition, , Hillsdale, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum; Berkenkotter, C., The Legacy of Positivism in Empirical Composition Research (1989) Journal of Advanced Composition, 9, pp. 69-82; Berlin, J., Rhetoric and Ideology in the Writing Class (1988) College English, 50, pp. 477-494; Bizzell, P., Cognition, Convention, and Certainty: What We Need to Know About Writing (1982) Pre/Text, 3, pp. 213-243; Thomas Kuhn, Scientism, and English Studies (1979) College English, 40, pp. 764-771; Blyler, N., Research as Ideology in Professional Communication (1995) Technical Communication Quarterly, 4, pp. 285-313; Braddock, R., Lloyd-Jones, R., Schoer, L., (1963) Research in Written Composition, , Champaign, IL: NCTE; Burton, D., Research in the Teaching of English: The Troubled Dream (1973) Research in the Teaching of English, 7, pp. 160-189; Charney, D., Empiricism is Not a Four-Letter Word (1996) College Composition and Communication, 47, pp. 567-593; Paradigm and Punish (1997) College Composition and Communication, 48, pp. 562-565; A Study in Rhetorical Reading: How Evolutionists Read ‘The Spandrels of San Marco.’ (1993) Understanding Scientific Prose, pp. 203-231. , Seher J., (ed), Madison: U of Wisconsin P,.

A major role in the exchange is played by Information Coordinators—physicians, nurses, or administrators in the partnership institutions in the region. Through a questionnaire distributed during a training session in the U.S. and e‐mail exchanges, we interviewed these Information Coordinators to learn how Internet technologies are being introduced, disseminated, and adopted in their institutions. We then applied Everett Rogers's theory of the diffusion of innovations to help interpret their responses. Although now only in its preliminary stages, this study shows that technical communicators must be aware of the cultural influences—economic, political, ethnic, and institutional—that accompany technology as they communicate about such innovations across borders of culture, expertise, and ideology. © 1998, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Austin, J.L., (1975) How To Do ThingsWithWords., , 2nd ed., Cambridge, MA: Harvard UP; Corbett, J., From Dialog to Praxis: Crossing Cultural Borders in the Business and Technical Communication Classroom (1995) Technical Communication Quarterly, 5, pp. 411-424",,,,,,,,,10572252,,,,"English","Tech.

These women writers provide a microcosm for studying the rise of modern English prose and what we now call technical (or plain) style. They also provide an efficient way to expose students to early published works by women and their contribution to the history of technical writing. Examining style from such a perspective helps students see that technical communication was a prevalent kind of writing before Bacon and the Royal Society. Thus, technical communication—and the style of technical communication—studied from this unique historical perspective deepens students’ awareness of the roots of technical communication as it contributed to the history of English discourse. © 1998, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Adolph, R., (1968) The Rise of Modern Prose Style, , Cambridge, MA: MIT P; Arakelian, P., The Myth of a Restoration Style Shift (1979) The Eighteenth Century: Theory and Interpretation, 20, pp. 227-245; Bacon, F., (1937) Essays, the Advancement of Learning, the New Atlantis, and Other Pieces, , Jones R.F., (ed), New York: Odyssey, Edited by; Baugh, A.C., (1957) A History of the English Language., , 2nd ed., Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice-Hall; Beilin, E.V., (1987) Redeeming Eve: Women Writers of the English Renaissance, , Princeton, NJ: Princeton; Browne, T., (1928) Works, 6. , Keynes G., (ed), London: Faher and Gwyer, Edited by; Bush, D., (1962) English Literature in the Earlier Seventeenth Century., , 2nd ed., New York: Cambridge UP; Chambers, R.W., (1932) On the Continuity of English Prose from Alfred to More and His School.

In the pilot, one third of the capstone design course students jointly enrolled in the writing class. One goal of the collaborative courses was to use writing to improve the usability of students’ software. We studied the effects of writing on students’ user‐centered beliefs and design practices and on the usability of their product, using surveys, document analyses, expert reviews, and user test results. When possible, we compared the usability processes and products of teams who did and did not take the writing class. Our findings suggest that the synergy of this interdisciplinary approach effectively sensitized students to user‐centered design, instilled in them a commitment to it, and helped them develop usable products. © 1998, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Agre, P., Conceptions of the User in Computer Systems Design (1995) The Social and Interactional Dimensions of Human‐Computer Interfaces, pp. 67-106. , Thomas P.J., (ed), Cambridge: Cambridge UP,.

Two experiments at Delft University of Technology support this conclusion. Subjects viewed videotapes of professional presentations on the topic of Sick Building Syndrome. In one experiment, subjects rated the effectiveness of three introductory or “exordial”; techniques in gaining audience attention: an anecdote, an ethical appeal, and a “your problem”; approach. Results indicate that audiences do respond to exordial techniques, and in a predictable manner. In the second experiment, two speeches with anecdotal openers were tested against one without any introduction. The anecdotes led to significantly higher ratings of the presentation's comprehensibility and interest, as well as the speaker's credibility. The presence of an anecdote also resulted in higher retention scores. Oddly enough, the relevance of the anecdote did not seem to make a difference in the ratings. © 1998, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Beason, L., Strategies for Establishing an Effective Persona: An Analysis of Appeals to Ethos in Business Speeches (1991) Journalof Business Communication, 28, pp. 326-346; Cicero, (1993) De Inventione, , Hubbell H.M., (ed), Cambridge, MA: Harvard UP, Edited by; Corbett, E.P.J., (1990) Classical Rhetoric for the Modem Student, , 3rd ed., New York: Oxford UP; Dempsey, R.H., Reinsch, N.L., Jr., (1982) “Arousal as a Confounding Variable: A Case Study in Credibility Research.”, , ERIC Document 219 825; Gruner, C.R., Speaker Ethos, Self‐Disparaging Humour, and Perceived Sense of Humour (1982) Annual Meeting of the International Conference on Humour, , 1982, Washington D.C. : [ERIC Document 220 879]; Harms, L.S., Listener Judgements of Status Cues in Speech (1961) QuarterlyJournal ofSpeech, 47, p. 168; Kurvers, S.R., (1994) Handleiding voor de aanpak van gebouwen werkplekgerelateerde Machten, , Den Haag: Sdu Uitgeverij; McCroskey, J.C., (1972) AnIntroduction to Rhetorical Communication., , 2nd ed., Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice‐Hall; McCroskey, J.C., Young, T.J., Ethos and Credibility: The Construct and Its Measurement after Three Decades (1981) Central States Speech Journal, 32, pp. 24-34; Osborn, M., Osborn, S., (1998) Public Speaking., , 3rd ed., Boston: Houghton Mifflin; Spek, E.V.D., (1995) DeEerste Klap, 20 Beproefde Technieken, , Alphen a/d Rÿn: Samson/Nive; Verderber, R.F., (1994) The Challenge of Effective Speaking., , 9th ed., Belmont, CA: Wadsworth",,,,,,,,,10572252,,,,"English","Tech.

The “failure”; of these risk communication models has led, some scholars argue, to a number of ethical and communicative problems. We seek to extend the critique, arguing that “risk”; is socially constructed. The claim for the social construction of risk has significant implications for both risk communication and the roles of technical communicators in risk situations. We frame these implications as a “critical rhetoric”; of risk communication that (1) dissolves the separation of risk assessment from risk communication to locate epistemology within communicative processes; (2) foregrounds power in risk communication as a way to frame ethical audience involvement; (3) argues for the technical communicator as one possessing the research and writing skills necessary for the complex processes of constructing and communicating risk. © 1998, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"(1995) United States Code, 9617. , Section; Adams, W.C., The Role of Media Relations in Risk Communication (1992) Public Relations Quarterly, 37 (4), pp. 28-31; Belsten, L., Environmental Risk Communication and Community Collaboration (1996) Earthtalk, pp. 27-42. , Muir S., Veenendall T., (eds), Westport, CT: Praeger,.

Technical communicators, however, have an obligation to exercise patience as they enter this arena of study. Using interdisciplinary theory, this article argues that technical communication must assume the “burden of comprehension”;: the responsibility of understanding the ideologies, contexts, values, and histories of those disciplines from which we borrow before we begin using their methods and research findings. Three disciplines of technology study—history, sociology, and philosophy—are examined to investigate how these disciplines approach technology. The article concludes with speculation on how technical communicators, by virtue of their entrance into this interdisciplinary arena, might refashion both their practical roles and the scope of their ethical responsibilities. © 1998, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Bazerman, C., (1988) Shaping Written Knowledge: The Genre and Activity of the Experimental Article in Science, , Madison: Wisconsin UP; Bijker, W.E., Hughes, T.P., Pinch, T.J., (1987) The Social Construction of Technological Systems: New Directions in the Sociology and History of Technology, , Cambridge, MA: MIT P; Brown, J.S., Duguid, P., Borderline Issues: Social and Material Aspects of Design (1994) Human Computer Interaction, 9, pp. 3-36; Cockburn, C., (1985) Machinery of Dominance: Women, Men and Technical Know-How, , London: Pluto P; Cowan, R.S., (1984) More Work for Mother: Household Technologies from the Open Hearth to the Microwave, , New York: Basic Books; Doheny-Farina, S., (1992) Rhetoric, Innovation, Technology, , Cambridge, MA: MIT P; Ehn, P., (1988) Work-Oriented Design of Computer Artifacts, , Stockholm: Arbetslivscebtrum; Ellul, J., (1964) The Technological Society, , New York: Vintage Books; Floyd, C., Out of Scandinavia: Alternative Approaches to Software Design and Development (1989) Human Computer Interaction, 4, pp. 253-349; Haas, C., (1996) Writing Technology: Studies on the Materiality of Literacy, , Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum; Hacker, S., (1990) Doing It the Hard Way: Investigations of Gender and Technology, , Smith D., Turner S., (eds), Boston: Unwin Hyman, Edited by; Hagge, J., Ethics, Words, and the World in Moore's and Miller's Accounts of Scientific and Technical Discourse (1996) Journal of Business and Technical Communication, 10, pp. 461-475; Heidegger, M., (1962) The Question of Technology and Other Essays, , Lovitt W., (ed), San Franciso: Harper and Row, Edited by; Johnson, R.R., User-Centered Technology: A Rhetorical Theory of Computers and Other Mundane Artifacts, , Albany, NY: SUNY P, press; Klein, J.T., (1990) Interdisciplinarity, , Detroit: Wayne State UP; Latour, B., Where Are the Missing Masses?

Implications for objectivity and validity in speculative cultural study research are also explored. Finally, since articulation of a coherent theoretical foundation is crucial to limiting a cultural study, this article suggests how technical writing can be constituted as an object of study according to five (of many possible) poststructural concepts: the object of inquiry as discursive, the object as practice within a cultural context, the object as practice within a historical context, the object as ordered by language, and the object in relationship with the one who studies it. © 1998, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Aronowitz, S., (1988) Science as Power: Discourse and Ideology in Modern Society, , Minneapolis: U of Minnesota P; Barton, B.F., Barton, M.S., Ideology and the Map: Toward a Postmodern Visual Design Practice (1993) Professional Communication: The Social Perspective, pp. 49-78. , Blyler N.R., Thralls C., (eds), Newbury Park, CA: Sage, and,.

The critical perspective aims at empowerment and emancipation. It reinterprets the relationship between researcher and participants as one of collaboration, where participants define research questions that matter to them and where social action is the desired goal. Examples of critical research include feminist, radical educational, and participatory action research. Adopting the critical perspective would require that scholars in professional communication rethink their choices of research questions and sites, their views of the ownership of research results, and the types of funding they seek for research initiatives. © 1998, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Anderson, G.L., Irvine, P., Informing Critical Literacy with Ethnography (1993) Critical Literacy: Politics, Power, and the Postmodern, pp. 81-104. , Lankshear C., McLaren P.L., (eds), Albany, NY: SUNY P, and,.

To overcome such difficulties, technical companies may hire writing consultants, who then take on the additional role of cultural interpreters, helping the partners bridge differences in both the practice of engineering and the language and culture of each country. As such a writing consultant, I worked with a Canadian engineering company, its Russian contractors, and a Russian translator to analyze the sources of difficulties in their reports. The language of the reports was English, but differences in tone as well as reader expectations about organization, format, and appropriate content caused misunderstandings among the collaborators. Contrastive rhetorical analysis helped to identify problems in both the conception of the report as a document and the translation of particular text. © 1998, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Bakhtin, M.M., The Problem of Speech Genres (1986) Speech, Genres, and Other Late Essays, pp. 60-102. , McGee V.W., Emerson C., Holquist M., (eds), Austin: U of Texas P,.

Their research is interpreted in light of recent theory on authorship as a cultural rather than individual phenomenon. Students' constructs for understanding their own writerly selves are discussed, as are constructs that emerged for the interpretations of selves and others in workplace cultures. Teaching technical authorship meant addressing such constructs, implicating issues of status, affect and effect, representation, and expertise. © 1995, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

Cultural conventions inform language, often creating differences in the content, organizational pattern, presentation of argument, style, and format of business documents. Differences in conventions can lead to readers’ misinterpretation or failure to understand a message. International business communication is evolving along with the global economy in four distinct patterns: as a hybridized language, as a business interlanguage, as a multiconventional language, and as an international language. The present workforce and those about to enter it need to become sensitized to the effects of multicultural conventions on their business communication. © 1995, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

The article discusses the ideologies of two research perspectives: a functionalist perspective, common in much social scientific research, and a critical interpretive perspective, currently emerging in disciplines other than our own. The article sets recent discussions of research in professional communication within a functionalist framework, then posits that a critical interpretive ideology provides an alternative. The interests advanced by both perspectives are discussed, and the viability of critical interpretive research in professional communication is supported. © 1995, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

Socially oriented semiotic theories offer models of how language works symbolically in this way. A productive means of introducing these is to have students evaluate advertisements as forms of technical and professional writing. This study uses central ideas from Roland Barthes's essays on connotative semiotics as a rationale for directing writers to develop the critical reflex to analyze and then make judgments about the values implied by connotative systems. © 1995, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

These developments deflate some traditional assumptions about and privileges associated with scientific and technical knowledge and practice, while they elevate previously denied aspects.

As a result, unions, agencies, and operators engage in fiercely contested public debates over responsibility and authority when disasters occur. In proposing a three-dimensional model of accident analysis (both visual and verbal), this article illustrates how underlying models of causality influence the structure of technical reports and the nature of the argument over responsibility and authority in largescale technological disasters. © 1994, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

The sales model underpinning traditional business communication principles does not consider the effect of such power in memos written by managers to subordinates. Three rhetorical and linguistic strategies that reflect the construct of power in managerial communication are projecting leadership, assuming commonality, and controlling information. These strategies, which have not been sufficiently considered in theoretical and applied research, suggest the need to consider new ways of articulating principles for management communication. © 1994, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

Often, what documentation exists consists mainly of long lists of cases exemplifying the trend, or detailed descriptions of a small number of salient cases. Here, it is argued that although these lists and salient cases are not good evidence that a trend is pervasive, they may convince both the trend researcher and his or her audience. The possibility is raised that the bias may be pervasive in science and everyday thought, and a strategy for avoiding it, namely the use of random samples, is offered. © 1994, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

After analyzing a selected sample of women's scholarship in technical communication journal articles, the study explores whether traditional authoritative writing features conflict with traits more frequently characterized in feminist research as “women's ways of making meaning.” Findings point to a need for more research into how scholarly writers develop a voice of authority; such research may challenge how we define and teach scholarly writing in technical communication. © 1994, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

Arguing that feminist scholarship is a relevant and powerful means of understanding these situations, we position the five contributions to this special issue within theoretical frameworks that explore interconnections of gender with methods and practices in technical and professional communication. After outlining areas for future research, we raise the question of men's relation to gender research and feminism, calling for more scholarship that engages a wider spectrum of feminist thought. © 1994, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

To gain insight into achieving such purposes, rhetoricians can learn from theories in the social science subdisciplines of risk perception and communication. Theorists in these fields identify various psychological, social, political, and cultural dynamics that risk communicators must address in order to generate new processes of debate. I apply many of these theoretical principles to a sample risk communication on nuclear energy to determine realistic expectations for persuasive risk communications. My conclusions stress that rhetorical researchers need to explore and test the extent to which written rhetorical forms can facilitate consensus. © 1994, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

However, our students may not know how to wield this power with full awareness of its ethical implications. They may not understand that they have considerable control over how a reader perceives the writer, the message, or the context of the message. Learning how to use language and information ethically should be the focus of discussions of language choices and presentation of information in technical communication classrooms. By studying the power of communication to affect values and judgements, our students will realize the fundamental ethical responsibilities they bear as writers. This essay discusses current research on ethics and technical communication, examines specific methods that writers may use to manipulate language and to present information unethically, and suggests questions designed to teach students how to analyze situations that may involve such manipulation and misrepresentation. The essay closes with two case studies to illustrate such situations. © 1993, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

The result is a range of socially based pedagogies rather than a single paradigm for writing instruction. This essay describes four of these social pedagogies—the social constructionist, the ideologic, the social cognitive, and the paralogic hermeneutic—distinguishing them by their pedagogic aims and classroom practices. The essay closes by discussing the implications of the differences among socially based pedagogies for both teachers and programs in technical communication. © 1993, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

This movement, which Aydelotte first articulated while directing Indiana University's first-year English program, modified for universities in the United States the education that he had received at Oxford University as a Rhodes Scholar. Rather than emphasizing matters of form and correctness, the thought approach required engineering students to think and write about issues important to their education and future careers. © 1993, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

Yet, knowledge of the rhetorical processes and social dimensions characterizing this type of collaboration remains scant and inadequate. This essay takes the stance that if rhetoricians hope to make significant strides forward in understanding writing that takes place both within and external to a single workplace culture, they will need to develop a much more expansive, complex, and sophisticated vision of collaboration across multiple organizational cultures. It suggests how, to accomplish this goal, rhetoricians might build on the strengths and overcome the limitations of past scholarship in organizational and related studies and in rhetoric, and it introduces new directions these scholars might take and new questions they might explore in future investigations in this area of inquiry. © 1993, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

To examine this relationship, the authors observed four proposal developers (two males and two females) as they collaborated with several groups at Southwestern Bell Telephone company. The authors examined preconceptions about three factors: effective and ineffective collaboration, gender's effect on collaboration, and gender's effect on persuasion. They also examined persuasion techniques used by the proposal developers. © 1993, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

A course in desktop publishing can provide students at rural schools with experience equivalent to internships. In the desktop publishing course I taught at Murray State University, in addition to learning principles of layout and design, students faced many challenges like those that will confront them in the workplace. They worked on projects that entailed real financial constraints and deadlines; they were required to modify their work after receiving reviews from several different individuals. In addition to providing students with experience, the course provided benefits to the university in terms of services and public relations. © 1992, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

In this view, knowledge, reality, and even facts are community generated, “linguistic entities,” and hypertext supports the “social interface” rather than the “deep structure” of thought. This essay Considers some of the premises of Barrett's proposal. A central issue is the rejection of the “authorial imperative” of structured information in favor of a view of writing as an Open-ended ever-changing conversation in which readers and writers collaborate to discover—or generate—reality. © 1992, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

Because English classrooms do not encourage transaction, they are not the best places to teach technical writing. However, four maxims bring the spirit of transaction to our teaching. © 1992, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

In order to discover the ways in which social and organizational factors affect users’ tasks and their acquisition of knowledge and skills, I conducted a survey of 25 people who use databases at work. All survey respondents use database programs as tools for conducting job tasks that involve complex analyses and reporting of data. I examined the relationship between people's technical proficiency and task complexity and their job roles, professional responsibilities, flexibility in work arrangements and modes of workplace learning. Findings show that learning to use databases for complex tasks in work contexts entails more than merely learning concepts and procedures for executing program functions. Users need to learn ways of manipulating a program, integrating and combining its functions in inventive ways to serve the purposes of various types of job tasks and to support professional approaches to these tasks. © 1992, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

Such rationales, however, are unable to accommodate a notion of ethics and responsibility: if the writer merely serves the interests that employ her by reporting facts in an objective way, how can she exercise choice when ethical problems arise? An alternative view is to see technical writing as always rhetorical and involved with potentially conflicting agendas and interests, with objectivity, clarity, and neutrality serving merely as stylistic devices in the writer's rhetorical toolbox. Technical writers are rhetoricians who continually make ethical choices in serving diverse interests and negotiating between conflicting demands. The recognition of the fundamental rhetoricity of technical writing is the first step towards accommodating a meaningful notion of ethics into the technical writing curriculum. © 1992, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

The article describes social, political, economic, and legal changes in the professions during the last 30 years and the growing influence of market-driven decisions on ethical decision-making. It briefly surveys the marketing literature that engineering marketers are reading. Finally, it suggests a question that marketing writers should ask themselves in examining rhetorical choices. © 1992, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

When teachers (like editors) see their primary task as judges or gatekeepers, they can become engaged in adversarial relationships that contradict their role as enablers/teachers. The author's editor, on the other hand, is an emerging model of the editor-author relationship that focuses on helping authors meet the expectations of gatekeeping journal and book editors. Teachers can use the author's-editor model in the professional writing classroom to minimize the current-traditional emphasis on the product and emphasize the collaborative nature of the writing process. © 1992, (publisher).

This article examines narration in one form of professional communication—direct solicitations—and links narration to an important research issue: the social construction of knowledge, or the social justification of belief, through language. The direct solicitations are described, and the role of narration in justifying belief socially, for direct solicitations, is then discussed by examining narration and analysis as two means for organizing and expressing experience. The interweaving of these two means in direct solicitations is illustrated, but finally the importance of the narrational over the analytic in giving shape and significance to experience is asserted. Thus, the central role narratives play in justifying belief socially, for direct solicitations is described. Three sample narratives from three direct solicitations illustrate this discussion. © 1992, (publisher). All rights reserved.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Animal Rescue League.

These instances are the “anomalous” charring of the O-rings and the reconceptualized assumption of flightworthiness the night before the launch. The social contingency of these meanings shows that the “object” of technical communication is not the material object as a pre-existent isolate but in its social interpretation, significance, and meaning. Ultimately, technical communication is about people communicating about and to the interests of other people. © 1992, (publisher).

With today's diversifying readerships and increasingly global marketplace, business and industry face a new challenge that is reshaping our conception of business/technical writing and the metaphors of the genre. The metaphors of “selling” and “reader-centeredness” demand especially to be recast and subordinated to a new metaphor of interculturalism/ internationalism—“ourselves among others.” Grounded in a social theory of language and communication, this new metaphor signifies that “bridge-building” across differences will be the key in contexts becoming at once more heterogeneous and global. © 1992, (publisher).
