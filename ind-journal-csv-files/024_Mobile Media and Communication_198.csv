However, little attention has been given to the effect of mobile communication on perceived security on public transport. This paper develops a model of social presence and perceived security in order to understand the widespread use of mobile phones on public transport as well as its effects. The first part of the model suggests a mediating role of social presence to understand how perceived security motivates mobile communication. The respective hypotheses are tested with a representative survey (N = 2,267), and the results support the mediating role of social presence. The second part of the model assumes that social presence is not only a motive to use mobile communication but also helps to improve perceived security. Based on a 2-week mobile experience sampling with 86 participants and 1,264 measurement points, the effect of mobile communication and social presence obtained, as well as individual and situational factors on perceived security were tested. The respective hypotheses were partially supported but also suggest that other coping strategies might be of relevance to fully understand the relationship between mobile communication and situational perceived security. Besides the academic insights, these results suggest that public transport operators should consider expanding mobile phone coverage in their vehicles and stations to improve perceived security and make their services more attractive. © The Author(s) 2019.","mobile communication; perceived security; public transport; social presence; uses and gratifications",,,,,,"Eidgenössischen Departement für Wirtschaft, Bildung und Forschung, WBF: https://doi.org/10.13039/501100002347","https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8483-2247 Reichow Dennis University of Bremen, Germany Friemel Thomas N.

In general, phubbing can negatively affect interpersonal relationships and well-being. When younger family members’ phubbing behavior is perceived by older adult relatives as a violation of their conversational expectations, these older adults may feel ignored and disrespected. This study may be the first to investigate the associations between intergenerational family phubbing expectancy violations and indicators of well-being among older adults. Survey data were derived from a sample of U.S. Internet users aged 65 or above (n = 679). The results suggested that both perceived frequency of family phubbing and family phubbing expectancy violations were inversely associated with mattering and indicators of well-being. Study limitations and potential directions for future research are discussed. © The Author(s) 2019.","expectancy violations; mobile phones; older adults; phubbing; well-being",,,,,,,,,"Anderson, M., Perrin, A., (2017) Tech adoption climbs among older adults, , https://www.pewinternet.org/2017/05/17/technology-use-among-seniors/, Retrieved from; Ball, C., Francis, J., Huang, K.T., Kadylak, T., Cotten, S.R., Rikard, R.V., The physical–digital divide: Exploring the social gap between digital natives and physical natives (2017) Journal of Applied Gerontology, 38 (8), pp. 1167-1184; Bayer, J.B., Campbell, S.W., Ling, R., Connection cues: Activating the norms and habits of social connectedness (2016) Communication Theory, 26, pp. 128-149; Bayer, J.B., Dal Cin, S., Campbell, S.W., Panek, E., Consciousness and self-regulation in mobile communication (2016) Human Communication Research, 42 (1), pp. 71-97; Birnholtz, J., Davison, J., Li, A., Attending to attention: How do people attract, manage, and negotiate attention using mobile devices?

Faced with the challenge from streaming music, many broadcast radio stations have launched their own mobile apps to compete with the new audio services such as Spotify. Guided by the uses and gratifications conceptual framework, this study employed a national survey to investigate millennials’ perceptions of the substitutability and complementarity of broadcast radio, its apps, and music streaming services. The results showed that while radio listeners perceived broadcast radio and its apps as similar products, they regarded music streaming services as distinct from the two. In addition, this study examined motivators behind the diverse perceptions and identified information, escapism, entertainment, and socialization as important. The results suggest that radio stations should take advantage of the mobile technology and offer unique values through their apps, rather than duplicate the offline consumption experience. © The Author(s) 2019.","audio media; millennial; mobile apps; music streaming services; radio; U&G",,,,,,,,,"Albarran, A.B., Anderson, T., Bejar, L.G., Bussart, A.L., Daggett, E., Gibson, S., Way, H., What happened to our audience?” Radio and new technology uses and gratifications among young adult users (2007) Journal of Radio Studies, 14 (2), pp. 92-101; Alnawas, I., Aburub, F., The effect of benefits generated from interacting with branded mobile apps on consumer satisfaction and purchase intentions (2016) Journal of Retailing and Consumer Services, 31, pp. 313-322; Augenstein, N., (2015) Broadcasters are missing a huge mobile opportunity: Engagement in apps, , http://mediashift.org/2015/01/broadcasters-are-missing-huge-mobile-opportunity-engagement-in-apps/, Retrieved from; Belcher, J.D., Haridakis, P., The role of background characteristics, music-listening motives, and music selection on music discussion (2013) Communication Quarterly, 61 (4), pp. 375-396; Bentley, J.M., A uses and gratifications study of contemporary Christian radio web sites (2012) Journal of Radio & Audio Media, 19 (1), pp. 2-16; Bondad-Brown, B.A., Rice, R.E., Pearce, K.E., Influences on TV viewing and online user-shared video use: Demographics, generations, contextual age, media use, motivations, and audience activity (2012) Journal of Broadcasting & Electronic Media, 56 (4), pp. 471-493; Cataldo, J.K., High-risk older smokers’ perceptions, attitudes, and beliefs about lung cancer screening (2016) Cancer Medicine, 5 (4), pp. 753-759; Cha, J., Chan-Olmsted, S.M., Substitutability between online video platforms and television (2012) Journalism & Mass Communication Quarterly, 89 (2), pp. 261-278; Colapinto, C., Manzi, G., Music listening in the twenty-first century: Italian consumer attitudes to Internet radio (2016) Radio Journal: International Studies in Broadcast & Audio Media, 14 (2), pp. 213-229; Deahl, D., (2019) People are complaining that Spotify’s new interface buries the repeat button, , https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/19/18230222/spotifys-new-interface-repeat-button-user-complaint, Retrieved from; Dimmick, J., Kline, S., Stafford, L., The gratification niches of personal e-mail and the telephone: Competition, displacement, and complementarity (2000) Communication Research, 27 (2), pp. 227-248; Dutta-Bergman, M.J., Complementarity in consumption of news types across traditional and new media (2004) Journal of Broadcasting & Electronic Media, 48 (1), pp. 41-60; Ferguson, D.A., Greer, C.F., Reardon, M.E., Uses and gratifications of MP3 players by college students: Are iPods more popular than radio?

This is one of the core questions in media and communication studies, gaining even more in relevance in light of the rapidly changing, convergent media environment. Yet, rich and context-sensitive data about media and technology use are difficult to generate when media consumption is increasingly pervasive, ubiquitous, and often goes on in passing. At the same time, the full potential of smartphones in qualitative research has not yet been realized. The mobile instant messaging interview (MIMI) introduced and assessed in this paper is intended to fill this gap by exploiting some of the unique communication and multimedia features offered by mobile instant messaging apps. Drawing on diary techniques and on the tried and tested mobile experience sampling method (MESM), the MIMI uses WhatsApp for an in situ exploration of distinct settings and situations of social action (e.g., media usage). To substantiate the approach, the results of a pilot study conducted with young smartphone users are presented, discussing the advantages and drawbacks of mobile instant messaging interviews in detail, from the researcher’s as well as the participant’s point of view. © The Author(s) 2019.","cell phone app; data collection; diary method; ethnography; instant messaging; mobile experience sampling; mobile messaging; mobile method; qualitative research; smartphone",,,,,,"UniversitÃ¤t Salzburg","The authors would like to thank the Open Access Publication Fund of the University of Salzburg for their financial support and the anonymous reviewers for their most helpful comments.",,"Alaszewski, A., (2006) Using diaries for social research, , London, UK, SAGE; Ang, I., (1996) Living room wars: Rethinking media audiences for a postmodern world, , Abingdon, UK, Routledge; Bartlett, R., Milligan, C., (2015) What is diary method?, , London, UK, Bloomsbury Academic; Berg, M., Düvel, C., Qualitative media diaries: An instrument for doing research from a mobile media ethnographic perspective (2012) Interactions: Studies in Communication & Culture, 3 (1), pp. 71-89; Boase, J., Implications of software-based mobile media for social research (2013) Mobile Media & Communication, 1 (1), pp. 57-62; Boase, J., Ling, R., Measuring mobile phone use: Self-report versus log data (2013) Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication, 18 (4), pp. 508-519; Bolger, N., Davis, A., Rafaeli, E., Diary methods: Capturing life as it is lived (2003) Annual Review of Psychology, 54 (1), pp. 579-616; Bouwman, H., de Reuver, M., Heerschap, N., Verkasalo, H., Opportunities and problems with automated data collection via smartphones (2013) Mobile Media & Communication, 1 (1), pp. 63-68; Brennen, B., (2017) Qualitative research methods for media studies, , London, UK, Routledge; Bytheway, B., (2012) The use of diaries in qualitative longitudinal research, , http://www.timescapes.leeds.ac.uk/assets/files/methods-guides/timescapes-bytheway-use-of-diaries.pdf, (Timescapes Methods Guides Series 2012, Guide No. 7).

At the same time, historians of information and communication technologies (ICTs) have amassed a large body of literature on the history of typewriters and their contribution to gendered office work. To date, however, these two strains have yet to converge. This article thus examines intersections between typewriting, gender, and mobility, focusing on the case of portable typewriters to investigate users’ “differential” mobilities before World War II in the United States. In this regard, it reconceives of typewriters as fluid historical objects defined significantly by their social contexts. It calls upon scholars to expand their characterizations of typing beyond thinking only of it as an immobile, desk-based practice and as “women’s work.” Instead, it draws attention to itinerant male typists as an early class of portable typewriter users who could (and were encouraged to) travel with a typewriter in tow. More broadly, the article also contributes to understandings of mobile media histories beyond mobile phones by demonstrating similar concerns related to portability, usability, and ergonomics in the early 20th century. © The Author(s) 2019.","gender; portable; space; typewriter; work",,,,,,,,,"Agar, J., (2013) Constant touch: A global history of the mobile phone, , London, UK, Icon Books; Albus, V., Kras, R., Woodham, J.M., (2000) Icons of design!: The 20th century, , Munich, Germany, Prestel; Alper, M., Portables, luggables, and transportables: Historicizing the imagined affordances of mobile computing (2018) Mobile Media & Communication, 7 (3), pp. 322-340; (1896) The Railway News, 66, p. 780; Bardini, T., (2000) Bootstrapping: Douglas Engelbart, coevolution, and the origins of personal computing, , Stanford, CA, Stanford University Press; Beniger, J.R., (1986) The control revolution: Technological and economic origins of the information society, , Cambridge, MA, Harvard University Press; Featherweight Typewriter: For military, naval, and service men [Advertisement] (1912) Royal United Service Institution Journal, 56, p. 148; Boyer, K., Miss Remington” goes to work: Gender, space, and technology at the dawn of the information age (2004) The Professional Geographer, 56 (2), pp. 201-212; Boykin, E.M., Efficient house is operated from desk (1941) The Washington Post, p. 13. , April, 17, (,)., p; Brown, L.G.B., (1934) Social psychology: The natural history of human nature, , New York, NY, McGraw-Hill; Burton, R., (1898) Men of progress: Biographical sketches and portraits of leaders in business and professional life in and of the state of Connecticut, , Boston, MA, New England Magazine, (Ed; Campbell-Kelly, M., Aspray, W., (1996) Computer: A history of the information machine, , 1st ed., New York, NY, Basic Books; Ceruzzi, P.E., (2003) A history of modern computing, , Cambridge, MA, The MIT Press; Cohn, D.L., (1940) The good old days: A history of American morals and manners as seen through the Sears Roebuck catalogs, , New York, NY, Simon & Schuster; Corona: The international typewriter for personal use [Advertisement] (1914) The Independent, 80, p. 40. , (, a; Way up in the clouds [Advertisement] (1914) Popular Mechanics, p. 163. , September, (, b; Corona folding typewriter [Advertisement] (1915) Popular Mechanics, p. 182. , November, (, a; This typewriter [Advertisement] (1915) The Independent, 84, p. 112. , October, 18, (, b; Corona Folding Typewriter: An office in your grip [Advertisement] (1915) The American Review of Reviews, 51, p. 49. , (, c; In the field or at home [Advertisement] (1916) National Geographic Magazine, 28, p. 196; How Corona has added to my income [Advertisement] (1922) Popular Mechanics, 37 (3), p. 119. , March; Corona – The only portable with all these big machine features [Advertisement] (1926) Popular Mechanics Magazine, p. 185. , February; Cortada, J.W., (1993) Before the computer: IBM, NCR, Burroughs, and Remington Rand and the industry they created, 1865–1956, , Princeton, NJ, Princeton University Press; Cowan, R.S., (1983) More work for mother: The ironies of household technology from the open hearth to the microwave, , New York, NY, Basic Books; Cresswell, T., (2006) On the move: Mobility in the modern Western world, , New York, NY, Taylor & Francis; Cresswell, T., Uteng, T.P., Gendered mobilities: Towards an holistic understanding (2008) Gendered mobilities, pp. 1-12. , Uteng T.P., Cresswell T., (eds), Aldershot, UK, Ashgate, (Eds.), (., –; Crussell, E.H., A portable typewriter stool for the yard or porch (1919) Popular Science, 94, p. 106. , April; Davies, M.W., (1982) Woman’s place is at the typewriter: Office work and office workers, 1870–1930, , Philadelphia, PA, Temple University Press; De Maeyer, J., Digital journalism in the cut-and-paste era (2018) Mondes Sociaux, , https://sms.hypotheses.org/9407, December, 19, (,)., Retrieved from; Duxbury, L., Smart, R., The myth of “separate worlds”: An exploration of how mobile technology has redefined work–life balance (2011) Creating balance?

Accordingly, this study aims to develop a more nuanced understanding of the impact of mobile device use on the quality of parent–child interaction in early childhood, based on ethnographic observations of 60 families at two playgrounds in the United States. The research findings suggest that parental behavior can be classified along a continuum of high engagement, divided engagement, and disengagement, often dependent upon whether and how parents use their mobile phone. Though mobile phones were not the only distracting factor during playground visits, their use was more highly correlated with parents’ disengagement from their children as compared to other distractors. Parents’ mobile phone use also corresponded to two main consequences for their children: safety concerns and emotional concerns, both resulting in missed opportunities for social learning. The results of this study call for closer attention to parental uses of mobile phones in public spaces. © The Author(s) 2019.","children; emotional availability; engagement; interaction; mobile media; parents; playgrounds; technoference",,,,,,"United States-Israel Binational Science Foundation, BSF

Guided by established research on smartphones, social media, and affordances, we used a qualitative approach and conducted field interviews that included photo-elicitation interview (PEI) techniques to examine participants’ private social media data. Our analysis of these rescue decisions reveals why so few people used the official 9-1-1 system. We show how rescue communication often occurs through a socially constructed assessment of risk that involves persuasion by trusted others in their network, regardless of professional qualifications. Furthermore, trusted others can function as proxies and can draw upon mobile social network affordances, helping to compensate for material limitations. The affordances people drew from can be organized into two sets: foundational and amplification. Hierarchical relationships exist among these sets of affordances, and materiality plays a pivotal role in rescue communication. Ultimately, our analysis uncovers the multimodality around people’s decisions to ask for help. © The Author(s) 2019.","affordances; disaster; materiality; mobile devices; rescue communication; risk; social construction; social media",,,,,,"National Science Foundation, NSF: 9-1-1, 1760453","We thank the many volunteer rescuers and rescuees of the Hurricane Harvey flooding for participating in this research.

The prevalence of certain topics, such as those related to gacha game mechanics, declined as community members mastered the practice and as the practice itself changed.

Drawing upon semi-structured interviews with 21 users who used Moments for at least 6 months, then voluntarily discontinued their use of the feature, we discuss the complex dynamics of Moments use, exploring the implicit micro-behavioral process of social media practice. Countering the purported hyper-centrality of WeChat, we identified a periodic loop of “use, non-use, reuse” of Moments, suggesting that people suspend their use of Moments periodically to “re-domesticate” technology. Through the prism of the domestication approach, we argue that the re-domestication of Moments is a “reboot” of the whole process of domestication through four key stages: re-appropriation, re-objectification, re-incorporation, and re-conversion. Re-domestication is a process that allows people to take a retrospective look at their lives and transform Moments from a disruptive app feature into an instrumental apparatus conducive to their personal and professional well-being. By examining this process, we discuss how people use innovative ways to regain their autonomy and agency in their daily interactions with WeChat. © The Author(s) 2020.","Domestication; Moments; non-use; re-domestication; social media; WeChat",,,,,,,,,"Abeele, M.V., De Wolf, R., Ling, R., Mobile media and social space: How anytime, anyplace connectivity structures everyday life (2018) Media and Communication, 6 (2), pp. 5-14; Barbalet, J., Guanxi, tie strength, and network attributes (2015) American Behavioral Scientist, 59 (8), pp. 1038-1050; Baumer, E., Adams, P., Khovanskaya, V., Liao, T., Smith, M., Schwanda Sosik, V., Williams, K., (2013) Limiting, leaving, and (re)lapsing: an exploration of facebook non-use practices and experiences, , https://doi.org/10.1145/2470654.2466446, Paper presented at the human factors computing systems; Baumer, E., Burrell, J., Ames, M., Brubaker, J., Dourish, P., On the importance and implications of studying technology non-use (2015) Interactions, 22 (2), pp. 52-56. , (, a; Baumer, E., Guha, S., Quan, E., Mimno, D., Gay, G.K., Missing photos, suffering withdrawal, or finding freedom?

The current study examined how self-reported smartphone use and smartphone dependency were associated with romantic partner communication, and how these variables subsequently tied to relationship satisfaction. Working with a sample of 433 American young adults in romantic relationships, the study found that smartphone use was associated with increased communication between romantic partners, and increased mediated communication between partners predicted more affectionate communication. Conversely, increased smartphone dependency was directly associated with less affectionate communication and lower relationship satisfaction. The study offers insights into how smartphones potentially affect how we connect with romantic partners. © The Author(s) 2020.","affectionate communication; interpersonal communication; romantic relationships; smartphone dependency; smartphone use",,,,,,,,,"Alderman, L., The phones we love too much (2017) New York Times, , May; Alhassan, A.A., Alqadhib, E.M., Taha, N.W., Alahmari, R.A., Salam, M., Almutairi, A.F., The relationship between addiction to smartphone usage and depression among adults: A cross sectional study (2018) BMC Psychiatry, 18 (1), pp. 1-9. , https://doi.org/10.1186/s12888-018-1745-4; Andrews, S., Ellis, D.A., Shaw, H., Piwek, L., Beyond self-report: Tools to compare estimated and real-world smartphone use (2015) PLoS ONE, 10 (10). , https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0139004; Barnes, F., Quantity time (1993) The New Republic, p. 209. , July; Baron, N.S., Concerns about mobile phones: A cross-national study (2011) First Monday, 16 (8). , https://doi.org/10.5210/fm.v16i8.3335; Bell, R.A., Healey, J.G., Idiomatic communication and interpersonal solidarity in friends’ relational cultures (1992) Human Communication Research, 18 (3), pp. 307-335. , https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1468-2958.1992.tb00555.x; Bian, M., Leung, L., Linking loneliness, shyness, smartphone addiction symptoms, and patterns of smartphone use to social capital (2015) Social Science Computer Review, 33 (1), pp. 61-79; Byrne, B.M., (1998) Structural equation modeling with LISREL, PRELIS, and SIMPLIS: Basic concepts, applications, and programming, , Lawrence Erlbaum Associates; Campbell, S.W., Mobile Communication and Network Privatism: A Literature Review of the Implications for Diverse, Weak, and New Ties (2015) Review of Communication Research, 3 (1), pp. 1-21. , https://doi.org/10.12840; Chan, L.S., Who uses dating apps?

Based on ethnographic research on personal shoppers’ mobile purchasing practices between mainland China and Hong Kong (HK), this article argues that mobile communication, as a social practice, extends relational places in cross-border shopping, on the one hand, and transforms the performances of mobilities that are used to anchor the spatial identities of shoppers and localities for consumption, on the other. Shoppers’ mobile communication practices create variable interactions between mobilities and places, manifested as mobile communicating place and place-inscribed communicative mobilities. The consumer cultures of HK personal shopping are anchored by the multiplicity of places and shifting mobilities of people, data, and objects. Mobile communication in/of HK is a medium through which people from the mainland can consume the symbolic space and “localness” of HK, embodying the “spatial selves” of personal shoppers through digital expressions of mobilities. Shoppers produce place-inscribed communicative mobilities of themselves and of commodities in HK through differing synchronization and coordination patterns in two places (Tsim Sha Tsui and Sheung Shui), based on the fact that the former is an international and local-brand tourist center and the latter has risen as a new “parallel trading hub” for cross-border consumption. © The Author(s) 2020.","consumer culture; cross-border shopping; mobile communication; mobility; place-making; space",,,,,,,,,"Adey, P., (2017) Mobility: Key ideas in geography, , London, UK, Routledge; Augé, M., (1995) Non-places: Introduction to an anthropology of supermodernity, , London, UK, Verso Books; Bork-Hüffer, T., Mediated sense of place: Effects of mediation and mobility on the place perception of German professionals in Singapore (2016) New Media and Society, 18 (10), pp. 2155-2170. , https://doi.org/10.1177/1461444816655611; Brembeck, H., Cochoy, F., Moisander, J., Moving consumption (2015) Consumption Markets and Culture, 18 (1), pp. 1-9. , https://doi.org/10.1080/10253866.2014.899218; Brembeck, H., Hansson, N., Lalanne, M., Vayre, J., (2015) Life phases, mobility and consumption: An ethnography of shopping routes, , London, UK, Routledge; Campbell, S., Mobile media and communication: A new field, or just a new journal?

It explores usage patterns and connectivity challenges, and how these affect access to social services as well as opportunities for information seeking, skills building, and social capital formation. To characterize the unreliable conditions under which this population uses mobile phones, we introduce the concept of access instability to capture not simply the obstacles to technology access imposed by poverty but more broadly those stemming from a combination of poverty, housing insecurity, and discrimination. The study is primarily based on a survey among adults experiencing homelessness (or at risk of) conducted over a span of 5 months, complemented by findings from a participatory research intervention carried out in collaboration with a local advocacy organization. Among the key findings is that reliable access to electrical power represents a fundamental yet understudied barrier to mobile use among marginalized populations, including (but not limited to) those experiencing homelessness. Lacking a safe and reliable place to charge their devices, the unstably housed must activate coping strategies that limit digital engagement and constrain use. Overall, access instability disrupts the expectation of constant reachability that underpins modern economic and social relations. Ultimately, this narrows pathways out of homelessness by limiting the ability to gain or sustain employment, to connect with healthcare providers and other vital resources, and to maintain networks of personal support. © The Author(s) 2020.","communication policy; digital inequality; homelessness; Los Angeles; mixed methods",,,,,,,,,"https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/DHS%20Study%20on%20Mobile%20Device%20Security%20-%20April%202017-FINAL.pdf, Department of Homeland Security (DHS) (2017).

Replicating an originally published field study from 2005, this study highlights how mobile phones and use have changed in the last 15 years and demonstrates the ways that mobile phones are used to both detract and enhance social interactions. Drawing on the notions of cellphone crosstalk and caller hegemony, we identify behavioral responses to mobile phones and the use of mobile phones by others, which help to manage both face-to-face and mediated social expectations of responsiveness. Based on observational fieldwork and interviews, we identify specific behavioral categories that demonstrate how social vulnerability and ostracism due to mobile phone use may be mitigated through parallel or collective mobile phone use. We also expand the original concepts of cellphone crosstalk and caller hegemony to mediated crosstalk and notification hegemony to account for contemporary changes in the sociotechnical mobile landscape. © The Author(s) 2020.","crosstalk; Dyads; field study; mobile phones; public space; replication",,,,,,,,,"Adler, P.A., Adler, P., Observational techniques (1994) Handbook of Qualitative Research, pp. 377-391. , N.

But when these data are stored and recorded—in quantities that far exceed any of our abilities to manage—mobile technology denies our ability to actively forget. This article argues that digital ephemerality via mobile applications (i.e. Snapchat, Signal, Confide, and Facebook Messenger Secret) has emerged because of the granular possibilities for data retention enabled by mobile devices. Together these applications move towards a practice of preventing data from being stored and shared. In response, “data prevention” is proposed as an ethical framework for ephemeral mobile media, and is theorized with an eye toward the distributed agency inherent to networks. This ethics is positioned within a framework of distributed agency across stakeholders that draws most directly from actor–network theory, and three commonly articulated values—trust, transparency, and privacy—are proposed. These values help to define a system of networked practices within ephemeral mobile media that requires consideration of both human and non-human actors. Building sustainable ephemeral technologies necessitates aligning shared values amongst divergent stakeholders. The article concludes by motioning to LIMITS research, where data prevention might be included, linking and further intensifying shared values across technical and social concerns. © The Author(s) 2020.","actor-network theory; data prevention; Ephemerality; mobile media; Snapchat; values",,,,,,,,,"Abbt, C., Forgetting in a digital glasshouse (2018) Remembering and forgetting in the digital age, pp. 124-134. , Thouvenin F., Hettich P., Burkert H., Gasser U., (eds), Springer, ( –; Adam, A., Ethics for things (2008) Ethics and Information Technology, 10, pp. 149-154. , https://doi.org/10.1007/s10676-008-9169-3; Albu, O., Flyverbom, M., Organizational transparency: Conceptualizations, conditions, and consequences (2016) Business & Society, 58 (2), pp. 268-297. , https://doi.org/10.1177/0007650316659851; Angwin, J., (2015) Dragnet Nation, , St. Martin’s Press; Ananny, M., Crawford, K., Seeing without knowing: Limitations of the transparency ideal and its application to algorithmic accountability (2018) New Media & Society, 20 (3), pp. 973-989. , https://doi.org/10.1177/1461444816676645; Bannon, L., Forgetting as “a feature, not a bug”: The duality of memory and implications for ubiquitous computing (2004) CoDesign, 1, pp. 3-15; Bayer, J., Ellison, N., Schoenebeck, S., Falk, E., Sharing the small moments: Ephemeral social interaction on Snapchat (2016) Information Communication and Society, 19 (7), pp. 956-977. , https://doi.org/10.1080/1369118X.2015.1084349; Bennett, J., (2010) Vibrant matter: A political ecology of things, , Duke University Press; Bossewitch, J., Sinnreich, A., The end of forgetting: Strategic agency beyond the panopticon (2012) New Media and Society, 15 (2), pp. 224-242; Boyd, D., Crawford, K., Critical questions for big data (2012) Information, Communication, and Society, 15 (5), pp. 662-679. , https://doi.org/10.1080/1369118X.2012.678878; Boyle, C., (2018) Rhetoric as a posthuman practice, , The Ohio State University Press; Brin, D., (1998) The transparent society, , Perseus Books; Chen, K., Cheung, H., Unlocking the power of ephemeral content: The roles of motivations, gratification, need for closure, and engagement (2019) Computers in Human Behavior, 97, pp. 67-74; Chun, W., The enduring ephemeral, or the future is a memory (2008) Critical Inquiry, 35 (1), pp. 148-171. , https://doi.org/10.1086/595632; Chun, W., Friedland, S., Habits of leaking: Of sluts and network cards (2015) Differences, 26 (2), pp. 1-28; Chun, W., (2016) Updating to remain the same: Habitual new media, , MIT Press; Conway, P., Preservation in the age of Google: Digitization, digital preservation, and dilemmas (2010) The Library Quarterly: Information, Community, Policy, 80 (1); Durham-Peters, J., (2015) The marvelous clouds: Towards a philosophy of elemental media, , University of Chicago Press; Eichhorn, K., (2019) The End of Forgetting, , Harvard University Press; Esposito, E., Algorithmic memory and the right to be forgotten on the web (2017) Big Data and Society, 4 (1), pp. 1-11. , https://doi.org/10.1177/2053951717703996; Faklaris, C., Hook, S., Oh snap!

This experiment uses video vignettes to test how manager policy (no policy, pro-technology, anti-technology), device use (notepad, laptop, cell phone) and task-acknowledgment (no task-acknowledgment, task-acknowledgment) affect perceptions of meeting multicommunication behavior. US workers (N = 243) who worked at least 30 hours per week and attended at least one weekly meeting rated relevant outcomes: expectancy violation, communicator evaluation, perceived competence, and meeting effectiveness. Results reveal manager policy and device use both affect multicommunication perceptions, with mobile phones generating the highest expectancy violation and lowest evaluation of the communicator and meeting effectiveness. Surprisingly, there was no effect for task-acknowledgment; however, a match between manager policy and task-acknowledgment affected evaluations. This paper unifies past evidence about multicommunication under the expectancy violations framework, extends theoretical understandings of mobile media use at work, and suggests practical implications for technology use in unfamiliar workplace situations. © The Author(s) 2020.","expectancy violations theory;

Accompanying the spike in Indian youths’ smartphone use is a proliferation of media coverage on the purported impact of smartphones on youths’ physical, psychological, and social well-being. We use a qualitative media analysis to show that the online and print media narratives around this issue reveal widespread fear and anxiety about youths’ smartphone use. We argue that this stems from a moral panic reaction to youths’, particularly young women’s, potential exercise of agency using their smartphones and accessing forbidden content over the internet. This narrative fails to include the potential affordances of internet access for youth and other marginalized people while also failing to address deeper concerns about digitization. © The Author(s) 2020.","gender; India; moral panic; online risk; smartphones; youth",,,,,,,,,"(2017), http://www.afternoonvoice.com/beware-smartphones-uses-raising-mental-disorder.html, (, 10 January).

Invoking Senft’s concept of the “micro-celebrity,” we discuss how live-streaming works in the app and assert that performers can earn money and derive emotional satisfaction from their work.

However, it has not been studied how Instagram use frequency is associated with depression, anxiety, and PSU. The aim of this study was to investigate whether Instagram use frequency is related to these psychopathology variables. Three hundred and five active Instagram users (Mage = 23.61, SDage = 5.33; 82.2% female) comprised the effective sample in this study. They responded to an online survey that included questionnaires regarding their Instagram and smartphone use, as well as about experiencing depression and anxiety symptoms. We also retrieved objectively measured Instagram use data. The results showed that although Instagram use frequency, depression, and anxiety were associated with PSU in bivariate analysis, Instagram use frequency did not have indirect effects in the relations between psychopathology variables and PSU. Furthermore, while younger age and female sex predicted Instagram use frequency, these socio-demographic variables did not predict PSU. According to our findings Instagram use frequency contributes to PSU, but it is not related to depression and anxiety. © The Author(s) 2020.","anxiety; depression; Instagram; problematic smartphone use; smartphone addiction; social media; social networking sites; structural equation model",,,,,,"H2020 Marie SkÅodowska-Curie Actions, MSCA: 799411

Among a sample of 325 iPhone users, we found that (a) participants misestimated their weekly overall iPhone and SM use by 19.1 and 12.2 hours, respectively; (b) correlations between estimated use and well-being variables were consistently stronger than the correlations between reported actual use and well-being variables; and (c) the degree of inaccuracy in estimated use was associated with levels of participant well-being and amount of use. These findings suggest that retrospective estimates of digital technology use may be systematically biased by factors that are fundamental to the associations under investigation. We propose that retrospective estimates of digital technology use may be capturing the construct of perceived use rather than actual use, and discuss how the antecedents, correlates, and consequences of perceived use may be distinct from those of actual use.

Where incidents used to be communicated through word of mouth, physical evidence, and news outlets, recent advances in crime tracking, mapping, and mobile media have dramatically changed how individuals are informed about crime. Many organizations have adopted mobile text alerts, and recent advances in augmented reality (AR) technologies have made it possible to overlay visuals about crime on top of users’ physical surroundings. How people make sense of this visual, individualized, and location-specific crime information, however, is largely unknown and complicated by the fact that mobile technologies are challenging to study in situ, as people move through and experience urban place. Within the AR literature, while existing research has started to look at the ways that AR can affect people’s experience of place, the precise ways that people perceive and integrate AR displays into their understanding of place are still largely unexplored. This empirical study reports findings from a project utilizing AR as an urban probe, where we took participants (N = 57) around to places in a large metropolitan area in the United States and showed them visual AR crime information overlaid on the physical place where they were moving through. After seeing these urban probes, participants were asked what they noticed, remembered, and thought occurred in that place when shown AR crime information. The analysis draws on Lefebvre’s (1991) spatial triad to explain how people read places through the lens of AR, and also how they extrapolate, speculate, and make associations from AR information. Based on these findings, this study discusses the implications for mobile media scholars and their understanding of visual place-based communication, as well as for designers and policymakers considering the use of AR to communicate crime information. © The Author(s) 2020.","augmented reality; crime; Lefebvre; space/place; urban probes",,,,,,,,,"Aitamurto, T., Boin, J.B., Chen, K., Cherif, A., Shridhar, S., The impact of augmented reality on art engagement: Liking, impression of learning, and distraction (2018) Lecture Notes in Computer Science: Vol. 10910.

Australia has been characterised as a country of vast distances, and young people living in rural and regional areas are at the centre of narratives that position digital technologies as enablers or disruptors. This paper puts such deterministic discourses aside to focus on the ways place is made by young people living outside the city according to their own perspectives and experiences. Focus groups with 62 participants aged 16–28 years pointed to many of those in-the-background place-making practices and signalled the near seamless way that making places was simultaneously done online as well as in material, face-to-face contexts. The forms of place made by the young people of this study comprised a range of elasticised neighbourhoods and public spaces that were materially anchored, though extended digitally through territorially embedded socialities and shared locational information. Regional geographies retained their meaning, though traditional constraints could be renegotiated to reflect youthful relationships with local place. © The Author(s) 2019.","mobile media; place-making; regional towns; young people",,,,,,,,,"Abeele, V.M.M., Mobile youth culture: A conceptual development (2016) Mobile Media & Communication, 4 (1), pp. 85-101; Aitken, S.C., (2001) Geographies of young people: The morally contested spaces of identity, , London, UK, Routledge; Alston, M., You don’t want to be a check-out chick all your life”: The out-migration of young people from Australia’s small rural towns (2004) Australian Journal of Social Issues, 39 (3), pp. 299-313; Amin, A., Thrift, N., (2002) Cities: Reimagining the urban, , Cambridge, UK, Polity Press; Anderson, M., Jiang, J., (2018) Teens, social media and technology 2018, , http://www.pewinternet.org/2018/05/31/teens-social-media-technology-2018/, Retrieved from Pew Research Centre website; (2014) Household use of information technology, Australia, 2016–17, , http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/mf/8146.0, (, a)., Retrieved from; (2014) The Australian statistical geography standard (ASGS) remoteness structure, , http://www.abs.gov.au/websitedbs/D3310114.nsf/home/remoteness+structure, (, b)., [Map].

For this study, we employed a general ethnographic methodology and, in particular, a workshop based on different artistic techniques that encouraged the young people involved to become active participants, committed from the start in the generation of the material to be used for the analysis of their daily practices. This approach emerged from the recognition of the importance for these young people to feel included and connected. Migrant adolescents take refuge in their mobile devices to participate in the youth microculture, both locally and globally. In addition, they are able to access different social networks that allow them to play out the personas they wish to adopt. Finally, we recognise the importance of digital media in allowing them to maintain close and affective relationships with their relatives, fellow citizens, and communities in their country of origin. © The Author(s) 2019.","adolescence; experimental ethnography; family; identity; mobile phones; transnationalism; unaccompanied foreign minors",,,,,,"Eusko Jaurlaritza","The authors would like to thank Karen Rojas for her insightful comments which led to improvements in this article.

Such messages may also offer response options, which create bilateral communications with potential voters. This article examines responsiveness to political text messages during election campaigns and the factors that affect such responsiveness, using a natural experiment in which the campaign headquarters of 3 municipal candidates sent text messages to the residents of 3 municipalities. Findings indicate that response rates ranged from 4% to 18%, which approximate the response rates to marketing campaigns and other forms of text-based political participation. Age and gender did not have a significant effect on response rates, but message personalization (texts that include recipient identity) and response mode (text reply/landing page) did. These findings offer new empirical evidence of certain patterns of mobile interactions that encourage political participation. © The Author(s) 2019.","participation; political participation; smartphone; social media; text messages",,,,,,,"The authors would like to thank Prof. Sam Lehman-Wilzig and Dr. Hananel Rosenberg for their useful comments, and InforUMobile for their technological assistance and support.

In this paper, we describe how the installation of a Wi-Fi signal in a Guaraní community in Greater Buenos Aires—as part of the community leader’s decolonizing media projects—generated issues within the community. While much indigenous media research concerns the politics of cultural representation, we consider the politics of everyday, intracommunity mobile communication practices. Firstly, our findings show how the choice of communication medium can become a political issue. An upsurge in mobile-mediated communication within the community contributed to the decline of face-to-face deliberations, which were the mainstay of communal sharing arrangements and which held a central position in understandings of Guaraní culture. Secondly, our findings show how discrepancies between users’ communication preferences and the readily available mobile media services can generate a use barrier by deterring users from obtaining the skills needed to effectively appropriate or transform mobile media services. Familiarity with a few mainstream social media apps not only reinforced imaginaries of the Internet as a nonindigenous space but also generated set ideas of what the Internet supports in terms of communicative form—social networking—and content type—mainstream media. In the end, the community leader’s decolonizing projects, aimed at using social media for community media dissemination, were not only rejected by community members but also undermined by the dynamics of mobile media practices in the community. We argue that limited mobile technology skills combined with commercially oriented mobile media services can hinder creative and adaptable mobile media practices, and in turn, undermine decolonizing mobile appropriations. © The Author(s) 2019.","communicative ecology; community communication; cultural revitalization; decolonization; digital inclusion; indigenous media; mobile communication; mobile Internet; mobile media; mobile technology appropriation",,,,,,"Universitat Oberta de Catalunya, UOC","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This research was supported by a Universitat Oberta de Catalunya (UOC) Information and Knowledge Society doctoral grant to the first author.",,"Amit, V., Rapport, N., (2002) The trouble with community, , London, UK, Pluto Press, (Eds; Bar, F., Weber, M.S., Pisani, F., Mobile technology appropriation in a distant mirror: Baroquization, creolization, and cannibalism (2016) New Media and Society, 18 (4), pp. 617-636; Baraldini, V., Cañicul, M., Cian, C., Juan, C., Melillán, M., (2012) Comunicación con identidad: Aportes para la construcción del modelo de comunicación indígena en Argentina (Communication with identity: Contributions towards the making of an indigenous communication model in Argentina), , Buenos Aires, Argentina, INAI, (Eds.)., [,]; Basanta, J.J., Communication and ICT in Argentinean indigenous organizations (2013) TecCom Studies, 5 (3), pp. 31-37. , [,]; Becerra, M., Mastrini, G., (2015) New rules of the game in telecommunications in Argentina, , http://www.observacom.org/new-rules-of-the-game-in-telecommunications-in-argentina/, Retrieved from; Bell, W., (2008) A remote possibility: The battle for Imparja Television, , Alice Springs, Australia, IAD Press; Brauchler, B., Postill, J., (2010) Theorising media and practice, , New York, NY, Berghahn Books, (Eds; Brody, N., Opting out of social media: Online communication attitudes mediate the relationship between personality factors and Facebook non-use (2018) Southern Communication Journal, 83 (2), pp. 75-88; Budka, P., From marginalization to self-determined participation: Indigenous digital infrastructures and technology appropriation in northwestern Ontario’s remote communities (2015) Journal des Anthropologues, 142-143, pp. 127-153; Carpentier, N., Community media as rhizome: Expanding the research agenda (2016) Journal of Alternative and Community Media, 1, pp. 4-6; Carrillo, A.J., Having your cake and eatinig it too?

In this paper, we examine selfies as a situated practice, connecting the social media phenomenon to the local spaces where it is performed. Based on ethnographic studies of selfie photography, we present and discuss three aspects of selfies in the wild. First, we consider selfies as part of a larger photographic context and show how they are often taken in series with other genres of images. Second, we expand upon the notion of selfies as conversation and show how selfie photographers exchange messages with remote friends and followers while attending to the local environment. Third, we discuss socializing around selfies, examining how copresent friends socialize around the production of selfies.

Based on findings from the Games of Mobile Australian Research Council Project, we present examples of how mobile devices bring about particular scenarios of Minecraft play within the household and family dynamics. These scenarios include renegotiating household spaces through acts of mobile Minecraft play, the development of physical gesture rituals through mobile touchscreen interactions, and the complex negotiations involved in shared device usage between different family members. We make the case that through these familial scenarios, the space of Minecraft can become an extension of the family home. These findings offer new insights into mobile-device-based engagement with Minecraft and provide a solid base of information for academic researchers and social policymakers seeking to understand the Minecraft and mobile phenomena. As mobile technology grows in ubiquity, mobile Minecraft becomes increasingly embedded in acts of play. We propose that Minecraft on mobile devices reshapes Australian perceptions of play, creativity, and family dynamics. © The Author(s) 2019.","digital games; digital play; family home; Minecraft; mobile devices",,,,,,"Australian Research Council, ARC: DP140104295","The author(s) declared following potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: Larissa Hjorth and Ingrid Richardson are Chief Investigators of the Games of Being Mobile project, which is funded by an Australian Research Council Discovery Grant (DP140104295).",,"Amialchuk, A., Kotalik, A., Do your school mates influence how long you game?

This paper investigates these default effects among adolescents configuring apps that either satisfy relatedness or enhance autonomy by protecting privacy. Relatedness and privacy are two innate needs that adolescents can satisfy with the use of smartphone apps. This study argues that adolescents’ choice of features supporting either privacy protection or social relatedness is a consequence of default effects, so that adolescents adhere to preselected defaults. We test this assumption in an experimental survey design including four app configuration tasks with N = 280 German adolescents aged 11 to 20 years. The study finds support for default effects for privacy as well as social relatedness.

While traditional conceptions of networked infrastructures render them necessarily immobile and centralized, this article rethinks the concept of networked infrastructures to instead consider their mobility. In doing so, this article conceptualizes mobilized networked infrastructures (MNIs) and examines their implications in three sections: Forms of Action, Production of Networked Space, and Ways of Knowing. The Forms of Action section indicates that, over time, MNIs have allowed for new spaces and practices of communicative mobility. The Production of Networked Space section considers the speculative potential for MNIs to deterritorialize networked space, but argues that MNIs often reinforce already networked spaces and reterritorialize deterritorialized networked space. Finally, the Ways of Knowing section examines the mobility of networked infrastructures as a new way of knowing by allowing the tracking of infrastructural mobilities in addition to, and in concert with, the tracking of human and nonhuman actors. © The Author(s) 2019.","infrastructures; mobilities; network; network access; networked infrastructures",,,,,,,,,"Abrahamson, E.J., (2003) Hear me now: Competition, regulation and the pace of innovation in mobile telephony in the United States, 1945–1984, , Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, (Unpublished doctoral dissertation; Andrejevic, M., Privacy, exploitation, and the digital enclosure (2007) Amsterdam Law Forum, 4 (1), pp. 47-62; Andrejevic, M., Burdon, M., Defining the sensory society (2015) Television & New Media, 16 (1), pp. 19-36; Bang, A.O., Ramteke, P., MANET: History, challenges, and application (2013) International Journal of Application or Innovation in Engineering and Management, 2 (9), pp. 249-251; Blake, A.M., Audible citizenship and audiomobility: Race, technology, and CB radio (2011) American Quarterly, 63 (1), pp. 531-553; Boyle, C., (2018) Rhetoric as a posthuman practice, , Columbus, Ohio State Press; Bratton, B., (2015) The stack: On software and sovereignty, , Cambridge, MA, The MIT Press; Castells, M., (2000) The rise of the network society, , Malden, MA, Blackwell; Castells, M., (2009) Communication power, , New York, NY, Oxford University Press; Couclelis, H., Misses, near-misses and surprises in forecasting the informational city (2007) Societies and cities in the age of instant access, pp. 71-83. , Miller H.J., (ed), Dordrecht, the Netherlands, Springer, (Ed.), (., –; Crandall, J., The geospatialization of calculative operations: Tracking, sensing, and megacities (2010) Theory, Culture, & Society, 27 (6), pp. 68-90; Cresswell, T., Towards a politics of mobility (2010) Environment and Planning D: Society and Space, 28 (1), pp. 17-31; Deleuze, G., Guattari, F., (1987) A thousand plateaus: Capitalism and schizophrenia, , Massumi B., (ed), Minneapolis, University of Minnesota Press, (, Trans; de Souza e Silva, A., Location-aware mobile technologies: Historical, social and spatial approaches (2013) Mobile Media & Communication, 1 (1), pp. 116-121; de Souza e Silva, A., Frith, J., Re-narrating the city through the presentation of location (2014) The mobile story: Narrative practices with locative technologies, pp. 34-49. , Farman J., (ed), New York, NY, Routledge, (Ed.), (., –; de Souza e Silva, A., Frith, J., Locational privacy (2016) Foundations of mobile media studies: Essential texts on the formation of a field, pp. 171-193. , Farman J., (ed), New York, NY, Routledge, (Ed.), (., –; Dourish, P., Bell, G., (2011) Divining a digital future, , Cambridge, MA, The MIT Press; Foucault, M., (1995) Discipline and punish: The birth of the prison, , Sheridan A., (ed), New York, NY, Vintage Books, (, Trans; Frith, J., Splintered space: Hybrid spaces and differential mobility (2012) Mobilities, 7 (1), pp. 131-149; Galloway, A., Thacker, E., (2007) The exploit: A theory of networks, , Minneapolis, University of Minnesota Press; Gane, N., Beer, G., (2008) New media: The key concepts, , New York, NY, Bloomsbury Press; Gibson, C., Lackman, S., Brenman-Horley, C., (Putting) mobile technologies in their place: A geographical perspective (2011) Mobile technologies and place, pp. 123-139. , Wilken R., Goggin G., (eds), New York, NY, Routledge, (Eds.), (., –; Goggin, G., (2006) Cell phone culture: Mobile technology in everyday life, , London, UK, Routledge; Graham, S., Marvin, S., (2001) Splintering urbanism: Networked infrastructure, technological mobilities, and the urban condition, , London, UK, Routledge; Hannam, K., Sheller, M., Urry, J., Editorial: Mobilities, immobilities, and moorings (2006) Mobilities, 1 (1), pp. 1-22; Horst, H., The infrastructures of mobile media: Toward a future research agenda (2013) Mobile Media & Communication, 1 (1), pp. 147-152; Jensen, O., Drone city – Power, design, and aerial mobility in the age of “smart cities.

Drawing on a scoping literature review and expert interviews, we show how social robots come with privacy implications that go beyond those of established mobile technology. Social robots challenge not only users’ informational privacy but also affect their physical, psychological, and social privacy due to their autonomy and potential for social bonding. These distinctive privacy challenges require study from varied theoretical perspectives, with contextual privacy and human–machine communication emerging as particularly fruitful lenses. Findings also point to an increasing focus on technological privacy solutions, complementing an evolving legal landscape as well as a strengthening of user agency and literacy. © The Author(s) 2019.","expert interviews; mobile media; privacy; scoping review; social robots",,,,,,"Norges ForskningsrÃ¥d: 275347, 247745","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: Christoph Lutz received funding from the Research Council of Norway (grant number 247745 “Fair Labor in the Digitized Economy” and grant number 275347 “Future Ways of Working in the Digital Economy”) while working on this article.",,"Acharya, A., (2015) Are we ready for driver-less vehicles?

As such, consumer drones afford “communication on the fly” in their medium-specific configuration of aerial navigation, visual production, and networked communication. Drawing on in-depth interviews with drone users and auto-ethnographic drone practices, I first highlight what physical-material conditions the flying camera mediates. An analysis of what digital-intangible formations the sensor medium collects and creates follows, before I turn to the sociospatial relations the buzzing mobile interface can establish and disrupt. I show how these conditions of communication on the fly shape user practices of place-sensing and place-making. Through the lenses of mobile communication research, media ecology, and mobilities studies, I ultimately illuminate how the ambiguous aerial system helps expand our thinking of and with notions of communication on the move. © The Author(s) 2019.","camera drone; consumer drone; locative media; media ecology; mobile communication; mobile media; mobilities research",,,,,,"International Communication Association, ICA","I am grateful to Mimi Sheller, Ernest Hakanen, and Brent Luvaas for their valuable comments on a previous draft of this article.

Extending well beyond use as an air-conditioning tool, the hand-fan has evolved across centuries and cultures to become a portable screen, a game console, an artistic medium, and an elaborate communication device. Drawing on the scholarly, literary, and art history of hand-fans in North Asian and European contexts, this paper excavates a deep history of hand-fans and connects them to contemporary mobile communication devices. This research develops two key aspects of the hand-fan as a communicative apparatus: first, the fan as an optical image surface to store and transmit information, constituting the earliest portable screen, and second, the fan as a haptic and gestural object from which distinct vernaculars arise. This paper maps a radical new trajectory in how we conceptualise the hand-fan in history and the mobile phone in the present. © The Author(s) 2019.","hand fan; handheld devices; haptic; media archeology; media history; mobile phone; optic; portable devices",,,,,,,,,"Addison, J., Steele, R., (1853) The Spectator.

The focus of this article is on the fluctuating fortunes of one U.S. company: Skyhook Wireless. The company was founded in 2003 with the explicit aim of exploring and developing systems that responded to a very specific communication infrastructure related challenge: how to calculate location positioning from Wi-Fi signals rather than from cellular towers or by using GPS? In this article, I detail the technical means by which they achieved this, and examine how the strength of Skyhook’s position in the field of location positioning and analysis became a key factor driving Google’s highly contentious Street View program for extracting and recording Wi-Fi access point and payload data. Through this analysis of Skyhook Wireless and its technical achievements, this article aims to contribute valuable new knowledge to our understanding of the location-related operations of mobile devices; the infrastructures associated with these operations; and the businesses that have emerged around, draw on, contribute to, and have come to dominate, these infrastructural systems. © The Author(s) 2019.","communication infrastructures;

The arguments at the core of this article bring together, and build on, recent theoretical developments in (a) locative media, (b) automobiles as mobile media, and (c) new mapping technologies, practices, and spatial media to provide a coherent perspective of cars as mobile spatial media. Informed by a geographical political economy of navigation, this perspective contributes to our understanding of cars in the context of digital and informational capitalism as these vehicles undergo qualitative transformations catalyzed by increased digital interconnections and comprehensive automation. © The Author(s) 2019.","autonomous navigation; digital economy; GPS; on-board navigation; self-driving cars",,,,,,,,,"Alvarez León, L.F., Property regimes and the commodification of geographic information: An examination of Google Street View (2016) Big Data & Society, 3 (2); Appleyard, D., Lynch, K., Myer, J.R., (1964) The view from the road, , Cambridge, MA, MIT Press; Arai, M., Nakamura, Y., Shirakawa, I., (2015) History of development of map-based automotive navigation system “Honda Electro Gyrocator., , 2015 ICOHTEC/IEEE International History of High-Technologies and their Socio-Cultural Contexts Conference (HISTELCON), IEEE, In; Arthur, C., Apple Maps: Tim Cook says he is “extremely sorry (2012) The Guardian, , https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/sep/28/apple-maps-tim-cook-apology, September, 28, (,)., Retrieved from; Auer, A., Feese, S., Lockwood, S., (2016) History of intelligent transportation systems, , https://trid.trb.org/view/1418799, (Report FHWA-JPO-16-329).

Though largely overlooked by historians of technology, these mobile, less-than-mobile, and relatively immobile devices helped shape the social and cultural uses of contemporary mobile communication. I argue that the technological capabilities of portables altered users’ expectations for how and where computers could be incorporated into daily life, be it near bodies, on hand, or at one’s fingertips. While the market for bulky portables dwindled by the late 1990s, as laptops and cell phones became more ubiquitous, these consumer electronics are nonetheless useful today for understanding the perpetual role of materiality and embodiment in how we conceive of the imagined affordances of mobile communication technologies. © The Author(s) 2018.","affordances; embodied; history; laptop; materiality; mobility; portable; smartphone",,,,,,,,,"Alper, M., (2017) Giving voice: Mobile communication, disability, and inequality, , Cambridge, MA, MIT Press; Angus, J., Multimedia portable computers: Presentation is everything (1995) InfoWorld, 17 (11), pp. 68-69. , March, 13; Atkinson, P., Man in a briefcase: The social construction of the laptop computer and the emergence of a type form (2005) Journal of Design History, 18 (2), pp. 191-205; Atkinson, P., A bitter pill to swallow: The rise and fall of the tablet computer (2008) Design Issues, 24 (4), pp. 3-25; Bates, J., Dynabook sees laptop opening new chapter in computers (1989) Los Angeles Times, , June, 27, (,)., p. 203; Berg, E.N., Pacesetting computer maker files for bankruptcy (1983) New York Times, , September, 15, (,)., p.

This paper explores parent perceptions and attitudes toward two mobile interventions (Text4baby and Univision Contigo) designed to support parents’ engagement with their young children as a way of reducing the language gap and improving child outcomes. We conducted eight focus groups with parents who were users of either service. Using general inductive analysis of the transcript data, we found that parents enrolled in the Text4baby service were relatively unaware of the video text messages and almost never clicked the links. Univision Contigo users, on the other hand, more frequently recalled seeing videos encouraging parent–child interaction and particularly liked that these videos came as multimedia messages (MMS). We interpret findings through a social cognitive theory lens and provide recommendations for incorporating video into parent-targeted mobile interventions. © The Author(s) 2018.","language development; MMS; mobile health; SMS; text messaging; Text4baby",,,,,,"Clinton Foundation","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/ or publication of this article: This research was supported by a grant from Pearson Education provided to The Clinton Foundation.

In family connect, categories of across distance, reassurances, and boundaries are shared. Within family disconnect, distractions, misunderstandings, and negative emotional responses are conveyed.

The “accumulation” of phones by individuals is widely observed, though underexplored in scholarship. Popular media coverage in the US frames the possession of multiple phones by people in poverty as criminal or excessive. In contrast, this study identifies three functions for phone accumulation as a strategy for maintaining phone access: to back up other phones, to build up capacities across phones, and to share phones with others in need. Each function responds to struggles unique for the urban poor as mobile technology advances and public phone access declines. Extra phones insure against regular disconnections due to loss and theft of devices and limits on subsidized service. Active service on one device combines with Internet functionality on another to approximate a single, high-end device and service plan. Subsidized phones help overcome the hesitation that poor people feel in lending out their devices to others in need. Accumulation thus contributes to the goal of securing reliable phone access for low-income Americans. There are limits to accumulation as a strategy for maintaining access, which result from the prevalence of inferior hardware, limited service plans, and lack of trust among strangers. Telecommunications policies should adapt to the needs of low-income phone users with accumulation in mind.

Applying an exploratory approach through grounded theory, participants (N = 52) from Amazon’s Mechanical Turk provided common reasons for retaining voicemail artifacts. Results highlighted why participants retained or deleted general and specific voicemails. Five categories, past-focused, important, future-focused, sentimental, and neglectful, represented retaining reasons. The oldest and most important artifacts represented sentimental messages. Three categories, past-focused, technological affordance, and unremarkable or undesirable calls, represented reasons for deletion. Voicemails are paralleled to mass and interpersonal communication and implications make connections between information retention, temporality, and interpersonal memorialization. Findings indicate that asynchronous communication exchanges and relics, such as voicemails, offer linkages to and reverberations of old and emerging technologies. © The Author(s) 2018.","archival practices; memory; nostalgia; rumination; temporality; voice; voicemail",,,,,,,,,"Abeele, M., Beullens, K., Roe, K., Measuring mobile phone use: Gender, age and real usage level in relation to the accuracy and validity of self-reported mobile phone use (2013) Mobile Media & Communication, 1, pp. 213-236; Barasch, A., Diehl, K., Silverman, J., Zauberman, G., Photographic memory: The effects of volitional photo taking on memory for visual and auditory aspects of an experience (2017) Psychological Science, 28, pp. 1056-1066; Baron, N.S., Do mobile technologies reshape speaking, writing, or reading?

As mobile health apps aim at helping users manage their healthy lifestyles and health conditions, it is important for researchers, developers, and educators to know how individuals find and assess the quality and credibility of these apps, and what guides their decisions to download and use them. We conducted semistructured interviews using the think-aloud technique with 19 community members in a U.S. Midwestern city and analyzed the data using open coding thematic analysis to determine how smartphone users assess health apps before downloading them. We find users determined app credibility through quick, but holistic cues based on the app’s features, and “borrowed” credibility decisions from friends or other health app users. App quality was often equated to personal preferences, that is, how the app met those preferences.

The general aim of Pokémon Go is to discover and then capture Pokémon. This article reports on an original research project designed to explore the impact of Pokémon Go on spatiality and sociability. The project was conducted between May 2017 and July 2017, using an online survey which received 375 responses from users of Pokémon Go geographically spread across the globe. Drawing on the concept of the “playeur” as an established approach to understanding the effects of locative play on spatiality and sociability, this research follows three lines of enquiry. First, the research examines whether the intermingling of play and ordinary life might encourage players to spend more time outside in public spaces, and how this mode of play is experienced. Second, the research explores whether the game mechanics of Pokémon Go might lead players to traverse their environment using modified routes, as well as to frequent new places. Third, the research examines whether the praxis of Pokémon Go might enable new forms of sociability to emerge that extend beyond earlier HRGs. © The Author(s) 2018.","flâneur; hybrid reality games (HRG); location-based social networking sites (LBSN); playeur; Pokémon Go; spatial practices",,,,,,,,,"Benjamin, W., (1999) The arcades project, , Eiland H., McLaughlin K., (eds), Cambridge, MA, Harvard University Press, (, Trans; De Souza e Silva, A., Pokémon Go as an HRG: Mobility, sociability, and surveillance in hybrid spaces (2017) Mobile Media & Communication, 5 (1), pp. 20-23; De Souza e Silva, A., Frith, J., Locational privacy in public spaces: Media discourses on location-aware mobile technologies (2010) Communication, Culture & Critique, 3 (4), pp. 503-525; De Souza e Silva, A., Sutko, D.M., Playing life and living play: How hybrid reality games reframe space, play, and the ordinary (2008) Critical Studies in Media Communication, 25 (5), pp. 447-465; Evans, L., Saker, M., (2017) Location-based social media: Space, time and identity, , Cham, Switzerland, Springer International; Frank, A., (2016) Six Pokémon GO tips for the ultimate beginner, , https://www.polygon.com/2016/7/9/12136310/pokemon-go-tips-how-to-play-beginners, Retrieved from; Frith, J., The digital “lure”: Small businesses and Pokémon Go (2017) Mobile Media & Communication, 5 (1), pp. 51-54; Hjorth, L., Richardson, I., Pokémon GO: Mobile media play, place-making, and the digital wayfarer (2017) Mobile Media & Communication, 5 (1), pp. 3-14; Huizinga, J.H., (1992) Homo ludens: A study of the play-element in culture, , Boston, MA, Beacon Press; Humphreys, L., Involvement shield or social catalyst: Thoughts on sociospatial practice of Pokémon GO (2017) Mobile Media & Communication, 5 (1), pp. 15-19; Kato, T.A., Teo, A.R., Tateno, M., Watabe, M., Kubo, H., Kanba, S., Can Pokémon GO rescue shut-ins (hikikomori) from their isolated world?

This paper aims to explore if China’s social stratification has influenced the adoption and use of mobile social apps and if social apps such as WeChat can help to bridge the digital divide by providing urban and rural users equal access to diverse information and communication resources. The study is based on 4 months of fieldwork in the Henan Province of central China and combines quantitative data from surveys and qualitative data from semistructured interviews and focus groups. We found that there still exists a digital gap in the adoption and use of mobile social apps such as WeChat between rural and urban China, but such differences are also associated with demographic variables such as age, gender, and education level. Meanwhile, we found that WeChat has become more than a communication tool; it has also played an essential role in everyday problem-solving and information seeking for both rural and urban users. Our qualitative interviews and focus group studies reveal how WeChat influences various aspects of daily life in developing areas in China.

One of these areas that has been garnering interest is mobile augmented reality (AR) technologies. While much of the earliest research in AR was primarily focused on answering computer science and engineering related questions, social science and humanities scholars have started taking note of AR as perhaps the next major development in mobile media. Given that much of this research has been distributed across interdisciplinary lines and from many different theoretical perspectives, this piece identifies some early lines of media, communication, and social science research into AR and identifies key themes and areas of focus: AR users/nonusers, AR devices, AR content, and AR industry. By organizing these lines of research, this manuscript serves as a call for specific future areas of research, suggests new approaches that researchers could take to explore interrelationships between these areas, and advocates for the necessity of research that examines different levels (micro/meso/macro) of analysis within AR. The goal of this piece is to advance a framework that informs and motivates mobile scholars to consider and integrate AR into their research areas, at a moment where it is in the process of moving from science fiction to material reality, from blueprint to prototype, and from laboratory to homes, cars, workplaces, and pockets. © The Author(s) 2018.","AR content; AR devices; AR industry; AR nonusers; AR users; augmented reality",,,,,,,,,"Ananny, M., Creating proper distance through networked infrastructure: Examining Google Glass for evidence of moral, journalistic witnessing (2015) Boundaries of journalism: Professionalism, practices and participation, pp. 83-100. , Carlson M., Lewis S.C., (eds), Abingdon, UK, Routledge, (Eds.), (., –; Appignani, T.P., Archer, J., Guzman, A.L., Neill-Hoch, I., Jones, S., (2015) The world according to Glass: How the world sees Google Glass and how it sees the world, , October, Panel presentation at the 2015 Association of Internet Researchers, Phoenix, AZ; Azuma, R.T., A survey of augmented reality (1997) Presence: Teleoperators and Virtual Environments, 6 (4), pp. 355-385; Barba, E., MacIntyre, B., Mynatt, E.D., Here we are!

These spaces—for example, cultural “timeouts,” leisure, and backpacking travel—necessitate a certain degree of cutting oneself off from one’s daily routine, which is threatened by the constant presence of one’s cell phone. This study examines the role of cell phones in young adults’ backpacking experience. Using questionnaires (n = 105) and in-depth interviews (n = 14) with “cellular backpackers” and “cell-free backpackers,” the study shows how an attempt is made to reduce availability and attain maximum control over the scope and timing of communication, using a variety of avoidance practices. Those practices derived from the personal narrative structure of the backpacking experience as an escapist, “dropping-off-the-radar” one, and as an attempt to preserve the trek as a space that is cut off and isolated from a technology-saturated environment. In addition, it was found that backpackers care a great deal about their parents’ position when making their decisions whether to take their phones with them and when to use them. In this regard, the article continues the discussion on the metaphor of the cell phone as a transitional object, applying this concept from childhood and adolescence to the twenties and thirties, the ages of most backpackers. On another level, the article addresses the mobile phone’s unique function as an antistatus symbol, in a way that contradicts its function in an ordinary context. © The Author(s) 2018.","avoidance practices; backpackers; status symbol; transitional object; young adults",,,,,,,,,"Berger, A.A., (2000) Media and communication research methods: An introduction to qualitative and quantitative approaches, , Thousand Oaks, CA, SAGE; Berger, E.A., Paris, C.M., Exploring the role of Facebook in re-shaping backpacker’s social interactions (2013) Information and communication technologies in tourism 2014, pp. 299-312. , Xiang Z., Tussyadiah I., (eds), London, UK, Springer, (Eds.), (., –; Bittman, M., Brown, J.E., Wajcman, J., The cell phone, constant connection, and time scarcity in Australia (2009) Social Indicators Research, 93 (1), pp. 229-233; Blondheim, M., Liebes, T., Television news and the nation: The end?

The concept of “affordances” has long been used to answer such questions. In this paper, we use Hartson’s definition of affordances to qualitatively investigate rural Kenyan women’s interactions with their mobile phones. Our detailed analysis provides empirically grounded answers to questions about the cognitive, physical, and sensory affordances of handsets used in our field sites and how they support and/or constrain mobile communication. We then discuss the implications of our findings: in particular, how this affordance-based approach draws attention to mobile phones’ design features and to the context in which they and their users are embedded—a focus which suggests new design and research opportunities in mobile communication. © The Author(s) 2018.","affordances; design; Kenya; mobile phones; rural; women",,,,,,"United States Agency for International Development, USAID","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This publication was made possible through support provided by the U.S. Agency for International Development under the terms of Agreement No. AID-OAA-F-14-00028.

This article argues that to better understand mobile messaging we must also attend to its disconnective affordances—the opportunities for disconnection facilitated by the material properties of messaging platforms and mobile devices. Drawing on interview research into the mobile messaging practices of 24 young people, this article proposes a typology of five disconnective affordances that participants used to manage and limit their connections to friends and family, and to mobile devices and platforms. In highlighting these affordances, this article enables a better understanding of how people manage and limit availability to and through mobile messaging, actions that are increasingly necessary as mobile communication becomes ever more deeply embedded in daily life. In doing so, this article also demonstrates the value of key developments in the theorisation of affordances by applying newly developed terms and concepts to an empirical example. © The Author(s) 2018.","affordances; availability management; disconnection; mobile communication; mobile messaging; young people",,,,,,,,,"Baumer, E., Adams, P., Khovanskaya, V., Liao, T., Smith, M., Schwanda Sosik, V., Williams, K., Limiting, leaving, and (re)lapsing: An exploration of Facebook non-use practices and experiences (2013) Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems, pp. 3257-3266. , New York, NY, ACM, (., –; Birnholtz, J., Davison, J., Li, A., Attending to attention: How do people attract, manage, and negotiate attention using mobile devices?

Now they also have a bridging foot in cyberspace, as Internet-enabled smartphones mediate their travel experience. Social-web-assisted mobility means that gazing down at a smartphone screen can either enhance or hamper a traveller’s movement through a destination and their interaction with place and its inhabitants, either distancing them from local people or offering new means to connect with hosts and enhance the travel experience. An Internet-linked smartphone is like a portal through which the traveller can gaze into different directions. Further, it is not just a question of which direction they choose; the choice will impact on the gazer and the performance of the gaze, potentially compromising attempts to view a place through independent eyes as the traveller’s imaginings of the foreign sphere are influenced by the social web. This paper reviews the literature on how travellers use the Internet before, during, and after a trip, and suggests the concept of the liminal gaze—in which an individual chooses between different directions to look at and different spheres to focus on—as a tool to examine smartphone-mediated interaction between people, and between people and place. © The Author(s) 2018.","mobile communication; power; privilege; social web; tourist–host relationship; traveller behaviour",,,,,,,,,"Abeele, M.M.P.V., Antheunis, M.L., Schouten, A.P., The effect of mobile messaging during a conversation on impression formation and interaction quality (2016) Computers in Human Behavior, 62, pp. 562-569; Amersdorffer, D., Bauhuber, F., Oellrich, J., The economic and cultural aspects of the social web: Implications for the tourism industry (2012) Journal of Vacation Marketing, 18 (3), pp. 175-184; Andrews, H., Roberts, L., (2012) Liminal landscapes: Travel, experience and spaces in-between, , Abingdon, UK, Routledge; Appleford, S., Bottum, J.R., Thatcher, J.B., Understanding the social web: Towards defining an interdisciplinary research agenda for information systems (2014) The Data Base for Advances in Information Systems, 45 (1), pp. 29-37; Bender, J., Gidlow, B., Fisher, D., National stereotypes in tourist guidebooks: An analysis of auto- and hetero-stereotypes in different language guidebooks about Switzerland (2013) Annals of Tourism Research, 40, pp. 331-351; Bhabha, H., (1994) The location of culture, , New York, NY, Routledge; Bosangit, C., McCabe, S., Hibbert, S., What’s told in travel blogs?

We collected online survey data regarding people’s attachment orientation and dating app preferences. People with a more anxious attachment orientation were more likely to report using dating apps than people lower in anxious attachment; people with a more avoidant attachment orientation were less likely to report using dating apps than people lower in avoidant attachment. Participants who used dating apps cited Tinder, OkCupid, and Plenty of Fish as those most commonly used. The most common reason people reported for using apps was to meet others, and the most common reason people reported for not using apps was difficulty trusting people online. Our findings suggest that individual differences in attachment may be relevant for understanding online behavior, and that dating apps might be a fruitful avenue for future research on attachment-related differences. © The Author(s) 2018.","anxious attachment; attachment; avoidant attachment; dating apps; potential partners; romantic relationships",,,,,,"Bombardier

However, attachment to the mobile phone means more than addiction as experienced by young populations in developed nations. This paper attempts to explore the various forms of attachment across a working population in Africa. It is aimed at establishing the forms of attachment to the mobile phone and their possible sociodemographic variations. Data was collected from 374 used-clothing traders in Accra, using a mixed-methods approach. Employing the conversion framework from domestication theory, a thematic analysis showed that attachment to mobile phone use is culturally specific. A principal component analysis revealed five types of attachment with significant variations across age, gender, and level of education. © The Author(s) 2018.","addiction; Africa; attachment; domestication; Ghana; mobile phone; traders",,,,,,,,,"(1995) Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders, , Washington, DC, American Psychiatric Publishing; Asante, R.K., (2011) Mobile phone usage patterns: The case of market women in Ghana, , Saarbrücken, Germany, Lambert Academic; Asante, R.K., (2014) Domestication of the mobile phone amongst Kantamanto used-clothes traders in Accra, , Accra, Ghana, University of Ghana; Bartlett, M.S., A note on the multiplying factors for various chi square approximations (1954) Journal of the Royal Statistical Society.

The rapid rise of smartphone use calls for more scholarly attention paid to users’ media usage and time expenditure. This study aims to (a) understand smartphone usage patterns by examining time spent using smartphones and task switching between mobile applications (apps), and (b) test the validity of self-reported measures of these behaviors by comparing self-reports with log data from the smartphone. Data were collected from 50 participants over 1 week. Results show that on average participants spent 2 hours 39 minutes on their smartphone and made 101 app switches per day. Among other findings, social networking was the most used app category, age was a significant demographic factor, and participants, especially heavy smartphone users, overestimated their mobile app usage.

Heeding cautions from Boase (2013) concerning software variability across mobile technologies, as well as challenges from Ørmen and Thorhauge (2015) to use log data for qualitative research, our study offers one such methodological roadmap for observing—from the software side—the complex entanglements of humans and mobile technologies as they engage in mediated discourse. Our study draws upon keystroke analysis from the tradition of writing process research (Leijten & van Waes, 2013; Wengelin, 2006), as well as posthumanist methodologies for observing cybernetic interactions (Giddings, 2014), and extends Farman’s (2012) argument that asynchronous forms of mobile communication, such as text messaging, are performatively synchronous, since interlocutors are pulled toward embodied copresence via the mediated space. In doing so, we present a preliminary study of methods for directly observing how discursive processes manifest in-the-moment as a complex flow between human, machinic, and spatial components in a network assemblage. © The Author(s) 2017.","embodied performance; keystroke logging analysis; mobile discourse; synchronous observation; text-messaging",,,,,,,,,"Barad, K., (2007) Meeting the universe halfway: Quantum physics and the entanglement of matter and meaning, , Durham, NC, Duke University Press; Baron, N.S., Do mobile technologies reshape speaking, writing, or reading?

These data reveal the way smartphone usage patterns tend to be organized according to notification functions (mSNS, SMS), a specific set of technical cues that mediatize social demand and promote social connectedness. Users manage these cues through a recurrent trend composed of a three-step sequence: they often start by using applications displaying notifications; they favor those that display social demands; and, among them, they prioritize these relational solicitations in accordance with social status or types of relationships. By examining the distribution of users’ attention between urban environments and smartphone applications, this video-ethnography also highlights how these “checking habits” are organized according to a set of spatial cues and some daily commute characteristics, such as visual coordination with passengers in public transport. These technical cues mediatize a growing number of social demands that encourage users to keep their eyes focused on their smartphone’s screen in public spaces. We argue that these technical cues create a temporary bubble effect and social isolation at a proximal scale, which mostly operate at the beginning of smartphone usage patterns. © The Author(s) 2018.","connection cue; mobile phone; mobility; social media; usage pattern",,,,,,"Agence Nationale de la Recherche, ANR: ANR-16-CE26-0014-0","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/ or publication of this article:The French National Research Agency generiously supported this research (The Listic project - ANR-16-CE26-0014-0).",,"Bayer, J.B., Campbell, S.W., Ling, R., Connection cues: Activating the norms and habits of social connectedness (2015) Communication Theory, 26 (2), pp. 128-149; Bentley, F., Tollmar, K., (2013) The power of mobile notifications to increase wellbeing logging behavior, pp. 1095-1098. , Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors Computing Systems, New York, NY, ACM, (., –; Bian, M., Leung, L., Linking loneliness, shyness, smartphone addiction symptoms, and patterns of smartphone use to social capital (2015) Social Science Computer Review, 33 (1), pp. 61-79; Böhmer, M., Hecht, B., Schöning, J., Krüger, A., Bauer, G., (2011) Falling asleep with Angry Birds, Facebook and Kindle: A large scale study on mobile application usage, pp. 47-56. , Proceedings of the 13th International Conference on Human Computer Interaction with Mobile Devices and Services, New York, NY, ACM, (., –; Boyd, D.M., Ellison, N.B., Social network sites: Definition, history, and scholarship (2008) Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication, 13 (1), pp. 210-230; Brown, B., McGregor, M., Laurier, E., (2013) iPhone in vivo: Video analysis of mobile device use, pp. 1031-1040. , Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors Computing Systems, New York, NY, ACM, (., –; Castells, M., (2010) The rise of the network society.

A sample of 404 university students in Kuwait indicated they took and posted selfies for motives of appraisal-seeking self-presentation (ASSP), entertainment, status-updating self-presentation (SUSP) and documentation. Females were more likely to be involved in selfie-related activities and to use selfies for ASSP. Documentation was the prime predictor of the activity of “taking” selfies, SUSP was for “posting” selfies, and ASSP was for “editing” selfies. Self-perceived attractiveness predicted the activities of “posting” and “taking” selfies. Results are discussed in light of the influence of culture in Kuwait and some conceptual considerations about selfies are made. © The Author(s) 2017.","looking-glass self; motives; self-presentation; selfie; selfie activities",,,,,,,,,"Al-Kandari, A., Hasanen, M., The impact of the Internet on political attitudes in Kuwait and Egypt (2012) Telematics and Informatics, 29 (3), pp. 245-253; Al-Kandari, A., Melkote, S.R., Sharif, A., Needs and motives of Instagram users that predict self-disclosure use: A case study of young adults in Kuwait (2016) Journal of Creative Communications, 11 (2), pp. 85-101; Al-Kandari, A., Al-Sumait, F.Y., Al-Hunaiyyan, A., Looking perfect: Instagram use in a Kuwaiti cultural context (2017) Journal of International and Intercultural Communication, 10 (4), pp. 273-290; Al-Mutawa, F., Elliott, R., Nuttall, P., Foreign brands in local cultures: A socio-cultural perspective of postmodern brandscapes (2015) Journal of Consumer Behaviour, 14, pp. 137-144; Al-Saggaf, Y., Saudi females on Facebook: An ethnographic study (2011) International Journal of Emerging Technologies and Society, 9 (1), pp. 1-19; Al-Saggaf, Y., Begg, M., Online communities versus offline communities in the Arab/Muslim world (2004) Communication & Ethics in Society, 2, pp. 41-54; Barakat, H., (1993) The Arab world: Society, culture, and state, , Berkeley, University of California Press; Barry, C.T., Doucette, H., Loflin, D.C., Rivera-Hudson, N., Herrington, L.L., Let me take a selfie”: Associations between self-photography, narcissism, and self-esteem (2015) Psychology of Popular Media Culture, , Advance online publication; Bazarova, N.N., Choi, H.Y., Self-disclosure in social media: Extending the functional approach to disclosure motivations and characteristics on SNS (2014) Journal of Communication, 64, pp. 635-657; Bennett, S., (2014) A brief history of the #selfie (1839–2014), , http://www.mediabistro.com/alltwitter/first-everselfie-history_b58436, Retrieved from; Bleske-Rechek, A., Remiker, M.W., Baker, J.P., Narcissistic men and women think they are so hot – But they are not (2008) Personality and Individual Differences, 45, pp. 420-424; Chae, J., Virtual makeover: Selfie-taking and social media use increase selfie-editing frequency through social comparison (2017) Computers in Human Behavior, 66, pp. 370-376; Chester, W.C., (2016) Exploring the effects of gratifications, narcissism, sense of humor and sensation-seeking on the sharing humorous selfies online, , The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, (Unpublished doctoral dissertation; (2017) The world factbook.

Based on acculturation and mobile media theories, this study explores particularly how Chinese and Korean immigrant mothers’ child-rearing practices in the US are mediated by mobile media. Guided by the theoretical framework of interpretative phenomenological analysis (IPA), we conducted 16 in-depth interviews with Chinese and Korean immigrant mothers. Findings reveal that while going through the acculturation process, Chinese and Korean immigrant mothers attempt to play the traditional social role of mother as defined in their home countries when utilizing mobile media in their new home. Mobile media have symbolic meanings of empowerment and can be used as tools to deal with prejudice in the host country. This study also suggests that mobile media may mediate Chinese and Korean immigrant mothers’ acculturation processes when adopting different types of acculturation strategies (e.g., integration or separation). Implications for practice and future studies are further discussed. © The Author(s) 2018.","acculturation; Chinese and Korean American; mobile media; motherhood",,,,,,,,,"Barry, D.T., Grilo, C.M., Cultural, self-esteem, and demographic correlates of perception of personal and group discrimination among East Asian immigrants (2003) American Journal of Orthopsychiatry, 73, pp. 223-229; Bell, G., The age of the thumb: A cultural reading of mobile technologies from Asia (2006) Knowledge, Technology, & Policy, 19 (2), pp. 41-57; Berry, J.W., Acculturation and adaptation in a new society (1992) International Migration, 30 (S1), pp. 69-85; Berry, J.W., Immigration, acculturation, and adaptation (1997) Applied Psychology, 46 (1), pp. 5-34; Berry, J.W., A psychology of immigration (2001) Journal of Social Issues, 57, pp. 615-631; Campbell, S.W., Mobile communication and network privatism: A literature review of the implications for diverse, weak, and new ties (2015) Review of Communication Research, 3 (1); Castells, M., Fernández-Ardèvol, M., Qiu, J.L., Sey, A., (2007) Mobile communication and society: A global perspective, , Cambridge, MA, MIT Press; Chae, M.H., Acculturation conflicts among Asian Americans: Implications for practice (2001) The New Jersey Journal of Professional Counseling, 56, pp. 24-30; Chen, H., Zhou, L., Han, S., Protest and protect: Chinese urban mothers’ perception of smartphone (tablet) in their everyday lives’ communication and interaction with young children (2017) Journal of Asian Pacific Communication, 27 (1), pp. 99-120; Chib, A., Malik, S., Aricat, R.G., Kadir, S.Z., Migrant mothering and mobile phones: Negotiations of transnational identity (2014) Mobile Media & Communication, 2 (1), pp. 73-93; Corbin, J., Strauss, A., (2008) Basics of qualitative research, , 3rd ed., Thousand Oaks, CA, SAGE; Dalisay, F., Media use and acculturation of new immigrants in the Unites States (2012) Communication Research Reports, 29 (2), pp. 148-160; Elias, N., Lemish, D., Spinning the web of identity: The roles of the Internet in the lives of immigrant adolescents (2009) New Media & Society, 11 (4), pp. 533-551; Gibson, M.A., Immigrant adaptation and patterns of acculturation (2001) Human Development, 44 (1), pp. 19-23; Hang, Y., Chinese-language cyberspace, homeland media and ethnic media: A contested space for being Chinese (2015) New Media and Society, 17 (4), pp. 556-572; Hepp, A., The communicative figurations of mediatized worlds: Mediatization research in times of the “mediation of everything.

To address this gap, a multimethodological design was used. Qualitative interviews (n = 20) revealed 23 features in children’s apps that parents believe are important. A subsequent survey (n = 591) showed that parents want apps with (a) clear design; (b) tailorable, controllable, educational content; (c) challenges and rewards; and (d) technological innovation.

As such, the iNakba, as a new mobile application, is a mnemonic device utilized in a heated memory contestation that exemplifies how contemporary technological capabilities operate as a reminder for a society that seeks to forget. This study reveals that when marginalized groups struggle for recognition in society’s memory sphere, while capitalizing on contemporary media’s unique characteristics, they benefit from the blurring of the familiar distinction between communicative and cultural memory (Assmann & Czaplicka, 1995). The unique characteristics of new media create a new opportunity to make many more narratives and group memories known, officially organized, and mediated for mass audiences. These new memory affordances may contribute to establishing a culture of just memory that takes into consideration memory ethics and promotes the “duty to remember” the stories of the oppressed and marginalized. © The Author(s) 2018.","collective memory; cultural memory; Israeli–Palestinian conflict; media memory; mobile media; new media",,,,,,,,,"Aouragh, M., (2011) Palestine online: Transnationalism, the Internet and the construction of identity, , New York, NY, I.B.

Data were derived from 9 semistructured focus group interviews. Study participants were older adult residents of Michigan, US (N = 77). Focus groups were held in both urban and rural locations and our sample was heterogeneous in terms of race and socioeconomic status. Older adults in this study reported that the mobile phone behavior displayed by their younger family members during face-to-face interactions and family gatherings breaches their expectations regarding appropriate etiquette and manners. Specifically, participants reported they view mobile phone use during face-to-face interactions as disruptive to communication quality, offensive, and a potential signal of inattention, which may curtail intergenerational communication and hinder their sense of copresence. Limitations of our study and directions for future research are discussed. © The Author(s) 2018.","copresence; intergenerational communication; mobile communication; mobile etiquette; older adults; phubbing",,,,,,"National Science Foundation

This case study of Mobile Voices (VozMob) explores a community-based approach to PD and its potential to promote the participation of groups typically marginalized from the design process, and to empower users. VozMob is a mobile platform that was codesigned with and for immigrant workers and organizers to facilitate the online publishing of multimedia stories about their lives and their social justice efforts. Through collective visualization methods, observation, and interviews, this study investigates the factors that enabled or hindered meaningful user participation in the VozMob design process. Significant differences emerged between participants’ experiences of the design process, which allow for the exploration of themes related to technology appropriation, design ownership, and power sharing in collaborative processes. Our findings reveal that a community-based approach to PD can shed light on the degree to which—and how—collaborative design and equitable participation is possible through mobile media. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.","appropriation; collective analysis; digital storytelling; mobile communication; participatory design; popular communication; social justice",,,,,,"Social Science Research Council

Using apps may help researchers to scale up the reach, precisely control randomization and experiment materials, collect a variety of objective and self-reported data over time, and more conveniently replicate and adapt an experiment. We performed a systematic review on field experiments involving apps published between 2007 and 2017. Seven databases were scanned using a predefined search strategy. The database search retrieved 4,810 citations; 101 articles met the inclusion criteria. Our review suggests that scholars have only started to employ apps in field experiments in the last 4 years. Most studies only used apps as an experiment treatment instead of an experiment platform; therefore, researchers have yet to fully leverage the advantages. Almost all studies were from the health research domain and 77.2% used randomized controlled trial design. Only 7 studies utilized smartphone sensors for collecting data. Only one study reported cost and ethical concerns regarding using apps for the experiment. Given these findings, we reported a case study that targeted a minority racial group and leveraged the advantages of apps as an experiment platform and as a data collection tool to illustrate practical challenges and lessons learned regarding time, financial cost, and technical support. In conclusion, we suggest apps provide new ways to study causal mechanisms with experiment big data. Limitations of generalizability, retention, and design quality were discussed as well. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.","case study; field experiment; mobile app; smartphone; systematic review",,,,,,,,,"Aharony, N., Pan, W., Ip, C., Khayal, I., Pentland, A., Social fMRI: Investigating and shaping social mechanisms in the real world (2011) Pervasive and Mobile Computing, 7 (6), pp. 643-659; (2013) Cancer facts & figures 2013, , https://www.cancer.org/content/dam/cancer-org/research/cancer-facts-and-statistics/annual-cancer-facts-and-figures/2013/cancer-facts-and-figures-2013.pdf, Retrieved from; Asgary, R., Sckell, B., Alcabes, A., Naderi, R., Adongo, P., Ogedegbe, G., Perceptions, attitudes, and experience regarding mHealth among homeless persons in New York City shelters (2015) Journal of Health Communication, 20 (12), pp. 1473-1480; Banerjee, A., Duflo, E., (2017) Handbook of economic field experiments, , Amsterdam, the Netherlands, North-Holland; Ben-Zeev, D., Brenner, C.J., Begale, M., Duffecy, J., Mohr, D.C., Mueser, K.T., Feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of a smartphone intervention for schizophrenia (2014) Schizophrenia Bulletin, 40 (6), pp. 1244-1253; (2011) National diabetes fact sheet, 2011, , https://www.cdc.gov/diabetes/pubs/pdf/methods11.pdf, Retrieved from; Chaudhri, R., Brunette, W., Goel, M., Sodt, R., VanOrden, J., Falcone, M., Borriello, G., (2012) Open data kit sensors: Mobile data collection with wired and wireless sensors, pp. 1-10. , Proceedings of the 2nd ACM Symposium on Computing for Development, New York, NY, ACM; (2017) The 2016 U.S. mobile app report, , https://www.comscore.com/Insights/Presentations-and-Whitepapers/2016/The-2016-US-Mobile-App-Report, Retrieved from; Ferguson, T., Rowlands, A.V., Olds, T., Maher, C., The validity of consumer-level, activity monitors in healthy adults worn in free-living conditions: A cross-sectional study (2015) International Journal of Behavioral Nutrition and Physical Activity, 12, p. 42; Gerber, A.S., Green, D.P., (2012) Field experiments: Design, analysis, and interpretation, , New York, NY, W.

It investigates the incorporation of audio and sound recording devices, observation, and note-taking into a mobile (auto)ethnographic research methodology, to research a large-scale commemorative event in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. On May 4, 2016, the sounds of a Silent March—through the streets of Amsterdam to Dam Square—were recorded and complemented by video grabs of the march’s participants and onlookers. We discuss how the mixed method enabled a multilevel analysis across visual, textual, and aural layers of the commemorative atmosphere. Our visual data aided in our evaluation of the construction of collective spectacle, while the audio data necessitated that we venture into new analytic territory. Using Sonic Visualiser, we uncovered alternative methods of “reading” landscape by identifying different sound signatures in the acoustic environment. Together, this aural and visual representation of the May 4 events enabled the identification of spatial markers and the temporal unfolding of the Silent March and the national 2 minutes’ silence in Amsterdam’s Dam Square. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.","audio-visual recording; memory; mobile methods; silence; war commemoration",,,,,,,,,"Ahmed, S., Happy objects (2010) The affect theory reader, pp. 29-51. , Gregg M., Seigworth G., (eds), Durham, NC, Duke University Press, In, (Eds.); Anderson, B., Recorded music and practices of remembering (2004) Social & Cultural Geography, 5 (1), pp. 3-20; Beristain, C.M., Paez, D., González, J.L., Rituals, social sharing, silence, emotions and collective memory claims in the case of the Guatemalan genocide (2000) Psicothema, 12, pp. 117-130; Birdsall, C.J., Sound memory: A critical concept for researching memories of conflict and war (2016) Memory, place and identity: Commemoration and remembrance of war and conflict, pp. 111-129. , Drozdzewski D., De Nardi S., Waterton E., (eds), London, UK, Routledge, In, (Eds.); Bissell, D., Passenger mobilities: Affective atmospheres and the sociality of public transport (2010) Environment and Planning D: Society and Space, 28 (2), pp. 270-289; Brockmeier, J., Remembering and forgetting: Narrative as cultural memory (2002) Culture and Psychology, 8, pp. 15-43; Brown, S.D., Two minutes of silence: Social technologies of public commemoration (2012) Theory & Psychology, 22 (2), pp. 234-252; Büscher, M., Urry, J., Witchger, K., (2010) Mobile methods, , London, UK, Routledge, (Eds.); Butler, T., A walk of art: The potential of the sound walk as practice in cultural geography (2006) Social & Cultural Geography, 7 (6), pp. 889-908; Butler, T., Memoryscape: How audio walks can deepen our sense of place by integrating art, oral history and cultural geography (2007) Geography Compass, 1 (3), pp. 360-372; Casserly, R., Parading music and memory in Northern Ireland (2014) Música e Cultura, 9 (1); D’Andrea, A., Ciolfi, L., Gray, B., Methodological challenges and innovations in mobilities research (2011) Mobilities, 6 (2), pp. 149-160; De Haan, I., (1997) Na de ondergang: De herinnering aan de jodenvervolging in Nederland, , The Hague, the Netherlands, Sdu; Dewulf, J., Amsterdam memorials, multiculturalism, and the debate on Dutch identity (2012) Imagining global Amsterdam: History, culture and geography in a world city, pp. 239-254. , De Waard M., (ed), Amsterdam, the Netherlands, Amsterdam University Press, In, (Ed.); Drozdzewski, D., Encountering memory in the everyday city (2016) Memory, place and identity: Commemoration and remembrance of war and conflict, pp. 27-57. , Drozdzewski D., De Nardi S., Waterton E., (eds), Abingdon, UK, Routledge, In, (Eds.); Drozdzewski, D., De Nardi, S., Waterton, E., Geographies of memory, place and identity: Intersections in remembering war and conflict (2016) Geography Compass, 10 (11), pp. 447-456; Duffy, M., Waitt, G., Gibson, C., Get into the groove: The role of sound in generating a sense of belonging at street parades (2007) Altitude, 8, pp. 1-32; Ehrenhaus, P., Silence and symbolic expression (1988) Communications Monographs, 55 (1), pp. 41-57; (2017) Households – Devices to access the Internet, , http://appsso.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/nui/show.do?dataset=isoc_ci_id_h&lang=en, a)., [Data set].

The ubiquity of mobile technologies, coupled with their affordances of connecting people and accessing information anytime, anywhere, brings new opportunities for community informatics research. These same affordances also entrain new methodological challenges in capturing and understanding mobile technology use, as mobile-supported interactions can be difficult to study systematically. Such interactions are often situated in complex social and physical settings, such as the local community context. In response to these challenges, we describe the method for scripting events that participants enact within their community and through which we probe how mobile technology impacts community building and vice versa. With the scripted method, we emphasize the need to integrate multiple streams of data and analyses to triangulate and obtain a holistic picture of community interactions. This scripted method is designed to afford ecological validity in employing socially and behaviorally realistic activities, while maintaining some research control, in providing a standard scaffold for participants to enact target behaviors. We discuss how our method could be leveraged in other mobile media communication studies involved in complex social and physical contexts. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.","awareness and participation; community informatics; field experiment; methodology; mobile information technology",,,,,,,,,"Boase, J., Implications of software-based mobile media for social research (2013) Mobile Media & Communication, 1 (1), pp. 57-62; Boase, J., Ling, R., Measuring mobile phone use: Self-report versus log data (2013) Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication, 18 (4), pp. 508-519; Bohøj, M., Borchorst, N.G., Bødker, S., Korn, M., Zander, P.-O., (2011) Public deliberation in municipal planning: Supporting action and reflection with mobile technology, pp. 88-97. , Proceedings of the 5th International Conference on Communities and Technologies, New York, NY, ACM; Cahn, E.S., (2004) No more throw-away people: The co-production imperative, , 2nd ed., Washington, DC, Essential Books; Carroll, J.M., (2014) The neighborhood in the Internet: Design research projects in community informatics, , London, UK, Routledge; Carroll, J.M., Chen, J., Yuan, C.W.T., Hanrahan, B.V., In search of coproduction: Smart services as reciprocal activities (2016) Computer, 49 (7), pp. 26-32; Carroll, J.M., Rosson, M.B., Wild at home: The neighborhood as a living laboratory for HCI (2013) ACM Transactions on Computer–Human Interaction (TOCHI), 20 (3); Carroll, J.M., Rosson, M.B., Farooq, U., Xiao, L., Beyond being aware (2009) Information and Organization, 19 (3), pp. 162-185; Carroll, J.M., Rosson, M.B., Zhou, J., (2005) Collective efficacy as a measure of community, pp. 1-10. , Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems, New York, NY, ACM; Cheng, J., Bernstein, M., (2014) Catalyst: Triggering collective action with thresholds, pp. 1211-1221. , Proceedings of the 17th ACM Conference on Computer Suorted Cooperative Work & Social Computing, New York, NY, ACM; Consolvo, S., Walker, M., Using the experience sampling method to evaluate ubicomp applications (2003) IEEE Pervasive Computing, 2 (2), pp. 24-31; Dearman, D., Hawkey, K., Inkpen, K.M., Rendezvousing with location-aware devices: Enhancing social coordination (2005) Interacting with Computers, 17 (5), pp. 542-566; Freifeld, C.C., Chunara, R., Mekaru, S.R., Chan, E.H., Kass-Hout, T., Iacucci, A.A., Brownstein, J.S., Participatory epidemiology: Use of mobile phones for community-based health reporting (2010) PLoS Med, 7 (12), p. e1000376; Green, N., On the move: Technology, mobility, and the mediation of social time and space (2002) The Information Society, 18 (4), pp. 281-292; Grudin, J., Groupware and social dynamics: Eight challenges for developers (1994) Communications of the ACM, 37 (1), pp. 92-105; Gurstein, M., (1999) Community informatics: Enabling communities with information and communications technologies, , Hershey, PA, Idea Group; Hagen, P., Robertson, T., Kan, M., Sadler, K., (2005) Emerging research methods for understanding mobile technology use, pp. 1-10. , Proceedings of the 17th Australia Conference on Computer–Human Interaction: Citizens Online: Considerations for Today and the Future; Han, K., Shih, P.C., Bellotti, V., Carroll, J.M., It’s time there was an app for that too: A usability study of mobile timebanking (2015) International Journal of Mobile Human Computer Interaction (IJMHCI), 7 (2), pp. 1-22; Han, K., Shih, P.C., Rosson, M.B., Carroll, J.M., (2014) Enhancing community awareness of and participation in local heritage with a mobile application, pp. 1144-1155. , Proceedings of the 17th ACM Conference on Computer Suorted Cooperative Work & Social Computing, New York, NY, ACM, (, a); Han, K., Shih, P.C., Rosson, M.B., Carroll, J.M., Understanding local community attachment, engagement and social support networks mediated by mobile technology (2014) Interacting with Computers, 28 (3), pp. 220-237. , b); Han, K., Wirth, R., Hanrahan, B.V., Chen, J., Lee, S., Carroll, J.M., (2016) Being connected to the local community through a festival mobile application, , iConference 2016 Proceedings; Hu, Y., Farnham, S.D., Monroy-Hernández, A., (2013) Whoo.ly: Facilitating information seeking for hyperlocal communities using social media, pp. 3481-3490. , Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems, New York, NY, ACM; Humphreys, L., Mobile social media: Future challenges and opportunities (2013) Mobile Media & Communication, 1 (1), pp. 20-25; Humphreys, L., Involvement shield or social catalyst: Thoughts on sociospatial practice of Pokémon Go (2016) Mobile Media & Communication, 5 (1), pp. 15-19; Jacucci, G., Oulasvirta, A., Salovaara, A., Sarvas, R., (2005) Supporting the shared experience of spectators through mobile group media, pp. 207-216. , Proceedings of the 2005 International ACM SIGGROUP Conference on Suorting Group Work, New York, NY, ACM; Kenyon, S., Reshaping patterns of mobility and exclusion?

While extensive research has examined how people go about finding answers to questions online, there has been little work investigating the issue from a more holistic, in situ perspective that covers the various devices, resources, and contextual factors that influence everyday question-asking experiences. To address this, we developed a text-messaging-based data-collection framework. This paper details our approach including reflections on both the benefits and challenges of the methodology for researchers seeking to apply similar approaches to social science research. In doing so, we demonstrate how our methodology helps establish a contextually rich understanding of information-seeking processes. We also demonstrate our approach to analyzing data from a small but diverse group of adults across the United States about their everyday question-asking experiences. © 2018, © The Author(s) 2018.","ESM; experience sampling; information seeking; methods; mobile data collection; question-asking; SMS; text-messaging",,,,,,"Google","The authors disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/ or publication of this article: The authors appreciate the generous support of a Google Research Award that helped make this project possible.",,"Anderson, M., (2015) Technology device ownership: 2015, , http://www.pewinternet.org/2015/10/29/technology-device-ownership-2015/, Retrieved from; Bolger, N., Davis, A., Rafaeli, E., Diary methods: Capturing life as it is lived (2003) Annual Review of Psychology, 54 (1), pp. 579-616; Bolger, N., Laurenceau, J.-P., (2013) Intensive longitudinal methods: An introduction to diary and experience sampling research, , New York, NY, Guilford Press; Borgatti, S.P., Cross, R., A relational view of information seeking and learning in social networks (2003) Management Science, 49 (4), pp. 432-445; Bradburn, N.M., Rips, L.J., Shevell, S.K., Answering autobiographical questions: The impact of memory and inference on surveys (1987) Science (New York, N.Y.), 236 (4798), pp. 157-161; Church, K., Cherubini, M., Oliver, N., A large-scale study of daily information needs captured in situ (2014) ACM Transactions on Computer–Human Interaction (TOCHI), 21 (2), p. 10; Cohen, A.A., Lemish, D., Real time and recall measures of mobile phone use: Some methodological concerns and empirical applications (2003) New Media & Society, 5 (2), pp. 167-183; Consolvo, S., Walker, M., Using the experience sampling method to evaluate Ubicomp applications (2003) IEEE Pervasive Computing, 2 (2), pp. 24-31; Csikszentmihalyi, M., (2014) Flow and the foundations of positive psychology:The collected works of Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, , Dordrecht, the Netherlands, Springer, (Ed.); De Choudhury, M., Morris, M.R., White, R.W., (2014) Seeking and sharing health information online: Comparing search engines and social media, pp. 1365-1376. , Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems, New York, NY, ACM; Fisher, K.E., Naumer, C.M., Information grounds: Theoretical basis and empirical findings on information flow in social settings (2006) New directions in human information behavior, pp. 93-111. , Spink A., Cole C., (eds), Dordrecht, the Netherlands, Springer, In, (Eds.); Hargittai, E., Beyond logs and surveys: In depth measures of people’s web use skills (2002) Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology, 53 (14), pp. 1239-1244; Hargittai, E., Digital na(t)ives?

The devices’ capabilities to automatically log behavioural data as well as the integration of this log data into qualitative interviews for elicitation purposes promise increased validity. The paper argues that despite recent efforts in mixed methods, the methodological potential of the personalized user interfaces of smartphones has been overlooked. As these smartphone interfaces are the result of continuous personalization processes, they can be seen as snapshots of the phone’s current use. Thus, this form of data should have strong explanatory powers for understanding the related mobile media practices. The paper discusses the implications of this interface-based approach with two example studies where smartphone interfaces were integrated into qualitative interviews. It concludes that the approach is a useful addition to existing mobile media methods and enforces the notion that researchers need to discover new forms of data. © 2018, © The Author(s) 2018.","mixed methods; mobile methods; personalization; qualitative research; user interface",,,,,,,,,"Aroldi, P., Vittadini, N., Audiences as socio-technical actors: The “styles” of social network site users (2015) Revitalising audience research: Innovations in European audience research, pp. 195-214. , Zeller F., Ponte C., O’Neill B., (eds), New York, NY, Routledge, In, (Eds.); Barkhuus, L., Polichar, V.E., Empowerment through seamfulness: Smart phones in everyday life (2011) Personal Ubiquitous Computing, 15, pp. 629-639; Bjur, J., Schrøder, K.C., Hasebrink, U., Courtois, C., Adoni, H., Nossek, H., Cross-media use: Unfolding complexities in contemporary audiencehood (2014) Audience transformations: Shifting audience positions in late modernity, pp. 15-29. , Carpentier N., Schrøder K.C., Hallett L., (eds), New York, NY, Routledge, In, (Eds.); Blom, J.O., Monk, A.F., Theory of personalization of appearance: Why users personalize their PCs and mobile phones (2003) Human–Computer Interaction, 18 (3), pp. 193-338; Boase, J., Implications of software-based mobile media for social research (2013) Mobile Media & Communication, 1 (1), pp. 57-62; Boase, J., Ling, R., Measuring mobile phone use: Self-report versus log data (2013) Journal of Computer Mediated Communication, 18 (4), pp. 508-519; Bødker, S., Christiansen, E., (2012) Poetry in motion: Appropriation of the world of apps, pp. 78-84. , Proceedings of the 30th European Conference on Cognitive Ergonomics, New York, NY, ACM; Böhmer, M., Krüger, A., (2013) A study on icon arrangement by smartphone users, pp. 2137-2146. , Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems, New York, NY, ACM; Bouwman, H., de Reuver, M., Heerschap, N., Verkasalo, H., Opportunities and problems with automated data collection via smartphones (2013) Mobile Media & Communication, 1 (1), pp. 63-68; Campbell, S.W., Park, Y.J., Social implications of mobile technology: The rise of personal communication society (2008) Sociology Compass, 2 (2), pp. 371-387; Couldry, N., The necessary future of the audience.. and how to research it (2011) The handbook of media audiences, pp. 213-229. , Nightingale V., (ed), Oxford, UK, Blackwell, In, (Ed.); Couldry, N., Hepp, A., (2017) The mediated construction of reality, , Cambridge, UK, Polity; Dean, J., Apps and drive (2015) Theories of the mobile Internet, pp. 232-248. , Herman A., Hadlaw J., Swiss T., (eds), New York, NY, Routledge, In, (Eds.); De Reuver, M., Bowman, H., Heerschap, N., Verkasalo, H., Smartphone measurement: Do people use mobile applications as they say they do?

Using a case study of Hong Kong lesbian app Butterfly, I explicate how and why users cosituate on and off the app within their context. By analyzing digital ethnography and offline interviews data, I argue that Butterfly provides a mobile communication infrastructure for users to meet their lesbian needs and desires of (in)visible self, relationships, and community. The spatiality and mobility of the app enable users to cosituate in (a) the online and offline public and private spaces, (b) the disclosure and concealment of lesbian identities, and (c) the individual lesbian fantasies and sociocultural, political, and religious contexts. However, users’ cosituation as tactical resistance to the heteronormative context does not come without a cost. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.","cosituation; lesbian smartphone app; mobile intimacy; public/private space",,,,,,,,,"(2012) Ethics, , https://aoir.org/ethics/, Retrieved from; Baym, N.K., A call for grounding in the face of blurred boundaries (2009) Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication, 14 (3), pp. 720-723; Baym, N.K., Social networks 2.0 (2011) The handbook of Internet studies, pp. 384-405. , Consalvo, Ess, (eds), Malden, MA, Blackwell,.

Thanks to its thriving user-created public accounts, WeChat, a globally popular mobile social media app based in China, has become a digital source of news and information. Informed by the uses and gratifications framework, the present study examines predictors of reposting articles from WeChat public accounts and subscribing to these accounts. Findings show that use of WeChat for public communication is extensive. Predictors of such behavior include mass media and Internet use. Also, perceived credibility of WeChat is a significant predictor. With demographic and media use variables being controlled, two gratifications of WeChat (i.e., dependence on WeChat for information and mobile connectedness with one’s circles) were found to be the strongest predictors of reposting articles on WeChat public accounts. The theoretical implications of information mobility for changing China’s status quo in media environments are discussed. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.","mobile public sphere; mobile social networking apps; public communication; uses and gratifications; WeChat",,,,,,,,,"Andsager, J.L., Perceptions of credibility of male and female syndicated political columnists (1990) Journalism & Mass Communication Quarterly, 67 (3), pp. 485-491; Basole, R., (2004) The value and impact of mobile information and communication technologies, , http://www.ti.gatech.edu/basole/docs/Basole.IFAC04.ValueMobileICT.pdf, Proceedings of the 2004 IFAC Symposium,.

To help address this issue the present study explicates a method for measuring media use and competition, the time–space diary, and reports a methodological study testing the robustness of this method across 3 diary instruments. Following a summary of concepts central to mobile media use and measurement, this study reports findings from data collected using 3 types of time–space diaries. Results indicate no significant difference between diary methods (paper and pencil, audio recorder, mobile device) on the likelihood of reported media use, and minimal differences in patterns of competitive superiority, supporting the reliability of the method. Paper-and-pencil diaries are argued to offer the greatest use flexibility relative to audio recorders and mobile devices, and received higher ease of use scores relative to mobile devices. The article concludes with a discussion of the utility of the time–space diary method for emerging mobile media research which must account for media use in novel times and places, as well as multichannel media consumption. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.","diary method; media competition; media measurement; niche theory; uses and gratifications",,,,,,,,,"Albarran, A.B., Dimmick, J.W., An assessment of utility and competitive superiority in the video entertainment industries (1993) Journal of Media Economics, 6 (2), pp. 45-51; Ankeny, J., Think mobile, act local (2013) Entrepreneur, 41 (5), pp. 54-57; Banerjee, S., Dholakia, R., Mobile advertising: Does location-based advertising work?

These apps have become the hosts for everyday communication among a wide variety of users and, thanks to the functionalities of certain apps, have taken on new significance in reporting. Especially in Hong Kong (a high-income, high-tech society in which smartphones are in widespread use) and mainland China (an emerging market with more than 1 billion mobile phone users), journalists have turned to these apps to complement face-to-face interactions to gather news. Drawing on a case study building on in-depth interviews with foreign correspondents based in China and Hong Kong, this article discusses how journalists use chat apps and establish trust with their sources. This article explores journalistic sourcing on apps (e.g., encrypted or not encrypted; open or one-to-one communication), and seeks to understand individual and systemic levels of trust. It finds that there are differences of trust depending on the functionalities of individual chat apps, and that interactions in journalistic sourcing in face-to-face and online environments affect the generation and output of news stories. Chat apps allow reporters to use open or closed networks, and adopt one of several approaches: trust the network, master the network, or abandon the network. These findings suggest that chat apps have an important role in communicating with sources, and should be a part of efforts to theorize journalistic sourcing. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.","chat apps; China; foreign correspondents; Hong Kong; journalism; mobile media; sourcing; surveillance; trust",,,,,,"John S. and James L.

By using a historical approach, which is useful to determine the causes behind the changing processes of new technology, we examine the presmartphone era, focusing on the growth of mobile technologies before the successful launch of Korea’s smartphones in 2009. We divide the presmartphone era into four major periods, including the early mobile technologies period (between the 1980s and 1996), the CDMA period (between 1996 and the early 2000s), the Internet Platform for Interoperability (WIPI) period (2001–2007), and the iPhone period (between 2007 and 2009) before the introduction of locally made smartphones. We investigate multiple causes that led to the rise of the smartphone, both technologies and systems, surrounding the development of the early smartphones by analyzing not only power relations between several major players, such as the government, corporations, and global forces, but also the crucial role of mobile users as customers. We also map out the relationship between socioeconomic transitions and accompanying changes in mobile technologies, which are becoming part of contemporary smartphone technologies. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.","CDMA; history; smartphones; social construction of technology; WIPI",,,,,,"Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada, SSHRC: 453-2016-1436

However, in recent times, high levels of human migration alongside the rapid development of digital communication technologies are reconfiguring family traditions. This paper investigates the ways in which 21 overseas Filipino workers in Melbourne, Australia, and their left-behind family members in the Philippines use mobile devices and communications platforms to restage festive family rituals. Employing a visual method and drawing on in-depth interviews, the empirical study uncovers the personalised and heterogenous practices of the transnational Filipino family in performing intimacy at a distance, paving the way for constructing copresence during festivities. Importantly, using the mobilities lens (Urry, 2007) as a framework for critical investigation, the findings show that a disproportionate level of network capital as informed by age, gender, and social class produces “asymmetrical mobile intimacy.” The present study also reveals how ambivalent feelings emerge due to technological asymmetries and parameters. Importantly, transnational families often negotiate such contradictory experiences through mobile device use. By comparing and contrasting the mobile practices of dispersed family members, the present study uncovers the hidden social inequalities perpetuated in a networked family life. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.","asymmetrical mobile intimacy; Facebook; family ritual; Skype; smartphones; transnational Filipino family",,,,,,"Monash University, MU","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/ or publication of this article: This work was supported by a Monash University Postgraduate Publications Award.",,"Adey, P., Bissell, D., Hannam, K., Merriman, P., Sheller, M., Introduction (2013) The Routledge handbook of mobilities, p. 50. , Adey, Bissell, Hannam, Merriman, Sheller, (eds), New York, NY, Routledge,.

Accordingly, the interplay unfolds in a situation characterized by (a) an abundance of legally available music tracks and (b) low technical barriers for music listening, discovery, management, and sharing. This implies a major shift when compared to previous conditions for music consumption, and it provides the foundation upon which I developed the analysis. The article relies on qualitative material gathered in focus group discussions with smartphone streaming users in Oslo in September 2013. The findings suggest that the instant access to millions of songs yields a tension between intimacy and detachment in users’ relationship to music. In such an environment of numerous music consumption alternatives, freedom of choice is embraced, but apparently accompanied with a craving for scarcity. These opposing tendencies in the experience of music consumption are interpreted and acted on by the individual in the reflexive and social processes of self-construction. Thus, I propose that the self should be included into what in domestication studies has been coined “the articulations of media technologies.” The articulation of the self equips this analytical framework with a fourth pillar in addition to the previous three: object, content, and context. Moreover, the articulation of the self highlights a dimension that seems crucial to content consumption at large in the smartphone age. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.","articulations; consumption; domestication; identity; music; Norway; self; smartphones; streaming",,,,,,"Norges ForskningsrÃ¥d","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/ or publication of this article: The present research was funded by the Norwegian Research Council with Telenor and WiMP (now Tidal) as industrial partners.",,"Bauman, Z., Raud, R., (2015) Practices of selfhood, , Cambridge, UK, Polity; Boyd, D., (2014) It’s complicated: The social lives of networked teens, , New Haven, CT, Yale Univserity Press; Bull, M., iPod: A personalized sound world for its consumers (2010) Communicar, 17 (34), pp. 55-63; Courtois, C., Mechant, P., Paulussen, S., De Marez, L., The triple articulation of media technologies in teenage media consumption (2011) New Media and Society, 14 (3), pp. 401-420; Courtois, C., Verdegem, P., De Marez, L., The triple articulation of media technologies in audiovisual media consumption (2012) Television and New Media, 14 (5), pp. 421-439; Creswell, J.W., (2013) Qualiative inquiry & research design.

Through in-depth interviews and focus-group discussions with 74 users of gay mobile dating apps (Grindr and Jack’d) in Hong Kong, this study illustrates how the sociological concept of time can shed light on users’ experience of relationship formation through these apps. Specifically, the accelerated tempo of interactions facilitated by perpetual connectivity, mutual proximity awareness, and instant messaging was seen to entail instantaneous and ephemeral relationships. The interface design, which foregrounds profile photos and backgrounds textual self-descriptions, was perceived to structure the sequence of browsing and screening in favor of physical appearance and users seeking casual hook-ups. The findings suggest that the temporality of browsing and exchange on apps is incongruous with the temporal norms prescribing formation of friendship and long-term romance. Such incongruity affects the perceived quality and satisfaction of app use, frustrating users who seek more durable relationships. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.","gay men; Grindr; Jack’d; mobile apps; online dating; social media; time",,,,,,"Hong Kong Baptist University, HKBU: FRG1/15-16/006

In this environment, people must manage their attention to each other. Recent work suggests attention management can be considered as a dyadic negotiation process in which people are continually acting to display their own focus of attention and gather information about others’ focus of attention, and may seek to increase or decrease the current level of attention from their partner. To explore attention management and negotiation on mobile devices, we built a custom application to track people’s SMS and phone call activity. Drawing on log and transcript data, we use qualitative and quantitative methods to explore the details of attention management behavior within specific relationships for a few participants, and then used hierarchical clustering to identify different patterns of attention management in relationships of varying tie strength. Results suggest that attention is managed both implicitly and explicitly, with explicit negotiation more likely when there are conflicts. There are also substantial differences in interaction patterns by tie strength, with phone calls and shorter text response times more common for weaker ties. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.","attention; channel switching; conversation; negotiation; texting",,,,,,"National Science Foundation, NSF: 1217143","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/ or publication of this article: This work was supported in part by the National Science Foundation, Award #IIS-#1217143).",,"Ames, M., (2013) Managing mobile multitasking: The culture of iPhones on Stanford campus, pp. 1487-1498. , Proceedings of the 2013 Conference on Computer Suorted Cooperative Work, New York, NY: ACM,.

Results show differences in smartphone dependence and use based on race, age, income, and education. Minority group members, younger, lower income, and less educated users are more likely to be smartphone-dependent. Additionally, minorities and younger individuals use smartphones for more social activity, while White, younger, and higher income individuals use smartphones for more news/information activity. Findings support the usage gap hypothesis and suggest smartphones may act as both a bridge and a barrier for disadvantaged groups to overcome the digital divide. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.","device gap; digital divide; knowledge gap; mobile Internet; smartphones; usage gap",,,,,,,,,"Anderson, M., (2015) Technology device ownership: 2015, , http://www.pewinternet.org/2015/10/29/technology-device-ownership-2015/, Retrieved from; Bonfadelli, H., The Internet and knowledge gaps: A theoretical and empirical investigation (2002) European Journal of Communication, 17 (1), pp. 65-84; Brandtzæg, P.B., Heim, J., Why people use social networking sites (2009) Lecture Notes in Computer Science: Vol. 5621.

The proposed study adopts an interactionist perspective, using semistructured interviews as well as communicative behavior records provided by interviewees to analyze the interactions between young adults and their geographically distant parents through a mobile instant messaging (MIM) service application. Taking WeChat as a case, this study focuses specifically on the use of MIM to manage and maintain parent–child relationships in a translocal context. Findings confirm the interaction patterns of “connected presence” and further suggest an emerging “panoptic-presence” consciousness among the young adults, leading to a performative mode of interaction with their parents. Meanwhile, though individualism prevails among the younger generation, family values and norms rooted in traditional Chinese culture are found to be both explicitly and implicitly practiced. Limitations and future directions are also discussed. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.","Chinese translocal family; connected presence; mobile instant messaging; panoptic presence; relational interaction",,,,,,,,,"Axelsson, A., Perpetual and personal: Swedish young adults and their use of mobile phones (2010) New Media & Society, 12 (1), pp. 35-54; Bengtson, V.L., Roberts, R.E., Intergenerational solidarity in aging families: An example of formal theory construction (1991) Journal of Marriage and the Family, 53 (4), pp. 856-870; Büscher, M., Urry, J., Mobile methods and the empirical (2009) European Journal of Social Theory, 12 (1), pp. 99-116; Cao, J., The analysis of tendency of transition from collectivism to individualism in China (2009) Cross-Cultural Communication, 5 (4), pp. 42-50; Carbaugh, D., Cultural discourse analysis: Communication practices and intercultural encounters (2007) Journal of Intercultural Communication Research, 36 (3), pp. 167-182; Caron, A., Caronia, L., (2007) Moving cultures: Mobile communication in everyday life, , Montréal, Caa, McGill-Queen’s University Press; Castells, M., Fernández, M., Qiu, L., Sey, A., (2007) Mobile communication and society: A global perspective: A project of the Annenberg Research Network on International Communication, , Cambridge, MA, MIT Press; Chang, H., Holt, G., More than relationship: Chinese interaction and the principle of Kuan-Hsi (1991) Communication Quarterly, 39 (3), pp. 251-271; Chen, G.M., The impact of harmony on Chinese conflict management (2002) Chinese conflict management and resolution, pp. 3-17. , Chen, Ma, (eds), Westport, CT, Ablex,.

Early evidence-based studies have shown robust support for mHealth interventions implemented among people living with HIV (PLWH); however, this type of inquiry is lacking amongst the most vulnerable groups of PLWH such as men who have sex with men (MSM), prisoners, and those facing substance use disorders (SUDS) and structural instabilities. These populations face barriers more profound than the general PLWH population including social stigma and discrimination. In response to the lack of rigorous evaluation of mHealth implementation and the tremendous potential for mHealth tools in underserved PLWH, we propose a 3-pronged approach in rooting mHealth tools using evidence-based methodology—(a) assessing mHealth feasibility and accessibility through descriptive studies, (b) conducting pilot projects testing mHealth tools, and (c) integrating mHealth tools into existing large-scale studies. The set of research steps proffered here aims to build a solid body of evidence on mHealth interventions among underserved populations and the health conditions that disproportionately affect them. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.","cell phones; health belief model; mHealth; mobile technology; people living with HIV; technology acceptance model",,,,,,,,,"Agarwal, S., LeFevre, A.E., Lee, J., L’Engle, K., Mehl, G., Sinha, C., Labrique, A., Guidelines for reporting of health interventions using mobile phones: Mobile Health (mHealth) Evidence Reporting and Assessment (mERA) checklist (2016) BMJ, 352; Alarcon, J.O., Pun, M., Gutierrez, C., Whittembury, A., Tejada, R., Suarez, L., Cuchi, P., Estimation and analysis of HIV incidence in the adult population in Peru: Results of application of the MoT mathematical model (2012) Revista Peruana de Medicina Experimental y Salud Pública, 29 (4), pp. 452-460; Asiimwe, C., Gelvin, D., Lee, E.J., Amor, Y.B., Quinto, E., Katureebe, C., Berg, M., Use of an innovative, affordable, and open-source short message service-based tool to monitor malaria in remote areas of Uganda (2011) The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene, 85 (1), pp. 26-33; Atun, R., Sittampalam, S., (2006) A review of the characteristics and benefits of SMS in delivering healthcare, , http://www.vodafone.com/etc/medialib/public_policy_series.Par.38545.File.dat/public_policy_series_4.pdf, Retrieved from; Beyrer, C., Baral, S.D., van Griensven, F., Goodreau, S.M., Chariyalertsak, S., Wirtz, A.L., Brookmeyer, R., Global epidemiology of HIV infection in men who have sex with men (2012) Lancet, 380 (9839), pp. 367-377; Black, A.D., Car, J., Pagliari, C., Anandan, C., Cresswell, K., Bokun, T., Sheikh, A., The impact of eHealth on the quality and safety of health care: A systematic overview (2011) PLoS Med, 8 (1), p. e1000387; Blynn, E., (2015) Develop, build, foster – Overcoming the barriers to scale, , http://unfoundationblog.org/mobile-health-innovation/develop-build-foster-overcoming-the-barriers-to-scale/, Retrieved from; Bolding, G., Davis, M., Sherr, L., Hart, G., Elford, J., Use of gay Internet sites and views about online health promotion among men who have sex with men (2004) AIDS Care, 16 (8), pp. 993-1001; Bower, P., Wallace, P., Ward, E., Graffy, J., Miller, J., Delaney, B., Kinmonth, A.L., Improving recruitment to health research in primary care (2009) Family Practice, 26 (5), pp. 391-397; Catalani, C., Philbrick, W., Fraser, H., Mechael, P., Israelski, D.M., mHealth for HIV treatment & prevention: A systematic review of the literature (2013) Open AIDS Journal, 7, pp. 17-41; Chang, L.W., Njie-Carr, V., Kalenge, S., Kelly, J.F., Bollinger, R.C., Alamo-Talisuna, S., Perceptions and acceptability of mHealth interventions for improving patient care at a community-based HIV/AIDS clinic in Uganda: A mixed methods study (2013) AIDS Care, 25 (7), pp. 874-880; Chen, N.E., Meyer, J.P., Avery, A.K., Draine, J., Flanigan, T.P., Lincoln, T., Altice, F.L., Adherence to HIV treatment and care among previously homeless jail detainees (2013) AIDS and Behavior, 17 (8), pp. 2654-2666; (2009) The world factbook.

Some research has found detrimental effects of permanent availability and connectivity, other studies hint at beneficial effects resulting from users taking minibreaks from work. As there is some evidence for a recovery potential of mass media in general, the current study extends this line of research by examining whether smartphones also have such potential. To that end, we investigated the effects of smartphone use in fatiguing situations on recovery experiences and cognitive performance. After a fatigue-induction task, participants were observed in a waiting situation in order to check whether they used their mobile devices. Afterwards, data on their recovery experiences and cognitive performance were collected. The results demonstrate that smartphone use can be beneficial for some recovery dimensions but also detrimental for others. Smartphone use was positively related to cognitive performance, mediated through experiences of control. Results are discussed regarding the consequences of new mobile technologies and their potential to stay permanently Internet-connected. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.","cognitive performance; energetic arousal; mobile phones; recovery experiences; smartphones",,,,,,,,,"Bayer, J.B., Campbell, S.W., Ling, R., Connection cues: Activating the norms and habits of social connectedness (2016) Communication Theory, 26 (2), pp. 128-149; Becker, M.W., Alzahabi, R., Hopwood, C.J., Media multitasking is associated with symptoms of depression and social anxiety (2013) Cyberpsychology, Behavior, and Social Networking, 16, pp. 132-135; Binnewies, C., Sonnentag, S., Mojza, E.J., Daily performance at work: Feeling recovered in the morning as a predictor of day-level job performance (2009) Journal of Organizational Behavior, 30 (1), pp. 67-93; Boase, J., Ling, R., Measuring mobile phone use: Self-report versus log data (2013) Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication, 18 (4), pp. 508-519; Brown, B., McGregor, M., McMillan, D., 100 days of iPhone use: Understanding the details of mobile device use (2014) Proceedings of the 16th International Conference on Human–Computer Interaction with Mobile Devices & Services, pp. 223-232. , September, New York, NY, ACM,.

Through the domestication framework and actor-network theory, findings showed a unique overlay of actors influencing acquisition and adoption of apps, including: dependent users, “warm-gatekeepers,” mobile phone shops, and Facebook. Mediators such as Android skins, language skills, and other factors (mobile data pricing and network infrastructure) impact the relationships between these actors. Together, the impact of mediators on actor relationships highlighted a filtered means many users adopted to acquire new apps, a “two-step access” model of acquisition. This article traces how users acquire apps given this network of actors, following their journey and how they overcome challenges and limitations in their social and technological landscape. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.","actor-network theory; apps; Burma; domestication; mobile apps; mobile culture; mobile phones; Myanmar; phone; smartphones",,,,,,,,,"Akrich, M., The de-scription of technical objects (1992) Shaping technology/building society, pp. 205-224. , Bijker, Law, (eds), Cambridge, MA, MIT Press,.

Whether conflict over resources, knowledge, or territory, to name a few types, games challenge players to overcome obstacles in interesting and fun ways. Pokémon Go challenges players to find and capture Pokémon, which requires time, patience, skill, and the freedom to access the game map (i.e., spaces in the real world) to its fullest extent. When players are denied full access, either through a technical glitch in the game—like when a server crashes or when networks become unavailable—or through real or imagined threats of violence or harassment, the game becomes inherently unfair. How might we make sense of issues of accessibility, privilege, and race raised by the game?

Even the data that Pokémon Go is built from is generated by players of Niantic’s earlier locative game, Ingress. If there is nothing “new” about the phenomenon of Pokémon Go, then what is there to learn from its rapid ascension in the cultural zeitgeist? In this article I maintain that it is the increased ubiquity of the smartphone and its tendency to reconfigure existing media and cultural practices that has allowed the novelty of augmented reality and the nostalgia of Pokémon to converge in a perfect storm of branding, design, preexisting data, and established technologies. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.","casual play; games culture; mobile play; nostalgia; Pokémon; videogames",,,,,,,,,"Cui, Y., Roto, V., (2008) How people use the web on mobile devices, pp. 905-914. , Proceedings of the 17th International Conference on World Wide Web, New York, NY, ACM, (; Hjorth, L., Richardson, I., The waiting game: Complicating notions of (tele)presence and gendered distraction in casual mobile gaming (2009) Australian Journal of Communication, 36 (1), pp. 23-35; Juul, J., (2010) A casual revolution: Reinventing video games and their players, , Cambridge, MA, MIT Press; Kirkpatrick, G., Constitutive tensions of gaming’s field: UK gaming magazines and the formation of gaming culture 1981–1995 (2012) Game Studies, 12 (1). , http://gamestudies.org/1201/articles/kirkpatrick, ).

The design of the apps represents a departure from “old-school” dating sites as it relies on the affordances of mobile media. This might change the way individuals portray themselves as their authentic or deceptive self. Based on survey data collected via Mechanical Turk and using structural equation modeling, we assess how Tinder users present themselves, exploring at the same time the impact of their personality characteristics, their demographics, and their motives of use. We find that self-esteem is the most important psychological predictor, fostering real self-presentation but decreasing deceptive self-presentation. The motives of use—hooking up/sex, friendship, relationship, traveling, self-validation, and entertainment—also affect the two forms of self-presentation. Demographic characteristics and psychological antecedents influence the motives for using Tinder, with gender differences being especially pronounced. Women use Tinder more for friendship and self-validation, while men use it more for hooking up/sex, traveling, and relationship seeking. We put the findings into context, discuss the limitations of our approach and provide avenues for future research into the topic. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.","impression management; online identity; online relationships; self-presentation; social networks",,,,,,,,,"Ames, D.R., Rose, P., Anderson, C.P., The NPI-16 as a short measure of narcissism (2006) Journal of Research in Personality, 40 (4), pp. 440-450; Antheunis, M.L., Schouten, A.P., The effects of other-generated and system-generated cues on adolescents’ perceived attractiveness on social network sites (2011) Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication, 16 (3), pp. 391-406; Bareket-Bojmel, L., Moran, S., Shahar, G., Strategic self-presentation on Facebook: Personal motives and audience response to online behavior (2016) Computers in Human Behavior, 55, pp. 788-795; Bargh, J.A., McKenna, K.Y., Fitzsimons, G.M., Can you see the real me?

Due to the game’s sudden enormous success, many mobile phone users all over the world could experience for the first time playing a hybrid reality game. Hybrid reality games, however, are not new. For at least 15 years, researchers and artists experiment with the affordances of location-based mobile technology to create playful experiences that take place across physical and digital (i.e., hybrid) spaces. Blast Theory’s Can You See Me Now?, developed in 2001, is one of the first examples. Yet for a long time, these games remained in the domain of art and research, and had therefore a very limited player community. Previous research has identified three design characteristics of hybrid reality games: mobility, sociability, and spatiality; and three main aspects to analyze these games: the connection between play and ordinary life, the relevance of the play community, and surveillance. With hybrid reality games’ commercialization and popularity, some of the issues that have been at the core of these games for over a decade will remain the same, while other aspects will change. This paper uses Pokémon Go as an example of a hybrid/augmented reality game to explore the main social and spatial issues that arise when these games become mainstream, including mobility, sociability, spatiality, and surveillance. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.","hybrid reality games; hybrid spaces; location-based games; mobility; sociability; spatiality; surveillance",,,,,,,,,"De Souza e Silva, A., From cyber to hybrid: Mobile technologies as interfaces of hybrid spaces (2006) Space and Culture, 3, pp. 261-278; De Souza e Silva, A., Hybrid reality and location-based gaming: Redefining mobility and game spaces in urban environments (2009) Simulation & Gaming, 40 (3), pp. 404-424; De Souza e Silva, A., Sutko, D.M., Playing life and living play: How hybrid reality games reframe space, play, and the ordinary (2008) Critical Studies in Media Communication, 25 (5), pp. 447-465; Licoppe, C., Inada, Y., Emergent uses of a multiplayer location-aware mobile game: The interactional consequences of mediated encounters (2006) Mobilities, 1 (1), pp. 39-61; (2016) How is Pokémon Go collecting data on its uers, , http://cds.nyu.edu/pokemon-go-collecting-data-users/, Retrieved fro; Peterson, A., Pokémon Go had “full access” to the Google accounts of some iPhone players (2016) The Washington Post, , https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2016/07/12/pokemon-go-had-full-access-to-the-google-accounts-of-some-iphone-players/, July, 13,.

These findings have led researchers to suggest that mobile phone use may pose a legitimately addictive behavior for some people. Other research has suggested negative effects of mobile phones on academic outcomes. To study the effects of phone separation on both anxiety and attainment of academic study goals, we randomly assigned participants (N = 93) to a restricted mobile phone access condition or a control condition. After setting a list of goals for a study session, participants worked on their own, self-chosen class materials for 60 minutes. Anxiety was measured before and immediately following the study session. Attainment of study goals was assessed through a self-report estimate of the percent of study goals accomplished at the end of the session. We predicted that those who classified as high on a problematic mobile phone use scale and who had their phones taken away would show the greatest increases in anxiety over the session as well as the greatest deficits in attainment of study goals as compared to all other participants. While there was a general tendency for participants who scored higher on the problematic use scale to be more anxious, anxiety did not differ between participants with phone access and those without it. Participants without phone access self-reported attainment of 12% more of their study goals than those who had phones. This study qualified the conditions for which restricting mobile phone access increases anxiety and provided further empirical support for detriments to attainment of study goals when mobile phones are present. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.","addiction; distraction; mobile phones; multitasking",,,,,,,,,"Adler, R.F., Benbunan-Fich, R., Self-interruptions in discretionary multitasking (2013) Computers in Human Behavior, 29 (4), pp. 1441-1449; Anderson, M., Technical report published by the Pew Research Center (2015) Technology device ownership: 2015, , http://www.pewinternet.org/2015/10/29/technology-device-ownership-2015/, ).

The significance of this novel device (within popular children’s culture at least) is open to question however. The workings of imagination in children’s lives have always populated mundane experience with nonactual actions and characters, and these processes have been mechanized and monetized by commercial children’s culture over decades, not least in the transmedia system of Pokémon itself. What can critical attention to imagination and technology in pre- and postdigital play tell us about the hybrid realities of Pokémon GO today? © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.","children’s mobile media; distributed imagination; everyday technoculture; Pokémon GO; postdigital play",,,,,,,,,"Alcock, S., Young children’s playfully complex communication: Distributed imagination (2010) European Early Childhood Education Research Journal, 18 (2), pp. 215-228; Bateson, G., (2000) Steps to an ecology of mind, , Chicago, IL, Chicago University Press,.

Pokémon GO is part of a new wave of phenomena that are about to change that situation. As a location-based game, it encourages people to play digital games out in the open, visiting public places. The ludic mindset and playful practices first developed while interacting with Pokémon GO may provide a basis for more complex skill sets and cultural practices that will be needed in broader cultural ludification developments, and for the next steps of entering the Ludic Society. The phenomenal success of Pokémon GO also highlights the importance of the meaningfully implemented links between technology, gaming content, and culture. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.","game cultures; Ludic Society; ludification; play; playfulness; Pokémon GO",,,,,,,,,"Ekman, I., Ermi, L., Lahti, J., Nummela, J., Lankoski, P., Mäyrä, F., (2005) Designing sound for a pervasive mobile game, pp. 110-116. , ACE ‘05 – Proceedings of the 2005 ACM SIGCHI International Conference on Advances in Computer Entertainment Technology, New York, NY, ACM, (; Florida, R.L., (2004) The rise of the creative class: And how it’s transforming work, leisure, community and everyday life, , New York, NY, Basic Boo; Haworth, J.T., Veal, A.J., (2004) Work and leisure, , London, UK, Routledge, (Eds; Lankoski, P., Heliö, S., Nummela, J., Lahti, J., Mäyrä, F., Ermi, L., (2004) A case study in pervasive game design: The Songs of North, pp. 413-416. , Proceedings of the third Nordic Conference on Human–Computer Interaction, New York, NY, ACM, (; Mäyrä, F., Lankoski, P., Play in a hybrid reality: Alternative approaches into game design (2009) Digital cityscapes: Merging digital and urban playspaces, pp. 129-147. , de Souza, Sutko, (eds), New York, NY, Peter Lang,.

This study attempts to tease out some of these differences through multiple analytical strategies and samples. Drawing on theoretical expectations about the affordances, motivations, and cognition of mobile use, we investigate who uses mobile Facebook, why they use it, and how they use it. To do this, we first compare those who use Facebook only on a PC with those who also use the service on mobile devices. Then, in order to quantify mobile Facebook use, we propose a new set of survey measures to tap into more and less mobile users among the sample of people who access Facebook through multiple modes. These questions serve to validate measures of mobile Facebook use, and allow us to examine how patterns of use relate to user motivations and experiences. Findings revealed important differences between PC-only and mobile users as well as a distinct and reliable measure of mobileness. Whereas motivations for Facebook use did not differ across users, more habitual and absorbing use of Facebook was strongly, positively associated with mobile practices. These findings illustrate that people use mobile Facebook in more automatic and immersive ways that are independent of overall frequency of use or motivations. Implications for the psychological mechanisms involved in mobile communication, as well as survey measurement of social media use, are discussed. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.","demographic differences; habits; immersion; measurement; mobile Facebook; motivations; national sample; social media use",,,,,,,,,"Abeele, M.V., Beullens, K., Roe, K., Measuring mobile phone use: Gender, age and real usage level in relation to the accuracy and validity of self-reported mobile phone use (2013) Mobile Media & Communication, 1 (2), pp. 213-236; Baron, N.S., Hard af Segerstad, Y., Cross-cultural patterns in mobile-phone use: Public space and reachability in Sweden, the USA and Japan (2010) New Media & Society, 12 (1), pp. 13-34; Bayer, J.B., Campbell, S.W., Texting while driving on automatic: Considering the frequency-independent side of habit (2012) Computers in Human Behavior, 28 (6), pp. 2083-2090; Bayer, J.B., Campbell, S.W., Ling, R., Connection cues: Activating the norms and habits of social connectedness (2016) Communication Theory, 26 (2), pp. 128-149; Bayer, J.B., Dal Cin, S., Campbell, S.W., Panek, E., Consciousness and self-regulation in mobile communication (2016) Human Communication Research, 42 (1), pp. 71-97; Bayer, J.B., Ellison, N., Schoenebeck, S., Brady, E., Falk, E.B., Facebook in context(s): Measuring emotional responses across time and space New Media & Society, , in pres; Blumler, J.G., Katz, E., Blumler, J.G., (1974) The uses of mass communications: Current perspectives on gratifications research, 3. , Beverly Hills, CA, SAG; Bode, L., Facebooking it to the polls: A study in online social networking and political behavior (2012) Journal of Information Technology & Politics, 9 (4), pp. 352-369; boyd, D.M., Ellison, N.B., Social network sites: Definition, history, and scholarship (2007) Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication, 13 (1), pp. 210-230; Burchell, K., Tasking the everyday: Where mobile and online communication take time (2015) Mobile Media & Communication, 3, pp. 36-52; Campbell, S.W., Perceptions of mobile phone use in public settings: A cross-cultural comparison (2007) International Journal of Communication, 1 (1). , http://ijoc.org/index.php/ijoc/article/view/169, ).

The research indicates that the introduction of mobile telecommunications has generally been viewed positively, with mobile phones affording social interaction with loved ones. Nonetheless, negative concerns have been strongly felt, notably financial costs and anxiety about mobile phones aiding in the coordination of extramarital liaisons and criminal activities. The communities investigated previously had scant access to modern communication technologies, some still using traditional means such as wooden slit drums, known locally as garamuts. The expansion of mobile network coverage has introduced into communal village life the capability to communicate dyadically and privately at a distance. Investigation into the adoption of mobile phones thus promotes understanding about traditional means of communication and notions of public and private interactions. © The Author(s) 2015.","Adoption; Cell phone; Communication; Drum; Early adoption; Marriage; Melanesia; Mobile phone; Nokia; Pacific; Papua New Guinea; Private; Public; Rural; Slit gong; Social",,,,,,,,,"Aakhus, M., Understanding information and communication technology and infrastructure in everyday life: Struggling with communication-at-a-distance (2003) Machines that Become Us: The Social Context of Personal Communication Technology, pp. 27-42. , J.

This case study examines one of those challenges: creating a strategically ambiguous mobile device use policy to combat misuse in an organization. We use focus group data collection and a subsequent constant comparative analysis to examine a U.S. company with an organizational policy selectively restricting mobile device access for nonmanagerial workers. The findings and resulting theoretical model reflect the tension employees face when interpreting a restrictive mobile device use policy within the context of mobile use as “taken for granted.” This tension is manifest through four unintended consequences of the strategically ambiguous policy: (a) declining productivity, (b) supervisors burdened by overwhelming tasks, (c) decreased professional mobility, and (d) fleeting organizational identification. This research offers an organizational contribution to the current work on mobiles and it provides insight into how nonmanagerial workers interpret and act when a mobile use policy is strategically ambiguous. © The Author(s) 2015.","ICTs; Labor work; Mobile devices; Organizational identification; Organizational policy; Strategic ambiguity",,,,,,,,,"Annafari, M.T., Axelsson, A.S., Bohlin, E., A socio-economic exploration of mobile phone service have-nots in Sweden (2014) New Media & Society, 16, pp. 415-433; Ashforth, B.E., Mael, F., Social identity theory and the organization (1989) Academy of Management Review, 14, pp. 20-39; Campbell, S.W., Park, Y.J., Social implications of mobile telephony: The rise of personal communication society (2008) Sociology Compass, 2, pp. 321-387; Carmeli, A., Gilat, G., Waldman, D.A., The role of perceived organizational performance in organizational identification, adjustment and job performance (2007) Journal of Management Studies, 44, pp. 972-992; Chapelle, C., (2003) English Language Learning and Technology: Lectures on Applied Linguistics in the Age of Information and Communication Technology, 7. , Philadelphia, PA: John Benjamins; Charmaz, K., (2006) Constructing Grounded Theory: A Practical Guide through Qualitative Analysis, , Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage; Cheney, G., Christensen, L.T., Dailey, S.L., Communicating identity and identification in and around organizations (2013) The Sage Handbook of Organizational Communication: Advances in Theory, Research, and Methods, pp. 695-716. , L.

It argues that full-time access to peers—which interviewees identify as the main consequence of smartphones and instant messaging apps on their interactions with friends—is a communicative affordance, that is, a set of socially constructed opportunities and constraints that frame possibilities of action by giving rise to a diversity of communicative practices, as well as contradictory feelings among young people: intimacy, proximity, security as well as anxiety, exclusion and obligation. Understanding the perceptions and emotions around the affordance of “anywhere, anytime” accessibility, therefore, helps in untangling how communicative affordances are individually perceived but also, and more importantly, socially appropriated, negotiated, legitimised, and institutionalised. © The Author(s) 2016.","Children and young people; Communicative affordances; Emotions; Perpetual contact; Smartphones",,,,,,,,,"Baron, N., (2008) Always On: Language in an Online and Mobile World, , New York, NY: Oxford University Press; Bertel, T., Ling, R., Its just not that exciting anymore”: The changing centrality of SMS in the everyday lives of young Danes (2014) New Media and Society, 18, pp. 1293-1309; Bertel, T., Stald, G., From SMS to SNS: The use of the Internet on the mobile phone among young Danes (2013) Mobile Media Practices, Presence and Politics.

And yet, despite the influence of mobile media in and around art, the notion of “mobile art” or “mobile media art” remains relatively undertheorized and discussed. So what constitutes mobile art? Is it defined by a mobile interface in the process or delivery of the artwork? Or is it defined by a relationship to mobile content or context? Located in and around the field of mobile communication, mobile art has often been sublimated with locative, hybrid, mixed reality, or media arts. This paper argues for an understanding of mobile art as a broader field of creative practice than just locative media practice or media arts. Rather than survey all the examples of mobile art on offer today, this paper will structure mobile art into key three thematic rubrics: intimate copresence, emplaced visuality, ambient play. © The Author(s) 2015.","Ambient play; Camera phones; Mobile art; Mobile media; Mobile movies",,,,,,,,,"Benford, S., Brown, C., Reynard, G., Greenhalgh, C., Shared spaces: Transportation, artificiality, and spatiality (1996) CSCW ’96.

We investigate whether an aesthetization of mobile design is taking place and, if so, how it is being pursued through institutional practices in organizations. We conduct a visual analysis of all Nokia phone releases between 1992 and 2013 complemented by an interview series with key actors. The study reveals a continuous increase in aesthetic variation between 1998 and 2008, which is visible in the variation of colors, forms, and materials. The period between 2003 and 2008, which we term the “Grand” period, marks the peak of aesthetization of Nokia’s devices. It exhibits great variation, and is visibly similar to aesthetics in the fashion industry. With the introduction of the slate form, we see a decrease in visual variation between 2009 and 2013. The interviews reveal how the visual design was driven by organizational strategies, such as customer segmentation in general, and an orientation toward the fashion industry, for example, in the creation of a fashion segment. The study reveals how aesthetic variation is weaved into a complex innovation system with sometimes conflicting demands deriving from, for instance, technology and user interaction. © The Author(s) 2016.","Aesthetization; Fashion; Mobile phone design; Nokia; Periodization; Visual variation",,,,,,,,,"Abeele, M.M.P.V., Mobile youth culture: A conceptual development (2016) Mobile Media & Communication, 4 (1), pp. 85-101; Atkinson, P., Computer memories: The history of computer form (1998) History and Technology, 15 (1-2), pp. 89-120; Baumgarten, A.G., (2007) Aesthetica/Ästhetik, , (D.

We conducted semistructured interviews with 25 transnational migrants recently relocated to the greater New York City area, investigating their day-to-day smartphone use, navigation tactics, and uses of location-based services. Our analysis reflects on three themes: tensions surrounding different navigation strategies (searching vs. browsing); social monitoring practices (awareness vs. surveillance); and perceptions of online information sources (credibility/trust vs. distrust). Together, these themes highlight the contradictory outcomes of technology use both facilitating and hindering the processes of urban learning. We conclude with a discussion of paradoxical outcomes of technological use as a means of unpacking the sociotechnical tensions that emerge from locative technology use among transnational migrants in new urban environments. © The Author(s) 2015.","Information behavior; Locative technology; Migrant; Social media; Urban learning",,,,,,,,,"Bates, M.J., The design of browsing and berrypicking techniques for the online search interface (1989) Online Review, 13 (5), pp. 407-424; Bilandzic, M., Foth, M., A review of locative media, mobile, and embodied spatial interaction (2012) International Journal of Human-Computer Studies, 70 (1), pp. 66-71; Bilandzic, M., Foth, M., De Luca, A., CityFlocks: Designing social navigation for urban mobile information systems (2008) Proceedings of the 7Th ACM Conference on Designing Interactive Systems, pp. 174-183. , Cape Town, South Africa, New York, NY: ACM; Braun, V., Clarke, V., Using thematic analysis in psychology (2006) Qualitative Research in Psychology, 3, pp. 77-101; Caidi, N., Allard, D., Quirke, L., The information practices of immigrants (2010) Annual Review of Information Science and Technology, 44, pp. 493-531; Castells, M., Fernandez-Ardevol, M., Qiu, J.L., Sey, A., (2007) Mobile Communication and Society: A Global Perspective, , Cambridge, MA: MIT Press; Corbin, J., Strauss, A., (2008) Basics of Qualitative Research: Techniques and Procedures for Developing Grounded Theory, , Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage; De Certeau, M., (1988) The Practice of Everyday Life, , Los Angeles: University of California Press; De Souzae Silva, A., Location-aware mobile technologies: Historical, social, and spatial approaches (2013) Mobile Media & Communication, 1 (1), pp. 116-121; De Souzae Silva, A., Frith, J., Locative mobile social networks: Mapping communication and location in urban spaces (2010) Mobilities, 5 (4), pp. 485-505; Fisher, K., Durrance, J., Bouch Hinton, M., Information grounds and the use of need-based services by immigrants in Queens, New York: A context-based, outcome evaluation approach (2004) Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology, 55 (8), pp. 754-766; Foth, M., Choi, J.H., Satchell, C., Urban informatics (2011) Proceedings of the ACM Conference on Computer Supported Cooperative Work, pp. 1-8. , Hangzhou, China: ACM; Frith, J., Splintered space: Hybrid spaces and differential mobility (2012) Mobilities, 7, pp. 131-149; Frith, J., Turning life into a game: Foursquare, gamification, and personal mobility (2013) Mobile Media & Communication, 1, pp. 248-262; Frith, J., Communicating through location: The understood meaning of the Foursquare check-in (2014) Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication, 19, pp. 890-905; Frith, J., (2015) Smartphones as Locative Media, , Cambridge, UK: Polity; Goldman, E., (2005) Search Engine Bias and the Demise of Search Engine Utopianism, , http://ssrn.com/abstract=893892, Yale Journal of Law & Technology; Gordon, E., De Souzae Silva, A., (2011) Net Locality: Why Location Matters in a Networked World, , Malden, MA: Wiley-Blackwell; Graham, S., Marvin, S., (2001) Splintering Urbanism: Networked Infrastructures, Technological Mobilities and the Urban Condition, , London, UK: Psychology Press; Humphreys, L., Mobile social networks and social practice: A case study of Dodgeball (2008) Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication, 13, pp. 341-360; Humphreys, L., Liao, T., Mobile geotagging: Reexamining our interactions with urban space (2011) Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication, 16, pp. 407-423; Introna, L.D., Nissenbaum, H., Shaping the Web: Why the politics of search engines matters (2000) The Information Society, 16, pp. 169-185; Komito, L., Social media and migration: Virtual community 2.0 (2011) Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology, 62 (6), pp. 1075-1086; Licoppe, C., Guillot, R., ICTs and the engineering of encounters: A case study of the development of a mobile game based on the geolocation of terminals (2006) Mobile Technologies of the City, pp. 152-176. , M.

This paper explores the affordances and constraints of this dynamics for global health in low-and middle-income countries (LMICs). In these settings, research and practice have focused on one-or two-way communication designs and on approaches that position health workers as passive actors. To extend current views, three domains of mobile social media usage are theorized: (a) sociocognitive learning; (b) Sociocultural professional participation; and (c) Concertive peer and multistakeholder control. The theoretical discussion is illustrated with empirical examples from a nonsystematic literature review to account for the wide and interdisciplinary problem space. In the second part of this analysis, suggestions are discussed regarding how to anchor and facilitate mobile social media spaces within existing institutional structures. Finally, this paper argues that leveraging the affordances of mobile social-media-based communication requires the consideration of several constraints and challenges, including the economics of participation, privacy and surveillance, regulation and information quality, equal sociocultural participation, and technical competencies and professionalism. © The Author(s) 2015.","Health; LMIC; M-health; Mobile communication; Mobile phone; Social media; Social networks",,,,,,"P2ZHP1_155026","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/ or publication of this article: The authors are grateful for the support provided by the Swiss National Science FoundationSNF (Grant P2ZHP1_155026)",,"Abdul, S.S., Lin, C.W., Scholl, J., Fernandez-Luque, L., Jian, W.S., Hsu, M.H., Li, Y.C., Facebook use leads to health-care reform in Taiwan (2011) The Lancet, 377 (9783), pp. 2083-2084; Bandura, A., Human agency in social cognitive theory (1989) American Psychologist, 44 (9), pp. 1175-1184; Barker, J.R., Tightening the iron cage: Concertive control in self-managing teams (1993) Administrative Science Quarterly, 38 (3), pp. 408-437; Beer, D., Social network(Ing) sites… revisiting the story so far: A response to Danah Boyd & Nicole Ellison (2008) Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication, 13 (2), pp. 516-529; Berle, I., Clinical photography and patient rights: The need for orthopraxy (2008) Journal of Medical Ethics, 34 (2), pp. 89-92; Blaschke, S., Bokenkamp, K., Cosmaciuc, R., Denby, M., Hailu, B., Short, R., Using mobile phones to improve child nutrition surveillance in Malawi (2009) UNICEF Malawi and UNICEF Innovations, , https://sipa.columbia.edu/sites/default/files/UNICEFFinalReport_2009_0.pdf; Boyd, D., Ellison, N.B., Social network sites: Definition, history, and scholarship (2007) Journal of Computer Mediated Communication, 13 (1), pp. 210-230; Braun, R., Catalani, C., Wimbush, J., Israelski, D., Community health workers and mobile technology: A systematic review of the literature (2013) Plos One, 8 (6); Brinkerhoff, D.W., Accountability and health systems: Toward conceptual clarity and policy relevance (2004) Health Policy and Planning, 19 (6), pp. 371-379; Brown, A.D., Social media: A new frontier in reflective practice (2010) Medical Education, 44 (8), pp. 744-745; Brysiewicz, P., Pimmer, C., Chipps, J., Walters, F., Linxen, S., Gröhbiel, U., Mobile phones as learning tools (2014) Paper Presented at the 20Th Annual Qualitative Health Research Conference, , British Columbia, Canada; Cassaniti, J., Mwaikambo, L., Shore, R., Evolution of Facebook groups: Informal e-learning among medical laboratory scientists in Nigeria (2014) Knowledge Management & E-Learning, 6 (3), pp. 250-261; (2015) Pew Research Center, , http://www.pewglobal.org/2015/04/15/cell-phones-in-africa-communication-lifeline/; Chib, A., The Aceh Besar midwives with mobile phones project: Design and evaluation perspectives using the information and communication technologies for healthcare development model (2010) Journal of Computer Mediated Communication, 15 (3), pp. 500-525; Chib, A., The promise and peril of mHealth in developing countries (2013) Mobile Media & Communication, 1 (1), pp. 69-75; Chib, A., Chen, V.H., Midwives with mobiles: A dialectical perspective on gender arising from technology introduction in rural Indonesia (2011) New Media & Society, 13 (3), pp. 486-501; Chib, A., Phuong, T.K., Si, C.W., Hway, N.S., Enabling informal digital guanxi for rural doctors in Shaanxi, China (2013) Chinese Journal of Communication, 6 (1), pp. 62-80; Chib, A., Van Velthoven, M., Car, J., MHealth adoption in low-resource environments: A review of the use of mobile healthcare in developing countries (2014) Journal of Health Communication, 20 (1), pp. 4-34; Chou, W.-Y.S., Prestin, A., Lyons, C., Wen, K.-Y., Web 2.0 for health promotion: Reviewing the current evidence (2013) American Journal of Public Health, 103 (1), pp. ee9-e18; Cook, D.A., West, C.P., Conducting systematic reviews in medical education: A stepwise approach (2012) Medical Education, 46 (10), pp. 943-952; Cook, J., Pachler, N., Bachmair, B., Using social network sites and mobile technology to scaffold equity of access to cultural resources (2013) Using Network and Mobile Technology to Bridge Formal and Informal Learning, pp. 31-56. , G.

As the first mobile electronic device, the portable radio reveals important information about how the mobile media experience has developed over time. Portable radio afforded several new experiences that are relevant to today’s media landscape: it allowed users to create customizable, mobile media environments that they could take with them wherever they went; it redefined the radio listening context by allowing users to bring their preferred forms of entertainment with them when travelling to unfamiliar places; and it facilitated more continuous media consumption habits. This interdisciplinary essay combines close textual analysis of historical newspaper articles and advertisements, which are viewed through the lens of a range of media theories. The goal is to uncover some of the complex effects of early mobile media and to lay the groundwork for future in-depth studies of mobile media history. © The Author(s) 2016.","Media effects; Media history; Mobile media; Portability; Radio",,,,,,,,,"(1939) New York Times, 8p. , October 21; Bogost, I., (2011) How to Do Things with Videogames, , St. Paul: University of Minnesota Press; Briggs, A., Burke, P., (2009) A Social History of the Media: From Gutenberg to the Internet, , 3rd ed.).

This paper examines the domestication of smartphones by looking at how the way we use mobile applications affects our everyday routines. Data is collected through an innovative quantitative mixed-method approach, combining log data from smartphones and survey (perception) data. We find that there are dimensions of domestication that explain how the use of smartphones affects our daily routines. Contributions are stronger for downloaded applications than for native applications. Especially applications that require interaction with others, such as social media and instant messaging, have a serious impact on our day-to-day routines. As a result, appropriation is core in incorporating smartphones in daily life routines. However, frequency of use and the total number of minutes spent on a given type of application per day affect our everyday routines in different ways. This paper is the first quantitative domestication study that focuses on smartphones rather than feature phones. The theoretical contribution and practical implications are outlined. © The Author(s) 2016.","Domestication theory; Mobile applications; Mobile communication; Mobile media; Smartphone",,,,,,,,,"Arnold, M., On the phenomenology of technology: The “Janus-faces” of mobile phones (2003) Information and Organization, 13 (4), pp. 231-256; Bergman, S., Communication technology in the household: The gendering of artefacts and practices (1994) Gender, Icts and Everyday Life: Mutual Shaping Processes, pp. 135-153. , V.

Conducting an explorative study among market women in Kampala, the aim is to examine what roles (if any) the mobile phone plays for them in terms of empowerment. Our findings resonate with studies from other parts of the world, suggesting that while pivotal for their business endeavors, mobile phone practices are also embedded in patriarchal structures. By discussing how these market women navigate the tensions between using the phone for their business and in relations to their partners, the article contributes a more nuanced and context-specific understanding of mobile phone practices and the empowerment of market women. We conclude the article by suggesting a situated approach to the study of empowerment. © The Author(s) 2015.","Development; Empowerment; Gender; Informal economy; Kampala; M4D; Market women; Mobile phones; Uganda",,,,,,,,,"Aker, J.C., Does digital divide or provide?

It analyses the experiences of 25 Spanishspeaking young adults recently arrived in London through a qualitative methodological lens based on semistructured interviews and participant observation at relevant sites of arrival in the city. We looked at the potential mobile phones have to empower youth in their migration processes—from improving their transnational communication to accessing relevant and timely information at destination—as well as the challenges young migrants face to fully enjoy mobile services in a new national context. We argue that this tension between the potential benefits and challenges of mobile communication is particularly prominent when arriving at a new place, a moment characterized by economic and emotional uncertainties. However, this temporal dimension has tended to remain underexplored in the literature that deals with mobile communication and users’ strategies. Thus we propose the concept of “immigrants’ technological adjustments” to name the set of decisions immigrants take as information and communication technologies (ICTs) users in order to ensure the availability of digital resources and services while moving between countries. We draw upon empirical examples from fieldwork in order to offer a new conceptual tool that further develops the burgeoning field of immigrants and ICT use. © The Author(s) 2016.","Immigration; Intra-European mobility; London; Mobile phones; Technological adjustments; Young adult Spaniards",,,,,,"288587, FP7/2007-2013","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: The research leading to these results has received funding from the European Community?s Seventh Framework ProgrammeFP7 (FP7/2007-2013) under Grant Agreement No. 288587 MASELTOV.

Employing usage variety as an indicator, this study explores levels of mobile phone incorporation among older users, based on an online cross-European survey of 1,039 individuals aged 60 and up. Results displayed a four-level pyramid structure of mobile phone incorporation with voice calling at its base, proceeding through basic functions and Internet-based functions to media player at its apex. The two upper levels were negatively associated with reported “old” media use (e.g., television, radio) and positively correlated with use of more advanced technology-based media. Younger age, higher education and income, work force participation, and residence in Italy or Israel predicted higher levels of mobile phone incorporation. The findings suggested that the incorporation phase of mobile phone domestication by older Internet users comprises various subphases and that level of incorporation depends on one’s personal and cultural background. Furthermore, results demonstrated that mobile phones replace old media to some extent and complement the use of other new media. © The Author(s) 2015.","Cross-national study; Media displacement; Mobile/cell phones; Old age; Technology Domestication",,,,,,,,,"Al-Razgan, M.S., Al-Khalifa, H.S., Al-Shahrani, M.D., Al-Ajmi, H.H., Touch-based mobile phone interface guidelines and design recommendations for elderly people: A survey of the literature (2012) Neural Information Processing.

However, this is not true for every app, with some apps receiving millions of downloads, while other apps are mostly ignored. We investigate the popularity of apps in terms of downloads by focusing on two salient cues: (a) online recommendations (e.g., presence and valence of online reviews) and (b) visual characteristics of app icons (e.g., use of visual metaphors and anthropomorphism). Study 1 was a field study in which we content-analyzed 500 apps from the “transportation” subcategory of the Google Play Store. We found that the presence and valence of online reviews, as well as the presence of visual metaphors in app icons were positively related to the number of app downloads. Study 2 was an experiment in which we presented participants with different app icons containing different types of visual metaphors. We again found that app icons with visual metaphors led to more positive attitudes towards the apps and behavioral intentions. Combined, our studies show that both online consumers (through online reviews) and app designers (through visual design) impact an app’s popularity. © The Author(s) 2016.","App stores; Mobile apps; Mobility behavior; Online reviews; Visual design; Visual metaphor",,,,,,"Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek, NWO: 314-98-002","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/ or publication of this article: The contributions of Christian Burgers and Allison Eden were supported by the Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (Creative Industries/KIEM Grant 314-98-002, www.nwo.nl).",,"Bolognesi, M., Van Den Heerik, R.A.M., Van Der Berg, E., VisMet: An online corpus of visual metaphors (2016) Manuscript under Review; Bowdle, B.F., Gentner, D., The career of metaphor (2005) Psychological Review, 112 (1), pp. 193-216; Buell, R.W., Norton, M.I., The labor illusion: How operational transparency increases perceived value (2011) Management Science, 57 (9), pp. 1564-1579; Burgers, C., Konijn, E.A., Steen, G.J., Iepsma, M.A.R., Making ads less complex, yet more creative and persuasive: The effects of conventional metaphors and irony in print advertising (2015) International Journal of Advertising, 34 (3), pp. 515-532; Chevalier, J.A., Mayzlin, D., The effect of word of mouth on sales: Online book reviews (2006) Journal of Marketing Research, 43 (3), pp. 345-354; Chittaro, L., Sioni, R., Evaluating mobile apps for breathing training: The effectiveness of visualization (2014) Computers in Human Behavior, 40, pp. 56-63; Delbaere, M., McQuarrie, E.F., Phillips, B.J., Personification in advertising (2011) Journal of Advertising, 40 (1), pp. 121-130; Dogruel, L., Joeckel, S., Bowman, N.D., Choosing the right app: An exploratory perspective on heuristic decision processes for smartphone app selection (2015) Mobile Media & Communication, 3 (1), pp. 125-144; Dou, X., Walden, J.A., Lee, S., Lee, J.Y., Does source matter?

It introduced a new competitor—Digicel—into the market, privatised the state-owned company SamoaTel (now Bluesky Samoa) and established an independent regulator. These reforms have had a dramatic impact on mobile usage in Samoa, and now mobile phones and regular Internet access have become an everyday (and affordable) reality for a vast majority of the population. This paper provides a critical account of one of the most mature mobile markets in the Pacific region. Drawing on semistructured key informant interviews with individuals in the Samoan telecommunications sector and the public service (conducted in April 2014), the paper explores the emergence of a Samoan digital culture, a transformation which has only been possible thanks to the widespread take up of mobile phones on 3G networks. We outline how mobiles are being used in Samoa, the ways in which they integrate (or don’t) wiThexisting social and cultural norms and discuss the wider infrastructural issues that have emerged in light of this increased usage. We end by reflecting on what the Samoan experience can tell us about telecommunications reform in developing countries more generally. © The Author(s) 2016.","Development; Media regulation; Mobile communication; Samoa; Telecommunications reform",,,,,,,,,"Cave, D., (2012) Digital Islands: How the Pacific’s ICT Revolution is Transforming the Region, , Sidney, Australia: Lowy Institute for International Policy Report; Donner, J., Research approaches to mobile use in the developing world: A review of the literature (2008) The Information Society, 24 (3), pp. 140-159; Doron, A., Jeffrey, R., (2013) The Great Indian Phone Book: How the Cheap Cell Phone Changes Business, Politics and Everyday Life, , Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press; Favaro, E., Halewood, N., Rossotto, C., From monopoly to competition: Reform of Samoa’s telecommunications sector (2008) Small States, Smart Solutions: Improving Connectivity and Increasing the Effectiveness of Public Services, pp. 215-242. , E.

Instagram had no dedicated advertising or analytics tools until 2014 so, in the absence of such devices, brands have developed uses of the platform that engage with the productive ability of cultural intermediaries and consumers to create and circulate images of their bodies, everyday lives, and cultural practices. This article examines the Instagram activities of the global vodka brand Smirnoff and the fashion retailer General Pants. Each brand engages with cultural intermediaries and builds themed activations at cultural events to orchestrate the production of images. Following Wissinger’s (2007a) study of fashion models, we conceptualize Instagram as an image machine that captures and calibrates attention. Instagram expands the terrain upon which brands operate by dispersing the work of creating and engaging with images into consumers’ everyday lives. The efforts made by brands to experiment with mobile media demonstrate the need to critically examine how participatory, discursive, and algorithmic modes of control are interrelated. © 2015, © The Author(s) 2015.","Branding; images; Instagram; mobile media platforms; smartphones; social media",,,,,,,,,"Andrejevic, M., The work of being watched: Interactive media and the exploitation of self-disclosure (2002) Critical Studies in Media Communication, 19 (2), pp. 230-248; Banet-Weiser, S., (2012) Authentic TM: The politics and ambivalence in a brand culture, , New York, NY, New York University Press; Carah, N., Breaking into the bubble: Brand-building labour and “getting in” to the culture industry (2011) Continuum: Journal of Media & Cultural Studies, 25 (3), pp. 427-438; Carah, N., Watching nightlife: Affective labor, social media, and surveillance (2013) Television & New Media, 15 (3), pp. 250-265; Carah, N., Brodmerkel, S., Hernandez, L., Brands and sociality alcohol branding, drinking culture and Facebook (2014) Convergence: The International Journal of Research into New Media Technologies, 20 (3), pp. 259-275; Clough, P., The affective turn: Introduction (2007) The affective turn: Theorizing the social, pp. 1-33. , Clough, Halley, (eds), Durham, NC, Duke University Press,.

This study finds that WeChat’s wide functionality enabled multimodal communication in varying situations.

This article argues that it is in the negotiation of contact during hookups that college students creatively navigate their sexual identity. Using a mixed methodology, this research reveals that the cell phone, as both an object of communication and consumption, is essential to the formation of self, and, as such, it provides the means by which men and women can play with gender boundaries. And yet, the male dominated fraternity system at college restricts the ability of women to realize full agency within the hookup scene. © 2015, © The Author(s) 2015.","Cell phone; college; fraternity; gender; hookup; sex",,,,,,,,,"Afifi, W.A., Faulkner, S.L., On being “just friends”: The frequency and impact of sexual activity in cross-sex friendships (2000) Journal of Social and Personal Relationships, 17 (2), pp. 205-222; Ahuvia, A.C., Beyond the extended self: Loved objects and consumers’ identity narratives (2005) Journal of Consumer Research, 32, pp. 171-184; Bauman, Z., (2003) Liquid life, , Cambridge, UK, Polity Press; Bogle, K.A., (2008) Hooking up: Sex, dating and relationships on campus, , New York, NY, New York University Press; Bordo, S., (1993) Unbearable weight: Feminism, Western culture, and the body, , Berkeley, University of California Press; Bordo, S., Reading the male body (1997) Building bodies, pp. 31-73. , Moore, (ed), New Brunswick, NJ, Rutgers University Press,.

Given the prevalence of mobile technology and that noise sensitivity appears to be a relatively stable individual difference, it is possible that noise sensitivity may distinguish individual mobile phone use. This study investigates the relationship between noise sensitivity and mobile phone attitudes and behaviors. Study results suggest that noise sensitive bystanders find mobile phone conversations more annoying, that they differ in their assessment of the distraction level of ambient noise when making and receiving calls, are more likely to report mobile phones as distracting, and are more likely to seek privacy from others when receiving a call. © 2015, © The Author(s) 2015.","Listening; mobile phone noise; mobile phone privacy; noise sensitivity; sensory processing sensitivity",,,,,,,,,"Aron, E.N., (1996) The highly sensitive person, , New York, NY, Broadway; Aron, E.N., Aron, A., Sensory-processing sensitivity and its relation to introversion and emotionality (1997) Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 73, pp. 345-368. , 10.1037/ 0022–3514.73.2.345; Baird, J.C., Harder, K., Preis, A., Annoyance and community noise: A psychophysical model of dose-response relationships (1997) Journal of Environmental Psychology, 17, pp. 333-343; Banjo, O., Hu, Y., Sundar, S., Cell phone usage and social interaction with proximate others: Ringing in a theoretical model (2008) The Open Communication Journal, 2, pp. 127-135; Benfield, J.A., Nurse, G.A., Jakubowski, R., Gibson, A.W., Taff, B.D., Newman, P., Bell, P.A., Testing noise in the field: A brief measure of individual noise sensitivity (2012) Environment and Behavior, 46, pp. 353-372; Byrne, B.M., (2010) Structural equation modeling with AMOS, , 2nd ed., Ottawa, Caa, Routledge; Campbell, S.W., Perceptions of mobile phone use in public settings: A cross-cultural comparison (2007) International Journal of Communication, 1, pp. 738-757. , 1932–8036/20070738; Cegala, D.J., Interaction involvement: A cognitive dimension of communicative competence (1981) Communication Education, 30, pp. 109-121; (2005) Research on research (r2), , http://digitalunion.osu.edu/r2/node/15, Retrieved from; Cocker, D.A., Burgoon, J., The nature of conversational involvement and nonverbal encoding patterns (1987) Human Communication Research, 13, pp. 463-494; Cohen, J., (1988) Statistical power analysis for the behavioral sciences, , 2nd ed., Hillsdale, NJ, Erlbaum; Ellermeier, W., Eigenstetter, M., Zimmer, K., Psychoacoustic correlates of individual noise sensitivity (2001) Journal of the Acoustical Society of America, 109, pp. 1464-1473; Faul, F., Erdfelder, E., Lang, A.-G., Buchner, A., G*Power 3: A flexible statistical power analysis program for the social, behavioral, and biomedical sciences (2007) Behavior Research Methods, 39, pp. 175-191; Gearhart, C.C., (2012) Communicating while stimulated: The effects of sensory-processing sensitivity on behavior and relationships, , http://etd.lsu.edu/docs/available/etd-04262012–150423/unrestricted/ChristopherGearhartFinalCopy.pdf, Louisiana State University and Agricultural and Mechanical College, (Doctoral dissertation).,.

The rapid growth of app-centric media, we argue, is directly dependent on the development and commercialization of the (mobile) Internet, as well as on the business models embedded in the development of key native app platforms such as iOS and Android. The emergence of app-centric media, particularly in relation to mobile media, is having a marked effect on conceptualizations of the Web. The prevailing rhetoric concerning the development of the mobile Internet and app-centric media employs imagery of autonomy, empowerment, and independence for both the users and producers of apps. We argue that the commoditization central to the commercial development of the mobile Internet evidences a fusion of neoliberal rhetoric valorizing worker autonomy, individual empowerment, and entrepreneurial independence, with a mode of production consonant with “cognitive capitalism” (Dyer-Witheford, 2014; Vercellone, 2007). Our analysis is divided into three sections. The first looks at the early development of the mobile Internet in relation to the accumulation strategies of cognitive capitalism including the structural importance of “value networks” and the “putting-out system”; the second deals with the commercialization models underpinning the two dominant app platforms, Apple’s iOS and Android; the third addresses the development of HTML as a means of production and describes how HTML5 is framed as a prospectively more “open” competitor to the existing platform duopoly. It concludes by briefly examining the development of the Firefox OS mobile platform—and whether this platform resists or incorporates the forms of commoditization associated with app-centric media generally. © 2015, © The Author(s) 2015.","App development; HTML5; mobile apps; mobile Internet; mobile media",,,,,,,,,"Anthes, G., HTML5 leads a web revolution (2012) Communications of the ACM, 55 (7), pp. 16-17; (2013) Annnual report 2013, , Washington, DC, Author; Berners-Lee, T., (2011) Long live the Web: A call for continued open standards and neutrality, , http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=long-live-the-web, Retrieved from; Berners-Lee, T., Connolly, D., (1993) Hypertext markup language (HTML): A representation of textual information and metainformation for retrieval and interchange, , http://tools.ietf.org/pdf/draft-ietf-iiir-html-00.pdf, Fremont, CA, Internet Engineering Task Force,.

In two studies, we first investigated the particular concerns associated with Grindr use. Results indicated that the unique affordances of Grindr generated six categories of user concerns associated with use of the mobile application. The second study confirmed that a specific set of user goals and concerns predicted daters’ desire for uncertainty, which in turn predicted information-seeking behavior. Findings clearly indicate that Grindr users’ responses to uncertainty were not limited to simple reduction strategies, but were dependent upon their desire for and tolerance of uncertainty in relation to their goals and concerns of application use. The current results also help to establish UMT’s predictive power and explanatory utility within the realm of interpersonal communication. © 2015, © The Author(s) 2015.","Grindr; information-seeking; location-based dating; online dating; uncertainty",,,,,,,,,"Afifi, W., Uncertainty and information management in interpersonal contexts (2010) New directions in interpersonal communication research, pp. 94-115. , Smith, Wilson, (eds), Thousand Oaks, CA, SAGE,.

Little attention, however, has been devoted to its theoretical foundations. Drawing from youth culture theory and new (mobile) media theories, this article conceptually develops mobile youth culture by (a) describing the commonalities in adolescent mobile phone use that constitute the culture, and by (b) discussing the origins of these commonalities through an analysis of the network, the social and personal logics inherent in mobile communication technology, and the way these are appropriated by youths to accommodate their transition to adulthood. The article concludes by pointing out the shortcomings of the concept: The limited attention for the heterogeneity in adolescent media use, the integration of mobile media technologies into young people’s media repertoires, the cross-generational implications of mobile media use, and the impact of local context and culture. © 2015, © The Author(s) 2015.","Adolescence; mobile media; mobile youth culture; socialization; youth culture",,,,,,,,,"Arnett, J.J., Adolescents’ use of media for self-socialization (1995) Journal of Youth and Adolescence, 24 (5), pp. 519-533; Arnett, J.J., (2010) Adolescence and emerging adulthood: A cultural approach, , 4th ed., Boston, MA, Prentice Hall; Axelsson, A., Perpetual and personal: Swedish young adults and their use of mobile phones (2010) New Media & Society, 12 (1), pp. 35-54; Baumeister, R.F., Muraven, M., Identity as adaptation to social, cultural, and historical context (1996) Journal of Adolescence, 19, pp. 405-416; Bennett, A., (2000) Popular music and youth culture: Music, identity and place, , Basingstoke, UK, MacMillan Press; Berger, B.M., Adolescence and beyond: An essay review of three books on the problems of growing up (The Adolescent Society by James Coleman; Growing Up Absurd by Paul Goodman; The Vanishing Adolescent by Edgar Z.

Development ICT4D India interactive voice response mobile participation We are grateful to Shubhranshu Choudhury, founder and moderator of CGNet Swara, who facilitated our fieldwork by making introductions to contacts in Chhattisgarh. We also thank Bill Thies, our colleague who cofounded CGNet Swara and coauthored earlier papers. Finally, though conditions of anonymity make it impossible to acknowledge them by name, the field visits would not have been possible without the support, hospitality, and generosity of numerous people in Chhattisgarh. Thanks are also due to the users of CGNet Swara, government officials of Chhattisgarh, and journalists who all readily granted time to discuss their views and provided further leads to make this study possible.

Mobile media can contribute to the existing ways of narrating places and the self because locational information can communicate multiple and different aspects of places. Situating our analysis within the broader literature on memory and media, we draw on three different studies conducted in the UK and the US in order to analyze different uses of mobile media in remembering associations with places, past experiences, and creating a nostalgic sense of place. More specifically we draw on notions of memory work and mediated memories to explore the mutual shaping of media, place, and memory.

Though public safety campaigns intended to curb dangerous texting behaviors have been implemented, relatively little is known about the psychological processes involved in these behaviors. Our study integrates emerging research on automatic behavior, self-control, and mindfulness in an attempt to explain why many individuals believe that such behavior is dangerous but engage in it anyway. Our survey study (N = 925) of college students (n = 313) and adults (n = 612) revealed that texting automaticity, trait self-control, and the “acting with awareness” facet of trait mindfulness were all uniquely predictive of texting while driving as well as texting while walking. Further, we observe that texting automaticity is more strongly related to the frequency of texting while walking than driving. Together, the findings synthesize disparate strands of research on cognition and media use and demonstrate the importance of distinguishing among types of consciousness to understanding mobile communication behavior. © 2015, © The Author(s) 2015.","Automaticity; mindfulness; mobile; self-control; texting; texting and driving",,,,,,,,,"Ajzen, I., Residual effects of past on later behavior: Habituation and reasoned action perspectives (2002) Personality and Social Psychology Review, 6 (2), pp. 107-122; Atchley, P., Atwood, S., Boulton, A., The choice to text and drive in younger drivers: Behavior shape attitude (2011) Accident Analysis & Prevention, 43 (1), pp. 134-142. , may; Baer, R.A., Mindfulness training as a clinical intervention: A conceptual and empirical review (2003) Clinical Psychology: Science and Practice, 10, pp. 125-143; Baer, R.A., Smith, G.T., Allen, K.B., Assessment of mindfulness by self-report: The Kentucky Inventory of Mindfulness Skills (2004) Assessment, 11 (3), pp. 191-206; Bargh, J.A., Chartrand, T.L., The unbearable automaticity of being (1999) American Psychologist, 54 (7), pp. 462-479; Bargh, J.A., Gollwitzer, P.M., Lee-Chai, A., Barndollar, K., Trötschel, R., The automated will: Nonconscious activation and pursuit of behavioral goals (2001) Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 81 (6), pp. 1014-1027; Bayer, J.B., Campbell, S.W., Texting while driving on automatic: Considering the frequency-independent side of habit (2012) Computers in Human Behavior, 28 (6), pp. 2083-2090; Bayer, J.B., Panek, E.T., Dal Cin, S., Campbell, S.W., Consciousness and self-regulation in mobile communication Human Communication Research, , in press; Billieux, J., Problematic use of the mobile phone: A literature review and a pathways model (2012) Current Psychiatry Reviews, 8 (4), pp. 299-307; Billieux, J., van der Linden, M., Rochat, L., The role of impulsivity in actual and problematic use of the mobile phone (2008) Applied Cognitive Psychology, 22 (9), pp. 1195-1210; Boase, J., Ling, R., Measuring mobile phone use: Self-report versus log data (2013) Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication, 18 (4), pp. 508-519; Campbell, S.W., Ling, R., Bayer, J.B., The structural transformation of mobile communication: Implications for self and society (2014) Media and social life, pp. 176-188. , Oliver, Raney, (eds), New York, NY, Routledge,.

In this article, we argue that more qualitatively oriented designs can also benefit greatly from integrating these rich data sources into studies of smartphones in everyday life. Through an illustrative study, we explore a more nuanced perspective on what can be considered “log data” and how these types of data can be collected and analysed. A qualitative approach to log data analysis offers researchers new opportunities to situate smartphone use within people’s practices, norms, and routines. This is of relevance both to studies focusing on smartphones as cultural objects in everyday life and studies that use such devices as proxies for social behaviour more generally. We argue that log data, for instance in in-depth interviews, may serve as cues to instigate discussion and reflection as well as act as resources for contextualizing and organizing related empirical material. In the discussion, the advantages of a qualitative perspective for research designs are assessed in relation to issues of validity. Further perspectives on the promises of log data from various devices are proposed. © 2015, © The Author(s) 2015.","Interview; log data; qualitative research; smartphones; validity",,,,,,"Natur og Univers, Det Frie ForskningsrÃ¥d, FNU, DFF","This research was conducted in relation to the the project “Meaning Across Media - Cross-Media Communication and Co-Creation” (2012-2015) funded by The Danish Council for Independent Research and Humanities (FKK).",,"Allen, L., Picture this”: Using photo-methods in research on sexualities and schooling (2011) Qualitative Research, 11 (5), pp. 487-504; Berry, D., The computational turn: Thinking about the digital humanities (2011) Culture Machine, 12. , http://www.culturemachine.net/index.php/cm/article/viewArticle/440, Retrieved from:; Boase, J., Implications of software-based mobile media for social research (2013) Mobile Media & Communication, 1 (1), pp. 57-62; Boase, J., Ling, R., Measuring mobile phone use: Self-report versus log data (2013) Journal of Computer Mediated Communication, 18 (4), pp. 508-519; Caracelli, V.J., Greene, J.C., Data analysis strategies for mixed-method evaluation designs (1993) Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis, 15 (2), pp. 195-207; Chittaranjan, G., Blom, J., Gatica-Perez, D., Mining large-scale smartphone data for personality studies (2013) Personal and Ubiquitous Computing, 17 (3), pp. 433-450; Chuvakin, A., Schmidt, K., Phillips, C., (2013) Logging and log management: The authoritative guide to understanding the concepts surrounding logging and log management, , Waltham, MA, Syngress; Cranshaw, J., Toch, E., Hong, J., Kittur, A., Sadeh, N., (2010) Bridging the gap between physical location and online social networks, pp. 119-128. , Proceedings of the 12th ACM International Conference on Ubiquitous Computing, New York, NY, ACM,.

While previous studies have already addressed the impact of personality traits and cell phone usage patterns on the likelihood of experiencing phantom phone sensations, we were interested in additionally addressing the impact of situational context factors. An online questionnaire assessed especially cell phone usage patterns (e.g., frequency of cell phone usage), personality traits (e.g., Big Five, need for popularity), and contextual factors (e.g., awaiting a call, being in a noisy environment). Analyses (N = 249; 137 female) revealed that the majority of participants (83.5%) have experienced phantom phone sensations. Multivariate analysis methods indicated that, in particular, contextual factors regarding the social situation (awaiting a call) along with cell phone usage patterns are predictive for the experience of phantom phone sensations. Moreover, age was also found to have a high predictive value. © The Author(s) 2015.","Big Five personality traits; cell phone attachment; cell phone usage; excessive cell phone usage; mobile communication; need for popularity; phantom phone sensations; smartphone usage",,,,,,,,,"Agre, P.E., Welcome to the always-on world (2001) IEEE Spectrum, 38, pp. 10-13; Al-Ani, G.T.S., Mohammed, N.H., Hassan, A.E., Evaluation of the sensation of hearing false mobile sounds (phantom ring tone; ringxiety) in individuals (2009) The Iraqi Postgraduate Medical Journal, 8 (1), pp. 90-94; Cell phone users experience phantom ringing; suffer from ringxiety (2007) ScienceDaily, , www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/09/070914165302.htm, September, 17,.

In this paper, we examine one such MVAS, the Nokia Usaha Wanita service running on the Nokia Life+ platform in Indonesia, and we assess its impact as an innovative means for the economic empowerment of businesswomen. Data were gathered through 282 telephone interviews with a nationwide random sample of women who subscribed to Usaha Wanita. Our research found evidence that subscribers derived economic benefit from using the service. Subscribers reported that their business profits were greater, because of what they had learned from reading Usaha Wanita content. Women who were subscribers also had higher “good month’s” profits as well. Increased profits were positively correlated with frequent reading of the tips and information provided by Usaha Wanita and subscriber perception that the service was useful for business. Women who exhibited entrepreneurial optimism also had greater business profits. Findings suggest that entrepreneurial optimism amplified the effect of mobile phone use on profits. © 2015, © The Author(s) 2015.","Economic empowerment; Indonesia; microenterprises; mobile phones; mobile value-added services; women",,,,,,"ExxonMobil Foundation","This research was funded by the Cherie Blair Foundation for Women and the ExxonMobil Foundation.",,"Acharya, V., Rajan, A., Schoar, A., (2007) What determines entrepreneurial success?

In recent years, mobile news consumption has permeated individuals’ news consumption repertoires. The main purpose of this study is twofold: (a) gain insight in how mobile news outlets infiltrated the broader news media repertoires of mobile device owners and (b) understand in what circumstances mobile news is consumed within these news media repertoires. The key is to understand how and why this widening agency in appropriating various places and social spaces in everyday life relates to general news media consumption (Peters, 2012). This two-phased study aims to illuminate how mobile device owners position their mobile news consumption in relation to other types of news media outlets. First, a guiding cluster analysis of a large-scale questionnaire (N = 1279) was performed, indicating three types of news consumers. Second, in order to thicken the originally derived clusters, a mixed-method study was set up, combining objective data originating from mobile device logs with more subjective audience constructions through personal diaries and face-to-face interviews (N = 30). This study reveals the Janus-faced nature of mobile news. On the one hand, the majority of news consumers dominantly relies on traditional media outlets to stay informed, only to supplement with online mobile services in specific circumstances. Even then, there is at least a tendency to stick to trusted brand materials. On the other hand, these mobile news outlets/products do seem to increasingly infiltrate the daily lives of mobile audiences who were previously disengaged with news. © 2015, © The Author(s) 2015.","Mixed method; mobile news consumption; news media repertoires; news mobility; on-device logging study; user-centric research",,,,,,,,,"Caronia, L., Mobile culture: Ethnography of cellular phone uses in teenagers’ everyday life (2005) Convergence, 11 (3), pp. 96-103; Chan-Olmsted, S., Rim, H., Zerba, A., Mobile news adoption among young adults: Examining the roles of perceptions, news consumption, and media usage (2013) Journalism and Mass Communication Quarterly, 90 (1), pp. 126-147; Chyi, H.I., Chadha, M., News on new devices: Is multi-platform news consumption a reality?

Nationally representative data from a random-sample survey of American adults (N = 2,250) in the 2010 general election were analyzed to better explain who mobile election news users are, how they compare to nonusers, and whether mobile news use was associated with voter turnout and mobile campaign donation. Findings underscore the significance of mobile media use and mobile news as phenomena of emerging importance in the election campaigns, and important differential patterns in the relationships of sociodemographics, mobile media, and electoral participation are discussed. By providing a nuanced accounting of the socioeconomic and demographic profile of mobile election news users and how those individuals differ from nonusers, this study enriches explanations of how societal privilege and the benefits of political engagement are related in complicated ways to individual-level variations in consuming and using mobile election news. Notably, for racial minorities, mobile media may provide a bridge across the digital-driven democratic divide and a more effective means of engaging with digital election information than other ICTs. Analysis also extends what is known about how citizens use mobile news to engage with increasingly personalized election campaigns. Results indicate that mobile election news use was a significant positive predictor of the odds of having voted and whether individuals used their mobile devices to make contributions during the campaign. These findings support arguments that the unique qualities of mobile devices are contributing to new and different pathways to political engagement while also retaining significance in relation to traditional forms of offline political participation. © 2015, © The Author(s) 2015.","Democratic divide; electoral participation; mobile media; mobile news; mobile phones; political participation",,,,,,,,,"Barrett, M., Brunton-Smith, I., Political and civic engagement and participation: Towards an integrative perspective (2014) Journal of Civil Society, 10 (1), pp. 5-28; Best, S.J., Krueger, B.S., Analyzing representativeness of Internet political participation (2005) Political Behavior, 27 (2), pp. 183-216; Bimber, B., Digital media in the Obama campaigns of 2008 and 2012: Adaptation to the personalized political communication environment (2014) Journal of Information Technology & Politics, 11 (2), pp. 130-150; Campbell, S.W., Kwak, N., Mobile communication and civic life: Linking patterns of use to civic and political engagements (2010) Journal of Communication, 60, pp. 536-555; Campbell, S.W., Kwak, N., Political involvement in “mobilized” society: The interactive relationships among mobile communication, network characteristics, and political participation (2011) Journal of Communication, 61, pp. 1005-1024; Chan, M., Examining the influences of news use patterns, motivations, and age cohort on mobile news use: The case of Hong Kong (2015) Mobile Media & Communication, 3 (2), pp. 179-195; Chan-Olmstead, S., Rim, H., Zerba, A., Mobile news adoption among young adults: Examining the roles of perceptions, news consumption, and media usage (2012) Journalism & Mass Communication Quarterly, 90 (1), pp. 126-147; Chen, W., Givens, T., Mobile donation in America (2013) Mobile Media & Communication, 1 (2), pp. 196-212; Dale, A., Strauss, A., Don’t forget to vote: Text message reminders as a mobilization tool (2009) American Journal of Political Science, 53 (4), pp. 787-804; Duggan, M., Smith, A., (2013) Cell Internet use 2013, , http://www.pewinternet.org/2013/09/16/cell-internet-use-2013/, Pew Research Internet Project.

However, elders and their interests with regard to ICTs have been largely ignored due to a presupposed missing ability to use, a general disinterest in, and a lack of will to learn about ICT developments. This article wants to contribute to the debate about elders and their abilities to use and interests in ICTs. We analysed how elders in focus groups in Spain use mobile ICT applications, how they experiment with them and why they decide to use or not to use them. In our research, we have used apps as an example for ICTs because apps are considered to be flagships for technological innovation, and because, in contrast to call and messenger functions of mobile phones, the motivation for using apps has to come from the individual that uses them. Findings from 4 focus group discussions with elders from Spain suggest that age does not directly influence the perception of, experience with, and evaluation of newest technological developments.

Secondary analysis of a 2012 U.S. national phone survey is employed. Older respondents use mobile devices less for all functions, including following news, tend to be loyal print subscribers, and highly agree that it is important for news to be produced by professional news sources. However, when the effect of age is controlled, higher levels of education, and to a lesser extent, income, still significantly predict agreement about the importance of professional news sources. The results demonstrate the crucial impact of news attitudes, and are largely supportive of the mobile contingency model. The most important practical implication is that newspaper companies should be targeting their mobile applications not to their subscribers, but rather to nonsubscribers who have adopted mobile devices, are highly educated, and have higher incomes. © 2015, © The Author(s) 2015.","Attitudes toward news; functionality of mobile media; mobile media; mobile news; news contingency model",,,,,,,,,"Atkin, D., LaRose, R., A meta-analysis of the information services adoption literature: Lessons to be learned from cable and telephony (1994) Advances in telematics, 2, pp. 91-110. , Hanson, (ed), Norwood, NJ, Ablex,.

From the viewpoint of media organizations, UDC is a process by which the mass media converge with online social networks through the intentional use of social media and other platforms and services in an effort to expand the distribution of media content. In order to focus specifically on mobile news consumption, this paper sheds light on the novel phenomenon of mobile user-distributed content (mobile UDC). Mobile UDC is manifested in mobile users’ ability to share online media content on a perpetual and ubiquitous basis. The study utilizes the results from a survey carried out with Finnish Internet users. The main finding is that mobile Internet users are more active in UDC than those who do not use the Internet with mobile devices. It is thus argued that mobile UDC, as a developing concept, can be used to explain the practices that are characteristic of mobile online news consumption. © 2015, © The Author(s) 2015.","Mobile devices; mobile Internet; mobile news consumption; mobile user-distributed content; user-distributed content",,,,,,"Helsingin Sanomain SÃ¤Ã¤tiÃ¶","We would like to thank the Helsingin Sanomat Foundation for supporting our study as part of the Mobile Social Media and Media Organizations project.

Given the ubiquity of smartphones as mobile communication and computing devices along with the vast smartphone app market, our exploratory study aimed to understand how heuristics guide smartphone app selection. Observing 49 smartphone users from the US and Germany viewing 189 total apps from three predetermined categories, the current study identified five decision-making heuristics used to download a variety of smartphone apps. Of these, four were variants of a “Take the First” (TtF) heuristic that allowed smartphone users to quickly navigate the app market, by passing a good deal of other informational cues in order to download apps that were simply highly rated or ranked. Reliance on heuristic processing is useful in helping navigate the app market, but it also results in smartphone users overlooking potentially important app information. © 2015, © The Author(s) 2015.","Apps; decision-making; heuristics; mobile communication; smartphones",,,,,,,,,"(2013) Android will account for 58% of smartphone app downloads in 2013, with iOS commanding a market share of 75% in tablet apps, , https://www.abiresearch.com/press/android-will-account-for-58-of-smartphone-app-down, Retrieved from; Bellman, S., Johnson, E.J., Kobrin, S.J., Lohse, G.L., International differences in information privacy concerns: A global survey of consumers (2004) The Information Society: An International Journal, 20 (5), pp. 313-324. , http://ssrn.com/abstract=1324721, Retrieved from; Bellur, S., Sundar, S.S., How can we tell when a heuristic has been used?

This involves not only an extension of interaction across spaces of activity but also the remapping of how interpersonal communication practices are woven into the temporality and embodied practices of everyday life. The conditions for networked communication partially emerge through a consistent set of embodied background communication practices. These include practices of the individual maintaining contact with technological objects in their environment and also the habitual rhythms of interface-level practices, which together contribute to the forms of networked connection. Stemming from qualitative fieldwork with 35 participants during 2010 and 2011, this paper explores the organization and experience of networked interpersonal communication practices within the temporalities of everyday life. The individual’s perceived need for networked connection is proposed as the prerequisite for, but also a condition of, participation in contemporary everyday life. This paper explores the emerging role of networked time: where the constant and multiple embodied rhythms of individual engagement with overlapping media technologies, as objects and interfaces within the material environment, are interwoven with the capacity of those media to partially constitute one’s relationship to, and management of, time in everyday life. The tension between the finite minutes of the individual’s day and the limitless potential of networked connection is explored through the individual’s interface-level practices to avoid being temporally overwhelmed by potential interactions. In this manner, communication is perceived and managed as distinct, quantifiable, but variable units of time in and of themselves: interaction as “tasks” to be addressed and completed through engagement. © 2015, © The Author(s) 2015.","Connection; mobile communication; network; online communication; social; time; work",,,,,,,,,"Boczkowski, P.J., (2010) News at work: Imitation in an age of information abundance, , Chicago, IL, University of Chicago Press; Boczkowski, P.J., The consumption of online news at work (2010) Information, Communication, and Society, 13 (4), pp. 470-484; Boden, D., Molotch, H., The compulsion to proximity (1994) Nowhere.

These expectations are meaningful within a cultural context where economic resources are expected to flow from migrants to nonmigrants. As this case demonstrates, the general belief in nonmigrants’ entitlement to the achievements of those who migrate regardless of their status abroad, also means migrant students are involved in remittances practices. The students are expected to remit and at the same time, they are conscious of their obligation to support people who stay back in the home country. As such, the mobile phone ideally provides an infrastructure through which monetary resources could be coordinated and channeled to Cameroon.

The present investigation examines why sports spectators use social media (e.g., Facebook and Twitter) while attending sporting events. Based on a cross-sectional survey of 466 participants who generally attended games with friends or family, structural equation modeling analysis revealed that social media use through a mobile device during sporting event attendance served four functions: information-based and game pleasure-based utilitarian functions, an ego-defensive function, and a value-expressive function. The first three functions, descriptive norms, and self-efficacy predicted attitudes toward social media use. When placed within a larger theoretical framework, attitudes, self-efficacy, descriptive norms, and the ego-defensive function predicted intentions to use social media during sporting event attendance. Both theoretical and practical implications are discussed. © 2015, © The Author(s) 2015.","Attitude functions; mobile media; social media use; sporting event; theory of planned behavior",,,,,,,,,"Ajzen, I., The theory of planned behavior (1991) Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes, 50, pp. 179-211; Ajzen, I., (2002) Constructing a theory of planned behavior questionnaire, , http://people.umass.edu/aizen/pdf/tpb.measurement.pdf, Retrieved from; Armitage, C.J., Conner, M., Social cognition models and health behaviour: A structured review (2000) Psychology and Health, 15, pp. 173-189; Armitage, C., Conner, M., Efficacy of the theory of planned behaviour: A meta-analytic review (2001) British Journal of Social Psychology, 40, pp. 471-499; Bandura, A., Cultivate self-efficacy for personal and organizational effectiveness (2009) Handbook of principles of organizational behavior: Indispensable knowledge for evidence-based management, pp. 179-200. , Locke, (ed), 2nd ed., West Sussex, UK, Wiley,.

This study identifies multilevel psychosocial factors predicting individual intention to use mobile audiovisual services. The national telephone survey obtained a random sample of 503 respondents. The findings show variables of the theory of planned behavior (TPB; i.e., attitude, subjective norm, and perceived behavioral control) and social norms are key predictors for mobile video consumption. In the research model, impression management is significantly associated with attitude, subjective norm, and individual social norms while perceived government and operator facilitation are associated with collective social norms.

Amid these developments, many people have shifted the ways they access the news in everyday life, with mobile devices gaining much significance. This has shifted the roles traditionally played by newspapers, television stations, radio broadcasters and news sites, ultimately relating to their democratic functions and the diminishing effect of their business models. This article will describe and explain displacing vis-à-vis complementary effects among age cohorts. It shows how the recent uptake of mobile devices has influenced news consumption via newspapers and news sites. It investigates three research questions, each focusing age cohorts in relation to single-media use, cross-media use, and nonuse. The article presents a statistical analysis of datasets nationally representative to Sweden and the specific case of evening tabloids. The data used originate from scientific omnibus survey projects conducted annually from 1986 to 2012 at the University of Gothenburg. The findings show that the public generally engage in single-media rather than cross-media news consumption, whereas age cohorts have developed divergent forms of single-media use: (a) the 1930s and 1940s age cohort are primarily single-media users in print, (b) the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s age cohorts are computer-oriented single-media users; and (c) the 1980s and 1990s age cohorts are mainly single-media users via mobile devices, but also cross-media users of mobile devices combined with a computer. As of 2012, the uptake of mobile news and cross-media news consumption reached new records, whereas the single-media use of printed newspapers reached a new low. The integrated theoretical framework proves useful for comprehending such transforming news consumption among age cohorts, and reveals the significance for legacy news media to explore and exploit the opportunities arising from mobile devices and tablets. © 2015, ©The Author(s) 2015.","Age cohorts; complementary effects; cross-media news; digital journalism; displacing effects; mobile news; news consumption; newspaper reading; online news; tablet news",,,,,,,,,"Bailard, C.S., Mobile phone diffusion and corruption in Africa (2009) Political Communication, 26, pp. 333-353; Belson, W., The effects of television on the reading and buying of newspapers and magazines (1961) Public Opinion Quarterly, 25, pp. 366-381; Bergström, A., Wadbring, I., The contribution of free dailies and news on the Web: Implications of media structural changes for the Swedish newspaper readership market (2010) Northern Lights, 8, pp. 139-155; Bolin, G., Media generations: Objective and subjective media landscapes and nostalgia among generations of media users Participations: Journal of Audience and Reception Studies, 11. , in press; Bolin, G., Skogerbø, E., Age, generation and the media (2013) Northern Lights, 11 (1), pp. 147-173; Carlsson, U., Facht, U., (2014) MedieSverige 2013 (MediaSweden 2013), , Gothenburg, Sweden, Nordicom, University of Gothenburg, (Eds.).

However, our field has not devoted as much attention to another mobile technology used to track far more people and things than smartphones: radio frequency identification (RFID) tags. RFID tags are used to track products and people, and they are an increasingly important part of the infrastructure of the Internet of Things. This article argues that mobile media scholars have much to contribute to scholarly analyses of RFID. I make that argument by first giving background on RFID as a mobile technology. I then identify and discuss four areas of research related to RFID tags—Big Data, surveillance, space and place, and nonhuman agency—that are particularly relevant to mobile media scholars. © 2015, ©The Author(s) 2015.","Agency; Big Data; locative media; RFID; space and place; surveillance",,,,,,,,,"Albrecht, K., McIntyre, L., (2006) Spychips, , New York, NY, Plume; Allen-Robertson, J., Beer, D., Mobile ideas: Tracking a concept through time and space (2010) Mobilities, 5 (4), pp. 529-545; Ayoade, J., RFID adoption in the developed and developing world (2011) Journal of Current Issues in Media & Telecommunications, 3 (1), pp. 73-83; Aztori, L., Iera, A., Morabito, G., The Internet of things: A survey (2010) Computer Networks, 54 (15), pp. 2787-2805; Bhuptani, M., Moradpour, S., (2006) RFID field guide: Deploying radio frequency identification systems, , New York, NY, Prentice Hall; Bleeker, J., (2006) A manifesto for networked objects – Cohabiting with pigeons, arphids and aibos in the Internet of Things, , http://nearfuturelaboratory.com/files/WhyThingsMatter.pdf, Retrieved from; Bogost, I., (2012) Alien phenomenology, or what it’s like to be a thing, , Minneapolis, University of Minnesota Press; boyd, D., Crawford, K., Critical questions for Big Data (2012) Information, Communication & Society, 15 (5), pp. 662-679; Bull, M., (2000) Sounding out the city: Personal stereos and the management of everyday life, , Oxford, UK, Berg; Chan, H.K., Could RFID-based systems be regarded as multi-agent systems?

And yet, communities persist in the face of this constant motion. This is a qualitative study of a mobile labor group—taxi drivers in Chicago. Similar to Wallis’s (2011) conclusions, I found that access to and use of a mobile phone does not automatically imbue taxi drivers with power and autonomy from forces that seem to be working against them. However, access to mobile phones does help to shake up the hierarchy of control in the taxi industry. This study has also identified another type of community where the theory of polymedia (Madianou & Miller, 2012) applies, that is, labor communities, and has shown that while choice of technology may offer some sense of power, access to mobile communication technology does not necessarily result in significant changes in power structures within and surrounding a community. © 2015, © The Author(s) 2015.","Community; interviews; mobile communication; mobility; observation; power",,,,,,,,,"Bruno, R., Hewitt, R., (2010) Driven into poverty: A comprehensive study of the Chicago taxicab industry Report III: Taxi lease, , Chicago, University of Illinois School of Labor and Employment Relations; Bruno, R., Hewitt, R., (2010) Driven into poverty: A comprehensive study of the Chicago taxicab industry Report IV: Law enforcement, , Chicago, University of Illinois School of Labor and Employment Relations; Bruno, R., Schneidman, J., (2009) Driven into poverty: A comprehensive study of the Chicago taxicab industry Report I: Income, , Chicago, University of Illinois School of Labor and Employment Relations; Büscher, M., Urry, J., Witchger, K., (2011) Mobile methods, , London, UK, Routledge; Castells, M., (2000) The rise of the network society, , 2nd ed., Malden, MA, Blackwell; Castells, M., (2009) Communication power, , Oxford, UK, Oxford University Press; Chib, A., Malik, S., Aricat, R.G., Kadir, S.Z., Migrant mothering and mobile phones: Negotiations of transnational identity (2014) Mobile Media & Communication, 2, pp. 73-93; (2008) Public chauffeurs rules and regulations, , http://www.cityofchicago.org/content/dam/city/depts/bacp/rulesandregs/publicchauffeursrulesregs20121203.pdf, May, 1, City of Chicago, Department of Consumer Services Public Vehicle Operations Division,.

The use of mobile phones as instruments for participatory communication in public service broadcasting (PSB) has been growing and gaining strength in the so-called Third World. In this article it is argued that members of audience from different parts of Tanzania use mobile phones to participate in dialogue taking place on national radio (TBC-TAIFA) and/or national television (TBC1), and share their knowledge and lived experiences with the national audience as if they lived next door to each other. Further, the findings of this study show that TBC journalists use mobile phones to interact and involve the audiences in the processes of producing programmes. Consequently, TBC communication has become less hierarchical, more two-way, horizontal, and interactive. Moreover, the study reveals that the audiences use phone-in programmes on TBC as a platform to air the voices and concerns of the grass-roots population. Thus, the use of mobile phones as tools for participatory communication via TBC sets an agenda, which helps to bring about some social changes and transformation. © 2014, © The Author(s) 2014.","ICTs; mass communication; mobile phones; participatory communication; public service broadcasting",,,,,,,,,"Braman, S., Technology (2004) The Sage handbook in media studies, pp. 123-144. , Downing, McQuail, Schlesinger, Wartella, (eds), London, UK, Sage,.

Considering technical advancements such as mobile Internet, smartphones, and tablet-PCs, m-government represents a tremendous new potential for the communication between governments and citizens. There are many examples of failures of early e-government projects due to a lack of consideration of users’ requirements. Against this background, this article tries to contribute to governmental communication processes by addressing the driving factors influencing the acceptance of mobile government among e-government users. Extending the approaches of the technology acceptance model (TAM; Davis, Bagozzi, & Warshaw, 1989) and the theory of planned behavior (TPB; Ajzen, 1991) to mobile government, a new m-government acceptance model was developed. It shows that the intention to use m-government is significantly influenced by both, factors users see as a benefit but also by factors of perceived risks. © 2014, © The Author(s) 2014.","E-government; mobile government; perceived risk; TAM; TPB",,,,,,,,,"Ajzen, I., The theory of planned behavior (1991) Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes, 50 (2), pp. 179-211; Al-Khamayseh, S., Lawrence, E., Zmijewska, A., (2006) Towards understanding success factors in interactive mobile government, pp. 3-5. , Proceedings of the Second European Conference on Mobile Government (Euro mGov) – Oortunities for eGovernment: Adapting to Mobile and Ubiquitous Business, Brighton, UK: Mobile Government Consortium International, (; Al Thunibat, A., Mat Zin, N.A., Sahari, N., Identifying user requirements of mobile government services in Malaysia using focus group method (2011) Journal of E-Government Studies and Best Practices, 25 (2), pp. 103-110; (2013) Jeder Dritte hat ein Smartphone, , http://www.bitkom.org/de/presse/74532_71854.aspx, ].

Interviews with low-income, urban U.S. residents reveal that cell phones are an asset for psychological reassurance, crime prevention, and critical access to emergency help. At the same time findings reveal that these residents often have broken and disconnected cell phones that require constant upkeep, or technology maintenance. Reliance on second-hand, government, and no-contract phones ease cell phone ownership but also normalize intermittent disconnection leading to dependably instability. These findings demonstrate the extreme value of cell phone access for residents of poor neighborhoods, and at the same time indicate that disparities in cell phone access still persist and may be worsening. © 2014, © The Author(s) 2014.","Cell phone; crime prevention; digital divide; health; poverty; reassurance; safety; technology maintenance",,,,,,"Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, RWJF","This project was funded through a grant from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.",,"Aoki, K., Downes, E.J., An analysis of young people’s use of and attitudes toward cell phones (2003) Telematics and Informatics, 20, pp. 349-364; Batista, E., SMS provides SOS lifeline (2001) Wired, , http://www.wired.com/science/discoveries/news/2001/02/41621, Retrieved from; Berkman, L.F., Kawachi, I., (2000) Social epidemiology, , New York, NY, Oxford University Press; Blau, J.R., Blau, P.M., The cost of inequality: Metropolitan structure and violent crime (1982) American Sociological Review, 47, pp. 114-129; Blumberg, S.J., Luke, J.V., (2012) Wireless substitution: Early release of estimates from the National Health Interview Survey, January–June 2012, , http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhis/earlyrelease/wireless201212.pdf, Division of Health Interview Statistics, National Center for Health Statistics,.

To answer these questions, an exploratory quasi-experiment has been conducted, consisting of three groups of participants, each group differing in their method for obtaining location information as well as the frequency with which this information is consumed. Semistructured pre- and postexperiment interviews with participants, questionnaires that were filled out by the participants after every app usage, and expert interviews with navigational AR app developers are employed in combination with analyzing the effect of augmented reality on the user’s perception of space. Surprisingly, it was found that AR users actually became less aware of their surroundings than non-AR navigational app users. This is mainly due to the comparatively worse performance of AR apps on currently available smartphones: The overall quality regularly suffers from a cluttered and confusing presentation, leading to considerable amounts of time spent “deciphering” the layout and functionality of the presented results. Erratic result behavior, caused by frequent movement delays and unexpected lag of the virtual objects further decreases the quality of the overall experience. Finally, some initially unexpected issues related to the social acceptability of augmented reality app usage in public places were encountered during the experiment, which are explained by the physically very involved method of interacting with AR apps, namely having to point and hold the device into the direction information is being sought over. Nevertheless, augmented reality was found to have a number of distinct advantages over other navigational apps, namely the ability to improve the users’ understanding of proximity, directions, and spatial relations. © 2014, © The Author(s) 2014.","Augmented reality; hybrid space; mobile devices; navigational app; time–space compression",,,,,,,,,"Azuma, R., Baillot, Y., Behringer, R., Feiner, S., Julier, S., MacIntyre, B., Recent advances in augmented reality (2001) Computer Graphics and Applications, IEEE, 21 (6), pp. 34-47; Babbie, E., (2008) The basics of social research, , Belmont, CA, Thomson Wadsworth; Bergig, O., Hagbi, N., El-Sana, J., Kedem, K., Billinghurst, M., In-place augmented reality (2010) Virtual Reality, 15 (2-3), pp. 201-212; Chandra, S., Top 20 augmented reality apps [Web log message] (2013) DeepKnowHow, , http://deepknowhow.com/2013/04/04/top-20-augmented-reality-apps-for-android-and-iphoneipad-users/, April, 4,.

The author draws attention to what he calls the “doubly digital” quality of contemporary media—pointing to the intimate connection between movements through media settings (such as online environments) and movements of the fingers or digits on keyboards, keypads, touch-screens, and so on. His main interest is in mobile, generative ways of the hand that is at home with communication technologies, and in opening up an investigation of media uses as manual activities. In exploring these mobile, generative ways, he also reflects on a range of other manual activities that are apparently unrelated to media use—venturing into the disciplines of philosophy, sociology, and anthropology to discuss phenomenological perspectives on practices of typing, organ and piano playing, and plank sawing. Out of his exploration emerges a focus on embodied, sensuous, practical knowing, and on matters of orientation and habitation (with the author advocating a distinctive nonrepresentational, non-media-centric approach for future studies of media use in everyday life). © 2014, © The Author(s) 2014.","digital; environment; habitation; hands; media; movement; orientation; practice",,,,,,,,,"Bourdieu, P., (1977) Outline of a theory of practice, , Cambridge, UK, Cambridge University Press; Bourdieu, P., (1990) The logic of practice, , Cambridge, UK, Polity; Cranny-Francis, A., (2013) Technology and touch: The biopolitics of emerging technologies, , Basingstoke, UK, Palgrave Macmillan; de Certeau, M., (1984) The practice of everyday life, , Berkeley, University of California Press; Dreyfus, H., Foreword (2001) Ways of the hand: A rewritten account, pp. 9-13. , Sudnow, (ed), Cambridge, MA, MIT Press,.

Thus further analysis was done in order to present a new typology and framing of religious apps, which more accurately describe their design. We suggest that the 11 new categories offered here suggest a critical framework for studying religious apps. Thus this study provides a starting point for scholars interested in analyzing religious mobile applications to investigate how app developers integrate religious goals into their designs, and consider the primary ways people are expected to practice religion through mobile apps. © 2014, © The Author(s) 2014.","Apps; categorization; iTunes; mobile applications; religion",,,,,,"Texas A and M University, TAMU","This research received funding support from the Initiative for Digital Humanities, Media and Culture at Texas A&M University.",,"Abroms, L., Padmanabhan, N., Thaweethai, L., iPhone apps for smoking cessation (2011) American Journal of Preventive Medicine, 40 (3), pp. 279-285; Bell, G., No more SMS from Jesus: Ubicomp, religion, and techno-spiritual practices (2006) Ubicomp 2006, LNCS 4206, pp. 141-158. , Dourish, Friday, (eds), Berlin, Germany, Springer-Verlag,.

However, the emergent field of mobile-focused political participation research requires further definition and development to more clearly address why and how mobile media are producing distinct consequences for political participation. To address this problem, this article uses interdisciplinary insights and a critical review of relevant literature to identify research opportunities that stand to advance mobile political communication theory. Contributions and limitations of studies focused on ICTs and political participation are reviewed and discussed. Analysis of studies focused on the political participation outcomes of mobile media use is synthesized with theory from user-focused mobile communication literature to highlight the unique qualities that distinguish mobile media and the implications of those distinguishing features for studying political participation. Recommendations are made for research directions that would further investigate the association of mobile media’s distinctive features with online and offline forms of political participation. This analysis indicates opportunities for scholars to unpack mobile media’s unique features in ways that potentially redefine political participation, and, accordingly, further the development of research questions and theories that investigate the relationship of mobile media and political participation. It is concluded that research is needed that explains mobile media use in finer detail, accounts for shifting conceptualizations of political participation, and contributes to the development of cross-cultural comparative frameworks. © 2014, © The Author(s) 2014.","Media effects; mobile communication; mobile devices; mobile media; mobile phones; political communication; political participation; politics",,,,,,"DePaul University

While such observations are compelling, they lack a conceptual context. This paper theorizes the smartphone in the general terms of mediatization. Emphasis is on existing and emerging technologies of the mediatization process and the consequent “intercorporeal” relationships users construct with the smartphone. Empirical findings about the often intensely personal usage of the smartphone document this phenomenology. The paper concludes by introducing three provocative implications of new media like the smartphone, which are both indicators and motors of mediatization, as focuses for future study: technogenesis, or the coevolution of people and their information machines; embodied and extended cognition, the intensifying interweaving of mind and thinking machines; and the subjectifying process of individualization, ever more dependent on digital self-creation and self-maintenance. © 2014, © The Author(s) 2014.","Mediatization; new media technologies; personal and ecological interfaces; Smartphone",,,,,,,,,"Barnes, B., A tablet for children that comes with its own penguins (2014) The New York Times, , http://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/03/business/media/a-tablet-for-children-that-comes-with-its-own-penguins.html, January, 2,.

The argument is based on two case studies: (a) the civic outrage of young people concerning the destruction of a youth centre in Copenhagen, Denmark in 2006 and (b) the use of mobile phones in antifascist protests in Dresden, Germany in 2011. The cases are analysed across three dimensions that are relevant to mobile communication tactics for providing information in protest: Actors, power relations between the actors, and goals. By identifying the affordances of the mobile phone for providing information across these dimensions, we argue that mobile communication can be appropriated to increase activists’ repertoire of actions, foster resistance, and shut down opportunities. The ways in which the affordances of mobile phones limit and empower resistance are located at the intersection of coordination, mobilisation, and the creation of counter narratives as well as of the surveillance and maintenance of existing power relations. © 2014, © The Author(s) 2014.","Collective action; information; mobile communication; protest; surveillance",,,,,,,,,"Albrechtslund, A., Online social networking as participatory surveillance (2008) First Monday, 13 (3). , http://firstmonday.org/article/view/2142/1949, ).

This paper investigates the role of mobile phone usage, via voice, text messages, and social networking sites, in dealing with the tensions and ambivalence arising from transnational mothering as a dialectical process. We surveyed 42 Filipina and Indonesian foreign domestic workers (FDWs) in Singapore using a mixture of quantitative and qualitative methods. FDWs addressed tensions arising out of societal expectations of motherhood and their own anxieties about children’s well-being. The reluctant obsessive struggled to maintain a balance between an intensive nurturing style and a deviant mode of mothering that respected the growing independence of the children. The diverted professional had to balance the financial empowerment of being the primary breadwinner with the risk of surrogate motherhood for the employer’s children subsuming the care provided to her own. The remote-control parent shared mothering responsibilities with caregivers, usually relatives, who acted as a contradictory proxy presence for intensive mothering. The incomplete union of stressed marital parenting put further pressure on the romantic and sexual identities of migrant women. Transnational mothers utilized mobile phones actively as a tool to negotiate and redefine identities and relationships that created fissures in their sense of self. These included the management of third-party relationships, withholding of emotions or information, and engaging in counterintuitive phenomenon such as restricting, or actively dis-engaging from, mobile phone usage as a communication strategy. The paper calls for future research into the multiple, and interacting, social identities assumed and managed by transnational mothers, and the complex role played by mobile phones in the constant process of negotiation by agentic, self-relective and multifaceted women. © 2014, © The Author(s) 2014.","Dialectic; identity; migration; mobile phone; mothering; social network; transnational",,,,,,"Nanyang Technological University, NTU","The study was supported by a grant from the Wee Kim Wee School of Communication and Information, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore.",,"Aguila, A.P.N., Living long-distance relationships through computer-mediated communication (2009) Social Science Diliman, 5 (1-2), pp. 83-106; Arendell, T., (1999) Mothering and motherhood: A decade review, , Berkeley, University of California, (Center for Working Families Working Paper No. 3); Arendell, T., Conceiving and investigating motherhood: The decade’s scholarship (2000) Journal of Marriage and Family, 62 (4), pp. 1192-1207; Ashforth, B.E., Kreiner, G.E., How can you do it?”: Dirty work and the challenge of constructing a positive identity (1999) The Academy of Management Review, 24 (3), pp. 413-434; Battistella, G., Conaco, M.C.G., The impact of labour migration on the children left behind: A study of elementary school children in the Philippines (1998) Sojourn, 13 (2), pp. 220-241; Baxter, L.A., Montgomery, B.M., (1996) Relating: Dialogues and dialectics, , New York, NY, Guilford; Baym, K., Zhang, Y., Kunkel, A., Ledbetter, A., Lin, M., Relational quality and media use in interpersonal relationships (2007) New Media & Society, 9 (5), pp. 735-752; Boyatzia, R.E., (1998) Transforming qualitative information: Thematic analysis and code, , London, UK, Sage; Brewer, M.B., The social self: On being the same and different at the same time (1991) Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, 17 (5), pp. 475-482; Chib, A., Aricat, R., Seeking the non-developmental within the developmental: Mobile phones in the globalized migration context (2012) Can emerging technologies make a difference in development?, pp. 153-167. , Parker, Aelbaum, (eds), New York, NY, Routledge,.

While there is little argument in their growth as primary communication tools, scholars have actively debated their role as conduits for dynamic and diverse, information flow. This study explores how an international cohort of university students uses mobile phones for daily communication and information needs. In spring 2012, 793 students from 8 universities on 3 continents participated in a 24-hour mobile tracking exercise and reflection to answer the questions: How are college students using mobile phones for daily communication and information needs? and, how do college students perceive of the role of mobile phones for communication and information needs in their daily lives? The findings point to a population tethered to their mobile devices primarily through social networking apps, to the extent that they find it increasingly difficult to distinguish relationships that exist in their pockets from those that exist in their physical surroundings. While the participants acknowledged the diverse and participatory capacity of mobile devices, their dependence on the phone for connecting to peers left them skeptical of the phone’s efficacy for productive connectivity, vibrant communication, and diverse information consumption in daily life. The study concludes with suggestions for more inclusive and active engagement in the dynamic potential of phones that are not necessitated by a response to large-scale political or civil injustices. © 2014, © The Author(s) 2014.","Civic engagement; global media; media literacy; mobile phones; participatory culture",,,,,,,,,"Allan, S., Civic voices: Social media and political protest (2012) News literacy: Global perspectives for the newsroom and the classroom, pp. 23-39. , Mihailidis, (ed), New York, NY, Peter Lang,.

Building on this line of research, this study explores the effect of smartphone use on civil discourse engagement in China, with its nearly 900 million mobile phone users. Results reveal the smartphone’s role as an outlet of public information, which fosters political talk with others, but also suggest use of government-controlled traditional media stifles open civic discourse. Hierarchical regression analyses show that talking politics in private, extensive use of the smartphone, and mobile tweeting were positive predictors of engagement in online civic discourse. © 2014, © The Author(s) 2014.","Discourse engagement; mobile communication; political communication; political talk; smartphones",,,,,,"University of South Carolina, USC","Thanks to the College of Mass Communications and Information Studies at the University of South Carolina for funding this study.",,"Bakker, T.P., De Vreese, C.H., Good news for the future?

Select theoretical propositions about the role of mobile communication in the “social emancipation” of youth were explicated and tested using a national survey of teens in the US. Drawing from this perspective, we hypothesized that sexting would be associated with levels of peer and family mobile connectivity, although in opposite ways, as well as parental control over the technology. As hypothesized, involvement in sexting was positively predicted by connectedness to peers through mobile communication and negatively predicted by connectedness to family. Although sexting was less likely with mobile connectedness to family, heavy-handed parental control over the technology was not a predictor. The discussion offers theoretical and practical implications of these and other findings, along with directions for future research. © 2014, © The Author(s) 2014.","Adolescence; adolescents; cell phone; mobile communication; mobile phone; sexting; social emancipation; teens; text messaging",,,,,,,,,"Arcabascio, C., Sexting and teenagers: OMG R U going 2 jail???

Through the use of apps in mobile devices, the consumption of risk is experiencing a shift from space-bound betting to itinerant practices that open new spaces for leisure and socialization. Focusing on a case study of the mobile app Zynga Poker, this paper attempts to identify and describe these “leakages” in the “magic circle” of gambling, which bring together social gaming and longstanding gambling cultures and practices. Our argument is that mobile gambling on smartphones and tablets extends earlier cultural practices associated with gambling activities such as poker, and much deeper into the realm of the everyday. The expansion of gambling practices into the realm of the everyday, however, poses manifold ethical, cultural, and political implications: the availability of gambling products to minors and other vulnerable populations; increased normalization of wagering as entertainment; and the merging of gambling and mobile gaming industries and markets. Digital gambling is a pressing area for future study in mobile media and communication. © 2014, © The Author(s) 2014.","mobile media; online gambling; social gaming; social networking",,,,,,,,,"Adam, B., Beck, U., van Loon, J., (2000) The risk society and beyond: Critical issues for social theory, , London, UK, Sage, (Eds.).

With location-based services (LBS) smartphone apps like Instagram geotagging is increasingly the default, rather than choice. This has transformed both how we experience and conceptualize co-present relationships across micro and macro realms and how we chart these relationships and environments as we move through the everyday world. Through a preliminary study of 10 users of smartphones in urban Australia we explore their daily routines and how camera phone and LBS practices become part of those everyday repetitions. In 2013, Australia mobile Internet subscriptions have now reached 22.1 million: basically one subscription for every person in the country. To understand these new everyday visualities we develop the notion of the “digital wayfarer” as a way to think about the perpetually moving mobile media user. Expanding upon Tim Ingold’s notion of the wayfaring type of mobility that is both routine and repetitive (i.e., “transport”) in the realm of the digital interwoven within the everyday, we reflect upon the digital wayfarer as they move through taking and sharing pictures and their tagged geographic and temporal contexts as part of broader emplaced and interwoven visualities and socialities. © 2014, © The Author(s) 2014.","Camera phones; location-based services (LBS); locative media; networked visuality; smartphones",,,,,,,,,"(2013) Report 3—Smartphones and tablets: Take-up and use in Australia, , http://www.acma.gov.au/webwr/_assets/main/lib310665/report-3-smartphones_tablets-summary.pdf, Retrieved from; Arminen, I., Social functions of location in mobile telephony (2006) Personal and Ubiquitous Computing, 10 (5), pp. 319-323; Beaulieu, A., From co-location to co-presence: Shifts in the use of ethnography for the study of knowledge (2010) Social Studies of Science, 40 (3), pp. 453-470; Bissell, D., Fuller, G., (2011) Stillness in a mobile world, , London, UK, Routledge, (Eds.)

When smartphones incorporate the Internet into their multimedia functions, they enable people to access various mobile social communication spaces in which existing forms of mobile communication, such as calls and text messages, coexist with forms of Internet communication such as instant messengers, emails, and social networking sites (SNSs) on the move. This study attempts to focus on the newly emerging mobile communication practices that have resulted from smartphones allowing people to access their SNSs anytime and anywhere. To understand how the mobility and immediate accessibility of smartphones have affected the communication practices of SNS, the study will pay particular attention to the use of Twitter via smartphones. This study will explore this through 49 Korean Twitter users’ everyday practices of communication and social interaction via their smartphones. Based on qualitative interview data, this study discusses how mobile social media forms a pseudo-aural space for volatile but self-expediential social networks and how it shapes a new sociality. It suggests that this sociality strays from existing social practices and has a new cultural significance. © 2013, © The Author(s) 2013.","Mobile social space; new sociality; pseudo-aural space; smartphones; Twitter",,,,,,"Incheon National University, INU","This work was supported by the Incheon National University Research Grant in 2010.",,"Baek, I., Sokboseongyi saeroun gwonryeok buyeo (Newsflashes provide a new power) (2010) The Kyunghyang Shinmun, , http://news.khan.co.kr/kh_news/khan_art_view.html?artid=201010051512065&code=210000, October, 5,.

Based on 31 individual semistructured interviews with Danish high school students and a grounded theory approach, it finds that instrumental use of information on smartphones has become an integrated and relied on part of everyday lives of these young Danes. Near-ubiquitous access to information is found to have consequences at both individual and social levels. Individually, users are able to look up information irrespective of the time and place and respond and adapt to this information in a rapid and flexible manner: a process the article refers to as “flexible alignment.” Further, near-ubiquitous access to information may lead to a more flexible orientation among users, who come to depend on just-in-time (rather than ahead-of-time) access to information in dealing with the contingencies of everyday life. Socially, the article finds that users may become increasingly autonomous vis-à-vis the network of social contacts, as mobile access to information is no longer exclusively available through mediated person-to-person communication but can be accessed individually as well. © 2013, © The Author(s) 2013.","Cell phones; information technology; mobile communication; mobile Internet; smartphones; youth",,,,,,,,,"Aakhus, M., Katz, J.E., (2002) Perpetual contact, , Cambridge, UK, Cambridge University Press; Aarup, L., Nielsen, E., Steenberg, M., Andersen, A.S., (2012) Rapport 217 – Børn og mobiltelefoner, , Copenhagen, FDB Analyse; (2012) Stor udvikling i antal smartphones og tablets, , http://danskemedier.dk/nyhed/stor-udvikling-i-antal-smartphones-og-tablets/, ].

Building on a corpus of 93 recorded mobile phone conversations from the United States and Denmark, this article adds to current interaction research by investigating how location is produced, understood and socially accomplished via mobile phones. More specifically, we investigate how location talk operates in the opening sequences of the call. We find that location is an opening-relevant topic: speakers introduce it as the reason for the call and topicalize it following initial engagement. When referring to location, speakers predominately use two variations: inquiries (where are you), and reports of their whereabouts (I just got home). Further, speakers formulate their locations in two ways: location specific (I’m sitting on a train) or status of transit (we are on our way). In addition to open format where-are-you elicitations, location talk can take the form of a candidate (are you at Union street); candidate formulations show how speakers orient to the collaborative work of meeting up with one another and display knowledge about each other’s activities. Finally, we treat the case of reciprocal location inquiries and reports, where both caller and callee state their whereabouts, showing how location talk is sequence organized. © 2013, © The Author(s) 2013.","Call opening; conversation analysis; location; mobile calls; mobile communication",,,,,,,,,"Arminen, I., (2003) Location: A socially dynamic property – A study of location telling in mobile phone calls, , Paper presented at the The Good, the Bad and the Irrelevant: The User and the Future of Information and Communication Technologies, Helsinki; Arminen, I., Sequential order and sequence structure: The case of incommensurable studies on mobile phone calls (2005) Discourse Studies, 7 (6), pp. 649-662; Arminen, I., Social functions of location in mobile telephony (2006) Personal and Ubiquitous Computing, 10 (5), pp. 319-323; Arminen, I., Leinonen, M., Mobile phone call openings: Tailoring answers to personalized summonses (2006) Discourse Studies, 8 (3), pp. 339-368; Arminen, I., Weilenmann, A., Mobile presence and intimacy: Reshaping social actions in mobile contextual configuration (2009) Journal of Pragmatics, 41 (10), pp. 1905-1923; Atkinson, J.M., Heritage, J., (1984) Structures of social action : studies in conversation analysis, , Cambridge, UK, Cambridge University Press; Coyne, R., (2010) The tuning of place : Sociable spaces and pervasive digital media, p. 330. , http://ez.statsbiblioteket.dk:2048/login?url=http://site.ebrary.com/lib/stats/Top?id=10386194, Retrieved from full text available from Ebrary Academic Complete International Subscription Collection:; Haddon, L., Green, N., (2009) Mobile communications: An introduction to new media, , English ed., Oxford, UK, Berg; Hopper, R., (1992) Telephone conversation, , Bloomington, Indiana University Press; Houtkoop-Steenstra, H., Opening sequences in Dutch telephone conversations (1991) Talk and social structure: Studies in ethnomethodology and conversation analysis, , Boden, Zimmerman, (eds), Oxford, UK, Polity,.

So is the case with mobile Internet (m-Internet) adoption and diffusion. This paper discusses this process from the stakeholders’ and users’ perspectives and confronts their understanding and attitudes towards this technology with three complementary theoretical models: network theory, activity theory, and the technology acceptance model (TAM).The study presents results for the use of m-Internet in a southern European country and frames those in light of the activities, here understood as effects of the network, undertaken by the users. We seek to assess whether individuals perform a different set of activities when using m-Internet and how different forms of access result in different network effects, adoption processes, and distinct forms of interaction. The depicted study involved a qualitative stage, consisting of a set of interviews to stakeholders of the mobile communications industry and a quantitative study that involved the survey of a nationally representative sample of individual users. The findings of these studies provide several contributions to the understanding of m-Internet adoption and diffusion and the role network effects play in them. © 2013, © The Author(s) 2013.","Activities; m-Internet; social interaction; technology adoption; technology diffusion",,,,,,"FundaÃ§Ã£o para a CiÃªncia e a Tecnologia, FCT

Deliberate missed calls (DMC) are made with the intention that the receiver is not to answer them. Although this multiregional and multicultural practice is described in different countries, no specific study has been carried out on its use by the older population. To address this absence, this article explores the significance of using deliberate missed calls among seniors. There are three main conclusions. First, personal abilities and external support shape the way seniors use DMC. Second, seniors may abandon, or at least redefine, the use of deliberate missed calls if they change to a flat-rate contract. Finally, the focus on an already old innovation such as DMC allows us to observe the importance of accounting for the heterogeneity of older people if we are to properly analyze their mobile communication practices. © 2013, © The Author(s) 2013.","Case study; deliberate missed calls (DMC); mobile telephony; older population",,,,,,,,,"Bakardjieva, M., (2005) Internet society: The Internet in everyday life, , London, UK, SAGE; Ball-Rokeach, S.J., The origins of individual media-system dependency: A sociological framework (1985) Communication Research, 12 (4), pp. 485-510; Castells, M., Fernández-Ardèvol, M., Linchuan Qiu, J., Sey, A., (2006) Mobile communication and society: A global perspective, , Cambridge, MA, The MIT Press; Charness, N., Parks, D.C., Sabel, B.A., (2001) Communication, technology and aging: Opportunities and challenges for the future, , New York, NY, Springer, (Eds.).

Through an analysis of qualitative interviews, the goal of this study is to draw from the concepts of hybrid space, spatial legibility, and gamification to show how Foursquare’s gaming elements can add a playful layer to physical spaces and discuss the impacts of the application designers’ goal of turning “life into a game.” © 2013, © The Author(s) 2013.","Foursquare; LBMGs; LBSNs; mobility",,,,,,,,,"(2012) Foursquare, , https://foursquare.com/about/, Retrieved from; Bogost, I., Gamification is bullshit (2011) The Atlantic, , http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2011/08/gamification-is-bullshit/243338/, Retrieved from; Brewer, J., Dourish, P., Storied spaces: Cultural accounts of mobility, technology, and environmental knowing (2008) International Journal of Human-Computer Studies, 66 (12), pp. 963-976; Bull, M., (2000) Sounding out the city: Personal stereos and the management of everyday life, , Oxford, UK, Berg; Charmaz, K., (2006) Constructing grounded theory: A practical guide through qualitative analysis, , London, UK, Sage Publications; Crowley, D., Interview with Dennis Crowley of Foursquare – turning life into a game (2010) Intruders-Inside Innovation, , http://intruders.tv/en-tech/interview-with-dennis-crowley-of-foursquare-turning-life-into-a-game/, Retrieved from; de Souza e Silva, A., From cyber to hybrid: Mobile technologies as interfaces of hybrid spaces (2006) Space and Culture, 3, pp. 261-278; de Souza e Silva, A., Alien revolt: A case-study of the first location-based mobile game in Brazil (2008) IEEE Technology and Society Magazine, 27 (1), pp. 18-28; de Souza e Silva, A., Hybrid reality and location-based gaming: Redefining mobility and game spaces in urban environments (2009) Simulation & Gaming, 40 (3), pp. 404-424; de Souza e Silva, A., Frith, J., Locative mobile social networks: Mapping communication and location in urban spaces (2010) Mobilities, 5 (4), pp. 485-505; de Souza e Silva, A., Frith, J., (2012) Mobile interfaces in public spaces: Locational privacy, control and urban sociability, , New York, NY, Routledge; de Souza e Silva, A., Hjorth, L., Playful urban spaces: A historical approach to mobile games (2009) Simulation and Gaming, 40 (5), pp. 602-625; de Souza e Silva, A., Sutko, D., Theorizing locative technologies through philosophies of the virtual (2011) Communication Theory, 21 (1), pp. 23-42; de Souza e Silva, A., Sutko, D.M., Playing life and living play: How hybrid reality games reframe space, play, and the ordinary (2008) Critical Studies in Media Communication, 25 (5), pp. 447-465; de Souza e Silva, A., Sutko, D.M., (2009) Digital cityscapes: Merging digital and urban playspaces, , New York, NY, Peter Lang, (Eds.).

Social Networking Sites (SNSs) are becoming increasingly popular among early adolescents with the majority using them to stay in contact with existing friends. In addition, many adolescents use a range of mobile devices to access these sites. The present study compared feelings of belonging to the friendship group between SNS users who used a mobile device and those who did not. A self-report questionnaire was completed by 337 early adolescent SNS users (11–13 years, mean age = 12.28 years, SD = 0.73). Mobile device users were found to have significantly higher levels of belonging than non-mobile device users and this relationship was partially mediated by the frequency of use of SNSs. It is suggested that these mobile devices not only afford an opportunity for increased use of SNSs and therefore increased interaction with friends but that mobile device SNS users feel constantly connected to their friends. © 2013, © The Author(s) 2013.","belonging; connectedness; early adolescence; mobile communication; social networking",,,,,,,,,"Anderson-Butcher, D., Conroy, D.E., Factorial and criterion validity of scores of a measure of belonging in youth development programs (2002) Educational and Psychological Measurement, 62 (5), pp. 857-876; Baumeister, R.F., Leary, M.R., The need to belong – desire for interpersonal attachments as a fundamental human-motiovation (1995) Psychological Bulletin, 117 (3), pp. 497-529; Blair, B.L., Fletcher, A.C., The Only 13-Year-Old on Planet Earth Without a Cell Phone”: Meanings of cell phones in early adolescents’ everyday lives (2011) Journal of Adolescent Research, 26 (2), pp. 155-177; Bornholt, L.J., Social and personal aspects of self knowledge: A balance of individuality and belonging (2000) Learning and Instruction, 10 (5), pp. 415-429; Brennan, M., (2006) Understanding online social network services and risks to youth, , London, Child Exploitation and Online Protection (CEOP) Centre; Brown, B.B., Peer groups and peer culture (1990) At the threshold: The developing adolescent, pp. 171-196. , Feldman, Elliott, (eds), Cambridge, MA, Harvard University Press,.

The data, provided by Cellcom Israel, the country’s largest mobile operator, enabled an analysis of real behavior patterns rather than relying on memories of people who may have been under stress or traumatized during the hostilities, hence unable to accurately recollect this information later on. During both wars, significant changes were noted in the way people used their mobile phones: There was a substantial decrease of calls originating from within a 10-kilometer region along the Israel-Lebanon border and mobile users also made significantly longer calls. However, the decrease in calls during the Lebanon War was more than double that of the decrease in the comparable region along the Gaza border. There was no significant change in the calling patterns of Israelis living outside the directly affected regions. These supposed differences in reaction to a crisis situation (which are congruent with previous mobile phone usage studies following suicide bombings) are analyzed, and questions regarding the validity of the myth of solidarity and bonding among Israelis are raised. © 2013, © The Author(s) 2013.","Gaza war; Israel; Lebanon war; mobile phone; real-time data; social cohesion; solidarity",,,,,,,,,"Almog, O., (2000) The Sabra: The creation of the New Jew, , Berkeley, University of California Press; Anderson, B., (1991) Imagined communities : reflections on the origin and spread of nationalism, , London, UK; New York, Verso; Arian, A., (1995) Security threatened: Surveying Israeli opinion on peace and war, , New York, NY, Cambridge University Press; Aronoff, M.J., Radical change in Israel: A review essay (2001) Political Science Quarterly, 116, pp. 447-453; Auter, P., Portable social groups: Willingness to communicate, interpersonal communication gratifications, and cell phone use among young adults (2007) International Journal of Mobile Communications, 5 (2), pp. 139-156; Bar-Tal, D., Societal beliefs in times of intractable conflict: The Israeli case (1998) International Journal of Conflict Management, 9 (1), pp. 22-50; Bar-On, D., Israeli life between the culture of death and the culture of life (1997) Israel Studies, 2 (2), pp. 88-112; Ben-Dor, G., Pedahzur, A., Hasisi, B., Israel’s national security doctrine under strain: The crisis of the reserve army (2002) Armed Forces & Society, 28 (2), pp. 233-255; Bracken, C., Jeffres, L., Neuendorf, K., Kopfman, J., Moulla, F., How cosmopolites react to messages: America under attack (2005) Communication Research Reports, 22 (1), pp. 47-58; (2011) Statistical abstract of Israel, , http://www.cbs.gov.il/reader/shnatonhnew_site.htm, [online] Retrieved from; Cohen, A.A., Lemish, D., Real time and recall measures of mobile phone use: Some methodological concerns and empirical applications (2003) New Media and Society, 5 (2), pp. 167-184; Cohen, A.A., Lemish, D., When the bombs go off the mobiles ring: The aftermath of terrorist attacks (2005) A sense of place, pp. 117-128. , Nyiri, (ed), Vienna, Passagen Verlag,.

Yet, there is still a lack of research on mobile donation as a new venue of technology-mediated civic engagement. Using nationally representative survey data, this research examines the variations in mobile donation by mobile phone usage patterns and user characteristics such as age, race, and socioeconomic status. Results show that the diversity of mobile phone use and the frequency of relational mobile communication are positively associated with mobile donation. As importantly, mobile donation helps to overcome age, race and SES gaps, giving members of disadvantaged social groups a more accessible tool for civic engagement. Internet donation and mobile donation complement rather than compete with each other. © 2013, © The Author(s) 2013.","civic engagement; digital divides; donation; mobile communication; U&G",,,,,,,,,"Agre, P.E., Real-time politics: The Internet and the political process (2002) The Information Society, 18 (5), pp. 311-331; (2010) FAQ mobile giving, , https://american.redcross.org/site/SPageServer?pagename=%2Fntld_Haiti_text2help_faqs#Q1, Retrieved from:; Andreoni, J., Brown, E., Rischall, I., Charitable giving by married couples (2003) Journal of Human Resources, 38 (1), pp. 111-133; Bekkers, R., Who gives what and when?

Such incidents have ignited moral panics about the proliferation of mobile media because they are seen to facilitate emergent social/spatial interactions that are either unprecedented, or occurring on a scale not hitherto witnessed. While labelling concerns about youth deviance that is, in some measure, enabled or facilitated by mobile communications as “moral panics” is unproductive, it would be equally myopic to disregard the risks that mobile media can pose for youths in certain circumstances.

The world’s first cellular network was created in 1977, but the mobile phone has made history as one of the fastest diffusing communication technologies, reaching nearly six billion subscribers by 2011. The time is right to define mobile media in an effort to better understand mobile communication technologies and their broad implications for the fundamental meanings of media, communication, community, social institutions, and especially society. In this article, I argue that the advent of mobile telephony as a wireless telecommunication system and portable platform for human communication has seemingly transformed the classical definition of mass communication. In fact, mobile media-supported communication, such as mobile news and mobile tweets, has accelerated what communication scholars have described as “the end of mass communication.” The article ends with a call for a holistic view of mobile communication research. © The Author(s) 2013.","Connected-presence; Mass communication; Mobile devices; Mobile internet; Mobile news; Mobile telephony; Network society; Wireless telecommunications system",,,,,,,,,"Benkler, Y., (2006) The Wealth of Networks, , New Haven, CT and London, UK: Yale University Press; Briggs, M., (2009) Journalism Next: A Practical Guide to Digital Reporting and Publishing, , Washington, DC: CQ Press; Castells, M., (1996) The Rise of The Network Society: The Information Age: Economy, Society and Culture, , Cambridge, MA: Oxford University Press; Castells, M., (2006) Mobile Communication and Society: A Global Perspective, , Cambridge, MA: MIT Press; Chaffee, S., Metzger, M., The end of mass communication?

However, to justify public investment, policymakers require a body of theoretically sound, methodologically rigorous, and generalizable, evidence on how mobile technologies can effectively improve basic healthcare service delivery for hard-to-reach, resource-poor populations in developing countries. This essay draws upon prior work, ranging from a review article, an mHealth intervention for Indonesian healthcare workers within the medical infrastructure, to a text-messaging project in Uganda focused on beneficiaries. The argument is organized around theoretical, methodological, and sustainability issues, and proposes suggestions for how the discipline of mobile communication studies can add value to the field of mHealth research in developing countries. © The Author(s) 2013.","Development; Healthcare; ICT; mHealth; Mobiles",,,,,,,,,"Bandura, A., (2003) Self Efficacy. the Exercise of Control, , New York, NY: Freeman; Baxter, L.A., Montgomery, B.M., (1996) Relating: Dialogues and Dialectics, , New York, NY: The Guilford Press; Chib, A., The Aceh Besar midwives with mobile phones project: Design and evaluation perspectives using the information and communication technologies for healthcare development model (2010) Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication, 15 (3), pp. 500-525; Chib, A., Chen, V.H.H., Midwives with mobiles: A dialectical perspective on gender arising from technology introduction in rural Indonesia (2011) New Media & Society, 12 (3), pp. 486-501; Chib, A., Lwin, M.O., Ang, J., Lin, H., Santoso, F., Mobiles and midwives: Improving healthcare communications via mobile phones in Aceh Besar, Indonesia (2008) Asian Journal of Communication, 18 (4), pp. 348-364; Chib, A., Van Velthoven, M., Car, J., MHealth adoption in low-resource environments: A review of the use of mobile healthcare in developing countries Journal of Health Communication, , forthcoming; Chib, A., Wilkin, H., Hoefman, B., Vulnerabilities in mHealth implementation: Ugandan HIV/AIDS SMS campaign Global Health Promotion; Chib, A., Wilkin, H., Leow, X.L., Hoefman, B., Van Bejima, H., Evaluating the effectiveness of a text message HIV/AIDS campaign in North West Uganda (2012) Journal of Health Communication, 17, pp. 146-157; Cole-Lewis, H., Kershaw, T., Text messaging as a tool for behavior change in disease prevention and management (2010) Epidemiologic Reviews, 32 (1), pp. 56-69; Fjeldsoe, B.S., Marshall, A.L., Miller, Y.D., Behavior change interventions delivered by mobile telephone short-message service (2009) American Journal of Preventive Medicine, 36 (2), pp. 165-173; Free, C., Phillips, G., Felix, L., Galli, L., Patel, V., Edwards, P., The effectiveness of M-health technologies for improving health and health services: A systematic review protocol (2010) BMC Research Notes, 3 (1), p. 250; Hafkin, N., Huyer, S., Women and gender in ICT statistics and indicators for development (2007) The MIT Press, 4 (2), pp. 25-41; Kahn, J.G., Yang, J.S., Kahn, J.S., Mobile’ health needs and opportunities in developing countries (2010) Health Affairs, 29 (2), pp. 252-258; Krishna, S., Boren, S.A., Balas, E.A., Healthcare via cell phones: A systematic review (2009) Journal of Telemedicine and E-Health, 15 (3), pp. 231-240; Lee, S., Chib, A., Kim, J.-N., Midwives’ mobile phone use and health knowledge in rural communities (2011) Journal of Health Communication, 16 (9), pp. 1006-1023; Leslie, I., Sherrington, S., Dicks, D., Gray, N., Chang, T.-T., (2011) Mobile Communications for Medical Care: A Study of Current and Future Healthcare and Health Promotion Applications, and Their Use in China and Elsewhere, , Cambridge, UK: University of Cambridge; Lim, M.S., Hocking, J.S., Hellard, M.E., Aitken, C.K., SMS STI: A review of the uses of mobile phone text messaging in sexual health (2008) International Journal of STD & AIDS, 19 (5), pp. 287-290; Ling, R., Campbell, S.W., (2009) The Reconstruction of Space and Time: Mobile Communication Practices, , New Brunswick, NJ: Transaction Publishers; Mechael, P., The case for mHealth in developing countries (2009) Innovations: Technology, Governance, Globalization, 4 (1), pp. 103-118; Mechael, P.N., Batavia, H., Kaonga, N., Searle, S., Kwan, A., Fu, L., Ossman, J., Barriers and gaps affecting mHealth in low and middle income countries: Policy white paper (2010) Center for Global Health and Economic Development, , Earth Institute, Columbia University; Riley, W.T., Rivera, D.E., Atienza, A.A., Nilsen, W., Allison, S.M., Mermelstein, R., Health behavior models in the age of mobile interventions: Are our theories up to the task?

Second, several key theoretical questions are identified for future exploration, including micro, meso, and macro-level theories.

What’s mobile about cell phones and other current mobile media is a new range of contexts in which personally meaningful and socially consequential interactions become possible. Mobile media should be studied, above all, as resources of social action across physical space. Mobile media, further, provide the wider field of research with an opportunity to revisit the great divide between technologically mediated and embodied communication. Technologically mediated communication remains grounded in human bodies residing in local places. Humans can be understood as a first degree of media whose communicative and performative reach has been extended in time and space by historically shifting technologies. © The Author(s) 2013.","Action; Embodied communication; Mobility; Place; Social structuration; Space; Ubiquity",,,,,,,,,"Austin, J.L., (1962) How to Do Things with Words, , Oxford, UK: Oxford University Press; Bell, D., Kennedy, B.M., (2000) The Cybercultures Reader, , London, UK: Routledge; Benedikt, M., (1991) Cyberspace: First Steps, , Cambridge, MA: MIT Press; Carey, J.W., A cultural approach to communication (1989) In Communication as Culture, pp. 13-36. , Boston, MA: Unwin Hyman.

Social distance is the cultural imaginary within which an individual’s coordinates of social status and contingent social location allow or inhibit contact with similarly and dissimilarly located others. The rearrangement of customary social distances by new communication technologies is a source of considerable social anxiety. In mobile communication, this context collapse is instigated by a distinctive combination of affordances: deep connectivity, the accelerated speed and volume of communicative exchange, enhanced social legibility and asymmetric communicative transparency. Robust and effective levels of social trust depend on a political will to build strong democratic accountability and civil rights guarantees into emerging mobile architectures. Identifying specific recalibrations of familiar social distances by regimes of mobile communication and assessing the effects of these recalibrations in democratic terms is a central task of mobile research. © The Author(s) 2013.","Asymmetric transparency; Connectivity; Context collapse; Legibility; Mobile communication; Social distance; Social trust",,,,,,,,,"Bush, V., (1945) As We May Think.

People use their cell phones to find nearby restaurants and friends in the vicinity, and track their children. Although location-based services have received sparse attention from mobile communication scholars to date, the ability to locate people and things with one’s cell phone is not new. Since the removal of GPS signal degradation in 2000, artists and researchers have been exploring how location-awareness influences mobility, spatiality, and sociability. Besides exploring the historical antecedents of today’s location-based services, this article focuses on the main social issues that emerge when location-aware technologies leave the strict domain of art and research and become part of everyday life: locational privacy, sociability, and spatiality. Finally, this article addresses two main topics that future mobile communication research that focuses on location-awareness should take into consideration: a shift in the meaning of location, and the adoption and appropriation of location-aware technologies in the global south. © The Author(s) 2013.","Global south; Location; Locational privacy; Locative media; Mobile technologies; Sociability; Spatiality; Surveillance",,,,,,,,,"Bar, F., Pisani, F., Weber, M., Mobile technology appropriation in a distant mirror: Baroque infiltration, creolization and cannibalism (2007) Paper Presented at the Seminario Sobre Desarrollo Económico, Desarrollo Social Y Comunicaciones Móviles En América Latina, , Buenos Aires, Argentina; Boesen, J., Rode, J., Mancini, C., The domestic panopticon: Location tracking in families (2010) Paper Presented at the Ubicomp 2010, , Copenhagen, Denmark; Brown, B., Green, N., Harper, R., (2002) Wireless World: Social and Interactional Aspects of the Mobile Age, , London, UK: Springer Verlag; Cresswell, T., (2004) Place: A Short Introduction, , Malden, MA: Blackwell; de Souza E Silva, A., Mobile networks and public spaces: Bringing multiuser environments into the physical space (2004) Convergence, 10 (2), pp. 15-27; de Souza E Silva, A., From cyber to hybrid: Mobile technologies as interfaces of hybrid spaces (2006) Space and Culture, 3, pp. 261-278. , Link; de Souza E Silva, A., The dawn of location-based services in Brazil (2011) Paper Presented at the Association of Internet Researchers (Aoir) 12.0 Annual Conference, , Seattle, WA; de Souza E Silva, A., Frith, J., Locational privacy in public spaces: Media discourses on location-aware mobile technologies (2010) Communication, Culture & Critique, 3 (4), pp. 503-525; de Souza E Silva, A., Frith, J., (2012) Mobile Interfaces in Public Spaces: Locational Privacy, Control and Urban Sociability, , New York, NY: Routledge; Dourish, P., Bell, G., (2011) Divining a Digital Future: Mess and Mythology in Ubiquitous Computing, , Boston, MA: MIT Press; Gergen, K., The challenge of absent presence (2002) Perpetual Contact: Mobile Communication, Private Talk, Public Performance, pp. 227-241. , Katz J., Aakhus M.

Some of the difficulties that will need to be addressed when this occurs are noted. © The Author(s) 2013.","Human communication; Mobile communications; Moral order; Overload; Sociology",,,,,,,,,"Harper, R., (2011) Texture: Human Expression in the Age of Communications Overload, , Cambridge, MA: MIT Press; Simmel, G., How is society possible?

This field has been establishing itself through a number of other initiatives as well, including conferences, symposiums, edited books, listservs, and centers for research. Despite this momentum, little attention has been given to defining – and justifying – the field itself. This essay begins by questioning whether there really is, or should be, a distinct field of study for research and theory on mobile media and communication. I then proceed to address this question by highlighting themes in the literature that illustrate how mobile communication is distinct from other forms of mediated communication and information exchange, with correspondingly distinctive social consequences. The essay argues that there are indeed justifiable reasons for treating mobile communication studies as a field. However, like the technology itself, this field is – or at least should be – highly integrated with research and theory of media and communication more broadly. © The Author(s) 2013.","Cell phone; Field of study; Mobile communication; Mobile communication studies; Mobile media; Mobile phone",,,,,,,,,"Campbell, S.W., Mobile technology and the body: Apparatgeist, fashion, & function (2008) Handbook of Mobile Communication Studies, pp. 153-164. , Katz J.
