We asked twenty-four professional conference interpreters to simultaneously interpret an aurally and visually presented text with controlled incongruences in three categories (numbers, names and control words), while measuring interpreting accuracy and eye movements. The results provide evidence for the dominance of the visual modality, which goes against the professional standard of following the auditory modality in the case of incongruence. Numbers enjoyed the greatest accuracy across conditions possibly due to simple cross-language semantic mappings. We found no evidence for a facilitation effect for congruent items, and identified an impeding effect of the presence of the visual text for incongruent items. These results might be interpreted either as evidence for the Colavita effect (in which visual stimuli take precedence over auditory ones) or as strategic behaviour applied by professional interpreters to avoid risk. © John Benjamins Publishing Company","Incongruence; Multimodal processing; Multisensory processing; Simultaneous interpreting; Visual modality",,,,,,,,"Braun, S., Clarici, A., Inaccuracy for numerals in simultaneous interpretation: Neurolinguistic and neuropsychological perspectives (1996) Interpreting, 7, pp. 85-102; Cammoun, R., Davies, C., Ivanov, K., Naimushin, B., Simultaneous interpretation with text (2009) Is the Text 'Friend' or 'Foe'?

Working in the age of mechanical labour and mechanical typewriters, Bianciardi translated at incredible speed, putting in physically exhausting daily shifts. Not surprisingly, he articulated a vision of his trade that associated it with the physical effort of shifting heavy loads of mud - a job he had seen performed by labourers in his native Tuscany. However, he saw the process of 'turning over' this linguistic mud as no mere slavish effort: just as he 'infected' his original writings with his own target texts, Bianciardi consciously imbued his translations with his personality and his style. © John Benjamins Publishing Company","English-Italian translation; Luciano Bianciardi; Material culture; Metaphors of translation; The translator's turn; Translation; Translation as intervention",,,,,,,,"Allen, P., Trollope to his readers: The unreliable narrator of an autobiography (1996) Biography, 19 (1), pp. 1-18. , https://doi.org/10.1353/bio.2010.0281; Angelini, M.C., (1980) Bianciardi, , Firenze: La Nuova Italia; Angelini, M.C., La fatica del traduttore (2000) Bianciardi, pp. 135-141. , 2000; Bassnett, S., Bush, P., (2006) The Translator as Writer, , eds.

While the novel is considered by many to be the most famous lesbian story published in the 20th century, it can also be read as a narrative with a transgender protagonist. This is in part supported by the fact that the hero of the story is born with a female body but is named Stephen, creating a sense of gendered dissonance throughout the novel. This article asks what happens when this masculine name changes into a feminine one in translation, and explores the sociopolitical circumstances and publishing norms that have motivated this change. © John Benjamins Publishing Company","Censorship; Czech; Gender in translation; Queer translation; The Well of Loneliness; Transgender translation",,,,,,,,"Asimakoulas, D., Dude (Looks like a Lady) (2012) The Translator, 18 (1), pp. 47-75. , https://doi.org/10.1080/13556509.2012.10799501; Baer, B.J., Translating queer texts in Soviet Russia.

While from antiquity through to the eighteenth century, historiography had broadly been considered an artistic and rhetorical activity, this view gradually lost ground in the nineteenth century to an understanding of history as a science. This case study aims to explore how these shifts in attitudes towards the proper aims and methods of history writing might have shaped the interpretation and translation into English of Thucydides' History of the Peloponnesian War, a work first written in classical Greek in the fifth century BCE. The analysis is carried out by means of a corpus-based methodology which, I argue, can better enable researchers to engage with each (re)translator's overall presentation of the source through the production and interrogation of concordances listing every instance of a given search item as it occurs within digitised versions of the target texts. This is demonstrated through an investigation of the use of the term 'fact(s)' which reveals a striking divergence in interpretation between the six translations, with Crawley's (1874) History in particular appearing to lend a significantly more objective and empirical tone to Thucydides in English. © 2020 John Benjamins Publishing Company.

The first study reports on a survey in which 52 researchers in translation and interpreting with experience in empirical research answered questions about their practices in and attitudes toward replication. The survey data were complemented by a bibliometric study of publications indexed in the Bibliography of Interpreting and Translation (BITRA) (Franco Aixelá 2001-2019) that explicitly stated in the title or abstract that they were derived from a replication. In a second bibliometric study, a conceptual replication of Yeung's (2017) study on the acceptance of replications in neuroscience journals was conducted by analyzing 131 translation and interpreting journals. The article aims to provide evidence-based arguments for initiating a debate about the need for replication in empirical translation and interpreting studies and its implications for the development of the discipline. © John Benjamins Publishing Company","Bibliometric approach; Empirical translation and interpreting studies; Methodology; Replication; Survey approach",,,,,,,,"Alves, F., Pagano, A., da Silva, I., Towards an investigation of reading modalities in/for translation: An exploratory study using eye-tracking data (2011) Cognitive Explorations of Translation, pp. 175-196. , edited by Sharon O'Brien, London: Continuum; Baker, M., Penny, D., Is there a reproducibility crisis?

In doing so, we start from a critique of bivalent thinking – rooted in classical logic – exposing unidimensionality as its fundamental weakness. We then consider how this problem has traditionally been addressed by proposing continua. While recognising their cognitive, heuristic and didactic values, we argue that despite the promise of alleviating strict polarisation symptomatic of binarisms, continua are still unidimensional and thus counterproductive to theorising that seeks to capture translational complexity. As a way out of this impasse, building on the premises of fuzzy logic and the understanding that translation is a non-zero-sum concept, we suggest that theoretical concepts be couched in terms of multidimensionality (that is, contrasted with numerous oppositions, rather than a single one, as is the case with polar thinking). Finally, we suggest how our proposed approach can be translated into a practice of theorising. © John Benjamins Publishing Company","Binary; Classical logic; Continuum; Dimension; Fuzzy logic; Multidimensional; Translation theory; Zero-sum thinking",,,,,,,,"Abbott, E.A., (1992) Flatland: A Romance of Many Dimensions, , 1884 Mineola, NY: Dover Publications; Appiah, K.A., Thick translation (1993) Callaloo, 16 (4), pp. 808-819. , https://doi.org/10.2307/2932211; Arduini, S., Nergaard, S., Translation: A new paradigm (2011) Translation, 1, pp. 8-15. , inaugural; Baker, M., Resisting state terror: Theorizing communities of activist translators and interpreters (2009) Globalization, Political Violence and Translation, pp. 222-242. , https://doi.org/10.1057/9780230235410_12, edited by Esperanca Bielsa and Christopher W.

Protection of ethnic kins in Crimea against their local “fascist” government is even invoked to justify the annexation of the peninsula in March 2014. A narrative analysis of a corpus consisting of 770 English and French newspaper articles and 39 translations demonstrates how the Russian news translation website InoSMI re-interprets Western reports on the Crimean crisis by triggering “deep memory” (Wertsch 2008a, 2008b) of the Great Patriotic War. Through selective appropriation, translation shifts and manipulation of visual material, the internet portal highlights particular aspects of the WW II narrative template that activate simplified schemata opposing Russian “patriots” and Ukrainian “fascists.” The paper thus underscores the role of news translation as ideological memory-work. © John Benjamins Publishing Company","Crimea; Fascism; Great Patriotic War; Memory; Narrative; News translation; Russia; Soviet victory; Ukraine",,,,,,,,"Baker, M., (2006) Translation and Conflict: A Narrative Account, , https://doi.org/10.4324/9780203099919, London: Routledge; Brodzki, B., (2007) Can These Bones Live?

We asked 24 professionals and 15 trainees to sight translate sentences with subject-relative clauses and more difficult object-relative clauses while measuring translation accuracy, eye movements and translation durations. We found that trainees took longer to achieve similar translation accuracy as professionals and viewed the source text less than professionals to avoid interference, especially when reading more difficult object-relative sentences. Syntactic manipulation modulated translation and viewing times: participants took longer to translate object-relative sentences but viewed them less in order to avoid interference in target language reformulations. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to show that reading measures in sight translation should be analysed together with translation times to explain complex reading patterns. It also proposes a new measure, percentage of dwell time, as an index of interference avoidance. © John Benjamins Publishing Company","Eye-tracking; Interpreter; Interpreting trainee; Sight translation; Syntactic processing",,,,,,,,"Agrifoglio, M., Sight translation and interpreting: A comparative analysis of constraints and failures (2004) Interpreting, 6 (1), pp. 43-67. , https://doi.org/10.1075/intp.6.1.05agr; Andrews, G., Birney, D., Halford, G.S., Relational processing and working memory capacity in comprehension of relative clause sentences (2006) Memory & Cognition, 34 (6), pp. 1325-1340. , https://doi.org/10.3758/BF03193275; Barr, D.J., Levy, R., Scheepers, C., Tily, H.J., Random effects structure for confirmatory hypothesis testing: Keep it maximal (2013) Journal of Memory and Language, 68 (3), pp. 255-278. , https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jml.2012.11.001; Bates, D., Kliegl, R., Vasishth, S., Baayen, H., (2015) Parsimonious Mixed Models, , https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.04967, Arxiv Preprint; Caplan, D., Vijayan, S., Kuperberg, G., West, C., Waters, G., Greve, D., Dale, A.M., Vascular responses to syntactic processing: Event-related fMRI study of relative clauses (2002) Human Brain Mapping, 15 (1), pp. 26-38. , https://doi.org/10.1002/hbm.1059; Caplan, D., Waters, G., Memory mechanisms supporting syntactic comprehension (2013) Psychonomic Bulletin & Review, 20 (2), pp. 243-268. , https://doi.org/10.3758/s13423‑012‑0369‑9; Chmiel, A., In search of the working memory advantage in conference interpreting – Training, experience and task effects (2018) International Journal of Bilingualism, 22 (3), pp. 371-384. , https://doi.org/10.1177/1367006916681082; Chmiel, A., Janikowski, P., Cieślewicz, A., The eye or the ear?

One English translation renders it as a heterolingual SL-TL pun, which is made comprehensible for TT readers without using footnotes and without distorting the culture of the ST. The SL item in this pun is seamlessly integrated into the TT’s linguistic environment at the morpho-syntactic level and is provided with layers of scaffolding at varied linguistic levels which are naturally presented as if they are a part of textual message. This heterolingual pun is analyzed as a manifestation of translanguaging. The paper proposes a research methodology whereby translanguaging perspectives are applied to translation studies in order to explain varied heterolingual translation phenomena, including foreignization. © John Benjamins Publishing Company","Dialect; Foreignization; Heterolingualism; Intercultural communication; Japanese; Multilingualism; Puns; Translanguaging; Translation; Wordplay",,,,,,,,"Baynham, M., Lee, T.-K., (2019) Translation and Translanguaging, , https://doi.org/10.4324/9781315158877, London: Routledge; Cheung, M.P.Y., Translation as intercultural communication: Views from the Chinese discourse on translation (2014) A Companion to Translation Studies, pp. 179-190. , https://doi.org/10.1002/9781118613504.ch13, edited by Sandra Bermann and Catherine Porter, Chichester: Wiley Blackwell; Connors, C., (1904) Bowery Life, , https://www.gutenberg.org/files/45476/45476-h/45476-h.htm, New York: Richard K.

As a major site of ideology, the televised premier’s press conferences in China represent such a discursive event, enabling the Chinese government to convey its discursive formations or “regime of truth” (Foucault 1984) and in doing so to manufacture consent. Benefitting from a corpus containing 20 years of China’s Premier-Meets-the-Press conference data (1998–2017), this corpus-based critical discourse analysis (CDA) study explores the government-affiliated interpreters’ mediation and (re)construction of China’s discourse on PEOPLE. The interpreters are found to reinforce China’s discourse on PEOPLE (e.g., increased mentions of PEOPLE-related items) and (re)construct a more positive image of Beijing being people-oriented and concerned with its people in English (e.g., the repeated employment of ‘our people’). An examination of the collocational patterns relating to the item ‘people’ (e.g., people’s, of/to/for/ by*people) (re)presented in the English discourse sheds light on the government‒people ties in China. This article highlights the government interpreters’ vital agency role in image (re)construction and in contributing to the government’s political legitimation and hegemonic rule, particularly given the increasingly mediat(is)ed world we live in. © John Benjamins Publishing Company","Corpus-based CDA; Discourse on people; Hegemony; Interpreter mediation; Manufacturing consent; Political discourse; Political legitimation; Political press conferences; Premier’s press conferences",,,,,,,,"Alexander, M., Davies, M., (2015) Hansard Corpus 1803–2005, , http://www.hansard-corpus.org; Althusser, L., (1971) Lenin and Philosophy and Other Essays, , Delhi: Aakar; Anthony, L., (2014) AntConc (Version 3.4.4) [Computer Software], , https://www.laurenceanthony.net/software, Tokyo: Waseda University; Baker, P., Representations of islam in British broadsheet and tabloid newspapers 1999–2005 (2010) Language and Politics, 9 (2), pp. 310-338. , https://doi.org/10.1075/jlp.9.2.07bak; Baker, P., Gabrielatos, C., Khosravinik, M., Krzyzanowski, M., McEnery, T., Wodak, R., A useful methodological synergy?

In addition to analysing the context in which the first translation into Castilian Spanish was published, consideration is given to the transformative moves that the original text and the Broadway and Hollywood rewritings of the diary underwent when they were made available in Spain in the second half of the 1950s. Special attention is paid to the discursive reconfiguration of the mythicised view built around the figure of Anne Frank in the United States and to its challenge and exploitation in the ultra-Catholic years of Franco’s regime. In that sense, one of the major driving forces behind this paper is answering the question of whether or not the reception of this text in Francoist Spain was affected by the fact that its author was an adolescent, a Jew, and a woman. © John Benjamins Publishing Company","Americanisation; Anne Frank; Franco regime; Reception; Rewriting; Translation",,,,,,,"This research was partially supported ACIS&GALATEA (Ref.

It focuses on the use of self-repair, a textual expression of the norm, by male and female interpreters. Two research questions are examined: (1) whether the extent to which self-repairs occur in interpreting is gendered and (2) whether gender influences the way in which the output is repaired using editing terms. Considering the literature on gender and norm-compliance, female interpreters are expected to produce more self-repairs and editing terms than male interpreters. The research is based on the 2008 subcorpus of EPICG with French source speeches and their English and Dutch interpretations. The interpreters’ self-repairs were manually identified and statistically compared. Regarding the first question, it appears that gender influences the use of self-repairs in interpreting. As for the second one, statistical analysis reveals language-based patterns: in the English booth, women use significantly more editing terms than men. The French/Dutch subcorpus yields no significant difference. However, women seem to also use apologies as editing terms. © John Benjamins Publishing Company","Gender studies; Interpreting studies; Norms; Self-repairs; Simultaneous interpreting",,,,,,,,"Bachy, S., Dister, A., Francard, M., Geron, G., Giroul, V., Hambye, P., Simon, A.-C., Wilmet, R., (2007) Conventions De Transcription Régissant Les Corpus De La Banque De Données VALIBEL [Conventions to Transcribe Corpora in the VALIBEL Database], , https://www.uclouvain.be/cps/ucl/doc/valibel/documents/conventions_valibel_2004.PDF, Accessed October 15, 2013; Bakti, M., Bóna, J., Self-monitoring processes in simultaneous interpreting (2016) FORUM.

It suggests that there are parallels between the political issues recognised by translation scholars – of exclusion, misrepresentation and speaking for ‘the other’ – and those raised by biosemiotics, the study of signs in all living systems. Following a discussion of convergence in current developments in translation studies, semiotics and human-animal studies, the article presents an analysis of empirical data, with specific reference to the different meanings of the verb hear. The findings demonstrate the anthropocentric assumptions that are embedded in the way hearing is routinely represented, and an argument is presented for the recognition of these in communications about the semiotic resources relevant to nonhuman life forms. The paper concludes with some reflections on the implications of these issues for the enterprise of translation. © John Benjamins Publishing Company","Biosemiotics; Corpus assisted analysis; Human-animal studies; Politics of translation; Semiosis",,,,,,"Leverhulme Trust","The corpus of language about animals was compiled as part of the project ‘People’, ‘products’, ‘pests’ and ‘pets’ – the discursive representation of animals, funded by the Leverhulme Trust (RPG 2013–063?.

More than just a simple story of cross-cultural exchange, the globalization of the series allows for a look into the ways editors and translators in different cultures handle translation as a cultural and economic opportunity. This article focuses on the Gordian knot that links translation to culturally specific preferences. Combining interviews with a comparative study of the different solutions to the translation of literary and visual elements used in Uncle Leo, it explores the relations between entrepreneurship and culture, the politics of culture, and the universality/cultural specificity of imagination and of being a child. © John Benjamins Publishing Company","Author-entrepreneur; Children's literature; China; Entrepreneurship and culture; Images of children; Israel; Japan; Multiple global centers; Polysystem theory; South-Korea",,,,,,,"The author would like to thank Yannets Levi, Yaniv Shimoni and Merav Shaul in Israel, and Motai Nats?, Koga Mari, Mieda Akiko and Takai Yoshikazu in Japan, for their generous support of this project.

Twenty-six MA translation students from a UK university were asked to translate three English texts with different complexity into Chinese. Their eye movements were recorded by an eye-tracker, and their cognitive load was self-assessed with a Likert scale before translation and NASA-TLX scales after translation. The results show that: (i) the intrinsic complexity measured by readability, word frequency and non-literalness was in line with the results received from informants’ subjective assessment of translation difficulty; (ii) moderate and positive correlations existed between most items in the self-assessments and the indicator (fixation and saccade durations) obtained by the eye-tracking measurements; and (iii) the informants’ cognitive load as indicated by fixation and saccade durations (but not for pupil size) increased significantly in two of the three texts along with the increase in source text complexity. © John Benjamins Publishing Company.","Cognitive load; Eye-tracking; Self-assessment; Text complexity; Translation difficulty",,,,,,"14CWXJ29","This research is supported by Social Science Planning Program of Shandong Province (14CWXJ29? and Durham University Seedcorn Research Funding (04.14.290201?.","Akbari, A., Segers, W., Translation difficulty: How to measure and what to measure (2017) Lebende Sprachen, 62 (1), pp. 3-29. , https://doi.org/10.1515/les‑2017‑0002; Ashby, J., Rayner, K., Clifton, C., Eye movements of highly skilled and average readers: Differential effects of frequency and predictability (2005) The Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology Section A, 58 (6), pp. 1065-1086. , https://doi.org/10.1080/02724980443000476; Cain, B., (2007) A Review of the Mental Workload Literature, , Technical Report, Defence Research and Development Canada Toronto; Campbell, S., A cognitive approach to source text difficulty in translation (1999) Target, 11 (1), pp. 33-63. , https://doi.org/10.1075/target.11.1.03cam; Carpenter, P.A., Just, M.A., The role of working memory in language comprehension (1989) Complex Information Processing: The Impact of Herbert A.

In an eye-tracking and keystroke logging experiment, we compared three conditions, namely full texts, three-sentence sequences and single sentences as source items. The results suggest that translations of single sentences differ significantly from full texts, whereas three-sentence sequences are representative of the full text condition. Therefore, research in process-based translation studies might benefit from using shorter source texts without endangering the ecological validity of experiments. © John Benjamins Publishing Company.","Experiment design; Literal translation; Source text length; Translation experiments",,,,,,"Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG

Much of the discussion regarding these forms of web-based translation has tended to focus on what brings individuals together to give up their time, skills and effort when co-operating within such prosumer-led projects. By contrast, this paper presents a case study focused on the construction of the English Wikipedia article about Tokyo in order to argue that it is important for translation scholars to additionally take into account the difficult processes of fierce conflict and debate which often characterise interactions within such communities. It does so by means of the spatial mode of analysis encouraged by Foucault’s writings on ‘heterotopia’, demonstrating how this conceptual method can be applied to explain and explore the multifaceted negotiations that occur in this environment. © John Benjamins Publishing Company.","Collaborative translation; Digital culture; Heterotopia; Virtual communities; Volunteer translation; Wikipedia",,,,,,,,"(2018) Top Sites, , https://www.alexa.com/topsites, Accessed April 18; Baker, M., (2011) Other Words: A Coursebook on Translation. 2nd Edition, , https://doi.org/10.4324/9780203832929, London: Routledge; Baker, M., Translation as an alternative space for political action (2013) Social Movement Studies: Journal of Social, Cultural and Political Protest, 12 (1), pp. 23-47. , https://doi.org/10.1080/14742837.2012.685624; Contributors, , http://corporate.britannica.com/about/contributors/, Accessed April 12, 2018; Britannica Today, , http://corporate.britannica.com/about/today/, Accessed April 12, 2018; Trusted Information, , http://corporate.britannica.com/slider/trusted-information/, Accessed April 12, 2018; Bruns, A., (2008) Blogs, Wikipedia, Second Life and Beyond: From Production to Produsage, , New York: Peter Lang; Čemerin, V., Toth, M., An exploration of motives for fansubbing based on several Croatian fansubbing communities (2017) Non-Professional Subtitling, pp. 199-234. , edited by David Orrego-Carmona and Yvonne Lee, Newcastle-upon-Tyne: Cambridge Scholars Publishing; Cronin, M., Simon, S., Introduction: The city as translation zone (2014) The Translator, 7 (2), pp. 119-132; Demirkol-Ertürk, Ş., Paker, S., Beyoğlu/pera as a translating site in Istanbul (2014) The Translator, 7 (2), pp. 170-185; Dombek, M., (2014) A Study into the Motivations of Internet Users Contributing to Translation Crowdsourcing: The Case of Polish Facebook User-Translators, , PhD diss.

However, for Sweden, which has a long and strong tradition of prosubs (commissioned professional subtitles), there have hardly been any studies of this increasingly prolific phenomenon. This paper seeks to remedy this situation by investigating 16 subtitled versions of ten English-language films. The analysis uses the FAR model of quality assessment and also investigates other aspects, such as creativity. The results show that there is great variety between the various fansubbed versions. On average, Swedish fansubs are found to be of lower quality, less adhering to norms and also more abusively faithful than prosubs. Moreover, the fansubs in this study are hardly creative at all. This could be due to fansubbing being a rather marginal phenomenon in Sweden, the land of subtitling. © John Benjamins Publishing Company.","Acceptability; Creativity; Fansubs; Functional equivalence; Quality assessment; Readability; Subtitling",,,,,,,,"Subtitling Freeware, , www.aegisub.org, Accessed August 10, 2017; Antonini, R., Bucaria, C., (2015) Non-Professional Interpreting and Translation in the Media, , Frankfurt am Main: Peter Lang; Bączkowska, A., Quantitative Study of Non-professional Subtitles and Implications for Corpus-Based Translator Training (2015) Antonini and Bucaria, 2015, pp. 89-111; Bold, B., The power of fan communities: An overview of fansubbing in Brazil (2012) Tradução Em Revista, 11 (2), pp. 1-19; Bruti, S., Zanotti, S., Non-professional subtitling in close-up: A study of interjections and discourse markers (2015) Antonini and Bucaria, 2015, pp. 231-256; Caffrey, C., Using an eye-tracking tool to measure the effects of experimental subtitling procedures on viewer perception of subtitled AV content (2012) Eye Tracking in Audiovisual Translation, pp. 223-258. , edited by Elisa Perego, Rome: Aracne; Chesterman, A., Memes of translation (1997) The Spread of Ideas in Translation Theory, , https://doi.org/10.1075/btl.22, Amsterdam: John Benjamins; Cubbison, L., Anime fans, DVDs, and the authentic text (2005) The Velvet Light Trap, 56, pp. 45-57. , https://doi.org/10.1353/vlt.2006.0004; Denison, R., Anime fandom and the liminal spaces between fan creativity and piracy (2011) International Journal of Cultural Studies, 14 (5), pp. 449-466. , https://doi.org/10.1177/1367877910394565; Díaz Cintas, J., Sánchez, P.M., FanSuBS: Audiovisual translation in an amateur environment (2006) Journal of Specialized Translation, 6, pp. 37-52; www.divxsweden.net, Swedish online fansubbing community.

To this end, two measures of emotion were used: Galvanic skin response (GSR) as a marker of emotional arousal, and SUPIN - the Polish adaptation of PANAS (Positive and Negative Affect Schedule). A group of interpreters with Polish as their A language and English as their B language (N = 20) took part in the experiment. They were asked to simultaneously interpret two speeches (recordings accompanied by video) from Polish into English: A neutral speech and an emotional speech. The results show that the interpreters are indeed affected by the speaker's emotions, which is reflected in both a greater galvanic skin response and higher SUPIN scores for the emotional speech, when compared to the neutral speech and baseline values. The results may shed new light on the importance of emotion processing in simultaneous interpreting. © 2018 John Benjamins Publishing Company.","Emotional contagion; Emotional responding; Empathy; Galvanic skin response (GSR); Simultaneous interpreting",,,,,,"Fundacja na rzecz Nauki Polskiej, FNP","We thank Łukasz Kaczmarek (Institute of Psychology, Adam Mickiewicz University in Pozna �? for providing access to the equipment necessary to conduct the experiment.

However, political developments led to increasing isolation for the Institute and increasing monolingualism in its journal. By the late 1970s, Memórias had suspended publication and the Institute was on the verge of collapse. Nevertheless, new leadership and a drive towards globalized English helped form Memórias into the most-cited scientific journal in Latin America. This narrative holds important lessons for Translation Studies, the first of which is that the international scientific community, which has historically depended on translation, is worth more careful consideration as an object of study. In this peripheral institute, translation effected international self-projection, which consolidated national prestige through recognition from authorities abroad. Moreover, the questions of power involved in the literature's current English-language hegemony, faced even by former European colonizers, are removed only circumstantially from those dealt with in the periphery a century ago. © John Benjamins Publishing Company.","Colonialism; Language policy; Latin America; Lingua franca; Scientific literature",,,,,,,,"Anderson, B., (1983) Imagined Communities: Reflections on the Origin and Spread of Nationalism., , London: Verso; Aragão, H.D.B., Historical report on the foundation of the Instituto Oswaldo Cruz (1950) Memórias Do Instituto Oswaldo Cruz, 48, pp. 1-50. , https://doi.org/10.1590/S0074-02761950000100001; Barbosa, R., (1917) Osvaldo Cruz: Discurso Pronunciado Na Sessão Cívica de 28 de Maio de 1917, No Teatro Municipal [Oswaldo Cruz: Discourse during the Civic Session of May 28 1917 at the Municipal Theatre]., , Rio de Janeiro: Fundação Casa de Rui Barbosa; Bourdieu, P., (1991) Language and Symbolic Power [Orig.

The article is organized into two main sections. The first one casts some light upon the socio-historical context in which the translations were written by analysing several paratexts (e.g., acknowledgements and introductions).

O. Matthiessen's work on the role of translation during the Elizabethan period, this article delves into the paratexts of the translations of Spanish colonial texts by Richard Hakluyt, Edward Grimeston, Michael Lok and John Frampton to discuss the underlying reasons why Spanish accounts of the conquest were rendered into English. The analysis of the dedications and addresses shows that, although these translations may have served to express admiration for the Spanish conquerors or to criticize their actions, the ultimate goals of these texts were to encourage England to replicate the Spanish empire in the Americas, on the one hand, and to obtain social, political and economic benefits for the translators, on the other. © John Benjamins Publishing Company.","Colonial translation; Edward Grimeston; John Frampton; Michael Lok; Richard Hakluyt; Spanish chronicles",,,,,,,,"De Acosta Acosta, J., (1880) The Natural and Moral History of the Indies [Orig.

Two specific periods, namely the transitional military government from 1898 to 1900 and the first civilian government from 1900 to 1917, provide the framework within which the study is conducted. Analyses of official language and translation policies, as well as historical documents from governmental and educational contexts, illustrate the multiple, conflicting agendas employed by the new colonial power to Americanize the island. Results also demonstrate how codified policies do not fully account for the linguistic and cultural landscape in colonial contexts, thereby requiring closer examination of translation practices and beliefs and their interplay with translation policy. © John Benjamins Publishing Company.","Colonialism; Language policy; Microhistory; Puerto Rico; Spanish-American War; Translation policy",,,,,,"University of North Carolina at Charlotte","This work was supported, in part, by funds provided by the University of North Carolina at Charlotte.

It benefitted from the presence of a particularly dynamic and cohesive group of young men involved in the development of the paper as a means of improving the social and economic situation of a territory extending from Chiapas to Costa Rica. Against a backdrop of censorship, and undeterred by their marginal position vis-à-vis the European centers of knowledge, they managed to include a surprising number of translations and references to foreign works. In conjunction with Colonial Studies, the Translation Studies perspective adopted in this article highlights how the editors of the Gaceta and their close collaborators, far from being passive consumers, managed to use translation as a tool to engage in, and prepare their readership for, dialogue with the Enlightened elites of the Western world. © John Benjamins Publishing Company.","Colonial Spanish America; Early periodical press; Enlightenment; Metadiscourse of translation; Sociological-cultural model",,,,,,,,"Anderson, B., (1999) Imagined Communities: Reflections on the Origin and Spread of Nationalism., , London: Verso; Bassnett, S., Lefevere, A., (1990) Translation, History and Culture, , London: Pinter Publishers; Bastin, G.L., Histoire, traductions et traductologie.

These contexts provide a fertile ground for a sociological conceptualization of interpreting, as an emergent practice situated at the interface of individual agency and a socioprofessional context. Drawing on our experiences in training interpreters for the ICRC and the UNHCR we develop a positionality-based understanding of 'humanitarian interpreting' and define this new analytical category. Based on two paradigmatic profiles of humanitarian interpreters, we present a comparative analysis of the intrinsic and relational factors shaping the positionality of ICRC and UNHCR interpreters in the humanitarian field and describe some of the ethical dilemmas these interpreters face. We furthermore discuss potential similarities and differences between interpreting in humanitarian and other contexts, such as military operations and asylum settings. © John Benjamins Publishing Company.","Conflict zones; Ethics; Humanitarian field; Humanitarian organizations; Interpreter positionality; NPIT",,,,,,,,"Katharine, A., (2012) Interpreting in Conflict Zones, , https://najit.org/interpreting-inconflict-zones/; Baker, C., The care and feeding of linguists: The working environment of interpreters, translators and linguists during peacekeeping in Bosnia-Herzegovina (2010) War & Society, 29 (2), pp. 154-175. , https://doi.org/10.1179/204243410X12674422128993; Baker, M., Translation as an alternative space for political action (2013) Journal of Social, Cultural and Political Protest, 12 (1), pp. 23-47; Mona, B., Maier, C., Ethics in interpreter & translator training (2011) The Interpreter and Translator Trainer, 5 (1), pp. 1-14. , https://doi.org/10.1080/13556509.2011.10798809; Blommaert, J., Investigating narrative inequality: African asylum seekers' stories in Belgium (2001) Discourse & Society, 12 (4), pp. 413-449. , https://doi.org/10.1177/0957926501012004002; Pierre, B., (1977) Outline of A Theory of Practice, , https://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511812507, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press; Pierre, B., Espace social et genèse des 'classes' (1984) Actes de la Recherche en Sciences Sociales, 52-53, pp. 3-14; Pierre, B., (1994) Raisons Pratiques.

It argues that the translator-as-reader's imaginary experience of the world(s) 'from within' activates a variety of manifestations and implementations of narrativity, and affects the interplay between the lyric and narrative modes in the translated lyric poems. Drawing on analytical concepts and methods from cognitive narratology, aesthetic illusion, and reading psychology, this study aims at foregrounding the translator's role as an immersive reader, a ""side-participant"" (Gerrig 1993) in the represented worlds, and at giving an enriched account of what the translator's reading of the original poems involve. © John Benjamins Publishing Company.","Aesthetic illusion; Cognitive narratology; Experientiality; Narrativity in lyric poetry; Narrativization; Poetry translation; Translator as immersive reader",,,,,,,,"The 'moreness' or 'lessness' of 'natural' narratology: Samuel beckett's 'lessness' reconsidered (2002) Style, 36 (1), pp. 54-75. , Jan; Alan, A., Mackintosh, D., (1965) A Collection of Chinese Lyrics.

Just over half of the respondents liked working as telephone interpreters. Results also show that interpreters identified many favourable and unfavourable aspects of telephone interpreting. A key finding is that interpreters perceived many comprehensionrelated challenges (e.g., poor sound quality, a lack of non-verbal information), communication-related challenges (e.g., overlapping speech), and other challenges in telephone interpreting (e.g., low remuneration, casual employment, work-related stress). Importantly, interpreters adopted various coping strategies, including using high-quality headphones and requesting briefing or clarification to deal with comprehension-related challenges, explaining the interpreter's role and intervening with clients as necessary to address communication-related challenges, and reducing working hours and exercising self-care to manage work-related stress. © John Benjamins Publishing Company.","Challenges; Client education; Coping strategies; Professional status; Telephone interpreting; Working conditions",,,,,,,,"Qianya, C., (2015) Examining the Challenges for Telephone Interpreters in New Zealand, , MA diss.

This article argues that these conflicting images are partly due to distinct discourses that reached Portugal through translations of Polish literature. Ultimately, it aims to give insights into the role of literary translation in the construction of a national image abroad. Since all the translations in the corpus are indirect, special attention is paid to the way the mediating texts impacted the image encoded in the target text. The article considers five channels via which texts were imported, presenting the results of a textual analysis of one translation in each of these channels, including its indirect trajectory. The findings confirm the importance of the analysed translations in the construction of the discussed images and show that the mediating texts had a crucial filtering role as regards the transfer of these images. © John Benjamins Publishing Company.","Censorship; Communism; Image studies; Indirect translation; Peripheral languages; Polish literature; Portuguese language; Translation channels",,,,,,,,"Jerzy, A., (1962) Os Inquisidores [The Inquisitors], , Lisboa: Presença; Dobraczynski, J., (1960) Cartas de Nicodemo [Letters by Nicodemus], , Porto: Porto Editora; Witold, G., (1969) Cosmos, , Lisboa: Ulisseia; Jaroslaw, I., (1947) 1975.

This article focuses on the complexities of the interpreters' role and how the beneficiaries of their work perceive it. It reveals that the interpreters' performance is determined by two circumstances: first, it straddles public service and business interpreting; and second, the fact that the interpreters are trained and employed by the State creates tensions in the communication between the latter and the indigenous peoples. The socio-political context and the initiatives designed to ensure compliance with the law will provide a background to our findings. These derive from observation, interviews and meetings with institutional actors and interpreters, and are illustrated by a case study. © 2018 John Benjamins Publishing Company.","Indigenous interpreters; Peru; Prior consultation; Users' expectations",,,,,,"Arts and Humanities Research Council, AHRC

This overlooks interventions by other agents involved in translation such as editors, who may have significant influence on the translated text. In order to study editors' influence on the translation product, this paper presents a comparative analysis of manuscript and published translations, which allows a differentiation of actual translated language and edited translated language. Based on a tripartite parallel corpus of English business articles and their translations into German, I analyse translators' and editors' influence on grammatical metaphoricity of the text, specifically on the use of nominalisations. One finding is that a significant amount of nominalisation is re-verbalised by editors. The results show that translated language may often be the result of significant editorial intervention. Thus, by just considering source text and published translation, our picture of what translators actually do may be significantly distorted. © 2018 John Benjamins Publishing Company.","Corpus-based translation studies; Editing; Grammatical metaphor; Nominalisations; Translation workflow",,,,,,,,"Abney, S.P., (1987) The English Noun Phrase in Its Sentential Aspect, , PhD diss.

However, Bourdieusian approaches to literary translation seem to reproduce a major problem underlying Bourdieu's theory; namely, a deterministic view of human behaviour. This article, against the alleged incompatibility between sociological approaches and culturalist paradigms, proposes to combine Bourdieu's sociology with the notion of transculturation borrowed from Latin American cultural studies. The article demonstrates how transculturation helps elucidating the divided and contradictory nature of the habitus, as it was originally formulated by Bourdieu in his early writings on Kabylian society. Data from my previous study on the translational activity of Dai Wangshu in Republican China are used to illustrate how transculturation reveals itself as a valid model for the study of literary translators through history beyond the limitations of a sociologically-informed approach based exclusively on a Bourdieusian perspective. © 2018 John Benjamins Publishing Company.","Clivé; Culturalist; Dai Wangshu; Daniel Simeoni; Deterministic; Habitus; Literary translation; Sociological; Transculturation; Ángel Rama",,,,,,,"6.

Interpreters involved in such contexts thus perform a communicative pas de quatre, crossing not only the language divide, but also the modal divide (oral vs. written). In this paper, we analyse how an interpreter in a Belgian police interview handles this complex task. It appears that she procedurally and declaratively recognises a written turn in the interaction and uses its authoritative voice to silence the witness by sight-translating the turn as it is being typed on the screen. In line with previous research on interpreters' handling of dialogues (Hale 1997), the interpreter also shapes turns, including the written turn, to the needs of the addressees: upgrading the register properties of the interviewee's talk and downgrading those of the written turn. © 2018 John Benjamins Publishing Company.","Dialogue interpreting; Police interview; Written turn",,,,,,,,"Agrifoglio, M., Sight translation and interpreting: A comparative analysis of constraints and failures (2004) Interpreting, 6 (1), pp. 43-67. , https://doi.org/10.1075/intp.6.1.05agr; Angermeyer, P., Translation style and participant roles in court interpreting (2009) Journal of Sociolinguistics, 13 (1), pp. 3-28. , https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-9841.2008.00394.x; Blanche-Benveniste, C., (1990) Le Français Parlé.

Comparing the two translations with this method identifies which clusters - i.e., repeated sequences of words - are used more frequently by one translator compared to the other. The analysis shows that the two translators differ in their usage of some linguistic features, specifically Italian euphonic -d, locative clitics, and distal demonstratives, which are then analysed as stylistic divergences. © 2018 John Benjamins Publishing Company.","Corpus-based translation studies; English-Italian; Key clusters; Literary translation; Translator style",,,,,,,,"Baker, M., Corpus linguistics and translation studies: Implications and applications (1993) Text and Technology: In Honour of John Sinclair, pp. 233-250. , https://doi.org/10.1075/z.64.15bak, edited by Mona Baker, Gill Francis, and Elena Tognini-Bonelli, Amsterdam: John Benjamins; Baker, M., Towards a methodology for investigating the style of a literary translator (2000) Target, 12 (2), pp. 241-266. , https://doi.org/10.1075/target.12.2.04bak; Baker, P., (2010) Sociolinguistics and Corpus Linguistics, , Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press; Bernardini, S., Reviving old ideas: Parallel and comparable analysis in translation studies - with an example for translation stylistics (2005) New Tendencies in Translation Studies, pp. 5-18. , edited by Karin Aijmer and Cecilia Alvstad, Göteborg: University of Göteborg; Biber, D., Corpus linguistics and the study of literature: Back to the future?

Both scholars and professional translators have attempted to determine medical translators’ profile by making statements about the characteristics of translators with a linguistic background and those of translators with a scientific-medical one. These statements are generally based on intuition or personal experience rather than on empirical data which can be used to back up any kind of evaluation that may be made. This paper aims to bridge this gap by presenting the results of an empirical descriptive study which surveyed practicing medical translators. The survey included questions such as academic qualification, years of experience, customers, genres translated, main difficulties encountered, and degree of self-instruction received, among others. On the basis of these data, this paper approaches the medical translators’ profile and explores the main differences between translators with a linguistic background and translators with a scientific-medical one. The results show that some of the most substantial differences between them relate to the years of experience, difficulties encountered, documentation resources used, and training needs. © John Benjamins Publishing Company.","Empirical descriptive study; Medical translation; Professional practice; Translators with a linguistic background; Translators with a scientific-medical background",,,,,,,,"Albarrán Martín, R., (2012) Traducción Y Medicina: Aspectos Epistemológicos E Interdisciplinares para La Formación De Traductores Especializados En Ciencias De La Salud, , PhD diss.

In doing so, it explores the nature of explanation itself and raises one crucial question: How much is beyond explanation? In other words, to what extent could translational phenomena be due to mere chance? This article addresses this question by drawing on six landmark experiments within the field of psychology. These experiments suggest (1) that we, as translators, might unknowingly be injecting random elements into our translations, and (2) that we, as Translation Studies scholars, might be ‘seeing’ causes in that randomness where there are none. This article also draws on psychologist Daniel Kahneman’s ideas about the ‘illusion of causation’ and on Nassim Taleb’s definition of randomness within the humanities and social sciences. It concludes by arguing that retrospective explanations of translations should pay far more than lip service to the notion of chance. © John Benjamins Publishing Company.","Cognitive errors; Explanation; Randomness; Uncertainty",,,,,,,,"Bassnett, S., Lefevere, A., (1998) Constructing Cultures: Essays on Literary Translation, , Clevedon: Multilingual Matters; Brownlie, S., Investigating explanations of translational phenomena: A case for multiple causality (2003) Target, 15 (1), pp. 111-152. , https://doi.org/10.1075/target.15.1.06bro; Bruno, C., The public life of contemporary Chinese poetry in english translation (2012) Target, 24 (2), pp. 253-285. , https://doi.org/10.1075/target.24.2.03bru; Chesterman, A., Causes, translations, effects (1998) Target, 10 (2), pp. 201-230. , https://doi.org/10.1075/target.10.2.02che; Chesterman, A., On explanation (2008) Beyond Descriptive Translation Studies: Investigations in Homage to Gideon Toury, pp. 363-379. , https://doi.org/10.1075/btl.75.27che, edited by Anthony Pym, Miriam Shlesinger, and Daniel Simeoni, Amsterdam: John Benjamins; Chesterman, A., (2011) On Explanation, , https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53L_g_S_MK0;parttwo, lecture given Universitat Rovira i Virgili, Tarragona, Spain, on February 2, 2011.

Quantitative analysis reveals that there is no significant difference in the overall frequency of occurrence of connectives in translations and non-translations, but the behaviour of connectives in translations is sensitive to the type of semantic relation conveyed. Moreover, the higher frequency of connectives expressing consequence in translations seems to be related to explicitation. Qualitative analysis suggests that explicitation is strongly associated with two factors: The semantic relation conveyed by the connective being part of the common ground shared by participants, and the predominance of the procedural function of the connective. © John Benjamins Publishing Company.","Connectives; Consequence; Contrast; COVALT; Explicitation; Literary translation",,,,,,"1B2013-44

Corpus analysis highlights significant distributional differences in the use of the two aspectual forms of Polish verbs (imperfective and perfective) in modal contexts. I argue that cognitive mechanisms called ‘chunking’ (Langacker 1988; Bybee 2006) and ‘entrenchment’ (Bybee 2010) underlie these differences. I show that what may at first glance seem as behaviour unique to the translation process, is in fact caused by general cognitive processes. The study has implications for both translation studies and cognitive linguistics: It offers support for the basic assumptions about the usage-based nature of linguistic knowledge and highlights the importance of taking these assumptions into consideration when investigating the translation process and translation universals. © John Benjamins Publishing Company.","Aspect; Cognitive linguistics; Corpus-based; Modality; Polish; Translation universals; Usage-based",,,,,,"Johannes Gutenberg-UniversitÃ¤t Mainz, JGU","I would like to thank the audiences at the 2nd Durham Postgraduate Colloquium 2014 in Durham (UK), the 13th International Cognitive Linguistics Conference 2015 at Northumbria University (UK), and the TRA&CO International Symposium on Translation and Cognition 2016 at Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz (Germany).

In this paper we appraise whether the complexity of the translated audiovisual material matters for the cognitive and evaluative reception of subtitled vs. dubbed audiovisual material. To this aim, we present the results of two studies on the viewers’ reception of film translation (dubbing vs. subtitling), in which we investigate the cognitive and evaluative consequences of audiovisual complexity. In Study 1, the results show that a moderately complex film is processed effectively and is enjoyed irrespective of the translation method. In Study 2, the subtitling (vs. dubbing) of a more complex film leads to more effortful processing and lower cognitive performance, but not to a lessened appreciation. These results expose the boundaries of subtitle processing, which are reached only when the audiovisual material to be processed is complex, and they encourage scholars and practitioners to reconsider old standards as well as to invest more effort in crafting diverse types of audiovisual translations tailored both to the degree of complexity of the source product and to the individual differences of the target viewers. © John Benjamins Publishing Company.","Audiovisual translation processing; Comprehension; Dubbing; Evaluation; Film complexity; Memory; Subtitling",,,,,,,,"Barsam, R., (2007) Looking at Movies.

When considering the language pair English-Spanish, personal pronouns seem to be good markers of significant differences (anchor phenomena), since they must obligatorily occur in English, but not in Spanish. To test this hypothesis, empirical data have been extracted from a large reference corpus in Spanish (CREA) and from an English-Spanish parallel corpus (P-ACTRES), in both cases from the fiction subcorpora. Statistically significant differences have been found in some of the uses of personal pronouns, having textual and pragmatic implications in the target texts. The aim is to use the results obtained in the case of personal pronouns, together with results from other linguistic areas, to build a semi-automated tool for the post-editing of Spanish translations of texts written originally in English. © John Benjamins Publishing Company.","Anchor phenomena; Corpora; Personal pronouns; Translation post-editing",,,,,,,,"Alarcos, E., (1980) Estudios De Gramática Funcional, , Madrid: Gredos; Baker, M., Corpus linguistics and translation studies: Implications and applications (1993) Text and Technology.

However, they are still under-researched in the subfield of audiovisual translation. This is strange since this mode of translation, particularly subtitling, has very special conditions which complicate the translating of metaphors, such as the interplay between dialogue, image and subtitles, as well as severe time and space constraints. This paper investigates how metaphors in the British sitcom Yes, Prime Minister were subtitled into Swedish. The results show that subtitlers treat metaphors as an important language feature, less prone to omission than other features. Furthermore, monocultural metaphors, which are not shared between cultures, are subtitled using more strategies than transcultural ones. Metaphors are also subtitled differently depending on the degree of entrenchment. Typically for metaphor translation, there is a loss of metaphor force, but more research is needed to ascertain whether this is media-specific or a general translation effect of growing standardization. © John Benjamins Publishing Company.","Audiovisual translation; Conceptual metaphor; Image transfer; Metaphors; Subtitling; Transculturality; Translation strategies",,,,,,,,"Dagut, M., Can “Metaphor” be translated?

The analysis reveals the central role of translatorial activities: 60% of the turns include some kind of translatoriality. The chair and expert speakers stand out as producers for most of the translations. Self-translation is the most prominent form of translation, but otherwise the translator role tends to vary dynamically with the role of the source text producer. Three types of translatorial action with varying degrees of replication of content were found: duplicating, summarizing, and expanding. In the meeting context, translatorial action is the primary means of enabling participation for all, regardless of language skills or language background, and this action was used by the participants in flexible and dynamic ways. © John Benjamins Publishing Company.","Bilingual meeting; Language practices; Paraprofessional translation; Translatorial action; Translatoriality",,,,,,,,"Bargiela-Chiappini, F., Harris, S., (1997) Managing Language.

It explores this possibility by first interrogating Gérard Genette’s model of literariness in Fiction and Diction –considering how literary translation as a unique genre might fit that model – and then considering what the literary translator imitates, and the relationship between translation and the novel as similar imitative genres. Key to this comparison is the novel’s early (and continuing) reliance on the “found-translation framing device,” which is effectively what Gideon Toury calls a pseudotranslation but is not (necessarily) designed to hide original creation – rather, to play with the illusion of reality. The paper ends with the suggestion that literature tout court might be reimagined in terms of its transformative energies – and that translation might come to be seen as one of literature’s most definitive genres. © John Benjamins Publishing Company.","Genette; Genre; Literariness; Literary translation",,,,,,,,"Baker, M., Towards a methodology for investigating the style of a literary translator (2000) Target, 12 (2), pp. 241-266; Barth, J., The literature of exhaustion (1967) The Friday Book: Essays and Other Non-Fiction, pp. 62-76. , 1984.

The present study fills this void by examining the role of citizenship behaviors in consolidating the translators’ professional identity. The regression analysis of the survey data on 352 translators and interpreters in South Korea shows that citizenship behaviors inside and outside of the profession, such as voluntary services in community events or at a professional association of translators, positively affect their identity. It is also noteworthy that citizenship behaviors, particularly those within the profession, partly moderate the influence of trait factors such as master’s degree and income on identity. This study indicates that participation in social activities beyond the boundaries of one’s translation job can benefit both individual professionals and the professional group as a whole, reinforcing professional identity. This will ultimately contribute to society, in addition to the profession. © John Benjamins Publishing Company.","Citizenship behavior; Extra-role activities; Identity; Interpreter; Power; Profession; Trait; Translator",,,,,,"Hankuk University of Foreign Studies, HUFS","A previous version of this paper was presented at the 2014 KATI meeting in Seoul, South Korea.

We aim to investigate the influence of translation on the structure of semantic fields and in particular the extent to which the structure of the semantic field of inchoativity differs between original, non-translated Dutch and translated Dutch. The visualizations of the semantic field of inchoativity show that translated Dutch indeed differs from non-translated Dutch on the semantic level. Based on the exploration of the semantic fields, we furthermore formulate some hypotheses concerning the presence of the so-called universal tendencies of translation on the semantic level. © John Benjamins Publishing Company.","Corpus-based; Inchoativity; Semantic differences; Semantic field; Statistical; Translation universals; Translational hypothesis",,,,,,,,"Aijmer, K., Simon-Vandenbergen, A.-M., A model and a methodology for the study of pragmatic markers: The semantic field of expectation (2004) Journal of Pragmatics, 36 (10), pp. 1781-1806; Altenberg, B., Granger, S., Recent trends in cross-Linguistic lexical studies (2002) Lexis in Contrast: Corpus-Based Approaches, pp. 3-48. , ed. by Bengt Altenberg and Sylviane Granger, Amsterdam: John Benjamins; Baayen, R.H., (2008) Analyzing Linguistic Data.

It will be argued that the use of for-profit platforms like YouTube and Vimeo by indie creators and translators of video poetry favours the emergence of new translational attitudes, practices and objects that have positive but also contentious effects. One the one hand, these online mediators explore new poetic expressions and tend to make the most of the potential for dissemination of poetic heritage, providing visibility to non-hegemonic literatures. On the other hand, however, these translational digitally-born practices and creations by voluntary and subaltern mediators might reinforce the hegemonic position of large American Internet corporations at the risk of commodifying cultural capital, consolidating English as a lingua franca and perhaps, in the long run, even fostering a potentially monocultural and internationally homogeneous aesthetics. © 2017 John Benjamins Publishing Company.","Literary canon; Power; Translator; Video poetry; Vimeo; YouTube",,,,,,,,"Álvarez, R., Carmen-África Vidal, M., Translating: A political act (1996) Translation, Power, Subversion, pp. 1-9. , ed. by Román Álvarez, and M.

It approaches the development of fansubbing in China as a process of technology democratisation with the potential to liberate ordinary citizens from authoritarian and commercial imperatives, enabling them to contest official state domination. The paper draws on the strategies adopted by fansubbing groups to organise their working practices and interactive social activities with a view to engaging target audiences. Both facets complement each other and bring to the fore the 'gamified' system of fansubbing networks. Gamification enables ordinary citizens to translate, distribute and consume foreign audiovisual products in a strategic move that pits collective activism against government dominance. © 2017 John Benjamins Publishing Company.","China; Domination; Fansubbing; Gamification; Technology",,,,,,,,"Bai, S., (2013) Recent Developments in the Chinese Film Censorship System, , http://opensiuc.lib.siu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1478&context=gs_rp, Research Papers.

However, back in the 1970s, many of Michel Foucault's major texts, which were introduced to the English-speaking public for the first time through Alan Sheridan Smith's translations for Tavistock Publications, were not domesticated at all. Despite the fact that the originals are grounded in a non-empiricist theory of knowledge and use terms drawn from a universe of discourse that would have been completely alien in the English-speaking world, these translations closely follow the patterns of the French, with few or no concessions to the target reader's knowledge and expectations. This paper analyses passages from Sheridan Smith's English translations of Les Mots et les choses and L'Archéologie du savoir in order to discuss the long-term effects of this translation strategy. It then goes on to compare and assess two very different translations of Foucault's lecture L' Ordre du discours (1970), an early one by Rupert Swyer (1971), which brings the text to the English reader, and a later one by Ian McLeod (1981), which obliges the reader to go to the text. The paper concludes by reiterating the need for Anglophone academic culture to open up to foreign perspectives, and suggests, following Goethe (Book of West and East, 1819) that new epistemes are best introduced gradually in order to avoid alienating or confusing a public that might not be ready for them. © 2017 John Benjamins Publishing Company.","Continental philosophy; English translation; French theory; Michel Foucault; Poststructuralism",,,,,,,,"(1961) Folie et Déraison.

The terms of reference of this discipline are becoming increasingly unstable as humans interface with machines, become melded with them, and ultimately become a networked entity alongside other networked entities. In this brave new world, the posthuman offers a critical perspective that allows us to liberate our thinking in new ways and points towards the possibility of a translation theory that actively engages with other disciplines as a response to disciplinary hegemony. This article looks at how technology has changed and is changing translation. It then explores the implications of transhumanism and the possibilities for a posthuman translation theory. Ultimately, the survival of translation studies will be contingent on the survival of translation itself and its ability to question its own subjective, posthuman self. © 2017 John Benjamins Publishing Company.","Biopolitics; Posthumanism; Transhumanism; Translation",,,,,,,,"Agamben, G., (1998) Homo Sacer: Sovereign Power and Bare Life, , Palto Alto, CA: Stanford University Press; (2015) The Economist, , http://www.economist.com/news/business/21642187-technology-may-not-replace-human-translators-it-will-help-them-work-better-say-what, An Say What?, 7 February 2015, Business.

Using two English translations of Adorno's seminal Ästhetische Theorie as an example, this paper elaborates an eclectic phenomenology of power structured alongside three symbolic images: the street market, the assembly line, and a technological gadget. By aligning some key concepts of critical theory with the evolutionary stages of capitalism, it will be argued that recontextualisations of Adornian thought in English may reflect the well-known antagonism between Adorno's philosophical thought and the dominant scientistic mindset of mid-20th century American social science. Ultimately, this paper contemplates the extent to which Adorno's Anglophone mirror image has been refracted through a positivist and neoliberal order of discourse that is at odds with the ideological, or utopian, convictions of German critical theory. © 2017 John Benjamins Publishing Company.","Capitalism; Critical theory; Domination; Hegemony; Ideology; Power asymmetries; Translation and philosophy",,,,,,,,"Adorno, T.W., (1970) Ästhetische Theorie, , Frankfurt: Suhrkamp; Adorno, T.W., (1984) Aesthetic Theory, , Translated by Christopher Lenhardt.

This paper investigates how reviews of translated Marxist theoretical texts, issued between 1927 and 1934 by the Communist Party of Greece, were utilised in a struggle to appropriate Marxist discourse from its rivals. Drawing on Foucault's procedures of discourse control, and calling attention to power struggles among forces with counterhegemonic ideas, the paper analyses the party's rules and conditions under which it was legitimate for a translator to carry out a translation and for the translation to enter political discourse. It will be argued that political tensions triggered changes in reviewing practices and efforts to renew translation quality criteria. These tensions shaped contemporary debates on the correct interpretation of Marxism and helped advance the party's position (a) by calling on readers to disregard earlier translations issued by political rivals; (b) by constructing its own translations as truth-objects; and by fashioning itself as the gatekeeper of Marxism. Studying translation reviews allows us to extend our understanding of the complexities of discourse formation, to trace the history of discourses, to document how knowledge can be a resource in power struggles, and to understand how power struggles can recast discursive practices. © 2017 John Benjamins Publishing Company.","Discourse control and translation; History of translation; Translation and political texts; Translation and power; Translation quality criteria; Translation reviews",,,,,,,,"Agrafiotis, P., When the slug pours out its dirty saliva (1934) Neoi Protoporoi, 7, pp. 277-278; Aguilar-Amat, A., Botsho, J., Obscured cultures: The case of sub-saharan Africa (2004) Less Translated Languages, pp. 147-164. , ed. by Albert Branchadell, and Lovell Margaret West.

So Far from the Bamboo Grove (Watkins 1986), the personal narrative of an eleven-year-old Japanese girl during the final days of WWII, was used as an educational text for primary and middle school pupils in the US until it became the target of heavy criticism from Korean-American parents who boycotted the book, arguing that it misguided young American students by constructing a 'good Japanese-bad Korean' binary. The Korean translation was distributed by a reputable publishing house in South Korea until 2007, when its distribution became controversial. Although the book - and its translation - has been the target of much criticism, it has been neglected by scholars of translation studies. Adopting the model of analysis elaborated by Baker (2006) and drawing on the concept of framing by Goffman (1974) and the work of Genette (1997), this study analyses So Far from the Bamboo Grove and its Korean translation, Yoko Iyagi (Watkins 2005, trans. Yoon), and investigates the framing strategies used by mediators to reframe the narrative in a new setting. © 2017 John Benjamins Publishing Company.","Framing; Korean; Narrative theory; Paratexts; So Far from the Bamboo Grove; Yoko Iyagi",,,,,,,,"Al-Herthani, M.M., (2009) Edward Said in Arabic: Narrativity and Paratextual Framing, , PhD diss.

The unity and divide between translation and interpreting (T&I) activities are also strongly felt in the field of training. This study adopts a data-driven approach to examine research on translator and interpreter training. Based on an annotated database of T&I journal article entries, it shows the differences and similarities in research on translator training and interpreter training. Findings suggest that research on translator training and interpreter training share a thematic and methodological framework, but have different focuses on research themes and methods. The two sub-disciplines have different active authors, institutions and country/area rankings, linked by a small yet possibly growing number of cross-sub-disciplinary producers. These findings will shed much light on our knowledge of T&I activities and research. © 2017 John Benjamins Publishing Company.","Interpreting studies; Research methods; Research themes; Training; Translation studies",,,,,,,,"Angelelli, C.V., (2013) Teaching Translation and Interpreting, pp. 5666-5670. , Chapelle 2013; Baker, M., (1998) Routledge Encyclopedia of Translation Studies, , London: Routledge; Baker, M., Saldanha, G., (2009) Routledge Encyclopedia of Translation Studies, , 2nd ed.

Drawing inspiration from Social Network Analysis (SNA), this study aims to quantify academic research impact and identify patterns of influence at an institutional level in Chinese Interpreting Studies (CIS), by seeking answers to the following questions: Which are the most influential publications? Which institutions carry the most weight? How have their respective levels of influence evolved over time? By analysing a near-exhaustive corpus of 59,303 citations from CIS literature, the study reveals that the majority of influential publications are monographs and theoretical in nature, though many Chinese textbooks on interpreting are also highly influential. It also finds that an institution's ranking in research productivity does not necessarily translate into high academic influence. © 2017 John Benjamins Publishing Company.","Chinese interpreting studies; Data science; Scientometrics; Social network analysis",,,,,,,,"Alperin, J.P., Rodia, N., Quimby, B., (2011) Community Detection and Author Disambiguation in A High Energy Physics Citation Network.

Adopting SysConc as analytical tool, the study looks at the use of personal pronouns and the image of Huineng recreated in each translation. In Wong (1930a), the use of we in combination with you presents Huineng as both friendly and authoritative; in Heng (1977b), Huineng tends to avoid personal pronouns and seems to be detached; in Cleary (1998b), Huineng is more involved in the interaction and uses many I's as well as you; in Cheng (2011), Huineng speaks in an elegant way and uses generic one as personal reference. It is argued that both the choices of personal pronouns and the images of Huineng recreated can be better understood in terms of the context of translation. © 2017 John Benjamins Publishing Company.","Context; Huineng; Interpersonal distance; Personal pronouns; Systemic functional linguistics",,,,,,,,"Bader, C.K., (2010) Fire and Brimstone (and Linguistics): The Sermon in Moby-Dick, , http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2039161:18, SSRN 2039161; Baker, M., Corpus-based translation studies: The challenges that lie ahead (1996) Terminology, LSP, and Translation: Studies in Language Engineering in Honor of Juan C.

It was deemed the ""breakthrough"" (McNeill 1975, 117) eagerly awaited by those whose stated goal was to save Canada's traditional northern culture and its stories, songs, poems and legends from being swept aside by the onslaught of southern modernity. Markoosie's text helpfully allows discussion of (post)colonial contact zones constructed in and through translational acts such as self-translation, retranslation, and relay/indirect translation as these intersect with Indigenous literature. This article explores the complex trajectory, involving various stakeholders, of the translation, circulation and reception of this important contribution to not only Inuit literature, but Canadian literature as a whole. It examines some relevant features of the author's own translation of his text into English (1970) and traces them through the two existing French translations by Claire Martin (Markoosie, tr. Martin 1971) and Catherine Ego (Markoosie, tr.

Taking stock of process-oriented research into what is called 'literal translation', transfer is defined as an instance in which a translator is primed into using a target language item that is formally similar to the source item to be translated, when alternatives are available. In order to measure the extent to which morphological transfer is present in translation, a study is conducted on translations of negative prefixes in parallel corpora of French, Swedish and Dutch. The corpus study revealed that (1) transfer is by far the main translation option translators choose in all corpora involved, (2) transfer is more frequent when translators have the opportunity to use a cognate prefix in the other language, (3) transfer is more frequent between languages belonging to the same language family. The results of the study contradict the generally acknowledged fact that transfer is more likely from a language which is culturally dominant to a language which is not. © 2016 John Benjamins Publishing Company.","Corpus-based translation studies; Morphology; Negative prefix; Transfer",,,,,,,,"Adams, V., (2001) Complex Words in English, , Harlow: Longman-Pearson; Anscombre, J.-C., L'insoutenable légèreté morphologique du préfixe indans la formation d'adjectifs (1994) LINX, 5, pp. 299-321; Anscombre, J.-C., La nuit, certains chats sont gris, ou la généricité sans syntagme générique (2002) LINX, 47, pp. 13-30; Apothéloz, D., Le rôle de l'iconicité constructionnelle dans le fonctionnement du préfixe négatif in (2003) Cahiers de Linguistique Analogique, 1, pp. 35-63; Bauer, L., (1983) English Word-Formation, , Cambridge: Cambridge University Press; Booij, G., (2002) The Morphology of Dutch, , Oxford: Oxford University Press; Branigan, H.P., Pickering, M.J., Liversedge, S.P., Stewart, A.J., Urbach, T.P., Syntactic priming: Investigating the mental representation of language (1995) Psycholinguistic Research, 24 (6), pp. 489-506; Brysbaert, M., Van Dyck, G., Van De-Poel, M., Visual word recognition in bilinguals: Evidence from masked phonological priming (1999) Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception and Performance, 25, pp. 137-148; Bybee, J., (2007) Frequency of Use and the Organization of Language, , New York: Oxford University Press; Cappelle, B., Loock, R., Is there interference of usage constraints?

In spite of its original purpose and target audience, some scholars and some guidelines maintain that AD can be useful for other sectors of the population, and suggest that sighted viewers could usefully listen to AD when 'watching' a film with blind people. In order to determine whether AD affects the sighted viewer's cognitive performance and appreciation of the film, and whether AD can be exploited as an integration tool allowing blind and sighted users to mingle when 'watching' a film, we assessed the effect of AD on sighted viewers (n = 125, 18-28 years) empirically. Results suggest that the addition of AD to films does not negatively affect the cognitive aspects of the viewing experience (i.e., general understanding and film scene recognition), nor does it dramatically affect its overall enjoyment, whereas listening to AD without the visuals poses some challenges to sighted viewers. © 2016 John Benjamins Publishing Company.","Audiovisual translation; Blind; Cognitive; Cudio description; Empirical; Evaluative; Film; Integration; Sighted",,,,,,,,"ADLAB, (2012) Report on User Needs Assessment, , http://www.adlabproject.eu/, ADLAB Project (Audio Description: Lifelong Access to the Blind); (2009) Audio Description Standards (July 2009): A Work in Progress, , http://www.acb.org/adp/, American Council of the Blind; AENOR, (2005) Norma Española UNE 153020.

The framework is then systematically applied to empirical data and a corpus-based study is conducted, using the translation of popular science articles from English into Greek as a case in point, and in particular examining any change in the frequency of passive voice reporting verbs. The discussion and corpus analysis suggest that the Code-Copying Framework offers a new vantage point for understanding translation as facilitating linguistic development in the target language, and that translation studies can benefit from adopting it as a descriptive mechanism when comparing instances of contact through translation across languages. © 2016 John Benjamins Publishing Company.","Corpus-based translation studies; English-Greek; Language change; Passive voice; Popular science; Reporting verbs",,,,,,,,"Aitchison, J., (2001) Language Change: Progress or Decay?, , 3rd ed.

Machine Translation (MT) is one of the most innovative technologies to be deployed in the field of translation, but it is still too early to predict how it can support the creativity and productivity of professional translators in the future. Currently, MT is more widely used in (non-AV) text translation than in AVT. In this article, we discuss MT technology and demonstrate why its use in AVT scenarios is particularly challenging. We also present some potentially useful methods and tools for measuring MT quality that have been developed primarily for text translation. The ultimate objective is to bridge the gap between the tech-savvy AVT community, on the one hand, and researchers and developers in the field of high-quality MT, on the other. © John Benjamins Publishing Company.","Audiovisual translation; Evaluation; Machine translation; Translation quality",,,,,,,,"Avramidis, E., Burchardt, A., Christian, F., Popovićs, M., Tscherwinka, C., Vilar, D., Involving language professionals in the evaluation of Machine translation (2012) Proceedings of LREC 2012, pp. 1127-1130. , http://www.lrec-conf.org/proceedings/lrec2012/index.html, Accessed December 12, 2015; Banerjee, S., Lavie, A., METEOR: An automatic metric for MT evaluation with improved correlation with human judgments (2005) Proceedings of the ACL Workshop on Intrinsic and Extrinsic Evaluation Measures for Machine Translation And/or Summarization, pp. 65-72. , ed. by Jade Goldstein, Alon Lavie, Chin-Yew Lin, and Clare Voss Michigan, MI: University of Michigan; Bywood, L., Volk, M., Fishel, M., Georgakopoulou, P., Parallel subtitle corpora and their applications in Machine translation and translatology (2013) Corpus Linguistics and AVT: In Search of an Integrated Approach, Special Issue of Perspectives: Studies in Translatology, 21 (4), pp. 1-16; Chaume, F., (2004) Cine y Traducción, , Madrid: Cátedra; Sousa, D., Sheila, C.M., Aziz, W., Specia, L., Assessing the post-editing effort for automatic and semi-automatic translations of DVD subtitles (2011) Proceedings of the International Conference on Recent Advances in Natural Language Processing, pp. 97-103. , http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/R11-1014.pdf, ed. by Galia Angelova, Kalina Bontcheva, Ruslan Mitkov, and Nikolai Nikolov Accessed December 22, 2015; Díaz-Cintas, J., Remael, A., (2007) Audiovisual Translation, Subtitling, , Manchester: St. Jerome; Etchegoyhen, T., Bywood, L., Fishel, M., Georgakopoulou, P., Jiang, J., Van Loenhout, G., Del Pozo, A., Volk, M., Machine translation for subtitling: A large-scale evaluation (2014) Proceedings of LREC 2014, pp. 46-53. , http://www.lrec-conf.org/proceedings/lrec2014/index.html, Accessed December 22, 2015; Lommel, A., Burchardt, A., Uszkoreit, H., Multidimensional quality metrics (MQM): A framework for declaring and describing translation quality metrics (2014) Tradumàtica: Tecnologies de la Traducció, (12), pp. 455-463; Papineni, K., Roukos, S., Ward, T., Zhu, W.-J., BLEU: A method for automatic evaluation of Machine translation (2002) Proceedings of the 40th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics, pp. 311-318. , http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1073083&picked=prox, Accessed December 22, 2015; Popović, M., Hjerson: An open source tool for automatic error classification of Machine translation output (2011) The Prague Bulletin of Mathematical Linguistics, 96, pp. 59-68; Popović, M., Morphemes and POS tags for N-gram based evaluation metrics (2011) Proceedings of the Sixth Workshop on Statistical Machine Translation, pp. 104-107. , file:///Users/SRP/Downloads/ngrams.pdf, Accessed December 22, 2015; Romero-Fresco, P., Pérez, J.M., Accuracy rate in live subtitling - The NER model (2015) Audiovisual Translation in a Global Context: Mapping an Ever-changing Landscape, pp. 28-50. , http://hdl.handle.net/10142/141892(draft), ed. by Jorge Díaz Cintas, and Rocío Baños Pinero London: Palgrave Macmillan Accessed November 4, 2015; Rubin, A.D., A theoretical taxonomy of the differences between oral and written language (1978) Center for the Study of Reading Technical Report, p. 35; Shah, K., Avramidis, E., Biçicic, E., Specia, L., QuEst - Design, implementation and extensions of a framework for Machine translation quality estimation (2013) The Prague Bulletin of Mathematical Linguistics, 100, pp. 19-30; Vilar, D., Xu, J., D'Haro, L.F., Ney, H., Error analysis of statistical Machine translation output (2006) Proceedings of LREC 2006, pp. 697-702. , file:///Users/SRP/Downloads/2lrec06_errorAnalysis.pdf, Accessed December 22, 2015",,,,"John Benjamins Publishing Company",,,,,09241884,,,,"English","Target",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84981290264

For years the focus of this analysis has been on the unbalanced representation of men and women as perceived through the use of the (sexist) grammatical and linguistic patterns of a language - for example, in literature - and the use of the images selected to portray male and female bodies - in the case of the mass media. With time, an interest in the implications that also the translation of written and audiovisual texts may have on the representation and perception of gender has grown, and attention has gradually shifted from the literary translation field to the audiovisual one. In the last decade, the study of audiovisual translation discourse from a gender perspective has ranged over a number of genres (TV series, films and commercials) and has resulted in a fruitful debate around the manifold approaches from which gender bias may be investigated, questioned and eventually reversed. In particular, De Marco (2012) has shed light on how much the consideration of audiovisual translation (AVT) as a social practice may benefit from implementing theories inherent to the multifaceted disciplines of Linguistics, Gender Studies, Film Studies and, obviously, Translation Studies. The present article discusses the extent to which such an interdisciplinary and 'engendering' approach may contribute to building a valid methodological framework within which AVT can be explored. At the same time, it highlights the limitations entailed by the difficulty of applying the same approach to the study of such a practical area - AVT - in which gender priorities are not perceived as important as other professional priorities. © John Benjamins Publishing Company.","Audiovisual translation; Gender awareness; Gender mainstreaming; Interdisciplinarity; Intersectionality",,,,,,,,"Agost, R., (1999) Traducción y Doblaje: Palabras, Voces e Imégenes, , Barcelona: Ariel; Bagilhole, B., For diversity against discrimination: From gender mainstreaming, through multiple discrimination, to intersectionality (2009) Teaching Intersectionality: Putting Gender at the Centre, pp. 45-52. , ed. by Martha Franken, Alison Woodward, Anna Cabó, and Barbara B.

Media Accessibility, particularly audio description (AD) and subtitling for the deaf and hard-of-hearing (SDH), is an example of such a 'new' mode. SDH has been evolving quickly in recent decades and new developments such as interlingual SDH and live subtitling with speech recognition bring it closer to established forms of translation and interpreting. On the one hand, interlingual SDH reintroduces Jakobson's (1959) 'translation proper' while the use of speech recognition has led to the creation of a hybrid form that has affinities with both subtitling and interpreting. Audio description, for its part, cannot even be fitted into Jakobson's 'intersemiotic translation' model since it involves translation from images into words. Research into AD is especially interesting since it rallies methods from adjacent disciplines, much in the same way that Holmes ([1972] 1988) described TS when it was a fledgling discipline. In 2008, Braun set out a research agenda for AD and the wealth of topics and research approaches dealt with in her article illustrate the immense complexity of this field and the work still to be done. Although AD and SDH research have developed at different paces and are concerned with different topics, converging trends do appear. Particularly the role of technology and the concept of multimodality seem to be key issues. This article aims to give an overview of current research trends in both these areas. It illustrates the possibilities of technologydriven research - particularly popular in SDH and live-subtitling research - while at the same time underlining the value of individual, human-driven approaches, which are still the main 'modus operandi' in the younger discipline of AD where much basic research is still required. © John Benjamins Publishing Company.","Audio description; Audiovisual translation; Media accessibility; Subtitling for the deaf and hard-of-hearing; Translation studies",,,,,,,,"Arma, S., 'Why can't you wear black shoes like the other mothers?'

IUSLIT, via Filzi 14, Trieste, 34132, Italy","This paper will explore the multimodal approach to audiovisual translation (AVT). It must first be stressed, however, that most research on multimodality has not as yet focused on questions of translation. The Routledge Handbook of Multimodal Analysis (Jewitt 2009), which contains articles by most of the leading figures in the field, while representing a major step forward in multimodal studies, does not tackle translation head on. The word 'translation' does not even appear in the index. Over a relatively short time span, most of the major contributions to the field have been more purely linguistically based and intent on providing keys to the understanding of the interplay of semiotic resources such as words, images, gesture, music, light, etc. (see O'Toole 1994; Kress and van Leeuwen 1996; Martinec 2000; Unsworth 2001; Baldry and Thibault 2006, etc.). The work of these scholars, however, has provided an impetus to developing ideas on how to exploit multimodal analyses in the area of AVT. Thibault's work, for example, on the 'multimodal transcription' provided this author with the basis for investigating how the integration of semiotic modalities in a film text could assist the subtitler in making those all-important decisions on what to retain and what to discard when faced with time constraints. Other scholars have studied the co-articulation of words and image in their discussion of how different modalities realize social functions and make meaning (O'Halloran 2008; Bednarek 2010), emphasising the importance of supplementing purely linguistic analyses with studies of all the other semiotic resources that make up a multimodal text. Findings will inevitably be reported verbally but the analyses need to explore the concept of integration and how other resources can interact with language and, crucially, how translators can be made sensitive to the entire semiotic impact of a multimodal text. © John Benjamins Publishing Company.","Access; Audiovisual translation; Modes; Multimodal texts; Multimodal transcription",,,,,,,,"Baldry, A., (2000) Multimodality and Multimediality in the Distance Learning Age, , Campobasso: Palladino Editore; Baldry, A., Subtitling dynamic multimodal texts: The development of interactive self-access tools (2002) The Economy Principle in English: Linguistic, Literary and Cultural Perspectives, pp. 54-62. , ed. by Giovanni Iamartino, Maria L.

This is an area where scholarly research is inevitably playing catch-up with rapid change both in the language industries and in film and television production. For example, we have a general sense of 'dubbing territories' and 'subtitling territories' but in reality the picture is more complex. Norms changed in the course of the home entertainment revolution, with the arrival of the DVD format in the late 1990s ostensibly increasing viewer choice and flexibility of translation provision. The relocation of much audiovisual material to an online environment has also generated fundamental changes in the way that works circulate, with volunteer translators and automated translation processes playing a larger role. Policy developments in access translation have meant that there have also been great changes relatively recently in the availability of SDH subtitling, audio description and other modes of access translation. This is a very broad field which raises many compelling research questions. At the same time, its very breadth does not lend itself to a comprehensive overview. The article will therefore aim to provide an orientation to, rather than a summary of, the theoretical and methodological challenges of research on this topic. © John Benjamins Publishing Company.","Audiovisual translation; Dubbing; Norms; Subtitling; Translation policy",,,,,,,,"Agost, R., Translation in bilingual contexts: Different norms in dubbing translation (2004) Topics in Audiovisual Translation, pp. 63-82. , ed. by Pilar Orero Amsterdam: John Benjamins; Alfaro De Carvalho, C., Quality standards or censorship?

This inevitably broaches questions of linguistic and cultural representation, critical in a world in which the global availability of cultural products is ever greater. They are a main focus in this paper, with related questions about the development of subtitling and dubbing language as idiosyncratic varieties and expressive media, and implications for representation and its impact on audiences. AVT research has had many challenges to confront in its early days and these are relatively uncharted territories. Ye t current developments like fansubbing and other crowdsourcing activities are re-defining the name of the game and heralding significant changes, in AVT practices and in the ways they and the products and responses they generate are accounted for in research (as evidenced in emerging re-evaluations of quality and subjectivity, e.g.; see Pérez-González 2012, 2014). These are central concerns in mapping the way forward. © John Benjamins Publishing Company.","Audiovisual translation; Cross-cultural pragmatics; Linguistic/cultural representation; Pragmatic situatedness",,,,,,,,"Antonini, R., Chiaro, D., The perception of dubbing by Italian audiences (2009) Audiovisual Translation: Language Transfer on Screen, pp. 97-113. , ed. by Díaz Cintas Jorge, and Gunilla Anderman Basingstoke: Palgrave Macmillan; Bannon, D., (2009) The Elements of Subtitles: A Practical Guide to the Art of Dialogue, Character, Context, Tone and Style in Film and Television Subtitling, , Blackstock: Translation Studies Press; Baños, R., Bruti, S., Zanotti, S., Corpus linguistics and audiovisual translation: In search of an integrated approach (2013) Special Issue of Perspectives: Studies in Translatology, 21 (4); Bonsignori, V., Bruti, S., Masi, S., Formulae across languages: English greetings, leave-takings and good wishes in dubbed Italian (2011) Audiovisual Translation in Close-up: Practical and Theoretical Approaches, pp. 23-44. , ed. by Adriana Şerban, Anna Matamala, and Jean-Marc Lavaur Bern: Peter Lang; Brown, P., Levinson, S.C., (1987) Politeness, , Cambridge: Cambridge University Press; Bruti, S., The translation of compliments in subtitles (2009) New Trends in Audiovisual Translation, pp. 226-238. , ed. by Jorge Díaz Cintas Clevedon: Multilingual Matters; Bruti, S., Translating compliments and insults in the pavia corpus of film dialogues: Two sides of the same coin?

Given the disjunctions between the ontological levels (and analytical levels of specificity) implied in these concepts (cognitive, linguistic and socio-cultural), the paper first sets out an argument for how these ontologies are related, demonstrating how cognitive processing, and specifically cognitive effort for both translators and readers, form a second-level constituent of both these sets of concepts, by drawing on usage-based theories of language. From within this conceptual frame, the paper turns its attention to an empirical investigation. The study demonstrates how a combination of product and process methods may be utilised to explore the cognitive effort involved in domesticating and foreignising choices. The findings of the study are used to formulate some suggestions regarding how investigations of cognitive effort in translation may contribute to an understanding of fluency/resistancy and domestication/foreignisation in diverse contexts. © John Benjamins Publishing Company.","Cognitive approaches; Domestication; Empirical; Eye-tracking; Foreignisation; Keystroke logging; Process-oriented methodologies; Quantitative; Theoretical",,,,,,,,"Angelone, E., (2010) Uncertainty, Uncertainty Management and Metacognitive Problem Solving in the Translation Task, pp. 17-40. , Shreve and Angelone 2010; Bernardini, S., Think-aloud protocols in translation research: Achievements, limits, future prospects (2001) Target, 13 (2), pp. 241-263; Bybee, J., (2006) Frequency of use and the Organisation of Language, , Oxford: Oxford University Press; Bybee, J., (2010) Language, Usage and Cognition, , Cambridge: Cambridge University Press; Campbell, S., Choice network analysis in translation research (2000) Intercultural Faultlines: Research Models in Translation Studies i - Textual and Cognitive Aspects, pp. 29-42. , ed. by Maeve Olohan Manchester: St. Jerome; Chesterman, A., Wagner, E., (2002) Can Theory Help Translators?

Translation scholars would also seem to be particularly mobile (71 percent have spent more than one year in a country other than their own) and come from diverse academic and professional backgrounds (33 percent were not engaged in translation and interpreting in their mid-twenties). These figures indicate that translation scholars not only have considerable practical experience of translation but also come from a wide range of occupational and cultural backgrounds. Asked about desirable relations between scholarly work and professional practice, respondents indicated benefits for both sides (although a slight majority stressed a unidirectional relationship where scholarly work benefits from professional practice), and teaching is often indicated as the link between the two. However, about a quarter of the scholars indicated that there need not be a relationship between scholarship and professional practice. © John Benjamins Publishing Company.","Research-industry relations; Sociology of research; Translation profession; Translation scholars",,,,,,,,"Brown, S., (2002) Do Interpreters Translate?

Built as an extension of the English<>Italian subsection of EPIC (the European Parliament Interpreting Corpus), EPTIC is an intermodal corpus featuring the pseudo-parallel outputs of interpreting and translation processes, aligned to each other and to the corresponding source texts (speeches by MEPs and their written up versions). As a first attempt at unearthing the potential of EPTIC, we investigate lexical simplification replicating the methodology proposed by Laviosa (1998a; 1998b), but extending it to encompass both a monolingual comparable and an intermodal perspective. Our results indicate that the mediation process reduces complexity in both modes of language production and both language directions, with interpreters simplifying the input more than translators, and evidence of simplification being more lexical in English and more lexico-syntactic in Italian. © John Benjamins Publishing Company.","Corpus-based approach; English; Intermodal corpora; Interpreting; Italian; Lexical simplification; Translation",,,,,,,,"Baker, M., Corpus linguistics and translation studies: Implications and applications (1993) Text and Technology: In Honour of John Sinclair, pp. 233-250. , ed. by Mona Baker, Gill Francis, and Elena Tognini-Bonelli Amsterdam: John Benjamins; Baroni, M., Bernardini, S., Ferraresi, A., Zanchetta, E., The WaCky wide web: A collection of very large linguistically processed web-crawled corpora (2009) Language Resources and Evaluation, 43 (3), pp. 209-226; Bendazzoli, C., (2010) Corpora e Interpretazione Simultanea, , Bologna: Asterisco; Gile, D., (2004) Translation Research Versus Interpreting Research: Kinship, Differences and Prospects for Partnership, pp. 10-34. , Schäffner 2004; Halliday, M.A.K., Mathiessen, C., (2004) An Introduction to Functional Grammar, , London: Arnold; Kajzer-Wietrzny, M., (2012) Interpreting Universals and Interpreting Style, , PhD diss.

Based on the publisher's archival materials, this paper uncovers the roles of and relationships between the English translator, Latin translator, publisher, printer and copyeditor for the use of Latin in Clement Egerton's 1939 English translation The Golden Lotus of the classic Chinese novel Jin Ping Mei. I argue that pre-publication censorship was influenced by sophisticated hierarchical and horizontal networks of agents. The Latin passages in The Golden Lotus, which have always been attributed to Egerton, are revealed by the archives to be the work of an unknown Latin scholar. The use of Latin in The Golden Lotus is both reflective of the social context of the 1930s and representative of the complexity of the agential network in translation. © John Benjamins Publishing Company.","Agent; Censorship; English translation; Jin Ping Mei; Latin; Network; The Golden Lotus",,,,,,,,"Abdallah, K., Koskinen, K., Managing trust: Translating and the network economy (2007) Meta, 52 (4), pp. 673-687; Bassnett, S., Lefevere, A., (1990) Translation, History, and Culture, , London: Pinter Publishers; Billiani, F., (2006) Modes of Censorship and Translation: National Contexts and Diverse Media, , Manchester: St. Jerome; Boyer, P.S., (1968) Purity in Print: The Vice-society Movement and Book Censorship in America, , New York: Scribner; Buzelin, H., Unexpected allies: How latour's network theory could complement bourdieusian analyses in translation studies (2005) The Translator, 11 (2), pp. 193-218; Buzelin, H., (2007) Translation 'in the Making', pp. 135-170. , Wolf and Fukari 2007; Buzelin, H., Folaron, D., (2007) La Traduction et les Études de Réseaux / Translation and Network Studies, 52 (4). , special issue of Meta; Buzelin, H., Agents of translation (2010) Handbook of Translation Studies, 1, pp. 6-12. , ed. by Yves Gambier, and Luc van Doorslaer Amsterdam: John Benjamins; Chang, K.-I.S., Owen, S., (2010) The Cambridge History of Chinese Literature, , 2 vols.

Some significant correlations were found between trait EI and the variables of job satisfaction, career success, and literary translation experience. This is the first study to examine the effect of EI on translator working practices. Findings illustrate that trait EI may be predictive of some aspects of translator behaviour and highlight the relevance of exploring the emotional intelligence of professional translators. © John Benjamins Publishing Company.","Career success; Job satisfaction; Literary translation; Professional translators; Trait emotional intelligence",,,,,,,,"Abdolrezapour, P., The relationship between emotional intelligence and EFL learners' writing performance (2013) Procedia - Social and Behavioural Sciences, 70, pp. 331-339; Abdolrezapour, P., Tavakoli, M., The relationship between emotional intelligence and EFL learners' achievement in reading comprehension (2012) Innovation in Language Learning and Teaching, 6, pp. 1-13; Ahmetoglu, G., Leutner, F., Chamorro-Premuzic, T., EQ-nomics: Understanding the relationship between individual differences in trait emotional intelligence and entrepreneurship (2011) Personality and Individual Differences, 51, pp. 1028-1033; Amabile, T.M., Barsade, S.G., Mueller, J.S., Staw, B.M., Affect and creativity at work (2005) Administrative Science Quarterly, 50, pp. 367-403; Anderson, J., The double agent: Aspects of literary translator affect as revealed in fictional work by translators (2005) Linguistica Antverpiensia, 4, pp. 171-182; Austin, E.J., Dore, T.C.P., O'Donovan, K.K., Associations of personality and emotional intelligence with display rule perceptions and emotional labour (2008) Personality and Individual Differences, 44, pp. 679-688; Batista, C., (2003) Bréviaire d'un Traducteur, , Paris: Arléa; Bayer-Hohenwarter, G., Creative shifts as a means of measuring and promoting translational creativity (2011) Meta: Translators' Journal, 56, pp. 663-692; Bereiter, C., Scardamalia, M., (1987) The Psychology of Written Composition, , Hillsdale, NJ: Erlbaum; Bhullar, N., Schutte, N.S., Malouff, J.M., The nature of well-being: The roles of hedonic and eudaimonic processes and trait emotional intelligence (2013) The Journal of Psychology: Interdisciplinary and Applied, 147, pp. 1-16; Bontempo, K., Malcolm, K., An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure: Educating interpreters about the risk of vicarious trauma in healthcare settings (2012) Our Hands: Educating Healthcare Interpreters, pp. 105-130. , ed. by Karen Malcolm, and Laurie Swabey Washington DC: Gallaudet University Press; Chell, E., (2008) The Entrepreneurial Personality: A Social Construction, , New York: Routledge; Chell, E., Baines, S., Networking, entrepreneurship and microbusiness behaviour (2000) Entrepreneurship & Regional Development: An International Journal, 12, pp. 195-215; Cherniss, C., Emotional intelligence: Toward clarification of a concept (2010) Industrial and Organizational Psychology, 3, pp. 110-126; Davis, S.K., Humphrey, N., Emotional intelligence predicts adolescent mental health beyond personality and cognitive ability (2012) Personality and Individual Differences, 52, pp. 144-149; Dawda, D., Hart, S.D., Assessing emotional intelligence: Reliability and validity of the bar-on emotional quotient inventory (EQ-i) in university students (2000) Personality and Individual Differences, 28, pp. 797-812; Dewaele, J.-M., McCloskey, J., Attitudes towards foreign accents among adult multilingual language users (2015) Journal of Multilingual and Multicultural Development, 36 (3), pp. 221-238; Di Fabio, A., Saklofske, D.H., Promoting individual resources: The challenge of trait emotional intelligence (2014) Personality and Individual Differences, 65, pp. 19-23; Domino, G., Domino, M.L., (2006) Psychological Testing: An Introduction, , New York: Cambridge University Press; Downey, L.A., Johnston, P.J., Hansen, K., Schembri, R., Stough, C., Tuckwell, V., Schweitzer, I., The relationship between emotional intelligence and depression in a clinical sample (2008) European Journal of Psychiatry, 22, pp. 93-98; Durastanti, S., (2002) Éloge de la Trahison: Notes du Traducteur, , Paris: Le Passage; Durlak, J.A., Weissberg, R.P., Dymnicki, A.B., Taylor, R.D., Schellinger, K.B., The impact of enhancing students' social and emotional learning: A meta-analysis of school-based universal interventions (2011) Child Development, 82, pp. 405-432; Feist, G.J., A meta-analysis of personality in scientific and artistic creativity (1998) Personality and Social Psychology Review, 2, pp. 290-309; Ferrando, M., Prieto, M.D., Almeida, L.S., Ferrándiz, C., Bermejo, R., López-Pina, J.A., Hernández, D., Fernández, M.-C., Trait emotional intelligence and academic performance.

Drawing upon the insights of systemic functional linguistics (SFL) and critical discourse analysis (CDA), this study explores how language is used by different governmental institutions in shaping their social power and hierarchy. By conducting a comparative study of the SARS notices and their translations, focusing on speech roles, speech functions, modality types and modality orientation, the authors argue that choices made in producing the texts reflect the institutions' social roles and their relationship with each other and with the audience. They also argue that the application of concepts from SFL in detailed text analysis and from CDA in the overall discussion may better reveal how different models of discourse analysis can supplement each other and be applied to translation studies.","Discourse analysis; Language; Power; Translation studies",,,,,,,,"Chouliaraki, L., Fairclough, N., (1999) Discourse in Late Modernity: Rethinking Critical Discourse Analysis, , Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press; Fairclough, N., (1989) Language and Power, , London: Longman; Fairclough, N., (1992) Discourse and Social Change, , Cambridge: Polity Press; Fairclough, N., Wodak, R., Critical discourse analysis (1997) Discourse as Social Interaction, pp. 258-284. , ed. by Teun A.

One of the topics in discourse analysis that has been given particular attention by translation scholars is the translation of choices within the textual metafunction, with particular focus on the role of Theme and its impact on thematic development in text. A number of studies have generated new insights into the translation of textual choices, for example concerning failures to recreate patterns of thematic progression. The growth of this area of research is a highly encouraging development since it had previously been largely neglected in translation studies (House 1997, 31). While these studies have focused on separate micro-issues in specific language pairs, the present article attempts to conduct a comprehensive review of existing studies on this topic in order to (i) highlight major topics addressed so far and (ii) make suggestions for further studies into this important area of translation from a systemic functional linguistic perspective.","Textual meaning; Thematic progression; Theme; Translation choices",,,,,,,,"Baker, M., (2011) Other Words, , 1992, London: Routledge; Baker, M., Corpus linguistics and translation studies: Implications and applications (1993) Text and Technology, pp. 233-250. , Honour of John Sinclair, ed. by Mona Baker, Gill Francis, and Elena Tognini-Bonelli, Amsterdam: John Benjamins; Caffarel, A., Martin, J.R., Matthiessen, C.M.I.M., (2004) Language Typology: A Functional Perspective, , eds.

This claim will be followed by three generalizing assumptions about contrastive differences in English-German cohesion which relate to (1) different degrees of local encoding of ambiguity in texts in terms of co-reference, (2) different degrees of registerial distinctions along the written-spoken and formal-informal distinctions, and (3) different orientations of discourses along the explicitness and information-density dimensions. These assumptions are being tested in corpus-based work in our group, and the currently available results will be summarized. The summary will be followed by a discussion and exemplification of implications for translation in both directions between English and German. As will be seen, an awareness of the main differences between English and German cohesion, between registers within these two languages and between written and spoken modes in particular are an important background for guiding translation strategies.","Contrastive cohesion english-German; Corpus-based translation studies; Registers in translation",,,,,,,,"Alves, F., Pagano, A., Neumann, S., Steiner, E., Hansen-Schirra, S., Translation units and grammatical shifts: Towards an integration of product- And process-based translation research (2010) Translation and Cognition, pp. 109-141. , ed. by Gregory M.

Concretely, the paper examines how global English impacts on translations from English into German with regard to so-called 'linking constructions,' a hitherto rather neglected area of connectivity in discourse. The analysis focusses on the forms, functions, distribution, and the translation equivalents in parallel and comparable corpora. Results indicate that the use of linking constructions differs substantially in English and German discourse, and these differences may well block English influence on German discourse norms via translation.","Contrastive pragmatics; Diachronic corpus study; English-German contrastive discourse analysis; Global english; Impact of english on German discourse norms; Linking constructions; Parallel and comparative corpora",,,,,,,,"Aijmer, K., Themes and tails: The discourse functions of dislocated elements (1994) Nordic Journal of Linguistics, 12, pp. 137-154; Bateson, G., (1972) Steps to An Ecology of Mind, , Chicago: Chicago University Press; Baumgarten, N., Probst, J., The interaction of spokenness and writtenness in audience design (2004) Multilingual Communication, pp. 63-86. , ed. by Juliane House and Jochen Rehbein, Amsterdam: John Benjamins; Becher, V., (2011) Explicitation and Implicitation in Translation.

Focusing on a controversy over the Korean translation of Walter Isaacson's 2011 biography of Steve Jobs, it examines how readers participating in a translation debate in Daum Agora, the largest online discussion forum in South Korea, enact the 'assessor' role in evaluating the translation. Drawing on the concepts of 'social role,' 'activity role,' and 'discourse role,' I argue that online translation assessors perform the discourse roles of 'expert-judge,' 'activist,' and 'assessment evaluator.' The findings suggest that translation assessment in cyberspace is a subjective, contextualizing process where value, meaning, and function are often a matter of uptake. Furthermore, discourse-based approaches may play critical roles in examining translation assessment in cyberspace as a socially situated act that involves an intricate negotiation of meaning, complex workings of power, and a reconstitution of local social positioning within global cultural flows.","Digital media technology; Social activism; Translation assessment; Translation quality; Translation reception",,,,,,,,"Ahn, J.-H., (2011) Suthipu Capsu Penyekca Ancinhwanipnita [[I'm] Jin-Hwan Ahn, the Translator of Steve Jobs], , http://cafe.naver.com/minumsa/18956, Minumsa.

The article illustrates that methods of (critical) discourse analysis can be used to identify positioning strategies which are employed by participants in such triadic exchanges.

It starts with a short overview of news translation as a subfield within the discipline of translation studies, emphasizing the role of translation in news production since the emergence of the journalistic profession. The next section discusses the concepts of 'stable' and 'unstable' sources, and moves on to introduce framing, a key concept in communication studies, defined as the central organizing idea that allows news consumers to make sense of events. The term will be related to the mechanisms that journalists resort to in order to produce source texts, which, in turn, can also affect the selection and de-selection processes undertaken by news producers when relying on articles published in other languages. The final sections will consider the translated economic columns of Paul Krugman, originally published in the New York Times and in Spanish by the daily El País, to reflect on the usefulness of the binary opposition stable versus unstable sources, and will show that, in some media, certain unstable texts can turn stable.","Framing; News translation; Stable and unstable sources",,,,,,,,"Baker, M., (2006) Translation and Conflict, , London: Routledge; Baumann, G., Gillespie, M., Sreberny, A., Transcultural journalism and the politics of translation: Interrogating the BBC world service (2011) Journalism, 12 (2), pp. 135-142; Baumann, G., Gillespie, M., Sreberny, A., Transcultural journalism: Translations, transmissions and transformations (2011) Journalism, 12 (2), pp. 235-238; Bielsa, E., Bassnett, S., (2009) Translation in Global News, , London: Routledge; Borah, P., Conceptual issues in framing theory: A systematic examination of a decade's literature (2011) Journal of Communication, 61 (2), pp. 246-263; Castells, M., (2009) Communication Power, , Oxford: Oxford University Press; Conway, K., Paradoxes of translation in television news (2010) Media, Culture & Society, 32 (6), pp. 979-996; Conway, K., Bassnett, S., (2006) Translation in Global News, , eds.

Particular emphasis is placed on memory and performance in oral narratives, two aspects of interviews that seem underrepresented in existing translation studies literature, and some attention is paid to how existing translation studies research could benefit oral history. © John Benjamins Publishing Company.","Interview methodology; Memory; Narrative performance; Oral history; Translation history",,,,,,,,"Andrews, M., A Monoglot Abroad: Working Through the Problems of Translation (1995) Oral History, 23 (2), pp. 47-50; Asadi, P., Séguinot, C., Shortcuts, Strategies and General Patterns in a Process Study of Nine Professionals (2005) Meta, 50 (2), pp. 522-547; Baker, M., Narratives in and of Translation (2005) SKASE Journal of Translation and Interpretation, 1 (1), pp. 4-13; Baker, M., (2006) Translation and Conflict: A Narrative Account, , London: Routledge; Baker, M., Translation and Activism: Emerging Patterns of Narrative Community (2006) The Massachusetts Review, 47 (3), pp. 462-484; Bauman, R., (1986) Story, Performance, and Event: Contextual Studies of Oral Narrative, , Cambridge: Cambridge University Press; Ben-Ari, N., Popular Mass Production in the Periphery: Socio-political Tendencies in Subversive Translation (2008) Beyond Descriptive Translation Studies: Investigations in Homage to Gideon Toury, pp. 1-18. , ed. by Anthony Pym, Miriam Shlesinger, and Daniel Simeoni Amsterdam: John Benjamins; Boéri, J., Maier, C., (2010) Translation/Interpreting and Social Activism, , Manchester: St. Jerome; Borland, K., 'That's Not What I Said': Interpretive Conflict in Oral Narrative Research (2006) The Oral History Reader. 2nd Ed, pp. 310-321. , ed. by Robert Perks and Alistair Thompson London: Routledge; Buzelin, H., Translations 'in the Making.'

Traducción e Interpretación, Facultad de Letras, Campus de la Merced, Santo Cristo s/n, Murcia, 30001, Spain","Typological studies on the linguistic expression of motion are certainly of interest to translation scholars. The study of how motion is expressed across languages has indeed revealed some striking typological differences (e.g., Talmy 1985, 1991, 2000; Berman and Slobin 1994; Stromqvist and Verhoeven 2004), which can account for some of the strategies translators resort to when dealing with motion expressions (Slobin 1996; Ibarretxe-Antuñano 2003; Cifuentes-Férez 2006, 2013; Ibarretxe-Antuñano and Filipović 2013). However, the question still remains as to whether translators' decisions are exclusively guided by such typological differences or whether there are other experience- or task-related factors that may explain their behaviour. This paper provides empirical evidence on the type of factors that guide translators' decisions when translating manner-ofmotion verbs, exploring the impact of different types of texts and the translator's level of expertise. For this purpose, a pilot think-aloud protocol is implemented in order to examine the translation process of ten Spanish translators (five professionals and five graduate students without professional experience) when transferring manner-of-motion verbs from English into Spanish. Our results reveal that the way translators deal with manner information is mainly influenced by typological differences between the two languages. But differences in the translators' level of professional expertise and in task-related constraints (e.g., the degree in which different type of texts focus on motion verbs) also have an effect on the strategies that translators choose to convey manner information. © John Benjamins Publishing Company.","English; Manner of motion; Spanish; Think-aloud protocol; Thinking-for-speaking; Translation",,,,,,,,"Aske, J., Path Predicates in English and Spanish: A Closer Look (1989) Proceedings of the Berkeley Linguistics Society, 15, pp. 1-14; Aurnague, M., How Motion Verbs are Spatial: The Spatial Foundations of Intransitive Motion Verbs in French (2011) Lingvisticae Investigationes, 34 (1), pp. 1-34; Beavers, J., Levin, B., Tham, S.W., The Typology of Motion Expressions Revisited (2010) Journal of Linguistics, 46, pp. 331-377; Berman, R., Slobin, D.I., (1994) Relating Events in Narrative: A Crosslinguistic Developmental Study, , eds.

This paper argues that a translator's professional habitus is highly influenced by the adjacent discipline. With Edgar Snow as an illustrative case, it attempts to explore the influence of journalism on the structuring of Snow's professional habitus as a translator. An analysis of Snow's social trajectory and inculcation of journalistic habitus and his translation strategies as a journalist translator, especially those of deletion of 'telling,' addition of 'showing,' and changing of beginning and ending, demonstrates that Snow's professional habitus as a translator is obviously affected by his profession as a journalist. The translator's habitus is a locus revealing a visible embodiment of interdisciplinary influences, and his/her professional habitus is a combination of dispositions of both the profession of translation and the profession of the adjacent discipline. © John Benjamins Publishing Company.","Adjacent discipline; Edgar Snow; Journalist translator; Professional habitus",,,,,,,,"Bourdieu, P., (1977) Outline of A Theory of Practice, , Cambridge: Cambridge University Press; Bourdieu, P., Wacquant, L.J.D., (1992) An Invitation to Reflexive Sociology, , Chicago: The University of Chicago Press; Bourdieu, P., (1993) The Field of Cultural Production: Essays on Art and Literature, , Cambridge: Polity Press; Bourdieu, P., (2000) Pascalian Meditations, , Cambridge: Polity Press; Bourdieu, P., Habitus (2005) Habitus: A Sense of Place, pp. 43-49. , ed. by Jean Hiller and Emma Rooksby, Aldershot: Ashgate; Chatman, S., (1978) Story and Discourse: Narrative Structure in Fiction and Film, , Ithaca: Cornell University Press; Farnsworth, R.M., (1996) From Vagabond to Journalist: Edgar Snow in Asia 1928-1941, , Missouri: University of Missouri Press; Ge, F., 'Baizi' and Suppositional Narration (2005) Journal of Tsinghua University (Philosophy and Social Science), 20 (1), pp. 20-27 and 34; Gouanvic, J.-M., A Bourdieusian Theory of Translation, or the Coincidence of Practical Instances: Field, 'Habitus,' Capital and 'Illusio' (2005) The Translator, 11 (2), pp. 147-166; Hampton, M., Rethinking the 'New Journalism,' 1850s-1930s (2004) Journal of British Studies, 43 (2), pp. 278-290; Hough, G.A., 3rd, (1988) News Writing. 4th Ed., , Boston: Houghton Mifflin Company; Inghilleri, M., Habitus, Field and Discourse (2003) Target, 15 (2), pp. 243-268; Inghilleri, M., The Sociology of Bourdieu and the Construction of the 'Object' in Translation and Interpreting Studies (2005) The Translator, 11 (2), pp. 125-145; Jespersen, T.C., (1991) The American Century in China: Henry Luce, United China Relief, and the Creation of American Perceptions of China, 1931-1949, , Unpublished PhD diss.

The legacy of former and unofficial designations such as 'Serbo-Croatian' or 'Bosnian-Croatian-Serbian' within the post-conflict situation is contextualised and translators' decision-making processes and reported strategies in relation to language form and designation are examined. The paper seeks to demonstrate the explanatory power of Toury's notion of norms as a framework to account for new regularities of practice. Texts identified to be different from their nominal code, or market requests to work from or into unofficial designations are now problematised and re-negotiated as secondary practices or a less commonly reported behaviour. The paper extends and applies the notion of norms to the social and occupational, macro-pragmatic role that translators occupy. © John Benjamins Publishing Company.","Bosnian; Croatian; Language designations; Norms; Post-conflict situations; Serbian; Translator roles",,,,,,,,"Apter, E., Balkan Babel: Translation Zones, Military Zones (2001) Public Culture, 13 (1), pp. 65-80; Askew, L., Salama-Carr, M., Interview: Interpreters in Conflict - The View from Within (2011) Translation Studies, 4 (1), pp. 103-108; Baibikov, E., Revised Translations, Revised Identities (Auto)biographical Contextualization of Translation (2010) Translation and Interpreting Studies, 5 (1), pp. 59-74; Brborić, B., Das Serbische (1999) Handbuch der Südosteuropa-Linguistik, pp. 339-382. , ed. by Uwe Hinrichs, Wiesbaden: Harrassowitz Verlag; Brozović, D., (1969) Rječnik Jezika Ili Jezik Rječnika?

How does the intersubjectively constituted voice of the translator manifest itself in paratexts, in the translated text and, in the case of singer-translators, in the translator's physical, performing voice? The case discussed is that of Bob Dylan in (re)translation into Norwegian, and it is concluded that different singer-translators involve others in the process in various ways and to varying degrees; that there are great subjective differences in how and to what extent they take other (re)translations of Dylan into account; and that they choose different strategies for displaying their voices in paratexts, texts and performances, differences that can be explained by reference to the singer-translator's role and status on the cultural scene. © John Benjamins Publishing Company.","Authenticity; Bakhtin; Bob dylan; Manifest voice; Non-manifest voice; Popular music; Retranslation; Song translation; Trønder dialect; Voice",,,,,,,,"Aadland, T.R., Blod på spora [Blood on the tracks] (2009) Embacle EMB, p. 1. , compact disc, 147759; Aleksandersen, (1997) Åge with His Band and Taraf de Haidouks., , Fredløs.

The three decades between the translations are marked by important social, political and cultural changes in both source and target language communities: from the 1960s turmoil with respect to Québec's aspirations for independence to a certain political fatigue in both groups in the 2000s, from a focus within Québec letters on a national agenda to other aesthetic and cultural concerns, and from a colonial to a postcolonial editorial context in both Anglophone and Francophone literatures in Canada. What may appear as target culture recuperative strategies in the editorial and translatorial positioning of a retranslation may correspond on closer analysis to parallel changes in the source culture reception of the book. © John Benjamins Publishing Company.","Anglophone; Aquin; Canada; Colonial; Extra-textual voice; Francophone; Intra-textual voice; Postcolonial; Québec; Retranslation",,,,,,,,"Aquin, H., Prochain épisode (1965) Montréal: Le Cercle du Livre Français; Aquin, H., (1966) Prochain Épisode, , Paris: Laffont; Aquin, H., (1967) Prochain Episode, , Translated by Penny Williams.

Voice is understood here as the set of textual cues characterizing a subjective or collective identity in a text. The author focuses on what is special about voice in retranslation and how intratextual (a character's voice) and extratextual voices (translators' and publishers' voices) might be related in retranslation. The analysis indicates that a character's voice as a whole can reflect the retranslator's voice and the purpose of his/her translation. In addition, translators' voices can recirculate in retranslation, but they do not necessarily do so if the purpose of the translation, the translator's choice of source texts, or translation ethics prevents this. © John Benjamins Publishing Company.","Character's voice; Extratextual voice; Finnish translation history; Friday; Indirect translation; Intratextual voice; Retranslation; Robinson Crusoe; Translator'svoice",,,,,,,,"Campe, J.H., (1779) Robinson der Jüngere, 2. , Hamburg: Carl Ernst Bohn; Defoe, D., (1719) Robinson Crusoe, , Edited by Michael Shinagel.

In this article we argue that the figure of the first translator exerts an influence in the retranslation process, and all retranslators are forced to develop a stance towards the predecessor. Taking Harold Bloom's notion of anxiety of influence in poetry as a starting point, we look at two cases of retranslation that share the same famous first translator, Pentti Saarikoski, analysing how and where the voice of this first translation can be heard in the retranslations. According to Bloom's taxonomy, there are six modes available to poets. Applying the same taxonomy to our two retranslators, we find that they have resorted to different modes. What remains constant is that the figure of the first translator is an unavoidable function of the retranslation process and needs to be taken into account both by the retranslator and by researchers studying retranslations. © John Benjamins Publishing Company.","Anxiety of influence; Dependency; First translator; Pentti Saarikoski; Retranslator; Translator roles",,,,,,,,"Heikura, P., Aristoteleen kantapää.""

Hammett subversively introduced these terms in a resolvably ambiguous fashion, relying on readers to trigger underlying homosexual interpretations. Instances of queer and fairy were attenuated in early versions (1933, 1946) but in more recent versions (1968, 1974, 1992, and 2011) were generally preserved (marica) or even intensified (maricón). In many cases, the Spanish translators misinterpreted the gooseberry lay, which has no sexual connotations at all, thinking it meant something homosexual. In all cases, the term gunsel, which does have a homosexual meaning, was stripped of all male same-sex significance and was cast into slang terms for gunman, thug or killer.","Ambiguity; Hard-boiled novel; Homosexuality; Literature; Sex-related language; Slang; Translation",,,,,,,,"Alonso Tejada, L., (1977) La Represión Sexual en la España de Franco, , Barcelona: Luis de Caralt; Alvstad, C., Ambiguity translated for children: Andersen's 'den standhaftige tinsoldat' as a case in point (2008) Target, 20 (2), pp. 222-248; Ayto, J., (2000) Bloomsbury Dictionary of Euphemisms, , London: Bloomsbury; Barzun, J., Taylor, W.H., (1971) A Catalogue of Crime, , New York: Harper and Row; Berrey, L.V., Van Den Bark, M., (1952) The American Thesaurus of Slang, , [1942]. 2nd ed.

As referential cohesion is hypothesized to be affected by certain universals of translation, the explicitation and the repetition avoidance hypotheses are also tested. Analyses show considerable shifts of reference in translations, but these are not statistically significant. The corpus also fails to provide evidence for the universals of translation investigated; however, the in-depth analysis of optional shifts suggests that they are conditioned by the discursive features of the genre and contribute to a more explicit presentation of news content.","Event structure; Explicitation; News translation; Referential cohesion; Repetition avoidance; Shift of cohesion; Universal of translation",,,,,,"Hungarian Scientific Research Fund, OTKA: OTKA K83243","2..

Arguing that Safak's habitus has a considerable influence on her style in Baba ve Piç, the paper focuses on Safak's incorporation of Ottoman Turkish words into the Turkish translation in order to show that the addition of these words frames the Turkish translation within the broader narrative of language planning in Turkey. Ultimately, the study argues that the concept of habitus and the concept of narrative can be fruitfully brought together to explain how certain socio-stylistic aspects of the habitus-governed translation respond to the larger narratives of the target society.","Habitus; Language planning; Narrative theory; Style; Translation",,,,,,,,"Adil, A., (2004) Bugged by the Past amid Istanbul's Flights of Fancy, , http://www.armeniandiaspora.com/showthread.php?5650-Books-Bugged-by-the-past-amid-Istanbul-s-flights-offancy, Accessed December 2010; Ahmad, F., (1993) The Making of Modern Turkey, , New York: Routledge; Akalin, H., The endless debate Q, X, W (2002) Türk Dili Dergisi, 601 (1), pp. 6-13. , The Turkish Language Journal; Akbatur, A., (2010) Writing/Translating In/to English: The 'Ambivalent' Case of Elif ŞAfak, , PhD diss.

In this paper, we focus on the notion of explicitation through a multifaceted study of causal connectives, integrating four different variables: The role of the source and the target languages, the influence of specific connectives and the role of the discourse relation they convey. Our results indicate that while source and target languages do not globally influence explicitation, specific connectives have a significant impact on this phenomenon. We also show that in English and French, the most frequently used connectives for explicitation share a similar semantic profile. Finally, we demonstrate that explicitation also varies across different discourse relations, even when they are conveyed by a single connective.","Causality; Corpus-based translation studies; Discourse connectives; Explicitation; Translation universals",,,,,,"Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur FÃ¶rderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung, SNSF

In rough chronological order, separate institutions have been created for literary translators, sworn/authorized translators and interpreters, conference interpreters, public- service interpreters and audiovisual translators. This process might be seen as a division of labor, a normal result of increasing memberships. Analysis of the communication strategies employed by the associations nevertheless suggests that there has been a profound shift in their very nature: from a model where the association ideally vouches for the professional trustworthiness of several thousands of members, thus implicitly speaking to clients and other professions, we find a tendency toward communication patterns where the association becomes a place for social, pedagogical and political action between its members. The greater density and plexity of the interactions means that the newer associations involve smaller groups of people, selected on the basis of either professional specialization or geographical proximity. Similar interactive models are found in online marketplaces for translations and in communities of volunteer translators, which prove to be innovative not only in promoting interactive communication but also in inventing new ways of signaling translators' trustworthiness. A way forward for the traditional associations might be to adapt some of the communication strategies operative in the electronic marketplaces and among volunteers.","Professionalization; Sociology of translators; Specialization; Translator associations",,,,,,,,"Appadurai, A., Modernity at large (1996) Cultural Dimensions of Globalization, , Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press; Brown, S.A., Do interpreters translate?

All these features concern translation, not only to the extent that they create social demands for translations but more importantly in that they give our research an ethical and political dimension, in addition to the demands of various markets. However, when the consequences of these commitments are compared with actual European research and public policies concerning translation, several shortcomings become apparent. The comparison suggests that future tasks for Translation Studies in Europe should include: (1) serious attention to far more than the large territorial languages; (2) enhanced exchange with neighboring disciplines, especially with scholars working on language acquisition; (3) an acceptance that translated communication should concern involvement and interaction, in addition to public information; (4) a questioning of the Western translation form as the model best suited to interactive cross-lingual governance; and (5) experimentation with technologies that stimulate citizen involvement. © John Benjamins Publishing Company.","Communicative involvement; European Union; Interdisciplinarity; Language policy; Translation studies",,,,,,,,"Coulmas, F., European integration and the idea of a national language (1991) A Language Policy for the European Community Prospects and Quandaries, pp. 1-37. , ed. by Florian Coulmas, Berlin: Mouton de Gruyter.

While such a statement undoubtedly is a stand against national - or, in many instances, nationalistic - language cultures, it also raises a series of questions which can be discussed within a re-formulation of EST's aims and scope: Which 'Europe' is meant here? What sort of translation concept underpins this statement? In which way do migration movements shape today's translation landscapes? What are the control mechanisms behind the phenomenon of translation understood in Eco's sense? This paper discusses the limits of Europeanness and its potentially transgressive nature against the backdrop of EST's founding moment in Vienna and the city's central shaping force in pluricultural issues in the Habsburg Monarchy. It argues that translation has the task of breaking the deadlock of identitarian differences and the political practices based on them. So, what is the impact of these reflections for future activities in EST? © John Benjamins Publishing Company.","Eurocentrism; European society of translation studies; Étienne Balibar; Habsburg Monarchy; Translation concept",,,,,,,,"Balibar, E., (2004) We, the People of Europe?

First, instrumental thinking is introduced as a general mode of thinking which can be traced across different academic disciplines. A critical position is adopted with reference to Horkheimer/Adorno and Bourdieu. Based on Bourdieu's work on ""the state of the unthought"" and the ""pre-constructed,"" some examples from academic discourse are discussed to foreground how a certain type of instrumental thinking is linked to market-oriented politics and how this shapes concepts in academic discourse as well. It is argued that the effects of the instrumental can be found on several levels in Translation Studies and that these levels are interrelated. These include the ways translation is understood and approached in practice by interaction partners involved in translation and interpreting processes, in the discourses on translation and interpretation in fields outside academia, and in scholarly work on translation. © John Benjamins Publishing Company.","Instrumental thinking; Market-orientation; Pre-constructed notions; Translation as instrument; Transparency and opaqueness of translation",,,,,,"European Commission","We might come closer to describing the problem with the help of Drexel’s analysis on the genesis of the concept. She shows how the concept was championed by the European Commission, which contributed the central ideas and the strategy for the concept’s implementation in European societies, as well as the necessary funding for research (Drexel 2003). In the following, I will summarize some aspects of Drexel’s analysis that show how the concept of competence can work as a tool to put translation research and training to the service of the market (6–7; 11–12).","Bahadir, S., Verknüpfungen und verschiebungen (2007) Dolmetscherin, Dolmetschforscherin, Dolmetschausbilderin, , Berlin: Frank und Timme; (1999) The Bologna Declaration, , http://www.bolognabergen2005.no/Docs/00-Main_doc/ 990719BOLOGNA_DECLARATION.PDF, of 19 June, Accessed October 17, 2013; (2013) The Bologna Process - Towards the Higher Education Area, , http://ec.europa.eu/education/higher-education/bologna_en.htm, Accessed October 17; Boyden, M., Beyond 'Eurocentrism'?

Miriam Shlesinger went to Assessti meetings on behalf of EST and gave her input to the ongoing research, but also reported that the quality of the project seemed mediocre. In view of this situation and the fact that the contract signed by EST entailed financial risks for the Society (if at the end of the project, European authorities deemed its outcome unsatisfactory, EST would have to reimburse sums it had been paid to cover its costs associated with the project), it was decided that the Society would withdraw from the project.","ACLS - American Council of Learned Societies, , http://www.acls.org/societies/work.aspx?id=1264; AIIC - International Association of Conference Interpreters, , http://aiic.net/search/tags/training-of-trainers, Training of Trainers; BITRA - Bibliography of Interpreting and Translation, , http://aplicacionesua.cpd.ua.es/tra_int/usu/buscar.asp?idioma=en; Chesterman, A., A personal message from andrew chesterman (1999) EST Newsletter, 14, p. 3. , (June 1999); Franco Aixelá, J., Un cálculo preliminar del impacto de las publicaciones de traducción e interpretación escritas originalmente en español (2010) Traducción Y Modernidad.

This pilot study focuses on a less-known phenomenon of that period: translation policy. From 1790 on, several decrees stipulated the translation of national laws and decrees into the regional languages of France and some languages of other European countries. We will illustrate this translation policy focusing on translations of political and administrative texts from French into Flemish in Belgium (which was annexed by the French Republic in 1795 and remained French until the end of the Napoleonic era). We will not only try to shed some light on the conditions under which the translations published in Belgium were produced, but also analyze some typical examples drawn from different genres.","Belgium; Flemish (Dutch) language; French language; French Revolution; Translation policy",,,,,,,,"Balibar, R., L'institution du Français (1985) Essai sur le colinguisme des Carolingiens à la République, , Paris: PUF; Behling, A., De Metsenaere, M., De taalsituatie in het lager onderwijs te Brussel tijdens de Franse periode (1795-1814) (1979) Taal en Sociale Integratie, 2, pp. 235-259; Bellefroid, P., De code-vertalingen in den Franschen tijd (1932) Verslagen en Mededelingen der Koninklijke Vlaamsche Academie voor Taal- en Letterkunde, pp. 87-108. , Gent: Koninklijke Vlaamsche Academie voor Taal- en Letterkunde; Brunot, F., Flamand et français sous la domination française (1932) Revue Franco-Belge, 12, pp. 135-180; Brunot, F., Histoire de la langue française des origines à nos jours (1967) La Révolution et l'Empire.

The objective of the present article is twofold. First, it aims to recontextualize the 'subservience hypothesis' by shedding light on the empirical work underlining it. Second, following the approach developed in Simeoni (2001), the author tests again the hypothesis through textual analysis, by studying the early translation history into French of a textbook entitled Marketing Management by Philip Kotler. The author explores to what extent traces of the primordial norm, as defined by Simeoni (2001), can be found in the first four French editions of this scholarly text produced over the period (1967-1981), two of which were signed by a professional translator and the others by a marketing scholar.","Daniel Simeoni; Habitus; Marketing; Philip Kotler; Primordial norm; Social sciences; Subservience; Translation language",,,,,,,,"Kotler, P., (1967) Marketing Management: Analysis, Planning and Control, p. 628. , Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice Hall; Kotler, P., (1972) Marketing Management: Analysis, Planning and Control, 14, p. 885. , 2nd ed.

Readability formulas have been suggested to be a useful tool and yet this needs to be empirically tested. In this study, NASA Task Load Index, a multidimensional scale for measuring mental workload, was used to assess the level of translation difficulty for the translator. It was found that a text's readability only partially accounts for its translation difficulty level. Translation quality score was found to be an unreliable indicator of translation difficulty level, while time-on-task was significantly, but weakly, related to translation difficulty level. A formula was developed to predict a text's translation difficulty level for a translator by using the translator's pre-translation rating.","Cognitive; Competence; Difficulty; Empirical workload; Measurement; Method; Readability; Translation",,,,,,,,"Anagnostou, N.K., Weir, G.R.S., From corpus-based collocation frequencies to readability measure (2007) Texts, Textbooks and Readability, pp. 34-48. , Ed. by George R.

It analyses eleven translators' 'outputs' of Scots and English translations from Giuseppe Belli's 19th-century regionallanguage sonnets, which are set in working-class Rome. Each output was coded for voice (space, community, tenor marking), text-world space, and poetic form (rhyme, rhythm), then analysed quantitatively and qualitatively; translator interviews and translators' written commentaries provided extra data. Translators ranged along a spectrum (apparently genre-specific) between two extremes: (1) 'relocalising' voice into target regional language/dialect with similar workingclass and informal features to Belli's originals, whilst relocalising place and person names to target-country analogies, and recreating rhyme and rhythm; (2) translating into standard (supra-regional, literary/educated, neutral-toformal) English, whilst preserving Belli's Roman setting, but replacing rhyme and rhythm by free verse. This reflects a spectrum between two priorities: (1) creatively conveying poetic texture; (2) replicating surface semantics.","English; Italian; Poetry; Regional dialect; Rhyme; Rhythm; Scots; Voice",,,,,,,,"Allén, S., (1999) Translation of Poetry and Poetic Prose, , Singapore: World Scientific; Armstrong, N., Federici, F.M., Introduction (2006) Translating Voices, Translating Regions, pp. 11-15. , Ed. by Nigel Armstrong, and Federico M.

Examining discussions of the nature of drama and theatre - that see them as performative rather than representative entities (Worthen 2003; Schechner 2002) - this article argues for a rethinking of the interdisciplinary relations between translation and theatre in the context of wider debates over the value of interdisciplinarity in translation studies (Pym 1998; Chesterman 2010; Bassnett 2012). Drawing on the contributions to this special issue, the social dimension of translation and the performative nature of culture are brought to the fore as productive new ways of studying translation in the theatre as a performative and social as well as a linguistic practice. © John Benjamins Publishing Company.","Interdisciplinarity; Performance; Performative; Translation agency; Translation and theatre",,,,,,,,"Aaltonen, S., (2000) Time-sharing on Stage.

Professing translation as a model for the resolution of entrenched binaries (scholar/artist; theoretician/practitioner), the author sees the practice of translating for performance not just as a method of discovery or a hermeneutic tool but also as a mode of reflection that brings together both ""readerly"" and ""writerly"" approaches to text (Barthes 1974). By drawing on the experience of writing translations of García Lorca for the Belgrade Theatre, Calderón for the Royal Shakespeare Company, and Lope de Vega for the Watermill Theatre and the Washington Shakespeare Theatre, the article attempts to characterise such translation as an act of physical imagination, of a holistic understanding of both language and performance, into which textuality is incorporated and by which it is superseded. © John Benjamins Publishing Company.","Hermeneutics; Performance; Practice; Reading; Translation; Writing",,,,,,,,"Agamben, G., (1998) Homo Sacer: Sovereign Power and Bare Life, , Stanford: Stanford University Press; Barber, K., Text and performance in Africa (2003) Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies, 6 (3), pp. 324-333; Barthes, R., (1974) S/Z.

Not only do they explore their bilingualism in plays that incorporate Canada's two official languages, they enhance the bilingual aesthetics of the original play with the use of surtitles. In addition to conventional surtitles translating the source text delivered orally on stage, creative surtitles transmit new messages and thus multiply the possible readings generated by the performance. Thus, translation achieves a certain autonomy within the theatre production and, in doing so, redefines its function while challenging the existing theoretical models applied to the translation of dramatic texts. © John Benjamins Publishing Company.","Bilingualism; Creative surtitles; Franco-Canadian; On-stage translation; Theatre",,,,,,,,"Auger, R., Je m'en vais à Régina (2007) Suite Manitobaine, pp. 17-109. , Saint Boniface, MB: Les Éditions du Blé; Bassnett-McGuire, S., Ways through the labyrinth: Strategies and methods for translating teatre texts (1985) The Manipulation of Literature: Studies in Literar y Translation, pp. 87-102. , ed. by Teo Hermans London: Croom Helm; Bourdieu, P., (1979) La Distinction: Critique Sociale du Jugement, , Paris: Minuit; Brown, K., (2010) Cow-boy Poétré, , Partial French translation by Laurier Gareau.

Synge's canonical Irish play The Playboy of the Western World. Director Gavin Quinn chose to set the adaptation in a hairdresser/massage parlour/brothel, on the outskirts of Beijing. He originally wanted the protagonist to hail from Xin-Jiang, China's troubled Sinomuslim province. In interview, he said he was advised against this for fear of Chinese state censorship. However, the Chinese translators, Yue Sun and Zhaohui Wang, suggest that the decision not to represent a Muslim protagonist had to do with ethnic sensitivities. In order to analyse this conflict, this article draws on translation sociology after Bourdieu, clarifying the functioning of the habitus, and formulating a global field of cultural production. It argues that analysis of intercultural processes focused on cultural capital can provide materially engaged insights into the power relations informing given intercultural situations. © John Benjamins Publishing Company.","Adaptation; Bourdieu; Capital; Interculturalism; Postcolonialism; Theatre; Translation",,,,,,,,"Amine, K., Taswir: Beyond east and west (2010) Performing Cultural Diversity, Critiquing Postcolonialism, pp. 75-80. , ed. by Khalid Amine, Barry Taraud, José Manuel Goñi Pérez, and George F.

The advertisements, newspaper pre-reviews and reviews named Reita Lounatvuori, a well-known Finnish theatre translator, as the author of the translation. However, several other people were also involved in the translation process before Mouawad's text reached the stage. In my article, I offer an empirical study of the process of translation of Incendies into Finnish to argue that translations in the theatre are not objects of art but products of art worlds, bearing the fingerprints of many subjectivities. To support my argument, I draw on Actor-Network Theory, as recently developed in the context of translation sociology (Buzelin 2007, 2005; Bogic 2010), and on Performance Studies, following Richard Schechner's articulation of the concept of performance (Schechner 2013). I apply these models to the specific context of the theatre, the specific genre of drama, and the process of translating one play.

The questions asked include: What are the ramifications of translating Chinese literature carrying anglophobic themes into English? How might translation displace anglophobic readings from Chinese literary works? What kind of identity discourse do self-translation practices engender? The article examines three cases of cross-linguistic practice as biliterate modalities in Singapore, with an eye on the identity discourse emanating from the translational space between English and Chinese in each case. In the first case, it is argued that the English translation of a Chinese poem with an anglophobic stance triggers an ironic self-reflexivity on the part of the target text reader and has the potential to exacerbate the cultural anxiety faced by the Chinese-speaking Self in the source text. The second case presents an example where the anglophobic interpretation of a Chinese play can potentially be 'unread' through the homogenization of code-switching through translation. In the final case of a self-translating playwright, it is found that English-Chinese and Chinese-English translations establish an asymmetric symbiosis whereby translation creates an interliminal space in which a hybrid identity discourse is negotiated. The three cases illustrate the tensions and paradoxes residing in the translational space between English and Chinese in Singapore, pointing to the problematic of inter-and cross-cultural communication in the multilingual state. © John Benjamins Publishing Company.","Anglophobia; Biliterate modality; Identity discourse; Language ideology; Translation",,,,,,,,"Antoine, B., La traduction comme épreuve de l'étranger (1985) Texte, 4, pp. 67-81. , Trans.

However, despite the pervasiveness of the concepts, there is little existing empirical research investigating how child (and adult) readers of translated children's books process and respond to foreignised elements in translation. This means that scholars' arguments in favour of either domestication or foreignisation in the translation of children's literature are often based on intuition and personal experience, with no substantial empirical basis. This article presents the findings of an experiment undertaken to investigate Afrikaans child and adult readers' processing of and responses to potentially linguistically and culturally foreign textual elements in translated children's picturebooks, against the background of postcolonial/neocolonial cultural and linguistic hybridity in South Africa. The paper reports the results relating to two of the research questions informing the study: 1. Does the use of foreignised elements in translated children's picturebooks have any significant effect on the cognitive effort involved in reading for child and adult readers? 2. Is the comprehension of child and adult readers affected by the use of foreignised elements in translated children's picturebooks? A reading study utilising eye-tracking was conducted, involving both child and adult participants reading manipulated domesticated and foreignised versions of pages from two picturebooks translated from English to Afrikaans. To answer research question (1), data obtained by means of eye-tracking were analysed for dwell time, fixation count, first fixation duration and glances count for areas of interest (AOIs) reflecting domesticating or foreignising translation strategies. In order to answer question (2), short structured questionnaires or interviews with participants were used, focusing on the degree of comprehension of the two texts. Overall, the findings of the experiment demonstrate that while there are perceptible effects on processing and comprehension associated with the use of foreignising strategies, these effects are not straightforward or uniform, with notable differences not only for different AOIs, but also for child and adult readers. © John Benjamins Publishing Company.","Child readers; Children's literature; Comprehension; Domestication; Empirical translation studies; Eyetracking; Foreignisation; Reading; Translation",,,,,,,,"Valerie, A., Tatjana, A.N., Developing normal reading skills: Aspects of the visual processes underlying word recognition (2000) Journal of Experimental Child Psychology, 76, pp. 123-150; Fabio, A., (2003) Triangulating Translation: Perspectives in Process-Oriented Research, , Amsterdam: John Benjamins; Alvstad, C., Hild, A., Tiselius, E., (2011) Methods and Strategies of Process Research: Integrative Approaches in Translation Studies, , Amsterdam: John Benjamins; Els, A., Penetrating the dutch polysystem: The reception of virginia woolf, 1920-2000 (2006) Poetics Today, 27 (3), pp. 501-568; Blythe, H.I., Holly, S.S.L.J., Children's eye movements during reading (2011) The Oxford Handbook of Eye Movements, pp. 643-662. , ed.

Our case is that of existential there in English and existential il y a in French. Using corpus evidence, we first confirm previous claims that existential there is used more freely in English than existential il y a is in French. Drawing on extensive counts conducted in available corpora and self-compiled samples of translated English and French, intra-language comparisons of translated and non-translated language use show that existential there is under-represented in English translated from French while existential il y a is over-represented in French translated from English. It is suggested that source-language interference is responsible for these differences. In addition, counts of existentials in individual novels and their translations show that inter-language frequency shifts systematically occur in the direction of target-language norms, most clearly so for translations into French, which suggests that the observed usage constraint on il y a still applies to a noticeable extent in translated French. Methodologically, we argue the need for a large corpus of translated French. © John Benjamins Publishing Company.","Corpus-based translation studies; English; Existential construction; French; Frequency; Interference; Methodology; Source-language; Targetlanguage norms; Translation universals; Usage constraint",,,,,,,,"Mona, B., Corpus linguistics and translation studies: Implications and applications (1993) Text and Technology, pp. 233-250. , ed.

It is argued that this discipline has used her name in an impressionistic way and, therefore, it seems necessary to complement the translation scholar's approach with that of the historian. The paper will explore the ways in which Doña Marina has been presented by translation scholars. The next section will provide the perspective of historians, focusing on three aspects relevant for Translation Studies: (1) the facts known about her origin, which explain her ability to communicate in two local languages, (2) her role as interpreter during the conquest of Mexico, (3) her alleged participation in the Cholulan massacre as an informant of Cortés. It will conclude with a discussion that aims to highlight the contrast between the use of impressionistic views of historic figures and the more balanced narratives based on factual rather than mythical elements. © John Benjamins Publishing Company.","Conquest; Doña Marina/La Malinche; Historiographical approach; Interpreter; Traitor",,,,,,"University of Massachusetts, UMASS: PR2011–511","* I would like to express my gratitude to the Spanish Ministry of Education for funding my visiting professorship at the University of Massachusetts (PR2011–511), and to Edwin Gentzler for his kind invitation to join UMass Translation Center during the academic year 2011–2012.

Building on the experimental paradigm of data triangulation in translation process research (Alves 2003; Jakobsen 2005), it analyses the translation processes of eight professional translators when performing a direct and an inverse translation task. The analysis focuses on the number and types of encodings found in micro/macro translation units (Alves and Vale 2009; 2011). Results suggest that processing effort in translation is greater in instances of procedural than conceptual encodings. © John Benjamins Publishing Company.","Conceptual and procedural encodings; Micro/macro translation units; Processing effort in translation; Relevance theory; Translation process research",,,,,,"SHA/PPM-00280-10, ETC-00009-11

For balance, it is also necessary and insightful to describe and explain how strategies of comprehending, decision-making and re-verbalisation come about in a translator's bilingual mind. In this paper I sketch some ideas about such a new linguistic-cognitive approach. I first review introspective and retrospective studies and behavioural experiments. Secondly, I assess the value of neuro-linguistic studies for translation. Thirdly, I suggest a new combination of a translation theory and a neuro-functional theory of bilingualism. © John Benjamins Publishing Company.","Consciousness; Introspection; Neuro-linguistic studies; Neuro-linguistic theory of bilingualism; Overt and covert translation; Pragmatics; Systemic-functional translation theory",,,,,,,,"Abutalebi, J., Neural aspects of second language representation and language control (2008) Acta Psychologica, 128, pp. 466-478; Alves, F., Pagano, A., Neumann, S., Steiner, E., Hansen-Schirra, S., Translation units and grammatical shifts: Towards an integration of product- and process-based translation research (2010) Translation and Cognition, pp. 109-142. , ed. by Gregory Shreve and Erik Angelone, Amsterdam: John Benjamins; Aue, T., Lavelle, L., Cacioppo, J., Great expectations: What can fMRI research tell us about psychological phenomena?

One such development is the recognition of the extended nature of human cognition: Cognition is not just an information manipulation process in the brain, it is contextualized action embedded in a body and increasingly mediated by technologies and situated in its socio-cultural environment. Parallel developments are found in neighbouring disciplines, such as sociology with its actor-network and activity theories. This paper examines these approaches, their shared methodological tenets (i.e., ethnographic field studies) and the implications of the situated cognition approach for describing the cognitive aspects of translation, using a translation management case study to discuss conceptual and methodological issues. © John Benjamins Publishing Company.","Activity theory; Actor-network theory; Extended cognition; Extended translation; Networking; Situated cognition; Sociocognition; Specialization; Translation culture; Translation management",,,,,,,,"Abdallah, K., Quality problems in AVT production networks: Reconstructing an actor-network in the subtitling industry (2011) Audiovisual Translation in Close-up: Practical and Theoretical Approaches, pp. 173-186. , ed. by Adriana Serban, Anna Matamala, and Jean-Marc Lavaur.

To date, however, there is little agreement on the most suitable method to measure this phenomenon. In this contribution, I set out to discuss four of the most common methods of measuring cognitive load and the way in which they have been applied in interpreting research, providing examples for each and highlighting their respective advantages and disadvantages. The main focus of the contribution will be on pupillometry, a psycho-physiological method I deem to be among the most promising approaches to objectively measure cognitive load during simultaneous interpreting in real time. © John Benjamins Publishing Company.","Analytical methods; Cognitive load; Mental effort; Methodology; Performance methods; Psycho-physiological methods; Pupillometry; Simultaneous interpreting; Subjective methods",,,,,,,,"Andreassi, J.L., (2000) Psychophysiology: Human Behavior and Physiological Response, , 4th ed.

Suggestions for future developments are made, including ways in which the domain of cognitive translatology might exert greater influence on other disciplines. © John Benjamins Publishing Company.","Cognition; Cognitive translatology; Interdisciplinarity; Reciprocity; Translation process research",,,,,,,,"Agrifoglio, M., Sight translation and interpreting: A comparative analysis of constraints and failures (2004) Interpreting - International Journal of Research and Practice in Interpreting, 6 (1), pp. 43-68; Alves, F., (2003) Triangulating Translation, , Amsterdam: John Benjamins; Alves, F., Pagano, A., Neumann, S., Steiner, E., Hansen-Schirra, S., Translation units and grammatical shifts: Towards an integration of product- and process-based translation research (2010) Translation and Cognition, pp. 109-142. , ed. by Gregory Shreve and Erik Angelone.

It presents some developments within translation studies that make use of conceptual metaphor theory and illustrates some process research methods for investigating metaphors. The paper considers a number of methodological recommendations and argues that the need to take full account of insights from metaphor studies and associated disciplines is of greatest importance. Another significant potential innovation is the use of a multilingual approach in respect of both product- and process-oriented studies in order to increase both the amount and the generality of data available for analysis. Thirdly, it is important to extend the current source-text (ST) oriented approach. The paper concludes by suggesting some options for triangulating data gathered through a combination of methods. © John Benjamins Publishing Company.","Eye tracking; Keystroke logging; Metaphor; Metaphor studies; Multilingual approach; TAPs; Translation process research; Triangulation",,,,,,,,"Al-Harrasi, A., (2001) Metaphor in (Arabic-into-English) Translation with Specific Reference to Metaphorical Concepts and Expressions in Political Discourse, , Unpublished PhD thesis, Aston University; Alves, F., Pagano, A., Neumann, S., Steiner, E., Hansen-Schirra, S., Translation units and grammatical shifts. towards an integration of product and process-based translation research (2010) Translation and Cognition, pp. 109-141. , ed. by Gregory M.

It shows how the collaboration between phoneticians, translators and interpreters can (1) advance research, (2) have implications for the curriculum, (3) be pedagogically motivating, and (4) prepare students for employing translation technology in their future practice as translators. In a two-phase study in which 14 MA students translated texts in three modalities (sight, written, and oral translation using an SR program), Translog was employed to measure task times. The quality of the products was assessed by three experienced translators, and the number and types of misrecognitions were identified by a phonetician. Results indicate that SR translation provides a potentially useful supplement to written translation, or indeed an alternative to it. © John Benjamins Publishing Company.","Oral translation; Productivity; Pronunciation; Sight translation; Speech recognition; Translation modalities; Written translation",,,,,,,,"Agrifoglio, M., Sight translation and interpreting: A comparative analysis of constraints and failures (2004) Interpreting, 6 (1), pp. 43-67; Chafe, W., Danielewicz, J., Properties of spoken and written language (1987) Comprehending Oral and Written Language, pp. 83-113. , ed. by Rosalind Horowitz and S.

The investigation made use of a comparable corpus consisting of a subcorpus of English texts translated from Afrikaans, a subcorpus of comparable edited English texts, and a subcorpus of comparable unedited (and also untranslated) English texts. The frequency and distribution of linguistic features associated with three of the universals of translated language (explicitation, normalisation/conservatism, and simplification) across the three subcorpora were analysed. The study was guided by the hypothesis that the frequency and distribution of linguistic features associated with the universals of translated language would demonstrate similarities in the two subcorpora of mediated text (i.e., the translated and edited subcorpus), as compared to the subcorpus of unmediated text (i.e., the unedited subcorpus). However, the study yields almost no evidence for a mediation effect that is shared by translated and edited language, at least not along the linguistic features investigated. There is, however, evidence for what appears to be a separate translation-specific effect, which seems likely to be more unconscious, more proceduralised and more related to the linguistic level alone. This offers some support for the hypothesis of universals of translated language that are unique to this kind of text mediation specifically. Furthermore, the findings of the study suggest that editing may involve a different kind of mediation effect altogether, which frequently remains invisible in conventional corpus-based studies comparing translated and non-translated language, and which requires further investigation. © John Benjamins Publishing Company.","Cognitive approaches; Corpus-based approach; Edited language; Mediation; Universals of translated language",,,,,,,,"Alves, F., Pagano, A., Neumann, S., Steiner, E., Silvia, H.-S., Translation units and grammatical shifts: Towards an integration of product- and process-based translation research (2010) Translation and Cognition, pp. 109-142. , ed. by Gregory M.

By doing so, the paper intends to contribute to a deeper understanding of indirect translation. Firstly, relevant information concerning the corpus is presented. Secondly, the methodological issues are elucidated. Thirdly, the results of the study are discussed in detail. More specifically, the correlations between the dependent variables (directness and indirectness) and the independent variables (author profile, translator profile, publisher profile and target text literary genre) are examined. In addition, the correlation between the occurrence of the label '(in)direct' is tested against the independent time variable. Finally, the preliminary conclusions and future research avenues are presented. © John Benjamins Publishing Company.","Centre-periphery relationships; Indirect translation; Intercultural relationships; Literary translation; Polish literature; Portuguese language",,,,,,"Fundo Regional para a CiÃªncia e Tecnologia, FRCT","The research for this article was undertaken with the aid of research grant SFRH/BD/44203/2008, funded by the Fundação para a Ciência e Tecnologia (FCT), Portugal.

This study characterizes the translation task as schema-based, and thus prone to cognitive overload for the learner. Accordingly, schema acquisition tasks featuring reduced-goal specificity and goal-free problems for training the novice are reviewed. The argument is put forward that we need 1) to use more scaffolding to reduce cognitive load, 2) to vary task architecture for learning (including the use of planning pre-tasks), and 3) to provide diagnostic help for the student translator to attain context-independence for 'high road transfer'. Formats for expertise modeling are considered - reverse tasks, completion examples, and other whole-task models - as instructional designs for load-managed translation tasks that improve problem-solving, schema acquisition, process-orientation, and metacognitive monitoring. © John Benjamins Publishing Company.","Cognitive load (intrinsic; Context-independence; Extraneous; Germane); Goal-free problems; Modeling; Scaffolding; Task design; Transfer; Unconscious competence; Whole-task training",,,,,,,,"Ambrose, S.A., Bridges, M.W., DiPietro, M., Lovett, M.C., Norman, M.K., (2010) How Learning Works: Seven Research-based Principles for Smart Teaching, , San Francisco, CA: Jossey-Bass; Bruner, J.S., (1960) The Process of Education, , Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press; Clark, R.C., Mayer, R.E., (2008) E-learning and the Science of Instruction: Proven Guidelines for Consumers and Designers of Multimedia Learning, , San Francisco, CA: Pfeiffer; Clark, R.C., (2010) Evidence-based Training Methods: A Guide for Training Professionals, , Alexandria, VA: ASTD Press; Clark, R.C., Nguyen, F., Sweller, J., (2006) Efficiency in Learning: Evidence-based Guidelines to Manage Cognitive Load, , San Francisco, CA: John Wiley & Sons, Inc; Collins, A., Brown, J.S., Newman, S.E., Cognitive apprenticeship: Teaching the crafts of reading, writing, and mathematics (1989) Knowing, Learning and Instruction: Essays in Honor of Robert Glaser, pp. 453-494. , ed. by L.

This article gives a brief overview of these projects, and discusses in more depth the example of my own application and development of narrative theory. This includes a revised typology of narratives, the combination of narratological and sociological approaches, an intratextual model of analysis, and a new emphasis on the importance of narrators and temporary narrators in the (re)configuration of narratives. The article ends with a brief discussion on further topics within Translation and Interpreting Studies to which narrative theory might be applied. © John Benjamins Publishing Company.","Beslan; Narrator(s); News reporting; Online media; Research methodology; Russia; Russian/English; Socio-narrative theory; Textual analysis",,,,,,,,"Aaltonen, S., 'Noni sosökokeror alolotosa asyl?'

The aim is to link translations to the broader context, highlighting modalities and expectations of reception that have evolved within the social structures through which the translation of contemporary Chinese poetry has been circulating: the publishing industry, universities, the periodical press, public intellectual debates, and the market. The article does not try to establish if this or that expectation are either real or perceived features of the source texts. Nor does it deal with translators' individual interpretations, their private readings. Instead, adopting a wider sociocultural approach, the analysis proposes to shed light on the industrial and commercial dimension - the public life - of contemporary Chinese poetry in English translation. © John Benjamins Publishing Company.","Contemporary Chinese poetry; Expectations; Public debate; Publishing industry; Reception; Sociocultural approach to translation",,,,,,,,"Anderson, B., (1983) Imagined Communities, , London: Verso; Barmé, G., Minford, J., (1989) Seeds of Fire: Voices of Chinese Conscience, , New York: Hill & Wang; Barnstone, T., Translation as forgery.

In order to achieve that goal, we gathered a diverse set of linguistic variables and used a 10-million-word corpus that is parallel, comparable and bidirectional (the Dutch Parallel Corpus; Macken et al. 2011). The frequency counts for each of the variables are used to determine the differences in standard language use by means of profile-based correspondence analysis (Plevoets 2008). The results of our analysis show that (i) in general, there is indeed a standardizing trend among translations and (ii) text types with a lot of editorial control (fiction, non-fiction and journalistic texts) contain more standard language than the less edited text types (administrative texts and external communication) which adds support for the idea that the differences between translated and non-translated texts are text type dependent. © John Benjamins Publishing Company.","Belgian Dutch; Profile-based correspondence analysis; Standardization; Text type; Translated versus non-translated language",,,,,,,,"Baker, M., Corpus linguistics and translation studies.

The article traces the gradual rise of translation studies as an important field in its own right, but raises questions about the present state of the discipline, arguing that as translation studies has become more established, so it is failing to challenge orthodoxies and risks being left behind by the more innovative and exciting research now emerging from within world literature, postcolonialism, and cultural memory studies.

After presenting the fundamental methodological hurdles - and advantages - of working on machine-readable (transcribed) oral corpora, we present and discuss several recent studies using cross-modal comparisons, and examine the viability of using interpreted outputs to explore the features that set simultaneous interpreting apart from other forms of translation.

These changes have given rise to new terms within translation practice, including new job titles, and these do not always promote better understanding of the various translation markets. At the same time, TS is becoming more international. In addition, the increased use of technology is blurring the ways in which ""texts"" are produced, distributed and received. This rapid development is often linked solely to an economic rationale, still largely ignored in TS. After the productive years of 1980-1990, with a predominant focus on canonical and sacred texts, TS seems to have come to a standstill: its object is uncertain, its social relevance is questionable, and its fragmentation is sometimes perceived as a handicap, sometimes as a sign of vitality.

Translation studies has explored many facets of the processes and products of translation and interpreting, ranging from the linguistic aspects to the textual aspects, from the politics of translation to implications from cognitive science, but little is known about the production and reception of translation at the level of the individual brain and the level of molecular biology. 1 Much of this terra incognita will be explored and illuminated by neuroscience in the coming quarter century, and significant discoveries pertaining to language processing in translation will be made during the coming decade, linking observable behaviors at the macro level with knowledge of what happens in the production and reception of translation at the micro level of the neuron and the neuronal pathways of the brain. In the past two decades powerful new techniques for observing brain function in healthy living individuals have been devised. To a large extent neuroscience has become a rapidly developing field because of new technologies that make it possible to monitor the brain as it actually works, to document neural pathways, and even to track the activity of specific neurons. This article focuses on discoveries in neuroscience pertaining to perception, memory, and brain plasticity that have already achieved consensus in the field and that have durable implications for the ways we will think about translation in the future. ©2012 John Benjamins Publishing Company.","Brain; Cultural shaping; Memory; Neuroscience; Perception; Plasticity",,,,,,,,"Colapinto, J., Brain games (2009) New Yorker, 8, pp. 76-87. , May; Danks, J.H., Shreve, G.M., Fountain, S.B., McBeath, M.K., (1997) Cognitive Processes in Translation and Interpreting, , Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage Publications; De Groot, Annette, M.B., Kroll, J.F., (1997) Tutorials in Bilingualism: Psycholinguistic Perspectives, , Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates; Ellis, N.C., Selective attention and transfer phenomena in l2 acquisition: Contingency, cue competition, salience, interference, overshadowing, blocking, and perceptual learning (2006) Applied Linguistics, 27 (2), pp. 164-194; Fields, R.D., White matter matters (2008) Scientific American, pp. 54-61. , March; Gawande, A., The itch (2008) New Yorker, pp. 58-65. , June. 30; Gladwell, M., (2005) Blink: The Power of Thinking Without Thinking, , New York: Little, Brown, and Company; Goldsmith, T.H., What birds see (2006) Scientific American, pp. 68-75; Holcombe, A.O., Seeing slow and seeing fast: Two limits on perception (2009) Trends in Cognitive Sciences, 13 (5), pp. 216-221; Kandel, E.R., (2006) Search of Memory: The Emergence of A New Science of Mind, , New York: Norton; Nida, E.A., (1964) Toward A Science of Translating: With Special Reference to Principles and Procedures Involved in Bible Translating, , Leiden: E.

As a representative of the ""second generation"" and drawing on recent publications in journals and monographs on Translation Studies, I provide an overview of where young translation scholars who claim to take a ""functionalist"" viewpoint find themselves, what they are investigating, and which topics they consider worthy of research.

It illustrates discursive events in the domain of politics and the resulting discourse types, such as jointly produced texts, press conferences and speeches. It shows that methods of Critical Discourse Analysis can be used effectively to reveal translation and interpreting strategies as well as transformations that occur in recontextualisation processes across languages, cultures, and discourse domains, in particular recontextualisation in mass media. It argues that the complexity of translational activities in the field of politics has not yet seen sufficient attention within Translation Studies. The article concludes by outlining a research programme for investigating political discourse in translation. ©2012 John Benjamins Publishing Company.","Agency; Critical Discourse Analysis; Political discourse; Political institution; Recontextualisation",,,,,,,,"Baker, M., (2006) Translation and Conflict: A Narrative Account, , New York and London: Routledge; Baumgarten, S., Gagnon, C., Written political discourse in translation.

Our goals are to analyze the structure of the subjective knowledge of translators and to determine their role in the process of translation, but also to develop a specific research method. From a theoretical point of view the study is based on our model of the nature, the function and the acquisition of subjective theories of translation. The analysis of metaphors is based on conceptual metaphor theory and on empirical research on metaphor in applied linguistics. Both the model and the research method have proved to be useful for the investigation of implicit theories about translation. © John Benjamins Publishing Company.","Cognitive traductology; Implicit theories; Metaphor; Subjective theories; Translation",,,,,,,,"Baldauf, C., (1997) Metapher und Kognition.

But more research is needed on actual people involved in the production, distribution, and reception of translation, and factors affecting these inter-relations. In this article, my interest is in agency in the translation and production of James Morier's picaresque novel, The Adventures of Hajji Baba of Ispahan (1824) into Persian. Drawing on Persia's politics, society and culture of the 19th century, I contextualize both the English and the Persian texts and show how Mirza Habib Isfahani, the translator, intervened in the text in order to exercise his exilic agency. The translator's interventions in the text show that for him the ethics of political progress was more important than the ethics of fidelity to foreign text. The article also examines the agency of other translation agents: the English Major in charge of the editing and publication of the Persian translation in Calcutta; and a Persian dissident and copyist whose tragic death transformed his posthumous agency from a cross-border copyist to a misidentified translator for more than 50 years. © John Benjamins Publishing Company.","19th century Persia; Agency; Intercultural transfers; The Adventures of Hajji Baba of Ispahan; Translation agents",,,,,,,,"Afshar, I., Mirza habibe isfahani (1960) Yaghma, 150, pp. 491-497. , 1339; Afshar, I., The works of mirza habib isfahani (1963) Yaghma, 178, pp. 80-82. , 1342; Altick, R., Introduction (1895) The Adventures of Hajji Baba of Ispahan, pp. vii-xxiv. , James Morier London: Methuen & Random House; Abbas, A., Hajji baba of isfahan (2003) Encyclopedia Iranica, , http://www.iranica.com/articles/hajji-baba-of-ispahan, Accessed January 2011; Armaghan, (1929) A Persian Journal, (2), pp. 110-120. , 1308; Ayandeh, (1980) A Persian Journal, 6 (3-4), pp. 299-303. , 1359; Azarang, A.H., Mirza habib and hajji baba isfahani (2002) Bokhara, pp. 34-52. , 1381; Balaÿ, C., Cuypers, M., (1983) Aux Sources de la Nouvelle Persane, , Paris: Recherche sur les civilisations; Berk Albachten, O., Exile as translation and transformation in early republican Turkey (2010) Translation Studies, 3 (2), pp. 132-148; Browne, E., Introduction (1895) The Adventures of Hajji Baba of Ispahan, pp. ix-xxiii. , James Morier London: Methuen; Browne, E.G., (1910) The Persian Revolution: 1905-1909, , Cambridge: Cambridge University Press; Browne, E.G., (1924) A Literary History of Persia: From Firdawsi to Sadi, 4. , London: Curzon; Bryman, A., (2008) Social Research Methods, , Oxford: Oxford University Press; Chesterman, A., The name and nature of translator studies (2009) Hermes.

Flow (Csikszentmi-halyi 1975) is an optimal experience, characterized by intense focus, control, interest and skills-challenge balance that leads to enhanced performance on a task. Although investigated in areas such as professional sports, surgery, and music, Flow Theory has not yet been tested in the area of translation. This study aimed at identifying which discourse genre would induce most flow in trainee translators while translating. Fifty-six Iranian English Translation majors studying at the University of Kashan translated three 180-word texts of narrative, expository, and descriptive genres. After each translation, they responded to a Flow Perceptions Questionnaire (Egbert, 2003) in the Likert format to report their perceptions of flow. Using repeated measures ANOVA, the researchers investigated flow differences among genres. The results indicated that flow existed in the translation classroom and that there were significant differences in the flow scores engendered by different genres. To support the findings drawn from the numerical analysis, four participants, selected from the population of subjects from the first phase, were interviewed, and the analysis of the interviews generally corroborated the statistical findings. © John Benjamins Publishing Company.","Discourse genre; Flow; Optimal experience; Skills-challenge balance; Translation",,,,,,,,"Abbott, J., ""Blinking out"" and ""having the touch"": Two fifth-grade boys talk about flow experience in writing (2000) Written Communication, 17, pp. 53-92; Abuhamdeh, S., (2000) The Autotelic Personality: An Exploratory Investigation, , Unpublished manuscript.

Through reading Even-Zohar's texts closely and tracing the later developments of the theory, it attempts to explore the complexities of the theory, and clear up some misunderstandings, citing examples from polysystem-inspired case studies. It also discusses the complications caused by the expansion made by Gideon Toury on the concept of ""adequacy"" and ""acceptability"", presents a revised version of Even-Zohar's hypothesis on the situations in which translated literature is likely to occupy a central position, and suggests ways in which polysystem theory can or should be rendered more intricate. It argues that polysystem theory and other cultural theories can be complementary and mutually enriching. © John Benjamins Publishing Company.","Acceptability; Adequacy; Binary opposition; Heterogeneity; Norm; Objectivity; Polysystem theory; System; Translated literature; Weak",,,,,,,,"Agorni, M., Locating systems and individuals in translation studies (2007) Constructing a Sociology of Translation, pp. 1-36. , Michaela Wolf and Alexandra Fukari, eds.

This paper considers the thematic function of translation within recent translingual narrative, where it appears both as a literary topos and as an ideological subtext. It attempts to illustrate how, contrary to postcolonial writers whose narratives self-consciously engage with their own linguistic or cultural hybridity by thematizing the power relationships between different linguistic strands, the narratives of transnational/translingual writers explore new identities by constructing new dialogic spaces in which language choice is located outside the oppositional model set up by the traditional binaries of postcolonial theorizing. Through a reading of the work of Amara Lakhous, a contemporary Italian writer, born and educated in Algiers and writing in both Arabic and Italian, it is argued that translingual works suggest an understanding of translation as not only something that happens after the story ends, but is a crucial part of the narrative itself; one that generates plot and meaning, and is indispensable to an understanding of the concrete processes of cultural translation that shape relationships, identities, and interactions globally. © John Benjamins Publishing Company.",,,,,,,,,"Anderson, B., (1991) Imagined Communities: Reflections on the Origin and Spread of Nationalism, , London and New York: Verso; Appadurai, A., (1996) Modernity at Large: Cultural Dimensions of Globalization, , Minneapolis, MN: University of Minnesota Press; Bakhtin, M., (1984) Problems of Dostoevsky's Poetics, , tr.

The study suggests that translations of irony manifest more explicitations, whereas translations of humor yield more non-explicitating shifts. This finding can be interpreted as indicating that while the explicitation of humor may override its function altogether, the explicitation of irony does not necessarily do so, since the implied criticism is not eliminated.

It argues that the death of the Translator is caused by a loss of human agency in translation and is therefore most clearly exemplified in machine translation. Based on an avant-garde bilingual poetry project by a Taiwanese poet, the paper demonstrates that machine translation can produce unexpected new meanings through unpredictable routes of semantic and syntactic divergences from the source text. The poet's use of transparency as physical medium and of machine translation as mediator raises the following questions: does translation actually allow us to 'read through' a source text? If so, to what extent is such translation 'transparent'? How should we even come to terms with the concept of 'transparency' with respect to the meaning of a literary text in translation? The paper argues that in the bilingual project in question, machine translation plays the crucial function of bringing the reader's attention back to the target language by way of delaying/blocking comprehension, hence rendering the corporeality of the target language 'transparent'. © 2011 John Benjamins Publishing Company.","Death of the translator; Différance; Dissemination; Hsia Yü; Machine translation",,,,,,,,"Barthes, R., (1977) Image, Music, Text, , Trans.

This paper responds to Chesterman's (2004a: 47) call to test explicitation phenomena on different translation modalities and types, and tests the explicitation hypothesis against a comparable web corpus containing 40m words. The fast evolving field of web localization was selected given that (1) if explicitation is a potential universal or general tendency, it should be equally present in current and future translation types; (2) localization is a specific case of translation in which explicitation might not be expected due to space constraints and web usability guidelines; (3) research using comparable web corpora has produced evidence contradicting other proposed general tendencies, such as conventionalization (Jiménez-Crespo 2009a; Kenny 2001). The results of the study confirm that despite specific constraints, localized texts show explicitation if contrasted with non-translated web texts belonging to the same digital genre. © 2011 John Benjamins Publishing Company.","Comparable corpora; Corpus-based translation studies; Explicitation; Tendencies in translation; Universal hypotheses; Web localization",,,,,,,,"Alcina, A., Translation technologies: Scope, tools and resources (2008) Target, 20 (1), pp. 79-102; Austermühl, F., (2001) Electronic Tools for Translators, , Manchester: St Jerome Publishing; Baker, M., Corpus Linguistics and Translation Studies: Implications and applications (1993) Text and Technology: In Honour of John Sinclair, pp. 233-250. , Mona Baker, Gill Francis and Elena Tognini-Bonelli, eds.

Previous research into the effect of foreign accent of witnesses indicated particular foreign accents negatively influence mock jurors' evaluations of the testimony. The aim of this study was to examine the effect of interpreters' foreign accents on the evaluation of witnesses' testimony. Contrary to previous research, our results indicated that participants rated the witness more favourably when testimony was interpreted by an interpreter with a foreign language accent. Accented versions were all rated as more credible, honest, trustworthy and persuasive than the non-accented versions. This paper discusses the findings in the light of methodological concerns and limitations, and highlights the need for further research in the area. © 2011 John Benjamins Publishing Company.","Credibility; Interpreted testimony; Juror evaluations; Native accent; Non native accent",,,,,,,,"Allport, G.W., (1954) The Nature of Prejudice, , Reading: Addison Wesley; Language spoken at home by proficiency in spoken english by sex, Australia (Australia) (2006) Census of Population and Housing, , Australian Bureau of Statistics.

With the aim of stimulating further discussion, particularly in relation to recent developments in the sociology of translation, this article takes the example of L. Frank Baum's The Wizard of Oz (1900) and its adaptation by Alexander Volkov as The Wizard of the Emerald City (Volshebnik izumrudnogo goroda) (1939) in order to explore the relationship between the multiple forces at work in the translation of children's literature under conditions of censorship. By means of an analysis of the differences between the two texts I conclude that censorship is a complex phenomenon which provides fertile ground for the creative manipulation and appropriation of texts and can be considered as an active participant in the creation of an image of a foreign body of literature and its location in a particular literary field. © 2011 John Benjamins Publishing Company.","Bourdieu; Censorship; Children's literature; Sociology of translation; Soviet literature; Translation",,,,,,,,"Aspatore, J.V., (1986) The Military-Patriotic Theme in Soviet Textbooks and Children's Literature, , Unpublished Ph.D. Thesis.

The present article reports on a study whose aim was to elucidate translators' motivations for performing such shifts, focusing on the addition of connectives. The study was carried out on a bidirectional parallel corpus containing translations of business texts between English and German. Connective additions and omissions were identified, counted and analyzed taking into account the surrounding linguistic context of the shift in question, possibly associated shifts performed by the translator, alternative translation options, etc. It was found that the vast majority of identified shifts were attributable to previously established English-German contrasts in terms of syntax, lexis, and communicative norms. The findings suggest that it is unnecessary to assume that translators follow a ""universal strategy"" of explicitation, as it has often been done in the literature (cf. e.g. Blum-Kulka's Explicitation Hypothesis). © 2011 John Benjamins Publishing Company.","Addition; Connective; Explicitation; Implicitation; Omission; Shift; Translation universals",,,,,,"Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG

L3 may appear in the source text (ST) or the target text (TT), actually appearing more frequently in STs in our case studies. We present a range of combinations for the convergence and divergence of L1, L2 and L3, for the case of feature films and their translations using examples from dubbed and subtitled versions of films, but we are hopeful that our tentative conclusions may be relevant to other modalities of translation, audiovisual and otherwise. When L3 appears in an audiovisual ST, we find a variety of solutions whereby L3 is deleted from or adapted to the TT. In the latter case, L3 might be rendered in a number of ways, depending on factors such as the audience's familiarity with L3, and the possibility that L3 in the ST is an invented language. © 2011 John Benjamins Publishing Company.","Audiovisual; Equivalence; Invented; Multilingualism; Pseudo-language; Secondary language; Third language; Transfer; Translation; Variation",,,,,,"Ministerio de Ciencia e InnovaciÃ³n, MICINN","1.

As opposed to Paul de Man's other writings, his work as a translator has received little scholarly attention. In this article I focus on De Man's translation activity in the context of the complex cultural-political situation in Belgium during World War II. I analyse the link between poetics and politics in his French translation of the Dutch novel De soldaat Johan by the Belgian author Filip de Pillecyn (1939).

The theoretical framework is eclectic but draws particularly on Delabastita (1996, 1997) and Lladó (2002). Empirical analysis is based on three English source texts and six Catalan translations, and focuses on two main issues: the frequency distribution of pairs of ST + TT segments across translation techniques, and the possible correlation(s) between translation techniques and factors influencing decision-making. It is observed that translators tend to use techniques implying a negative punning balance, i.e. resulting in some degree of loss of punning activity. Moreover, some factors identified in the literature are seen to correlate with the use of particular translation techniques. Finally, in the last section an attempt is made to go beyond description and explanation and to assess wordplay translation techniques in terms of their suitability as translation solutions. © John Benjamins Publishing Company.","English-Catalan; Factors; Literary translation; Punning balance; Techniques; Wordplay translation",,,,,,"Ministerio de Ciencia e InnovaciÃ³n, MICINN","* Research funds for this article have been provided by two research projects: FFI2009–09544, funded by the Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation, and P1·1B2008–59, funded by the Caixa Castelló — Bancaixa Foundation, within the framework of an agreement with the Uni-versitat Jaume I.","Swift, G., (1996) Last Orders, , London: Picador; Swift, G., (1999) Les Últimes Voluntats (translated by Carme Geronès and Carles Urritz), , Barcelona: Destino; Wilde, O., The picture of dorian gray (1966) Complete Works of Oscar Wilde, pp. 17-167. , (first published 1891), London and Glasgow: Collins; Wilde, O., (2000) El Retrat de Dorian Gray (translated by Rafael Tasis Marca), , (translation first published 1930), Barcelona: Ediciones B/Proa; Wilde, O., (1992) El Retrat de Dorian Gray (translated and adapted by Carolina Quílez Knowles), , Valencia: Tres i Quatre; Wilde, O., (1998) El Retrat de Dorian Gray (translated by Jordi Larios), , Barcelona: Quaderns Crema; Wilde, O., The importance of being earnest (1966) Complete Works of Oscar Wilde, pp. 321-384. , (first published 1895), London and Glasgow: Collins; Wilde, O., (1994) La importància d'ésser seriós (translated by Antoni V.

This paper will try to establish the existence of an institutionalized strategy of amplification, presumably born out of a wish to bridge the cultural gap reflected in two different national traditions of literary humor. The effect of amplification, as it is implemented in the various Hebrew translations of Charles Dickens's The Pickwick Papers and Jerome K. Jerome's Three Men in a Boat, is analyzed on the basis of Attardo's General Theory of Verbal Humor (Attardo 2001, 2002). The use of amplification as a model for the translation of humor from the beginning of the 20th century, and its diminishing currency from the 1980s onwards are also discussed. © John Benjamins Publishing Company.","Amplification; Attardo; British humor; Humor; Israeli humor; Translation",,,,,,,,"Antonini, R., The perception of subtitled humor in Italy (2005) Humor, 18 (2), pp. 209-225; Antonopoulou, E., A cognitive approach to literary humour devices: Translating raymond chandler (2002) The Translator, 8 (2), pp. 195-220; Asscher, O., (2008) The Influence of Stylistic Norms on the Hebrew Translation of British Humor, , Tel-Aviv: Tel-Aviv University.

This paper concerns itself with this constructivist narrative of the available historiographical discourse and the translational environment between 1851 and 1921 in Iran. After describing the field of translation in the period in question, I challenge the uncritical conception of translation as a positive force by, on the one hand, investigating hypothetical cultural and linguistic implications, and on the other hand, questioning the power of translation per se, as ascribed to it in the above mentioned historiographical discourse, in socio-cultural modernization. This will prioritize the individual and cultural translational effects over the supposed institutional ones. © John Benjamins Publishing Company.","Iranian modernity; Modern Persian prose; The Constitutional Revolution; The Darolfonun; Translation historiography; Translation movements",,,,,,,,"Ahmadzadeh, H., (2003) Nation and Novel: A Study of Persian and Kurdish Narrative Discourse, , Uppsala: Uppsala University Press; Aryanpour, Y., (2002) Az Saba ta Nima [From Saba to Nima], , First volume.

This process often results in a defamiliarisation of the new language through stylistic innovation, which, in turn, has implications for the translation of these texts. This article, influenced by Berman's 'analytique négative' (1985), proposes a series of guidelines for the translation of exophonic texts and illustrates these with examples taken from German exophonic prose texts by Franco Biondi, Emine Sevgi Özdamar and Yoko Tawada. © John Benjamins Publishing Company.","Emine Sevgi Özdamar; Exophony; Franco Biondi; Immigrant writing; Literary translation; Migrant writing; Post-war Germany; Stylistics; Yoko Tawada",,,,,,"Arts and Humanities Research Council, AHRC","I would like to acknowledge the assistance of the UK’s Arts and Humanities Research Council who funded this research.

To confirm whether this approach indeed benefits translators and translation quality, we designed and performed tests whereby trainee translators used the GTT to translate passages from English into Chinese either entirely from the source text, or after seeding of empty segments by the Google Translate engine as recommended. The translations were timed, and their quality assessed by independent experienced markers following Australian NAATI test criteria. Our results show that, while time differences were not significant, the machine translation seeded passages were more favourably assessed by the markers in thirty three of fifty six cases. This indicates that, at least for certain tasks and language combinations - and against the received wisdom of translation professionals and translator trainers - translating by proofreading machine translation may be advantageous. © John Benjamins Publishing Company.","Machine translation; Post-editing; Proofreading machine translation; Translation memory; Translation quality; Web-based translation",,,,,,,,"Allen, J., Post-editingx (2003) Computers and Translation: A Translator's Guide, pp. 297-317. , Harold Somers ed, Amsterdam-Philadelphia: John Benjamins; Bowker, L., Ehgoetz, M., Exploring user acceptance of machine translation output: A recipient evaluation (2007) Across Boundaries: International Perspectives on Translation, pp. 209-224. , Dorothy Kenny and Kyongjoo Ryou eds., Newcastle-upon-Tyne: Cambridge Scholars Publishing; Champollion, Y., Machine translation and the future of the translation industry (2001) Translation Journal, 5 (1); De Palma, Donald, A., Kelly, N., Translation of, for, and by the people (2008) Common Sense Advisory Report, , http://www.commonsenseadvisory.com/research/report-view.php?id= 97&cid=0#VisitedFebruary2010; Desilets, A., Gonzalez, L., Paquet, S., Stojanovic, M., (2006) Translation the Wiki Way, pp. 19-31. , WikiSym'06, August 21-23, Odense, Denmark; Dillinger, M., Gerber, L., Success with machine translation.

As repetition in translation has been hypothesized to be affected by certain universals of translation, the paper also offers initial data to support the universals of explicitation and avoiding repetition. Lexical repetitions are investigated using Hoey's (1991) theory in a corpus of Hungarian - English news texts. Analyses reveal considerable shifts in repetition in translations; however, these differences are not statistically significant. The corpus also provides evidence for repetition shifts affecting the macropropositional structure of target texts, leading to macropropositional shifts, which alter the global meaning of translations compared to sources. © John Benjamins Publishing Company.","Avoidance of repetition; Coherence; Cohesion; Explicitation; Macroproposition; Non-literary translation; Repetition; Shift; Text meaning; Translation universal",,,,,,,,"Abdulla, A.K., Rhetorical repetition in literary translation (2001) Babel, 47 (4), pp. 289-303; Al-Khafaji, R., Search of translational norms.

Firstly, I introduce the main features of the programme before moving on to present research on gay-related issues within Translation Studies. Drawing on Fairclough's approach to discourse, the next section discusses the concepts of 'schemata' and 'scripts', as used here, and relates them to the concept of identity. The evolution of the lexical items 'gay', 'homosexual', 'queer' and 'fag' is examined (Hughes 1991; Allan & Burridge 2006) before presenting data on the preferred choices in the original programme as well as in the Spanish version. Baker's strategies for word equivalence (1992) will be used to establish whether the use of negative terms such as 'marica' and 'maricón' aptly replace the source language term, 'gay'. The article concludes with a discussion of whether the dysphemic nature of the terms prevails and whether traditional schemata are maintained. © John Benjamins Publishing Company.","'fag'; 'gay'; 'homosexual'; 'marica'; 'queer'; Identity; Schemata; Scripts; Stereotypes",,,,,,,,"Baker, M., (1992) In Other Words, , London/New York: Routledge; Baker, M., (2006) Translation and Conflict.

Findings indicate that the book's essence embedded in a complex interweaving of Maori myths and biblical parallels has not been recognized by professional reviewers of the German translation and that certain mistranslations distort important messages from the original. All readers of translations potentially contribute to indigenous people regaining their voice, but only if these readers can decipher the original actions and discourses in their languages. This article delivers a key to understanding Potiki, a classic text widely used in teaching and already translated into at least five languages, i.e. Dutch, Finnish, French, German and Spanish. © John Benjamins Publishing Company.","Cultural tools; Maori culture; Mediated action; Mediated Discourse Analysis; Postcolonial",,,,,,,,"Alpers, A., (1996) Maori myths and tribal legends, , 2nd edition, Auckland: Longman; Bhabha, H.K., (1994) The location of culture, , New York: Routledge; Batchelor, J., (1989) Into the time of remembering: A study of Patircia Grace's Potiki, , Dissertation, MA English.

Moreover, translation always involves a process of identifying the different components of the texts in order to establish a hierarchy of relevance of those elements (see Toury 1980:38). The priority given to some elements to the detriment of others will have a decisive influence on the choice of certain strategies and the final outcome. The literary use of a dialect in literary texts seems to be a particularly good example of that balancing of meaning and prioritization of elements. Not only because of its very localised meaning (both in time and space), but also because it is always embedded in the source text with a communicative and semiotic significance. It can challenge the translator who, when faced with the impossibility of looking for referential equivalences and formal correspondences, is forced to decide on the importance and meaning of the use of a specific dialect in the text. That decision will define the strategies to be used, which can go from total normalization of the text to a recreation of a linguistic variety in the target text. The purpose of this article is threefold: To present for discussion a model summarising the strategies identified in a number of case-studies; to present and discuss the strategies identified in a corpus of 12 Portuguese translations of Bernard Shaw's Pygmalion and Alan Jay Lerner's My Fair Lady, as well as the contextual factors which might have influenced the translators' choices; and to establish whether there are regularities in the associations between media (translation for stage, page and screen) and strategies for dealing with non-standard language. © John Benjamins Publishing Company.","Linguistic variation; Normalization; Page translation; Screen translation; Stage translation",,,,,,,,"Ben-Shahar, R., Translating Literary Dialogue: A problem and its implications for translation into Hebrew (1994) Target, 6 (2), pp. 195-221; Blake, N.

The novel was quite well received in France and it was translated into English twice the following year, first by Joseph Trapp and then by an anonymous translator. My article is based on a comparative analysis of some key passages containing abolitionist discourse in the source text and in the two target texts. I argue that the second English translator systematically made the novel more suitable for the abolitionist cause, by omitting or by modifying contradictory material found in the source text.

This proposition is particularly evident in the case of classics: When translators have to work on literary creations occupying a pivotal position in the source/target cultures, they adopt strategies of literalness and ennoblement which betray a quasi-religious awe - on the one hand, a desire to ruffle the surface of the revered original as little as possible; and on the other, a determination to reproduce the supposed 'classical qualities' of the classic even when they are not present in the source. In the following article, I examine how the 'idea of classic' influences translation theory and practice, substantiating my theoretical observations by looking at Italian translations of English classics. A marked - and historically determined - disparity between source and target readerships, and the translators' reverence for their prestigious originals, conspire to produce Italian versions which are much more 'wooden' and 'elegant' than their English counterparts. © John Benjamins Publishing Company.","Comparative literature; Descriptive translation studies; History of reading; Literary classics; Religious literature; Translation norms",,,,,,,,"Altick, R.D., (1957) The English Common Reader.

They differ not only in how they address their subject matter but also in that they occupy different ""niches"" in the culture. In the terminology of Bourdieu, they partake in differ- ent, though possibly partly overlapping cultural fields. This article attempts to create a meeting place for two representatives of these disciplines: Paul Ricœur, a leading figure in French hermeneutics of the 20th century, and Gideon Toury, a prominent researcher in the field of translation studies. Ricœur's concept of the (non-existing) ""third text"" is compared with Toury's concept of ""the adequate translation as a hypothetical construct"", which was proposed in the 1980s and negated in the 1990s; and Ricœur's view of translation as ""equivalence with- out adequacy"" is compared with Toury's stand on this issue. The possibility of working with both and reading each of them in light of the other is examined by applying their ideas to a test case - three Hebrew translations of Kipling's ""If"". The underlying assumption is that establishing links between translation studies and the philosophy of translation can contribute to the understanding of the phenomenon, which is the subject matter of both. © John Benjamins Publishing Company.","""Third text""; Adequacy; Equivalence; Philosophy of translation; Translation studies",,,,,,,,"Kipling, R., (1976) A Choice of Kipling's Verse, pp. 273-274. , 1892, ""If"".

Particularly interesting examples, both quantitively and qualitively, can be found in French literature, notably in the fiction of Marguerite Duras, who made asyndeton her hallmark. This study documents the choices made by English translators of Duras, and of three other French writers who exploit asyndeton. Literature aside, asyndeton in French texts is not carried over into English, in what can be qualified as norm-governed translation. However, asyndeton in literary texts is carried over into English in up to fifty percent of cases, reflecting a certain compromise between norms in the source language and those in the target language. Apart from describing Duras' specific use of asyndeton, and illustrating the difficulty of translating any element that is an essential ingredient of a writer's style, which, by definition, represents a departure from an accepted norm, this study brings to light certain aspects governing clause combining in English. Certain linguistic parameters that favour the exploitation of asyndeton in English are systematised, specifically concision, rhythm and isotopy. Semantic, temporal and/or aspectual constraints are also highlighted. © John Benjamins Publishing Company.","Asyndeton; French-English translation; Literary translation; Marguerite Duras; Style",,,,,,,,"Baker, M., (1992) In other words: A Coursebook on Translation, , London, New York: Routledge; Costermans, J., Fayol, M., (1997) Processing Interclausal Relationships: Studies in the Production and Comprehension of Text, , New Jersey: Lawrence Erlbaum; Cruttenden, A., (1997) Intonation, , Cambridge: CUP; Cuddin, J.A., (1976) A Dictionary of Literary Terms and Literary Theory, , Oxford: Blackwell; Demanuelli, C., (1987) Points de repère, approche interlinguistique de la ponctuation français-an-glais, , Saint-Etienne: CIEREC; Downing, A., Locke, P., (1995) A University Course in English Grammar, , London: Prentice Hall; Chuquet, H., (1990) Pratique de la Traduction, , Paris: Ophrys; Greimas, A.-J., (1966) Sémantique structurale, , Paris: Larousse; Grellet, F., (1990) Apprendre à traduire, typologie d'exercices de traduction, , Nancy: Presses universitaires; Elbow, P., (2000) Everyone can write, , Oxford: Oxford University Press; Fayol, M., On Aquiring and Using Punctuation: A Study of Written French (1997) Processing Interclausal Relationships: Studies in the Production and Comprehension of Text, pp. 157-178. , J.

It mentions the theoretical and methodological underpinnings of Popovič's work (particularly Jiří Levý and František Miko), briefly analyzes Popovič's most important publications within the field of translation studies, and discusses criticisms as well as inspirations of his conception of translation. The paper concludes with an evaluation of Popovič's role in developing the field of Czechoslovak and international translation studies, most importantly of descriptive translation studies and the manipulation school. © John Benjamins Publishing Company.","Anton Popovič; Descriptive translation studies; František Miko; Jiří Levý; Manipulation school; Metacommunication; Metatext; Shifts of expression",,,,,,,,"Popovič, A., Ruská literatúra na Slovensku v rokoch 1863-1875 (1961) Russian Literature in Slovakia in the years 1863-1875, , Bratislava: VSAV; Popovič, A., Preklad a výraz (1968) Translation and Expression, , Bratislava: VSAV; Popovič, A., Štrukturalizmus v slovenskej vede (1931-1949): Dejiny, texty, bibliografia (1970) Structuralism in Slovak Science from 1931 to 1949: History, Texts, Bibliography, , Martin: Matica slovenská; Popovič, A., Poetika umeleckého prekladu.

The translations, by Hans-Christian Oeser and Renate Orth-Guttmann, were both published in 1998. The study isolates the linguistic feature of modal particles in which the individual styles of the translators manifest themselves on the textual level and investigates the influence the translators' microlevel linguistic choices have on the macrolevel of the novel. An electronic corpus was compiled, comprising The Beautiful and Damned and its two translations, both entitled Die Schönen und Verdammten. A quantitative analysis was carried out to discover potential patterns of the use of modal particles by the translators, and the results showed that while both translators use modal particles to the extent and in the general context one would expect, they differ considerably in their choice and use of individual modal particles. The subsequent qualitative analysis takes a pragmatic approach, and discusses the selected modal particle wohl according to its communicative function, its role in speech and thought acts and in the narrative, and in the context of the respective narrative points of view. Finally it is argued that the two translators differ in their translation styles to an extent that affects the novel's macrolevel in that one translator provides a character study while the other focuses on societal issues. © John Benjamins Publishing Company.","Corpus methodologies; F.

It starts by examining the Polish linguistic image of translating, followed by a survey of metaphorical descriptions of the translator and translation from the 18th century, representing the pre-scientific era in reflection on translation. Most attention is devoted to metaphors found in contemporary Polish discourse on translation, centered around: (1) the nature of translation; (2) the relationship between the source and target text, and between the author and translator; and (3) the role of the translator. It is demonstrated that the Polish context offers a rich repertoire of metaphorical depictions of translating, which reflects itsdistinctive historical and cultural setup. © John Benjamins Publishing Company.","Imagery; Metaphor; Poland; Polish; Translating; Translation; Translator",,,,,,,,"Bańkowski, A., (2000) Etymologiczny słownik je{ogonek}zyka polskiego, , Warszawa: Polskie Wydawnictwo Naukowe; Linde, S.B., (1859) Słownik je{ogonek}zyka polskiego, , Lwów: Ossolineum; (2003) Słownik polszczyzny XVI wieku, , Mayenowa, Maria Renata, ed, Warszawa: Polska Akademia Nauk; Słownik je{ogonek}zyka polskiego (in 11 volumes), , Doroszewski, Witold, ed., Warszawa: Pol; (1978) Słownik je{ogonek}zyka polskiego (in 3 volumes), , Szymczak, Mieczysław, ed, Warszawa: Polskie Wydawnictwo Naukowe; (1982) Słownik staropolski, , Urbańczyk, Stanisław, ed, Wrocław et. al.: Polskie Wydawnictwo Naukowe; (1999) Słownik współczesnego je{ogonek}zyka polskiego, , Dunaj, Bogusław, ed, Warszawa: Wilga; (2006) Uniwersalny słownik je{ogonek}zyka polskiego PWN, , Dubisz, Stanisław, ed, Warszawa: Polskie Wydawnictwo Naukowe; Karłowicz, J., Kryński, A., Niedźwiedzki, W., (1912) Słownik je{ogonek}zyka polskiego, , Warszawa: Kasa im.

It employs analytical tools from cross-cultural pragmatics to describe speech act behaviour in the original and its translations. Lin uses more translation shifts - including significant shifts in strategy use, and moderate shifts in information sequencing - than Pratt & Chiang, who mainly retain the original pragmatic features. Both the translators and the original author make frequent use of request formulae. The two translations also show marked shifts from lexical to syntactic modification of requests. The article further examines the translators' approaches to translation in terms of their concept of translation and the historical and social contexts of their translations. © John Benjamins Publishing Company.","Chinese literature; Cross-cultural pragmatics; Formulaic language; Request; Translation norm; Translation shift",,,,,,,,"Abdel-Hafiz, A.-S., Pragmatic and linguistic problems in the translation of Naguib Mahfouz's The Thief and the Dogs: A case study (2003) Babel, 49 (3), pp. 229-252; Achiba, Machiko. 2003.

A set of different scientometric, network analytical and text linguistic (keyword analysis, title word analysis, co-occurrence analysis) methodological tools is used to investigate this specific field of research. The paper is a follow-up to a first brief introductory paper on that topic (Grbić and Pöllabauer 2006a) and presents an in-depth analysis of the subject. The corpus of the study includes 595 publications on research into spoken and signed CI in German-speaking countries, which were published between 1979 and 2006. It was compiled on the basis of a comprehensive search of the literature. The study focuses, among other aspects, on the types of documents published in that field of research (with a specific focus on journal articles, collective volumes, papers in collective volumes, graduation and doctoral theses) and the nature of the publications, the overall growth rates of publications on that field, the most common languages of publication, the disciplinary affiliation of the authors, the agents (people, institutions) involved in researching CI as well as the networks of authors and co-authorships, and the topics touched upon in research on CI and the most common co-occurrences of topics. © John Benjamins Publishing Company.","Community interpreting; Scientometrics; Sign language interpreting",,,,,,,,"Bahadir, S., Von natürlichen Kommunikationskrücken zu professionellen Kommunikationsbrücken (Reflexionen zum Berufsprofil und zur Ausbildung professioneller Dolmetscher im medizinischen, sozialen und juristischen Bereich) (2000) TEXTconTEXT 14 = NF4, pp. 211-229; Batagelj, Vladimir and Andrej Mrvar. 2006.

The English suffix -ly has been traditionally associated with the expression of manner. However, it also actualises other meanings, in particular degree. In Spanish, the formal equivalents of -ly adverbs are adverbs ending in -mente, but the latter occur less frequently and with different pragmatic nuances. Adverbs of degree can be translated into -mente adverbs but also into other resources such as non -mente adverbs, prepositional phrases, adjectives, etc. The aim is to establish a taxonomy of translation solutions extracted from a parallel corpus in order to reveal cross-linguistic correspondences useful in translator training and translation quality assessment. © John Benjamins Publishing Company.","-ly suffix; -mente suffix; Adverbs of degree; Parallel corpus; Translation; Translation quality assessment",,,,,,"HUM2005– 01215

My interest is in concepts, theories and methods in academia, and the fact that these memes have more or less difficulty in spreading. They encounter more or less resistance in jumping boundaries, whether those boundaries are disciplinary or boundaries constituted by national research traditions.

The findings are based on a stylistic comparison of the Finnish, French and Russian subtitled versions of 8 Mile, a film that tells about Eminem's early breakthrough as a rap artist (UIP, 2002). The rap sections of the film present many 'text-specific translation problems' (Nord), which become even more troublesome in the context of subtitling, as the translator has space for less text. The worldwide subtitling and dubbing of 8 Mile was an especially well-supervised procedure. The translators were given a lot of material support (e.g., a detailed 'dialogue list') but their work was also strictly controlled and limited. According to this study, the severe policy of some local UIP offices may have hindered the quality of subtitling in some countries. © John Benjamins Publishing Company.","8 Mile; Dialogue list; Film subtitling; Quality control in subtitling; Translation of rap; Translation problem",,,,,,"Suomen Kulttuurirahasto, SKR

In France, Hilary Davies, who gave me Marc Girard- Ygor’s contact information; Marc Girard-Ygor, who was very helpful; and Josselin Vasseur, who was always ready to help. In Russia, Andrey Shilov, who helped and encouraged me and Dimitri Usachov, who was very friendly and sent to me a part of his rhymed translation of the rap parts that UIP refused.

'Ambiguity', here understood as something that allows for more than one interpretation, is supposed to be critical in translation for children as it clashes with some mediators' ideas of what children's literature is or ought to be. Hans Christian Andersen's tale of ""Den standhaftige Tinsoldat"" ['The steadfast tin soldier'] and a sample of twenty-four translations thereof (twelve into Swedish and twelve into Spanish) are used to explore different ways that ambiguity is translated for children. The objective is to determine if and how the tale's ambiguities are manipulated in the various translations, and thus to initiate a theoretical discussion of ambiguity in translation for children. A difference is established between 'textually resolvable' and 'textually irresolvable' ambiguities and these two kinds of ambiguity are found to be treated differently in the analyzed sample of translations. © John Benjamins Publishing Company.","Ambiguity; Children's literature; Hans Christian Andersen; Literary translation",,,,,,,,"Alvstad, C., (2005) La traducción como mediación editorial: Un estudio de 150 libros para niños y jóvenes publicados en Argentina durante 1997, , Göteborg: Acta Universitatis Gothoburgensis; Alvstad, C., Translational analysis and the dynamics of reading (2007) Doubts and directions in Translation Studies: Selected contributions from the EST congress Lisbon 2004, pp. 127-135. , Yves Gambier, Miriam Shlesinger and Radegundis Stolze, eds, Amsterdam-Philadelphia: John Benjamins; Bettelheim, B., (1976) The uses of enchantment: The meaning and importance of fairy tales, , New York: Alfred A.

Of the few who have taken up the topic, Immanuel Wallerstein has argued that one of the distinguishing characteristics of social scientific texts is that they traffic in concepts. Wallerstein wants the translation of social science to further the possibility of a universal conversation in the social sciences. I argue that a universal conversation in the social sciences is neither possible nor desirable. Instead, this article proposes that translating social science can contribute to conceptual clarification and elaboration. In this way, the translation may complement and further the flowering of the 'original' concept.

Devised by the present author, who is also responsible for the translations analyzed, the CIS is a translational scheme whereby meaning is understood as an inexhaustible textual effect, and which, in its theoretical elucidation, seeks to raise the practicing translator's awareness of the control he or she might have over the degree of infinite exegetic circumscription - and subsequent infinite exegetic recreation - during the translation process. © John Benjamins Publishing Company.","Circumscription; Culture; Deconstruction; Exegesis meaning; Infinity; Poetry; Tropes",,,,,,,,"Borges, J.L., (1989) Obras completas, , Buenos Aires: Emecé; Davis, K., (2001) Deconstruction and translation, , Manchester: St Jerome; Derrida, Jacques. 1967a/1974.

The linguistic theories of the 1950s and 1960s were too normative and a-contextual to account for all the forms and aspects of translation; while the 'skeptical turn' of Translation Studies has succeeded in unmasking the ideological quality of all theories, but cannot produce a 'cybernetics' of translation, an account of how translation is materially done. A. new linguistic approach can produce such a practical account, provided that the pragmatic level of analysis is given a prominent role and that a touch of non-scientific skepticism is maintained. © John Benjamins Publishing Company.","Cooperation; Deixis; Linguistics; Politeness; Pragmatics; Text acts; Translation practice; Translation theory",,,,,,,,"Ariosto, Ludovico. 1584.

Based on the cognitive theory of metaphor (Lakoff and Johnson 1980, 1999; Lakoff 1987; Johnson 1987; Lakoff 1993), the analysis led to the identification of two conceptual metaphors that played a crucial role in the articulation of German functionalism: the TRANSFER metaphor and the TARGET metaphor. The paper focuses on the main implications of the use of these metaphors and on the contradictions they create. A broadening of the functionalist theoretical framework is then proposed with the goal of overcoming these contradictions. © John Benjamins Publishing Company.","Cognition; Functionalism; Metaphor; Model; Theory; Translation",,,,,,,,"Baldauf, Christa. 1997.

We will focus on Salim al-Dawudi's translation of the first Hebrew novel, Avraham Mapu's Ahavat Tsiyon [The love of Zion] (1853), one of the most important texts to advocate the renewal of ties between Jews and Palestine. Al-Dawudi's translation was published in Egypt in two non-identical editions in 1899 and 1921-1922, and is probably the first Arabic translation of Modern Hebrew literature. When he declared that his translation was designed to remind his people that Hebrew was a living language, al-Dawudi accorded his translation Jewish national aspirations, which is perhaps the reason for the mixed aims of his translation's policy. On the one hand, there are phenomena that illustrate his desire to be accepted in the target culture, such as neglect of the integrity of the text, raising its stylistic register, preserving the ethical norms of the source text and even a tendency to paraphrase. On the other hand, there are places that display over-consideration of the source language and text, such as numerous deviations from the standard linguistic, syntactical and grammatical rules of Arabic, preservation of elements unique to Jewish culture and a multitude of Hebrew interferences in the Arabic translation. This unsystematic behavior apparently reflects a lack of literary skills, deep admiration of the source text (and language), and the fact that the translation was addressed mainly to a Jewish audience. © John Benjamins Publishing Company.","Arabic writing by Jews; Cultural hegemony; Hebrew-Arabic translations; Jews in Arab countries; Literature of the Jewish Enlightenment; Revival of Hebrew; Translational norms",,,,,,,,"Abitbul, M., Tahlikhe modernizatsyah ve-ha-hitpatkhut ba-'et ha-khadišah [Modernization processes and progression in the Modern Era] (1986) Etinger 1986. 361-465, , Hebrew; Alf laylah, (1999) Alf laylah wa-laylah, , Arabian nights, Beirut: Dār Sādir, Arabic; Allen, R., (1982) The Arabic novel: An historical and critical introduction, , Syracuse, N.Y, Syracuse University Press; 'Allush, Sa'id. 1987.

The present study, however, tests and compares the awareness of these evaluative features in the behaviour of soonto- be translators and first year LSP English students when using their foreign language. © John Benjamins Publishing Company.","Connotation; Corpus analysis; Equivalence; Extended lexical units; Semantic preference; Semantic profiles; Semantic prosody; Synonymy; Translator awareness",,,,,,,,"Berber Sardinha, T., Semantic prosodies in English and Portuguese: A contrastive study (2000) Cuadernos de Filología Inglesa, 9 (1), pp. 93-110. , http://www2.lael.pucsp.br/~tony/temp/publications/2000murcia_prosodies.pdf, available online at; http://www.natcorp.ox.ac.uk, British National Corpus, available online at; Cruse, D.A., (1986) Lexical semantics, , Cambridge: Cambridge University Press; Dam-Jensen, H., Korning Zethsen, K., Pragmatic patterns and the lexical system: A reassessment of evaluation in language (2007) Journal of pragmatics, 39 (9), pp. 1608-1623; Firth, J.R., A synopsis of linguistic theory, 1930-1955 (1957) Studies in linguistic analysis, special volume, Philosophical Society, pp. 1-32. , Oxford: Blackwell; Hunston, S., (2002) Corpora in applied linguistics, , Cambridge: Cambridge University Press; Hunston, S., Thompson, G., (2000) Evaluation in text: Authorial stance and the construction of discourse, , Oxford: Oxford University Press; Jakobson, R., On linguistic aspects of translation (1959) The Translation Studies reader, pp. 113-118. , Lawrence Venuti, ed, London and New York: Routledge, 2000; Louw, B., Irony in the text or insincerity in the writer?: The diagnostic potential of semantic prosodies (1993) Text and technology, pp. 157-176. , Mona Baker, Gill Francis and Elena Tognini-Bonelli, eds, Amsterdam: John Benjamins; Lyons, J., (1981) Language and linguistics: An introduction, , Cambridge: Cambridge University Press; Munday, Jeremy. 2003.

The phenomenon is approached as a conceptual challenge subsumed under the question Can the identity of a literary work of art be retained when the work is translated)? Since the question of translatability as posed here belongs to the realm of philosophy of art, the problematic nature of 'original', 'translation and 'identity' is discussed first in the theoretical context of analytic philosophy. I then consider the issue within the framework of Translation Studies. By showing the definitional diversity the necessity of contextual embedding and theoretical explicitness is highlighted.

Even the name of the discipline has been an issue since James Holmes brought it up in 1972, and the central concept of the time, equivalence, despite incessant debate and revaluation in some schools of thought, has in others long since been discarded as an illusion. Basically there are three possibilities open to the scholar wanting to introduce a new technical term: - As in the case of norm (Toury), a word from generai language can be used in a specified sense and defined as such. The danger arises that it can be misinter-preted and used differently in other languages (as with Vermeer's Norm). - the invention of completely new terms, as with Justa Holz-Mänttäri's Botschaftsträger. - A word is taken over from a classical dead language, such as Latin or Greek, and given a specific definition for the theory concerned, as was the case with skopos in the functionalist approach. Referring to experience in editing the Handbuch Translation, the essay discusses this issue in detail. It also deals with the use of English as a lingua franca in the metadiscourse of Translation Studies. © John Benjamins Publishing Company.","Compatible discourse; Convention; Culture; False friends; Functional approach; Norm; Plurality of approaches; Skopos",,,,,,,,"Carroll, L., (1872) Through the looking glass, , London: Penguin; Clyne, M., Zu kulturellen Unterschieden in der Produktion und Wahrnehmung englischer und deutscher wissenschaftlicher Texte (1991) Info DaF, 18 (4), pp. 376-383; Coseriu, E., System, Norm und Rede (1970) Sprachen, Strukturen und Funktionen, pp. 193-212. , Eugenio Coseriu, ed, Tübingen: Gunter Narr; Finkenstaedt, T., Schröder, K., (1992) Sprachen im Europa von morgen, , Berlin/München: Langenscheidt; Halverson, S., The concept of equivalence in Translation Studies: Much ado about something (1997) Target, 9 (2), pp. 207-233; Holmes, James S. 1987 [11972].

Qualitative analysis of the Spanish native texts provided a linguistic profile for the verb. This profile was then used in a contextual study to assess the appropriateness of the 360 instances found in the translated texts. The results indicate that observar is only a natural translation equivalent for 'observe'. For other verbs, an awareness both of the rhetorical, syntactic and collocational restrictions and of the range of alternative choices will allow translators to select appropriate lexical items and avoid excessive repetition of observar, thus creating a more varied target text. © John Benjamins Publishing Company.",,,,,,,,,"Baker, M., Corpora in Translation Studies: An overview and some suggestions for future research (1995) Target, 7 (2), pp. 223-243; Baker, Mona. 1996.

This paper pools techniques commonly used in loanword phonology and second language acquisition to illustrate complications that arise when translating names from English into languages such as Japanese and Chinese, which differ significantly from the source language in syllable structure and orthographic convention. Competing strategies of adaptation and accommodation are placed in the context of lexical retrieval and compared with experimental studies of nativization in interlanguage. It will be shown that for names to be perceived as similar-sounding across language boundaries, it would be desirable to look beyond segmentai equivalence and consider stress, syllable count and other suprasegmental factors that play a greater role in phonological memory. © John Benjamins Publishing Company.","Accommodation; Adaptation; Nativization; Phonological translation; Transliteration",,,,,,,,"Abrahamsson, N., Acquiring L2 syllable margins - Studies on the simplification of onsets and codas in interlanguage phonology (2001), Stockholm University, Ph.D. dissertation; Abrahamsson, N., Development and recoverability of L2 codas: A longitudinal study of Chinese/Swedish interphonology (2003) Studies in second language acquisition, 25 (3), pp. 313-349; Aitchison, J., (1987) Words in the mind: An introduction to the mental lexicon, , third edition.

At the same time a multitude of definitions, especially if competing with each other, is quite often perceived as a typical symptom of fields of research that have not yet developed their theories to the necessary level of sophistication. A relatively young field of research, Translation Studies and its proponents have repeatedly been the target of criticism in that respect, i.e. working with concepts whose définitions do not comply with commonly accepted standards of définition. That kind of critique serves as the starting point for this paper, which tries to analyze définitions in two séminal publications in the history of German Übersetzungswissenschaft, representing two opposing approaches to translation, namely Zufall und Gesetzmäßigkeit in der Übersetzungby Otto Kade (1968) and Grundlegung einer allgemeinen Translationstheorie by Hans J. Vermeer and Katharina Reiß (1984). The paper gives an account of standards of definition, commonly found in philosophy of science and terminology, addresses central aspects of scientific concepts (theory-boundness, types of concepts, determinacy, vagueness) and présents the findings of a study focusing on defining patterns. © John Benjamins Publishing Company.","Definition theory; Definitional patterns; Definitional practice in TS; Otto Kade; Reiß/Vermeer",,,,,,,,"Albert, S., (2001) Übersetzung und Philosophie: Wissenschaftsphilosophische Probleme der Übersetzungstheorie - Die Fragen der Übersetzung von philosophischen Texten, , Wien: Ed.

It has developed a language of its own, which, however, still seems to be little known among translation scholars. What is more, being primarily an industry-based discourse, the terms related to localization are very fluid, which makes theorizing about it difficult. Therefore, the aim of this article is, first of all, to explain the basic terms of the metalanguage of localization, as they are used by both localization practitioners and scholars, and, secondly, to make this metalanguage more consistent by proposing some general definitions that cover the basic concepts in localization. This, in turn, should, on the one hand, facilitate scholar-to-practitioner communication and vice versa and, on the other, should result in concept standardization for training purposes. In the conclusions I link the present discussion of the metalanguage of localization to a more general debate on metalanguage(s) in Translation Studies and propose that in the future we might witness the emergence of a new discipline called Localization Studies. © John Benjamins Publishing Company.","Globalization; Glocalization; Internationalization; Localization; Text distribution; Translation",,,,,,,,"Appadurai, A., Disjuncture and difference in the global cultural economy (1990) Global culture: Nationalism, globalization and modernity, pp. 295-310. , Mike Featherstone, ed, London: Sage; Cadieux, P., Esselink, B., GILT: Globalization, internationalization, localization, translation (2004) Globalization insider, pp. 1-5. , www.lisa.org, XI:1:5; Chesterman, A., Problems with strategies (2005) New trends in Translation Studies: In honour of Kinga Klaudy, pp. 17-28. , Kristina Károly and Ágota Fóris, eds, Budapest: Akadémiai Kiadó; Chesterman, A., Dam, H.V., Engberg, J., Schjoldager, A., Bananas - on names and definitions in Translation Studies (2003) Hermes, 31, pp. 197-209; Cronin, M., (2003) Translation and globalization, , London: Routledge; Derrida, J., (1972) La Dissémination, , Paris: Éditions de Minuit; Esselink, B., (1998) A practical guide to software localization, , Amsterdam and Philadalphia: John Benjamins; Esselink, Bert. 2003.

This has left translation research relatively impoverished in the theoretical grounding of research methodology. While the performance speed of interpreting seems to make interpreting research closer to bilingual speech research, the shared features of interpreting and translation suggest that they are points on a continuum rather than discrete production modes. A Translation-Interpreting Continuum is proposed, which allows various production modes to be described in terms of psycholinguistic notions, and which includes a language development dimension to account for second language production. The Continuum allows some very basic questions about translation research methodology to be answered, and opens up the opportunity for a better integration of translation and interpreting research. © John Benjamins Publishing Company.","Interpreting; Language acquisition; Psycholinguistics; Research methodology; Translation",,,,,,,,"(2005) In and out of English: For better, for worse, , Anderman, Gunilla M. and Margaret Rogers, eds, Buffalo: Multilingual Matters; Beattie, G., (1983) Talk: An analysis of speech and non-verbal behaviour in conversation, , Milton Keynes: Open University Press; Campbell, S., (1998) Translation into the second language, , London: Longman; Campbell, S., Critical structures in the evaluation of translations from Arabic into English as a second language (2000) The translator, pp. 211-229. , 6:2; Chafe, W.L., Discourse structure and human knowledge (1972) Language comprehension and the acquisition of knowledge, pp. 41-69. , Roy O.

Firstly, the weak epistemological status of Translation Studies as a discipline does not favour consensus among specialists. Secondly, conceptual difficulties arise from the fact that the relationship between concepts and terms is far from univocal: conceptual similarities are clouded by terminological differences, and conceptual differences lurk beneath apparent synonymy. Thirdly, both conceptual and terminological practices are often rooted in different national traditions and may be school-specific. These three sets of problems are interrelated, and they are shown at work in a concept that has often been referred to as technique or shift. They have not only inward - academic and theoretical - but also outward - social and professional - consequences, as the social projection of professional translators vis-à-vis other professions may depend to a certain extent on their ability to use an acknowledged terminology. The same may be true of the translation scholar community. © John Benjamins Publishing Company.","Conceptual; Epistemological; Intercultural; Shift; Strategy; Technique",,,,,,,,"Catford, J.C., (1965) A linguistic theory of translation, , Oxford: Oxford University Press; Chesterman, A., Problems with strategies (2005) New trends in Translation Studies: In honour of Kinga Klaudy, pp. 17-28. , Kristina Károly and Ágosta Fóris, eds, Budapest: Akadémiai Kiadó; Chesterman, Andrew. 2006.

A similar desire for univocal terms can also be detected in the claims for the need of one, universally accepted term for the same phenomenon where various competing terms already exist and are in use. Although some linguists have already expressed their doubts in the justification of some of the fundamental linguistic concepts, as Rajogopalan has observed, a lot of them are still happy working with such discreet entities thus making linguistics perhaps the most ""19th century"" of the academic disciplines taught in universities today. Unfortunately, this could also be stated for some currents in Translation Studies, despite the fact that translation research can and should provide the most suitable field where such axiomatic truths are challenged. The article questions this desire for the univocal and argues that it is high time we all learn to live with more fuzzy definitions. © John Benjamins Publishing Company.","Acceptable term; Fuzziness; Mother tongue; Native speaker; Univocality",,,,,,,,"Beeby, A.L., (1996) Teaching translation from Spanish to English: Worlds beyond Words, , Ottawa: University of Ottawa; Birdsong, D., Ultimate attainment in second language acquisition (1992) Language, 68, pp. 706-755; Bloomfield, L., Literate and illiterate speech (1927) American speech, 2, pp. 232-239; also in A Leonard Bloomfield anthology, ed.

Close inspection reveals that some theories assume pre-existing equivalents and are thus concerned with a search for ""natural"" equivalence. Other theories allow that translators actively create equivalents, and are thus concerned with ""directional"" equivalence. The first kind of equivalence is concerned with what languages ideally do prior to translation; the other deals with what they can do. These two approaches are often intertwined, giving rise to many misunderstandings and unfair criticisms of the underlying concept. The historical undoing of the equivalence paradigm came when the directional use of the term allowed that equivalence need be no more a belief or expectation at the moment of reception, which need not be substantiated on the level of linguistic forms. At the same time, source texts became less stable and languages have been returning to more visibly hierarchical relations, further undermining the concept. Contemporary localization projects may nevertheless fruitfully be interrogated from the perspective of natural and directional équivalence, since the presumptions are being used by contemporary technology precisely at the moment when the terms themselves have been dropped from critical and exploratory metalanguage. © John Benjamins Publishing Company.","Directional equivalence; Lexical semantics; Localization; Natural equivalence; Relevance theory; Translation strategies; Types of equivalence",,,,,,,,"Burge, T., Self-reference and translation (1978) Meaning and translation: Philosophical and linguistic approaches, pp. 137-153. , F.

A comparison is made with my earlier projects on professional translators and translation students and pedagogical implications are also drawn in relation to some of the focal issues in translator training. © John Benjamins Publishing Company.","Administrators of translation services; Chinese; Hong Kong; Qualitative method; Quantitative method; Social needs; Translator training",,,,,,,,"Bogdan, R., Knopp Biklen, S., (1992) Qualitative research for education: An introduction to theory and methods, , London: Allyn and Bacon; Cao, D., On translational language competence (1996) Babel, 42 (4), pp. 231-238; Officiai Languages Officer, Simultaneous Interpreter and Calligraphist Grades, , http://www.csb.gov.hk/english/grade/ol/1475.html, Civil Service Bureau, Grade Structure and Establishment, Retrieved on Nov 25, 2005; Delisle, J., (1980) L'Analyse du discours comme méthode de traduction, , Ottawa: Éditions de l'université d'Ottawa; Delisle, J., (1981) L'Enseignement de l'interprétation et de la traduction, , Ottawa: Éditions de l'université d'Ottawa; Durban, C., Martin, T., Mossop, B., Schwartz, R., Searls-Ridge, C., Translator training & the real world: Concrete suggestions for bridging the gap (2003) Translation journal, 7 -1, pp. 1-35; Friedberg, M., (1997) Literary translation in Russia: A cultural history, , Pennsylvania: The Pennsylvania State University Press; Gémar, J.-C., De la pratique à la théorie, l'apport des praticiens à la théorie générale de la traduction (1983) Meta, 28 (4), pp. 323-333; Gile, D., (1995) Basic concepts and models for interpreter and translator training, , Amsterdam-Philadelphia: John Benjamins; Goetz, J.P., LeCompte, M.D., (1984) Ethnography and qualitative design in educational research, , Orlando: Academic Press; Juhel, D., La Place de la Réflexion Théorique dans l'enseignement de la Traduction (1985) Meta, 30 (3), pp. 292-295; Lang, M., The problem of mother tongue competence in the training of translators (1992) Translation Studies: An interdiscipline, pp. 395-400. , Mary Snell-Hornby, Franz Pöchhacker and Klaus Kaindl, eds, Amsterdam-Philadelphia: John Benjamins; Larose, R., La théorie de la traduction: À quoi ça sert?

The article focuses on one aspect of translation practice, namely translatorial ethos. It is argued that the forms of translatorial ethos visible in the data are complex in that they have a bearing both on textual and institutional practice and relations at one and the same time. More specifically, it is also argued that these complex professional stances and positionings need to be taken into account if we are to gain a better understanding of translational norms (Toury 1995, 2000 and Chesterman 1993) or translational habitus (Simeoni 1998). Furthermore, it is argued in a more generai sense that linguistic ethnography can provide clear indications of patterns of translational practice and therefore forms a useful means of inquiry in the context of translation studies. © John Benjamins Publishing Company.","Habitus; Linguistic ethnography; Positioning; Translation practice; Translational norms",,,,,,,,"(1999) Postcolonial translation: Theory andpractice, , Bassnett, Susan and Harish Trivedi, eds, London & New York: Routledge; Bourdieu, P., (1980) Le sens pratique, , Paris: Les éditions de minuit; Chesterman, A., From 'is' to bught': Translation laws, norms and stratégies (1993) Target, 5 (1), pp. 1-20; Cronin, Michael. 2002.

It is often referred to but only very few attempts have been made to complement it, let alone to draw completely new maps of the discipline, especially after the simplicity of relationships suggested by maps was severely denounced by Anthony Pym. Nevertheless, in the last years a new conceptual map has gradually been developed as an underlying tool for the online Translation Studies Bibliography. This TSB map has an open and descriptive character and tries to bring an added value to the conceptualization and the interrelationships between concepts that are often used ambiguously or even in an idiosyncratic way. This contribution describes the development and construction of that new map and concludes by calling for criticism, changes and additions. © John Benjamins Publishing Company.","Bibliography; Mapping; Transfer; Translation studies",,,,,,,,"Bausch, K.-Richard, Josef Klegraf and Wolfram Wilss. 1970.

This article deals with polysemy and synonymy, and consists of three parts. The introductory part gives a brief description of the dictionaries and encyclopedias published up to the présent time and justifies the choice of the examples in this case study, namely the polysemie term coherence and four synonymous pairs of concepts and terms: documentary/instrumental translation, overt/covert translation and interlingual interpretive/'interlingual descriptive communication as well as direct/indirect translation. The second part offers a comparison between the various dictionaries and encyclopedias and shows how the polysemic term coherence and the related pairs of concepts/terms are dealt with. It also indicates how the profusion of terminology could more effectively meet the needs of everyone who is engaged in translation and Translation Studies. The purpose of the third part is to demonstrate that in the training of translators, it is necessary to dispose of a metalanguage and that terminological diversity as a reflection of theoretic-conceptual diversity may be seen as an opportunity. © John Benjamins Publishing Company.","Coherence; Direct/indirect translation; Documentary/instrumental translation; Interlingual interpretive/interlingual descriptive communication; Overt/covert translation",,,,,,,,"(1998) Routledge encyclopedia of Translation Studies, , Baker, Mona, ed, London and New York: Routledge; Baker, (1998) Dubbing, pp. 74-76. , Mona and Brancaron;o Hochel, Baker; Beaugrande, Robert-Alain de and Wolfgang U.

It maintains that translation is of the utmost importance in the news agencies and that it is inseparable from other journalistic practices that intervene in the production of news. Rejecting the naïve view that translations are often improvised by people who do not have the necessary training, the article claims that the news editor has the specific skills required for the elaboration of such translations, and that the organisation of news agencies has been conceived in order to facilitate communication flows between different linguistic communities so as to reach global publics with maximum speed and efficiency. If news translation has traditionally been neglected by Translation Studies it is because it usually is in the hands of journalists rather than translators. A detailed examination of the nature and processes involved in news translation problematises central concepts such as authorship and equivalence and leads Translation Studies in new directions. © John Benjamins Publishing Company.","Globalisation; Journalism; News agencies; News translation",,,,,,"Arts and Humanities Research Council, AHRC","* I would like to thank the editor of Target and the anonymous reviewer for their helpful suggestions on an earlier version of this paper, which has been written thanks to the funding provided by the Arts and Humanities Research Council of Great Britain for an interdisciplinary research project on ‘Translation in Global News’.","(2000) Manual del Servicio Espan̄ol, , AFP, Montevideo; Bassnett, S., Writing and translating (2006) The translater as writer, pp. 173-183. , Susan Bassnett and Peter Bush, eds, London and New York: Continuum; Zaborras, C., Carmen and Ma José Hernández Navarro (2005) La traducción periodística, , Cuenca: Ediciones de la Universidad de Castilla-La Mancha; Cronin, M., (2000) Across the lines: Travel, language, translation, , Cork: Cork University Press; Cronin, M., (2003) Translation and globalization, , London and New York: Routledge; González, G., Enrique, J., Palabra, espacio y tiempo (2005) Cortés Zaborras and Hernández Navarro 2005, pp. 137-154; García Suárez, P., Noticias de agencia: Algunos problemas planteados en la traducción español-árabe (2005) Cortés Zaborras and Hernández Navarro 2005, pp. 175-197; Gile, D., Translation research versus interpreting research: Kinship, differences and prospects for partnership (2004) Translation research and interpreting research: Traditions, gaps and synergies, pp. 10-34. , Christina Schäffner, ed, Clevedon: Multilingual Matters; Goldscheider, E., Found in translation (2004) Boston globe magazine, 24, pp. 34-42; Hannerz, U., (1996) Transnational connections, , London and New York: Routledge; Hernández Navarro, Ma José. 2005.

Kuo Pao Kun's work shows us the ""little man"" and demonstrates that English is the language of power. Quah Sy Ren's work explores the plight of the local Chinese-speaker, suggesting that Chinese-Singaporeans are more firmly anchored in their cultural identity. In Alfian Sa'at's work the single heterolingual speaker is splintered into a variety of roles shaped by age, ethnicity, and gender, with heterolingualism being a mark of intergenerational and interracial tension. These three plays offer three solutions to the problem of forging a Singaporean identity: one based on Singlish, one based on Chinese, and one based on multilingualism and translation. They destabilize the notion of independent and self-sufficient languages, thereby challenging the notion of equivalence in translation. © John Benjamins Publishing Company.","Alfian sa'at; Code switching; Heterolingualism; Identity formation; Kuo pao kun; Quah sy ren; Singapore theatre; Singlish",,,,,,,,"Singlish 'A handicap we do not wish on Singaporeans' (1999) Straits times, p. 26. , 15 August, Anonymous; Bakhtin, Mikhaïl. 1981.

Affected by this inequality, theatre texts resort to verbal resources whose functions vary according to the language in which they are written and the community to which they are addressed. Thus, French-Canadian plays exhibit a code-switching practice that reflects the reality of North America's French minority's exposure to the dominant influence of English and is, therefore, difficult to translate into English. The accent displayed on stage by the characters is also a manifestation of a heterolingualism that contributes to an extremely complex identity-dynamic particular to the spoken word. This study focuses upon the accents and the code-switching found in plays by Michel Tremblay, Jean Marc Dalpé and Robert Lepage in order to identify the functions they perform and their representation in the translated English versions. © John Benjamins Publishing Company.","Accent; Canada; Code-switching; Heterolingualism; Identity; Theatre",,,,,,,,"Bosley, Vivianne. 1988.

This article tries to offer a contribution in that sense. The article is based on findings derived from the author's own attempt at translating into French The lonely Londoners, a novel by the Indo-Trinidadian writer Samuel Selvon. It explores the aesthetic and ethical questions that underlie the practice of literary translation in a minority context and a critical paradigm that values linguistic and cultural hybridity. This analysis leads to a critique of the ""ethics of translation"" put forward by Antoine Berman and Lawrence Venuti. It suggests more particularly that the translation of linguistic hybridity in literature raises a number of questions that go far beyond the choice between foreignizing/travail sur la lettre or domesticating/traduction ethnocentrique. From translation scholars, it demands at least an attempt at thinking the translation process in a way that would be less binary, and the translating agent in terms that would be less individualistic. © John Benjamins Publishing Company.","Ethics; Hybridity; Literature; Samuel selvon; Translation",,,,,,,,"Allsopp, R., (1996) Dictionary of Caribbean English usage, , Oxford: Oxford University Press; Ashcroft, B., Griffith, G., Tiffin, H., (1989) The empire writes back: Theory and practice in Post-Colonial literatures, , London: Routledge; (1998) Routledge encyclopedia of Translation Studies, , Baker, Mona, ed, London & New York: Routledge; Berman, A., (1984) L'épreuve de l'étranger, , Paris: Gallimard; Berman, A., La Traduction comme épreuve de l'étranger (1985) Texte, 4, pp. 67-81; Berman, A., (1995) Pour une critique des traductions: John Donne, , Paris: Gallimard; Bernabé, J., Confiant, R., Chamoiseau, P., (1989) Éloge de la créolité, , Paris: Gallimard; Birbalsingh, F., Sam Selvon: A celebration (1996) ARIEL, 27 (2), pp. 49-63; Bourdieu, Pierre. 1998 [© 1992].

More precisely, it proposes a model for describing the différent modalities of international circulation - referred to here as translation channels - based on the statistical analysis of a relevant set of variables. These channels allow us to present a gradation of the degree of politicization and institutionalization of the literary transfer, and to go well beyond an analysis in terms of the undifferentiated flow of imported books or the simple opposition of authorized vs. unauthorized translations or submissive vs. dissenting writers. © John Benjamins Publishing Company.","Authorized vs. non-authorized circulation; Communism; Eastern Europe-France; Literary transfer; Politicization; Quantitative analysis; Translation channels",,,,,,,,"Aron, Paul, Frédérique Matonti and Gisèle Sapiro, dir. 2002.

Students working into Ll found the task as difficult after three semesters as they had at the beginning of their studies. For students translating into their L2, translation did get significantly easier as judged by the objective measures of time and keystrokes, but the students' subjective assessment of difficulty and satisfaction was unchanged.

This article seeks to provide some insights into what happens to multilingual literature in translation. First, Antoine Berman's writings on translation are used to reframe questions of semantic loss in terms of the ideological underpinnings of translation as a cultural practice. This leads to a wider consideration of contextual aspects involved in the ""refraction"" of foreign languages, such as the translating literature's relative position in the ""World Republic of Letters"" (Casanova). Drawing on a Canadian case-study (Marie-Claire Biais in English translation), it is suggested that asymmetrical relations between dominating and dominated literatures need not be negative per se, but can lead to the recognition of minority writers. © John Benjamins Publishing Company.","Antoine berman; French-Canadian literature (1900-1999); Marie-claire biais; Minorities in literature; Multilingualism and literature; Pascale casanova; Pierre bourdieu; Ralph manheim; Ray ellenwood; Translation",,,,,,,,"(1998) Routledge encyclopedia of Translation Studies, , Baker, Mona, ed, London/New York: Routledge; Bakhtin, Mikhaïl M. 1981.

So far few systematic work deals with the question of their production and/or réception, their impact, their cultural and linguistic effects. This transfer is often seen as exclusively ""practical"", if not ""mechanical"". And it is a paradox that the linguistic perspective is dominant, whereas the object is multisemiotic, combining images, sounds, language (oral and written), colours, proxemicsji, gesture, etc., integrated into audiovisual codes (directing for the stage, sets of sequences and shots, voices and lights, scenograhy, narrative conventions, etc.). Two factors may account for this paradox and limitation: on the one hand, the training of researchers and their background ; on the other constraints of (printed) publications. First the entire field of study will be circumscribed (Sections 1 and 2); then subtitling (Section 3), the other modes of transfer (Section 4) and their theoretical and socio-cultural implications (Section 5) will be dealt with. One basic and strong consideration is underlying : audiovisual translation is not necessarily either a problem or a configuration of problems, it is rather a solution and an asset in multilingual and intercultural interaction. © John Benjamins Publishing Company.","Concepts/ terminology; Didactic positions and functions; Interdisciplinarity; Modes of audiovisual translation (TAV); Research; Technological/socio-cultural evolution",,,,,,,,"Agost, R., (1999) Traductión y doblaje: Palabras, voces e imágeries, , Barcelona: Ariel; Agost, R., Translation in bilingual contexts : Different norms in dubbing translation (2004) Orero 2004, pp. 63-82; Alexieva, B., A typology of Interpreter-mediated events (1997) The translator, pp. 153-174. , 3:2; Alexieva, B., Interpreter-mediated TV events (1999) Target, 11 (2), pp. 329-356; Alexieva, B., Interpreter-mediated télevision live interviews (2001) Gambier & Gottlieb 2001, pp. 113-124; Assis Rosa, A., Features of oral and written communication in subtitling (2001) Gambier & Gottlieb 2001, pp. 213-221; Avila, A., (1997) El doblaje, , Madrid, Cátedra; (1960) Babel, 6, p. 3. , Cinéma et traduction; (1994) Il doppiaggio: Trasposiozioni linguistiche e culturali, , Baccolini, Raffaella, Rosa Maria Bollettieri Bosinelli & Laura Gavioli, eds, Bologna: CLUEB; Ballester Casado, A., (2001) Traductión y nacionalismo : La receptión del cine americano en España a través del doblaje (1928-1948), , Granada: Editorial Comares; Ballester Casado, A., La traducción de referencias culturales en el doblaje : El caso de American Beauty (Sam Mendes, 1999) (2003) Sendebar, 14, pp. 77-96; Bartrina, F., The challenge of research in audiovisual translation (2004) Orero 2004, pp. 157-168; Benecke, B., Audiodescription (2004) Meta, 49 (1), pp. 78-80; Biq, Y.-O., From TV talk to screen caption (1993) Text, 13 (3), pp. 351-369; Bosinelli, B., Maria, R., Film dubbing: Linguistic and cultural issues (1994) Il Traduttore Nuovo, 42 (1), pp. 7-28; (2000) La traduzione multimediale : Quale traduzione per quale testo? / Multimedia translation: Which translation for which text, , Bollettieri Bosinelli, Rosa Maria, Christine Heiss, Marcello Soffritti & Silvia Bernardini, eds, Bologna, CLUEB; (2001) Cadernos de Tradução, 7 (1), pp. 53-306; Caillé, P., Cinéma et traduction: Le traducteur devant l'écran (1960) Babel, 6 (3), pp. 103-109; Caillé, Pierre. 1967.

The debate over the 'foreignness' or the 'domesticity' of a text or translation is usually conducted in a rather polarizing fashion, as in the case of Venuti (1995). Venuti's conceptual framework fails to provide adequate criteria for differentiating domesticating and foreignizing translation strategies, which easily results in inflated claims about the linguistic hegemony of the Anglo-American world. In reaction to this, the article reconceptualizes the two translation strategies as part of the paradoxical internai logic of culture in order to highlight how every culture is continually in the process of (re-)translating itself. Therefore, the analysis is broadened to include the domesticating aspects of the foreignizing strategy, and vice versa, the foreignizing potential of domesticating translations. The domestication of the foreign is evident in the ambiguous inclusion of non-English or bilingual texts in American literary histories. The foreignization of the domestic, by contrast, appears from a persistent tendency on the part of literary historians to describe their forerunners or competitors as excessively Anglo- or Eurocentric. Through this reflexive application of Venuti's strategies, the article draws attention to the paradoxical togetherness of the foreign and the domestic inside American literary culture. © John Benjamins Publishing Company.","American literary history; Anglocentrism; Domestication/foreignization; Language politics; Multilingualism; Translation",,,,,,,,"Baym, N., Early histories of American literature: A chapter in the institution of New England (1989) American literary history, 1 (3), pp. 459-488; Duyckinck, E.A., Duyckinck, G.L., (1855) Cyclopaedia of American literature, , 2 vols.

Language plurality will here be studied from an institutional viewpoint: the influence of the Canadian government on the translation of political speeches. The first part of this article will establish that political speeches are written in a bilingual environment where the two officiai languages are often in contact. This bilingualism, however, is often homogenised when it cornes to speech delivery and publication. Therefore, the second part focuses on the speeches' paratextual features and the third looks at the speeches' textual features. © John Benjamins Publishing Company.","Bilingual institutions; Canada; Language plurality; Political speeches; Pragmatic translation; Translation status",,,,,,,,"Bell, A., Language style as audience design (1984) Language in society, 13, pp. 145-204; Brunette, L., Normes et censure: Ne pas confondre (2002) TTR, 15 (2), pp. 223-233; Buzzetti, H., Colloque à l'Université de l'Alberta: Les francophones hors-Québec font le procès du nationalisme québécois (1999) Le Devoir, pp. A2. , 13 décembre; Chrétien, J., (1985) Straight from the heart, , Toronto: Key Porter Books; Delisle, Jean. 1984/2003.

By comparing pauses recorded from both processes, two temporal features were discovered: Firstly, the mean length of pause at textual category boundaries grew the higher the category was in the linguistic hierarchy. Secondly, the length of pause at clause level and lower was on average longer in translation than in monolingual text production, whereas pauses above clause level tended to be shorter in translation. Besides the differences in pause duration, translation also affected the use of total production time. Translation requires on average a longer revision and monitoring phase while the drafting phase is completed more quickly. Both writing tasks used approximately the same proportion of time for the orientation phase. © John Benjamins Publishing Company.","Pausing in translation; Translation process; Translog experiment; Writing process",,,,,,,,"Andriessen, Jerry, Koenraad de Smedt and Michael Zock. 1996.

The focus of attention is on the phenomenon of the pun involving the speak-ing name Ernest, whose homophony with earnest is exploited in the play's title. Italian translators of The importance have thus been faced with the bind of having to decide on whether to render the said wordplay, even though only unsatisfactorily, by replacing the transparent name Ernest with a target language 'equivalent', or safeguard the cultural-onomastic 'reality' of the play, i.e. leave the Victorian given name Ernest in its source text form. It turns out that the latter policy is generally compensated for - as part of the metatextual/ metalinguistic discourse - within prefaces, glosses and, more significandy, via intratextual additions. The translators opting for replacing Ernest with an Italian counterpart, in turn, have, as a direct consequence of their basic choice, been able to enrich their versions of The importance with unprecedented puns, which underlines the creative' dimension involved in producing literary translations. Besides the two core translation policies described above, the translators have also opted for introducing the nativized form Ernesto, thus showing little concern with the questions of 'cultural purity' or punning, respectively. The present paper suggests that translators make very different demands on themselves and have very different ideas of what constitutes the 'optimal' strategy with regard to punning and the representation of the source cultural world. © John Benjamins Publishing Company.","Adequacy vs. acceptability; Descriptive translation studies; Intertextuality; Italian translations; Onomastic wordplay; Oscar Wilde; Title translation",,,,,,,,"Wilde, O., L'importanza di far sul serio, tr.

I present the comparison theory of metaphor (Section 2), show how this can be integrated with the notions of lexicalization and non-lexicalization (Section 3) and consider the semantic purposes of metaphor (Section 4). The remainder of the paper focuses on the translation of metaphor, starting with more abstract langue-oriented notions. I offer a critique and revision of Newmark's (1988) metaphor typology (Section 5), and demonstrate how the revised typology can be integrated with the notions of lexicalization and non-lexicalization (Section 6). I then consider Lakoff and Johnson's (1980) model of metaphorical 'schemata, and propose ways in which this can also be integrated into an overall model (Section 7). I discuss the practical application of this model to Arabic-English translation (Section 8). In addition to langue-oriented notions, I suggest that a full account of metaphor for translation needs to take into account the more parole-oriented notion of the interaction of metaphors in texts. I consider the notions of metaphorical congruence (Section 9), and metaphorical exuberance and density. Illustrating my arguments with Arabic-English translation data, I suggest that in given registers, different languages may tolerate more or less metaphorical density and exuberance as well as different degrees of metaphorical mixing (Section 10). The paper concludes with a consideration of the kind of 'Full Model' one might build up for a detailed academic study of metaphor translation (Section 11). © John Benjamins Publishing Company.","Arabic; English; Metaphor; Translation",,,,,,,,"Alvarez, A., On translating metaphor (1993) META, 38 (3), pp. 479-490; Baker, Mona. 1992.

The article shows that Anchieta used a large amount of inculturation, a readiness to mix Catholic and native Indian terms, in order to achieve the catechism of the Indians, their acculturation into Catholicism. However, this inculturation always remained at a superficial level as Anchieta used terms from the spiritual world of the Tupi Indians but made no attempt to understand the deeper meaning of these terms. The article describes the background of Spanish and Portuguese colonizers in Latin America, lists the characteristics of the Tupi Indian language and analyzes a number of Anchieta's writings in Tupi in which he translated certain important Christian concepts into Tupi. © John Benjamins Publishing Company.","Cultural translation; Inculturation, acculturation; José de Anchieta; Translation in Brazil; Translation into Tupi; Translation of Jesuits; Tupi language",,,,,,,,"Anchieta, J.S.J., Poesias (1954) Manuscrite do século XVI, em português, castelhano, latim e tupi, tr.

Based on transcripts from interpreter-mediated court proceedings in New York City, the paper explores how interpreters respond when the participant status of their target recipients changes from addressee to unaddressed overhearer. The interpreters are found to design their utterances primarily to conform to institutional norms and not to the expectations of target recipients, who rely on politeness features as cues for their participant status. Adding to recent research on discourse processes in dialogue interpreting, the paper explores how the interpreter s task becomes more complex when more than two primary participants are present. © John Benjamins Publishing Company.","Court interpreting; Dialogue interpreting; Forms of address; Politeness; Pragmatics; Sociolinguistics; T/V-distinction; Variation",,,,,,,"* This material is based upon work supported by the National Science ?oundation under Grant No. BCS?03?7838.","Angermeyer, P.S., (2006) Speak English or what?': Codeswitching and interpreter use in New York City Small Claims Court, , New York University, Ph.D. Dissertation; Bell, A., Language style as audience design (1984) Language in society, 13, pp. 145-204; Berk-Seligson, S., (1990) The bilingual courtroom: Court interpretera in the judicial process, , Chicago: University of Chicago Press; Brown, P., Levinson, S.C., (1987) Politeness: Some universals in language usage, , Cambridge/New York: Cambridge University Press; Brown, R., Gilman, A., The pronouns of power and solidarity (1960) Style in language, pp. 253-276. , Thomas A.

The paper provides a list of partly overlapping motivations for adopting pseudotranslation and illustrates this motivation paradigm on the basis of particular findings in Graves's novels: if an author wants to attribute a pseudotranslation to an existing person, the author has to account for stylistic differences between the pseudotranslation and genuine texts by that person. By claiming to translate from a different source language than the language normally used by the existing person, the author of the pseudotranslation can mask those stylistic divergences. © John Benjamins Publishing Company.","Cultural planning; Fktitious translation; Literary translation; Pseudotranslation; Translation norms",,,,,,,,"Broeck, Raymond van den. 1999.

This study focuses specifically on the translation of titles of Australian children's fiction to determine whether the same 'readerly' concerns are evident in the wording of titles featuring Australian animais. French translations of Australian titles are compared with the same titles in other languages to establish the degree of similarity in patterns of translation regarding generic prioritisation, explicitation and simplification. The influence of original titles and their covers on subsequent translated titles, the phenomenon of translated titles 'copying' each other, and the appeal of 'exotic' referents in titles are considered within a framework of the nature and behaviour of titles in translation.

Box 260, DK-4000 ROSKILDE, Denmark","Taking my starting-point in Maria Tymoczko's claim (1999) that syntagmatic elements in texts present the greatest challenges to translators and readers of translations, I want to argue that literary translators and translation scholars need to pay greater attention to clusters of wordplay rather than distinguishing puns as individual, separate brain-teasers. Hence, more is at stake in the translation of wordplay than just trying to transfer the source text complexities into the target language. Historical, social and other contextual and intertextual factors must also be taken into consideration. My case in point is an examination of the transfer of highly challenging networks of puns in James Joyce's Ulysses (1922) into Danish and German. The theoretical frame of reference is a discussion of puns in the critical works of Dirk Delabastita, Jonathan Culler, Derek Attridge and Patricia Parker followed by a critique of translator and critic Frank Heibert's methods of evaluating the German translations. © John Benjamins Publishing Company.","James Joyce; Literary translation; Modernist prose; Motifs; Puns; Style; Translation criticism; Wordplay",,,,,,,,"Joyce, J., (1922) Ulysses, , New York: Random House; Joyce, J., (1922) Ulysses, , ed Hans Walter Gabier.

In French, detachment plays an important role in discourse, marking topic, focus, or emphasis; moreover, it is a strong marker of an informai conversational register. In English, other means are typically used to mark information structure and they do not necessarily differ in conversational and written registers. The study shows that the information structure conveyed by detachment is faithfully rendered in the translations, but the register function is undertranslated.

In the translation of a relatively easy text, novice and professional translators were found to behave fundamentally differently with respect to the size and nature of cognitive units and the speed with which they were produced. When faced with a difficult text, the behaviour in both groups was clearly affected, but some of the differences observed between novice and professional translators in the translation of the easy text were neutralized in that the professionals took over many of the features characteristic of the novices. © John Benjamins Publishing Company.","Cognitive psychology; Expertise; Keyboard logging; Problem solving; Segmentation; Translation process; Translation unit; Working memory",,,,,,,,"Baddeley, A., (1986) Working memory, , Oxford: Clarendon Press; Broadbent, D.E., The magie number seven after fifteen years (1975) Studies in long term memory, pp. 3-18. , Alan Kennedy and Alan Wilkes, eds, London: John Wiley & Sons; Butterworth, B., Evidence from pauses in speech (1980) Language production 1: Speech and talk, pp. 155-176. , Brian Butterworth, ed, London: Academic Press; Campbell, Stuart. 1999.

However, the concept of culture as such has remained elusive. A number of questions remain unanswered: How can we define a culture? What kind of empirical evidence is needed to prove the existence of a particular culture? Looking for answers, I start with a personal note, with my own previous attempt at conceptualizing translators' work in the European Commission by defining the EU institutions as a (multilingual and institutional) culture of its own. Responses to this model convey varying views of the concept of culture. By analyzing and contextualizing these responses it is my aim to provide some answers to the question of what kind of a construction culture is. The results of the analysis are then used to reflect on recent developments in Translation Studies. © John Benjamins Publishing Company.","Critical discourse analysis; Critical translation studies; Cultural studies; Culture; EU translation; Linguistics; Self-reflexivity",,,,,,,,"Arrojo, R., The revision of the traditional gap between theory & practice & the empowerment of translation in postmodern times (1998) The translater, 4 (1), pp. 25-48; Baker, Mona. 1996.

The subject is kept in approximately nine cases out of ten, with a somewhat higher degree of change in the scientific article. Where changes occur, they can very often be traced to differences between the languages on the lexical or syntactic level, but absolute differences signalled by identical behaviour of a whole translator group are as good as non-existent. After more features have been studied, it may be possible to identify profiles for the individual translators - and the two translator groups - showing to what extent their choices are guided by adequacy in relation to the source text vs. acceptability in relation to the target language. © John Benjamins Publishing Company.","Adequacy vs. acceptability; English/Norwegian; Subject selection; Translation corpora; Variation in translation",,,,,,"Norsk Fysioterapeutforbund, NPA",".?

The intercultural dialogue between them has, therefore, been antagonistic, polemical, and fraught with stereotypes and prejudices. This antagonistic dialogue is also reflected in Hebrew-Arabie translation activity, since the elements involved in this activity and the considerations which guided them both before and in the course of the translation were, first and foremost, political. The translations themselves were not accepted as literary creations, but rather as documents reflecting the culture of the other. Neither the presence of an ethnie Arab minority in Israel nor the peace agreements between Israel and certain Arab states brought about any significant change in the nature of translation activity. Clearly, therefore, in a state of violent national conflict translation activity will produce translations whose purpose is ideological rather than literary. © John Benjamins Publishing Company.","Antagonistic dialogue; Arab-Israeli conflict; Ideological considerations; Isolated translations; Refracted texts",,,,,,,,"Amara, M.H., (1999) Politics and sociolinguistic reflexes: Palestinian border villages, , Amsterdam/Philadelphia: John Benjamins; Amit-Kochavi, H., (1999) Tirgum sifrut caravit le-civrit: Ha-reqac ha-histori-tarbuti šelahem, me'afyenehem u-macmadam be-tarbut ha-matara, , Translations of Arabic literature into Hebrew: Their historical and cultural background and their reception by the target culture, Tel-Aviv: Tel-Aviv University, Unpublished PhD dissertation.

Translation, as a mode of cross-cultural communication, is held to share those same features, as well as at least two specific representational maxims concerning discursive persons and textual quantity. It is argued that the related concepts of complexity, success conditions and risk can describe not only the act of translating as a mode of cross-cultural communication, but also certain features of the professional intercultures to which translators belong. Step-by-step propositions thus synthesize an approach that runs from an analysis of cross-cultural communication to a description of professional intercultures, their sources of power, and the reasons for their apparent lack of power in a globalizing age. © John Benjamins Publishing Company.","Communication theory; Complexity theory; Cross-cultural communication; Intercultures; Power; Risk management; Translation",,,,,,,,"Agar, M., (1994) Language shock: Understanding the culture of conversation, , New York: William Morrow; Bourdieu, P., (1979) Le sens pratique, , Paris: Minuit; Chatwin, B., (1987) The songlines, , London: Picador; Chesterman, A., From 'is' to bught': Laws, norms and strategies in Translation Studies (1994) Target, 5 (1), pp. 1-20; Chesterman, A., Karl Popper in the translation class (1994) Teaching translation and interpreting 2: Insights, aims and visions, pp. 89-95. , Cay Dollerup and Annette Lindegaard, eds, Amsterdam/Philadelphia: John Benjamins; Chesterman, A., (1997) Memes of translation, , Amsterdam/Philadelphia: John Benjamins; Chesterman, A., Proposai for a Hieronymic oath (2001) The return to ethics.

It shows that the contingency of dialect variation upon narrative point of view (focalization) is not taken into account in translation, an omission that alters the ideological framework of the novel. In addition, it argues that the maintenance of this variation, when systematic, should be at least as important a concern as, for instance, the most accurate translation of single dialectal or non-standard words and utterances. © John Benjamins Publishing Company.","English; Faulkner; French; Ideology; Literary dialect; Point of view; Polyphony; Sociolect",,,,,,,,"Faulkner, William. 1949.

Industrial standards like the ISO family provide the basis of many such Systems; however, for several reasons, such process-based standards are regarded by many as inappropriate for translation businesses. One common factor considered in this article is their failure to emphasise the role of people both in the definition of the processes and in their implementation. The present article proposes a new model for translation businesses, accepting the importance of people in the translation industry and recognising that process-driven quality Systems may be inadequate in maintaining consistent levels of quality. The model is based on identifying the capabilities that incorporate the processes of an organisation and the behaviours embodied in the people involved in these processes. In this article, the model is referred to as Acquired Capabilities for Translation Systems (ACTS). © John Benjamins Publishing Company.","Behaviours; Capabilities; Innovation; Networking; Quality assessment; Standards; Translation industry; Translation process",,,,,,,,"Bank, J., (1992) The essence of Total Quality Management, , New York-London: Prentice Hall; Chesterman, A., Wagner, E., (2002) Can theory help translators?: A dialogue between the ivory tower and the wordface, , Manchester: St. Jerome; Deming, Edwards. 1992.

In multilingual geopolitical contexts, geo-linguistic barriers between 'source' and 'target' cultures are indefinite so that translations, both as a process and as a product, also function in the source culture, co-determining e.g. the textual translation strategies and the reception of the translated novels. The notion of 'interculture' becomes fondamental and the roles of intercultural agents (authors, translators, critics) are interchangeable. Still, 'sources' and 'targets' do survive in the perception of these actors, their actual definition being function of the internalisation of social structures and socio-cultural power relations by these individuals and of their positions in both 'source' and 'target' cultures. In order to redefine these basic concepts in a sufficiently flexible way, a more sociological orientation of DTS is thus necessary, integrating and elaborating the 'habitus' concept in the model. © John Benjamins Publishing Company.","DTS; Habitus; Intercultural agents; Literatures in Belgium; Multilingual societies; Sociology of translation",,,,,,,,"(2002) Actes de la recherche en sciences sociales, 144. , septembre; Anderson, Benedict. 19912.

Thus, it makes use of theories related to such a type of dynamics (chaos theory and complexity science). This concern develops on two levels: firstly, the article argues that the abandonment of the traditional conception of translation and the raising of the current one actually agree with the evolution perceived in a great number of domains, such an evolution pointing to the rejection of deterministic positions. Secondly, it also defends the view that the translation process is entirely typical of the processes of nonlinear dynamics. Accordingly, key notions from nonlinear dynamics (such as sensitivity to initial conditions, phase transition, attractor or edge of chaos) are shown to apply to the nature of translation. © John Benjamins Publishing Company.","Chaos theory; Complexity science; Edge of chaos; Nonlinear dynamics; Translation; Translation studies; Unpredictability",,,,,,"Xunta de Galicia","* This article is a revised version of Longa (2004).

It then examines the textual significance of leitmotifs as 'vertical translation units', since both are found to be related to repetitions of a rank-free text element in formulating a network of signification. In leitmotif-conscious translating, it argues, the accountability between the source and target texts can be observed at this level of textual network, while the translation, as a literary text, may induce different perlocutionary effects when functioning in a different cultural milieu. © John Benjamins Publishing Company.","Artistic effect; Discourse awareness; Functional linguistics; Intention; Leitmotif; Literariness; Partisan literature; Speech act theory; Text linguistics; Vertical translation unit",,,,,,,,"Abrams, M.H., (1999) A glossary of literary terms, , New York, London, Toronto, etc, Harcourt Brace College Publishers; Austin, J.L., (1955) How to do things with words, , The William James Lectures in , Oxford: Clarendon; Baker, Mona. 1992.

Significant differences are found between the English of literary translation and contem-porary literary English writing, in terms of both variety of contracted forms encountered and frequency of occurrence of contractions. Qualitative analyses then focus on the functional description of some contracted and non-contracted forms, and also consider the contraction practices of different translators. The relationships between contractions and other linguistic features, explicitation in translation, translator style, discourse fonction and genre are touched upon, and avenues for further research of this nature are suggested. © John Benjamins Publishing Company.","Contracted forms; Contractions; Corpus-based translation studies; English literary translations; Explicitation; Register analysis; Translational English corpus; Translator style",,,,,,,,"Baker, M., Corpora in Translation Studies: An overview and some suggestions for future research (1995) Target, 7 (2), pp. 223-243; Baker, Mona. 1996.

In the study four major sources of explanation are proposed: individual situations (the context of production of a particular translation and different translators' attitudes); textuality (the conditions governing textuality implied in translation); translators' norms; and intersecting fields (academic translation is envisaged as being situated at the intersection of three fields: academia, publishing, and professional translation). The paper makes a case for multiple causality in translation, and also considers the issue of relations between the different sources of explanation. © John Benjamins Publishing Company.","Descriptive-explanatory translation research; English translation of Jean-François Lyotard; Individual situations, textuality, translators' norms, social fields; Multiple causation of translational phenomena",,,,,,,,"Lyotard, J.-F., Le travail du rêve ne pense pas (1971) Discours, figure, pp. 239-270. , Paris: Editions Klincksieck; Lyotard, J.-F., (1974) Economie libidinale, , Paris: Editions de Minuit; Lyotard, J.-F., (1977) Instructions païennes, , Paris: Editions Galilée; Lyotard, J.-F., La condition postmoderne (1979) Rapport sur le savoir, , Paris: Editions de Minuit; Lyotard, J.-F., Discussions, ou: Phraser 'après Auschwitz' (1981) Les fins de l'homme: À partir du travail de Jacques Derrida, pp. 283-310. , P.

Viewing deixis as an interactive feature of texts, it endeavours to find whether there are significant differences between the use of deixis in source texts and translations, and to see how systematic shifts as well as single occurrences can contribute to the shaping of a translated text which positions the reader in a different way from the source texts. It also explores ways in which the translators position themselves with respect to the text. The study finds that the main tendency is one of distancing, whereby proximal deictics tend to become distals, with the effect that readers will be presented with a translation which elicits less involvement on their part than the original text did in its context. © John Benjamins Publishing Company.","Corpus; Deixis; Discourse; Romanian; Shift; Translation",,,,,,,,"Baker, M., Corpus Linguistics and Translation Studies: Implications and applications (1993) Text and technology: In honour of John Sinclair, pp. 233-250. , and, eds, Amsterdam/Philadelphia: John Benjamins; (1998) The Routledge encyclopedia of Translation Studies, , Baker, Mona, ed, London and New York: Routledge; Cartianu, A., Levrtchi, L., Ştefǎnescu-Drǎgǎneşti, V., (1964) An advanced course in modern Romanian, , Bucharest: Publishing House for Scientific Books; Crystal, D., (1985) A dictionary of linguistics and phonetics, , 2nd edition.

One of the major problems affecting Spanish translation in this field derives from the high flexibility of English towards conversion, the process whereby a term belonging to a specific grammatical category can be used with different syntactic functions without requiring change in its form. Although no agreement exists on the definition and extent of conversion, this process poses some important problems for the Spanish translation.

Both versions were translated by Rivka Meshulach, with approximately 25 years between them. In the first version word order conforms to the norms of Classical Hebrew. In the second version, however, the translator changed word order so that the language would be closer to contemporary spoken Hebrew. This is illustrated through examples related to various syntactic constituents, including subject-predicate, predicate complements, parentheme and address forms. The reasoning behind this tendency focuses on the change in the norms of written language. As opposed to the normative restrictions which were widely accepted in written Hebrew just a generation ago, the current trend is for features of contemporary spoken language to be used in literature and theater. © John Benjamins Publishing Company.","Changes; Hebrew; Spoken language; Theater norms; Word order; Written language",,,,,,,,"Avineri, I., Subject-Predicate Order (1964) Yad halašon, , Tel Aviv: Izreel Publishing House, in Hebrew; Azar, M., Towards an understanding of topicalized sentence structure in contemporary Hebrew (1992) Oman et al. 1992, pp. 87-99. , in Hebrew; Bahat, Y., Ron, M., (1966) Vedayek, , Tel Aviv: Hakibbutz Hameuchad, in Hebrew; Ben-Asher, M., (1969) The formation of normative grammar, , Tel Aviv: Hakibbutz Hameuchad, in Hebrew; Bendavid, A., (1971) Biblical Hebrew and mishnaic Hebrew II, , Tel Aviv: Dvir, in Hebrew; Ben-Horin, G., Aspects of syntactic preposing in spoken Hebrew (1976) Studies in modern Hebrew syntax and semantics, pp. 193-207. , Peter Cole, ed, Amsterdam: North-Holland; Ben-Shahar, R., Linguistic and stylistic norms in the translation of English and French plays into Hebrew during the 1950s and 1960s (1989) Dapim le-mehqar be-sifrut, 5-6, pp. 331-344. , in Hebrew; Ben-Shahar, R., (1990) Language of narrative fiction, , Tel Aviv: The Open University of Israel, in Hebrew; Ben-Shahar, R., Spoken and written language in Israeli narrative fiction in the 80s (1992) Oman et al. 1992, pp. 163-174. , in Hebrew; Ben-Shahar, R., (1996) The language of Hebrew drama, pp. 11-22,65-72. , Tel Aviv: Hakibbutz Hameuchad, in Hebrew; Ben-Shahar, R., S.

In this paper, I discuss the possible cognitive basis for the patterns/processes that have been variously referred to as simplification/generalization, normalization, standardization, sanitization, and exaggeration of target language features. The framework that I adopt is that of cognitive grammar, and my claim is that all of the above arise from the existence of asymmetries in the cognitive organization of semantic information. I also propose that the converse case is true: cases involving a lack of conspicuous cognitive asymmetries will demonstrate the opposite effect in translated text. In closing, I place the argument in a larger perspective by adopting Croft's (1990) scalar notion of generalization in a discussion of explanation in translation studies. © John Benjamins Publishing Company.","Explanation in translation studies; Translation and cognition; Translation and semantic networks; Translation universals",,,,,,,,"Baker, Mona. 1992.

The problem with this approach is that it does not allow the researcher to draw conclusions about the actual organisation of the cognitive processes and its effects on text quality. In writing research, functional dependency of cognitive processes - the fact that the context, function and effect of different cognitive processes vary according to the moment in the process on which they occur - was demonstrated by Rijlaarsdam and Van den Bergh (1996). In the present paper the idea is developed that in translation process research, the inclusion of time as a variable may prove to be useful in improving understanding of the effect of process characteristics on process outcome. A dynamic approach, in which a translation process is viewed and analysed as belonging to a changing task situation, is proposed. © John Benjamins Publishing Company.","Changing task situation; Cognitive processes; TAP-analysis; Think-aloud protocols; Translation processes; Variability in translation processes",,,,,,,,"Anderson, J.R., (1995) Cognitive psychology and its implications, , New York: Freeman; Ericsson, Karl Anders and Herbert Simon. 1980.

Simultaneously, more and more studies have been dedicated to the translation of children's literature. There are four important factors which have prompted such studies: (1) the assumption that translated children's books build bridges between different cultures, (2) text-specific challenges to the translator, (3) the polysystem theory which classifies children's literature as a subsystem of minor prestige within literature, and (4) the age-specific addressees either as implied or as real readers.

Analysis of the translation of fictional dialogues from a contemporary English novel reveals considérable diversity in the choice of Spanish verbs used to render 'said' in the context of impositive directive speech acts. While the choice of a speech act with similar illocutionary force to ""said"" may fulfil only stylistic objectives, a pragmatic dimension is introduced by the selection of a speech-act verb with a different force. In the context of impositive directive speech acts such a choice may be viewed as an aspect of ""pragmastylistics"", defined in Hickey et al.

Christianity has been a traditional candidate for such manipulation. Fear and hatred of the ""younger"" religion may have accounted for the subversive treatment of Christian elements in Hebrew texts. Strategies varied, depending on period and norm, mostly involving omission of undesirable material, but often converting the text into a more acceptable ideological type. Ben-Hur: A taie of the Christ (1880) by Lew Wallace is one of the novels most translated and most tampered with, and due to its predominantly Christian character, it can serve as an illuminating case study both for the subversion of Christian elements and for the more ""créative"" conversion into the ""Few against Many"" or ""Jewish bravura against the Roman Empire"" model. © John Benjamins Publishing Company.","Christianity and Judaism; Conversion and assimilation in translated literature; Fear of the ""Other""; History rewritten; Ideological manipulation; Jesus in Jewish and Hebrew culture; Self-censorship; Subversion of translated texts",,,,,,,,"Auerbach, B., Briefe an seinem Freund Jakob Auerbach: Ein biographisches Denkmal.

The paper focuses on the problems posed by French surrealist poetry, where the reader was held to be as important as the writer in creating interpretations, and argues that evaluations involving these poems inevitably require reader-response data. The paper explores empirically, in the context of André Breton's ""L'Union libre"", whether a modification of Think-Aloud procedure, called Note-Down, applied both to the original text and to three English translations, can contribute useful information to a traditional close reading approach. The results suggest that comparative Note-Down protocols permit simple cost-benefit analyses and allow one to track phenomena, like the persistence of an effect through the text, which might be hard to obtain by other methods. © John Benjamins Publishing Company.","Breton; Hypothesis testing; Note-down; Poetry translation; Reader-response; Surrealism; Think-aloud; Translation evaluation",,,,,,,,"Adamowicz, E., Narcisse se noie: L'Union libre d'André Breton (1989) Romanic review, 80 (4), pp. 571-581; Adamowicz, Elza. 1998.

The aim was to identify the linguistic features shared by texts assumed to be translations, as well as those shared by texts assumed to be originally produced. The results show (i) that translations were not readily identifiable, and (ii) that the feature that seemed to guide the subjects' decisions was the frequency vs. scarcity of target language specifie (unique) items in the texts: their frequency led subjects to assume - correctly or incorrectly - that a text was original rather than translated. It is concluded that the unique items in nontranslations vs. translations deserve further research in respect of their frequency and the impressions they make on readers. © John Benjamins Publishing Company.","Identifiability as translation; Linguistic features of translations; Translated language; Translation quality; Translationese; Unique items; Universals of translation",,,,,,,,"Baker, M., Corpus linguistics and translation studies: Implications and applications (1993) Text and technology: In honour of John Sinclair, pp. 233-250. , and, eds, Amsterdam, Philadelphia: John Benjamins; Baker, M., Corpora in translation studies: An overview and some suggestions for future research (1995) Target, 7, pp. 223-243; Baker, Mona. 1996.

Not surprisingly, the trend seems to arise from other audiovisual forms and media. Overall, however, the positive audience response towards certain dubbed products seems to depend more on the good promotion and quality of the specific programmes than on the individual merits of any language transfer method per se, as most language transfer commissioners seem indifferent to the implications of such a choice. © 2001 John Benjamins Publishing Company.","Audiovisual translation; Children’s TV programs; Dubbing; Film; Greece; Norm; Revoicing; Subtitling",,,,,,,,"Aaltonen, O., Subtitling as culture-bound meaning production (1995) Communication Audiovisuelle Et Transferts Linguistiques/Audiovisual Communication and Language Transfer, pp. 384-387. , [= Translatio: Nouvelles de la FIT Nouvelle série XIV: 3-4]; Hellas, A., (1995) TV Yearbook 94-95, , Athens: Organopublica A.E; Hellas, A., (1996) TV Yearbook 95-96, , Athens: Organopublica A.E; Blane, S., Interlingual subtitling in the languages degree (1996) Teaching Translation in Universities: Present and Future Perspectives, pp. 183-207. , Penelope Sewell and Ian Higgins, eds, London: CILT; Messenger, D., (1989) Television is Good for Your Kids, , London: Hilary Shipman; Doulkeri, T., (1992) Elliniki Tileorasi: Empeiriki Ereuna, , [Greek television: Empirical research].

The serious questions regarding the experimental validity of this research methodology when applied to translation have nonetheless often remained unspoken. This paper surveys the breakthroughs as well as the limits of the growing body of literature dealing with TAPs in TS, points at the necessity to take issues of experimental, theoretical and environmental validity more seriously, and offers suggestions for improvements.

Reflecting on translatability requires a discussion of Toury’s notion of ‘adequate translation’, which has two senses: The general or ideal approximation to source-text norms, and the tertium comparationis represented by a source-text-oriented translation (i.e. showing how the original ‘can’ be translated). It is argued that both senses have heuristic value in Translation Studies. The explanatory power of target-orientedness is demonstrated by discussing the various strategies pursued by seven Anglo-American translators of Dante who either re-create or avoid rewriting grotesque onomastic wordplay in Inferno. Zero translation policy of Dante’s names is not considered to be evidence of their inherent ‘untranslatability’ since for an empiricist nothing is untranslatable. Evocative names may be translated in a creative way provided the rewriter is willing (or allowed) to be innovative. © 2001 John Benjamins Publishing Company.",,,,,,,,,"Alighieri, D., (1966) La Commedia Secondo l’antica Vulgata, 4. , G.

It is argued that Polysystem theory and other cultural theories of translation, be they descriptive or politically committed, can be mutually enriching rather than incompatible, and that, with some augmentation and further development, it may serve as an adequate framework for research into the ‘external politics’ of translation. © 2001 John Benjamins Publishing Company.","Cultural turn; Descriptivism; Ideology; Norm; Politics; Polysystem; Polysystem theory; Translation studies",,,,,,,"* This research has benefited from financial and logistical support from the Research Committee and Arts Programme of Lingnan University, Hong Kong.","Bassnett, S., The translation turn in cultural studies (1998) Constructing Cultures: Essays on Literary Translation, pp. 123-140. , Susan Bassnett and André Lefevere, eds, Clevedon: Multilingual matters; Fung, C.N., (1997) Yes Prime Manipulator: A Descriptive Study of A Chinese Translation of British Political Humour, , University of Warwick.

Ali Rýza Seyfi, who was known as an author and translator of historical fiction and books on Turkish history, produced a version of the novel under the title Kazýklý Voyvoda, which was published in 1928 and reprinted in 1946. Kazýklý Voyvoda combines the original gothic aspects with a Turkish nationalist discourse, exemplifying the kind of role translation can assume in the making of national identities. The article traces the matricial norms employed by Seyfi to reveal those of his additions to Dracula that resulted in a highly nationalist text. It is further pointed out that Kazýklý Voyvoda stands in a specific relationship with the notions of “national” and “nationalist” literature, which were rather topical around the time the text was published. © 2001 John Benjamins Publishing Company.",,,,,,,,,"Anderson, B., (1993) Imagined Communities, , (1983), London & New York: Verso; Bastin, G.L., Adaptation (1998) Routledge Encyclopedia of Translation Studies, pp. 5-8. , Mona Baker, ed, London: Routledge; Chatman, S., (1978) Story and Discourse, , Ithaca: Cornell University Press; Coskun, S., (1938) Milli Bir Edebiyat Yaratabilir Miyiz?, , Istanbul: Inkilap Kitabevi; Lewis, B., (1961) The Emergence of Modern Turkey, , New York: Oxford University Press; Nayir, Y.N., (1937) Edebiyatimizin Bugünkü Meseleleri, , Istanbul: Kanaat Kitabevi; Özdenoglu, S., (1949) Edebiyatimizin Be§ Ana Meselesi, , Istanbul: Znkilap Kitabevi; Renan, E., What Is a Nation?

Au lieu d’analyser la faute comme un élément donnant accès à la culture (à la performance, au savoir, à l’ignorance...) du traducteur ou de son public, on aborde ici ce genre d’opérations textuelles comme une contrainte, c’est-à-dire comme un mécanisme de lecture et d’écriture qui s’applique systématiquement à l’ensemble d’un écrit. En tant que contrainte, la faute apparaît comme un élément permettant une nouvelle compréhension du texte-source et comme un défi à l’élaboration de nouveaux textes-cibles. Bien que les exemples donnés soient tous littéraires, l’intérêt du mécanisme analysé dépasse le seul champ littéraire. The aim of this article is to propose a new interpretation of the concept of ‘translation error’. Instead of reading the translation error as a key feature of understanding the target culture (that of the translator or that of his public), I will consider it a textual ‘constraint’, i.e. a formal mechanism systematically imposed upon a text. As a ‘constraint’, the error can be read as a key feature in a new understanding of the source text and as an opportunity to the creation of new target texts. Althoughmy examples are all literary, the mechanism described in this article has a more general scope. © 2001 John Benjamins Publishing Company.",,,,,,,,,"Borges, J.L., A un viejo poeta.

Most essays focus on the issue of (un)translatability”. The untranslatability of humour is found on two levels: “culture” and “language”. Although most reflections are empirically and/or theoretically deficient, they do show to some extent how these two abstract notions may be realized. However, if one is interested in “cultural mapping”, translated humour deserves more high-standard research: The presence, absence or modalities of humour translation are undeniable signs of community borders. This article provides an enlarged bibliography as a possible starting point for a more programmatic discussion that would integrate recent developments in Humour Studies and in Translation Studies. © 2001 John Benjamins Publishing Company.",,,,,,,,,"Alam, Q.Z., Humour and Translation: Evidence from Indian English (1989) Meta, 34 (1), pp. 72-78; Attardo, S., (1994) Linguistic Theories of Humor, , Berlin, New York: Mouton de Gruyter; Ballard, M., Effets dhumour, ambiguïté et didactique de la traduction (1989) Meta, 34 (1), pp. 20-25; Bertaux, P., Pour ce que rire est le propre de lhomme…’ (1986) Laurian, 1986, pp. 23-32; De, B.P., My Grandfather the Hunter: A Humorous Translation from Afrikaans to English (1989) Meta, 34 (1), pp. 79-83; Delabastita, D., Translating Puns: Possibilities and Restraints (1987) New Comparison, 3, pp. 143-159; Delabastita, D., (1990) There’s a Double Tongue: An Investigation into the Translation of Shakespeare’s Wordplay, , Leuven: Faculty of Arts.

In practice, the article examines the speeches uttered in Spanish and English before the European Parliament (EP) on 9th March 1993. The main focus of the study is transitivity shifts and their connection to ideological issues. This corpus has been chosen for various reasons. Amongst them, the paper sets out to test the conclusions reached by prior research (Trosborg 1997a; Koskinen 2000). Three basic questions are posed: 1. Are EP speeches odd, ‘out of place’/’strange’/’unusual’ (in short literal) as Koskinen (2000) maintains? (Descriptive component of analysis); 2. Does translation affect the ideological output of original texts? (Explanatory component of analysis); 3.Which perlocutionary questions may be raised as a result of the previous questions? (Perlocutionary component of analysis). © 2001 John Benjamins Publishing Company.","CDA; Description; European Parliament; Explanation; Halliday; Ideology; Illocutionary; Perlocutionary; Transitivity; Translational shifts",,,,,,,,"Baker, M., Linguistic and cultural studies: Complementary or competing paradigms in Translation Studies?

Investigation into the translational migration of martial arts fiction demonstrates that the “normal” position assumed by translated literature tends to be a peripheral one. However, different patterns of behaviour can be observed, depending on the hegemonic relations between source and target cultures. In theWest, martial arts fiction in English translation is being relegated to an extremely peripheral position. But martial arts fiction is able to make inroads into Asian countries, to the extent of stimulating a new literary form or (re)writing martial arts fiction in some indigenous languages. © 2001 John Benjamins Publishing Company.",,,,,,,,,"Bassnett, S., (1993) Comparative Literature: A Critical Introduction, , Oxford and Cambridge, MA: Blackwell; Bassnett, S., Moving Across Cultures: Translation as Intercultural Transfer (1997) Trasvases Culturales: Literatura, Cine, traducción, 2, pp. 7-20. , J.M.

A sample of 1013 menu items from the Tarragona area suggests there are differences in functionality between the menus translated in the 1970s/1980s and those translated in the 1990s. A possible reason for these differences is that all the menus from the 1970s/80s were translated by professional translators, and those from the 1990s, by non-professional translators. The study also suggests that books on menu translations published by the Catalan government in 1991 did not reach the restaurant owners and that official translation policy in this area has thus had little effect. © 2000 John Benjamins B.V., Amsterdam.",,,,,,,,,"Baker, M., (1992) Other Words: A Coursebook on Translation., , London and New York: Routledge; Caminade, M., Pym, A., (1995) Les Formations En Traduction Et interprétation: Essai De Recensement Mondial, , Paris: Société Française des Traducteurs; Crystal, D., (1995) The Cambridge Encyclopedia of the English Language, , Cambridge: Cambridge University Press; Catalunya, G.D., (1991) Vocabulari De Bars I Restaurants-Bar., , Barcelona: Gener-alitat de Catalunya.

But how is one to assess the significance of particular kinds of segment for the entire text under analysis? The present article tackles this methodological issue and reports on a study designed to provide quantitative data to answer that question. For that purpose, an analysis was conducted of translations by Frederico Mueller, the first Brazilian translator of the writings of Rudolf Steiner, the founder of Anthroposophy.

This article reports on a data-based study of professional translators undertaken in Hong Kong. The study reveals that recent social-political changes in the country have brought about changes in the needs of professional translators characterized by demand for better bilingual competence including mastery of Putonghua, better command of selective translation and more collaborative translation. It was also found that training in English and Chinese proved most helpful to professional translators at work, whereas training in interpretation and subject knowledge proved inadequate. The author recommends that training in L1 and L2 be strengthened, and translation teaching be brought closer to the real world through authentic training, thus responding to changing social needs. © 2000 John Benjamins B.V., Amsterdam.",,,,,,,,,"Berg, B.L., (1989) Qualitative Research Methods: For the Social Sciences, , Boston: Allyn & Bacon; Bogdan, R., Biklen, S.K., (1992) Qualitative Research for Education: An Introduction to Theory and Methods, , London: Allyn & Bacon; Bühler, H., Language and Translation: Translating and Interpreting as a Profession (1987) Language and Professions: Annual Review of Applied Linguistics, 7, pp. 105-119. , R.B.

The socio-linguistic situation of the native language, Galego (Galician), and the asymmetrical relations of power with respect to Castilian have been shaping and determining the dynamics of translation, and, to a certain extent, Galician cultural life in general. Translation therefore appears as a crucial and ambiguous activity, both contributing to the process of linguistic and cultural normalisation but also revealing the lingering weakness of the target language. Translation therefore becomes a powerful mirror on which to contemplate pressing domestic debates on language and identity. © 2000 John Benjamins B.V., Amsterdam.",,,,,,,,,"García, Á., (1988) O Libro Galego, Onte E Hoxe: Catálogo Da exposición bibliográfica.

This paper deals with the problems the use of FID may create for Finnish translators of English literary narratives. A comparative analysis of D.H.

The results confirm, on the one hand, existing differences in the comprehension and interpretation of text types and, on the other hand, that the confusion that exists in practice between the concepts of text type and genre (Hatim and Mason 1990) may also be observed in the case of these students. © 2000 John Benjamins B.V., Amsterdam.",,,,,,,,,"Adam, J.-M., (1992) Les Textes: Types Et Prototypes, , Paris: Nathan Université; Amtz, R., Steps toward a Translational-oriented Typology of Technical Texts (1988) Meta, 33 (4), pp. 468-471; Bassols, M., Torrent, A.M., (1996) Models Textuals: Teoria I pràctica, , Vic: Eumo Editorial; Bühler, H., Introductory Paper: Text Linguistics, Text Types and Prototypes (1988) Meta, 33 (4), pp. 465-467; Combettes, B., Types de textes et faits de langue (1987) Pratiques, 56, pp. 5-18; Emery, P., Text Classification and Text Analysis in Advanced Translation Teaching (1991) Meta, 36 (4), pp. 567-577; Gambier, Y., Tommola, J., (1993) Translation and Knowledge, SSOTTIV: Scandinavian Symposium on Translation Theory, Turku, 4.-6.6.1992, , Turku: University of Turku, School of Translation Studies; Hatim, B., Discovering Method in the Madness of Texts: A Text-type Approach (1993) Gambier and Tommola, 1993, pp. 351-361; Hatim, B., (1995) Text Typologies and Translation, , Seminar given at the Universitat Jaume I (Castellò), June 29-30; Hatim, B., Mason, I., (1990) Discourse and the Translator, , London: Longman; Hatim, B., Mason, I., (1997) The Translator as Communicator, , London: Routledge; House, J., (1981) A Model for Translation Quality Assessment, , Tübingen: Narr; Martin, J.R., (1992) English Text: System and Structure, , Amsterdam: John Benjamins; Neubert, A., Shreve, G.M., (1992) Translation as Text., , Kent, Ohio and London: The Kent State University Press; Reiß, K., (1982) Möglichkeiten Und Grenzen Der Übersetzungskritik, , München: Max Hueber; Schmidt, H., Violations of Textual Conventions in Translation (1993) Gambier and Tommola, 1993, pp. 339-349; Wilss, W., Thome, G., (1984) Die Theorie Des Übersetzens Und Ihr Aufschlußwert für Die Übersetzungs- Und Dolmetschdidaktik/Translation Theory and Its Implementation in the Teaching of Translating and Interpreting: Akten Des Internationalen Kolloquiums Der Association Internationale De Linguistique Appliquée (AILA), , Saarbrücken, 25.-30.

Paradigm shifts in the seventies and late eighties have intensified its overall production and are associated with the disappearance of some major production centers and the emergence of others. The total population of authors has increased over the years, but only a few dozen have shown long-term productive research activity, and much CIR is conducted independently of any academic institution. Institutional and economic factors seem to account for limitations in the development of CIR so far. Empirical studies represent only a small proportion of the total CIR production, but their proportion in M.A. and graduation theses is far higher. Limitations of quantitative analysis without a qualitative component are highlighted, and suggestions are made for further explorations along the way. © 2000 John Benjamins B.V., Amsterdam.",,,,,,,,,"Callón, M., Courtial, J.-P., Penan, H., (1993) La scientométrie, , Paris: Presses Universitaires de France; Cenkova, I., La recherche en interprétation dans les pays dEurope de l’Est: Une perspective personnelle (1995) Target, 7 (1), pp. 75-89; Aís, C., (1998) La evaluación De La Calidad En interpretación simultánea: La Importancia De La comunicación No Verbal, , Granada: Comares; Dodds, J., (1997) The Interaction between Research and Training: Introduction., 1997, pp. 89-92. , Gambier et al; Fabbro, F., Gran, L., (1997) Neurolinguistic Aspects of Simultaneous Interpretation., 1997, pp. 9-27. , Gambier et al; Gambetti, M., Mead, P., The Aarhus Seminar on Interpreting Research (Aarhus, 20-25 January 1997) (1998) The Interpreter’s Newsletter, 8, pp. 169-179; Gambier, Y., Gile, D., Taylor, C., (1997) Conference Interpreting: Current Trends in Research, , Amsterdam-Philadelphia: John Benjamins; Gerver, D., Wallace Sinaiko, H., (1978) Language Interpretation and Communication, , New York: Plenum Press; Gile, D., Opening Up in Interpretation Studies (1994) Translation Studies: An Interdiscipline, pp. 149-158. , Mary Snell-Hornby, Franz Pöchhacker and Klaus Kaindl, eds., AmsterdamPhiladelphia: John Benjamins; Gile, D., (1995) Regards Sur La Recherche En interprétation De conférence, , Lille: Presses Universitaires de Lille; Gile, D., Prospects and Challenges of Interdisciplinarity in Research on Conference Interpreting (1999) Proceedings of the 2Nd International Conference on Translation Studies, pp. 87-94. , National Taiwan Normal University: GITI; Gran, L., Dodds, J., (1989) The Theoretical and Practical Aspects Ofteaching Conference Interpretation, , Udine: Campanotto Editore; Gran, L., Taylor, C., (1990) Aspects of Applied and Experimental Research on Conference Interpretation, , Udine: Campanotto Editore; Gran, L., Riccardi, A., (1996) Nuovi Orientamenti Negli Studi sull’interpretazione., , SSLMIT Trieste; Gran, L., Viezzi, M., Development of Research Work at SSLM, Trieste (1995) Target, 7 (1), pp. 107-118; Kurz, I., (1996) Simultandolmetschen Als Gegenstand Der interdisziplinären Forschung, , Wien: Universitätsverlag; Lambert, S., Moser-Mercer, B., (1994) Bridging the Gap: Empirical Research in Simultaneous Interpretation, , Amsterdam-Philadelphia: John Benjamins; Massaro, D., Moser-Mercer, B., Editorial (1996) Interpreting 1:1. 1-6; Morris, R., (1993) Images of the Interpreter: A Study of Language-Switching in the Legal Process, , Department of Law, Lancaster University.

Yet, snags of a cultural character are just as detrimental to translation quality as are linguistic mistakes. The problem with cultural differences between source and target environments in translation is further aggravated by the fact that, in contrast with the finite number of linguistic differences between language systems, the range of variation in differences between cultural environments is virtually infinite. © 2000 John Benjamins B.V., Amsterdam.",,,,,,,,,"Bartsch, R., (1987) Norms of Language: Theoretical and Practical Aspects, , London and New York: Longman; Campbell, S., (1998) Translation into the Second Language, , London: Longman; Cassirer, E., (1944) An Essay on Man, , New Haven and London: Yale University Press.

It functions as a causal element in sociological theories, and as a methodological tool, when used extensionally. Most importantly, it is the concept which in some way structures the field which we take as our object of inquiry. As such, it has particular functions in serving as a basis for generalizations and as a means of determining category membership. In response to what are perceived as difficulties in some of these areas, some scholars have hinted that the concept of “translation” might be fruitfully viewed as a prototype category. In this paper, I review the philosophical and empirical arguments which support such a move, and outline some of the programmatic consequences. The focus is on the resolution of current conceptual problems, and on the theoretical and metatheoretical implications. © 1999 John Benjamins Publishing Company.",,,,,,,,,"Aitchison, J., (1994) Words in the Mind: An Introduction to the Mental Lexicon, , Oxford: Blackwell; Barsalou, L., The Instability of Graded Structure: Implications for the Nature of Concepts (1987) Concepts and Conceptual Development: Ecological and Intellectual Factors in Categorization, pp. 101-140. , Ulric Neisser, ed., Cambridge: Cambridge University Press; Bartsch, R., (1987) Norms of Language, , London: Longman; Bechtel, W., Connectionism and the Philosophy of Mind: An Overview (1990) Mind and Cognition: A Reader., pp. 252-273. , William Lycan, ed., Oxford: Blackwell1990; Berlin, B., (1968) Tzeltal Numeral Classifiers., , The Hague: Mouton; Berlin, B., Kay, P., (1969) Basic Color Terms: Their Universality and Evolution, , Berkeley: University of California Press; Berlin, B., Breedlove, D.E., Raven, P.H., (1974) Principles of Tzeltal Plant Classification, , New York: Academic; Brown, R., How Shall a Thing Be Called?

This paper presents a theoretical framework for studying the translation of comics as a social practice. On the premise that the production and reception of texts is dependent on their position and relative value in a given society, comics are first analyzed as a social phenomenon with the help of Bourdieu ’s theory of the cultural field. The translation-relevant elements of comics are then identified on the linguistic, typographic, and pictorial levels, and concepts of rhetoric are used to establish a classification of translation strategies which applies to both verbal and nonverbal textual material. Finally, a number of examples are discussed to highlight the diversity of translation strategies for the various elements of comics. © 1999 John Benjamins Publishing Company.",,,,,,,,,"(1988) Les Bidochon: Usagers De La Route., , Paris: Éditions Audie; (1990) Familie Fleischbauch — Autofreuden., , Nürnberg: Alpha-comic; Charlier, J.-M., Uderzo, A., (1963) L'École Des Aigles., , Paris: Dargaud.

The bulk of translations available in Philippine bookstores is imported ready-made from the U.S. and Britain, and it seems that, with these, local publishers import an Anglo-Saxon indifference towards translation from foreign languages. Local projects are very few and nearly all of them are translations into Filipino from Philippine originals written in Spanish, English and other vernacular languages. Fortunately, some projects point the way towards a use of translation as a catalyst that can pull together the country’s diverse genealogies and may help develop Filipino as a national language. Finally, difficulties in siting these domestic translations reveal an intriguing aspect of Manila’s post-colonial condition. © 1999 John Benjamins Publishing Company.",,,,,,,,,"Abad, G., Manlapaz, E., (1989) Man of Earth, , Quezon City: Ateneo de Manila U.P; Apostol, G., (1998) Personal Communication, , 6 April; Bassnett, S., Translation and Ideology (1991) Koinè, 1 (2), pp. 7-32; Bolasco, K.A., Publishing and Philippine Literature (1996) Paper Delivered at Conference on the Assessment of the State of Philippine Literature, , Theme: Contemporary Philippine Literature: Themes and Directions.

Also discussed are issues which have been seen as weaknesses in the model (e.g. the minimal reliance on textual evidence and the lack of a consistent methodology). A number of proposals, primarily informed by critical linguistics and contrastive rhetoric, are put forward in an attempt to fill some of the gaps.

Drawing from records of three peak periods of translation activities in China, some dating back to as early as the mid-2nd century, the author presents the case of China’s traditional reliance on foreign assistance in culturally important translation work, and argues that this was a direct result of the norms within mainstream Chinese culture. The article also explains how China’s translation tradition underwent a dramatic change at the turn of the 20th century, and the disruptive effects this has had on translation scholarship. © 1999 John Benjamins Publishing Company.",,,,,,,"96/181H","Research for this paper was part of the ""Translation in China: An Analytical project supported by the Hong Kong Research Grants Council (96/181H).","Shibang, C., (1990) Zhongguo Fojiao Yijingshi Lunji [Essays on Chinese Buddhist Sutra Translation], , Taipei: Dongchu; Cummins, J.S., (1993) A Question of Rites., , Aldershot, Hants: Scolar Press; Danne, G.H., (1962) Generations of Grants: The Story of Jesuits in China in The Last Decades of The Ming Dynasty., , Notre Dame, Indiana: University of Notre Dame Press; Gemet, J., (1985) China and the Christian Impact, , Oxford University Press; Gemet, J., (1995) Buddhism in Chinese Society: An Economic History from the 5Th to the 10Th Century, , New York: Columbia University Press; Yanjie, H., (1996) Yindu Fojiao Shi [A History of Indian Buddhism], , Taipei: Wenjin; (1959) The Life of Hsuan-Tsang, , tr.

This article proposes that difficulty can be tackled in terms of source text, translation task, and translator competence. Focussing on text difficulty, a case study is reported that shows that the source text can be an independent source of translation difficulty and that a substantial proportion of the items can be equally difficult to translate into typologically different languages. The study also highlights possible reasons for text difficulty at the level of lexis, and suggests that difficulty can be interpreted in cognitive terms, with the support of models of working memory and of language comprehension and production. © 1999 John Benjamins Publishing Company.",,,,,,,,"This project was supported by a University of Western Sydney Macarthur Internal Research Grant, and was carried out at the Language Acquisition Research Centre, University of Western Sydney Macarthur.

Eliot’s Four Quartets by the post-war Greek poet A. Decavalles challenges the hegemony of this major text of the Western canon. Four Quartets is considered an anti-local poem, expressing the desire for the creation of ""classic"" English, which presupposes a transcendental linguistic essence and a ""universal"" perspective. Decavalles evinces an active attitude towards translation both in his reference to it as ""re-creation "" and in his creation of a target text which is at points not fluent, and even problematic. The opacity of the rewriting of Four Quartets in Greek, a language of a peripheral European country, constitutes a political act of resistance to Western (modernist) hegemony as it undermines the metaphysical certainties of Eliot’s text. © 1999 John Benjamins Publishing Company.",,,,,,,,,"Eliot, T.S., (1952) Tessera Kouarteta (Four Quartets), , tr.

The paper focuses on a prototypical case of such translation problems: English cleft sentences and their counterparts in German. Clefts are claimed to establish a rhetorical relation with a propositional antecedent located beyond the local context, thus contributing to the formation of textual macro-structures. While the local context determines the focal interpretation of clefts within the current discourse, the appeal to earlier ideas attributes to the cleft a higher degree of contextual relevance. © 1999 John Benjamins Publishing Company.",,,,,,,,,"Abraham, W., Clausal Focus Versus Discourse Rhema in German: A Programmatic View (1992) Language and Cognition, 2, pp. 1-19; Andersson, S.-G., Zu Satzspaltung (Cleft) und Langer Extraktion in germanischen Sprachen (1993) Wortstellung Und Informations Struktur, pp. 39-61. , Marga Reis, ed., Tübingen: Narr, [Linguistische Arbeiten, 306.]; Bateson, G., (1979) Mind and Nature: A Necessary Unity., , Toronto, New York, London: Bantam; Bierwisch, M., (1963) Grammatik Des Deutschen Verbs., , Berlin: Deutsche Akademie der Wissenschaften.

In Section 1, the attempts in the current paper are related to linguistics and translation studies in general, and to the evaluation of translations in particular, arguing for a theoretically-based approach. A brief overview of the concept of register is also given. Sections 2, 3 and 4 cover the detailed analysis of the field, tenor and mode variables of the register of a translation, relating them critically to those of its source text. Section 5 argues that in addition to a 'register analysis, an evaluation of translations needs to take into account criteria based on comparative linguistics and language typology. Finally, it is suggested that a register-based approach links translation to co-generation under specific constraints, thus opening up the possibility of linking the translation quality to text quality in general. © 1998 John Benjamins Publishing Company.",,,,,,,,,"Baker, M., (1992) Other Words: A Coursebook on Translation, , London: Routledge; Bell, R.T., (1991) Translation and Translating: Theory and Practice, , London: Longman.

Acting is primarily conditioned by a ‘purpose’ and the nature of the intended addressees. The source text wording is of secondary importance. The functional skopos model allows the translator freedom to act as an expert and gives him responsibility for his approach.

An empirical paradigm gives central importance to testable hypotheses. Empirical research on translation profiles should result in a translation typology: One such typology is discussed. Translations have multiple causes, and we can already propose some possible causal laws. Three laws of translation effect are also proposed, and various parameters of effect are discussed, together with the associated problems of sampling and prescriptivism.

These features distinguish it from other sorts of language activity – intralingual paraphrasing, re-expressing of ideas, fictive quoting, speaking from a script, ghostwriting – and thus provide an object for a theory of translation production. The defining feature ‘quoting’ is taken to involve demonstrating to someone selected features of the source text. Thus the translational quoter is engaged in a dual activity: Quoting OF the source text (rendering work) and quoting TO the readers or listeners (pragmatic work). The texts commonly called translations arise from some combination of rendering, pragmatic and non-translational work. © 1998 John Benjamins Publishing Company.",,,,,,,,,"Bandia, P., Translation as Culture Transfer: Evidence from African Creative Writing (1993) TTR, 5 (2), pp. 55-77; Banfield, A., (1982) Unspeakable Sentences: Narration and Representation in the Language of Fiction, , Boston: Routledge; Berk-Seligson, S., (1990) The Bilingual Courtroom: Court Interpreters in the Judicial Process, , Chicago: University of Chicago Press; Bhaskar, R., (1978) A Realist Theory of Science, , 2nd ed.).

The current model of DTS could be reframed, or 'translated' in a topological sense, by giving it a slightly different slant on the assumption of a translating habitus understood as:(culturally) pre-structured and structuring agent mediating cultural artefacts in the course of transfer. A discussion of the translator’s endorsement of subservience is included, followed by a brief genealogy of the concept of habitus.

This paper builds on previous work firstly by exploring in detail the problem of author intention that appears to underlie the notion of effect. The discussion then extends into non-literary modes of translation where the translation specifications known as the Brief determine to a large extent the decisions taken by the translator. The author argues that the Brief introduces a crucial aspect into the decision-making process that not only allows for the possibility of compensation in non-literary texts but also influences the scope and type of compensation that would be deemed appropriate. Detailed examples are provided by a French source text featuring the frequent use of metaphor. Alternative translations are suggested in relation to two possible Briefs, which are presented as pedagogical devices in a translation 'role play'. © 1998 John Benjamins Publishing Company.",,,,,,,,,"Bell, A., Language Style as Audience Design (1984) Language in Society, 13, pp. 145-204; Crisafulli, E., Dantes Puns in English and the Question of Compensation (1996) The Translator, 2 (2), pp. 259-276; Eco, U., (1990) 1 Limiti Deltinterpretazione, , Milan: Bompiani; Foucault, M., What is an Author?

Besides its conventional role of hypothesis-testing, the latter can be exploratory. The main methodological problems in both are related to validity and representativeness and to quantification. At this stage, the most important contribution to interpreting research can be expected from observational procedures.

Out of modern linguistic theories, Cognitive Linguistics seems particularly promising. On the basis of Robert Frost’s poem “Nothing Gold Can Stay” and one of its Polish translations, the author demonstrates how intuitive interpretations and assessments are corroborated by a strictly linguistic analysis, which is carried out in the cognitivist vein. In particular, the interplay of two grammatical oppositions — between perfective and imperfective verb forms and between countable and mass nouns — is shown to be a means of direct sym-bolisation of meaning. Translation losses are then discussed — some unavoidable in view of systematic discrepancies between linguistic conventions, others a compromise imposed by the demands of versification. © 1997 John Benjamins Publishing Company.",,,,,,,,,"Cockiewicz Zwolski, W.I.H., (1982) Aspekt czasowniköw Polskich W Nauczaniu anglofonöw, , Krakow: Instytut Badan Polonijnych; Cockiewicz, W., (1992) Aspekt Na Tle Systemu slowotwörczego Polskiego Czasownika I Jego Funkcyjne Odpowiedniki W Jgzyku Niemieckim, , Krakow: Uniwersytet Jagiellonski; Gerber, P.L., (1982) Robert Frost, , Revised Edition.

This role was due to the remarkable status of German culture in the eyes of the Haskala (Jewish Enlightenment movement), and to the absence of appropriate original texts which could serve the needs of the new system. As a result, translated texts were privileged in the system of Jewish children’s literature, to the extent that, to the best of our knowledge, all books for children published by the Haskala in Germany were either official translations, pseudotranslations, or original texts based on existing German models. © 1997 John Benjamins Publishing Company.",,,,,,,,"This research project became possible primarily thanks to the support of the German Israeli Foundation (GIF).

Drawing on management literature, we identify two different perspectives on culture and language, and discuss their implications for translation and language learning. Within the first perspective of culture as a variable and language as representation, translation becomes a neutral act and language learning a technical skill. Within the second perspective of culture as a metaphor and language as action, translation becomes a managerial act and language learning a cultural production.

It is assumed that the pragmatic principle of Optimal Relevance and major grammatical parameters jointly determine language-specific processing conditions for an optimal distribution of information. The claims are illustrated by the German translation of a passage from an English novel, where the preferred translational variants meet different processing conditions in ‘right-peripheral’ German, as opposed to ‘left-peripheral’ English. The differences concern word order, including initial and final position in simple and complex sentences, and may have an impact on the semantic readings of formally similar sentence structures, which can require redistribution of information beyond sentence boundaries. © 1997 John Benjamins Publishing Company.",,,,,,,,,"Abraham, W., Clausal Focus Versus Discourse Rhema in German: A Program-matic View (1992) Language Und Cognition, 2, pp. 1-19; Altmann, G.T.M., Parsing and Interpretation: An Introduction (1989) Language and Cognitive Processes, 4 (3-4), pp. 1-19; Büring, D., (1995) The 59Th Street Bridge Accent: On the Meaning of Topic and Focus., , University of Tübingen.

In the interest of better understanding the various points of view, it seems helpful to consider different perspectives on this concept in light of the varying philosophical assumptions on which they are based. Analogies between the equivalence concept and a concept of scientific knowledge as it is and has been studied within the philosophy of science are highly informative in pointing out the philosophical issues involved in equivalence, translation, and knowledge. Rather than dismissing the concept as ill-defined or imprecise, it is in the interest of the field of translation studies to consider the origins and manifestations of this ‘imprecision’ in order that we may be better informed and less inclined towards theoretical antagonism. © 1997 John Benjamins Publishing Company.",,,,,,,,,"Van Den Broeck, R., Translation Theory after Deconstruction (1990) Translation Theory in Scandinavia: Proceedings from the Scandinavian Symposium on Translation Theory (SSOTTIII), pp. 24-57. , Oslo 11-13 August 1988, Oslo; Brown, J.R., (1994) Smoke and Mirrors: How Science Reflects Reality, , London: Routledge; Camp, K., The Translation of Pippi Longstocking into Dutch: A Test Case (1994) Robyns, 1994, pp. 19-47; Capelle, A., Translation in Nineteenth Century Belgium (1994) Robyns, pp. 7-16; Catford, J.C., (1965) A Linguistic Theory of Translation: An Essay in Applied Linguistics, , London: Oxford University Press; Chesterman, A., Theory in Translation Theory (1993) The New Courant, 1, pp. 69-79; Chesterman, A., (1989) Readings in Translation Theory, , Finland: Oy Finn Lectura Ab; Chesterman, A., Karl Popper in the Translation dass (1994) Teaching Translation and Interpreting 2: Insights, Aims, Visions.

Where issues of theoretical significance are raised, authors usually do not go beyond the prescriptive formulation of dos and don ’ts. Based on a classification of the various types of opera translation this paper outlines a theoretical framework of analysis based on the systematic investigation of the pragmatics of operatic production. Adopting a necessarily interdisciplinary approach, the author first explores the relationship between semiotics and translation studies. Then the semiotics of drama as modeled by Fischer-Lichte, who views operatic performance as text, is linked up with Holz-Manttari’s action-theoretical model of translation so as to account for all the various translation-relevant stages and agents of operatic productions. © 1997 John Benjamins Publishing Company.",,,,,,,,,"Bassnett-Mc Guire, S., (1991) Translation Studies., , Revised edition.

Box 48, Savonlinna, 57101, Finland","Owing to children’s developing reading skills and world knowledge, readability (comprehensibility as well as speakability) can be regarded as an important requirement of children’s literature. This article focusses on one determinant of readability, the frequency of nonflnite constructions in children’s books both originally written in Finnish and translated from English into Finnish. A high frequency of complex nonfinite constructions is likely to have a negative effect on readability, and consequently they might be expected to occur relatively infrequently both in original and in translated children’s literature. A quantitative study of a large number of children’s books shows that Finnish originals have indeed tended to favour finiteness, whereas translations show a higher degree of nonfiniteness. The translations thus fail to conform to one of the syntactic norms of the receiving literature. The article discusses potential reasons for this syntactic difference, considers the possibility of the existence of different sets of norms for translated and originally Finnish children’s books, and speculates upon the innovatory influence of translations. © 1997 John Benjamins Publishing Company.",,,,,,,,,"Baum, L.F., (1977) Ozin Velho, Tr.

After a brief descriptive analysis of the recipe genre in English and Spanish, student translations are examined. It is shown that the work of novice translators is one case in which source-language textual features are transferred into the target text. The effects of explicit instruction on textual features and text-typological conventions are examined by comparing student translations: a significant improvement in the work of students exposed to explicit instruction is indicative of the benefit of pedagogical intervention. The evidence presented also indicates that translation competence is in fact separate from bilingualism. © 1997 John Benjamins Publishing Company.",,,,,,,,,"Bowen, C., Spencer, J., (1985) Enciclopedia prâctica De La Repostena, , Madrid: Servagrup; Brown, G., Yule, G., (1983) Discourse Analysis, , Cambridge: Cambridge U.P; Colina, S., The Role of Translation in a Non-Translation Program (1994) Proceedings Ofthe ATA Annual Conference, pp. 351-360. , NJ: Leamed Information; Colina, S., An Introductory Course in Translation: Methodological and Peda-gogical Issues (1996) Encuentros En Tomo a La traducciön II: Una Realidad Interdisciplinar, pp. 45-51. , Carmen Valero Carcés, ed., Alcalâ de Henares: Universidad de Alcalâ, 1996; (1990) Betty Crocker’s Cookbook, , [No author.], New York: Golden Press; Day, H., (1970) The Complete Book Ofcurries, , The Cookery Book Club; De Antunano, G., Jesus, M., (1995) Con Mucho Gusto: Menüs Completos De Maria Jesus Gil De Antunano, , Madrid: Ediciones el Pafs; Givön, T., (1983) Topic Continuity in Discourse, , Amsterdam-Philadelphia: John Benjamins; Eggington, W., Written Académie Discourse in Korean: Implications for Effective Communication in Writing Across Languages (1987) Writing across Languages: Analysis Ofl2 Text, pp. 153-168. , Ulla Connor and Robert Kaplan, eds., Massachusetts: Adison; Haegeman, L., Register Variation in English: Some Theoretical Observations (1987) Journal of English Linguistics, 20 (2), pp. 230-248; Harris, B., La traductologie, la traduction naturelle, la traduction automatique et la sémantique (1973) Cahiers De Linguistique, 10. , (no page numbers); Harris, B., The Importance of Natural Translation (1977) Working Papers on Bilin-Gualism, 12, pp. 96-114; Hatim, B., Mason, I., (1990) Discourse and the Translator, , London and New York: Longman; Hinds, J., Contrastive Rhetoric: Japanes and English (1983) Text, 3 (2), pp. 183-195; House, J., Blum-Kulka, S., (1986) Interlingual and Intercultural Com-Munication: Discourse and Cognition in Translation and Second Language Acquisition Studies, , Tübingen: Gunter Narr; Honig, H.G., Wissen Übersetzer eigentlich, was sie tun?

Operatic scholarship has voiced different views on the fusion of verbal and musical discourse, the two extremes being logocentrism and musicocentrism. The interlingual translation of the verbal subtext is a complex enterprise subject to multiple constraints. By focusing on its intricacies in some detail (the anatomy of the human vocal apparatus, high/ low pitches, stress, prosodic and intonational patterns, rhyme, etc., together determining the singability of the libretto), I hope that the discussion will shed light on the manifold problems involved in opera translation.

The dominant ideology in the material is what could be called religious-conservative ideology, emphasizing the thought content of the works and their (educative, civilizing, sometimes also entertaining) impact on readers. This is due to the ideological unification process that penetrated the cultural institutions, which were still relatively undifferentiated and non-autonomous during the period in Finland.

It inquires into the linguistic strategies and resources that translators from English into Arabic fall back on when encountering passive utterances. It is shown that translators employ many strategies with this order of frequency: nominalization, adjectivalization, passivization, activization and pseudo-activization. It is also shown that the claim that Arabic does not tolerate agentive passives is inadequate, since Arabic translators use a variety of formal markers in translating English agentive passives. Thus, the study demonstrates that English passivization is predominantly structure-based, whereas Arabic passivization is predominantly semantics-based. © 1996 John Benjamins Publishing Company.",,,,,,,,,"Al-Najjar, M.F., (1984) Translation as a Correlative of Meaning, , Bloomington: Indiana University.

Analysis of two translations representing different types of report (clinical and experimental) showed that use of three references offered greater certainty than using three specialized dictionaries: 71% and 51 % of items were found by the two methods, respectively. A combined method improved coverage to between 85% and 90%, and could guarantee acceptability for 95% of the items. As instances of parallel texts, references provided more and better information than dictionaries, especially at the higher sentence and text levels, as well as giving insight into stylistic aspects of lexical choice for the genre. © 1996 John Benjamins Publishing Company.",,,,,,,,,"(1971) Collins Spanish-English English-Spanish Dictionary, , Colin Smith et al.

These 'natural laws' of communication give rise to implicit information and are responsible for its special characteristics, such as graded strength of communication and its correlates, including poetic effects. They furthermore determine the interdependence of text, context and successful communication, and limit communicability in incompatible contexts. One important contextual factor consists in what kind of interpretive resemblance the audience expects between translation and original. The ultimate test for a translation is whether or not it achieves with the target audience what the translator intended it to achieve, rather than whether it conforms to some translation-theoretical notion of equivalence. © 1996 John Benjamins Publishing Company.",,,,,,,,,"Adams, R.M., (1973) Proteus, His Lies, His Truth: Discussions of Literary Translation, , New York: Norton; Grice, H.P., Logic and Conversation (1975) Philosophy of Language, pp. 159-170. , Reprinted in A.P.

We also illustrate some differences in using function words in the two languages, and analyze how they may affect translation. The logical nature of modification enables us to identify and observe internal modifiers within the meaning structure of a word, as against sentence and word modifiers as external modifiers.

Within the framework of cognitive semantics, it is argued that translation is an instance of conceptual metaphor, whereby conceptual structures of the target language are mapped onto the source text in order to make it understood by the TL reader. The relevance of this position for the study of translation becomes obvious when considered against existing practices in professional and nonprofessional translating. Thus, the directionality from target to source is experimentally shown to correlate with another type of directionality, namely, translating from or into one's mother tongue, and can explain observable facts in the performance of translation tasks. © 1996 John Benjamins Publishing Company.",,,,,,,,,"Baker, M., (1992) In Other Words: A Coursehook on Translation, , London and New York: Routledge; Broeck, R.V.D., (1986) Contrastive Discourse Analysis as a Tool for the Interpretation of Shifts in Translated Texts, pp. 37-47. , House and Blum-Kulka 1986; Chesterman, A., From ‘Is to ‘Ought’: Laws, Norms and Strategies in Translation Studies” (1993) Target, 5 (1); Dendrinos, B., (1992) The EFL, pp. 1-20. , Athens: N.C.

Taking as a point of departure the hypothesis that translated texts have to “function” in the target situation for which they are produced by serving the purpose(s) they are intended for (which may or may not be the “same” as those of the source text), it is argued that the translator has to reconcile the conditions of functionality prevailing in the target culture with the communicative intentions of the source-title sender (= functionality + loyalty). The discussion of several examples from an extensive corpus of German, French, English, and Spanish titles and their translations shows how this methodological approach can be put into practice, establishing a model for the functional translation of other texts and text-types. © 1995 John Benjamins Publishing Company.",,,,,,,,,"Beaugrande, R.A.D., Dressier, W.U., (1981) Einführung in Die Textlinguistik, , Tübingen: Niemeyer; Genette, G., (1982) Palimpsestes: La littérature Au Second degré, , Paris: Seuil; Hoek, L.H., (1981) La Marque Du Titre: Dispositifs sémiotiques D'une Pratique Textuelle, , La Haye-Paris-New York: Mouton.

Without reference to a common theoretical framework, the results obtained when analysing individual texts cannot be compared — making it impossible to relate the individual text types to each other, and thus determine the scope of validity of the features which turn out to be characteristic of a group of texts. For this reason, an approach towards a pragmatic text typology is presented which can serve as a framework for the analysis of various LSP text types.

Moreover, her personal experience as an interpreter was sometimes at odds with some of the ideas expressed in interpretation literature.

I.e. translations must be identified and described sui generis as the results of a textprocessing activity. From the linguistic and text-theoretical perspective this objective is fulfilled by the concept of equivalence; a translation is defined as a secondary text that stands in an equivalence relation to a primary text. The range of the equivalence-oriented approach and the possibilities it offers for systematic description and explanation of translational phenomena are, however, limited. Its problems and limitations become apparent not only in the context of historical translation research, but also whenever interest focusses upon the text-productive — i.e. ultimately creative — aspect of translation, as opposed to its reproductive aspect, i.e. the linguistic-textual relationships between languages and texts as these are deduced from regularities. © 1995 John Benjamins Publishing Company.",,,,,,,,,"Albrecht, J., 1987. “Einführung (1987) Albrecht, pp. 3-9; Albrecht, J., (1987) Translation Und Interkulturelle Kommunikation, , Frankfurt a.M.-Bern: Peter Lang.

Actual translatorial practice in Finland, judging by seven translations of novels, favours the strategy of minimum change. This low-effort strategy is useful when allusions are transcultural, but will often lead to flat translations and loss of connotations in the case of unfamiliar allusions, even resulting in a failure to convey the message, as evidenced by reader responses. Adoption of a more creative and reader-oriented translatorial role would offer a wider variety of translation strategies and lead to a decrease of “culture bumps” in translations. © 1994 John Benjamins Publishing Company.",,,,,,,,,"Archer, C.M., (1986) Culture Bump and Beyond., pp. 170-178. , J.M.

Attention to its political dimension suggests that it should not be attached to the state-subsidized work carried out under Alfonso X after 1250 but is better explained in terms of Cluniac sponsorship of the first Latin translation of the Qur’an in 1142. This approach reveals grounds for potential conflict between the foreign scientific translators and the Toledo cathedral. Such conflict would nevertheless have been smoothed over by certain translation principles serving both scientific and religious interests. The foremost of these principles were literalism, secondary elaboration, the use of teamwork, the inferiorization of non-Latinist intermediaries, justification of conquest and the accordance of authority to non-Christian texts. Thanks to this shared regime, the Church helped scientific translations to enter Latin. But the translations brought with them a questioning spirit that would contest and eventually undermine Church authority. © 1994 John Benjamins Publishing Company.",,,,,,,"Alexander von Humboldt-Stiftung","This research was made possible by a much-appreciated fellowship from the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation for work carried out at the Sonderforschungsbereich 309 ""Die literarische Übersetzung"", Georg-August Universität Gottingen.

Structural semantics, more specifically semantic feature analysis, has given rise to the maxim that we should translate “bundles of semantic featuresPrototype semantics suggests that word-meanings have cores and fuzzy edges which are influenced by culture. For translation this means that we do not necessarily translate bundles of features but have to decide whether to focus on the core or the fuzzy edges of the meaning of a particular word. Scenes- and-frames semantics suggests that word meaning is influenced by context and the situation we are in. Word-meaning is thus not static but dynamic, and it is this dynamism which should govern our decisions as translators. © 1994 John Benjamins Publishing Company.",,,,,,,,,"Amtz, R., Terminologievergleich und internationale Terminologieangleich-ung (1986) Snell-Homby, pp. 283-310; Diller, H.-J., Komelius, J., (1978) Linguistische Problème Der Über- Setzung, , Tübingen: Niemeyer; Fillmore, C.J., (1976) Frame Semantics and the Nature of Language, pp. 20-32. , J.

This partial rejection of French role as mediators may be attributed to the developing German target literature as well as to developments within French literature itself.

The situation in Denmark is not typical for a variety of reasons: the Grimms had close personal contacts with prominent Danes. Culturally their Tales belonged to a distant pangermanic tradition common to Danes and Germans. Therefore the first volume of tales (1812) was soon translated into Danish. The initial high esteem is felt to this day as a strong tradition of ‘respectable and faithful translations’. Yet changes in market forces and reading audiences have created two more strata in the translational heritage of the Grimm Tales in Danish. The Grimm tradition has also responded to changes in Danish middle-class perception of Germany. © 1993 John Benjamins Publishing Company.",,,,,,,,,"(1912) ADB — Allgemeine Deutsche Bibliographie, , Berlin: Duncker and Humblot.

Translation has mainly been discussed within a product-oriented framework.The more process-oriented approaches of recent years have taken notice of reading as a component activity of the translation process. However, few empiricalstudies have been completed which address the role of reading in translation.The way a person reads, and the result of that reading (some sort of mental representation of the text or text segment), will depend on the reader’s purposes andmotivations. The present empirical study indicates that while the translator’sreading of a text may be to some extent more thorough and deliberate than thatof an ordinary reader, it is not likely to be markedly so. The study also indicatesa significant variability in the way translators “read for translation”.

It is read by Sephardic Jewry from Passover to Pentecost a chapter aweek, and has been translated into Ladino, the Judeo-Spanish calque-type language, in a variety of places since 1552. The article focuses on the morphological aspects of the translations. The results show that whereas Ladino translatorsopted for literal translations of the Biblical verses, they adopted freer renditionsof the less sacred Mishnaic text.

Haverschmidtlaan 60, Schiedam, 3116 JN, Netherlands","Due to the influence of rhetoric, Dutch translation theory between 1750 and 1820, like translation theory in other Western European countries inthose days, was primarily concerned with the effect of a translation on the Dutchpublic and the verbal appearance of the Dutch version. This functionalapproach was reinforced by the definition of translation as interpretatio, imitatio or exercitatio. The translational technique which follows from thisprospective orientation is one of adaptation, correction and improvement. Bythe end of the period, Dutch translation theory seemed to be moving awayslowly from the rhetorical tradition, as a result of two major changes: (1) agrowing concern as of ± 1780 for fidelity to the verbal aspects of the originalwithin the interpretatio-approach, and (2) a decrease in the popularity ofimitatio as a creative technique after 1800. Unlike Germany, translation theoryin The Netherlands had not made the crucial step towards a new theory of language before 1820. © 1993 John Benjamins Publishing Company.",,,,,,,,,"Apel, F., (1982) Sprachtewegung: Eine Historisch-Poetologische Untersuchung Zum Problem Des Übersetzens, , Heidelberg: Winter; D’Hulst, L., Le discours sur la traduction en France (1800-1850) (1989) Revue De littérature comparée, 63 (2), pp. 179-187; D’Hulst, L., (1990) Cent Ans De théorie française De La Traduction: De Batteux à Littré, pp. 1748-1847. , Lille: Presses universitaires de Lille; Dockhorn, K., (1968) Macht Und Wirkung Der Rhetorik: Vier Aufsätze Zur Ideengeschichte Der Vormoderne, , Bad Homburg: Verlag Gehlen; France, P., (1972) Rhetoric and Truth in France: Descartes to Diderot, , Oxford: Clarendon Press; Hermans, T., Van ‘Hebban olla vogala tot Ernst van Altena: Literaire vertaling en Nederlandse literatuurgeschiedenis (1988) Literatuur Van Elders, pp. 11-25. , Raymond van den Broeck, ed, Leuven: Acco, 1988; Howell, W.S., (1971) Eighteenth-Century British Logic and Rhetoric, , Princeton: Princeton University Press; Huber, T., (1968) Studien Zur Theorie Des Übersetzens Im Zeitalter Der Deutsche Aufklärung, pp. 1730-1770. , Meisenheim am Glan: Verlag Anton Hain; Kelly, L.G., The True Interpreter: A History of Translation (1979) Theory and Practice in the West, , Oxford: Basil Blackwell; Knufmann, H., Übersetzungswesen des 18.

Four areas are used to draw evidence for this cultural barrier: death terms, discourse conditionals, tautological expressions, and proverbial expressions. In most cases, the translator is forced to adopt functional equivalents, despite the fact that fatalism is missed in the functionally corresponding expressions. © 1993 John Benjamins Publishing Company.",,,,,,,,,"Berofsky, B., (1971) Determinism, , Princeton: Princeton University Press; Catford, J.C., (1965) A Linguistic Theory of Translation: An Essay in Applied Linguistics, , London: Oxford University Press; Waard, J., Nida, E.A., (1986) From One Language to Another: Functional Equivalence in Bible Translating, , Nashville: Thomas Nelson Publishers; Farghal, M., Colloquial Jordanian Arabic Tautologies (1992) Journal of Pragmatics, 17 (3), pp. 223-240; Farghal, M., Ideational Equivalence in Translation, [forthcoming] Kachru, Y. 1982 (1992) Toward Defining the Notion ‘Equivalence in Contrastive Analysis”, pp. 82-98. , TESL5.

Next followed a period when foreign texts were imported with the aim of developing modern Korean literature.

Of special interest for the cultural history of the 19th century are literary landscapes, enabling translation scholars who deal with different literatures to collaborate on a limited textual basis. Alterations of a literary ‘leitmotiv’ can effect considerable shifts on all levels of the target-text, e.g., content, point of view and overall thematic structure. It seems very likely that the findings gained from comparative analysis of novel-translations do also apply to other literary forms and that they can be regarded as “translational constants” in a cultural history of literary translation. © 1992 John Benjamins Publishing Company.",,,,,,,,,"Gerull-Kardas, R., (1958) GrófiéErwartungen, , Übers, Berlin(-Ost): Verlag NeuesLeben; Heichen, P., (1895) Grófié Erwartungen, , Übers, Charles Dickens' sämtliche Romane undErzählungen (34 Bde.), 20.

This paper argues that it is the function of the translation, and not the functions of language or the function of the source text, that is the translator’s guiding force. Having defined the function of translation as the application or use which the translation is intended to have in the context of the target situation, various functions that a literary translation may serve are examined. Finally, using the criteria of functions of language, functions of (source) text and functions of translation, an attempt is made to show that the type and degree of coincidence between the formal manifestations of the functions of language in the source text, the function of the source text and the translation depend on the precise function of the latter. © 1992 John Benjamins Publishing Company.",,,,,,,,,"Blais, J., (1981) Andrė Gide Et La Traduction, , Ottawa: University of Ottawa.

Skilled translating consists notof following rules or algorithms of equivalence, but of generating coincidencesbetween the materials of the source language and those of the target language.Conventional aspirations of linguistic theory emphasize degrees of generality, uniformity and formality, which such an activity does not readily seem to fit.Also, language science and linguistics have consistently rated form over meaning and language system over communicative context, while translation is anactivity in which meaning dominates over form, and context immediately controls and influences how the language system is used. Recent approaches to textand discourse are now striving to revise traditional theoretical aspirations inorder to attain better models of language use, and may thus provide a basis forunifying theory with practice in translation. © 1991 John Benjamins Publishing Company.",,,,,,,,,"Shattuck, W., (1961) The Craft and Context of Translation, , Austin: University of Texas Press; de Beaugrande, R., (1978) Factors in a Theory of Poetic Translating, , Assen: van Gorcum; de Beaugrande, R., (1980) Text, Discourse, and Process, , Norwood, N.J.: Ablex; de Beaugrande, R., Text and Discourse in European Research (1980) Discourse Processes, 3, pp. 287-300; de Beaugrande, R., (1984) Text Production; de Beaugrande, R., Text Linguistics (1984) Handbook of Discourse Analysis, pp. 41-70. , London: Academic; de Beaugrande, R., Linguistics as Discourse: A Case Study from Semantics (1984) Word, 35, pp. 15-57; de Beaugrande, R., Translation as Text Processing (1987) LSP-ALSED Newsletter, 10 (1), pp. 2-22; de Beaugrande, R., (1988) Critical Discourse: A Survey of Contemporary Literary Theorists, , Norwood, N.J.: Ablex; de Beaugrande, R., Comparing Texts in Different Languages (1988) Studien Zur Sprachkonfrontation: Materialien Der I.

A short news item, which displays world knowledge fairlyimplicitly in condensed lexical forms, was translated by students from Englishinto German. It is shown that their translation strategies changed from a firstdraft which was rather close to the surface structure of the source text to a finalversion which took situational aspects, texttypological conventions and the different background knowledge of the respective addressees into account. Decisions on how much world knowledge has to be made explicit in the target text, however, must be based on the relevance principle.

Each book relates an adventurous episode in which the principal character is Astérix, a small, witty warrior from a fictional Gaulish vil-lage, the only village to have successfully resisted the Roman occupation. The series relies on many humorous techniques, but word-play and puns form an integral part. Much humour derives from the names used, combining various comic effects, particularly puns and double entendres. Thus the translator faces not only the usual problems in translating literary names, but also the problem of retaining these comic effects. This paper examines these problems and their solutions, based on a complete collection of name data from all 30 books in 4 languages (French original; English, German, Finnish translations), with numerous references to translations into other languages. © 1991 John Benjamins Publishing Company.",,,,,,,,,"Anttila, R., Finnish Affective Vocabulary: An(other) Invitation (1975) Ural- Altaische Jahrbücher Al, pp. 10-19; Anttila, R., Sananmuunnoksista ja spoonerismeista: ‘Pietari Suuri hattunsa polki (1989) Virittäjä, 19 (3), pp. 370-379; Gläser, R., Zur Übersetzbarkeit von Eigennamen (1976) Linguistische Arbeitsberichte (Leipzig), 13, pp. 12-25; Grassegger, H., (1985) Sprachspiel Und Übersetzung: Eine Studie Anhand Der Comicserie Asterix, , Tübingen: Stauffenburg; Hartmann, R., Betrachtungen zur arabischen Version von Asterix.

In German translations, this is generally reduced to a uniform way of formulating sentences. Point of view, however, which finds linguistic expression in Japanese as well as in Western languages, is respected in German translations. The present article takes up some linguistic indications of point of view in Japanese, most of the examples being drawn from Kawabata’s Yukiguni and BenTs German translation of it. A consistent finding is that the German translation tends toward a more objectivating way of narration alongside greater linguistic explicitness. This may be related to the linguistic signalling of personhood in Japanese and the role of personhood in Japanese culture. Thus, the present article puts forward the hypothesis that German translations of Japanese novels may tend to deflect traits of Japanese culture in the direction of the receiving culture. © 1990 John Benjamins Publishing Company.",,,,,,,,,"Broeck, R.V.D., (1978) The Concept of Equivalence in Translation Theory, pp. 29-47. , Holmes, Lambert and van den Broeck, 1978; Broeck, R.V.D., Contrastive Discourse Analysis as a Tool for the Interpretation of Shifts in Translated Texts (1986) House and Blum-Kulka, pp. 37-47; Holmes, I., The Position of Translated Literature in the Literary Polysystem (1978) Holmes, Lambert and Van Den Broeck, pp. 117-127. , (Rep. in Itamar Even-Zohar.

Most kinds of translation can be analysed as varieties of interpretive use. I distinguish direct from indirect translation. Direct translation corresponds to the idea that translation should convey the same meaning as the original. It requires the receptors to familiarise themselves with the context envisaged for the original text. The idea that the meaning of the original can be communicated to any receptor audience, no matter how different their background, is shown to be a misconception based on mistaken assumptions about communication. Indirect translation involves looser degrees of resemblance. Direct translation is merely a special case of interpretive use, whereas indirect translation is the general case. In all cases the success of the translation depends on how well it meets the basic criterion for all human communication, which is consistency with the principle of relevance. Thus the different varieties of translation can be accounted for without recourse to typologies of texts, translations, functions or the like. © 1990 John Benjamins Publishing Company.",,,,,,,,,"Beekman, J., Callow, J., (1974) Translating the Word of God, p. 1. , Grand Rapids, ich.: Zondervan; Blakemore, D., (1987) Semantic Constraints on Relevance, , Oxford: Blackwell; Chukovskii, K., (1984) The Art of Translation, Tr, , Lauren G.

These were usually characterized by strong interference of that language. In the system of canonized literature, on the contrary, linguistic interference in translations from English was rather restricted. The gap between the two systems in this respect gradually narrowed during the 1970s. The dynamics in translated literature as regards the interference of English may be explained as deriving from processes of change in Israeli culture and in its redeployment with respect to the West, especially with respect to American culture. © 1990 John Benjamins Publishing Company.",,,,,,,,,"Anderson, S., (1982) Aharon Amir.

In the first part a short sketch of the development of our understanding of metaphors is presented. It is shown that this understanding has expanded by the successive inclusion of a number of components, rendering it increasingly more complex. The second part proceeds from the translation of Spanish and French texts into German, and documents the various possibilities for translating metaphors. The particular solutions supplied by the translators are compared with one another and evaluated. This procedure forms the basis for the third part, which investigates the possible consequences of all this for the science of translation: what status do metaphors have in this science, and in what way could they possibly be systematically integrated into research in the field. © 1990 John Benjamins Publishing Company.",,,,,,,,,"Beneke, J., Metaphorik in Fachtexten (1988) Textlinguistik Und Fachsprache: Akten Des Internationalen übersetzungswissenschaftlichen AILA- Symposions Hildesheim, 13, pp. 16-197. , Reiner Arntz, ed, April 1987.

The method is based on the premise that both micro- and macrostructural shifts in translation can furnish indications of the translational norms adopted by the translator, his interpretation of the original text and the strategy applied during the process of translation. In the first installment of the article (Target 1:2) the first component of the method was discussed, a comparative model for the classification of microstructural shifts. In addition, the theoretical basis of the second component, the descriptive model, was presented, focusing on the effects of microstructural shifts on the macrostructural level. The second installment gives a detailed explanation of the descriptive model (Section 4) and a brief account of the results which were obtained when the method was applied. © 1990 John Benjamins Publishing Company.",,,,,,,,,"Saavedra, C., De, M., (1967) (1605/1615).

A set of criteria was defined, against which the quality of a given unit of translation can be measured. These criteria provide a framework within which a mathematical model is constructed. It takes the fuzzy subset theory as its theoretical basis, trying to solve the problem of translation quality assessment by an approach which might be called analysis-synthesis fuzzy evaluation. Mathematical operations can be performed with the aid of a computer program to yield a grade of membership which indicates the quality of a given translation. The model proposed in this paper is, therefore, of methodological significance. © 1990 John Benjamins Publishing Company.",,,,,,,,,"Dubois, D., Prade, H., (1980) Fuzzy Sets and Systems: Theory and Applications, , New York: Academic Press; Fan, S., Fuzzy Set Theory and Evaluation of Translation.

The present article takes up 20th century Japanese novels and their translations into German. As areas of typological differences, movement verbs and causatives in describing human bodily reactions have been selected. Japanese lexicalizes the path a movement takes in a monomorphemic verbal base, whereas German lexicalizes the manner of movement. It is shown that this typological difference creates a tendency to substitute German manner for Japanese path verbs. As a morphological example a specific use of causatives is discussed. In descriptions of bodily reactions Japanese causatives tend to be ambiguous as to an intentional or unintentional interpretation. German, having few morphological causatives and no similar ambiguous expression, tends to level the ambiguities towards an objective description. In a second installment syntax and narrative technique will be considered. © 1990 John Benjamins Publishing Company.",,,,,,,,,"Barry, R., Topic in Chinese: An Overlap of Meaning, Grammar, and Discourse Function (1975) Papers from the Parasession on Functionalism, pp. 1-9. , Robin E.
