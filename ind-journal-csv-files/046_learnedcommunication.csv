These pressures emanate from contexts with different, often competing, social norms, which result in academics publishing for reasons that may run counter to accepted scientific practice. This paper asks what decisions are being taken by academics when it comes to their choice of scholarly book publisher. An analysis of books selected from more than 2,500 self-reported scholarly publications produced by academics at Makerere University in Uganda from 2011 to 2017 shows that 31 scholarly books were published. Of these books, more than half (54%) were published by publishers that do not follow accepted scholarly publishing practice. Findings also show that there was a sharp decline in books published with suspect publishers in the second half of the 7-year period. The article discusses possible reasons for the selection of suspect publishers and considers four factors that may account for the observable decline: (1) a cyclical downturn, (2) improved research management and reporting, (3) explication of the norms of science, and (4) self-correction.

The main results are as follows. Quantitatively, the absolute total number of articles published by Chinese universities has increased. Specifically, the number of international publications in the natural and social sciences from double first-class universities showed an increasing trend, but the number of domestic journal articles showed the reverse trend. Moreover, based on the number of papers published by each university over the years, we recognized that the ranking changes of universities fall into four categories: rising, declining, stable, and fluctuating. Qualitatively, the international and domestic publications issued by double first-class universities greatly improved from 2006 to 2018. Moreover, scientific publications, either international or domestic, were unevenly distributed among the double first-class universities. In general, the double first-class universities developed rapidly in recent years and play an important role in the development of science and technology in China.

For the study, we surveyed 490 authors who published their work in library and information science journals and performed an exploratory factor analysis. The analysis identified five underlying components of journal selection criteria consisting of 15 items, which were labelled prestige, readership, peer review, infrastructure, and performance. The five components were positively related to each other, and peer review was shown as the most important component in choosing a publication venue, followed by readership, prestige, infrastructure, and performance. The results of this study will help increase the understanding of authors' publishing behaviours and will help journal publishers and editors improve their journals by developing strategies that attract better-quality manuscripts. © 2020 The Author(s).

This model originates in the field of blockchain and cryptoeconomics and is essentially a decentralized system where tokens (digital currency) are used to incentivize quality curation of information. TCR is an automated way to create lists of any kind where decisions (whether to include N or not) are made through voting that brings benefit or loss to voters. In an academic journal, TCR could act as a tool to introduce community-driven decisions on papers to be published, thus encouraging more active participation of authors/reviewers in editorial policy and elaborating the idea of a journal as a club. TCR could also provide a novel solution to the problems of editorial bias and the lack of rewards/incentives for reviewers. In the paper, we discuss core principles of TCR, its technological and cultural foundations, and finally analyse the risks and challenges it could bring to scholarly publishing.

Revenues accruing to UK publishers from rights sales has increased by over 22% in the past 5 years. The recent and controversial European Union Copyright Directive and Brexit will undoubtedly impact selling rights, but as yet, we do not know what that impact will be. Technology plays a role both in changing the kinds of rights being licensed and in helping the management of rights sales to be carried out more efficiently. It is vital that rights metadata is developed and implemented to ensure improved efficiency in rights management. Rights Management Practice will need to evolve in response to the climate emergency. © 2020 The Author(s).Learned Publishing © 2020 ALPSP.",,,,,,,,,,,"O'Leary, B., Fakundiny, M., (2019), http://bisg.org, 27 September).

Equally, the many methods suggested to determine trustworthiness are not reliable because they include questionable criteria. The question arises whether valid criteria for identifying an untrustworthy journal can be determined and whether other assessment procedures are necessary. Since 2017, the Masaryk University Campus Library has been developing a suitable evaluation method for journals. A list of 19 criteria based on those originally suggested by Beall, COPE, DOAJ, OASPA, and WAME were reduced to 10 objectively verifiable criteria following two workshops with librarians. An evaluation of 259 biomedical journals using both the list of 19 and then 10 criteria revealed that 74 journals may have been incorrectly assessed as untrustworthy using the longer list. The most common reason for failure to comply was in the provision of sufficient editorial information and declaration of article processing charges. However, our investigation revealed that no criteria can reliably identify predatory journals. Therefore, a complex evaluation is needed combining objectively verifiable criteria with analysis of a journal's content and knowledge of the journal's background.

Although achieving public access was simple in principle, it required considerable effort to develop systems that satisfied all parties. Publishers had been working with federal agencies to achieve open access before the 2013 White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, but this helped to create a path for a more fruitful relationship.

An estimated 4,000 Australian academics (ca. 7% of the academic population) are on these journal boards. Of the publishers, 240 proved to be overtly fraudulent, the ethical status of the others remaining unresolved. About 86% of the Australian academics identified appeared on the editorial boards of journals belonging to those 240 publishers. Despite two decades of advocacy from librarians, there remains widespread ignorance of the existence of such fraudulent publishers, and more severe action is required. Reform proposals include naming the publisher in all references and in academic profiles and curriculum vitae. Universities are encouraged to take responsibility for publishing journals that replace those currently causing the problem. Institutions are urged to augment their current warnings and advice with formal policies, which will probably require a blacklist of unacceptable publishers. New formal policies for dealing with predatory publishers are currently being developed in some Australian universities.

Research outputs destined for audiences beyond academia are also increasingly valued by funders, end users, and tertiary institutions. While there is an expectation that ECRs may create diverse research outputs for an array of audiences, the kinds of research output texts produced by ECRs for varied audiences warrants further investigation. In addition, the routes of dissemination that ECRs use to share their academic research outputs to secure impact beyond academia are not well understood. Drawing on semi-structured interviews of 30 respondents in Australia and Japan, we explore the research-sharing practices of ECRs, finding that ECRs may potentially create a wide range of research-informed texts for end users beyond academia, using an array of methods for dissemination. The examples of the output text types and dissemination routes we provide in this paper can be used to inspire ECRs and also more senior academics to share their research more broadly, and perhaps more effectively, and can be used by publishers to improve research impact and support ECRs' research translation.

It can potentially destroy the reputation of an institution. Only a few studies have explored plagiarism in Saudi Arabia, and these have focused on academic institutions. Therefore, in this study, we investigated the attitudes of researchers towards plagiarism at a tertiary care hospital in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, using the established Attitudes Towards Plagiarism questionnaire. The questionnaire contains demographic data along with 29 statements divided into three sections: positive attitude towards plagiarism, which reflects the approval and acceptance of plagiarism (12 items); negative attitude towards plagiarism, which reflects deprecation and condemnation of plagiarism (7 items); and subjective norms towards plagiarism, which reflects personal perception of the extent and acceptance of plagiarism in society (10 items). Responses were collected from 237 participants. The overall attitudes of researchers showed a disapproval for plagiarism in medical research but also revealed some ambiguity about self-plagiarism and a belief that others were more likely to plagiarize than the respondent. Our findings suggest that awareness about different forms of plagiarism among researchers should be increased. We recommend that researchers' attitudes towards plagiarism should be investigated further in a rigorous association study.

The ethical approval for this study was obtained from the Institutional Review Board (IRB) at KFMC. All KFMC researchers who were listed in the IRB study list or KFMC grant list were eligible to participate in this study. The participants were selected randomly from the lists and invited to participate in this study by a trained research coordinator. The data were collected using a validated, self-administered questionnaire. The questionnaire consisted of two sections. The first section included demographic data, and the second section included the Attitudes Towards Plagiarism (ATP) questionnaire developed and validated by Mavrinac, Brumini, Bilic-Zulle, and Petrovecki (). This questionnaire was used with permission and without any modifications. The questionnaire was designed to be used as a standardized tool for measuring attitudes towards plagiarism in future research (Mavrinac et al.,). The questionnaire was based on the theory of planned behaviour with 29 items. The survey questionnaire (statements) is divided into three sections: positive attitude (i.e. supporting plagiarism), negative attitude (i.e. criticizing plagiarism), and subjective norms (i.e. their views on the extent and acceptance of plagiarism in society). The positive attitude section has 12 statements analysing participants' self-measurement of positive attitudes towards plagiarism. The score range of this section is 12?60; scores between 12 and 28 are favourable and indicate a low tolerance towards plagiarism. However, a high score from 48 to 60 reflects approval and acceptance of plagiarism. The negative attitude section has seven statements to measure disapproval of plagiarism with a score range of 7?35; scores between 27 and 35 reflect disapproval and no tolerance of plagiarism, while a low score between 7 and 16 reflects acceptance of plagiarism. The subjective norm section has 10 statements with a score range of 10?50, which reflects the individual's perception, recognition, and acceptance of plagiarism. Scores between 10 and 23 indicate low subjective norms and, hence, personal unacceptability or disapproval of plagiarism. Responses to all statements are scaled on a 5-point Likert scale: 1 ?strongly disagree, 2 ?disagree?, 3 ?neither agree nor disagree?, 4 ?agree?, and 5 ?strongly agree? (Mavrinac et al.,). The questionnaires were distributed by the research coordinator. The sample size was calculated using Cochran's method with parameters of 95% confidence interval, 5% marginal error, 50% assumed level of participant's knowledge and attitude towards plagiarism, and a population size of 580; it was calculated that a minimum of 232 participants was required for this study. All researchers constituted the target population of the study, and participants were recruited until the target number was achieved. Estimating a response rate of 70%, a total of 332 questionnaires were distributed to reach the estimated sample size of 232. Although the questionnaire was developed and validated previously by Mavrinac et al. (), we re-assessed the reliability (internal consistency) of the responses by computing Cronbach's alpha (?) for the overall questionnaire and the three sub-scales of positive attitude, negative attitude, and subjective norms towards plagiarism. For the overall questionnaire, reliability (internal consistency) was excellent in this study (Cronbach's ? = 0.897). Statistical analysis was performed using Stata version 12. For the overall questionnaire, as well as its three sub-scales (described above), the total scale scores were computed. The mean ? standard deviation (?SD) of the overall score, along with the three sub-scales scores, were computed to summarize the total scores. The 5-point Likert scale for each item was then converted to a 3-point Likert scale, 1 ?disagree?, 2 ?neither agree nor disagree?, and 3 ?agree?, to present meaningful frequencies (proportions) of agreement or disagreement for all items.",,,"Bazdaric, K., Bilic-Zulle, L., Brumini, G., Petrovecki, M., Prevalence of plagiarism in recent submissions to the Croatian Medical Journal (2012) Science and Engineering Ethics, 18 (2), pp. 223-239. , https://doi.org/10.1007/s11948-011-9347-2; Bilic-Zulle, L., Frkovic, V., Turk, T., Azman, J., Petrovecki, M., Prevalence of plagiarism among medical students (2005) Croatian Medical Journal, 46 (1), pp. 126-131. , http://www.cmj.hr/2005/46/1/15726686.pdf; Das, N., Panjabi, M., Plagiarism: Why is it such a big issue for medical writers?

A total of 381 Chinese researchers from different universities and disciplines were investigated through an online questionnaire survey in August and September 2018. The results showed that most Chinese researchers are familiar with and have positive attitude to OAJs. They know OAJs mainly through their peers, colleagues, and friends. PubMed Central, PLoS, and COAJ (China Open Access Journals) are the most well-known OAJ websites among Chinese researchers. As for use, most of the respondents read and cite OAJs frequently and have experience of publishing in OAJs. However, they strongly prefer to use OAJs indexed in reputable databases (e.g. Web of Science, WoS) when making publishing decisions. Significant differences can be seen among disciplines, with researchers in HSS areas using OAJs less frequently than researchers from other disciplines, although they have the same positive attitudes and are equally well informed about them. Younger researchers preferred to rely on prestigious institutions and authors when using OAJs.

We consider the attributes, novelty, and disruptive potential of different models, which range from improvements to the extant model to attempts at reconfiguration and transformation. We propose that journal transition can be seen as falling into three categories. The first is enhanced models of the traditional scholarly journal, which typically afford enriched functionality that breaks the bonds of the printed page whilst otherwise remaining wholly traditional in their offerings. The second category is innovative models of the traditional scholarly journal, which aim at supporting the journal in performing its traditional roles through convention-altering ways. The third category is the possible alternatives to the traditional journal, which represent a move towards alternative modes of knowledge dissemination. This review shows that each of the models identified makes contributions to enriching the reporting and showcasing of scholarly output. They also make it more effective and more efficient. However, we conclude that none of the possible alternatives being discussed can serve as a full-fledged alternative to the journal.

Using a combination of small-scale interviews and a larger-scale survey, ECRs were questioned on their searching and reading behaviour, publishing practices, open data, and their use of social media. Questionnaire invitations were sent out via publisher lists, social media networks, university research networks, and specialist ECR membership organizations. One-thousand and six-hundred responses were received, with many coming from China, Russia, and Poland. Results showed that ECRs are adopting millennial-facing tools/platforms, with Google, Google Scholar, social media, and smartphones becoming embedded in their scholarly activities. Open data sharing obtains widespread support but somewhat less practice. There are some differences in attitudes and behaviour according to age and subject specialism.

The study involved the coordination of a focus group discussion and an online survey, to understand and evince the behaviour of researchers regarding data management in that field. Both the discussion group and the survey were performed with researchers from several institutes of the Spanish National Research Council. The lack of a data sharing culture, the fear of being scooped, and confusion between the concepts of the working plan and the data management plan were some of the issues that emerged in the focus group. Respondents' previous experience with sharing their research data has been mainly in the form of appendices to peer-reviewed publications. From the survey (101 responses), the most important motivations for publishing research data were found to be facilitating the reproducibility of the research, increasing the likelihood of citations of the article, and compliance with funding body mandates. Legal constraints, intellectual property, data ownership, data rights, potential commercial exploitation, and misuse of data were the main barriers to publishing data as open data. Citation in publications, certification, compliance with standards, and the reputation of the data providers were the most relevant factors affecting the use of other researchers' data. Being recent or recently updated, well documented, with quality metadata and ease of access were the most valued attributes of open research data. © 2020 The Author(s).

We explored the actual effect upon submission numbers of several possible factors. We retrieved 10 years of submission data from over a thousand journals, as well as data on IF, retractions, and other factors. We performed statistical analysis and identified correlations. We also undertook case study research on the 55 most significant submission decreases. We found a statistically significant correlation between changes in IF, ISI percentage ranking, and changes in submissions numbers in subsequent years. We also found a statistically significant effect on submission numbers in the year following the publication of a retraction. Our case studies identified other factors, including negative feedback on the peer review process. Our findings regarding IF confirm previous indications about the significance of IF on submissions. We explain the correlation with retractions through the concept of ‘peer review reputation’. These results indicate that editors and publishers need to focus on a journal's peer review practices, as well as a journal's IF, if they are to maintain and grow submissions. © 2020 The Author(s).

This paper, based on a random sample of 2,046 retracted papers, which were published between 1975 and 2019, extracted from Retraction Watch and the websites of major publishers, shows that 53% of the retraction notices do not specify who initiated the retraction. Nearly 10% of the retraction notes either omit or do not contain information related to reasons for retractions. Furthermore, most of the retracted papers in our sample have no limitation section; those who do are commonly unhelpful or irrelevant. The results carry three implications for scientific transparency: retraction notices need to be more informative; limitation sections ought to be a required and even an open section of all published articles; and finally, promoting ‘heroic acts’ in science can positively change the current publishing culture. © 2019 The Author(s).

Aspects covered are: discovery and access, authorship practices, peer review, publishing strategies, open access publishing, open data, sharing, collaboration, social media, metrics, impact, reputation, libraries, publishers, and scholarly transformations. Nearly 120 science and social science researchers from seven countries were questioned about these 16 aspects. It was found that some scholarly features work well for ECRs, and in this category can be included: discovery and access, authorship practices, sharing, collaboration, and publishers. Reputation, publishing strategies, and impact are more problematical, and they, in turn, cause tensions regarding some other factors – social media, open access, and open data. Of the rest, libraries are largely invisible, and ECRs have conflicting views concerning ethical behaviour. Few envisage that transformational change will take place in the next 5 years. © 2019 The Author(s).

A questionnaire was developed on the back of a 3-year longitudinal, qualitative study and was distributed through publisher lists, social media networks, university networks, and specialist ECR membership organizations. Identical English, Polish, Russian, Chinese, Spanish, and French versions of the questionnaire were used. Results from 1,600 respondents demonstrated that 82.7% had co-authored a paper, and most had performed a variety of authorship tasks. Almost half the respondents reported being subject to various authorship policies, although a quarter said they were not aware of any such policies. Almost all Chinese ECRs reported being subject to authorship policies, but only a third of UK ECRs reported the same. Three-quarters of ECRs had experience in responding to peer review, and half had been peer reviewers. Half the respondents had a good experience of review and viewed it as a valuable way to improve their authorship skills. However, there was some criticism of some shortcoming such as lengthy peer review and superficial or uninformed comments by reviewers. Double-blind review was the preferred methodology, and there were few suggestions for how to improve the review process. © 2019 The Author(s).

This study classified users who had posted about 749 links on Facebook before October 2017 mentioning 500 medical and health-related research articles, obtained using altmetric.com data. Most accounts (68%) belonged to groups, including online communities, journals, academic organizations, and societies. Of individual profiles, academics accounted for only 4%, but the largest group were health care professionals (16%). More than half (58%) of all Facebook accounts examined were not academic. The non-academic dominance suggests that public Facebook posts linking to health-related articles are mostly used to facilitate scientific knowledge flow between non-academic professionals and the public. Therefore, Facebook mention counts may be a combined academic and non-academic attention indicator in the health and medical domains. © 2019 The Author(s).

This paper analyses a number of trends against this stated purpose, namely, the timing of preprint postings relative to submission to accepting journals; trends in the rate of unpublished preprints over time; trends in the timing of publication of preprints by accepting journals; and trends in the concentration of published, reviewed preprints by publisher. Findings show that a steady c.30% of preprints remain unpublished and that the majority is posted onto bioRxiv close to or after submission – therefore giving no time for feedback to help improve the articles. Four publishers (Elsevier, Nature, PLOS, and Oxford University Press) account for the publication of 47% of bioRxiv preprints. Taken together, it appears that bioRxiv is not accomplishing its stated goals and that authors may be using the platform more to establish priority, as a marketing enhancement of papers, and as functional Green OA, rather than as a community-driven source of prepublication review. © 2019 The Author(s).

We analyse the articles published in PLOS ONE in 2016 and 2017 by classifying them according to the Web of Science Journal Citation Report categories. We have identified 101 substantial categories, 86 of which belong to the Science Citation Index Expanded and 15 to the Social Science Citation Index Expanded. ‘Biochemistry & Molecular Biology’ stands out as the most prolific category, accounting for 9% of the manuscripts. On calculating the impact factor of each topic-based category as if it were an independent journal, we found that 28.7% of them would be placed in the first quartile of their corresponding field. Among the highest-ranked journals, ‘Palaeontology’ and ‘Nursing’ stand out as they would be ranked in the first decile of their respective categories. About 69% of the categories would be in the second and third JCR quartiles, and only two would be in the fourth. This study indicates the need to assess the impact of papers published in megajournals by topic-based category in order to accurately quantify the impact they have on their specific fields. © 2019 The Author(s).

Eighty authors who had published in journals identified as predatory were surveyed. We asked how the authors learnt about these journals, what they thought about the reputation of the journals, their experiences of peer review and the quality of feedback provided, and whether publication was driven by PhD or job requirements. Our results showed that a third of authors discovered the journals by web searches or responding to email invitations. Over half said the reputation and name of the journal were important in selecting a journal, although a third admitted that the journal they published in did not have a good reputation. The main reason for selecting the journals was the promise of fast publication (31.2% respondents). Only half of the respondents said that publication was driven by PhD or job requirements. Just over a third reported that peer review was good or excellent, and only 17.5% said that peer review was poor or non-existent – over 70% thought they had received good feedback from the journals. Although the research was somewhat limited, it does indicate general satisfaction with the journals in which the authors published. Fast publication coupled with good feedback and encouragement to submit can make publishing in predatory journals so tempting that few authors can resist. © 2019 The Author(s).

The present study examined how researchers promote their work with linguistic devices such as positive and negative words and is probably the first one that investigates such promotional devices in not only abstracts but also full texts based on a large dataset of articles (more than 2.2 million). The results showed that the use of positive words in both the abstracts and full texts exhibited a significant uptrend in the past two decades, and positive words were more frequently used than negative ones in both abstracts and full texts. However, journal impact was found to be only very weakly correlated with the use of positive and negative words in both abstracts and full texts. The preference of promotional linguistic devices such as positive words may be explained by factors such as the increasingly competitive selection process of publication, the publication bias, the outcome reporting bias, and the universal positive bias. The study argues for a fair use of such promotional linguistic devices. © 2020 The Authors. Learned Publishing © 2020 ALPSP ?

The main results are as follows. First, the four indices, ordered by total number of papers indexed, across all provinces, are the Science Citation Index (SCI), Chinese Science Citation Database (CSCD), Chinese Social Science Citation Index (CSSCI), and Social Science Citation Index (SSCI). The number of international publications from these regions shows an increasing trend, while the number of domestic research outputs shows a fluctuating trend. Second, the international and domestic publications produced by these regions greatly improved over the study period. Third, different regions vary greatly not only in research output but also in research preference. The top five preferred disciplines of international and domestic academic achievement are very different; the former all belong to the natural sciences, while more than 7 of 10 of the latter belong to the social sciences. Moreover, the adjacency matrices of the similarity of the 31 regions show that there is some correlation between the research spotlight of a region and its economic and cultural patterns. In general, scientific research in China has developed rapidly in recent years, and different regions vary greatly not only in research achievement but also in research preference. © 2020 The Author(s).

The primary dataset (5,176 articles and reviews) was divided into two subsets, the open access (OA) subset (2,964 papers) and non-OA subset (2,212 papers). We also used the primary dataset to create a subset of papers published in Croatian journals (1,588) as opposed to foreign ones. All were screened for full-text OA status, journal JCR quartile ranking, journal dominant discipline, and language of publication. OA papers prevailed with 74.4%. Most were available at publisher websites. The percentage of OA papers in Croatian journals was 99.8%. The share of OA papers was the highest in the humanities and social sciences, which also saw the highest share of papers in the Croatian language. © 2020 The Author(s).

A cross-sectional bibliometric review of COVID-19 literature was undertaken between 1 November 2019 and 24 March 2020, along with a comparative review of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) literature. Investigator responsiveness was assessed by measuring the volume and type of research published. Editorial responsiveness was assessed by measuring the submission-to-acceptance time and availability of original data. Publisher-responsiveness was assessed by measuring the acceptance-to-publication time and the provision of open access. Three hundred and ninety-eight of 2,835 COVID-19 and 55 of 1,513 MERS search results were eligible. Most COVID-19 studies were clinical reports (n = 242; 60.8%). The submission-to-acceptance [median: 5 days (IQR: 3–11) versus 71.5 days (38–106); P <.001] and acceptance-to-publication [median: 5 days (IQR: 2–8) versus 22.5 days (4–48·5-; P <.001] times were strikingly shorter for COVID-19. Almost all COVID-19 (n = 396; 99.5%) and MERS (n = 55; 100%) studies were open-access. Data sharing was infrequent, with original data available for 104 (26.1%) COVID-19 and 10 (18.2%) MERS studies (P =.203). The early academic response was characterized by investigators aiming to define the disease. Studies were made rapidly and openly available. Only one-in-four were published alongside original data, which is a key target for improvement. © 2020 The Author(s).

The data are taken from the most recent investigation in the 4-year-long Harbingers project. A survey was undertaken to establish whether the scholarly communication behaviours of the new wave of researchers are uniform, progressing, or changing in the same overall direction or whether they are impacted significantly by national and cultural differences. A multilingual questionnaire hosted on SurveyMonkey was distributed in 2019 via social media networks of researchers, academic publishers, and key ECR platforms in the UK, USA, France, China, Spain, Russia, Malaysia, and Poland. Over a thousand responses were obtained, and the main findings are that there is a significant degree of diversity in terms of scholarly communication attitudes and practices of ECRs from the various countries represented in the study, which cannot be solely explained by the different make-up of the samples. China, Russia, France, and Malaysia were more likely to be different in respect to a scholarly activity, and responses from the UK and USA were relatively similar. © 2020 The Author(s).

Results find that there are imbalances in diversity inherent in the workforce (96% with a Bachelor's degree or higher, 76% female, 83% heterosexual, 81% White, and 89% report no disabilities) and that outcomes diverge for respondents based on their gender and ethnicity, highlighting distinct inequities in the workplace. The leadership profile is more male (33% vs. 21%), and more White (91% vs. 81%) than the sample as a whole. Moreover, those respondents with characteristics more reflective of the leadership profile are more likely to report that they believe they are fairly compensated, recognized by the leadership, and have fair opportunities for advancement. The article recommends improvements to current practice in recruitment, sponsorship and advocacy, and staff retention to drive change towards creating a more equitable, inclusive workforce. © 2020 The Author(s).

Plan S itself may only have a modest immediate effect on industry-wide sustainability but is the clearest indication of the ‘direction of travel’ for our industry yet. Recent negotiations between publishers and consortia represent a ‘bigger deal’ and may therefore lead to even greater economic power for large commercial publishers. Societies have a greater role than merely allowing researchers to get credit for and disseminate their work. A one-size-fits-all model of open access may threaten the sustainability of other community services managed by learned societies. Do not panic about Plan S! Look to the needs of your community and offer a balanced portfolio of publications and services. © 2020 The Author(s).

A practitioner-focused book portfolio that translates research into practice offers an opportunity to establish an alternative revenue stream and an additional path for society member engagement. Societies are in a unique position to capitalize on their existing connections to industry via their membership base. Brief, easy-to-consume content and interactive tools are of the greatest appeal to the practitioner audience. Focusing on shorter, template-driven formats and more frequent updates allows society publishers to develop content more rapidly and at lower cost. Challenges include incentivizing society members to author and review the content, identifying individuals who are capable of doing so, and obtaining adequate internal resources. © 2020 The Author(s).

We received responses from 3,112 members who either consume, produce, utilize, or support scientific research, from more than 20 countries and across 40 disciplines. This year, we intentionally sought more responses from outside the USA and Western Europe than in the past, making the results more reflective of the diversity of the global research community. This made it clear that the research world is more disparate and, in some cases, such as in the Asia-Pacific region, more contradictory than we have seen. Previously identified observations, such as an increase in respondents' simultaneous membership of multiple societies, have been consolidated, whereas others, such as the demand for support from societies for high standards of publishing ethics, are new to this survey. Central to the survey's findings is the continuing rise in researcher demand for open access and open research as tools for both consumption and production of research. Ultimately, by using these findings, this article suggests some strategies to enable societies to navigate their way through this new and constantly evolving world of academic research. © 2020 The Author(s).

Our journals operate independently and are unique but work together to form a strong portfolio by sharing ideas and best practice. We attribute our success to being embedded in, and led by, the ecological community, which works closely with a professional team of experienced in-house editorial staff. These close interactions between our membership and editorial boards and in-house staff allow us to innovate and adapt to change; we describe three projects that illustrate this. Collaboration with those outside of the BES is an important part of our ethos, and we describe the benefits we have gained through working with others. As part of our strategy, we are keen to embrace a more open and transparent future while continuing to provide publishing opportunities for a global audience. © 2020 The Author(s).

In 2011–2017, the number of peer-reviewed publications from scholars working in Finnish universities and published in Finland was 17,724. Learned societies publish around 70% of these channels and publications, mostly in the fields of humanities and social sciences. Learned societies in Finland focus on journal publishing, whereas university presses and commercial publishers focus on book publishing. In 2016–2017, 38.4% of the learned societies' outputs were OA. This study concludes that Finnish learned societies play an integral part in national scholarly publishing. They play an especially important role in journal publishing, as commercial publishers produce only 2.6% of Finnish journals and book series, and only 1.4% of the journal articles from scholars working in Finnish universities. © 2020 The Author(s).

This project is part of a range of activities that cOAlition S partners are taking forward to support the implementation of Plan S principles. The objective of this project was to explore with learned societies a range of potential strategies and business models through which they could adapt and thrive under Plan S. We consulted with society publishers through interviews, surveys, and workshops about the 27 business models and strategies identified during the project. We also surveyed library consortia about their willingness to support society publishers to make the transition to OA. Our key finding is that transformative agreements emerge as the most promising model because they offer a predictable, steady funding stream. We also facilitated pilot transformative agreement negotiations between several society publishers and library consortia. These pilots and a workshop of consortium representatives and society publishers informed the development of an OA transformative agreement toolkit. Our conclusion is that society publishers should consider all the business models this project has developed and should not automatically equate OA with article publication charges. © 2020 The Author(s).

Our sense throughout the project has been that many participants confused OA publishing with the APC model, which is only one of many options for funding OA, and that they were also concerned about the uneven distributing of funding for APCs. Overall, 41% of our respondents were extremely or very interested in this model, but HSS society publishers were far more anxious, with only 18% of respondents saying that they felt extremely or very interested. Geography magnified this still further. Of our STEM respondents from the USA, 50% were extremely or very interested in this model, but not a single HSS respondent from the USA felt the same way (although this may reflect the small sample size, with only two US‐based HSS society publishers participating). Of our STEM respondents in the rest of the world (ROW), 75% were extremely or very interested, but again, not one HSS respondent from these geographies felt the same (and again, this may reflect the small sample size with only three ROW‐based HSS society publishers participating). Rather interestingly, UK respondents were slightly more sceptical about this approach, with only 37% feeling extremely or very interested; of this group, 50% of the STEM respondents and 19% of the HSS respondents were extremely or very interested. This probably reflects the outcomes from the Finch Review process (Finch, Publishers who were interested in APC payments generally were also interested in institutional prepay schemes, but we detected little enthusiasm from institutions for these schemes. This is probably because the number of articles published with small‐ and medium‐sized publishers is likely to vary a good deal, and so, agreeing on precisely how many articles to pay for in advance is challenging. A very small number of publishers expressed real interest in submission fees, with one respondent just poised to launch them for one of its journals. The anxieties expressed by other respondents were around the uneven availability of funding coupled with very serious concerns that it was unfair, or at least impractical, to expect authors to pay when they had a high chance of having their article rejected.",").

It reviews funding and sales, scholarly collaboration networks, developments in OA, and monograph publishing. These key areas were identified in an earlier article that asked whether academic publishing was evolving or going through a revolution. The review of funding and sales presented here shows a mixed market with growth being challenged as library funds and purchase choices affect expenditure. Scholarly collaboration networks were previously identified as a major threat to traditional publishing, and a review of this area demonstrates that greater sharing of content is empowering librarians and academics to take a stronger stand in publisher negotiations. OA continues to be debated, and a review of responses to Plan S (the most coordinated policy to date) demonstrates conflicting views within academia, funders, and publishers. OA has yet to revolutionize the existing business models. Similarly, monograph publishing remains slow to evolve, although there are increasing initiatives to adopt more open, and online, models. The conclusion of this review is that libraries are likely to be the key promoters of change in the publishing environment and are more influential than other players in forcing evolution. © 2019 The Author(s).Learned Publishing © 2019 ALPSP.",,,,,,,,,,,"Adema, J., (2019), http://repository.jisc.ac.uk/7413/3/Towards_a_Roadmap_for_Open_Access_Monographs_June_2019.pdf, .

While growing numbers of publishers are writing editorials and formulating guidelines on TR, little is known about how editors view the practice or how they respond to it. We present results from an interview-based study of 21 North American journal editors from a broad range of academic disciplines. Our findings show that editors' beliefs and practices are quite individualized rather than being tied to disciplinary or other structural parameters. While none of our participants supported the use of large amounts of recycled material from one journal article to another, some editors were staunchly against any use of recycled material, while others were accepting of the practice in certain circumstances. Issues of originality, the challenges of rewriting text, the varied circulation of texts, and abiding by copyright law were prominent themes as editors discussed their approaches to TR. Overall, the interviews showed that many editors have not thought systematically about the practice of TR, and they sometimes have trouble aligning their beliefs and practices. © 2019 The Author(s).Learned Publishing © 2019 ALPSP.",,,,,,,"National Science Foundation, NSF: NSF15528","This paper is the product of the Text Recycling Research Project ( textrecycling.org ), a multi‐institution research initiative working to advance our understanding of TR.

There is no regulated checking of author affiliations as authors are expected to only include affiliations to universities that have contributed substantially to the research conducted and to the published manuscript. Our study aims to establish whether author affiliations can be validated and if there is evidence of misrepresentation from authors who report multiple institutional affiliations. We conducted an exploratory case study on Scopus-indexed articles for 2016, searching all authors who reported multiple institutional affiliations in which at least one of them was to a Chilean university. Of 4,961 author records with multiple affiliations, we were unable to validate 38% of the affiliations to a Chilean university by checking the institutional websites. This affected 40% of articles and was most prevalent in health sciences and for private, new, universities. ORCID identifiers were not suitable for checking affiliations as there was low use of them: only 14% of the multiple-affiliated authors. The inability to validate affiliations might indicate misconduct, and if it is an indication of misrepresentation, it could have profound implications for many stakeholders (universities, journals, ranking houses, funders, and higher education policy-makers) due to inflated publication counts and under-reporting the actual input from individual institutions. © 2019 The Author(s).

Three questionnaires were created and distributed via WeChat: an author questionnaire for healthcare professionals, an editor questionnaire for medical journal editors, and a questionnaire for ghostwriters. A total of 1,073 healthcare professionals, 78 medical editors, and 23 ghostwriters responded; 33 (3.075%, 95% confidence interval: 2.041–4.110%) authors reported hiring ghostwriters, most of whom were clinicians (5.06%) or nurses (7.86%) and were in the 31–50 years old group. There was a negative correlation with the level of education. Editors reported few papers identified as ghostwritten, and most of them would immediately reject such articles. The majority of ghostwriters reported working part time as a ghostwriter for less than 1 year and earning little money from the work. The majority of respondents recognized ghostwriting as unethical, but only on the edge of law and ethics, and with few repercussions for the authors. © 2019 The Author(s).

Within the fields of SSH alone, the publication output grew by 17% a year in the 2008–2018 period, encouraged by government policies and financial incentives for researchers. This review demonstrates an environment where there is sufficient financial growth to support increased R&D but limited skills and knowledge of how to increase quality publication output, either within national or international journals. The article highlights the drivers of increasing scientific publication output, as well as the traps and pitfalls that follow this competition. It suggests that there are opportunities for publishers and other organizations to improve ethical and practical publishing issues and to develop co-publishing agreements that will increase the visibility of the country in international academia. The article indicates the harsh reality of pursuing higher publishing standards in academia, a world that has long been dominated by authors and publishers from industrialized countries. © 2019 The Author(s).

To investigate the reasons for final rejection and whether these articles were finally published, we evaluated submissions to Obstetrics & Gynecology from January 2013 to December 2017. We found that, of 8,119 manuscripts submitted, 1,650 (20.3%) were invited for revision, of which 121 or 7.3% were ultimately rejected or withdrawn from publication after an invitation for revision. In multivariable analyses, manuscripts rejected after an invitation for revision were more likely to be original research and to have higher-than-average reviewer quality scores compared to those accepted after revision. Primary reasons for revision included data interpretation and analytical methods. Reasons for rejection after revision were generally modifiable, but over a third would have required a change to the original study design. Most rejected manuscripts following revision were published in another MEDLINE-indexed obstetrics and gynaecology journal but usually with a lower impact factor than Obstetrics & Gynecology. © 2019 The Author(s).

Earned media – i.e. when influencers write about your work – is key to reaching larger and more diverse audiences. There is plenty of data for tracking engagement and use of articles, but it is scattered across multiple tools and providers and can be misleading or even incorrect.

Enforcing general requirements can improve the quality of published studies without promoting a narrowly defined scientific method that would limit the scope of science. The reproducibility movement advises against using novelty as the main requirement for publication and promotes the enforcement of transparent reporting and rigorous peer review. Novelty is important for science but must not be the sole requirement for publication decisions as this can lead to publication bias and seriously distort the scientific literature. While the scientific community remains responsible for thoroughly evaluating published papers, strengthening the peer review process will help to improve transparency and replicability. © 2019 The Author(s).

The main objective of this study is to determine how Egyptian and Saudi Arabian social sciences and humanities scholars engage in scholarly communication practices. The study used a mixed-methods approach. A questionnaire was answered by a sample of 104 participants, followed by interviews with 36 participants to gain insight into the scholarly communication behaviour of the Arab scholars. The analysis demonstrated that participants use different styles of scholarly communication approaches. Most of the participants do use informal (social media) channels to communicate their research findings (particularly ResearchGate and Facebook), although priority is given to formal over informal publication in peer reviewed journals. Responses showed that the promotional systems of both countries dictate publication choices of scholars, reducing the amount of collaboration by ranking co-publications lower than sole publications and favouring printed journals over online-only journals. © 2019 The Author(s).

Understanding the time and relationship issues that ECRs face can help publishers develop better systems and services. Talking to ECRs demonstrates a frustration that the editing, peer reviewing, and publishing ecosystem is built by people with whom they do not identify and by whom they are not represented. There is a greater role for journal editors to offer support, advice, and encouragement to ECRs. ECRs want journals to take more of a lead in promoting open science and supporting novel research outputs. There is a need for publishers to develop tools and systems that simplify journal requirements and help ECRs to publish. © 2019 The Author(s). Learned Publishing published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of ALPSP.",,,,,,,,"Similar to established researchers, ECRs measure their research output and success by their publication activity. They are assessed by it, too. They must demonstrate that their work is ongoing, and they are becoming increasingly aware of preprint servers to do this without delay. In some disciplines, they meet their reporting deadlines by posting their work to preprint servers prior to submitting to journals. ECRs express concerns that funder needs shape research ideas. They recognize that securing research funds requires effort and paperwork and that the timing of this is important. They are positive about the opportunities created for them by research funding ? particularly funding designed expressly for ECRs. They understand the need for funding to support dissemination of research to the public.",,,"Cassidy, G., (2018), https://hub.wiley.com/community/exchanges/discover/blog/2018/03/21/how-should-journals-adapt-to-the-needs-of-the-next-generation-of-researchers, .

The report began as a study of Amazon's impact as an academic library vendor, but expanded into a broader study of the purchasing of individual print and e-book titles within a specific price range across all vendors. The project uses data provided by academic libraries that use Ex Libris' ALMA integrated library system and OCLC's Worldshare Management Services (WMS); these systems do not allow users to create customized fields of data and so, theoretically, would provide more compatible data. The report's strength is in defining high-level acquisition patterns across academic libraries, vendors, and broad disciplinary fields; the analysis and findings are not granular. The authors believe their report provides one of the broadest overviews of acquisitions patterns of US academic libraries than has ever been conducted to date; there is no reason to doubt them. LAP demonstrates a methodology for study acquisitions and points to numerous other avenues of potential research. © 2019 The Author(s).

Over a hundred science and social science ECRs from seven countries, spanning three continents, were depth-interviewed annually for 3 years (2016–2018) about their attitudes and behaviours with respect to 23 scholarly issues and activities (aspects). In order to provide an accessible overarching assessment of an extremely large and complex dataset, the interview data were categorized according to the strength and direction of change exhibited and the trends and points of interest raised. Results show that all ECRs have changed in one way or another, and a small minority has changed greatly in both attitude and practice and that collaboration and research impact are the scholarly aspects where most changes have occurred, and the greatest cause of change is not so much new technology as a change of jobs. © 2019 The Author(s).

One widespread, but hardly tested, assumption is the idea that articles published in predatory journals deviate substantially from those published in traditional journals. In this paper, we address this assumption by utilizing corpus linguistic tools. We compare the ‘academic-like’ nature of articles from two different journals in political science, one top-ranking and one alleged predatory. Our findings indicate that there is significant linguistic variation between the two corpora along the dimensions that we test. The articles display notable differences in the types and usage of keywords in the two journals. We conclude that articles published in so-called predatory journals do not conform to linguistic norms used in higher-quality journals. These findings may demonstrate a lack of quality control in predatory journals but may also indicate a lack of awareness and use of such linguistic norms by their authors. We also suggest that there is a need for the education of authors in science writing as this may enable them to publish in higher-ranked and quality-assured outlets. © 2019 The Author(s).

Responsive to the realities of modern academia, a TBP provides doctoral candidates with opportunities to engage in the scholarly publication process, and to build their research portfolio. As the TBP gains further traction in many fields and countries, there is a need to better understand the skills and attributes needed to complete a TBP successfully. This paper draws on the views of 246 recent doctoral graduates of Australian universities to identify the skills and attributes they felt supported their success. Their responses have implications for the development and refinement of institutional policies and programs that are sensitive to the needs and experiences of doctoral candidates seeking to publish during candidature and create a TBP. As editors, peer-reviewers, and publishers see a growing influx of papers sole- or co-authored by doctoral candidates in response to the trend toward TBP, they may find themselves involved in supporting students to develop the skills and attributes needed to successfully publish during candidature. © 2019 The Author(s).

This led to analysis and discussion on the skewness of citations in the journal Sustainability and within Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI) journals, particularly investigating self-citations at journal and publisher levels. I analysed articles published by Sustainability in 2015 and found that self-citations are higher than expected under a uniform probability distribution. Self-citations in this journal make a 36% difference to the journal's impact factor. This research raises the question of what citation patterns can be expected as normal, and where the boundary between normal and anomaly lies. I suggest the issue deserves further investigation because self-citations have several implications, ranging from impact factors to visibility and influence of scientific journals. © 2019 The Author(s).

DOAJ's coverage of OA journals from different regions of the world is, however, far from complete, particularly of journals publishing in languages other than English. Using alternative data sources for identification and manual verification, 437 scholarly OA journals published in the five Nordic countries (Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, and Sweden) were identified, and some key characteristics were studied. Of these, only 184 were indexed in DOAJ. A vast majority of the journals was published by scholarly societies or universities. Social sciences and humanities dominated as topics, and few journals charge authors. National or university-specific OJS portals have played a major role in enabling OA publishing. Around a third of the Nordic scholarly journals are currently OA. © 2019 The Author(s).

The warnings about such journals are plentiful, but the methods used to identify them vary a great deal and make it difficult to accurately determine which journals are fraudulent or simply of low quality. This article presents an overview of the existing frameworks for identifying questionable journals and discussions around them. Most of the frameworks rely on describing the journals under investigation according to a set of criteria, and some can even be turned into a metric or mechanism. The development of frameworks for identifying questionable journals has so far been characterized by a great diversity in format, length, and content.

It addressed the following research questions: (1) What patterns of citations exist among authors of research articles using HINTS data? and (2) How is the citation format of HINTS data characterized? We collected scholarly articles that used HINTS data as primary or secondary data for analysis from Web of Science databases and HINTS publications on the NCI website. Among the resulting 250 articles, we identified citations to HINTS data themselves (data citations) and those to HINTS-related documents (data-related citations). Among the 250 articles, 156 articles (62.4%) cited HINTS data or HINTS-related documents; only 29 articles (11.6%) cited HINTS data, while 127 (50.8%) cited HINTS-related documents. Both data and data-related citations increased over time. Data citation format varied, and 13 different compositions of citation elements were identified. Author, Title, and Location (URL) were common elements. The frequent use of URLs is undesirable due to URL instability. Furthermore, the data citations showed not only various compositions of citation elements but also ill-defined element formats.

However, many of these journals have acceptable scholarly quality. The present study compares such removed journals to a trustworthy bibliometric database, SCImago Journal & Country Rank (the Scopus Database). It finds many overlaps. Some of the overlapping journals have a high score in the SCImago ranks. This paper calls for a more transparent process of journal reviews by DOAJ or even a re-examination of the selection criteria and/or the evaluation process. © 2018 The Author(s).

In this article, we describe the role of peer review and how our five principles support that goal.

This study investigated two disciplines: Library, Information & Documentation Science and Metallurgical Engineering & Technology. We collected data from GS and the Chongqing VIP database to evaluate GS as a citation database for Chinese journals on its resource coverage, journal ranking, and citation data. We found that GS covered 100% of the sample journals but indexed 22% more article records than the number of articles published. The ranking of Chinese journals by GS Metrics was not suitable to present a dependable ranking of Chinese journals. GS appeared suitable to provide an alternative source of Chinese citation data, even though there existed coverage problems, including article duplication and citation omission and potential duplication. The GS Metric average citation provided results highly correlated to traditional citation results, showing that it would be suitable for evaluating Chinese journals. © 2018 The Author(s).

One of the aims of the project was to discover if ECRs were adopting disrupting platforms that, legitimately or illegitimately, promote openness and sharing. It has been alleged that such an adoption appeals to them as Millennials. More than 100 ECRs from seven countries were questioned annually, and questions about Sc-Hub were raised as part of discussions about discovery and access. Interview data were supplemented by desk research and Google Trends statistics. It was found that Sci-Hub use was increasing and that a quarter of the ECRs now use it, with French ECRs being the biggest users. However, Sci-Hub is making little headway with ECRs from the UK, USA, Malaysia, and China, although in China's case, this can be explained by it being banned and the country having its own equivalent, www.91lib.com. Sci-Hub is used as much for convenience as necessity; use is not connected to the strength of library provision and and it has been suggested that it represents a bigger threat to publishers than ResearchGate, whose star might be waning. © 2018 The Author(s).

To quickly increase the international influence of Chinese journals, government management launched significant initiatives for publishers, such as the ‘Project for Enhancing International Impact of China STM Journals (PIIJ, 2013–2018)’. This paper investigates the underlying objectives and assumptions made about the value and impact of Chinese E-L journals and the effect of PIIJ support and international publisher collaboration. The authors conclude that, while the E-L journals are demonstrating some quantifiable improvements in internationalization, there are no equal pressures or recognition for qualitative quality measures, and this may undermine the ability of Chinese E-L journals to build sustainable strategic plans. © 2018 The Author(s).

It focused on quite experienced authors in the educational sector of all eight universities in Finland. Data were gathered using an electronic questionnaire, which was completed by 121 respondents. The majority of authors perceived reviewer feedback as developmental and appreciated critical but constructive review. Over 60% of respondents found reviewers usually keen to improve the article and to provide pertinent critique. Less than 8% reported frequent experience of reviewers who were not experts or provided unjustified accusations. A third reported reviewer feedback that was frequently biased or based on different paradigms. The most published authors were the most satisfied with the developmental feedback, but postdoctoral researchers had received more developmental complementary feedback than any other groups. The results indicate that the peer review system remains useful for ensuring article quality, but some attention is still required to ensure developmental feedback that will help the authors enhance their manuscripts. © 2018 The Author(s).

The article also presents three case studies of CELJs to demonstrate different strategies for achieving internationalization. We find that there has been rapid growth in CELJs between 2006 and 2011 but mostly in the science, technology and medicine disciplines. There are now 435 CELJs, of which 62.3% are published in association with a western publisher. Partnership has been shown to provide immediate benefits to an established successful journal (Cell Research), has helped to relaunch an established title in English (Bamboo and Silk), and has enabled the successful launch of a new journal (Global Health Research and Policy). The authors conclude that there are three criteria for successful international CELJs: increased visibility, good editorial boards, and international publishing partnerships. © 2018 The Author(s).

We conclude that there is a wide variety of practices and no common understanding of what the different authorship positions signify. Authorship guidelines do not provide much help. We recognize that, regardless of what system for valuing authorship positions is used, it will be misleading and unfair in most applications because relative contributions vary in ways that are not captured by fixed value assignments to authorship positions. In theory, assigning percentage figures reflecting the relative contributions of the authors would solve that problem, but we argue that such a scheme is not likely to work in practice. It can also be questioned whether relative, rather than absolute, contributions should be the basis for scientific merit. Contributorship is discussed as an alternative, but is recognized to be insufficient both in communicating absolute and relative contributions, as standardly used. However, there may be a way forward with contributorship, but then, the level of detail needs to increase considerably and its application be standardized. © 2018 The Author(s).

These assumptions are: (1) fully OA journals are inherently of poorer quality than journals supported by other business models and (2) the OA business model, that is, paying for publication, is more ‘competitive’ than the subscription journal access business model. The assumptions have been discussed in contemporary industry venues, and we have encountered them in the course of their work advising scholarly communications organizations. Our objective was to apply data analytics techniques to see if these assumptions bore scrutiny. By combining citation-based impact scores with data from publishers’ price lists, we were able to look for relationships between business model, price, and ‘quality’ across several thousands of journals. We found no evidence suggesting that OA journals suffer significant quality issues compared with non-OA journals. Furthermore, authors do not appear to ‘shop around’ based on OA price. © 2019 The Author(s).

In this paper, I review the last 12 months: librarians showing muscle in negotiations, publishers’ Read and Publish deals, and funders determined to force change with initiatives like Plan S. I conclude that these efforts will not work. For example, flipping to supply-side business models, such as article processing charges, simply flips the pay-wall to a ‘play-wall’ to the disadvantage of authors without financial support. I argue that the focus on OA makes us miss the bigger problem: today’s scholarly communications is unaffordable with today’s budgets. OA is not the problem, the publishing process is the problem. To solve it, I propose using the principles of digital transformation to reinvent publishing as a two-step process where articles are published first as preprints, and then, journal editors invite authors to submit only papers that ‘succeed’ to peer review. This would reduce costs significantly, opening a sustainable pathway for scholarly publishing and OA. The catalyst for this change is for the reputation economy to accept preprints as it does articles in minor journals today. © 2019 The Author(s).

The question of why researchers decide to publish in a questionable journal remains relatively unexplored. This paper provides an overview of the existing literature on why researchers decide to publish papers in questionable journals, specifically whether or not they search for a low-barrier way to getting published while being aware that the chosen journal probably does not adhere to acceptable academic standards. The choice of a publication outlet can be seen as a submission tree that consists of various incentives, and explaining why authors publish in deceptive journals may thus consist of a combination of awareness and motivational factors. Awareness and motivation of diligent authors is very different from that of unethical authors. Unethical authors may use a lack of awareness to excuse their actions, but they may actively search for a low-barrier way to getting published. As there are different types of authors who publish in deceptive journals, we need different approaches to solve the problem. © 2019 The Author(s).

In particular, it raises concerns about the strong influence the movement is having on which papers are published. The primary effect is through changes to the peer review process. These not only require that the data and software used to generate the reported results be part of the review but also that the novelty criterion should be deprecated. This paper questions a central tenet of the movement, the idea of a single, well-defined, and iterative scientific method. Philosophers, historians of science, and scientists alike have argued extensively against the idea of a single method. Some going as far as to suggest that there are as many methods as scientists. I am convinced that there are broad, high-level ideas that bind scientists together. Yet, anything more sharply delineated that could reasonably be entitled a scientific method is not logically or historically justified. If this criticism is accepted, then changes to the peer review process are not warranted. Furthermore, I would contend that the influence the reproducible research movement is having on the publishing of papers, and elsewhere, should be considerably curtailed. © 2019 Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Canada.

Fears over large-scale plagiarism, particularly in articles submitted by authors for whom English is a second language, have only been investigated in small publishing communities or using duplication-checking analysis, which does not separate legitimate from unacceptable duplication. This research surveyed journal editors from around the world to ascertain recent (past year) experiences of plagiarized and/or duplicated submissions. We then compared their experiences to their assumptions about global levels of plagiarism. The survey received 372 responses, including 119 from Asian editors, 112 from European editors, and 57 from editors in North America. The respondents estimated that c.15% of all submissions contained plagiarized or duplicated content, although their own experiences were in the range of 2–5% of submissions. Of the respondents, 42% reported no incidence of plagiarized or duplicated submissions in the past year. Asian editors experienced the highest levels of plagiarized/duplicated content, although most of the problem articles were resolved, indicating that most of the identified duplication constituted relatively minor problems, rather than fraudulent plagiarism. © 2019 The Author(s).

Can we afford open access (OA)? How do we pay for high-quality services? Why does it cost so much? In this article, we argue that the sterility of much of this debate is a result of failure to tackle the question of what a journal is in economic terms. We offer a way through by demonstrating that a journal is a club and discuss the implications for the scholarly publishing industry. We use examples, ranging from OA to prestige journals, to explain why congestion is a problem for club-based publications, and to discuss the importance of creative destruction for the maintenance of knowledge-generating communities in publishing. © 2019 The Author(s).

We analysed four journals using blended systems of editor-selected reviewers (ESR) and Journal Administrator-selected reviewers (JASR) from four disciplines: medicine, sociology, education, and business/applied psychology. In blended journals, both editors and Journal Administrators select authors to review using web-based expert-finding tools. All reviewers selected were both authors and reviewers. We primarily wanted to assess the quality of reviews from both ESR and JASR reviewer selection methodologies. Reviewer rigour was defined as differences between editor decisions and reviewer recommendations. Timeliness data were also recorded and analysed separately as an indicator of efficiency. Reviewer rigour, the quality of reviewers’ evaluations, was estimated from the level of agreement between editors and reviewers. Timeliness was not considered a direct measure of rigour. For two journals, no statistically significant differences were observed; for two, in a small proportion of cases, ESR reviews were more negative. One journal showed some statistically significant major differences but only in 2% of reviews. Timeliness data indicated some statistically significant trends that JASR return reviews more promptly. Therefore, where editors rely on at least two reviewers’ recommendations, JASR is equally rigorous as ESR. © 2019 The Author(s).

Focusing mainly on the role of English and language editing in revision, the present study investigated this process in terms of the Iranian scholars’ perceptions, problems, and strategies. To this end, 15 Iranian scholars from different disciplines were selected and interviewed, and different themes were derived and analysed. According to the premise of Academic Literacies and the idea that we acquire the skills and practices of our professions mainly by participating in them, our results introduced revision as a set of social practices located within a specific academic structure reflecting particular beliefs and values. Our results also showed that the very specific situation in Iran caused the participants to be, at a great extent, overwhelmed by the process, often leading them to adopt strategies that might not be conducive to their academic advancement. © 2018 The Author(s).

The few existing studies have found these metrics misleading. Our study examined the criteria used by these impact factors to see whether they are fake metrics or represent early efforts for developing new standards to advance journal evaluations. We analysed as many available alternative impact factors as possible and discovered that their methodologies were either unreproducible or based on unreliable or opaque criteria. We hope this study will help shed light on the ecosystem of OA publishing and identify both possibly unprofessional behaviours and potential improvements in bibliometric algorithms. © 2018 The Author(s).

We evaluated claims of efficacy, reporting of adverse events, access to (and quality of) supporting references, conflict of interest, and drug price in print advertisements for prescription drugs in three leading US medical journals (The New England Journal of Medicine, Journal of the American Medical Association, and Annals of Internal Medicine) from May 2016 to October 2016. Forty-two unique advertisements for 39 distinct drugs were identified among 190 total advertisements. The wholesaler acquisition cost of 19 (49%) drugs was >$1,000 for 1 month of treatment, and 5 (13%) cost ≥$120,000 per year. Supporting references from peer reviewed medical literature were cited in only 52% of advertisements, and 48% listed only prescribing information, a package insert, and/or data on file. Requests for data on file were unsuccessful in 9 of 13 cases. Of the studies referenced, 89% were co-authored by individuals who had financial ties to the drug manufacturer, and 69% were also sponsored by the company. We conclude that prescription drug advertisements do not provide sufficient information for physicians to critically review claims made and do not meet the ethical and quality standards that the journals apply to articles they publish. New journal advertisement guidelines are needed. © 2018 The Author(s).

However, this journey can pose several significant challenges for ECRs. We use an autoethnographic approach that draws deeply on our lived experience as ECRs to capture our recent and current experiences of negotiating the academic journal article publication journey to explore the tensions, contradictions, and benefits encountered in the journey. We critically examine challenges we experienced in choosing a target journal and negotiating the follow-up process; undertaking revisions; and our experiences of limitations and possibilities in peer review and editorial support. While the peer review journal writing process has played a significant role in supporting us to become more effective ECRs, we also highlight challenges we faced negotiating ethical quandaries in this space, as well as illustrate how our preconceptions of a simple publication journey were confounded by subsequent experience of the complex realities of the space. We also suggest that educational interventions are indicated to provide ECRs support in foundational knowledge about what constitutes valuable revisions, an effective paper, and the scope of issues that can be addressed to make a paper more effective, with reference to the possibility of academic mentoring to support this need. Finally, we explore our findings in light of the tensions imposed by the relative inexperience and lack of power yielded by ECRs. © 2018 The Author(s).

Fifty articles from each journal published between 2014 and 2018 were examined using expert manual inspection, Adobe Acrobat Pro XI, PDF Accessibility Checker 3 and NVDA screen reader. Results show that only 15.5% of the documents were tagged, only 10.5% had alternative text for images, 74.5% had bookmarks to facilitate navigation, and 87% had meaningful titles in their title fields. However, image alternative texts were meaningless, and title fields were not displayed when the document was open. However, all the documents had accessibility permissions enabled; hence, they could be read with Adobe Acrobat Pro XI Read Out Loud feature and NVDA screen reader. All the articles had an alternative HTML version of their full text in the same location on their website as the PDF versions. The inconsistency with which each PDF was produced suggests the need for an improvement in the workflow process to improve accessibility. © 2018 The Author(s).

The greatest issue around data sharing is organizing the data in a useful way. The amount of data sharing varies widely within the sciences, with biology researchers sharing the most and physical sciences sharing the least. Asian researchers share their data the most while Australasians share the least. The white paper underestimates the importance of attitudes when assessing the obstacles.

An additional goal was identifying practical steps that monograph publishers can take to ensure that they make the most of the data they have access to. The project team carried out an analysis of downloaded figures from platforms providing access to UCL Press monograph titles, social media activity, and sales patterns. Patterns of engagement with the books were cross-referenced against key marketing and dissemination events in order to identify relationships between marketing approaches and awareness or use of a title. This study shows that it is possible to gain valuable insights into the uses of OA books by collating and analysing usage and social media data. It also identifies a series of relatively straightforward steps that can be taken by presses to maximize the richness of the data captured. These include proactively gathering and storing data; providing best practice advice to those engaging in promotion, particularly when promotion is via social media; and making it easier to track specific efforts to publicize books by using tagged links. © 2018 The Author(s). Learned Publishing © 2018 ALPSP.",,,,,,,,"The ability to fully exploit the new kinds of data that are becoming available for books has generally been restricted to large publishers or content aggregators with the resources to invest in its collection, management, and analysis. However, as the case study reported in this paper demonstrates, the growing availability of data relating to use and engagement from a range of sources has the potential to support strategic decision-making by small OA monograph publishers. Smaller publishers generally have access to rich data about the books that they publish, and free and low-cost tools are helping to lower the barriers to its collection and analysis. We report on a collaborative research project that set out to engage with data that are readily available to a small OA monograph press and to explore the extent to which low-cost tools for data capture and analysis could provide useful insight into strategic decision-making.

Research questions were: What place does OA have in attitudes of French researchers in mathematics, biology, and computer science? Are French researchers aware of new publishing models? Do they publish in these new outlets? What funds do they use? What kind of feedback and satisfaction can we observe? We used a quantitative approach to identify structural trends. From April to May 2015, the authors gathered empirical data (interviews, training, and meetings) on researchers’ opinions and understanding of OA publishing models to define the variables and build up the questionnaire that was sent out in June 2015. The findings of the survey demonstrated that, when choosing journals to publish their articles, researchers did not rate OA as a criterion but rather impact, prestige, and symbolic recognition. Publishing OA articles is only in its first stages in the publishing practices of researchers. Lack of policy, prescriptions, and lack of rewards explain why OA is not a factor that determines the publishing strategies of French researchers. The researchers who take the risk of OA publishing are biologists, the older and more experienced researchers, and those who are members of editorial teams. © 2018 The Author(s).

While digital initiatives and new university presses are being positively encouraged in the UK as part of the push to deliver policy-driven open access (OA), it is the USA, despite no central OA monograph policy on the horizon, that is leading the way in funding, promoting, and delivering relevant book-length OA initiatives via substantial philanthropic funding from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation and initiatives such as TOME (Towards an Open Monograph Environment). These initiatives not only fund such projects directly but also, in the case of TOME, match university and research library funding with the skills and infrastructure of existing university presses. Most significantly, they put university presses at the heart of the solution and provide them with the support and funding they need to develop new workflows and infrastructures that can help to sustain the monograph in years to come. In his article, Charles Watkinson, Director of Michigan University Press and the recipient of several Mellon awards, plots these initiatives and assesses their contribution to the scholarly publishing landscape. Even since the writing of this article, another Mellon Foundation grant has been announced: the University of North Carolina Press has been awarded $950,000 to undertake a project to research ways in which production workflows for monographs could be streamlined for direct-to-OA publishing in order to reduce overall costs and help to make certain monographs more viable.","In a too often Anglocentric, Global North dominated discussion of scholarly publishing, other national contexts are frequently overlooked. Pierre Mounier of the French organization OPERAS (open access in the European research area through scholarly communication), describes in his article the ‘bibliodiver-sity’ that exists in Europe, with many small OA publishers and university presses publishing works in their national language, on their own platforms, and often serving authors at their own insti- tutions. OPERAS, a coalition of over 30 publishers that has received Horizon 2020 funding from the European Commission, is working to develop shared infrastructure and services and adopt common standards to boost the discoverability of this enormous OA resource. Meanwhile, Thierry M. Luescher of the University of the Free State and Human Sciences Research Council, and François van Schalkwyk of the Centre for Research on Evaluation, Science and Technology (CREST) at Stellenbosch University, have remedied a major gap in the literature on university presses with their fascinating recent work on the university press in Africa, an extension of which is included in this issue.",,"Horowitz, A., (2012), https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2012/feb/27/anthony-horowitz-do-we-still-need-publishers, 27 February).

Four case studies from Ethiopia, Kenya, and South Africa show how different presses adapt their practices and adopt new technologies. Interpreted through an institutional logics perspective, the status of the university presses is described according to established editorial and market logics, to which a third, hypothetical logic of the knowledge commons is added. The logic of the knowledge commons accounts for changes advanced by the digitization of content, peer-to-peer networks as the basis for production, the rise of open access, and an emerging social capitalism. In two cases, we find university presses constrained by traditional editorial logics, while a third one exhibits a hybrid editorial–market model with the purposive adoption of new technologies. Only the fourth, recently established press has embraced the new logic of the knowledge commons wholeheartedly. Thus, if there is a second transition of the academic publishing industry underway, it is in its early stages, partial, and limited in the African context. We thus show that the logic of the knowledge commons provides a useful theoretical lens for studying the far-reaching and rapid ongoing changes in international academic publishing in Africa and further afield. © 2018 The Author(s).

In the face of a changing context, the structures supporting the publication of academic books have been stable.

Separating functions could also be applied to long-form scholarly works, with potential benefits that are worth exploring. © 2018 The Author(s).

In part driven itself by technology, there is an increasing pressure to democratize access to knowledge, manifest in the research context, with the drive towards open access. Academic researchers face a stark choice between being easily accessible to all or increasingly irrelevant. In turn, research policymakers are increasingly focussing on developing conditions that facilitate, incentivise, or even require open access to scholarly outputs. And again, while the initial focus has been on journal articles, long-form scholarly outputs are receiving increasing attention (see, e.g. the recent announcement from the Swiss National Science Foundation: www.snf.ch/en/theSNSF/research-policies/open-access/Pages/default.aspx#OA%202020% 20Policy).

An instance of the first is the interactive digital monograph Enchanting the Desert, which was developed and published by Stanford University Press as part of a project to explore the publication of interactive works, funded by the Andrew W.

The second often takes the form of an enhanced PDF or html edition, as in the case of UCL Press’s Four Histories about Early Dutch Football, which also has a downloadable appendix, making available the data that supports the research (Piercey, 2016). These may not be models that can be adopted by many, or even the majority of publishers, but requests for greater flexibility are likely to increase as, for example, open research data becomes an issue for universities. There is a huge variety of method and practice across the arts, humanities, and social sciences, and this diversity is not always reflected in the means of publication available.

This article looks at the work of Open Access in the European Research Area through Scholarly Communication (OPERAS), a consortium of 36 partners from all over Europe, including many university presses, that is working to build a future European infrastructure to address the challenges in open access publishing. Their initial study, OPERAS-D, revealed a variety of models among the partners influenced by national cultures. Although the partners’ activities were found to be fragmented, they also reflect the ‘bibliodiversity’ that exists in European societies. To address the challenge of fragmentation, it is argued that, by following a cooperative model, European actors can benefit by sharing expertise, resources, and costs of development for the good of all. As a future infrastructure to support open scholarly communication across Europe, OPERAS aims to coordinate a range of publishers and service providers to offer researchers and societies a fully functional web of services to cover the entire research lifecycle. © 2018 The Author(s).

The paper also investigated the number of Arab scholars who are publishing in predatory journals and the reasons that drive them to select these journals to share their scholarly findings. The study adopted a mixed methods approach. Eighteen journals that were categorized as predatory journals were scanned to find the number of Arab scholars who published in them. Then, a questionnaire was sent to Egyptian and Saudi scholars as they were found to be the top Arab contributors in these journals. The questionnaire was followed by semi-structured interviews to gain an in-depth understanding of the publishing behaviour. The data showed that many Arab scholars prefer publishing in predatory journals as these journals are easier and faster. The results also indicate that there is a need to raise the awareness of the harm that predatory journals can cause to the scholars and how they can avoid these journals. This study was conducted with social science and humanities scholars in Egypt and Saudi Arabia. The publishing behaviour may differ in other scholarly disciplines and other Arabic countries. © 2018 The Author(s).

The results indicated that (1) Ra responded more positively than Re, that is, accepted invitations to review more often, more likely to suggest alternative reviewers, and less likely to neglect a review invitation; (2) there was no statistically significant difference in timeliness between Ra and Re; (3) editors rated Re reviews of higher quality than Ra reviews, but the word count length of these reviews did not differ statistically; (4) Ra made more favourable publication recommendations than Re; and (5) Ra were more often based in the country of the authors than Re, and this correlated with the location effect on reviewer response and publication recommendations. These results suggest that authors should be encouraged to suggest reviewers. However, in terms of policy or procedure based on the results of this study, journals/editors should collect and consult at least one review from other sources than author suggested, and when reviewers nominated by authors are considered, priority should be given to those with different locations from the authors. © 2018 The Author(s).

ECRs want to share but currently accept the closed publishing system because of the need to build a traditional reputation. ECRs know – and appear to care – little about publishers but trust them as publishing and reviewing facilitators. Editors are criticized for not managing peer review with better selection of reviewers. Megajournals are not seen as the future journal form and criticized for lack of selectivity. ECRs want open access/science in principle but are circumspect about their contribution to it. ResearchGate is a key force for change as ECRs consider it a mainstay communication and reputation platform. © 2018 The Author(s).

The growing complexity of traditional assignment agreements is accompanied by researchers’ misunderstanding about their rights. There is a shifting balance between assignment and licensing of rights in an author's work. Academics continue to agree standard assignment contracts even where they disagree with the principles. Publishers are loosening control over copyright in response to demands from funders and a growing minority of researchers. There is a complex range of researchers’ attitudes to copyright issues. © 2018 The Author(s). Learned Publishing © 2018 ALPSP.,,,,,,,"Pan-Massachusetts Challenge

National Institutes of Health","Whilst alternatives to the model of assignment have always existed, perhaps the most important recent trend in this area has been the open access (OA) movement, which has encouraged a greater shift towards the retention of rights in a work by the author and towards granting a license by the author, which controls the publisher’s use of a work. This reflects the moves by funding bodies and others to exercise greater control over the research they sponsor to ensure the widest possible readership. Research bodies have become more proactive in encouraging and sometimes requiring researchers to retain rights, for example, by making funding conditional on publishing research results in an OA forum of some kind. As an example, one of the major funders of science research in the UK, the Wellcome Trust, states its support for ‘unrestricted access to the published output of research as a fundamental part of its charitable mission and as a public benefit to be encouraged wherever possible’ (Wellcome Trust, 2017). This policy is enforced, for example, by requiring all that published research funded in whole or in part by the Trust be made freely available on the OA platforms PubMedCentral (PMC) or Europe PMC. The National Institutes of Health (NIH), a major funder of medical research in the USA, has a similar policy (National Institutes of Health, 2017). These policies are consistent with both main OA models: ‘green’ OA, where published work can be made freely available after an embargo period (e.g. 6 months), and ‘gold’ OA, where published work is made immediately available, with the cost of publishing covered by an article processing charge (APC).",,,"Anderson, K., (2017) Have we reached an inflection point in online collaboration [Web log post]., , https://www.researchinformation.info/news/analysis-opinion/have-we-reached-inflection-point-online-collaboration, 17 August).

This research evaluated articles submitted during 2016 to 149 Wiley-owned journals in two disciplines: medicine (112 journals), and agricultural and biological sciences (37). We compared the reviewer location with the location of the author and the Editor-in-Chief, the size and rank of the journal, and whether the journal had difficulty in obtaining reviews. We found that reviewers mostly came from the USA, but there was a correlation between the reviewer location and the country and region of the Editor-in-Chief and that of the corresponding author.

Previous investigations have used international indexes to track growth, but this article uses the China Academic Journal Network Publishing Database along with Web of Science and SCImago to avoid inclusion bias and analyse the complete landscape of Chinese academic journals (in all disciplines). This article investigated the rate of growth of new journals, the regional distribution of journals, and the quality of the journals (calculated domestically and internationally). Our results indicate that: (1) the average annual growth rate of Chinese academic journals has been 2.74%, but this might probably be affected by different periods of China’s economic and cultural development; (2) the number of journals published in Eastern China is higher than that in Central and Western China; (3) journal quality has improved somewhat in recent years; (4) 84.48% of journals demonstrate domestic impact factors below 1; and (5) China performs better than other developing countries when using the impact factor but equals them when using the SCImago Journal and Country Rank indicator. © 2018 The Author(s).

The present study tries to fill that gap by comparing its coverage with that of other international abstracting and indexing (A&I) databases. Using this measure, it is feasible to benchmark this index against the other citation indexes for acceptance criteria. We analysed 6,296 ESCI-indexed journals, 8,889 Science Citation Index Expanded (SCIE), 3,258 Social Science Citation Index (SSCI), 1,784 Arts and Humanities Citation Index (AHCI), and 22,749 Scopus journals as indexed in July 2017 to determine their inclusion in 105 databases. We found that 19.3% of the ESCI journals are not covered by any other A&I databases, a high figure compared with only 0.5% SCIE, 0.3% SSCI, 0.3% AHCI, and 5.5% Scopus journals. This low coverage suggests that the selection criteria for ESCI journals are not consistent with the overall trend in the other classical citation indexes. © 2018 The Author(s).

The Review of Particle Physics (RPP) series, which is called the bible in the particle physics field, is highly cited by other research papers. The RPP phenomenon is found in different journals and is affected by the host journal's impact factor and publication size. The RPP phenomenon provides a big or small, but temporary, boost to its host journal's impact factor. © 2018 The Author(s).

National Science Foundation","In common with many western publishers, we have seen an increase in the number of original research articles from outside the US/UK/western regions, and these have provided us with some unexpected perspectives – for example, why authors from some regions do not choose western journals for their work (Kurt, 2018). Regional diversity can be a challenge for editors and publishers alike when it comes to balancing perspectives, quality, and workload throughout the editorial processes (Gaston & Smart, 2018). Many journals have been experiencing a tremendous growth of articles from China (indeed, according to the recent National Science Foundation (NSF) statistics, China-based authors are now publishing more than US-based authors: NSF, 2018). Likewise, we have also received and published many more articles from this country in the past decade. Our articles reveal a wealth of research about Chinese research and publishing (e.g. Stanley & Shuai, 2007; Wang, Deng, You, Zhang, & Chen, 2017) and about international publishing partnerships (e.g. Lin & Zhan, 2016). Although regional diversity is often a challenge for publishers, it can also be an opportunity and our articles provide insights into the publishing and research environments in a wide range of countries.",,,"Anderson, R., Why are there virtually no mandatory open access policies at American universities?

In total, 50 journals were randomly selected from Beall's list of ‘predatory’ journals. Different methods, including WHOIS tracking, were utilized to query basic information about the selected journals, including location and registrant. Then, 300 articles were randomly selected from within selected journals in various scientific fields. Authors of the selected articles were contacted and sent survey questions to complete. A grounded theory qualitative methods approach was used for data collection and analysis. The results demonstrated that most of these journals were located in the developing world, usually Asia or Africa, even when they claimed they were in the USA or UK. Furthermore, four themes emerged after authors’ survey responses were coded, categorized, and sub-categorized. The themes were: social identity threat, unawareness, high pressure, and lack of research proficiency. Scholars in the developing world felt that reputable Western journals might be prejudiced against them and sometimes felt more comfortable publishing in journals from the developing world. Other scholars were unaware of the reputation of the journals in which they published and would not have selected them had they known. However, some scholars said they would still have published in the same journals if their institution recognised them. The pressure to ‘publish or perish’ was another factor influencing many scholars’ decisions to publish in these fast-turnaround journals. In some cases, researchers did not have adequate guidance and felt they lacked the knowledge of research to submit to a more reputable journal. More needs to be done by institutions and reputable journals to make researchers aware of the problem of ‘predatory’ journals. © 2018 The Author(s).

Two key trends behind concerns over book and journal models are pressures on funding and the emergence of open access. Despite predictions of a revolution, the academic publishing sector has proved remarkably resilient in adapting to market changes. Whilst showing some support for ‘open science’, even early career researchers remain committed to traditional publishing models. The growth in scholarly collaboration networks and in sharing across traditional boundaries is the more likely disrupter of traditional publishing. © 2017 The Author(s).

The tool looks at the concepts of connectedness, venue representation, and ideational influence using centrality measures within a social network. This research used co-authorships and h-indices to investigate authors who have published papers in the field of information behaviour between 1980 and 2015 as extracted from Web of Science. The findings show a relationship between the authors’ connectedness and the venue (journal) representation. It could be seen that the venue (journal) influences the chance of citation, and equally, the prestige (centrality) of authors probably raises the citations of the journals. The research also shows a significant positive relationship between the venue representation and ideational influence. This means that a research work that is published in a highly cited journal will find more visibility and will receive more citations. © 2017 The Author(s).

The capabilities of unsupervised machine-based tools to create subject collections have improved dramatically. Experts are still likely to find errors and exceptions in automated unsupervised content extractions and need ways to interact with semantic tools. Many semi-automated content solutions require highly skilled and expensive technical staff to develop and maintain them.

We use data recorded by Science Citation Index Expanded, Social Sciences Citation Index, and Journal Citation Reports during 2001–2015 as the main source. We then comparatively analyse the characteristics of natural and social sciences in terms of historical evolution, main contributors, and distribution of OA journals and publications across different languages, disciplines, and impact factor quartiles. Our results suggest that both natural and social sciences experienced dramatic growth of OA journals since 2009, but the share of social science OA journals within journal impact factor quartile 1 is much lower than that of natural sciences. While natural and social sciences share some similarities in OA publishing activities, such as main countries of contribution, they differ greatly in dimensions such as OA ratio across specific disciplines, countries, and publishing languages. We acknowledge that OA publishing offers a level playing field for traditionally disadvantaged languages, countries, and scientific disciplines, but meanwhile, the advancement of high-quality OA publishing needs more targeted and sophisticated approaches to tackle differences in natural and social sciences. © 2017 The Author(s).

This paper investigates the current usage of DOIs in China. Using an isometric method, we sampled 238 core Chinese academic journals from the Chinese Science and Technical Journal Citation Reports (2015 version, Core Edition), which includes 2,383 journals in total. According to our investigation, we found that: (1) although 80.25% of journals assign DOIs, 42.41% have only assigned DOIs to articles published after 2010; (2) most journals (89.01%) register DOIs through Institute of Scientific and Technical Information of China; and (3) only 84.82% of journals that register DOIs include them in the articles. This paper looks at the reasons for the limited implementation of DOIs and makes suggestions as to how usage can be expanded in China. © 2017 The Author(s).

However, there are still limited data for many fields, including aquatic sciences. Using papers published in 2003–2005 (n = 785), we investigated marine and freshwater biology articles to identify factors that may contribute to the probability of citation and for cumulative citation counts over 10 years. We found no relationships with probability of citation; however, we found evidence that for those that were cited at least once, cumulative citations were related to several factors. Articles cited by books received more citations than those never cited by books, which we hypothesized to be indicative of the impact an article may have in the field. We also found that articles first cited within 2 years of publication received more cumulative citations than those first cited after 2 years. We found no evidence that self-citation (as the first citation) had a significant effect on total citations. Our findings were compared with previous studies in other disciplines, and it was found that aquatic science citation patterns are comparable to fields in science and technology but less so to humanities and social sciences. © 2017 The Author(s).

The five major strategies of content marketing are promotion, personalization, targeting, consumerization, and analysis and optimization. Publishers must treat readers as customers, not simply as end users. Content marketing is about the environment in which content exists, as well as the form that it takes. To compete with pirate sites, publishers need to provide a richer user experience. Content marketing benefits authors and readers as well as publishers. Readers want the same enjoyable user experience and tailored content on all sites they visit. Content marketing can increase site traffic, lengthen visits, boost revenues, thwart piracy, and heighten brand impact. © 2017 The Author(s).

It shows that research on open data has grown rapidly since 2009 with the development of various open data initiatives. We identify the different themes using science mapping and performance analysis. The most important themes are semantic web, open government, and crowdsourcing. The basic and transversal themes are data sharing and public sector information. As for the emerging themes, these are Big Data and open government data. In addition, data journalism, monitoring, and recommender systems are specific themes that deserve special attention. The UK and the USA are the leading publishing countries, both in theoretical and practical research on open data. In China, most researchers focus on practical research, and there have been efforts to promote the development of open data. Papers introducing large-scale projects receive more attention and citation quickly. Recently, researchers have been publishing more on objective topics, including possible issues and dilemmas in the era of Big Data and many problems such as budgets, ownership, licensing, culture, and sustainable development. © 2017 The Author(s).

Reframing accessibility as improving the overall user experience instantly changes the perspective; accessibility becomes a critical requirement worthy of investment and resources. The single most prevalent complaint amongst librarians is the time it takes to get hold of accessible content. An accessibility roadmap provides structure and transparency for digital accessibility projects within the organization.

They are based on standard web accessibility guidelines that are commonly used globally, and the format for interchange is EPUB, a format many publishers already produce in their normal production process. Nevertheless, accessibility still proves difficult to accomplish for most publishers. This article refers to informal interviews and the author's own experiences to examine the issues that are challenging to publishers and their suppliers, assessing the level of effort required to address them, discussing the factors that make them difficult, and suggesting strategies for reducing the effort required.

It is often difficult to find supplier information on accessibility, for example, whether files have been tagged for reading order or whether the interface has been tested with assistive technologies. Equally, library staff may lack confidence in identifying accessibility features, making it hard to promote them to students or demand them from suppliers. This article reports on a crowdsourced e-book audit of 44 e-book platforms that was undertaken by 33 UK universities during 2016. The research scored different platforms for a range of accessibility issues, and the resulting open data set is presented in a manner that can be interrogated by libraries looking for specific features. A key finding was that the platform can dramatically affect the accessibility of a publisher's content, making it important for publishers to work with suitable vendors to disseminate their publications. © 2018 The Author(s). Learned Publishing © 2018 ALPSP.",,,,,,,,"Changes to the Disabled Student Allowance (DSA) for higher education in England in 2016 removed key entitlements from the support process. Higher education institutions (HEIs) could no longer ‘make do’ with inaccessible resources, relying on DSA funding to bridge any accessibility gaps. This resulted in a significant cultural shift. Purchasing accessible content was no longer an aspirational goal but a financial and legal necessity. Every barrier to access required direct funding from the HEI to fix. Previously hidden costs in e-books and e-book platforms were suddenly very visible. What was still invisible was objective information about the accessibility credentials of the platforms and products licensed from suppliers.",,,"(2012) National occupational standards for publishing, , https://www.publishingtrainingcentre.co.uk/images/BookJournalPublishingNationalStandards.pdf, London, England, Book and Journal Publishing, Retrieved from; Dobson, V., McNaught, A., Crowdsourcing e-book accessibility information and the impact on staff development (2017) Insights, 30 (2), pp. 61-70; (2016) E-book accessibility audit, , https://sites.google.com/site/ebookaudit2016/, Retrieved from; (2016) E-book accessibility audit – Platforms to be tested, , https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1UofqQMWpLBNXwEKaCDxuMT652w5bJ0GZLrJSAIV0IhU/edit#gid=1413833512, Retrieved from; (2016) E-book accessibility audit, , https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd3CNbXwhrdFDFYNV_Z2QKoqsghlmcb5So-Yq0fviLHoLJ7pA/viewform, Retrieved from; (2016) Text summary of scoring system, , https://sites.google.com/site/ebookaudit2016/data-and-related-fileds, Retrieved from; (2016) Interactive scoring – Beta liteupload, , https://sites.google.com/site/ebookaudit2016/data-and-related-fileds, Retrieved from; (2016) E-book Audit 2016, , https://sites.google.com/site/ebookaudit2016/, Retrieved from; (2016) The process – confidence & caveats, , https://sites.google.com/site/ebookaudit2016/key-stats-and-caveats, Retrieved from; (2016) Impact document, , https://sites.google.com/site/ebookaudit2016/assignments/e-bookaccessibilityaudit2016promotion, Retrieved from; (2016) E-book audit – How can we help?

Specifically, the aims of the paper are to show: (1) how much experience and knowledge ECRs had of peer review – both as authors and as reviewers; (2) what they felt the benefits were and what suggestions they had for improvement; (3) what they thought of open peer review (OPR); and (4) who they felt should organize peer review. Data were obtained from 116 science and social science ECRs, most of whom had published and were subject to in-depth interviews conducted face-to-face, via Skype, or over the telephone. An extensive literature review was also conducted to provide a context and supplementary data for the findings. The main findings were that: (1) most ECRS are well informed about peer review and generally like the experience, largely because of the learning experiences obtained; (2) they like blind double-peer review, but would like some improvements, especially with regards to reviewer quality; (3) most are uncomfortable with the idea of OPR; and (4) most would like publishers to continue organizing peer review because of their perceived independence. © 2017 The Author(s).

This becomes more complicated as the selection criteria may vary from one discipline to another. Therefore, appropriate cross-disciplinary studies are required to understand the exact concerns that dominate a particular field. The current study compares 16 factors that influence journal choices between medicine and social sciences using the answers given to a global survey of 235 open access journal authors. The results reveal that authors of both areas consider ‘peer reviewed’ status as the most important factor while showing the least interest to the ‘number of annual subscribers’ of the journal. However, compared to social science authors, those in the discipline of medicine give significantly more consideration to (1) impact factor, (2) the inclusion of the journal in abstracting and indexing services, (3) publisher’s prestige, and (4) online submission with tracking facility. The factors that were identified can be categorized for both disciplines as reflecting the reputation of a journal, performance or production issues, and reliability and demand characteristics of their publication choice. The editors and publishers can use these findings to attract the best manuscripts as the study reveals the author’s perception of the journal’s status. The results can also be used to design recommender systems for journal submission for new authors in a discipline. © 2017 The Author(s).

Megajournals (of which PLoS One is the best known example) represent a relatively new approach to scholarly communication and can be characterized as large, broad-scope, open access journals that take an innovative approach to peer review, basing acceptance decisions solely on the technical or scientific soundness of the article. This model is often said to support the broader goals of the open science movement. Based on in-depth interviews with 31 publishers and editors representing 16 different organizations (10 of which publish a megajournal), this paper reports how the term ‘megajour-nal’ is understood and publishers’ rationale and motivations for launching (or not launching) an OAMJ. We find that while there is general agreement on the common characteristics of megajournals, there is not yet a consensus on their relative importance. We also find seven motivating factors that were said to drive the launch of an OAMJ and link each of these factors to potential societal and business benefits. These results suggest that the often polarized debate surrounding OAMJs is a consequence of the extent to which observers perceive publishers to be motivated by these societal or business benefits. © 2017 The Author(s).",,,,,,,"Arts and Humanities Research Council, AHRC: AH/M010643/1",The research was funded by a grant from the UK Arts and Humanities Research Council (AH/M010643/1).

Drawing on a range of databases, articles, and reference sources, it provides unique insights. In contrast to the UK/US model of scholarly communication, in Korea, most scholarly journals are published by discipline-based scholarly societies and research institutes affiliated to universities. Payment for publication is the norm, and typically features article processing charges and scholarly society membership fees for both OA and toll access (TA) journals. Online access to journals in Korea is provided by commercial vendors who enter into contracts with the scholarly societies for exclusive use. Three online access models apply – TA, gold OA, and dual access – with the use of these models varying between disciplines. In parallel with this access provided by commercial vendors, there are a number of government-funded open access repositories (OARs) to which university researchers are requested to deposit their research outputs, as well as OARs run by universities and other research institutes. © 2017 The Author(s).

However, little is known about editorial processes related to appeals and their outcomes. Our research investigated the number of appeals against rejected manuscripts, their success rates, and the current editorial processes for managing appeals amongst biomedical journals. We sent out an e-mail survey to a sample of 20 editorial teams worldwide, between January and August 2016. A descriptive summary of e-mail responses from editorial teams was collated. We found considerable variations in appeal processes amongst journals, with little evidence of any detailed, reproducible, or established appeal policies in operation. Journals disclosed limited information on the number of appeals received and their success rates. The credibility of an appeal process relies on robust, reproducible, and evidence-based policies, which do not seem to be currently established amongst biomedical journals. Further empirical evidence is needed to ascertain how variations in the appeal process may relate to successful publication. © 2017 The Author(s) and 2017 ALPSP.",,,,,,,"National Institute for Health Research, NIHR","We thank Ginny Barbour, Chair at COPE, for the helpful suggestions at the start of the project and for reviewing the draft versions of this paper.

Given this situation, knowing more about the characteristics of who provides peer review and peer reviewer behaviour could be helpful to editors and journals. This study focused on peer reviewer gender and examined differences in review behaviour by gender among 2,178 peer reviewers for two behavioural science journals over a period of 9 years. Analyses revealed that women were significantly more likely to accept review invitations and took more time to complete reviews than men. We found no gender differences for the total number of invitations to review or for days to respond to invitations. We discuss the implications of these results in terms of concerns about obtaining peer review and for future research on peer review. © 2017 The Author(s) and 2017 ALPSP.",,,,,,,,,,,"Albert, A.Y.K., Gow, J.L., Cobra, A., Vines, T.H., (2016) Is it becoming harder to secure reviewers for peer review?

Indexed by Journal Citation Reports - Science Citation Index Expanded (JCR-SCIE), journals published in China, Japan, India, Singapore, South Korea, and Taiwan between the years 2008 and 2012 are collected and analysed using bibliometrics and statistics methods. Results showed that the mean impact factor (IF) value of the journals from all countries was less than 1.3 throughout the period. Only journals from China and Japan had a mean IF or 5-year IF (5Y-IF) value exceeding 1. The self-cited rate of the journals from South Korea remained the highest among selected countries but showed a declining trend every year. The selfcited rates among journals from all the six Asian countries did not considerably affect the journals’ IF values. The results revealed that the IF-based ranking factor (IF-RF) of Chinese and Japanese journals in various subject fields constantly improved from 2008 to 2012, but this improvement trend was not observed in journals from the other four countries. Overall, the journals from Japan and China demonstrated stronger impacts than those from the other countries. © 2017 The Author(s) and 2017 ALPSP.",,,,,,,"National Science Council, NSC: NSC102-2410-H-032-086","This work is supported by National Science Council of Taiwan under grant NSC102-2410-H-032-086.

The study recruited 116 science and social science ECRs from seven countries who were subject to in-depth interviews, and this paper reports on findings regarding publishing and authorship practices and attitudes. A major objective was to determine whether ECRs are taking the myriad opportunities proffered by new digital innovations, developing within the context of open science, open access, and social media, to publish their research. The main finding is that these opportunities are generally not taken because ECRs are constrained by convention and the precarious employment environment they inhabit and know what is best for them, which is to publish (in high impact factor journals) or perish. © 2017 The Author(s) and 2017 ALPSP.",,,,,,,,,,,"Borrego, Á., Anglada, L., Faculty information behaviour in the electronic environment: Attitudes towards searching, publishing and libraries (2016) New Library World, 117 (3-4), pp. 173-185. , https://doi.org/10.1108/NLW-11-2015-0089; Brand, A., Allen, L., Altman, M., Hlava, M., Scott, J., Beyond authorship: Attribution, contribution, collaboration, and credit (2015) Learned Publishing, 28 (2), pp. 151-155. , https://doi.org/10.1087/20150211; Brechelmacher, A., Park, E., Ates, G., Campbell, D.F., The rocky road to tenure - Career paths in academia (2015) Academic work and careers in Europe: Trends, challenges, perspectives, pp. 13-40. , T.

At the same time, scientists are apparently willing to share copies of their publications on academic social networking sites. This paper compares the availability of the scholarly output in the institutional repositories of 13 top Spanish universities and in ResearchGate (RG). Results show that just 11.1% of the articles published in 2014 by researchers at these universities were available in their institutional repository in the first quarter of 2016. However, most of the articles that were not available in institutional repositories (84.5%) were published in journals that allow the deposit of the article in some form. In contrast, 54.8% of the articles were available in full text on RG. When authors who had uploaded copies of their articles to RG but not to their institutional repository were asked about their reasons, most replies focused on two issues: ignorance about the existence or operation of the institutional repository and awareness of the advantages offered by RG. © 2017 The Author(s) and 2017 ALPSP.",,,,,,,,The author thanks Prof. Stephen Pinfield at the University of Sheffield Information School for his valuable comments and suggestions to improve the manuscript.,,,"Björk, B.-C., Laakso, M., Welling, P., Paetau, P., Anatomy of green open access (2014) Journal of the Association for Information Science and Technology, 65 (2), pp. 237-250. , https://doi.org/10.1002/asi.22963; Borrego, A., Measuring compliance with a Spanish government open access mandate (2016) Journal of the Association for Information Science and Technology, 67 (4), pp. 757-764. , https://doi.org/10.1002/asi.23422; Creswell, J.W., Plano Clark, V.L., (2011) Designing and conducting mixed methods research, , (2nd ed.).

The quantitative survey method adopted to collect data from local researchers was based on an instrument developed and used by CIBER. Their notions and practices involved in deciding trust and quality of scholarly journals were obtained. The findings revealed that national and institutional policies have significantly influenced their decisions regarding the publishing outlets. The credibility of indexing services was found to be an important factor in choosing the journal for publishing research. ISI Web of Science Impact Factor was not considered as the top source for determining quality and trustworthiness. This study is the first of its kind that targets the top two universities of the country. A comparison of the findings with another international study shows that some of the behavioural traits are compatible with scholars from less-developed countries like India and China, while others are more similar to the ones from highly developed countries like USA and UK. © 2016 The Author(s) and ALPSP.",,,,,,,"Nanjing University of Science and Technology, NUST","The author acknowledges the funding received from the University of the Punjab for conducting this study.

This study implements the four core variables of the recently published Open Access Spectrum (OAS) (reader rights, reuse rights, copyright, and author posting rights) to measure the level of openness in all 1,728 Spanish scholarly journals listed in the Spanish national DULCINEA database at the end of 2015. Data exported from the database and used as variables for the analysis were: journal research area, type of publisher, type of access, selfarchiving and reuse policy, and type of Creative Commons (CC) licence used. Out of the total number of journals (1,728), 1,285 (74.5%) published their articles OA immediately after initial publication and thus received the maximum OAS score for reader rights; 37.5% of all journals used CC licences, and 79.5% allowed self-archiving in some form. In 72% of journals, authors retained or publishers granted broad rights, which included author reuse and authorization rights (for others to reuse), whilst 13.5% did not specify any terms for copyright transfer.

ECRs were interviewed in their own languages face-to-face, by Skype, or telephone. The study focused on the attitudes and behaviours of ECRs with respect to scholarly communications and the extent to which they are adopting new and disruptive technologies, such as social media, online communities, and Open Science. The main findings include: publishing in highimpact factor journals is the only reputational game in town; online scholarly communities, and ResearchGate in particular, are gaining ground; social media are beginning to have an impact, especially in the dissemination arena; outreach activities have become more important; libraries are becoming increasingly invisible to ECRs; Open Science is not gaining traction; and more transformational ideas are being expressed, especially in the US and UK. © 2016 The Author(s) and ALPSP.",,,,,,,,,,,"Belluz, J., Plumer, B., Resnick, B., (2016) The 7 Biggest Problems Facing Science, according to 270 Scientists, , http://www.vox.com/2016/7/14/12016710/science-challeges-research-funding-peer-review-process, 14 July, [Web log post].

The research looks particularly at differences between authors based in countries with a gross domestic product per capita less or greater than US$18,000 (called periphery and core countries, respectively). The data were obtained with an online survey sent to 107,296 scholars listed on the mailing lists belonging to De Gruyter Open from December 2015 to January 2016. A total of 1,012 responses were received. Authors from the periphery countries publish their articles in gold OA more often and they also pay OA publication fees equally often as those based in the core countries. The reasons for that are complex, involving both their preference to publish in OA and the composition of the publishing market in the periphery. © 2016 The Author(s) and ALPSP.",,,,,,,,,,,"Babones, S., The country-level income structure of the worldeconomy (2015) Journal of World-Systems Research, 11 (1), pp. 29-55; Canagarajah, A.S., Nondiscursive requirements in academic publishing, material resources of periphery scholars, and the politics of knowledge production (1996) Written Communication, 13 (4), pp. 435-472; (2016) Directory of Open Access Journals, , https://doaj.org/search#.V6t3GT_sQ1g, Doaj.org, Retrieved from; Figshare, (2016) Key Challenges of Research communication—De Gruyter Open Author’s Survey, , https://figshare.com/articles/Key_Challenges_of_Research_Communication_-_De_Gruyter_Open_Author_s_Survey_2016/3425738, Retrieved from; Garfield, E., Mapping science in the Third World (1983) Science and Public Policy, 10 (3), pp. 112-127; Guédon, J.C., (2008) Open Access and the Divide between “mainstream” and “peripheral” Science, , http://eprints.rclis.org/10778/, Retrieved from; Laakso, M., Björk, B.C., Anatomy of open access publishing: A study of longitudinal development and internal structure (2012) BMC Medicine, 10 (1), 1p; Larivière, V., Haustein, S., Mongeon, P., The oligopoly of academic publishers in the digital era (2015) Plos ONE, 10 (6); Leśniak, A., Morys-Twarowski, M., Siewicz, K., Starczewski, M., Stępinska-Ustasiak, L., Szprot, J., (2015) Open Science in Poland 2014: A Diagnosis, , Warsaw, Poland: Wydawnictwa ICM.

By using Web of Science’s Science Citation Index Expanded (SCIE, 1900–2015), Social Sciences Citation Index (SSCI, 1900–2015), and Arts and Humanities Citation Index (A&HCI, 1975–2015), this study probes the patterns and dynamics of non-English papers by year, citation index, and discipline using bibliometric analysis. The analyses show that English is increasingly being used as the dominating language from natural sciences and social sciences to arts and humanities. Around 97% of the papers in SCIE, 95% of the papers in SSCI, and 73% of the papers in A&HCI during the past decade were in English. However, other languages such as German and French were also used as important academic languages in sciences and social sciences during the first half of the 20th century, 1970s, and 1980s. Unlike natural science and social science disciplines, non-English papers have consistently played important role in arts and humanities disciplines from the beginning of 1975. Although the shares of non-English papers in SCIE and SSCI databases have been limited during the past decade, a large number of non-English papers can be found in some applied disciplines of sciences and social sciences. © 2016 The Author(s) and ALPSP.",,,,,,,"University of Manchester

If this can be proven to be true, then subject areas with this type of educational impact could justify claims for enhanced funding. To seek evidence of disciplinary differences in the direct educational uptake of journal articles, but ignoring books, conference papers, and other scholarly outputs, this paper assesses the total number and proportions of student readers of academic articles in Mendeley across 12 different subjects. The results suggest that whilst few students read mathematics research articles, in other areas, the number of student readers is broadly proportional to the number of research readers. Although the differences in the average numbers of undergraduate readers of articles varies by up to 50 times between subjects, this could be explained by the differing levels of uptake of Mendeley rather than the differing educational value of disciplinary research. Overall, then, the results do not support the claim that journal articles in some areas have substantially more educational value than average for academia, compared with their research value. © 2016 The Author(s) and ALPSP.",,,,,,,,,,,"Ambrose, S.A., Bridges, M.W., Dipietro, M., Lovett, M.C., Norman, M.K., (2010) How Learning Works: Seven Research-Based Principles for Smart Teaching, , New York, NY: John Wiley & Sons; Becher, T., Trowler, P.R., (2001) Academic Tribes and Territories: Intellectual Inquiry and the Culture of Disciplines, , 2nd ed.).

It is so entwined in the daily work life of scholars that it has almost become second nature, an integral part of the research process itself. This article addresses this often overlooked area of research in usage studies. In an international survey of 1,000 published scholars, the Beyond Downloads project examined their sharing behaviours in order to gain a more contextualized and accurate picture of their usage beyond download patterns and citation counts. Scholars share published articles with others as a mode of content discovery and dissemination, particularly if they work in groups, and most expect to increase their sharing in the future. While their methods of sharing articles may change, and their reasons for sharing may vary from self-promotion to the more altruistic motives of scientific progress, they desire to share the final published versions of articles with their colleagues. © 2016 The Author(s) and ALPSP.",,,,,,,,,,,"Flanagan, J.C., The critical incident technique (1954) Psychological Bulletin, 51 (4), pp. 327-358; Ge, X., Information-seeking behavior in the digital age: A multidisciplinary study of academic researchers (2010) College & Research Libraries, 71 (5), pp. 435-455; Gruzd, A., Staves, K., Wilk, A., Connected scholars: Examining the role of social media in research practices of faculty using the UTAUT model (2012) Computers in Human Behavior, 28 (6), pp. 2340-2350; Gusterson, H., Want to change academic publishing?

The project is a 3-year longitudinal study of early career researchers (ECRs) to ascertain their current and changing habits with regard to information searching, use, sharing, and publication. The study recruited 116 researchers from seven countries (UK, USA, China, France, Malaysia, Poland, and Spain) and performed in-depth interviews by telephone, Skype, or face-to-face to discover behaviours and opinions. This paper reports on findings regarding discovery and access to scholarly information. Findings confirm the universal popularity of Google/Google Scholar. Library platforms and web-scale discovery services are largely unmentioned and unnoticed by this user community, although many ECRs pass through them unknowingly on the way to authenticated use of their other preferred sources, such as Web of Science. ECRs are conscious of the benefits of open access in delivering free access to papers. Social media are widely used as a source of discovering scholarly information. ResearchGate is popular and on the rise in all countries surveyed. Smartphones have become a regularly used platform on which to perform quick and occasional searches for scholarly information but are only rarely used for reading full text. © 2016 The Author(s) and ALPSP.",,,,,,,"Ministry of Higher Education, Malaysia, MOHE: UM.C/HIR/MOHE/FCSIT/11

The featured publications strive to address limitations in scholarly content discovery and access experiences to expand our understanding of the researcher experience and to influence positive change for all stakeholders. With original research findings or well-cited expert analysis, the reviewed papers outline the dominant channels of scholarly content discovery channels and demonstrate how trends fluctuate by the type of user and their information needs, as well as a wide variety of demographics. Best practices in metadata management, standards, and crosssector collaboration are also discussed. Together, the publications reviewed here validate the importance of user-centric, evidence-based, and standards-compliant approaches to learned resource development and dissemination. © 2016 The Author(s) and ALPSP.",,,,,,,,,,,"Al Shboul, M.K., Abrizah, A., Modes of information seeking: Developing personas of humanities scholars (2016) Information Development, 32 (5), pp. 1786-1805; Breeding, M., (2015), http://www.niso.org/apps/group_public/download.php/14487/future_library_resource:discovery.pdf, National Information Standards Organization (U.S.), The future of library resource discovery: A white paper commissioned by the NISO Discovery to Delivery (D2D) Topic Committee; Faherty, A., (2016) Academic Book Discovery, Evaluation and Access, , https://academicbookfuture.files.wordpress.com/2016/06/faherty_academic-book-discovery-full-report.pdf; Gardner, T., Inger, S., (2016) How Readers Discover Content in Scholarly Publications: Trends in Reader Behaviour from 2005 to 2015, , http://www.simoningerconsulting.com/papers/How%20Readers%20Discover%20Content%20in%20Scholarly%20Publications.pdf; Perruso, C., Undergraduates use of Google vs. Library Resources: A four-year cohort study (2016) College & Research Libraries, 77 (5), pp. 614-630; Pontis, S., Blandford, A., Greifeneder, E., Attalla, H., Neal, D., Keeping up to date: An academic researcher’s information journey (2015) Journal of the Association for Information Science and Technology; Priestner, A., Marshall, D., (2016), https://futurelib.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/the-snapshot-project.pdf, Snapshot: A cultural probe study exploring the research and information behaviour of postdocs and PhD students at the University of Cambridge.

The methodology included a comprehensive literature review of both published and ‘grey’ literature, such as blog posts and press releases. Eight interviews were also conducted with stakeholders representing different parts of the scholarly publishing landscape. Strategies of conversion for different types of journals are presented at multiple levels (publishers, national, research funders, organizational, and so on). The identified scenarios are split into two main categories, those that rely heavily on article processing charges and those that can operate without relying on author-side financing. Despite there being interesting and important shared traits among many converted journals, individual circumstances largely dictate what options for conversion are viable for a journal. There is no single solution that works for every journal but rather a broad selection of different solutions, among which selection should be well informed. © 2016 The Author(s).",,,,,,,,,,,"Bianco, S., Ellestad, O.H., Ferreira, P., Friend, F., Gargiulo, P., Hanania, R., Zioutas, K., (2007) Towards Open Access Publishing in High Energy Physics, , http://cds.cern.ch/record/1034368/files/open-2007-015.pdf?version=1, Geneva, Switzerland: CERN.

It investigated how academic professionals in medical sciences implement peer convenience editing (CE) to improve articles and make them suitable for publication. The research identified nine editing interventions that were categorized as micro-or macro-editing strategies. The findings indicated that the most frequently used strategies are microstrategies of substitution, addition, and mechanical alteration. The study also found that the abstract received the majority of editorial changes (mostly micro), followed by the introduction and then the discussion sections.

Some of those papers include simple and/or complex math. Authors have at their disposal multiple means to insert equations in Word documents, including several of Word’s native equation editors and third-party applications, such as Design Science’s MathType. Building workflows that smoothly and accurately transform all of these formats into the appropriate XML markup for use in multiple rendering environments has many challenges. This paper clarifies the different forms of equations that can be encountered in Word documents and discusses the issues and idiosyncrasies of converting these various forms to MathML, LaTeX, and/or images in the JATS XML model. It also touches on workflow alternatives for handling equations in various rendering environments and how those downstream requirements may affect the means of equation extraction from Word documents. © 2016 The Author(s).",,,,,,,,,,,"(2015) JATS: Journal Article Tag Suite, , http://www.niso.org/apps/group_public/download.php/15933/z39_96-2015.pdf, ANSI/NISO Z39.96-2015, version 1.1.1.

It presents an integrated approach to the concept of a business model, looking at (1) economics and finances, (2) operation, and (3) the strategic dimensions of the publishing activities. It is based on a cluster analysis of 327 journals that responded to a survey carried out between November 2012 and March 2013. Our findings revealed four business models that differed mostly in the economic and financial dimensions. The greatest difference between the clusters was in the distribution of expenses, and two different operational patterns were revealed by the allocation of staff and volunteer resources. The main barrier to open access was perceived to be financial limitations by three clusters and organizational structure by one cluster, with the subscription-based journals least likely to be open access or to be tempted to become open access. © 2016 The Author(s).",,,,,,,,,,,"Abad-García, F., González-Teruel, A., Martínez-Catalán, C., Characteristics of Spanish medical journals (2005) El Profesional De La Información, 14 (5), pp. 380-390; Amit, R., Zott, C., Value creation in E-business (2001) Strategic Management Journal, 22 (6-7), pp. 493-520; Björk, B.C., Open access to scientific publications – An analysis of the barriers to change (2004) Information Research, 9 (2), p. 170; Björk, B.C., Solomon, D., Open access versus subscription journals: A comparison of scientific impact (2012) BMC Medicine, 10 (1), p. 73; Chesbrough, H., Rosenbloom, R.S., The role of the business model in capturing value from innovation: Evidence from Xerox Corporation’s technology spin-off companies (2002) Industrial and Corporate Change, 11 (3), pp. 529-555; Chi Chang, C., Business models for open access journals publishing (2006) Online Information Review, 30 (6), pp. 699-713; Courant, P.N., Jones, E.A., Scholarly publishing as an economic public good (2015) Getting the Word out Academic Libraries as Scholarly Publishers, pp. 17-42. , M.

The research objective was to identify the investigative tendencies that characterize the subject. The analysis studied documents indexed by Web of Science and Scopus databases. About 253 documents were retrieved, showing a growth in articles 2005–2015. We discovered that the most productive authors, journals, institutions, and countries were from Europe and North America. The collaboration networks between authors and institutions reveal a homogenous community formed by the most prolific contributors. The most explored subjects deal with (1) social media and networking, (2) internet, (3) scholarly and scientific communication and publication, (4) open access and public libraries, (5) citation analysis, (6) impact factor measurements, (7) metric disciplines, (8) information analysis, retrieval, and processing, (9) search engines and data bases, and (10) evaluative bibliometrics. We discovered a nucleus of contributors who have attempted to solidify the knowledge area, with emerging principles of high theoretical consistency. © 2016 The Author(s).",,,,,,,,,,,"Alperin, J.P., Ask not what altmetrics can do for you, but what altmetrics can do for developing countries (2013) Bulletin of the American Society for Information Science and Technology, 39 (4), pp. 18-21; Barbic, D., Tubman, M., Lam, H., Barbic, S., An analysis of altmetrics in emergency medicine (2016) Academic Emergency Medicine, 23, pp. 251-268; Binfield, P., PLoS ONE: Background, future development, and article-level metrics (2009) Proceedings of the 13Th International Conference on Electronic Publishing, ELPUB 2009, pp. 69-86. , Milan, Italy; Bollen, J., Van De Sompel, H., Smith, J.A., Luce, R., Toward alternative metrics of journal impact: A comparison of download and citation data (2005) Information Processing and Management, 41 (6), pp. 1419-1440; Bornmann, L., Do altmetrics point to the broader impact of research?

In 2012, it adopted an evaluation tool to assist journals in improving their style and format to meet international standards. This study analysed reliability and fitness of this tool. The 34 evaluation items were tested for goodness of fit, and item analysis was performed for 540 journals based on classical test theory, the Rasch model, and a two-parameter logistic model. The tool was found to be reliable, with a Cronbach’s alpha value of 0.94. Based on the goodness of fit test, the outfit mean square was over 2.0 (i.e. outlier) for the following four items: participation in editor training courses, turnover in editors in the most recent 10 years, publishing at least 40 articles annually, and online accessibility. Three items were found to be the most difficult to be fulfilled: participation in editor training courses, description of the length of time the journal has been publishing, and full-text XML. Above results indicated that this tool was acceptable for measuring the parameters assessed by the items.

It examines articles published in Journalism and Mass Communication Quarterly (JMCQ) between 2012 and 2014. The results indicate that the total online usage (full article and abstract page views and article downloads) can be a very strong predictor for citations and can even wipe out the effects of hot topics. Mobile and social media are the media of study most cited in the articles studied. There is no identifiable gender citation gap as authors of both genders equally enjoy their share in the top 10 most cited list. The only gender-related finding is that female authors dominate gender-related topics. We conclude that journal publishers wishing to obtain a quick proxy measure of citation potential for journal articles should consult their total online usage. Furthermore, due to the prevalent bias on topics regarding citation frequency, administrators and librarians are highly advised to take topics into consideration when determining scholars’ citation performance. © 2016 ALPSP.",,,,,,,,,,,"Bollen, J., Van De Sompel, H., Hagberg, A., Bettencourt, L., Chute, R., Rodriguez, M.A., Balakireva, L., Clickstream data yields high-resolution maps of science (2009) Plos One, 4 (3); Bollen, J., Van De Sompel, H., Smith, J.A., Luce, R., Toward alternative metrics of journal impact: A comparison of download and citation data (2005) Information Processing and Management, 41 (6), pp. 1419-1440; Borrego, A., Barrios, M., Villarroya, A., Ollé, C., Scientific output and impact of postdoctoral scientists: A gender perspective (2010) Scientometrics, 83 (1), pp. 93-101; Brody, T., Harnad, S., Carr, L., Earlier web usage statistics as predictors of later citation impact (2006) Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology, 57 (8), pp. 1060-1072; Calver, M.C., Bradley, J.S., Patterns of citations of open access and non-open access conservation biology journal papers and book chapters (2010) Conservation Biology, 24 (3), pp. 872-880; Cameron, B.D., Trends in the usage of ISI bibliometric data: Uses, abuses, and implications (2005) Portal: Libraries and the Academy, 5 (1), pp. 105-125; Delgado, E., Repiso, R., The impact of scientific journals of communication: Comparing Google Scholar metrics, Web of Science and Scopus (2013) Comunicar, 21, pp. 45-52; Duy, J., Vaughan, L., Can electronic journal usage data replace citation data as a measure of journal use?

It is part of a wider study gauging quality and trustworthiness in scholarly communication in the emerging digital environment. The survey questionnaire was distributed between 1 October 2014 and 31 January 2015. A total of 391 respondents, from four research areas (humanities, life sciences, physical sciences, and social sciences) completed the questionnaire. The finding indicated that motivations for citing were complex and multi-faceted, but in all four disciplines, researchers cite a work because they regard it as an authoritative and trustworthy source, which provides a context or building block to their own research. Although researchers have moved from a print-based system to a digital one, it has not significantly changed the way they decide what to trust. Peer reviewed journals are still the most influential. Open access journals will be cited if they have been peer reviewed. Citing on the basis of high altmetrics and other social judgements, such as mentions, likes, and use, was not prevalent. Measures of establishing trust and authority do not seem to have changed profoundly in Malaysia. © 2016 ALPSP.",,,,,,,,,,,"Abrizah, A., Badawi, F., Zoohorian-Fooladi, N., Nicholas, D., Jamali, H., Norliya, A.K., Trust and authority in the periphery of world scholarly communication: A malaysian focus group study (2015) Malaysian Journal of Library & Information Science, 20 (2), pp. 67-83; Bornmann, L., Daniel, H.D., What do citation counts measure?

Success is defined as being indexed in international databases such as SCI (Science Citation Index) and Ei (Engineering Index) Compendex databases. Our research shows that 226 CELJs (57.8%) have an international publishing partnership with publishers such as Springer, Elsevier, and Wiley. A survey of 12 CELJs in Hubei Province, China, shows that 75% journals have financial pressures on the journal operation. The Journal of Rock Mechanics and Geotechnical Engineering (JRMGE) is provided as an illustration of the operation costs of CELJs and to demonstrate the associated financial pressures. We conclude that although international partnership is an on-going fashion at present in China, it has both benefits and limitations. We also propose that to reduce the financial pressure on CELJs, government funding should be differently apportioned, providing a better return on investment (ROI). © 2016 ALPSP.",,,,,,,,,,,"(2015), http://www.cessp.org.cn/ch/reader/view_news.aspx?id=20150914154927001, 2015 7th Seminar on the Development and Innovation of Chinese Scientific and Technical Journals; (2012), http://www.cast.org.cn/n35081/n35096/n13118139/14041176.html, Notice of the ability improvement of outstanding scientific societies and international scientific and technical journals; (2013), http://www.cast.org.cn/n35081/n35488/15134546.html, Notice of international influence of Chinese Scientific Journals enhancement program review result; http://www.cast.org.cn/n35081/n35488/16319549.html, [Circular on scientific and technical journals plans to enhance the international visibility of 2015 Class D projects]; (2015), http://cjstp.ijournals.cn/cjstp/ch/reader/view_news.aspx?id=20151129102543522, The 25th Symposium of STM Journals Society, Chinese Academy of Sciences; (2015), http://www.gapp.gov.cn/zongshu/magazine.shtml, Journal/periodical press inquiry; Lin, S., (2015) The 391 Celjs in China, , https://figshare.com/articles/The_391_CELJs_in_China/1594697/1; Lin, S., Zhan, L., Dong, Y., (2014) Chinese Journal of Scientific and Technical Periodicals, 25 (7), pp. 919-925; Ma, Z., Yu, Z., Pan, Y., (2014) Chinese Journal of Scientific and Technical Periodicals, 25 (10), pp. 1277-1281; Ren, S., (2014), http://blog.sciencenet.cn/blog38899-796389.html; Ren, S., (2015) Science-Technology & Publication, 2, pp. 9-13; (2015), http://www.hbessp.org.cn/xuehuidongtai/xinwen/2015/0408/541.html; Taylor, M., (2012) Academic Publishers have Become the Enemies of Science, , http://www.theguardian.com/science/2012/jan/16/academic-publishers-enemies-science; Http://Sparceurope.Org/Oaca; Van Noorden, R., (2013), http://www.nature.com/news/open-accessthe-true-cost-of-science-publishing-1.12676; (2015), http://news.whu.edu.cn/info/1002/43355.htm; Xu, N., Cheng, L., (2015) Acta Editologica, 27 (3), pp. 283-284","Lin, S.; State Key Laboratory of Geomechanics and Geotechnical Engineering, Institute of Rock and Soil Mechanics, Chinese Academy of SciencesChina; email: sqlin@whrsm.ac.cn",,,Association of Learned and Professional Society Publ.,,,,,9531513,,,,English,Learn.

This phase of the research focuses on generation of ideas through interviews and focus groups with 15 participants involved in producing small scholar-led journals that either are or would like to become open access. Although a couple of journals reported that they could survive in an open access future based on existing resources, most were concerned about survival and none expressed confidence that they could thrive in an open access future. These journals are far more diverse than one might imagine. Comparing the costs of article production from one journal with another might not make sense.

Institutional support is the preferred source of financing. The review process requires less than 2 months, and the main problems are low quality of texts and finding reviewers. Functionalities such as mobile versions of the journals, social media, data policy, and altmetrics have yet to be exploited; interdisciplinarity will increase the presence of these functionalities in journals, especially through the influence of the related areas of Communication, Management, and Computer Science.

The authors’ country of affiliation in journals’ papers and references of multinational and national publishers were analysed. The results showed that journals’ papers and references have become more globalized over time. On average, older journals are more international than the newer ones. Although multinational publishers publish more international journals than the national ones do, journals from national publishers have internationalized faster than those from multinationals. The difference between these two groups of publishers is much greater in authoring compared to referencing. For both groups of publishers, the most changes in journal internationality occurred between the fourth and sixth year of indexing in Web of Science. Journals and papers in Humanities journals have the highest rate of increase of internationality although Natural Sciences and Engineering and Technology have the most international papers. Agricultural Sciences has the least international papers; however, these papers cite a wider range of countries’ papers compared to other fields. Journals in Medical and Health Sciences, Natural Sciences, and Agricultural Sciences have the most international references. © 2016 The Author(s).",,,,,,,,,,,"Abt, H.A., Trends toward internationalization in astronomical literature (1990) Publications of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific, 102 (649), pp. 368-372; Bigdeli, Z., Kokabi, M., Rajabi, G.R., Gazni, A., Patterns of authors’ information scattering: Towards a causal explanation of information scattering from a scholarly information-seeking behavior perspective (2013) Scientometrics, 96 (1), pp. 103-131; Buela-Casal, G., Perakakis, P., Taylor, M., Checa, P., Measuring internationality: Reflections and perspectives on academic journals (2006) Scientometrics, 67 (1), pp. 45-65; Danell, R., Engwall, L., (2001) Hello Dolly! the European Cloning of US Management Research, , Umeå, Sweden: Umeå University; Didegah, F., Gazni, A., The extent of concentration in journal publishing (2011) Learned Publishing, 24 (4), pp. 303-310; Frandsen, T.F., Geographical concentration: The case of economics journals (2005) Scientometrics, 63 (1), pp. 69-83; Gazni, A., Globalization of national journals: Investigating the growth of international authorship (2015) Learned Publishing, 28 (3), pp. 195-204; Gazni, A., Sugimoto, C.R., Didegah, F., Mapping world scientific collaboration: Authors, institutions, and countries (2012) Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology, 63 (2), pp. 323-335; Gutiérrez, J., López-Nieva, P., Are international journals of human geography really international?

While a great deal is known about the companies active in this sector, we need to know more about the employees of the firms that edit, produce, market, and distribute today’s scholarly books and journals. To achieve this goal, the researchers conducted an international survey in late 2014 and early 2015 of approximately 6,121 scholarly publishing employees in 33 nations. The researchers received 828 usable questionnaires. Some of the substantive findings about the respondents include: 90.79% identified themselves as white; 85.07% worked in scholarly publishing for more than 5 years; 60% held graduate or professional degrees; and 49% worked in editorial departments.

I studied inaccuracies in references and in-text citations in sample of 97 of the 519 peer-reviewed journals accredited by the Iranian National Commission for Journal Accreditation Policy (Ministry of Research, Science and Technology). The target journals published 2,980 articles with 74,577 cited references and 108,151 in-text citations. The results showed 36.6% as the average percentage error rate (range 5.6% to 61.3%). The mean number of errors in cited reference and in-text citations was 2.7 per article, and the mean number of errors per journal was 690. For the entire sample of articles, 4,369 in-text citations did not match any source in the list of references (4%), and 8,683 cited references did not match any in-text citation (11.6%).

The purpose of this study is to determine if members of a journal editorial board can consistently and reliably use a single numeric scoring system to evaluate the quality of peer reviews. A retrospective analysis of 11 randomly selected manuscripts that had undergone external peer review by three reviewers was performed. Six had been rejected and five accepted. Each deputy editor was asked to score each of the reviews. The intraclass correlation was determined for each of the manuscripts to determine the consistency in grading. The intraclass correlation for 10 of the 11 manuscripts was above 0.87.

Wefound that elite journals with very low acceptance rates have far fewer articles with no or few citations, but that the long tail of articles with two citations or less was actually bigger in a sample of selective traditional journals in comparison with megajournals.

The survey received 2,982 usable responses (a response rate of 1.7%). Respondents from all markets indicated similar levels of review activity. However, analysis of reviewer and corresponding author data suggests that US researchers in fact bear a disproportionate burden of review, while Chinese authors publish twice as much as they review. Results show that while reviewers choose to review in order to give back to the community, there is more perceived benefit in interacting with the community of a top-ranking journal than a low-ranking one. The majority of peer review training received by respondents has come either in the form of journal guidelines or informally as advice from supervisors or colleagues. Seventy-seven per cent show an interest in receiving further reviewer training. Reviewers strongly believe that reviewing is inadequately acknowledged at present and should carry more weight in their institutions’ evaluation process. Respondents value recognition initiatives related to receiving feedback from the journal over monetary rewards and payment in kind. Questions raised include how to evenly expand the reviewer pool, provide training throughout the researcher career arc, and deliver consistent evaluation and recognition for reviewers. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",,,,,,,,,,,"Black, N., Van Rooyen, S., Godlee, F., Smith, R., Evans, S., Whatmakes a good reviewer and a good review for a general medical journal?

Although very different in size and stages of development, all but one were launched first and foremost as open access presses, based in or supported by their university’s library. Why should there have been such a significant flurry of activity in such a short space of time, and what can the stated objectives and activities of these presses tell us about the current UK scholarly publishing environment? To answer some of those questions, this article looks back to the original mission of the founding university presses, examines the policy and funding environments in which the new presses are operating, looks at overseas developments in recent years for comparison, and concludes with a review of the challenges these young presses face as well as the benefits all university presses, but particularly open access ones, can confer to their institutions. ï¿½ 2016 The Author(s).",,,,,,,,,,,"Adema, J., (2010) Overview of Open Access Models for E-Books in the Sciences and the Humanities, , http://www.aupress.ca/documents/OpenAccessModels_OAPEN.pdf; Adema, J., (2015) The Monograph Crisis Revisited [Web Log Post], , https://openreflections.wordpress.com/2015/01/29/the-monograph-crisis-revisited/, January 29; (2016) The Value of University Presses, , http://www.aaupnet.org/about-aaup/about-university-presses/the-value-of-university-presses; (2015) Survey on Publishing Activities – Results, , http://www.aeup.eu/aeup/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/AEUP_survey_results_October_20151.pdf; (2016) About ANU Press, , http://press.anu.edu.au/about/about-anu-press; Bargheer, M., (2016) European University Presses: Some Perspectives from the Mainland.

Research showed few signs of new forms of scholarly usage behaviour taking hold, despite multiple opportunities afforded by Science 2.0 developments. Thus, for determining trustworthiness for usage purposes, the most important activity was reading the abstract. In terms of citations, citing the seminal source was the most common activity. In contrast, citing non-peer reviewed sources, such as the social media, was not thought acceptable. For publishing, relevance to the field was the most important factor when choosing a place to publish. Comparisons were made with a study of 3650 international researchers, which employed the same methods and questions. Themain differences between Chinese and international researchers were that the former (a) rated abstracts more highly, (b) took into account impact factors more when citing and publishing and (c) were much more likely to be influenced by institutional directives when placing their articles. © 2016 The Author(s).",,,,,,,"Alfred P.

Drawing on work completed as part of a Universities UK project to monitor the transition to open access in the United Kingdom, it considers the risks that increased market consolidation and a shift to open access publishing present for societies’ financial sustainability in the coming years. The project identified 279 UK societies that publish peer-reviewed publications. It is estimated that publishing accounts for just over £300 million, or 26%, of these societies’ overall revenues of £1.2 billion, but an in-depth analysis of 30 societies found that the proportion is as high as 80% in some cases. Publishing is typically a profitable activity for societies, and thereby supports their charitable activities and makes an important contribution to their overall financial sustainability. Although most societies are presently in good financial health, the combined pressures of market consolidation and open access, coupled with early indications of an increase in the costs of publishing, suggests that their reliance on publishing could prove an uncertain foundation in the years to come. © Rob Johnson and Mattia Fosci 2015.",,,,,,,,,,,"Morris, S., (2005) The True Costs of Scholarly Journal Publishing, 18, pp. 115-126. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1087/0953151053584975, Learned Publishing; Baldwin, C., (2014) What Do Societies Do with Their Publishing Surpluses?, , http://www.alpsp.org/Ebusiness/ProductCatalog/nfpSurpluses.aspx?ID=48, ALPSP and Blackwell Survey.

It specifi cally looks at the role that ‘emerging’ reputational mechanisms and platforms are playing in building, maintaining, and showcasing scholarly reputation in the digital age. Popular examples of such platforms are ResearchGate and Academia.edu. Data were obtained through one-to-one interviews and focus groups, supported by desk research. The main fi ndings were: (a) it is early days and uptake is light and patchy with platforms largely used for non-reputational purposes, such as sharing documents; (b) most users were passive and did not fully engage with the social aspects of the platforms; (c) the reputational focus was very much on just one scholarly activity (research), on just two outputs of that activity (publications and conferences) and one measurement of that activity (citations), but there are the stirrings of change; (d) young researchers are set to profi t most from the emerging platforms. © David Nicholas, Eti Herman, Hamid Jamali, Blanca Rodríguez-Bravo, Cherifa Boukacem-Zeghmouri, Tom Dobrowolski, and Stephanie Pouchot 2015.",,,,,,,,,,,"Bourdieu, P., Le champ scientifique (1994) Actes De La Recherche En Sciences Sociales, 101-102, pp. 88-104; Nicholas, D., Watkinson, A., Jamali, H.R., Herman, E., Tenopir, C., Volentine, R., Allard, S., Levine, K., (2015) Peer Review: Still King in the Digital Age, 28 (1), pp. 15-21. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1087/20150104, Learned Publishing; Boyer, E.L., Scholarship Reconsidered: Priorities of the Professoriate.

The issues of authorship, duplicate submission, privacy and confidentiality, and integrity of the data were mentioned in more than 50% of the journals. Except for the issues of authorship and protection of animals in research, significant differences were found between Chinese Medical Association Publishing House (CMAPH) journals (n = 67) and non-CMAPH journals (n = 162) (P < 0.05). 66 of the 229 journals did not update their instructions for authors regularly. 196 journal instructions listed authorship criteria, while the other 33 did not. Clinical trial registration policy was required by 26 (11.3%) journals, among which the CONSORT statement for randomized trials was required by 23, and only one journal guided the authors to work in line with the EQUATOR Network. The study concludes that the situation of publishing ethics in the instructions for authors of Chinese biomedical journals is not favorable, and that Chinese biomedical editors should learn more about publishing ethics in order to reduce opportunities for publication problems. © Yang Wu and Qiang Zou 2015.",,,,,,,,,,,"Zhang, Y., Chinese journal finds 31% of submissions plagiarized (2010) Nature, 467 (7312), p. 153. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/467153d; Wager, E., Ethical publishing: The innocent author’s guide to avoiding misconduct (2007) Menopause International, 13 (3), pp. 98-102. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1258/175404507781605604; Lu, J., Technical and ethical standards in China: Long on framework but short on action (2013) Learned Publishing, 26 (4), pp. 257-258. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1087/20130404; Atlas, M.C., Emerging ethical issues in instructions to authors of high-impact biomedical journals (2003) Journal of the Medical Library Association, 91 (4), pp. 442-449. , http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC209510/; Shantikumar, S., Wigley, J., Hameed, W., Handa, A., A survey of instructions to authors in surgical journals on reporting by CONSORT and PRISMA (2012) Annals of the Royal College of Surgeons of England, 94, pp. 468-471. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1308/003588412X13373405386619; Schriger, D.L., Wears, R.L., Cooper, R.J., Callaham, M.L., Upgrading our instructions for authors (2003) Annals of Emergency Medicine, 41, pp. 565-567. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1067/mem.2003.134; Rosenberg, J., Bauchner, H., Backus, J., De Leeuw, P., Drazen, J., Frizelle, F., Godlee, F., Zhaori, G., The new ICMJE recommendations (2014) Indian Journal of Medical Microbiology, 32 (3), pp. 219-220. , http://dx.doi.org/10.4103/0255-0857.136545; Wager, E., Fiack, S., Graf, C., Robinson, A., Rowlands, I., Science journal editors’ views on publication ethics: Results of an international survey (2009) Journal of Medical Ethics, 35 (6), pp. 348-353. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/jme.2008.028324; Bosch, X., Hernández, C., Pericas, J.M., Doti, P., Marušić, A., Misconduct policies in high-impact biomedical journals (2012) Plos One, 7 (12), pp. e51928. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0051928; Bosch, X., Pericas, J.M., Hernández, C., Doti, P., Financial, nonfinancial and editors’ conflicts of interest in high-impact biomedical journals (2013) European Journal of Clinical Investigation, 43 (7), pp. 660-667. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/eci.12090; Bosch, X., Hernández, C., Pericas, J.M., Doti, P., Ghostwriting policies in high-impact biomedical journals: A cross-sectional study (2013) JAMA Internal Medicine, 173 (10), pp. 920-921. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1001/jamainternmed.2013.339; Bosch, X., Pericas, J.M., Hernández, C., Torrents, A., A comparison of authorship policies at top-ranked peer-reviewed biomedical journals (2012) Archives of Internal Medicine, 172 (1), pp. 70-72. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1001/archinternmed.2011.600; Ren, S., Editing scientific journals in mainland China (2005) European Science Editing, 31 (1), pp. 8-10. , http://image.sciencenet.cn/olddata/kexue.com.cn/blog/admin//images/upfiles/2008520132313819785.pdf; Wang, M., Zhou, Z., Fang, H., Liu, X., The bibliometric characteristics of Chinese medical core journals (2011) Serials Review, 37 (1), pp. 9-13. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.serrev.2010.11.002; (2015) Last Updated 15 September 2014, , http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Library_Classification, Chinese Library Classification, accessed 10 March; (2015) The Recommendations for the Conduct, Reporting, Editing, and Publication of Scholarly Work in Medical Journals, , http://www.icmje.org/icmjerecommendations.pdf, International Committee of Medical Journal Editors, Last updated December 2014, accessed 10 March; Committee on Publication Ethics.

Much of the work done to date provides merely a ‘snapshot’ of the current demographics of the publishing workforce at particular moment, and tends not to offer insight into pathways, trajectories, or momentum. This preliminary survey, involving around 150 scholarly publishers, reveals insights into job titles, progressions, and transitions, and exposes some of the reasons for transitions between academia and publishing. The analysis suggests that these transitions and career paths can be systematically studied and documented, for use both by individuals considering their own careers, and by planners and managers in academic institutions and scholarly publishing organizations. © Mark Carden 2015.",,,,,,,,,,,"Publishers Weekly 2013.

The patterns of foreign and interregional authorship in papers and references of 4,199 journals from 3,529 publishers were analyzed. The results revealed that foreign authorship increased from 36% to 62% during the period, but interregional authorship only grew from 77% to 82%. The growth in internationality is not the same across disciplines and regions of the world. Agricultural sciences, psychiatry/psychology, and economics and business have the least number of foreign authors, while journals in space science, mathematics, and physics have the most. According to the number of both foreign-authored papers and foreign-authored citations, clinical medicine is one of the least international fields. Latin America and Middle East publishers have a greater tendency to publish papers from authors in their countries. In contrast, national publishers in North America have become considerably more international over time.

It discusses available market resources, reports, and market research undertaken by other publishing companies and consultants, before going on to look at some of the existing internal sources that commissioning editors can draw on. It considers both qualitative and quantitative ways of testing and developing a commissioning editor’s understanding of end-users to improve market reach and customer satisfaction. The article concludes with a case study illustrating how one publisher used research on endusers to improve its products and be more successful in the market. © Francis Dodds 2015.",,,,,,,,,,,"Dodds, F., Changes in the role of the commissioning editor in academic book publishing (2015) Learned Publishing, 28 (1), pp. 35-42. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1087/20150106; Sandusky, B., (2011) Portraits of an Industry in Flux: Digital Publishing and UX, , UX Magazine, article no. 61; Jones, P., (2014) Should Innovative Ideas in Scholarly Publishing Be Driven by Academics Themselves?, , www.istme.org/resource/resmqs/EON…/Academic, Editorial Office News, the official newsletter of the International Society of Managing and Technical Editors (ISTME), October; Van Baren, J., Relating content to the user (2012) Academic and Professional Publishing, , http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/B978-1-84334-669-2.50011-1, R.

To partially fill this gap, we compare Flemish editors and other researchers, in terms of career stage, productivity, publication types, publications with domestic and international collaboration as well as the number of (international or all) unique co-authors, co-editors and associated book chapter authors. The results show that editors are mostly established researchers, especially in the social sciences, produce more book chapters and monographs than do other researchers, and are more productive. Nevertheless, editors collaborate less than do other researchers, both in terms of publications and in number of co-authors. Including book chapter authors in the editors’ collaboration networks makes those networks substantially larger, demonstrating that editors do not mainly call upon authors from their existing collaboration network when choosing book chapter authors in the edited books. Finally, editors seem to co-author with their book chapter authors slightly more often after the publication of the edited book than before. © Truyken L.B.

The editors of more than half of the journals published in the Czech Republic participated in the first part of the study. An extensive questionnaire survey that addressed about 600 editorial boards of specialized journals was performed. We found the majority of journals to be published by smaller and non-traditional publishers. One of the most remarkable results was the finding that if we focus on economic models and peer-review models, open access journals do not differ considerably from other journals. Rather than according to the mode of access, much more significant differences may be observed between different types of publishers and between individual fields. It seems that on a local level the expectations associated with open access have not been fulfilled and the difference between subscriptionbased journals and open access journals is not so sharp. © Ladislava Zbiejczuk Suchá and Jela Steinerová 2015.",,,,,,,,,,,"Borgman, C.L., (2007) Scholarship in the Digital Age: Information, Infrastructure, and the Internet, , MIT Press, Cambridge, MA; Crow, R., (2009) Income Models for Open Access: An Overview of Current Practice, , Scholarly Publishing & Academic Resources Coalition, Washington, DC; Withey, L., (2011) Sustaining Scholarly Publishing: New Business Models for University Presses, , http://www.h2mw.eu/redactionmedicale/2011/03/aaupbusinessmodels2011%5B1%5D.pdf, The Association of American University Presses; Pöschl, U., Interactive open access publishing and public peer review: The effectiveness of transparency and self-regulation in scientific quality assurance (2010) IFLA Journal, 36 (1), pp. 40-46. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0340035209359573; Ford, E., Defining and characterizing open peer review: A review of the literature (2013) Journal of Scholarly Publishing, 44, p. 4. , http://dx.doi.org/10.3138/jsp.44-4-001; Whitworth, B., Friedman, R., Reinventing academic publishing online.

Beyond anecdotal evidence, however, there are no published accounts of the experiences of editors and authors of bilingual journals with the process of bilingual publication. It is also unclear how authors writing in bilingual journals judge the quality of the translations and whether they consider this sort of publishing as beneficial for their aims. Consequently, we carried out two surveys: one among editors of bilingual journals and one anonymous survey among authors and translators of articles published in Deutsches Ärzteblatt International, the bilingual journal of the German Medical Association. Eight of nine journals as well as 233 of 353 authors and 4 of 6 translators took part. Most journals reported that bilingual publication helped in becoming indexed in important databases (e.g. Medline), receiving or improving an Impact Factor, and in attracting authors. All journals plan to continue publishing bilingually. Authors were ‘satisfied’ (40.8%) or ‘very satisfied’ (57.8%) with translations. Almost all (96.7%) were in favour of bilingual publication of their work. They did not view an English translation as an obstacle to another related English language paper. Translators highlighted challenges relating to specialized terminology and to terms specific to the regional healthcare system. © Elke Bartholomäus, Sandy Goldbeck-Wood, Meike Sewering, and Christopher Baethge 2015.",,,,,,,,,,,"Baethge, C., The languages of medicine (2008) Deutsches Ärzteblatt International, 105, pp. 37-40. , http://dx.doi.org/10.3238/arztebl.2008.0037; Lippert, H., Rückzug der deutschen Sprache aus der Medizin?

In Malaysia, as in many other nations, publication in ISI-ranked journals is a crucial factor. This focus is causing a strain on national journals that suffer from a lack of content, institutional support, and national recognition. This paper presents data about Malaysian journal publishing and the study questioned editors in chief of Malaysian journals to obtain opinions of the problems they encounter and possible solutions. Data were collected through interviews. The participants in the study highlighted four main issues that resulted in a weak publishing environment: institutional reputation building (academic reputation), researcher prestige/image building, lack of focus on local journal issues by legislators, and a weak publishing culture. The article concludes that the Malaysian Ministry of Higher Education should pay attention to national initiatives in countries such as India and Australia that recognize national journals and reward researchers for publishing in them. © Nahid Bayat Bodaghi, S.A.

This process is difficult without a standardized way of recording data, so Jisc Collections has developed a standard data collection template and is helping institutions to release data openly.

The responsibility for funding open access is more likely to fall on the author or a granting organization than the library or institution. 23% of libraries in this survey help fi nance open access, and one-third of these had established criteria for funding.

Data about the journals and the authors of their articles were collected from the websites of the publishers, Google Scholar and Web of Science. As at December 2012, the journals had together produced a total of 5,601 papers written by 5,599 authors, and received 12,596 citations. Authors from Asia accounted for 56.79% of the publications; those from Africa wrote 28.35% while Europe contributed 7.78%. Authors from Africa accounted for 18.25% of the citations these journals received, and this is about one-third the number of citations by authors in Asia (54.62%). At country level, India ranks first in the top 10 citer countries, while Nigeria, the host country of the journals, ranked eighth.

A 2010 IMLS-funded survey found that 55% of respondents – from US academic libraries of all different types and sizes – were already implementing or developing a publishing program. Library-led publishing has garnered such momentum because, by offering low- or no-cost publishing to university scholars, it addresses needs that traditional publishing has not been able to meet. This article presents a series of small case studies to illustrate different journals that have benefited from the library-publishing model: (i) a journal that struggled to find an affordable publisher in its emerging field; (ii) a small society journal that could no longer afford to support itself in print; (iii) society publications that go beyond the traditional journal format; and (iv) a student journal with a revolving editorial board. © Casey Busher and Irene Kamotsky 2015.",,,,,,,,,,,"Mullins, J., Murray-Rust, C., Ogburn, O., Crow, R., Ivins, O., Mower, A., Newton, M., Watkinson, C., (2011) Library Publishing Services: Strategies for Success Research Report Version 1.0.

It is found that 72% do charge article publication fees (APCs), which is a higher percentage than found in DOAJ journals. The mean number of articles published during 2013 was 227, but ranged from 4 to 2,286 articles. The majority of journals charge low APCs and can be assumed to have modest annual incomes. There was no correlation between the amount of APC charged and the number of articles published. Comparing the number of journals charging APCs compared to the percentage from DOAJ, the findings suggest a connection between predatory practices and charging author fees. However, a comprehensive assessment of the dynamics of open access journal publishing beyond author charges should be done to avoid using APCs alone as a measure of whether a journal is predatory or not. © Jingfeng Xia 2015.",,,,,,,,,,,"Beall, J., Predatory open-access scholarly publishers (2010) The Charleston Advisor, 11 (4), pp. 10-17; Beall, J., Update: Predatory open-access scholarly publishers (2010) The Charleston Advisor, 12 (1), p. 50. , http://dx.doi.org/10.5260/chara.12.1.50; Beall, J., (2012) Criteria for Determining Open-Access Predatory Publishers, July. , scholarlyoa.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/criteria-2012-2.pdfaccessed 17; Beall, J., Predatory publishers are corrupting open access (2012) Nature, 498, p. 179. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/489179a; Beall, J., Predatory publishing (2012) Scientist, , http://www.the-scientist.com/?articles.view/articleNo/32426/title/Predatory-Publishing/, (Philadelphia, Pa), August, accessed 17 July 2014; Beall, J., The open-access movement is not really about open access (2013) Triple C, 11 (2), pp. 589-597; Bohannon, J., Who’s afraid of peer review?

Nevertheless, critique of the shortcomings of current practices (bias, slowness, etc.) have led to many publishers and journals experimenting with novel ways of performing and organizing peer review, enabled by e-publishing and new revenue models. This article proposes a taxonomy of such innovations and discusses a number of cases where, for instance, the assignment of reviewers is handled differently from current best practice. New models, which seem particularly attractive to manuscript authors, are acceptance of any scientifically valid articles as practiced in ‘megajournals’. and increased transparency about how the peer-review process in a particular journal works. © Bo-Christer Björk and Turid Hedlund 2015.",,,,,,,,,,,"(2013) Summary Report of Journal Operations, , http://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/features/2013-statistics.pdf, American Psychological Association (accessed 19 February 2015); Beall, J., Predatory publishing is just one of the consequences of gold open access (2013) Learned Publishing, 26, pp. 79-84. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1087/20130203; Binfield, P., (2013) Open Access Megajournals-Have they Changed Everything?, , http://oaweek.open.ubc.ca/2013/09/03/open-accessmegajournals/, Keynote lecture, Open UBC Week, University of British Columbia, 22 October 2013; Björk, B.-C., Solomon, D., The publishing delay in scholarly peer-reviewed journals (2013) Journal of Informetrics, 7, pp. 914-923. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.joi.2013.09.001; Bohannon, J., Who’s afraid of peer review (2013) Science Magazine, 342 (6154), pp. 60-65. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.342.6154.60; Bornmann, L., Scientific peer review (2011) Annual Review of Information Science and Technology, 45 (1), pp. 197-245. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/aris.2011.1440450112; Clarke, M., Game of Papers: ELife, BMC (2013) Plos and EMBO Announce New Peer Review Consortium, , http://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2013/07/15/game-ofpapers-elife-bmc-plos-and-embo-announce-new-peerreview-consortium/, The Scholarly Kitchen blog, 15 July 2013; Grainger, D., Peer review as professional responsibility: A quality control system only as good as the participants (2007) Biomaterials, 28, pp. 5199-5203. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biomaterials.2007.07.004; Kronick, D., Peer review in the 18th century scientific journalism (1990) Journal of the American Medical Association, 263, pp. 1321-1322. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1001/jama.1990.03440100021002; Lee, C., Sugimoto, C., Zhang, G., Cronin, B., Bias in peer review (2013) Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology, 64, pp. 2-17. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/asi.22784; Nicholas, D., Watkinson, A., Jamali, H.R., Herman, E., Tenopir, C., Volentine, R., Allard, S., Levine, K., (2015) Peer Review: Still King in the Digital Age, 28, pp. 15-21. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1087/20150104, Learned Publishing; Peters, P., The ISRN Series from Hindawi (2011) Conference Presentation, , https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBs0hfh232M, COASP conference, Tallinn, Estonia; Solomon, D., A survey of authors publishing in four megajournals (2014) Peerj, , http://dx.doi.org/10.7717/peerj.365; Spier, R., The history of peer-review process (2002) Trends in Biotechnology, 20, pp. 357-358. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0167-7799(02)01985-6; Souder, L., The ethics of scholarly peer review: A review of the literature (2011) Learned Publishing, 24, pp. 55-72; Sugimoto, C., Larivière, V., Ni, C., Cronin, B., Journal acceptance rates: A cross-disciplinary analysis of variability and relationships with journal measures (2013) Journal of Informetrics, 7, pp. 897-906. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.joi.2013.08.007",,,,Association of Learned and Professional Society Publ.,,,,,9531513,,,,English,Learn.

The study shows that peer review is still the most trustworthy characteristic of all. There is, though, a common perception that open access journals are not peer reviewed or do not have proper peer-review systems. Researchers appear to have moved inexorably from a print-based system to a digital system, but it has not significantly changed the way they decide what to trust. They do not trust social media. Only a minority – although significantly mostly young and early career researchers – thought that social media are anything other than more appropriate to personal interactions and peripheral to their professional/academic lives. There are other significant differences, according to the age of the researcher. Thus, in regard to choosing an outlet for publication of their work, young researchers are much less concerned with the fact that it is peer reviewed. © David Nicholas, Anthony Watkinson, Hamid R.

This paper examines some of the challenges that have been triggered by the OA movement, particularly at the Africa regional level. Basically, OA is technology heavy and its economic arrangements benefit mainly the developed world. There is evidence of OA initiatives in Africa, but these initiatives are mainly individually based, defragmented, and largely underdeveloped, and sometimes predatory. This author argues that policy-makers in Africa need to embrace OA and establish useful policies – for regional journals and regional repositories and for academic reward, and support this with technical investment to enable quality online publishing. © Bo-Christer Björk and Turid Hedlund 2015.",,,,,,,,,,,"Adomi, E., Mordi, C., (2003) Publication in Foreign Journals and Promotion of Academics in Nigeria, 16 (4), pp. 12-26. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1087/095315103322421991, Learned Publishing; Aronson, B., Improving online access to medical information for low-income countries (2004) New England Journal of Medicine, 350, pp. 966-968. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1056/NEJMp048009; Arunachalam, S., Information for research in developing countries-information technology, a friend or foe?

These papers were divided into six groups according to the difference in publication month, and we analyzed citations to these papers for the 9 years after publication. The results showed that within 5 years after papers from physical geography were published, the overall differences in citations of papers in different groups were statistically significant (P < 0.05); after that, the differences were not statistically significant. Within 5 years after papers from diabetes (endocrine and metabolism) were published, the overall differences in citations of papers in different groups were statistically significant (P < 0.05); thereafter, the differences were not statistically significant. Within 7 years after papers from the Journal of Biological Chemistry were published, the overall differences in citations of papers in different groups were statistically significant (P < 0.05); thereafter, the differences were not statistically significant. Citations of papers followed the same pattern irrespective of discipline, subject or journal: citations of papers published in the same year but different month were obviously different in the first few publishing years, but as time went on, only the difference in publication month in a calendar year did not affect the papers’ longer-term citation. © Gai Shuang-Shuang, Liu Xue-Li, Zhang Shi-Le, and Liu Rui-Yuan 2015.",,,,,,,,,,,"Yan-Hou, C., Hua, Y., On the adaptability, limitation and irrationality of appraisal by frequency of quotation (2009) Journal of Chongqing University, 15 (5), pp. 59-62. , (Social Science Edition); Tort, A., Targino, Z.H., Amaral, O.B., Rising publication delays inflate journal impact factors (2012) Plos One, 7 (12), pp. 1-6. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.00533743; Huang, M.H., Lin, W., The influence of journal self-citations on journal impact factor and immediacy index (2012) Online Information Review, 36 (5), pp. 639-654. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/14684521211275957; Wang, J., Citation time window choice for research impact evaluation (2013) Scientometrics, 94 (3), pp. 851-872. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11192-012-0775-9; Xue-Li, L., Shuang-Shuang, G., Shi-Le, Z., Comparative studies on journal impact factors with different citation time windows (2014) Chinese Journal of Scientific and Technical Periodicals, 25 (12), pp. 1509-1512; Adams, J., Early citation counts correlate with accumulated impact (2005) Scientometrics, 63 (3), pp. 567-581. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11192-005-0228-9; Wang, Y.-C., Hu, M., Empirical research of journal’ citation distribution law: A case study of economic journals (2011) Library and Information Service Online, 12, pp. 28-38; Cheng, X.-J., Yang, J.-J., Meaning and feasibility of the new journal evaluation indicator of Scopus: SNIP (2012) Library and Information Service, 56 (10), pp. 6-10; Hu, Y., Wang, H.-W., Guan, R., An evaluation and comparative analysis on scientific papers based on ESI: Taking Beijing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics as an example (2013) Journal of Beijing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, 26 (2), pp. 116-120. , (Social Sciences Edition); Zhang, Y.-X., Analysis’s paper by cited of (2011) Journal of Beijing Polytechnic College.

The survey asked about lifestyle and work, and in particular how these are changing with the growth of self-publishing authors. This article reports on the changing opportunities for editorial work and the practices of independent editors, and how their working routines have changed over the past three years. It reveals a shift from working for traditional publishers towards working for new clients, including self-publishing authors; relationships with traditional publishers are strained for a variety of reasons, and increasing satisfaction levels are discernible in relationships with experienced self-publishers. The paper considers the consequences of editors’ changing patterns of work and client base, and likely future outcomes.

This article examines usage data at the University of Huddersfield to show how resource discovery has helped to increase the usage of publisher content that has been made available to discovery vendors, and considers the implications for publishers who are yet to do this. The article concludes that resource discovery systems have effectively levelled the playing field, allowing small to medium-sized publishers to make content discoverable to users, and encourages publishers who do not have their content indexed in resource discovery systems to speak to discovery service vendors in order to do so at the earliest opportunity. © Bo-Christer Björk and Turid Hedlund 2015.",,,,,,,,,,,"Hawkins, K., Stone, G., Pesch, O., Sedgwick, M., Cracking the Discovery Code (2014) Presentation at ALPSP International Conference 2014, , http://eprints.hud.ac.uk/21270/, 10–12 September(accessed 29 December 2014); Stone, G., Searching life, the universe and everything?

Our proposal suggests all tertiary institutions contribute to systemic support of the research process itself, including its entire scholarly output. A bold rethinking of the economics of OA by way of partnerships among scholarly societies and academic libraries funded by an institutional fee structure based on a student-and-faculty per-capita sliding scale, our plan is nevertheless intentionally incremental. Our proposal focuses first on HSS and primarily in the United States, but just as research and scholarship are increasingly global and collaborative, our plan is not bound by discipline or national borders, but can be adopted by all those looking for a more equitable and sustainable OA model. © 2014, Rebecca Kennison and Lisa Norberg.",,,,,,,,,,,"Kennison, R., Norberg, L., (2014) A scalable and sustainable approach to open access publishing and archiving for humanities and social sciences, , http://bit.ly/llLMIPx, New York, KIN Consultants, (accessed 30 May 2014); http://bit.ly/ljo9YaO, note; Fitzpatrick, K., (2013) Statement on public access to federally funded research, , http://scholcomm.commons.mla.org/stare-ment-on-public-access-to-federally-funded-research, New York, Modern Language Association, (accessed 29 September 2013); Housewright, R., Schonfeld, R.C., Wulfson, K., US Fuculty Survey 2012, , New York; Ithaka, S.R., (2013), http://sr.ithaka.org/research-publications/ithaka-sr-jisc-rluk-uk-survey-academics-2012, (accessed 28 November 2013); Tillery, K., (2012) Study of Subscription Prices for Scholarly Society Journals: Society Journal Pricing Trends and Industry Overview, , http://allen-press.com/resources/education/jps, Lawrence, KS, Allen Press, 2012, (accessed 3 October 2013); Crow, R., Publishing cooperatives: an alternative for society publishers (2006) First Monday,, 11 (9). , http://first-monday.org/issues/issuell_9/crow/index.html, accessed 19 February 2013",,,,Association of Learned and Professional Society Publ.,,,,,9531513,,,,English,Learn.

Three issues were examined. First, how do advertising academics assess the peer-review process in advertising journals on the following dimensions: fairness, anonymity (truly double-blind), timeliness, and effectiveness in improving the quality of research? Second, how do they perceive the ethicality of review process behaviors? Third, what steps do they suggest for improving the quality or integrity of the peer-review process? Data was collected through a survey of US-based advertising academics. The findings reveal that advertising academics believe that, for the most part, advertising journals are succeeding at fairness, protecting anonymity, improving the research of submitters, and avoiding ethical infractions in the review process. However, advertising academics would like to see improvements in timeliness as well as in incentives and guidelines provided to participants in the peer-review process. © Owen Kulemeka 2014.",,,,,,,,,,,"Beard, F., Peer evaluation and readership of influential contributions to the advertising literature (2002) Journal of Advertising, 31, pp. 65-75. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00913367.2002.10673686; Barry, T., Publication productivity in the three leading US advertising journals: Inaugural issues through 1988 (1989) Journal of Advertising, 19, pp. 52-60. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00913367.1990.10673180; Zinkhan, G., International advertising: A research agenda.

The 2-year, 3-year, 5-year, 8-year, and 10-year cited rates of these papers were calculated to analyze statistically the correlations with impact factor, 5-year impact factor, immediacy index, eigenfactor score, article influence score, and total cites. The results of questionnaires sent to 8,525 ophthalmologists were used to analyse the correlations between the papers cited rates for different years and traditional bibliometric indicators. The results showed that eigenfactor score and total cites were better than other indicators, and impact factor was better than the 5-year impact factor. The 2-year and 3-year cited rates of papers were reasonable for evaluating science journals, and the 2-year cited rate was better than the 3-year cited rate. The 5-year (and more than 5 years) cited rates were not significant in evaluating science journals. © Gai Shuang-Sluiang, Liu Xue Li, Zhany Shi-Le, and Liu Rui-Yuan 2014.",,,,,,,,,,,"Jing-An, P., Yu-Hua, Z., Zheng, M., The comprehensive evaluation index system of Chinese sci-tech periodicals (2000) Chinese Journal of Scientific and Technical Periodicals, 11 (4), pp. 217-219; Yue-Hong, W., Bibliometric indicators and science journal evaluation (2002) Journal of Huainan Institute of Technology (Social Science), 4 (3), pp. 99-101; Li-Ping, S., Jian-Fang, W., Empirical study of journal evaluation indicator.

It uses these findings to consider barriers and opportunities for academic research both specifically in PS and more broadly in other profession-orientated disciplines. Greater understanding was felt to be of value as universities internationally are increasingly being pressurized to create close links with the wider economy, produce employable students‚ and encourage relevant and impletnentable research. The survey suggests that while there is strong agreement among respondents that it is beneficial for those teaching PS to be research-active, there was considerable variation in current levels of research activity. Respondents rated their research activity highest in departments with an active research culture and effective research support processes. Lack of time was the main reason cited for reduced or non-involvement in academic research and while this is a common issue for academics, PS respondents isolated a number of exacerbating factors. Suggestions are offered for addressing identified barriers and pursuing new opportunities for research. The paper argues that as research outputs of academics are increasingly monitored it is important to consider how the full range of disciplines housed within institutions can be accommodated within research support. Overall, the research has a strong relevance for interdisciplinary areas, and other profession- and practice-orientated subjects within universities. © 2014, Alison Baverstock and Jackie Steinitz.",,,,,,,,,,,"www.publishingeducation.org; Society for the History of Authorship, Reading and Publishing, , www.sharpweb.org; note; Association for Journalism Education, , www.ajeuk.org; Hefce is the I ligher Education Funding Council for England","Steinitz, J.; Department of Journalism and Publishing, Kingston University, Penrhyn Road, United Kingdom",,,Association of Learned and Professional Society Publ.,,,,,9531513,,,,English,Learn.

It places lay summaries in the wider contexts of patients’ information-seeking behaviour and OA publishing activities. It reports the results of qualitative research involving two stakeholder groups: employees of organizations with a stake in communicating OA medical research to the public, and members of the public who have experience of accessing online medical research. It shows that patient access to the research literature is seen as one of a number of important sources of information that can help them manage their health conditions as ‘informed patients’. However, accessing the literature was reported to be problematical, particularly because of paywalls, and there were also difficulties in using it, including language barriers. Lay summaries were seen to make a helpful contributum to improving patient access to information. There is, however, a clear need to gather more evidence about the costs and benefits of such an approach and also on the potential ways in which OA can create benefits for the general public. © 2014, Emily Nunn and Stephen Pinfield.",,,,,,,,,,,"Willinsky, J., (2006) The Access Principle: The ('use for Open Access to Research and Scholarship, , Cambridge, MA, MIT Press; Research Councils UK, (2013) RCUK policy on open access and supporting guidance, , http://www.rcuk.ac.uk/documents/documents/RCUKOpenAccessPolicy.pdf, (accessed 1 August 2013); Dingwall, R., Who really, really wants open access?

It is generally assumed that what is not reported are 'negative results'. Our study approaches the issue from a new angle by exploring what researchers perceive to be 'unpublishable'. A survey regarding 'unpublishables' was sent out to 2,535 faculty members at Indiana University. Forty of these individuals consented to in-depth interviews, which more fully explored these academics' views on the issue of unpublishable work. Our results indicate that there are several types of research besides negative results that are perceived to be unpublishable yet worthy of publication. Moreover, there is a great diversity within and across disciplines as to what constitutes 'unpublishable' research. Respondents indicated that academic discourse would benefit from the formal dissemination of papers that included inconclusive or null results, as well as replication and refutation studies. The results of our study suggest that there is a perceived gap in scholarly communication, which is to the detriment of science. These results can be used by administrators, educators, and publishers in order to refine scholarly communication practices so as to create a more robust, accurate literature and to inform future generations of researchers. © Andrew Tsou, Jurta Schickore, and Cassidy R.

It also looks at the implications of these changes for information professionals and publishers who have come to rely on this data to understand the behaviour of clients and customers in the virtual environment. Ubiquitous and expanding, Google Analytics generates statistics about a website’s traffic and traffic sources, albeit from a marketers’ perspective, is evaluated as a possible replacement; something which might plug the user knowledge gap which is worryingly opening up, or maybe even, put us in a better position overall. The paper is built on the knowledge and experience of evaluating server logs for more than a decade, mostly for publishers and libraries, and also on two recent projects where server log analysis was supplemented with Google Analytics. © 2014, D.J.

The guidelines were reviewed for completeness and clarity in addressing ‘aims and scope’, ‘submission and post-submission processes’, ‘formatting instructions’, ‘ethical requirements’, and ‘authorship’, and were subjectively assessed as being complete (score 1) or incomplete (0), and clear (1) or unclear (0). Scores were represented as mean percentages. No journal scored 100% for completeness and clarity. ‘Formatting instructions’ was the most complete and clear category, and ‘authorship’ the least complete and clear category.

One of the pressing challenges in data infrastructure (taken here to include issues relating to hardware, software and content format, as well as human actors) is how best to enable data interoperability across boundaries. This is particularly critical as the world deals with bigger and more complex problems that require data and insights from a range of disciplines. The RDA has been set up to enable more data to be shared across barriers to address these challenges. It does this through focused Working Groups and Interest Groups, formed of experts from around the world, and drawing from the academic, industry, and government sectors. © Andrew Treloar 2014.",,,,,,,,,,,"(2014) Plenary Meetings, , https://rd-alliance.org/plenary-meetings.html, RDA, accessed 17 June; (2014) International Digital Curation Conference (IDCC), , http://www.dcc.ac.uk/events/international-digital-curation-conference-idcc, Digital Curation Centre, accessed 17 June; (2014) EUDAT Conferences, , http://www.eudat.eu/conferences, EUDAT Project, accessed 17 June; Wood, J., Ersson, T., Bachem, A., Riding the Wave: How Europe Can Gain from the Rising Tide of Scientifi c Data (2011) Final Report of the High Level Expert Group on Scientifi C Data, Submission to the European Commission, , http://cordis.europa.eu/fp7/ict/e-infrastructure/docs/hlg-sdi-report.pdf, accessed 17 June 2014; (2014) A Surfboard for Riding the Wave: Towards a Four Country Action Programme on Research Data, , http://www.knowledgeexchange.info/Default.aspx?ID=469, Knowledge Exchange 2011, accessed 17 June; (2014) NSF Data Management Plan Requirements, , http://www.nsf.gov/eng/general/dmp.jsp, National Science Foundation, accessed 17 June; (2014) NIH Data Sharing Policy, , http://grants.nih.gov/grants/policy/data_sharing/, National Institutes of Health, accessed 17 June; (2014) Policy on Data Management and Sharing, , http://www.wellcome.ac.uk/About-us/Policy/Policy-and-position-statements/WTX035043.htm, Wellcome Trust, accessed 17 June; (2014) Guidelines on Data Management in Horizon 2020, , http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/grants_manual/hi/oa_pilot/h2020-hi-oa-data-mgt_en.pdf, European Commission, accessed 17 June; (2014) Combined Faqs for Discovery Program Schemes, , http://www.arc.gov.au/pdf/DP15/Combined%20FAQs%20for%20Discovery%20Program%20Schemes%202014-15_Version%204_28%20Feb%202014.pdf, Australian Research Commission, sections 3.12 and 3.13 , accessed 17 June; (2014), http://www.nature.com/news/specials/datasharing/index.html, Nature, Special issue on data sharing, 9 September 2009, accessed 17 June; (2011) Special Online Collection: Dealing with Data, , http://www.sciencemag.org/site/special/data/, Science Magazine, 11 February, accessed 17 June 2014; Bailey, C., Research Data Curation Bibliography, , http://digital-scholarship.org/rdcb/rdcb.htm, version 4, accessed 17 June; (2014) The Tao of IETF: A Novice’s Guide to the Internet Engineering Task Force, , http://www.ietf.org/tao.html, IETF, accessed 27 June; (2014), http://ands.org.au/, Australian National Data Service (ANDS), accessed 29 June; (2014) Guiding Principles, , https://www.rdalliance.org/get-involved.html, RDA, accessed 27 June; (2014), https://www.rd-alliance.org/group-processprocedures.html, RDA, accessed 27 June; (2014), https://www.rd-alliance.org/group-type/working-group, RDA, accessed 27 June; (2014), https://www.rd-alliance.org/interestgroup-list.html, RDA, accessed 27 June; (2014) Organisation, , https://www.rd-alliance.org/organisation.html, RDA, accessed 27 June; (2014) Plenary Four Collocated Events, , https://rd-alliance.org/plenary-meetings/fourth-plenary/plenary4-colocated-events.html, RDA, accessed 27 June","Treloar, A.; Technology for the Australian National Data Service, Monash UniversityAustralia",,,Association of Learned and Professional Society Publ.,,,,,9531513,,,,English,Learn.

Funding for article processing charges (APCs) is still a strong barrier for many authors, particularly for subscription journals where the hybrid option is expensive and an added extra feature after an article is accepted for publication. Many research funders in Europe have started or are considering mechanisms for paying APCs with earmarked funding in order to increase the uptake of OA. At the same time they are well aware that their actions may influence the way the OA market will develop in the near future. This article discusses a number of scenarios for ways in which funders could cover the cost of APCs, while encouraging the development of a competitive and transparent market for APC-funded OA scholarly publishing. We provide evidence that the current APC-funded full OA market is sensitive to journal prestige/impact. We present a value-based cap funding scheme which could help maintain transparency, bringing hybrid market pricing in line with the full OA market. We also consider a scenario that addresses hybrid 'double dipping' while limiting the cost of transitioning to full OA for research-intensive universities as well as costsharing as a mechanism for providing authors with an incentive for considering cost as well as value in choosing where to publish. © Bo-Christer Björk and David Solomon 2014.",,,,,,,,,,,"Ricci, L., Kreisman, R., (2013) Open access: Market size, share, forecast, and trends, , http://www.outsellinc.com/products/index/1135-open-access-marketsize-share-forecast-and-trends, Outsell; Björk, B., Solomon, D., Developing an Effective market for Open Access Article Processing Charges (2014) Wellcome Trust Report, , http://www.wellcome.ac.uk/About-us/Policy/Spotlight-issues/Open-access/Guides/WTP054773.htm; Solomon, D.J., Björk, B.-C., A study of open access journals using article processing charges (2012) Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology, 63 (8), pp. 1485-1495; Solomon, D.J., Björk, B.-C., Publication fees in open access publishing: Sources of funding and factors influencing choice of journal (2012) Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology, 63 (1), pp. 98-107. , doi: 10.1002/asi.21660; Dallmeier-Tiessen, S., Goerner, B., Darby, R., Hyppoelae, J., Igo-Kemenes, P., Kahn, D., Lambert, S., (2010) Open Access Publishing-Models and Attributes, , Max Planck Digital Library/Informationsversorgung; Björk, B.-C., The hybrid model for open access publication of scholarly articles-a failed experiment?

The project is an element of the 'balanced package' proposed by the Finch Working Group on how to expand access to published research in the UK, which reported its recommendations to the UK government in June 2012. We describe the setting up of the project and the findings from a three-month technical pilot prior to the launch of a two-year national pilot in February 2014. The project has already attracted support from the major scholarly publishers, with about 8,400 journal titles now available. The access platform has been shown to be usable by public librarians and library patrons. We are now addressing the challenge of understanding how the public will make use of the system and exploring how best to provide training and education for librarians and users. © Sarah Faulder and Shinwha Cha 2014.",,,,,,,,,,,"(2012) Accessibility, Sustainability, Excellence: How to Expand Access to Research Publications, , Report of the Working Group on Expanding Access to Published Research Findings, Chaired by Dame Janet Finch, June; Sykes, P., Open access gets tough (2013) Insights, 27 (2), pp. 109-114. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1629/2048-7754.62; Suber, P., (2012) Open Access, , http://mitpress.mit.edu/books/open-access, Cambridge, MA, MIT Press; Willinsky, J., (2009) The Access Principle: The Case for Open Access to Research and Scholarship, , http://mitpress.mit.edu/books/access-principle, Cambridge, MA, MIT Press",,,,Association of Learned and Professional Society Publ.,,,,,9531513,,,,English,Learn.

To qualify for analysis journals had to be peer reviewed and to have published at least one issue in 2012. Some differences from the results of previous studies were noted. More journals are internationally oriented and the number of times they are accessed apparently depends on their scientific field. Publishers are still mostly not-for-profit but are more likely now to apply article processing/publication charges. This is new for Croatia and raises questions about the potential influence of this trend on the availability and visibility of scientific results.

However, owing to barriers in language and culture, it is possible that authors from these countries face unique challenges in getting published. Moreover, as submissions from these countries increase, journal editors may be able to spot some trends in the problems encountered when processing these submissions. This study presents the results of two surveys - one involving non-native English-speaking authors from East Asia and another involving international journal editors. The surveys were designed to throw light on the challenges East Asian authors face in the publication process and the perceptions journal editors have of submissions from East Asian countries. Here, we present and discuss the survey results, highlight gaps in the perspectives of authors and journal editors, and make recommendations to bridge these gaps. © Clarinda Cerejo 2014.",,,,,,,,,,,"(2013) Nature Publishing Index 2012 Global, , http://www.natureasia.com/en/publishing-index/pdf/NPI2012_Global.pdf, Nature Publishing Group, Available at, (accessed 12 September 2013); (2012) Thomson Reuters, , http://scholarone.com/media/pdf/GlobalPublishing_WP.pdf, Global Publishing: Changes in Submission Trends and the Impact on Scholarly Publishers, Available at, (accessed 12 September 2013); Adams, J., Pendlebury, D., Stembridge, B., (2013) Building Bricks: Exploring the Global Research and Innovation Impact of Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Korea, , http://science-watch.com/sites/sw/files/sw-article/media/grr-brick.pdf, Thomson Reuters, (accessed 12 September 2013); Hundley, L., Peterson, S., Kenzer, B., The rise of China and the academy (2012) Annual Meeting of the BISA-ISA Joint International Conference 'Diversity In the Discipline: Tension Or Opportunity In Responding to Global', , http://citation.allacademic.com/meta/p599623_index.html, Paper presented at the, July, accessed 12 September 2013; Altbach, P.A., Wang, Q., (2012) China's Rise In Science May Taper Off, , http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=china-sci-ence-rise-may-taper-off, Scientific American.

However, the extent and effect of these practices are poorly understood. After reviewing prior literature regarding the impact of news coverage on the citation rate of journal articles, this paper seeks to measure the extent to which medical journals with clinical significance use public relations practices to encourage news coverage of their articles, and the success that those practices had in increasing coverage by newspapers. Editors of 120 medical journals published worldwide with clinical relevance were surveyed; the response rate was 54%. Eighty per cent of respondents reported that their journal offered journalists at least one of press releases, access to full-text articles, or press conferences. Editors whose journals used the practices in conjunction with an embargo reported higher-quality news coverage than editors of journals that did not, but editors and journalists held differing views about the justifications for the specific practice known as an embargo. © Vincent Kiernan 2014.",,,,,,,,,,,"Fontanarosa, P.B., Flanagin, A., Deangelis, C.D., The Journal's policy regarding release of information to the public (2000) Journal of the American Medical Association, 284 (22), pp. 2929-2931. , 13; Medical journals and medical reporting (2000) New England Journal of Medicine, 342, pp. 1668-1671. , Steinbrook.

The sample of journals was selected from DOAJ, IndianJournal.com and Open J-Gate. Journal characteristics were measured in terms of growth, subjects, publishers, and citations under each model. While characteristics such as growth, subject, and publisher have been identifi ed by exploring the journal's website only, the citation count of these journals has been calculated by using Google Scholar and the Indian Citation Index. The gold road is now the most popular form of OA publishing in the subcontinent. There is a great variation in the size of OA journals and in their publishers. One publisher has more than 77 journals, but 264 publishers publish a single journal only. Overall, the OA journal landscape is greatly infl uenced by a few key publishers and journals. While 43% of journals charge publication fees and the fees vary from as low as US$10 to as high as US$400, the highest impact factor of the gold OA journals has been noted as 0.58. The data presented here suggest that publication fees are not a major barrier to authorship within the fi elds of computer science, pharmacy, and medicine. © Bhaskar Mukherjee 2014.",,,,,,,,,,,"(2011), http://censusindia.gov.in, Census of India, accessed 13 February 2013; Khatri, N.K., E-journal publishing in India: A case study of Indian Statistical Institute publication: Sankhya-The Indian Journal of Statistics (2009) Proceedings of the International Conference On Academic Libraries (ICAL-2009), pp. 386-388. , Delhi, University of Delhi; Sahu, D.K., Parmar, R., The position around the world: Open access in India (2006) Open Access: Key Strategic, Technical and Economic Aspects, pp. 26-32. , In N.

A digital format was used by 95% of the journals and 82% were open access, with an even higher level of open access in Latin America. The publishers were mainly universities (37.7%) and associations (31.1%). Ibero-American countries, with the exception of Spain, do not have a long tradition as scientific journal publishers, but in the last few years they have gained in importance as players in scientific communication with the use of new business models for journals. © Rosângela Schwarz Rodrigues and Ernest Abadal 2014.",,,,,,,,,,,"He, X., Chinese scientific journals: How they can survive (2012) Learned Publishing, 25, pp. 219-224. , doi:10.1087/20120309; Hu, D., The availability of open access journals in the humanities and social sciences in China (2012) Journal of Information Science, 38, pp. 64-75. , http://jis.sagepub.com/content/38/1/64, Available at; Xian, J., The past, present and future of scientific and technical journals of China (2006) Learned Publishing, 19, pp. 133-141; Sawant, S., The current scenario of open access journal initiatives in India (2009) Collection Building, 28, pp. 159-163. , http://www.anilaggrawal.com/ij/sun-dry/misc/other/sawant.pdf, Available at; Hedlund, T., Rabow, I., Open Access in the Nordic Countries: A State of the Art Report (2007) NorBib, , http://nordbib.net.dynamicweb.dk/Files/Filer/Documents%20for%20download/Open_Acces_in_the_Nordic_Countries_Hedlund_Rabow_Nordbib.pdf, Available at; Greco, A., (2012) Scholarly Publishing In Emerging Nations, , (ed.), Toronto, University of Toronto Press; Anglada, L., Abadal, E., (2010) Open Access In Southern European Countries, , http://www.accesoabierto.net/sites/accesoa-bierto.net/files/OASouthEurope.pdf, eds, Madrid, FECYT, Available at; Rodríguez-Yunta, L., Las revistas iberoamericanas en Web of Science y Scopus: Visibilidad internacional e indicadores de calidad (2010) 7o Seminario Hispano-Mexicano De Investigación En Bibliotecología Y Documentación, , http://eprints.rclis.org/bitstream/10760/14490/1/LuisRY7Encuentro.pdf, Mexico DF.

Text-matching software is a useful tool for measuring the extent of text copying but it cannot detect plagiarized tables or figures, plagiarism of ideas, or plagiarism in translation. Furthermore, a working definition of plagiarism in relation to research reports needs to take into account factors such as the originality of the copied material, its position in the report, the adequacy of referencing, and the intention of the authors as well as the extent of the copying. This article considers all these factors and proposes possible definitions of major and minor plagiarism in relation to scholarly publications which might be used as the basis for anti-plagiarism policies in conjunction with resources such as the COPE fl owcharts. © Elizabeth Wager 2014.",,,,,,,,,,,"Bailey, J., (2013) The World's Fi Rst Plagiarism Case, , http://www.plagiarismtoday.com/2011/10/04/the-world%E2%80%99sfirst-plagiarism-case/, accessed 2 October; (2008) Flowcharts 'What to Do If You Suspect Plagiarism', , http://publicationethics.org/files/u2/02A_Plagiarism_Submitted.pdf, Committee on Publication Ethics, and http://publicationethics.org/files/u2/02B_Plagiarism_Published.pdf, accessed 2 October 2013; (2013) Retraction Guidelines, , http://publicationethics.org/files/retraction%20guidelines.pdf, Committee on Publication Ethics, accessed 2 October; Norman, C., Stanford investigates plagiarism charge (1984) Science, 224, pp. 35-36; Kerans, M.E., de Jager, M., Handling plagiarism at the manuscript editor's desk (2010) European Science Editing, 36, pp. 62-66; (1999) Guidelines On Good Publication Practice, , http://publicationethics.org/annualreport/1999, Committee on Publication Ethics; Kleikamp, E., (2013) CrossCheck-EES Integration Golive Date Announced, , http://editorsupdate.elsevier.com/short-communications/crosscheck-ees-integration-go-live-dateannounced/, 10 September, accessed 2 October 2013; Wager, E., (2013) High-tech Approaches to High-tech Fraud, , www.elsevier.com/connect/high-tech-approaches-to-high-tech-fraud, 15 May, accessed 2 October 2013 Elsevier Connect; Vermette, H.L., Benner, R.S., Scott, J.R., (2013) Value of Plagiarism Detection For Manuscripts Submitted to A Medical Specialty Journal, , http://www.peerreviewcongress.org/index.html, accessed 2 October; Flavall, E., Barbour, V., Bernstein, R., Hickling, K., Morris, M., (2013) Implementation of Plagiarism Screening For PLOS Journals, , http://www.peerreviewcongress.org/index.html, accessed 2 October","Wager, E.; Sideview, 19 Station Road, Princes Risborough HP27 9DE, United Kingdom; email: liz@sideview.demon.co.uk",,,,,,,,9531513,,,,English,Learn.

This article aims to correct this through an analysis of the usage logs of a major cultural, multimedia website, Europeana.eu, which started tackling the mobile challenge in 2011. The challenges of identifying mobile use - no easy matter - are described. The information behaviour of 150,000 mobile users is examined and compared with that for desktop users. The main findings are that mobile users are the fastest-growing user community and that their visits are very different in the aggregate from those arising from desktops. Mobile visits are information 'lite': typically shorter, less interactive, and with less content viewed per visit. Use takes on a social rather than office rhythm, with use peaking at nights and weekends. © David Nicholas and David Clark 2013.",,,,,,,,,,,"The 'Google generation' is a popular phrase that refers to a generation of young people, born after 1993, that is growing up in a world dominated by the Internet; Rowlands, I., Nicholas, D., Williams, P., Huntington, P., Fieldhouse, M., Gunter, B., Withey, R., Tenopir, C., The Google generation: The information behaviour of the researcher of the future (2008) Aslib Proceedings, 60 (4), pp. 290-310. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/00012530810887953; Nicholas, D., Rowlands, I., Virtual scholars: Their characteristics and implications for librarians (2010) Link, 11, pp. 2-3; (2013) Smartphone ownership 2013, , http://pewinternet.org/Reports/2013/Smartphone-Ownership-2013/Findings.aspx, Pew Internet, Available at; (2013) Tablet ownership 2013, , http://pewinternet.org/Reports/2013/Tablet-Ownership-2013.aspx, Pew Internet; Eddy, N., (2013) Mobile Device Users Move to Tablets, Smartphones for Web Access: MWC, , http://www.eweek.com/mobile/mobile-device-usersmove-to-tablets-smartphones-for-web-access-mwc/, eWeek.

At its core, gamifi cation is a way of tapping into motivational forces to increase individual investment in a system, process, or resource; applied correctly, these mechanics could be used to increase engagement with a publisher's back catalogue, drive society members to explore the value their membership offers, and encourage students to connect with on-campus learning resources. Gamifi cation can help satisfy both business and audience objectives, but frameworks have to be carefully designed to avoid some of the common pitfalls that such systems face. Although there are few examples of gamifi cation at work in the learned publishing sector, those who are willing to explore, experiment, and iterate on solutions will be better placed to meet the needs of the increasing 'digital native' student and academic population. © David Armstrong 2013.",,,,,,,,,,,"McGonigal, J., (2010) Gaming can make a better world.

Before the birth of any journal, a very complex journal approval system (JAS) must be negotiated. The paper will first present the history of the JAS in China and then analyze its effect on the scientific journal system. The JAS poses potential risks to the development of journals, and journal quantity rather than quality is the current priority. This needs to be changed and the JAS should be replaced by a journal registration system. Simultaneously, a system in which entry (start up) and closure, if required, is much easier than at present should be introduced, allowing the market to be the principal arbiter of success or failure. © Songqing Lin 2013.",,,,,,,,,,,"(2005) Regulations for Administration of Periodical Publication, , General Administration of Press and Publication (GAPP) of PRC, Beijing; (1951) The Provisional Regulations for Registration of Periodicals, , Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government, Beijing; Liu, X., Proposals on policy reform in managing Chinese sci-tech journals (2001) Chinese Journal of Scientific and Technical Periodicals, 12 (6), pp. 428-430; www.gov.cn; Han, J., China's modern press policy and the development of science and technology societies (2013) Chinese Journal of Scientific and Technical Periodicals, 24 (3), pp. 433-436; Huang, J., Ding, Z., Discussion on the cyclic development of scientific journals in China (1990) Information Science, 11 (1), pp. 10-14; Song, P., State-of-art analysis of Chinese scientific journals (1996) Acta Editologica, 8 (2), pp. 66-72; Gao, Z., State-of-art of Chinese scientific journals (1992) Journal of Information, 11 (4), pp. 50-55; www.gapp.gov.cn/; Hong, L., Problems and countermeasures thinking facing the development of science and technology periodicals in China (2012) Journal of Library and Information Sciences in Agriculture, 24 (8), pp. 158-161; Guo, Y., Zhao, X., Pan, Y., Zhang, Y., Zhu, X., Song, P., Analyses and basic statistics of Chinese sci-tech periodicals (2006) Acta Editologica, 18 (1), pp. 1-4; Wu, S., Wang, Y., Wang, Y., Hu, X., Comparative study on system of ratification or system of registration to innovate China's administrative mode governing scientific and technical journals (2008) Chinese Journal of Scientific and Technical Periodicals, 19 (3), pp. 346-349; Zhu, X., Song, P., Reflects on policy renovation of Chinese sci-tech periodical management (2006) Acta Editologica, 18 (2), pp. 83-86; Huang, S., Lagging of current Chinese sci-tech journal management system and its countermeasures (2004) China Publishing Journal, 5, pp. 45-46; www.nmletters.org; www.jdiabetes.com; http://cjip.oxfordjournals.org/; Xiao, H., Consideration on how to put idea of scientific development in managing sci-tech journal (2005) Chinese Journal of Scientific and Technical Periodicals, 16 (6), pp. 884-888; Zhao, W., Wang, W., Logic of the market realization of scientific journals and its method (2012) Science-Technology and Publication, 3, pp. 28-30; Lin, S., Dong, Y., On several thorny problems in Chinese scientific journals reform (2013) Chinese Journal of Scientific and Technical Periodicals, 24 (3), pp. 441-444; Hu, Z., The homogenization of academic journals and influence study (2009) Fujian Tribune (The Humanities & Social Sciences Monthly), 1, pp. 117-119; Zhou, L., Hou, G., Influencing factors and countermeasures on the development of Chinese scientific journals (2006) Acta Editologica, 18 (SUPPL.), pp. 81-83; http://zt.cast.org.cn/n435777/n435799/n1105056/n12644369/12649185.html; Lin, S., Why serious academic fraud occurs in China (2013) Learned Publishing, 26 (1), pp. 24-27. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1087/20130105; Fang, Q., Xu, L., Marketoriented reform in Chinese scholarly publishing (2013) Learned Publishing, 26 (2), pp. 135-138. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1087/20130211","Lin, S.; State Key Laboratory of Geomechanics and Geotechnical Engineering, Institute of Rock and Soil Mechanics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Wuhan 430071, China; email: sqlin@whrsm.ac.cn",,,,,,,,9531513,,,,English,Learn.

The research findings challenge traditionally held notions about the lack of satisfaction in either the process or fi nal product in self-publishing. By contrast, the authors researched emerged as very satisfi ed with the process of self-publishing, likely to do it again and recommend it to others - and these trends were observed across all the demographic categories and types of content. The generally high rate of republishing among the cohort can be taken as further evidence of associated satisfaction.

Authors receive the reviews as well as a detailed journal recommendation report in 1-2 weeks. This service is designed to improve journal selection, supplement editorial reviews, and make peer review more portable between journals.

Positions on key issues including green and gold OA, funding article-processing charges (APCs), and publication licences are assessed. Modelling of potential APCs as a percentage of overall annual research spend is undertaken to show possible costs of a chargedfor gold system. Medical research charities clearly regard OA as important and some see it as an opportunity to further their mission. However, many expressed signifi cant concerns particularly about the costs and expertise required to support OA. Further co-ordination of policy development and action across the sector and with other stakeholders is recommended in order to help ensure optimal implementation of OA. © Stephen Pinfi eld 2013.",,,,,,,,,,,"Finch, J., (2012) Accessibility, Sustainability, Excellence: How to Expand Access to Research Publications, , www.researchinfonet.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Finch-Group-report-FINAL-VERSION.pdf, Report of the Working Group on Expanding Access to Published Research Findings; (2013) RCUK Policy on Open Access and Supporting Guidance, , www.rcuk.ac.uk/documents/documents/RCUKOpenAccessPolicy.pdf, RCUK; (2013) Open Access and Submissions to the REF Post-2014, , www.hefce.ac.uk/media/hefce/content/news/news/2013/open_access_letter.pdf, HEFCE; (2012) Scientific data: Open Access to Research Results Will Boost Europe's Innovation Capacity.

The cohort studied emerges as highly educated, often well informed about the publishing process, and generally very positive about the self-publishing experience. As the number of people self-publishing continues to grow and associated technology progresses, a number of fundamental implications for stakeholders in both the non-fi ction and fi ction publishing business pipelines are noted. With disintermediation now widespread, there will be increased pressure on the traditional industry to adapt its business models and focus on adding value. At the same time, opportunities in publishing services can be identifi ed and the role of the author is signifi cantly enhanced.

These approaches have the advantage of enabling instant exchanges of knowledge between academics and are part of a wider search for alternatives to traditional peer review and certifi cation processes in scholarly publishing. However, establishing credibility and identifying the correct balance between communication and scholarly rigour remains an important challenge for digital communication platforms targeting academic communities. This paper looks at a highly infl uential, government-backed, open publishing platform in China: Science Paper Online, which is using transparent post-publication peerreview processes to encourage innovation and address systemic problems in China's traditional academic publishing system. There can be little doubt that the Chinese academic publishing landscape differs in important ways from counterparts in the United States and Western Europe. However, this article suggests that developments in China also provide important lessons about the potential of digital technology and government policy to facilitate a large-scale shift towards more open and networked models of scholarly communication. © Xiang Ren 2013.",,,,,,,,,,,"http://arxiv.org/; http://precedings.nature.com/; http://liquidpub.org/; http://www.plosone.org/; Quirós, J.L.G., Gherab, K., Arguments for an open model of e-science (2009) The Future of the Academic Journal, p. 63. , In B.

The latter 30 years saw a Westernization and commercialization process, in which university management and the academic publishing business imitated the systems of the US despite strong government control. As such, it could be said that the current academic publishing system has only developed for about 30 years; Wang, Q., Academic publishing, an angel or a devil for academia?

Despite huge demands of academic publications, the new journal numbers have been highly limited, which function as license to launch new journals. In this case, Science Paper Online has to use an electronic publishing number to publish print collections of online papers, which is easier to apply but normally for electronic publications only such as CD, DVD, etc; http://www.paper.edu.cn/index.php/default/info/info_detail/3128/; http://www.most.gov.cn/eng/programmes1/200610/t20061009_36225.htm, The platform invites famous scholars to self-archive important publications, which greatly improves the overall quality of open access repository; meanwhile, regular academics can also self-archive their publications, which are categorized separately as 'self-recommended scholars'. So far the scholars' self-archiving platform has attracted 75 members of the Chinese Academies of Science and Engineering, 304 top scholars in Chinese National High-tech R&D Programs 873 and 863, and 118 Changjiang scholars and in total over 100,000 high-quality publications. Meanwhile, Science Paper Online is also an integrated database for open access journals in China. Its open access repository has attracted over 400 Chinese journals that signed an open access agreement and has collected 452,503 journal papers: See http://www.paper.edu. cn/index.php/default/info/info_detail/3116 (accessed 4 July 2011); http://www.paper.edu.cn (accessed 5 May 2011); http://www.paper.edu.cn/index.php/default/info/info_detail/3387/, In early 2011, the scientific group functions were added: See; According to interviews with its founder and executive director by author; According to an interview with the author; http://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2011/04/07/paying-for-impact-does-the-chinese-model-make-sense/, See; and http://www.universityworldnews.com/article.php?story=20110227085921588; Science Paper Online has invited top academics in each discipline to form an expert consultancy committee to guide its academic publishing practices.

This study investigated the policies of a large number of computer science journals with regard to the republication of papers which had already appeared in conference proceedings. Nearly one-quarter of journal editors would not republish such papers other than in special circumstances (such as a special conference issue), and almost all of the remainder would do so only after substantial updating and expansion of the original paper. Many specifi ed the amount of content that should be new: 30% was the proportion most frequently mentioned. Thus, many sections of text may be identical to the original paper. However, some journal editors do not appear to consider this self-plagiarism provided the original publication is properly cited. Nevertheless, such (re)publication is likely to lead to high similarity scores in CrossCheck; in this fi eld, therefore, journal editors need to exercise particular discretion when evaluating CrossCheck results. © Yuehong (Helen) Zhang and Xiaoyan Jia 2013.",,,,,,,,,,,"(2012) Policy on Journal Publication of Conference Papers, , http://cognitivesciencesociety.org/conference_Archival.html#top, Cognitive Science Society; Drott, M.C., Reexamining the role of conference papers in scholarly communication (1995) Journal of the American Society for Information Science, 46 (4), pp. 299-305. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/(SICI)1097-4571(199505)46:4%3C299::AID-ASI6%3E3.0.CO;2-0; Fortnow, L., Time for computer science to grow up (2009) Communications of the ACM, 52 (8), p. 33. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/1536616.1536631; Franceschet, M., The role of conference publications in CS (2010) Communications of the ACM, 53 (12), pp. 129-132. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/1859204.1859234; Montesi, M., Owen, J.M., From conference to journal publication: How conference papers in software engineering are extended for publication in journals (2008) Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology, 59 (5), pp. 816-829. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/asi.20805; Patterson, D., Snyder, L., Ullman, J., (1999) Best practice memo: Evaluating computer scientists and engineers for promotion and tenure, , http://www.cra.org/uploads/documents/resources/bpmemos/tenure_review.pdf; Zhang, Y.H., CrossCheck: An effective tool for detecting plagiarism (2010) Learned Publishing, 23 (1), pp. 9-14. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1087/20100103, (Helen); Zhang, Y.H., Jia, X.Y., A survey on the use of CrossCheck in detecting plagiarism in scholarly journal articles (2012) Learned Publishing, 25 (4), pp. 292-307. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1087/20120408, (Helen); Bowyer, K.W., (2012) Mentoring advice on 'conferences versus journals' for CSE faculty, , http://nd.edu/~kwb/Mentoring_Conferences_Journals.pdf, (August 2012); Campbell, B., (2012) Conference paper selectivity and impact: A brief overview, , Wiley-Blackwell Publishing News, September; Freyne, J., Coyle, L., Smyth, B., Cunningham, P., Relative status of journal and conference publications in computer science (2010) Communications of the ACM, 53 (11), pp. 124-132. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/1839676.1839701; Menczer, F., Abolish conference proceedings (2009) Communications of the ACM, 52 (11), p. 6; Vardi, M., Conferences vs. journals in computing research (2009) Communications of the ACM, 52 (5), p. 5. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/1506409.1506410; Zhang, L., Glanzel, W., Proceeding papers in journals versus the 'regular' journal publications (2012) Journal of Informetrics, 6, pp. 88-96. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.joi.2011.06.007; Colebatch, C., (2012) Copyright on the Conference Circuit, , http://www.brocku.ca/webfm_send/22504; Journal-is a conference paper eligible for publication in the AIJ?, , http://www.ida.liu.se/ext/aijd/authors.html, Elsevier, Artificial Intelligence Journal Editorial Website.

Additionally, all stakeholders would benefi t from a standardized method by which one can ascertain what form of open access any content may be; indeed, there are many definitions of open access. There is ample evidence that every publisher handles their content metadata differently and this creates ineffi ciencies in the scholarly information supply chain and leads to user confusion. Many initiatives are currently working on solutions to these problems including the NISO KBART workgroup, NISO's Open Discovery Initiative, and NISO's very recently created Open Access Initiative.

Although the so-called GPRC-label is in principle a welcome initiative, its implementation, from 2010 onwards, has already engendered several unexpected side-effects. This article discusses these pitfalls and traces their origin in the Flemish performance-based research funding system. It also points to a number of hard-to-solve practical problems if the quality label were to be implemented in an international context. In this way, it aims to temper the enthusiasm with which the label has been welcomed, both in Flanders and internationally. © Pieter Borghart 2013.",,,,,,,,,,,"Since the 1970s, the previously unitary Belgium has gradually evolved into a federal state divided into three language communities (Flemish-, French-, and Germanspeaking) and three economic regions (the Flemish, the Walloon, and the Brussels-Capital). As a consequence, some functions are executed on the federal level, whereas others are regionally or communally organized. As education and research belong to the linguistically determined communal level, the Flemish Community is responsible for the university funding system in the northern, Dutch-speaking part of Belgium; Verleysen, F.T., Engels, T.C.E., A label for peer-reviewed books (2013) Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology, 64 (2), pp. 428-430. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1002%2Fasi.22836; Identifying peer reviewed books (2013) ALPSP Alert, p. 189. , ALPSP; http://www.gprc.be/en/content/what-gprc; http://www.ecoom.be/sites/ecoom.be/files/FAQwhat.pdf; Verleysen, F.T., Engels, T.C.E., A label for peer-reviewed books (2013) Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology, 64 (2), p. 429. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1002%2Fasi.22836; Verleysen, F.T., Engels, T.C.E., A label for peer-reviewed books (2013) Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology, 64 (2), p. 429. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1002%2Fasi.22836; http://www.ecoom.be/en/services/vabb, The latest version can be consulted at; Verleysen, F.T., Engels, T.C.E., A label for peer-reviewed books (2013) Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology, 64 (2), p. 430. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1002%2Fasi.22836; This is all the more surprising as the decree that founded the VABB-SHW and the Authoritative Panel in its current form, issued by the Flemish Government on 12 December 2008, literally stipulates that only publications which 'contribute to the developments of new insights or their application' (Belgisch Staatsblad 06.03.2009, Ed. 2: 20689; my translation) can be taken into account for inclusion in the VABB-SHW. Although the GPRC label is part of the outcome of the decree's operationalization, it focuses almost exclusively on formal procedures rather than quality criteria; http://www.gprc.be/en, This is apparent from a quick glance at the total list of GPRC publications since 2010, even for those who do not read Dutch; This opportunism is also partly due to the paradoxical situation that academics in Flanders-as elsewhere-both have to teach and carry out research, but that only publications relating to the latter are taken into account in the regional PRFS. Rather than forcing publishers to give textbooks a scholarly status by submitting them to peer review, the PRFS itself should be re-evaluated (e.g. by crediting every scholar for a number of non-peerreviewed, 'vertical' publications during his or her academic career); To perform such a role, one could, for instance, think of a co-operation between the Association of European University Presses (AEUP), its American counterpart the AAUP and the ALPSP; http://www.esf.org/research-areas/humanities/erih-european-reference-index-for-the-humanities.html, ERIH was updated for the last time in 2011, Because of lack of agreement, for various reasons, among specialists from several HSS disciplines about its appropriateness to serve as the basis for a PRFS, in 2012 ERIH was replaced in Flanders by the above-discussed VABB-SHW; http://wokinfo.com/publisher_relations/books/forageneralintroductionandhttp://wokinfo.com/media/pdf/BKCI-SelectionEssay_web.pdf, See, for more detailed information. Unlike the Flemish Authoritative Panel, the editorial team of the BkCI does not so much insist on a formal process of peer review, but rather on the books being scholarly, i.e. exhibiting a number of qualities typical of 'academic' publications (presentation of relevant and timely research, complete bibliographic information, etc.). In other words, inclusion in the BkCI is dependent on a careful evaluation of both the format and the content of the monograph or edited volume under consideration","Borghart, P.; Academia Press, Eekhout 2, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium; email: pb@academiapress.be",,,,,,,,9531513,,,,English,Learn.

A better understanding of the challenges faced by researchers who are not native English speakers will enable journal publishers to improve the process of submission for all authors, ensuring that the best papers are published in an efficient manner. We surveyed a sample of international researchers to determine what they perceived as challenges inherent to submission to English-language journals and found that they desire assistance with manuscript formatting and responding to reviewers, as well as clear policies about presubmission inquiries and conflicts of interest. Taking into account these survey results and the experience our company has with international authors, we suggest several small changes to a journal's website, including clearer English and prominent links to select policies and guidelines, that may greatly simplify the submission process for second language authors. © Benjamin Mudrak 2013.",,,,,,,,,,,"(2012) Global Publishing: Changes in Submission Trends and the Impact on Scholarly Publishers., , http://scholarone.com/media/pdf/GlobalPublishing_WP.pdf, Thomson Reuters, Available at: (accessed 20 November 2012); Rowlands, I., Nicholas, D., The changing scholarly communication landscape: An international survey of senior researchers (2006) Learned Publishing, 19, pp. 31-55. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1087/095315106775122493; Rowlands, I., Scholarly communication in the digital environment: What do authors want?

The adoption of digital books is accelerating. The transition to digital information has changed information workflows of researchers by transforming the methods they use to find, store, retrieve, and use information from monographs, journals, and other sources. It has also changed the needs and expectations of scholars in relation to research information.

Most Chinese book publishing houses were required to complete this transformation by 2006 and journal publishers by 2012. Chinese academic publishers, who no longer receive any general subsidies and allowances from government, have struggled to survive since then. During the reform process, many Chinese journals charged their authors page fees, and academic book publishers raised the prices of their publications. The continuing existence of other subsidies, however, means that there is still a degree of dependency in the Chinese system, and it will take time for its academic publishers to grow into real market players and to enhance their competitiveness. © Fang Qing and Xu Lifang.",,,,,,,,,,,"A host unit is the superior unit of a publisher; a competent unit is the applicant who applies to set up the publishing house, and which is also the superior unit of the host unit of the publisher., , A Provisional Regulation on the Duties of Publishing Houses' Host Units and Competent Units circulated by the General Administration of Press and Publication (GAPP) in 1993 stipulates that each Chinese publisher must comprise both a host unit and a competent unit.

The challenge was to deliver dependable information that could serve users with widely differing needs and understanding and to get actionable knowledge to subsistence farmers in particular. This was met by bringing together resources across CABI, particularly by supplementing core publishing capabilities with the knowledge, skills and understanding of the internationally based scientific staff and their network of collaborators. An iterative development process, with scoping, wireframes and prototype delivery, was undertaken with constant feedback from global users. Content needed to be repurposed from CABI's own databases, brought in from international partners and freshly created, and then delivered to each user in a structure that was easy to navigate and had easy to use tools to add value. The product has been widely well received and ongoing development will be guided by lessons learned and new requirements as the Plantwise programme expands. © Margo C. Leach and Shaun L.A.

Some early evidence suggests that publishers are engaged in competition for the new consumers, and their efforts are shifting from marketing and selling subscriptions, to marketing and selling publishing venues (OA journals). Within this context, the article suggests that RSS is a very important cost-effective marketing tool if used properly and can play an important role in the marketing and dissemination process of OA articles, in particular when those articles are published in hybrid journals. The article presents real examples of TOC RSS feeds produced by leading publishers and shows that the benefits and effectiveness of those RSS fees are directly related with the availability, quality and richness of its content. © Santiago Chumbe and Roddy MacLeod 2013.",,,,,,,,,,,"Curry, S., The inexorable rise of open access scientific publishing (2012) The Guardian, , http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/occams-corner/2012/oct/22/inexorable-rise-open-access-scientific-publishing, 22 October 2012; Davis, P.M., Walters, W.H., The impact of free access to the scientific literature: A review of recent research (2011) Journal of the Medical Library Association, 99 (3), pp. 208-217; Björk, B.C., Solomon, D., Open access versus subscription journals: A comparison of scientific impact (2012) BMC Medicine, 10, p. 73. , http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7015/10/73; Alam, S., The growth of open access journals, and a BMC Medicine twitter chat #BMCMed (2012) BioMed Central Blog, , http://blogs.biomed-central.com/bmcblog/2012/10/22/the-growth-of-open-access-journals-and-a-bmc-medicine-twitter-chat-bmc-med/, October 22, 2012; Harnad, S., (2012) The Access/impact Problem and the Green and Gold Roads to Open Access, , http://eprints.soton.ac.uk/265852/2/serev-revised.pdf; McCabe, M., Snyder, C., (2010) The Economics of Open-access Journals, , http://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.914525, Available at; http://www.societyofbiol-ogy.org/documents/view/207, Biosciences Federation report; http://creativecommons.org/, Creative Commons; http://www.wellcome.ac.uk/About-us/Policy/Spotlight-issues/Open-access/Policy/index.htm, Open access: CC-BY licence required for all articles which incur an open access publication fee - FAQ; http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/NEWS/0,contentMDK:23164491~pagePK:64257043~piPK:437376~theSitePK:4607,00.html, World Bank Announces Open Access Policy for Research and Knowledge, Launches Open Knowledge Repository; http://www.emeraldinsight.com/journals.htm?articleid=17055033&show=abstract, Web 2.0: an assessment of social marketing principles; Granitz, N., Koernig, S.K., Web 2.0 and mar-keting education: Explanations and experiential applica-tions (2011) Journal of Marketing Education, 33 (1), pp. 157-172. , DOI: 10.1177/0273475310392539; Core, D., http://dublincore.org/about-us/; Ma, D., (2012), http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.dss.2012.09.002, Use of RSS feeds to push online content to users.

The outcome of this research indicates that although these organizations are aware of the changing role of learned associations in relation to their members and a wider public, they are struggling to embrace the opportunities represented by the transition to electronic forms of interaction within scholarly communities, and are limited by the lack of funding available in the humanities and an historical commitment to traditional forms of publication and evaluation. In conclusion, this study proposes that the future of learned associations in the humanities is closely linked to the future of academic publishers working in these disciplines. © Emma Bennett 2013.",,,,,,,,,,,"Ryan, J., Avelar, I., Fleissner, J., Lashmet, D.E., Hillis Miller, J., Pike, K.H., Sitter, J., Tatlock, L., (2002), http://www.mla.org/pdf/schlrlypblshng.pdf, The Future of Scholarly Publishing.

A 22-question survey was sent to 3,305 recipients, primarily scholarly journal editors from Anglophone countries, and a reduced 10-question version to 607 editors from non-Anglophone countries. The response rate was 5.6%. 42% of all respondents had used CrossCheck in their work. The main findings are as follows: (1) the plagiarism detection tool and its similarity report are extremely useful and effective and can assist editors in screening documents suspected of plagiarism; (2) responses show the journal editors' attitude and level of tolerance towards different kinds of plagiarism in different disciplines; (3) the survey results underscore a clear consensus on editorial standards on plagiarism, but there were small variations between different disciplines and countries, as well as between Anglophone and non-Anglophone. The study also suggests that further work is needed to establish a universal principle and practical approaches to prevent plagiarism and duplicate publication. © Yuehong (Helen) ZHANG and Xiaoyan JIA 2012.",,,,,,,,,,,"Plagiarism, N., (2012) Oxford English Dictionary Online, , http://www.oed.com, 3rd edn.

These surveys were part of the 2011 UK Scholarly Reading and the Value of the Library Study funded by JISC Collections and based on studies conducted by Tenopir and King since 1977. Scholarly articles, especially those obtained from the library's e-journal collections, are a vital part of academic work. Reading patterns of books are quite different than articles; books most often come from personal print collections. Book readings are still important for research and teaching, however, especially for humanists. Academics come into contact with multiple sources of information every day and therefore, convenience and easy access are important factors. Knowing more about academic reading patterns helps publishers and librarians design more effective journal systems and services now and into the future. © Carol Tenopir, Rachel Volentine, and Donald W.

The objective is to provide empirical evidence on real methods and processes, best practices and problems experienced by librarians. The survey adapted Baker and Read's methodology to the French context. One-third of French academic libraries answered the survey. Results show that usage statistics are crucial for librarians' daily work. COUNTER reports are mostly used, specifically the JR1 format. Two-thirds of the libraries enhance the usage statistics with other data. Librarians face three major difficulties: lack of time, lack of usage data produced by French vendors, and the need for customized tools. The article contains a short literature review and ends with recommendations for further studies. It is the first published survey on usage data management in France and allows for comparison with results from other countries. © Chérifa Boukacem-Zeghmouri and Joachim Schöpfel 2012.",,,,,,,,,,,"Bucknell, T., Taylor-Roe, J., Killick, S., Thompson, S., Usage statistics for decision making (2011) Serials, 24, pp. 17-20. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1629/2417; Baker, G., Read, E.J., Vendor-supplied usage data for electronic resources: A survey of academic libraries (2008) Learned Publishing, 21, pp. 48-57. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1087/095315108X247276; Boukacem-Zeghmouri, C., Schöpfel, J., Statistiques d'utilisation des ressources électroniques en ligne: Le projet COUNTER (2005) Bulletin des Bibliothèques de France, 50, pp. 62-66; http://counter.inist.fr/; Boukacem-Zeghmouri, C., (2010) L'information scientifique et technique dans l'univers numérique.

This paper sets out to address this by reporting on how well they are used, what they are used for, what researchers' think of them, and where they thought they were going. Nearly 1,700 scientific researchers, mostly physical scientists, responded to an international survey of digital repositories, making it the largest survey of its kind. High deposit rates were found and mandates appear to be working, especially with younger researchers. Repositories have made significant inroads in terms of impact and use despite, in the case of institutional repositories, the very limited resources deployed. Subject repositories, like arXiv and PubMed Central, have certainly come of age but institutional repositories probably have not come of age yet although there are drivers in place which, in theory anyway, are moving them towards early adulthood.©David Nicholas, Ian Rowlands, Anthony Watkinson, David Brown and Hamid Jamali 2012.",,,,,,,,,,,"Poynder, R., (2011), http://poynder.blogspot.com/2011/06/open-access-by-numbers.html, Open Access by Numbers, Open and Shut, (accessed 20 March 2012); Laakso, M., Welling, P., Bukvova, H., Nyman, L., Björk, B.-C., The Development of Open Access Journal Publishing from 1993 to 2009 (2011) PLOS ONE, 6 (6), pp. e20961. , doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0020961; www.opendoar.org/countrylist.php, accessed 12 January 2012; Covering Dissertations Or Data, For Instance; www.peerproject.eu/, accessed 12 February 2012; Coming of Age?

Specifically all the 15,478 submissions to EPL (formerly Europhysics Letters) submitted within the 12 years from 1999 to 2010 are included. While trends in the yearly number of submitted papers can be seen, these are also reflected in the number of accepted and rejected papers. Monthly fluctuations in the rate of acceptance are strong; averaging over several years smoothes these fluctuations and shows a clear maximum in July. Even more conspicuous fluctuations are found for the acceptance time, i.e. the duration of the reviewing process.

Yet CIBER's research points to the fact that 'lite' reading is in fact endemic: younger people prefer it anyway and older people are getting used to it for the speed and convenience it brings. PDFs are largely a means of archiving and collecting and are not the gold standard reading metric people think.

However, the learning process through which reviewers acquire their reviewing ability, and reviewers' own perceptions of their capability have rarely been a focus. This interview study asked three questions about reviewer capability and training. At what stage did you gain confidence in reviewing? How did you learn how to review? Is formal training necessary? The interview is part of a mixed-method project studying experienced Australian reviewers. The respondents indicate that learning to review is a continuous cycle in which formal training will not work. Following a mostly self-guided initiation, new reviewers establish personal reviewing patterns. By trial and error, the patterns are consolidated and the reviewers eventually feel 'confident'. 'Decisiveness' is a good sign of becoming confident. Most respondents emphasized that journals could play a crucial role in producing good reviewers, e.g. by specifying unambiguously their expectations of 'good reviews'. © Yanping Lu 2012.",,,,,,,,,,,"Chubin, D.E., Hackett, E.J., (1990) Peerless Science: Peer Review and US Science Policy, p. 2. , Albany, NY: State University of New York Press; Loonen, M.P.J., Hage, J.J., Kon, M., Who benefits from peer review?

To gain the largest scientific impact and market value from research, drug company articles placed in medical journals are often written under the names of independent medical researchers. Pharmaceutical company statisticians, reviewers from a diverse array of company departments, medical writers, and publication planners are only rarely acknowledged in journal publications, and key company scientists only sometimes acknowledged. The public knowledge that results from this ghost-managed research and publication is a marketing tool, providing bases for continuing medical education, buttressing sales pitches, and contributing to medical common sense and further research. In the pharmaceutical industry, knowledge is a resource to be accumulated, shaped, and deployed to best effect.

The Publishing Research Consortium commissioned a study on content mining of scholarly journal articles with 29 expert interviews and an international survey among publishers. The main results are: (i) content mining developments appear to be accelerating with more applications in more areas; (ii) third-party demand for content mining is widespread but still at low levels of frequency; (iii) publishers'permissions for content mining are quite liberal, especially for research-driven mining requests; (iv) half of the publisher respondents undertake mining of their own content; and (v) content mining is on the rise - publishers and third parties both report an increase in planned mining activities. As content mining of journal articles spreads and intensifies, cross-publisher solutions can better help facilitate content mining. The study investigated the interest and willingness of publishers to support a set of different solutions, from one shared content mining platform to commonly agreed access terms for mining and standardization of mining-friendly content formats. © Eefke Smit and Maurits van der Graaf 2012.",,,,,,,,,,,www.publishingresearch.net/documents/PRCSmitJAMreport20June2011VersionofRecord.pdf; Note,"Eefke, S.; Bronfonteyn BVUnited States; email: eefkesmi@xs4all.nl",,,,,,,,9531513,,,,English,Learn.

However, without generally recognized databases that offer free access to medical abstracts in China, many potential readers are lost. In addition, many Chinese readers do not have adequate literature retrieval skills: more convenient access to journals is therefore far more important than earning immediate profits.

It identifies five different but realistic scenarios for moving towards that end over the next five years, including gold and green open access, moves towards national licensing, publisher-led delayed open access, and transactional models. It then compares and evaluates the benefits as well as the costs and risks for the UK. The scenarios, and the modelling on which they are based, amount to a benefit-cost analysis to help in appraising policy options. Our conclusion is that policymakers should encourage the use of existing subject and institutional repositories, but avoid pushing for reductions in embargo periods, which might put at risk the sustainability of the underlying scholarly publishing system. They should also promote and facilitate a transition to gold open access, while seeking to ensure that the average level of publication fees does not exceed c.£2.000; that the rate in the UK of open access publication is broadly in step with the rest of the world; and that total payments to publishers from UK universities do not rise as a consequence. © Michael Jubb, Joel Cook, Daniel Hulls, David Jones, and Mark Ware 2011.",,,,,,,,,,,"(2008) Activities, Costs and Funding Flows In the Scholarly Communications System In the UK, , www.rin.ac.uk/system/files/attachments/Activites-costs-flows-report.pdf, RIN, Available at; (2009) Economic Implications of Alternative Scholarly Publishing Models, , http://ie-repository.jisc.ac.uk/278/3/EI-ASPM_Report.pdf, JISC, Available at; (2010) E-only Scholarly Journals: Overcoming the Barriers, , www.rin.ac.uk/system/files/attachments/E-only_report_for_screen_0.pdf, The report of a RIN study on the barriers to a move to e-only provision of scholarly journals in the UK, is available at, The report of a study on gaps and barriers to access, priorities in seeking to fill gaps, and actions that might be taken to that end will be published in the autumn of 2011; Note; Heading For the Open Road: Costs and Benefits of Transitions In Scholarly Communications, , www.rin.ac.uk/system/files/attachments/Dynamics_of_transition_for_screen_0.pdf, RIN, JISC, PRC, RLUK and Wellcome Trust, 2011.

A number of aspects are considered: publishers, journal impacts, countries, and languages. For journals indexed in JCR from 1997 to 2009, just 0.2% of publishers produce 50% of journals and articles, and 0.3% of publishers account for the top 50% of citations, impact factors and immediacy indices. More than a half of publishers in JCR are from four countries: USA, UK, Germany and Japan. In addition, more than a half of journals come from the USA and UK. Examining the publishers' interactions in terms of buying and selling journals shows the extent of change by acquisition, and the acquisition links between publishers. The findings confirm that the international market of journal publishing is essentially dominated by a few publishers. © Fereshteh Didegah and Ali Gazni 2011.",,,,,,,,,,,"Birman, J.S., Scientific publishing: A mathematician's viewpoint (2000) Notices of the American Mathematical Society, 47 (7), pp. 770-774; Beschler, E.F., Pricing of scientific publications: A commercial publisher's point of view (1998) Notices of the American Mathematical Society, 45 (10), pp. 1333-1343; Branin, J.J., Case, M., Reforming scholarly publishing in the sciences: A librarian perspective (1998) Notices of the American Mathematical Society, 45 (4), pp. 475-486; Tonukari, N.J., Research communications in the 21st century (2004) African Journal of Biotechnology, 3 (2), pp. 123-126; Ablamunits, V., The importance of APC (2005) Journal of Autoimmune Diseases, 2, p. 3; Lawrence, S., Free online availability substantially increases a paper's impact (2001) Nature, 411, p. 521; Velterop, J., Should scholarly societies embrace open access (or is it the kiss of death)?

All cases have been reconstructed through documents and interviews.

Using traditional bibliometric indicators for institutions in sub-Saharan Africa, we analyze whether institutional access to TEEAL (a digital collection of journal articles in agriculture and allied subjects) increases: (i) article production; (ii) reference length; and (iii) number of citations to journals included in the TEEAL collection. Our analysis is based on nearly 20,000 articles - containing half a million references - published between 1988 and 2009 at 70 institutions in 11 African countries. We report that access to TEEAL does not appear to result in higher article production, although it does lead to longer reference lists (an additional 2.6 references per paper) and a greater frequency of citations to TEEAL journals (an additional 0.4 references per paper), compared to non-subscribing institutions. We discuss how traditional bibliometric indicators may not provide a full picture of the effectiveness of free and discounted literature programs. © Philip M.

Technical challenges successfully overcome by the project include non-uniformity of manuscript files and metadata formats, embargo management, and author authentication for repository deposit. Three areas of research investigating (i) author and reader attitudes and behaviours, (ii) article-level usage at repositories and publisher platforms, and (iii) the economics of large-scale archiving have been commissioned and are producing results. The baseline behavioural survey identified an increasing general awareness of open access, but a lower awareness of institutional and subject repositories. Perceptions were also found to vary depending on whether individuals were responding from an author or reader perspective. PEER itself has seen low uptake from authors when invited to self-deposit into the project. Further results from all three research areas are due before the project ends in May 2012. © Julia M.

The topic is the second to emerge from the Charleston Observatory, the research adjunct of the popular annual Charleston Conference (http://www.katina.info/conference/). The study shows that social media have found serious application at all points of the research lifecycle, from identifying research opportunities to disseminating findings at the end. The three most popular social media tools in a research setting were those for collaborative authoring, conferencing, and scheduling meetings. The most popular brands used tend to be mainstream anchor technologies or 'household brands', such as Twitter. Age is a poor predictor of social media use in a research context, and humanities and social science scholars avail themselves most of social media. Journals, conference proceedings, and edited books remain the core traditional means of disseminating research, with institutional repositories highly valued as well, but social media have become important complementary channels for disseminating and discovering research. © Ian Rowlands, David Nicholas, Bill Russell, Nicholas Canty and Anthony Watkinson 2011.",,,,,,,,,,,"http://www.rin.ac.uk/our-work/communicating-and-disseminating-research/use-and-relevance-web-20-researchers, RIN.

They have not seen each other's pieces, and while they advocate one or more form, do not in fact disagree as much as might appear at first sight.

The necessity of providing citations for data is not so widely recognized. Proponents of the data-sharing movement have advocated the citation of datasets in order to recognize contributions and enhance access. This study examines a sample of papers from the Inter-University Consortium for Political and Social Research (ICPSR) Bibliography of Data-Related Literature that are based on secondary analysis of datasets available in the ICPSR data archive to determine the data citation practices of authors. The results indicate that many authors fail to cite the data used in secondary analysis studies. Possible reasons for the dismal state of data citation practices are considered, including the recent introduction of data into the scholarly record and its marginalization as an information format. Updating citation practices to include datasets will support data sharing and foster responsible scholarship. © Hailey Mooney 2011.",,,,,,,,,,,"Henige, D., Discouraging verification: Citation practices across the disciplines (2006) Journal of Scholarly Publishing, 37 (2), pp. 99-119. , http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/scp/summary/v037/37.2henige.html, Available at, accessed 2 November 2010; Donovan, S.K., On accuracy in references (2008) Learned Publishing, 21, pp. 74-75. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1087/095315108x254494; Garfield, E., Bibliographic negligence: A serious transgression (1991) The Scientist, 5 (23), p. 14. , http://www.the-scientist.com/article/display/11078/, Available at, accessed 2 November 2010; Ginsburg, I., The disregard syndrome: A menace to honest science?

Influence is measured in terms of foreign contributions, 'equivalent' immediacy scores of recent articles, and the calculation of citations and 'equivalent' impact factor. A total of 580 articles published in the Medical Journal of Malaysia (MJM) between 2004 and 2008 served as the sample. Very few foreign authors contributed to MJM (12.5%), implying its low regional acceptance as a channel for research communication. Immediacy scores for each year indicate citations were received by recently published articles. A total of 1,164 citations were received by 446 of the 580 articles and the main citing sources were journals (1,083) with reasonable h index and impact factor. Yearly impact scores ranged between 0.367 and 0.616. Higher impact factor scores were obtained by older articles. © S.A. Sanni and A.N.

Conjoint analysis revealed the highest rated profiles to be (i) article written by a top-tier author, in a top peer-reviewed journal, available online at no personal cost to the reader; and (ii) article written by a top-tier author, in a peer-reviewed journal not in the top tier, available online at no personal cost to the reader.

This case study reviews the objectives, challenges, project phases, impact, and key lessons of a project to research and implement a new tiered pricing model for a society publisher. We analysed current sales and profiled institutional subscribers to define, model, and refine appropriate price tiers. This led to the introduction of fair and transparent pricing that encourages usage, is manageable for supply chain stakeholders and minimizes the need for custom licences. We then planned and implemented a segmented communications strategy to increase current customer awareness of and support for the new pricing, and identified prospective customers and segments for potential sales growth. © Charlie Rapple 2011.",,,,,,,,,,,"http://www.jisc-collections.ac.uk/Help-and-information/JISC-Banding, For further information about JISC Banding for Higher and Further Education Institutions, see; For Further Information About Carnegie Classifications of Institutions of Higher Education™, , http://classifications.carnegiefoundation.org, For further information about Carnegie Classifications of Institutions of Higher Education™, see","Rapple, C.; TBI Communications, 62 Church Road, Wheatley, Oxford OX33 1LZ, United Kingdom; email: charlie.rapple@tbicommunications.com",,,,,,,,9531513,,,,English,Learn.

It attempts to track the various ethical issues that arise among the key participants in peer-review systems: authors, editors, referees, and readers. These issues include: bias, courtesy, conflict of interest, redundant publication, honesty, transparency, and training.

One of the conclusions is that in the present data deluge, it is extremely important that all players in the information chain work together on proper digital preservation of all research output, to ensure its future usability, understandability, and authenticity. This poses a new role for publishers who can ensure better discoverability and citability via good linking and integration of data and publications. © Eefke Smit, Jeffrey van der Hoeven, and David Giaretta 2011.",,,,,,,,,,,"http://www.crystalinks.com/libraryofalexandria.html, Library of Alexandria:; Kuny, T., (1997) A Digital Dark Age?

Log analysis, questionnaires, interviews, and observation were used to collect the information. The results are presented in a FAQ format to make the key findings accessible. The main findings are that journals have become central to most disciplines, and that the e-form has become the prime means of access. The results for history suggest that the old scholarly communication mantras (scientists primarily communicate through articles, historians through monographs) are rapidly breaking down. Indeed, all researchers seem addicted to journal content. Research without this resource now seems unthinkable; journals are a researcher's lifeblood. Gateway services, hugely popular in science, are re-intermediating the broken chain between publisher and reader; they are the new librarians. © David Nicholas, Ian Rowlands and Peter Williams 2011.",,,,,,,,,,,"http://www.rin.ac.uk/; http://www.ucl.ac.uk/infostudies/research/ciber/; Nicholas, D., Rowlands, I., Huntington, P., Jamali, H., Salazar, P., Diversity in the e-journal use and information seeking behaviour of UK researchers (2010) Journal of Documentation, 65 (2), pp. 409-433. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/00220411011038476; (2009), http://www.rin.ac.uk/our-work/communicating-and-disseminating-research/e-journals-their-use-value-and-impact, CIBER, E-journals, their use, value and impact.

Yet a similarly rigorous assessment of content also happens a level up, when looking at the quality of journals that apply for indexing in bibliographic databases. Scopus, an abstract & citation database provided by Elsevier, indexing 18,000 scientific titles, is receiving an increasing number of title suggestions; in 2009 this grew to almost 5,000 in that year alone. Some of the suggested journals are dedicated to niche areas and/or are published in other languages than English. To ensure a fair and transparent evaluation of these titles and to address the rising interest in being indexed, Scopus redesigned its entire title evaluation process - basing it on a metrical scorecard and on the principles of peer review. By developing an online editorial system - the Scopus Title Evaluation Platform (STEP) - Scopus also created the prerequisite of an improved communication with publishers and editors about their journals. © Ove Kähler 2010.",,,,,,,,,,,"http://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2010/01/04/why-hasnt-scientific-publishing-been-disruptedalready/; (2009) Technology and Industry Scoreboard, , OECD Science; (2008), http://www.nsf.gov/statistics/seind08/, NSF Science and Engineering Indicators; Note; SJR Represents SCImago Journal Rank, , http://info.scopus.com/journalmetrics/, SNIP stands for Source-Normalized Impact per Paper, Both metrics are based on Scopus data; http://www.fkf.mpg.de/ivs/literaturflut.html; note; note; Ware, M., Mabe, M., (2009) The STM Report: An Overview of Scientific and Scholarly Journal Publishing, , http://www.stm-assoc.org/2009_10_13_MWC_STM_Report.pdf; http://www.nlm.nih.gov/pubs/factsheets/medline.html; http://thomsonreuters.com/products_services/science/science_products/a-z/web_of_science; http://www.info.scopus.com/scopus-in-detail/facts/; note; Taken From Research Trends, , http://www.info.scopus.com/researchtrends/archive/RT14/re_tre_14.html; de Moya, F., Coverage analysis of Scopus: A metric approach (2007) Scientometrics, 73, pp. 53-78; Garfield, E., Citation Indexing (1979) Its Theory and Application In Science, Technology and Humanities, , Wiley, New York; http://www.info.scopus.com/scopustraining/resourcelibrary/; http://www.info.scopus.com/scopus-in-detail/cover/suggest; note; note; http://www.elsevier.com/wps/find/authored_newsitem.cws_home/companynews05_00359; http://www.info.scopus.com/csab/; http://www.nlm.nih.gov/lstrccommittee/lstrc.html; http://scival.com; Morris, S., (2008) What is Quality In Journals Publishing?, 21, pp. 4-6. , Learned Publishing; note; note; Moed, H.F., (2005) Citation Analysis In Research Evaluation, , Springer, Dordrecht","Kähler, O.; Elsevier BV, Radarweg 29, 1043 NX Amsterdam, Netherlands; email: kahler@elsevier.com",,,,,,,,9531513,,,,English,Learn.

A sample of 100 researchers was given a semi-structured questionnaire; 45 subjects responded. The responses were confidential and anonymous. Over two-thirds of the respondents were aware of authorship conflicts, and one-third had actually faced conflicts with their co-authors. Of them, four faced conflicts with their juniors, while 13 faced conflicts with their seniors or supervisors. The primary causes of such conflicts appear to be unethical claims of authorship, violation of authorship order, and deprivation of authorship. In most cases, the victims became frustrated and had to give up, and avoided a direct clash to safeguard their job. Four respondents claimed to have been victimized for raising their voice. Conflict was never resolved in seven cases. To reduce conflicts, respondents suggested that authorship should be decided before the study begins, order of authorship must be determined according to contribution, and a standard code of authorship should be followed strictly. Authorship conflicts arise among researchers mostly due to what they regard as unethical practice of their co-authors, supervisors, and department heads in the absence of any formal authorship policy in the institutions. A standard code of authorship, sensitization of researchers to the problem through open discussions and advocacy, and formation of a grievance redress committee are suggested to minimize such conflicts. Although the sample size was small, some of the specific recommendations will be appropriate in many other cases. © Hasan Shareef Ahmed, Abdullahel Hadi and Nuzhat Choudhury 2010.",,,,,,,,,,,"Uniform Requirements For Manuscripts Submitted to Biomedical Journals: Writing and Editing For Biomedical Publication, , www.icmje.org, International Committee of Medical Journal Editors, October 2005, 14 December 2005; Bhopal, R., The vexed question of authorship: Views of researchers in a British medical faculty (1997) British Medical Journal, 314 (7086), pp. 1009-1012; Hewitt, R.M., (1957) The Physician-writer's Book: Tricks of The Trade of Medical Writing, p. 312. , Philadelphia, W.B.

For half a century after the founding of People's Republic of China, Chinese medical periodicals focused on serving the planned economy, directed as they were by government policies on healthcare and publication. These periodicals scarcely entered the international sphere, and became typical regional publications. This article charts the interesting history of these developments. At the beginning of the 21st century, the growth of international medical exchange put Chinese medical periodicals in a difficult position: both good submissions and subscriptions are insufficient for viability. In today's multicultural world, the internationalization of Chinese medical periodicals can be accomplished by promoting the internationalization of TCM and regional medicine. The ability to ensure academic independence and control of their economic management are essential if these periodicals are to thrive. © Min SHEN, Wan-jie JIANG, Shu-sen ZHENG 2010.",,,,,,,,,,,"Wang, Z.Y., (2000) Thoughts On the Collision and Combination of Traditional Chinese Medicine and Western Medicine, , Master's thesis, Nanjing Agricultural University; He, X.L., (2006) Spread of Western Medicine Into the East and Culture Adaptation, p. 2. , Shanghai, Shanghai Ancient Books Press, in Chinese; Li, C.B., (2006) The Summary of The Research of Christian Medical Enterprise In China, 26, pp. 30-38. , Academic Forum of Nandu; Wang, J.M., Biographies of new medicine pioneers in China - Glasgow John Kerr (1941) National Medical Journal of China, 27, pp. 772-774; He, X.L., (2006) Spread of Western Medicine Into the East & Culture Adaptation, p. 7. , Shanghai, Shanghai Ancient Books Press; Brief Introduction to The Chinese Medical Journal, , http://www.cmj.org/aboutus/information.asp?infoclass=HC, accessed 24 April 2009; Wang, R., Medical journals (2009) Headstream of Chinese Modern Scientific Periodicals (Part 2) (1792-1949), pp. 478-483. , In Yuan Yao, R.

Usage data collected from the IEEE Xplore statistics website demonstrated some interesting patterns of user behavior. Usage of the database increased steadily from 2005 to 2007, but dropped in 2008 due to the launch of the library's new website; off-campus usage was high in the first two years, but plunged in 2007 and 2008. Users from the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, and, to a lesser degree, from the Computer Science Department, were identified as major users of the database by IP statistics. The most heavily used journals and articles indicated that solid-state circuits, microwave, information theory, and power systems were probably among core research areas in electrical and computer engineering for the university.

The systematic interpretation of their comments and descriptions of their own experiences and opinions offers an image of scholars who enthusiastically embrace the electronic information environment, in spite of some frustrations with its imperfections. Their use of e-journals, Internet resources, and email communication has become indispensable to their scholarly activities, and has profoundly changed the way they interact with information, create new knowledge, and relate to their university library. For these faculty members, e-journals have supplanted the print format, because of their convenience, flexibility of work location, advantages for interdisciplinary access, and ease of storage. © Kitty McClanahan, Lei Wu, Carol Tenopir and Donald W.

Of the 28,259 papers published in 2000, 26.89% were freely accessible, with the share varying among disciplines. Articles in the social and behavioral sciences were the most widely available for free. This disciplinary divide applies also to the strategies used to offer open access to documents. In clinical medicine, life sciences, arts and humanities and social sciences open access was mainly based on the publishers' side, while subject-based repositories were dominant in physical, chemical and earth sciences and deposit on homepages was the preferred strategy in engineering, computing and technology. Institutional and general repositories seem to play a minor role in providing free access to the Spanish peer-reviewed literature. Papers published in commercial journals are less accessible than those that appear in non-commercial journals, and we found overlaps in almost 20% of papers deposited. The fastest way to gain open access is to deposit in subject-based repositories and the longest delays are related to deposits in homepages and especially to institutional repositories. Open access to Spanish peer-reviewed articles is dominated by the passive mechanism of the ""gold route"" and the editorial strategy with self-archiving practices in the minority and directed mainly towards subject-based repositories and homepage posting of the papers. The results of this study could serve as a reference point for further study on the evolution of open access in Spain. © Nerea Rodríguez-Armentia and Carlos B.

By means of in-depth interviews with the editors, we explored their indexing and circulation strategies and examined certain organizational and contextual variables that may have helped them to remain in circulation. We also considered whether a combination of electronic publication and open access to the contents of the journals have increased the visibility of science from these developing countries. When these journals were not available electronically, even if they were distributed at no cost, their distribution was necessarily selective, and one could not properly speak of open access; once they were put on the Web, however, they became widely available at no cost to the reader. The editors' views on open access are also explored. © Catalina Estrada-Mejía and Clemente Forero-Pineda 2010.",,,,,,,,,,,"(1962) Guía de publicaciones periódicas, científicas y técnicas de América Latina: Una lista anotada, p. 193. , Unión Panamericana, [in Spanish].

This case study explains why and how Oxford Journals went about obtaining ISO 9001:2008 certification. The overall objective of gaining this certification was to create a standardized framework for the processes by which high-quality products were created and service given, to the satisfaction of all customers. Oxford Journals wanted to demonstrate to societies, editors, authors, and subscribers that there was a robust methodology in place for the management of quality in relation to its operational processes. This case study documents what Oxford Journals had to do in order to gain this certification, the timescales involved, how the project was initiated, the preparations for the external audit, and how the ongoing maintenance of the certification is now handled. It also considers some lessons that were learned during the certification process. © Maxine Smith 2010.",,,,,,,,,,,,"Smith, M.; Oxford Journals, Great Clarendon Street, Oxford OX2 6DP, United Kingdom; email: Maxine.smith@oxfordjournals.org",,,,,,,,9531513,,,,English,Learn.

We tested whether this seasonal submission bias decreases the likelihood of a paper being accepted in that period. Month of submission data was obtained for all 575 publications in PS for the period 2003-2006. Whereas submissions to PS were higher in the summer, there was no evidence that most accepted publications were originally submitted in the summer. Thus, contributors submit to PS when the likelihood of acceptance is the lowest - creating their own entrance barrier. A similar seasonal pattern was not identified for Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, another top psychology journal. Using the Web of Knowledge database, we further assessed whether overcoming the seasonal entrance barrier influences the number of citations a paper receives in subsequent years. We discuss the possibility that the different rejections policies in the two journals, employing desk rejections or not, may explain this discrepancy, and explore a range of alternative hypotheses. © Shaul Shalvi, Matthijs Baas, Michel J.

Of those adopting OA models, the majority seek to cover costs through author-side charges in the region of US$1,000-3,000. Optional or 'hybrid' OA models are increasingly commonplace, although most are experiencing uptake of below 10%, with some notable exceptions. Early evidence from these initiatives suggests that OA leads to an increase in online usage. Meanwhile numerous fully OA journals have launched, and a few subscription journals have made the transition to full OA. Several case studies indicate that fully OA models reliant upon author-side charges are viable, depending on authors being able and willing to pay publication charges, and other influential factors including rejection rate. Most authors continue to rank other considerations, including speed of publication, quality of peer review, and impact factor, as more important than a journal's OA policies, although funder and university-level mandates seem likely to have an increasing influence on an author's choice of where to publish. This article provides a number of case studies of gold OA journals - both hybrid and fully OA - with a particular focus on the sustainability of these models. © Claire Bird, 2010.",,,,,,,,,,,"A Joint Statement By the International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions and The International Publishers Association, , http://www.ifla.org/files/hq/documents/enhancing-the-debate-on-open-access_final-20090505.pdf, Enhancing the Debate on Open Access, Available at, (accessed 30 September 2009); Cox, J., Cox, L., (2008) Scholarly Publishing Practice: Academic Journal Publishers' Policies and Practices In Online Publishing, , http://www.alpsp.org/ngen_public/article.asp?aid=24781, Third survey, Available at, (accessed 30 September 2009); http://www.oxfordjournals.org/oxfordopen, (accessed 30 September 2009); http://www.wiley.com/bw/journalnews/PDFS/sep09.pdf, (accessed 13 November 2009); Bird, C., Oxford Journals' adventures in open access (2008) Learned Publishing, 21, pp. 200-208. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1087/095315108X288910, (accessed 30 September 2009); Bird, C., Fox, K., Roberts, R., Editorial - publication charges (2008) Nucleic Acids Research, 36, pp. 4821-4822. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkn521, (accessed 30 September 2009); http://nprc.incf.org, (accessed 5 October 2009); PLoS Progress Report June 2009, , http://www.plos.org/downloads/progress_report.pdf, (accessed 5 October 2009); http://www.springer-sbm.de/index.php?id=291&backPID=131&swords=biomed%20central&L=0&tx_tnc_news=4970&cHash=b2625780eb, (accessed 5 October 2009); Davis, P., Lewenstein, B.V., Simon, D., Booth, J.G., Connolly, M.J.L., Open access publishing, article downloads, and citations: Randomised controlled trial (2008) BMJ, 337, pp. a568. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/bmj.a568, (accessed 6 October 2009); http://www.sherpa.ac.uk/juliet/, (accessed 5 October 2009); http://www.peerproject.eu, (accessed 5 October 2009)","Bird, C.; Oxford Journals, Oxford University PressUnited Kingdom; email: claire.bird@oxfordjournals.org",,,,,,,,9531513,,,,English,Learn.

Specific tools were developed for the study to enable like-for-like comparison of the journals. Detailed information on current trends in revenue, costs, and surplus is included. Significant differences between HSS and STM journals are reviewed. Open access to research articles on publication as the 'gold' author/producer-pays approach would not be sustainable for this sample of HSS journals for reasons articulated in the report.

The average self-citation rates of these journals for the years 2005-2007 were 0.113 ± 0.124, 0.099 ± 0.098 and 0.092 ± 0.089, respectively, i.e. a downward trend year by year. The upper limits of normal values of self-citation rates for the same period were 0.316, 0.260 and 0.238, respectively. A significant difference was found in self-citation rate between biomedical journals of different subjects. 52 Chinese biomedical journals had no self-citation in 2007. The total citation frequency and impact factor of these 52 biomedical journals were 263 and 0.206, respectively, which were very much lower than the average levels of all Chinese biomedical journals in 2007. A self-citation rate higher than the upper limit was considered as excessive self-citation: 62 (7.01%), 68 (7.69%) Liu Xue-Li and 66 (7.47%) biomedical journals showed excessive self-citation in the years 2005-2007, respectively. However, a certain amount of self-citation is reasonable and necessary. © Liu Xue-Li and Wang Mei-Ying 2010.",,,,,,,,,,,"Garfield, E., Citation indexes for science: A new dimension in documentation through association of ideas (1955) Science, 122 (3159), pp. 108-11. , doi:10.1126/science.122.3159.108; Garfield, E., Citation analysis as a tool in journal evaluation (1972) Science, 178 (60), pp. 471-479. , doi:10.1126/science.178.4060.471; Zhang, L.Z., Analyses of functions of impact factor in evaluation of Chinese scientific journals (2003) Acta Editologica, 15 (2), pp. 126-127; Rousseau, R., Jin, B.H., Impact factor and its correlative index in journal evaluation (2001) Chinese Journals of Scientific and Technical Periodicals, 12 (1), pp. 1-6; Xu, X.Y., Chen, Z.Q., Limitation of impact factor in evaluation of Chinese scientific journals (2005) Information and Documentation Work, 3, pp. 98-100; Guo, S.Y., Li, G., Tan, Y.J., Action of inferential factor in evaluating fruit of scientific and Technology Periodicals (2001) Hospital Administration J Chinese PLA, 8 (5); Holden, G., Rosenberg, G., Barker, K., Onghena, P., Should decisions about your hiring, reappointment, tenure, or promotion use the impact factor score as a proxy indicator of the impact of your scholarship?

Krell F.-T.,6701674772;,Should editors influence journal impact factors?,2010,Learned Publishing,23,1,,59,62,,28,10.1087/20100110,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-70749145208&doi=10.1087%2f20100110&partnerID=40&md5=8e7889a56d9cb1ad4b9dbfdcb6d9f767,"Department of Zoology, Denver Museum of Nature and Science, 2001 Colorado Blvd, Denver, CO 80205-5798, United States","Krell, F.-T., Department of Zoology, Denver Museum of Nature and Science, 2001 Colorado Blvd, Denver, CO 80205-5798, United States","The journal impact factor is widely used as a performance indicator for single authors (despite its unsuitably in this respect). Hence, authors are increasingly exercised if there is any sign that impact factors are being manipulated. Editors who ask authors to cite relevant papers from their own journal are accused of acting unethically. This is surprising because, besides publishers, authors are the primary beneficiaries of an increased impact factor of the journal in which they publish, and because the citation process is biased anyway. There is growing evidence that quality and relevance are not always the reasons for choosing references. Authors' biases and personal environments as well as strategic considerations are major factors. As long as an editor does not force authors to cite irrelevant papers from their own journal, I consider it as a matter of caretaking for the journal and its authors if an editor brings recent papers to the authors' attention. It would be unfair to authors and disloyal to the publisher if an editor did not try to increase the impact of his/her own journal. © Frank-Thorsten Krell.",,,,,,,,,,,"Steele, C., Butler, L., Kingsley, D., The publishing imperative: The pervasive influence of publication metrics (2006) Learned Publishing, 19, pp. 277-90. , doi: 10.1087/095315106778690751; Pringle, J., Trends in the use of ISI citation databases for evaluation (2008) Learned Publishing, 21, pp. 85-91. , doi: 10.1087/095315108X288901; Agrawal, A.A., Corruption of journal Impact Factors (2005) Trends in Ecology and Evolution, 20, p. 157. , doi: 10.1016/j.tree.2005.02.002; Smith, R., Journal accused of manipulating impact factor (1997) British Medical Journal, 314, p. 461; Garfield, E., Editors are justified in asking authors to cite equivalent references from same journal (1997) British Medical Journal, 314, p. 1765; Hemmingsson, A., Mygind, T., Skjennald, A., Edgren, J., Manipulation of impact factors by editors of scientific journals (2002) American Journal of Roentgenology, 178, p. 767. , http://www.ajronline.org/cgi/reprint/178/3/767, Available at; Rogers, L.F., Reply (2002) American Journal of Roentgenology, 178, p. 767. , http://www.ajronline.org/cgi/reprint/178/3/767, Available at; Sevinc, A., Manipulating impact factor: An unethical issue or an editor's choice?

Many alternatives to the traditional peer-review process have been suggested; most of these focus on increasing the accountability of the reviewers. Little has been done regarding improving incentives for reviewers. Making the process more attractive to the reviewers improves the efficiency of the process and benefits everyone involved in it. It is perhaps not enough to keep harping on the altruistic values of peer review. Personal profit motives should be addressed as well.

Transfers of journals owned by third parties (mostly societies) have proven to be particularly problematic for librarians and end-users: the most common problems are loss of online access, cancelled subscriptions, and most notably disappearing archives. The UK Serials Group therefore brought representatives from all stakeholders to the table in an attempt to address these problems. The TRANSFER Working Group developed a Code of Practice through an open, consensus-driven process with participation by all interested stakeholders; a legal review was also a crucial step in the development process. The development and release of the TRANSFER Code of Practice is an example of the positive effects of industry collaboration.

But today we have instant access to digital works, and easy, worldwide distribution for almost no cost to the reader beyond those of computers, Internet access, and electricity. The monopolistic mechanism of 'artificial scarcity' now turns one of the most critical advantages of the digital world into something to be fought tooth and nail. The solution is not stronger and longer copyrights. It more likely will emerge from experimentation to find business models that can fund the creation of works, still a costly undertaking, without sacrificing the digital benefit of almost free distribution to everyone who might desire to access them. © Georgia Harper 2009.",,,,,,,,,,,"http://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap1.html#106a, 17 US 106A; Boyle, J., (2008) The Public Domain: Enclosing the Commons of the Mind, p. 209. , http://www.thepublicdomain.org/down-load/, New Haven, CT, Yale University Press; (2008) Mass Digitization, and Copyright Law, Policy and Practice, , http://www.umuc.edu/distance/odell/cip/newsletter/2008_09/news_autumn2008.html#leftarticle1, See, for examples, the section on 'Business models that work with the networked environment's strengths instead of against them' in Harper, G. 2008, University of Maryland University College Center for Intellectual Property, Newsletter of the CIP, Autumn; Actually, there are many examples in the physical world as well as the digital where all costs can be covered without limiting copying and distribution, but there will always be some types of work for which copyright meaningfully enables creation and distribution that would otherwise fall below optimal levels. Nevertheless, that fact may not justify the government's giving copyright monopolies to everyone for everything; Lessig, L., (2008) Remix: Making Art and Commerce Thrive in the Hybrid Economy, , New York, Penguin; Suber, P., (2009) SPARC Open Access Newsletter, , http://www.earlham.edu/&#x007E;peters/fos/newsletter/01-02-09.htm, 1 February 2009; One may add here that having a state-granted monopoly freed authors from covering the costs of production through patronage. As a result, copyright provided the public benefit of supporting a wider range of voices than patrons would likely have chosen to support. Any suggestion that doing without monopoly would revisit upon us the costs of patron-age must necessarily ignore the prospect that patron- age, if it is a viable option in the future, will have to compete with many other business models, just as monopoly will.

A national online journals platform was therefore planned to offer publishers a simple tool for building online versions of their journals and to make them open access. The platform, named Hrčak, was launched in 2006, supported by governmental funds. It currently includes 170 open access (OA) journals. Most journals include backfiles from 2006 onwards; the average archived period is 6.3 years. 56.5% of the journals come from the fields of social sciences and humanities. Metadata from the Hrčak platform are regularly harvested by OA repositories. To increase the number of Croatian journals covered by relevant bibliographic and full-text databases, Hrčak has forged links with Elsevier, Thomson Reuters and EBSCO. So far, the main achievements include assisting publishers in the process of electronic publishing, and improving accessibility to Croatian scientific output. © Jadranka Stojanovski, Jelka Petrak and Bojan Macan 2009.",,,,,,,,,,,"Gibbs, W.W., Lost science in the Third World (1995) Scientific American, 273, pp. 92-9. , http://www.sciamdigital.com/index.cfm?fa=Products.ViewIssuePreview&ARTICLEID_CHAR=082AA6E7-13D1-4610-81F4-EEC68867A24; Marušif, A., Marušif, M., Small scientific journals from small countries: Breaking from a vicious circle of inadequacy (1999) Croatian Medical Journal, 40, pp. 508-14. , http://www.cmj.hr/1999/40/4/10554353.pdf; Canagarajah, A.S., Nondiscursive requirements in academic publishing, material resources of peri- phery scholars, and the politics of knowledge production (1996) Written Communication, 13, pp. 435-72. , http://dx.doi.org/101177/0741088396013004001; Sambunjak, D., Huif, M., Hren, D., Katif, M., Marušif, A., Marušif, M., National vs. international journals: Views of medical professionals in Croatia (2009) Learned Publishing, 22, pp. 57-70. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1087/095315108X378785; Kawa-Jump, S., (2001) How to Publish Your Articles: A Complete Guide to Making the Right Publication Say Yes, , New York, Square One Publishers; Lett, R., East and Central African Journal of Surgery: The Canadian Connection (2002) East and Central African Journal of Surgery, 7, pp. 3-4. , http://www.bioline.org.br/pdf?js02001; Testa, J., Regional Content Expansion in Web of Science (2009) Opening Borders to Exploration, , http://isiwebofknowledge.com/products_tools/multidisci-plinary/webofscience/contentexp/expansionessay/, Available at, (accessed 17 February; Packer, A.L., The SciELO project for Latin America and Caribbean: Advances and challenges of an emerging model for electronic publishing in developing countries Electronic Journal Publishing: A Reader, , http://www.inasp.info/file/370/electronic-journal-publishing-a-reader-version-20.html, Version 2.0.

Most respondents said they knew what OA was, and supported the idea of OA journals. However, although 60% said that they read OA journals and 25% that they published in them, in both cases around one-third of the journals named were not OA. While many were in favour of increased access through OA journals, concerns were expressed about the cost to authors, possible reduction in quality, and negative impact on existing journals, publishers, and societies. By contrast, less than half knew what self-archiving was; 36% thought it was a good idea and 50% were unsure. Just under half said they used repositories of self-archived articles, but 13% of references were not in fact to self-archiving repositories. 29% said they self-archived their own articles, but 10% of references were not to publicly accessible sites of any kind. The access and convenience of self-archiving repositories were seen as positive, but there were concerns about quality control, workload for authors and institutions, chaotic proliferation of versions, and potential damage to existing journals, publishers, and societies. © Biosciences Federation 2009.",,,,,,,,,,,"http://www.bsf.ac.uk/journals/BSFpositionstatement1openaccesss.pdf; http://www.bsf.ac.uk/journals/BSFsurveyreportJuly2008FINAL.pdf; Tenopir, C., King, D.W., (2000) Towards Electronic Journals, , Washington DC, Special Libraries Association; Swan, A., Brown, S., Open Access Self-Archiving: An Author Study, , http://www.jisc.ac.uk/uploaded_documents/Open%20Access%20Self%20Archiving-an%20author%20study.pdf, Truro, Key Perspectives Ltd., 2005.

But by their nature - often small and with limited resources - they are particularly prone to the turbulence currently affecting scholarly publishing. BMJ Journals is itself a society publisher but also publishes under contract for other societies. During 2008, we carried out research to assess societies' evolving needs from their publishing partnerships. The changing expectations and behaviours of the next generation of researchers are considered to be as much of a threat as declining revenues. Societies are planning to expand professional development activities and to maximise their use of emerging technologies to help maintain and grow membership. Although surplus is a low priority for societies and, accordingly, for their publishing programmes, a high financial return is nonetheless a key criterion when choosing publishing partners - as are reputation, technological innovation, and individual title development. © Peter Ashman 2009.",,,,,,,,,,,"http://cheminsight.org; Baldwin, C., What Do Societies Do with their Publishing Surpluses?

On average half of Nordic journals publish online. In most Nordic countries, commercial publishers predominate; however, in Finland the majority are society publishers. The number of open access journals is low, in line with international figures. There is concern to maintain local languages in journal publishing. A majority of the journals publishing in local languages are within social science, humanities, and arts; the STM sector publishes in English. English-language publications are favoured in research assessments, international recognition, and impact, while the visibility of local-language scholarly journals in international databases is low. The Nordbib program supports Nordic scholarly journals and fosters co-operation with publishing companies and learned societies over migration to e-publishing; it also supports open access. The article discusses future challenges for journal publishing, pointing out the problems of small journal publishers and the need for co-operation between stakeholders. © Turid Hedlund and Ingegerd Rabow 2009.",,,,,,,,,,,"http://www.sprakrad.no/Politikk-Fakta/Fakta/Spraakstatistikk/Hovudtal/, Språkrådet, (accessed 15 December 2008); http://www.research.fi/en/performance/scientific_publication, Research.fi, (accessed 15 December 2008); Chen, S., (2008) Email Response Forwarded by Sally Morris to Liblicense Listserv, , 18 November 2008; http://pkp.sfu.ca/?q=ojs, Open Journal System (OJS); Brock-Utne, B., The growth of English for academic communication in the Nordic countries (2001) International Review of Education, 47, pp. 221-33; Höglin, R., (2002) Engelska språket som hot och tillgång i Norden [The English Language as a Threat and Benefit in the Nordic Countries], , Copenhagen: Nordiska Ministerrådet; Fremtidens forskningspublicering - et nordisk samarbejde [Research Publishing for the Future - A Nordic Co-operation].

The partners involved in the building of MTPO - the Mark Twain Papers, the California Digital Library, and University of California Press - created the site on the premise that Web-accessible versions of this content, enhanced by innovative design and site architecture and a suite of research tools, would greatly improve scholars' ability to discover and work with this unique material. Anecdotal feedback supports this premise. Early data analysis confirms the usefulness of facsimiles and browsing functionality. Users tend to prefer simple keyword over complex searches; however, those conducting advanced searches are using the tool flexibly, as we had hoped. Further analysis is expected to improve our understanding of how researchers use these tools in combination. © Lisa Schiff 2009.",,,,,,,,,,,"Hillesund, T., Digital text cycles: From medieval manuscripts to modern markup (2006) Journal of Digital Information, 6. , http://journals.tdl.org/jodi/article/view/jodi-164/65, Available at, (accessed 17 February 2009); Robinson, P., Current issues in making digital editions of medieval texts - or, do electronic scholarly editions have a future?

It is often assumed these are distinct alternative parallel tracks. However, it has recently become clear that there is potential for repositories and journals to interact with each other on an ongoing basis and between them to form a coherent OA scholarly communication system. This paper puts forward three possible models of interaction between repositories and journals; services such as arXiv and PubMed Central, and the work carried out by the RIOJA project, are working exemplars and pilot implementations of these models. The key issues associated with the widespread adoption of these models include repository infrastructure development; changing ideas of the 'journal', 'article', and 'publication'; version management; quality assurance; business and funding models; developing value-added features; content preservation; policy frameworks; and changing roles and cultures within the research community. © Stephen Pinfield 2009.",,,,,,,,,,,"http://www.soros.org/openaccess/read.shtml, Budapest Open Access Initiative, February 2002; (2008) Journal Article Versions (JAV): Recommendations of the NISO/ALPSP JAV Technical Working Group, , http://www.niso.org/publications/rp/RP-8-2008.pdf, April, NISO-RP-8-2008; Morgan, C., Journal article version nomenclature: The NISO/ALPSP recommendations (2008) Learned Publishing, 21, pp. 272-6. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1087/095315108X356699; Lynch, C., Open computation: Beyond human reader-centric views of scholarly literatures Open Access: Key Strategic, Technical and Economic Aspects, p. 2006. , In Jacobs, N.

Now, more than ever, it is important that academic publishers make best use of their journals and provide their readers with access to this high-value content, in a form that can be easily found and used. To that end, Taylor & Francis have taken up the challenge of satisfying researchers' need to have all relevant content available at their fingertips, by digitizing their older journal content, creating subject-based collections of backfiles and putting them online. This article provides an insight into the 'why' and 'how' of the process of digitization of Taylor & Francis's journal archives. The fact that these online backfiles are being requested, purchased, and used demonstrates the added value that publishers may hold in their archives. © Matthew Howells, Ashleigh Bell, Nicholas Everitt and Jennifer McMillan 2009.",,,,,,,,,,,,"Howells, M.; Taylor and Francis, 4 Park Square, Milton Park, Abingdon OX14 4RN, United Kingdom; email: matthew.howells@tandf.co.uk",,,,,,,,9531513,,,,English,Learn.

Since the future of print is increasingly uncertain, the AMS recently implemented a pricing strategy that encourages the migration of institutions to electronic, or at least electronic-plus-print, subscriptions. The change has had the desired impact, with most institutions activating online access; however, a large number have continued to receive the journals in print despite an increasing price differential between online-only and online-plus-print subscriptions. Given this, the AMS plans to continue to offer the print option as long as it is economically viable to do so, and is working toward a pricing structure in which online-only subscribers do not subsidize the print product. © Keith L.

The time spent reading scholarly articles (an estimated average of 132 hours and 240 articles per year) demonstrates their value to faculty's work; over one-third of readings are reported to be absolutely essential, and to affect the reader's purpose in many ways, including helping to improve results, or to broaden or change the focus. Faculty prefer print for personal subscriptions, although library electronic collections provide a majority of readings, and most readings from library collections are from electronic sources; older articles are also more commonly from electronic library collections. Faculty use a variety of means to find articles, including browsing and searching, the latter particularly for research purposes, and to locate older articles.

The SCI was developed as a tool for the historian of science for the purpose of tracing the history of ideas, but it was appropriated by users for purposes for which it was unintended - as a tool for evaluating the literature, individuals, institutions, and countries. The development of a citation tool gave rise to a debate over what is actually measured by citations. The citation-as-reward camp views citations as indicators of quality and impact, whereas the citation-as-persuasion camp views citations as no more than rhetorical devices.

The project reached the following conclusions: authors and publishing staff collaborated in creating new models of scholarship and writing; over the course of the project, attitudes toward digital publications evolved toward acceptance of this new form of publication; the time and costs involved in creating these models exceeded expectations; continued experimentation is necessary in order to keep up with authors' growing expectations in publishing digital scholarship.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,9531513,,,,English,Learn.

When e-books first appeared on the market, librarians very quickly formulated their key requirements. The most important requirement is functionality: it must be possible to look through a book chapter by chapter, and also to get a quick overview of a comprehensive monograph. Usage arrangements, including concurrent usage and use for interlibrary loans, are also important.

Our primary goals were to completely decouple electronic and print subscriptions, to broaden access to content globally, and to address the needs of different market segments so that similar institutions were charged equivalent amounts for comparable usage/need of ACS journals. A cross-departmental team, with the assistance of independent consultants, analyzed multiple layers of customer data before the new model was built. As a result, we have implemented a two-faceted model that separately addresses academic and non-academic subscribers, and that also enables us to assess the relative value of each journal within our portfolio. The process started in 2005 and took over two years to complete, involving numerous staff members and incorporating input from customers worldwide across all market sectors, as well as subscription agents. The model was announced in spring 2007, and applied to 2008 subscriptions.

Over the past two decades, China has made great strides in creating a legal and governmental framework for the administration and enforcement of copyright. But its implementation has left much to be desired, owing partly to inadequate resources of money and personnel, partly to insufficiently harsh penalties for infringement, partly to cumbersome procedures required to bring action against infringers, and partly to a general cultural tolerance for practices that run contrary to cultivating a broad-based respect for copyright. This article proposes that a balance of pressure and encouragement is likely to have the best chances of success in overcoming these problems and ensuring that China will become fully welcomed into the international publishing community. © Sanford G.

Eighty-four senior researchers from 27 Australian universities, who had served as reviewers in education, physics, and chemistry, returned a completed questionnaire. There were significant variations in reviewers' expectations and understanding of reviewing, mostly related to seniority rather than discipline. They valued peer review as a way of maintaining the quality of science publications, and were generally satisfied with the current system; their impression of peer review's effectiveness was significantly correlated with their own experience. They saw reviewing as a professional obligation and part of their personal professional development.

The Report makes a number of recommendations that strengthen the ability of qualifying institutions to make preservation copies of both analog and digital works, including websites, to make replacement copies of works no longer commercially available, and to permit outsourcing.

These systems are the result of a general evolution from paper-based workflows to electronic processes that began in the 1970s. DOS-based systems paved the way for Windows desktop systems and, in the mid-1990s, Web-based peer review. Governmental, academic, and commercial stakeholders all participated in advancing the state of peer review by experimenting with different technologies, workflows, and features.

Since then, around 70 of its approximately 200 journals have adopted an open access model of some kind, providing a unique perspective on the practicalities involved and the potential impact of open access on established academic journals. Under NAR's full open access model, submissions and author satisfaction remain encouragingly stable, and most NAR authors are paying the open access charges. NAR's income per article declined in 2005, but increased once more in 2007. The journal remains financially viable under the new model. Uptake of the optional 'Oxford Open' model varies by discipline. It is highest in the life sciences: in the region of 17-25% for some molecular and computational biology journals.

Big Deal e-fees themselves are a relatively small proportion of journals expenditure, so when budget cuts need to be made, most savings have to be made by cancelling individual journal subscriptions. However, many individual subscriptions are tied by the non-cancellation clauses that are an inherent part of most Big Deals and so cannot be cancelled unless the Big Deal is cancelled first. Typically, half of all downloaded articles are in the unsubscribed portion of the Big Deal. Thus it is impossible to make even moderate cuts in journals budgets without inflicting serious damage to an institution's access to journal articles, with serious implications on research. Both libraries and publishers benefit from the Big Deal, so it is essential that pricing remains affordable. Libraries may need to educate their funders to ensure that they continue to receive adequate funding for Big Deals. © Terry Bucknell 2008.",,,,,,,,,,,"Tenopir, C., King, D.W., Bush, A., Medical faculty's use of print and electronic journals: Changes over time and in comparison with scientists (2004) Journal of the Medical Library Association, 92, pp. 233-241. , http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/picrender.fcgi?artid=385305&blobtype=pdf; Bevan, S., Dalton, P., Conyers, A., How usage statistics can inform national negotiations and strategies (2005) Serials, 18, pp. 116-123. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1629/18116; Baker, G., Read, E.J., Vendor-supplied usage data for electronic resources: A survey of academic libraries (2008) Learned Publishing, 21, pp. 48-57. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1087/095315108X247276; Davis, P.M., Price, J.S., eJournal interface can influence usage statistics: Implications for libraries, publishers, and Project COUNTER (2006) Journal of the American Society for Information Science & Technology, 59, pp. 1243-1248. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/asi.20405; Ball, D., What's the 'big deal', and why is it a bad deal for universities?

A great deal has been written about how end-users expect more 'Web 2.0' features than library catalogues currently provide. New front-end services have been designed by libraries and library system providers to cater for this need. However, not much has been written about the needs of internal library staff who struggle with processing, handling, and supporting the huge volume of electronic resources subscribed to by libraries. Electronic resource management systems have been developed to cater for these needs, and new standards for data interchange with such systems have been developed.

This article explores the legal and commercial issues surrounding DRM from its analogue origins through to the latest market developments. It argues that the implementation of DRM in other media sectors provides valuable lessons to publishers. Acknowledging the practical challenges that DRM has faced, the article suggests that whilst DRM will offer an answer to 'the machine', it must form part of a flexible solution that adapts to the requirements of electronic publishing. © DLA Piper 2008.",,,,,,,,,,,"(2005) Charles Clark: The Answer to the Machine Is in the Machine & Other Collected Writings, , Bing, J and Dreier, T eds, Oslo, Institut for Rettsinformatik; The Whitford Report (Cmnd 6732), for instance, recommended that photocopying from books and journals should be licensed by a collecting society controlled by rights-holders (which led eventually to incorporation of the Copyright Licensing Agency in 1982); For example, in the US, the Sony 'Betamax' case (Sony Corp. v. Universal City Studios, 1984), where the Supreme Court held that the making of individual copies of television shows on a video recorder to watch at a later time for personal use did not constitute copyright infringement and that manufacturers of those videos were thus not liable for contributory copyright infringement. Also the UK case of CBS Songs Ltd v. Amstrad Consumer Electronics pls and another, 1988, where the House of Lords held that Amstrad had not infringed copyright by manufacturing and selling a tape recorder with twin tape decks which enabled users to make their own recording from a pre-recorded tape, primarily because it did not control the use of their machines once they had been sold; (2005), Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios Inc. v Grokster, Ltd; The German Copyright Act, section 53 - brought into force 1 January 1966. For more details on the historical background see Marx, P. (ed). Private Copying: IAEL Yearbook 2007. London, International Association of Entertainment Lawyers, 2007. See http://www.iael.org; The Gowers Review of Intellectual Property was ordered by the UK Treasury in December 2005 and published in December 2006. It proposes a limited private copying right as well as a more 'flexible' approach to exemptions to DRM anti-circumvention law (see further notes below) but does not support a levy. See http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/independent_reviews/ gowers_review_intellectual_property/gowersreview_index.cfm; Although the levy is usually paid by the manufacturer of the recording medium/device, the cost may of course be passed on to the customer via the retail price. It is often argued that the then Conservative Government ultimately did not include a levy within the Copyright Designs and Patents Act in 1988 (legislation which did introduce many of the other recommendations of the Whitford Report) because of concerns over inflation. The European Commission is also concerned that differences between Member States with regard to the existence, scope and rates of such levies has a negative impact on the EU single market see note 22 below; http://ec.europa.eu/information_society/eeurope/2005/all_about/digital_rights_man/index_en.htm, A good starting point for information on all aspects of DRM is the European Commission's own website; A vast amount of technical work has been undertaken into developing the necessary numbering systems, metadata, and rights expression languages again, see the Europa site above for a starting point on these different aspects, with varying degrees of success; June, (2006), http://www.apcomms.org.uk/apig/current-activities/apig-inquiry-into-digital-rights-management/DRMreport.pdf, For an analysis of the concerns of different 'stakeholders, see the report on DRM issued by the UK All Party Parliamentry Internet Group in; The WIPO Copyright Treaty (adopted in Geneva on December 20, 1996), http://www.wipo.int/treaties/en/ip/wct/trtdocs_wo033.html; See Articles 11 and 12 of the above; Note that here 'fair use' is used, as is common in DRM discussions, not in its strict legal sense under US law, but as a wider, more general description of flexibility in copyright law (strictly, the equivalent concept within UK legislation is 'fair dealing', which is more limited in concept than the US law); The French Supreme Court ruled in the well-known 'Mulholland Drive' case Studio Canal v Perquin, 2006 in the context of French levies that no right to private copying existed; see Auf der Maur, R., Copyright Dilemma in the Digital Age, in Marx, P. (ed.), Private Copying: IAEL Yearbook 2007. London, International Association of Entertainment Lawyers, 2007, p. 84; Directive 2001/29/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 May 2001 on the harmonisation of certain aspects of copyright and related rights in the information society, Article 6(4), http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/ LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32001L0029:EN:HTML; For example, in the US, every three years under powers granted under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act there is a 'Rulemaking on Exemptions from Prohibition on Circumvention of Technological Measures that Control Access to Copyrighted Works' (http://www.copyright.gov/1201/anticirc.html). In Australia there has been a recent Parliamentary 'Review of Technological Protection Measures Exceptions'; The Disability Discrimination Act 1995. See http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/ acts1995/1995050.htm; According to the APIG Report (see note 10 above), as at Summer 2006 no one had made a complaint to the Secretary of State under the UK rules, and interested parties were actively taking steps toward voluntary measures; http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/copyright/docs/levy_reform/stakeholder_consultation_en.pdf, See, for example, the table on p. 11 of the European Commission Consultation Paper on the topic; Directive 2001/29/EC - Article 5(2)(b), Article 5(5) and Article 6, http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32001L0029:EN:HTML; http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/copyright/levy_reform/index_en.htm; It is understood that direct intervention by Member States prevented the European Commission issuing a working paper on levy reform in autumn 2006. At the time of writing, it remains unclear whether a paper will be issued in 2007. The disruptive impact of the different levy regimes, especially in relation to digital media, as set out in the Consultation Paper referred to above, appears likely to increase. Further activity in support of DRM generally seems tied up with progress (or lack of it) on levies; The EU's Article 29 Working Party has already pushed for more transparency in DRM implementation and we may see further statements on this; See Baskin, D. Levy Management and Distribution in Marx, P. (ed.), Private Copying: IAEL Yearbook 2007. London, International Association of Entertainment Lawyers, 2007, p. 108; Anyone who has downloaded a music track to their iPod, which uses Apple's proprietary DRM, may have experienced the frustration of being unable to transfer and play the same track on a device equipped with Microsoft's own DRM; http://www.openmobilealliance.org, In the mobile sector interoperability has been partially delivered through the Open Mobile Alliance initiative, This is an ambitious scheme to develop and implement DRM on mobile phones and other wireless devices, from a simple lock preventing the forwarding of a ringtone to more complex licensing terms; The French Competition Council dismissed a claim in 2004 (http://www.conseil-concurrence.fr/pdf/avis/04d54.pdf). There have also been claims in consumer law (see note 31 below); France's Constitutional Council prevented the introduction of a law requiring mandatory DRM interoperability in 2006, but similar proposals have appeared elsewhere, notably in Norway. This forced Apple to re-evaluate its use of DRM and in turn placed pressure on the record labels to at least consider offering DRM-free alternatives during 2007; Sorting out licence terms for the relevant patent pools is, in part, the cause of delays in the roll-out of the Open Mobile Alliance (see note 26 above); Following challenges regarding labelling in several cases in other countries, an agreed approach to DRM labelling is something specifically recommended for the UK in the Gowers Review (see note 6 above); In March 2006 France's second-highest court overturned an earlier decision outlawing copyright protection devices on DVDs and CDs. However, Sony BMG's experience in the US of a copy-protection device on its CDs (which allegedly uploaded software onto the user's PC even if the user refused permission, installed itself invisibly, and also secretly contacted a website every time the CD was played) suggests that such devices may have limited further use. A number of parties filed lawsuits against Sony BMG on the basis that the software constituted 'spyware, which is prohibited in various US states, e.g. Texas and California. Sony BMG ultimately ceased use of this software, thanks to a combination of the lawsuits, consumer pressure, and Microsoft's threats to create antispyware updates that detected and removed Sony BMG's software; For example, Lipman and Chesterman (Chesterman, J. and Lipman, A. The Electronic Pirates: Do-It-Yourself Crime of the Century. London, Routledge, 1988, p. 31) reported that in the early 1980s, losses from book piracy amounted to some £500m a year. Information on online book piracy can be found at http://www.iipa.com/; Adobe's Portable Document Format - an open standard that was originally launched in 1993 and has since developed as a dominant format and de facto standard for printable documents distributed online; See note 26 above; http://www.audible.co.uk, See, for example; Google's Library Project involves the scanning of books from the shelves of major libraries into a searchable database. The aim is to allow Google to display bibliographic data and snippets of text in response to search requests. In the UK this project has only extended to out-of-copyright works or with rights-holder permission. In the US the project was to have included copyright works Google argues that the fair use exceptions in US law can be extended to include this type of digitisation, however, it did agree not to scan the works of rights-holders who explicitly opted out. The response has been high-profile US lawsuits from publishers and authors who dispute this interpretation of fair use and see an opt-out approach as unacceptable. Google is fighting the claims but currently refraining from scanning copyright works without consent. Google attempted to obtain technical information on the copying activities involved in search and aggregation services provided by rivals such as Y; http://www.mpsbookstore.com, See, for example; From a lawyer's perspective, the example contracts contained in the industry bible Clark's Publishing Agreements over the last ten years (7th edn 2007, 6th edn 2003, 5th edn 1999) provide a dramatic demonstration of the contrast between the approaches of trade publishing and other parts of the industry to electronic formats.

Haywards Heath, Tottel Publishing, 2007; http://www.alpsp.org/ngen_public/default.asp?ID=355&groupid=195&groupname=Information, Readers will need no introduction to the open access debate and its importance to the sector but the 'Hot Topics' documents and links at provide a good introduction; Again readers will no doubt be very familiar with this 'alternative' concept of licensing, based largely on the idea that content should be made available for shared use. For more information, see the Creative Commons website (http://www.creativecommons.org); CD sales are declining in the face of illegal music downloads, and new authorized online services are not developing fast enough to match the decline; many therefore currently argue that the major record labels must switch away from distributing DRM-protected music tracks (although with little apparent evidence to show that such a move would increase revenues from downloads). Some in the media industry are choosing to focus on time-sensitive or 'disposable' content, precisely because it is less susceptible to longer-term misuse; Recently, the high-profile video-sharing site YouTube was reportedly only able to sign a deal with one of the major music groups because it promised to launch a form of 'advanced content identification and royalty reporting system' for its platform; The newly formed Digital Watermarking Alliance (http://www. digitalwatermarkingalliance.org/) has a website setting out a range of case studies describing the use of watermarking in both physical and online distribution","Calow, D.; Media Law Team, DLA Piper UK LLP, 3 Noble Street, London EC2V 7EE, United Kingdom; email: duncan.calow@dlapiper.com",,,,,,,,9531513,,,,English,Learn.

This article provides an analysis of the 16 expressions of concern that have been issued, how and when they were issued, and what happened next.

A programme of education and advocacy, particularly among smaller publishers, will be key to improving the efficacy with which OpenURL is currently implemented.

A framework for citation of previous work is important in order to provide an incentive for contributors of such modules. Peer review - the traditional method of quality assurance for scientific articles - must also be applied, although in a modified form, for fact and knowledge modules. The construction of the Common Knowledge Library is a cumulative process; new contributions are obtained by interpreting the contents of existing knowledge sources on the Internet, and the existing contents of the Library are an important resource for that interpretation process.",,,,,,,,,,,"http://sourceforge.net; http://piex.publ.kth.se/ckl; http://www.sherpa.ac.uk; http://www.gnu.org/licenses/fdl.txt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_web; http://www.w3.org/XML; http://www.w3.org/2004/OWL; http://protege.stanford.edu; http://dbpedia.org; http://cn.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page, http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hauptseite; Sandewall, E.

The models tested were: 'Pay-per-View Converting to Subscription and 'Core Plus Peripheral'. One of the reasons for the trials was to try to ascertain how the models compared with the Big Deals offered by publishers, but they also aimed to consider the technical, administrative, and commercial issues that might be involved in operating the models in practice. The trials took place during 2006 and involved five publishers and ten UK academic libraries. The models trialled in practice deviated from those addressed in the report of the original study and were based on accesses charged not on a pay-per-view basis, but on an agreed charge per full-text download. Users at the participating libraries had access during the year to all the journals published by the participating publishers. The trials produced a number of useful findings including the need to exclude charging for full-text downloads that were freely available, implications of usage data from intermediaries, issues of archival access, and budgeting and administrative considerations for both libraries and publishers.",,,,,,,,,,,,"Harwood, P.; Content Complete Ltd.United Kingdom",,,,,,,,9531513,,,,English,Learn.

That said, the responses tend to be relatively simple. They often take the form of folk wisdom, proverbs handed down from one generation to the next that are not so much inaccurate as sometimes unhelpful. Members are variously described as joining to receive the journal, to attend the meetings, to get cheaper insurance, to pay lower page charges, and so on. This article goes beyond the proverbs, by looking at real evidence and emerging trends in society membership and publications.

This article, based on the author's experience as a publisher-turned-consultant advising societies, offers a framework for selecting a partner based on a careful analysis of what the society needs from its publisher in the long term.

Depending on one's background or job sector, it can either represent an exciting opportunity or a resource-draining waste of time. Yet innovate we must, to satisfy our markets' increasing expectations, especially in the online environment. Some brand leaders have separate 'laboratories' where new features and ideas are developed and floated for feedback. In the absence of such a dedicated space, there are several issues relating to innovation within a publishing organization. This article looks at how these are handled at Wiley-Blackwell in the Compass journals team, and tries to distil some working principles.",,,,,,,,,,,,"Lafaye, V.; Wiley-BlackwellUnited States; email: vanessa.lafaye@oxon.blackwellpublishing.com",,,,,,,,9531513,,,,English,Learn.

Research data can be reused to ask new questions, to replicate studies, and to verify research findings. Data become even more valuable when linked to publications and other related resources to form a value chain. Types and uses of data vary widely between disciplines, as do the online availability of publications and the incentives of scholars to publish their data. Publishers, scholars, and librarians each have roles to play in constructing a new scholarly information infrastructure for e-research. Technical, policy, and institutional components are maturing; the next steps are to integrate them into a coherent whole.

In particular, it focuses on the evolution of Web searching, the growing importance of online communities, the potential of Web tools for self-publishing, and the way in which publishers can control their content even post-publication.

In natural sciences, most articles are published in international journals; authors must therefore comply with the policies of their publishers, irrespective of their nationality. For humanities and social sciences, where publication tends to be distributed among many small journals, portals have been created to provide electronic publishing, with varied access policies. Open archives repositories have been in existence in France since 2001; from 2006, a proactive policy led the main research agencies and universities to coordinate their actions towards a common archiving platform, HAL (Hyper Articles on Line), operated by CNRS (Centre National pour la Recherche Scientifique), with individual portals, either thematic or institutional.

The membership lists of six leading publishing associations, and the websites of their members, were also studied. More than half of all peer-reviewed journals in Ulrich's are published by or on behalf of/in association with nonprofit organizations. Other than the top few commercial publishers, there is little difference in size between the two types; the 'long tail' of publishers are small and therefore vulnerable, and yet most are not represented by any trade association. The majority of journals come from the USA or the UK. Nonprofits launch fewer new journals, but are also less likely to dose journals. The quality advantage of nonprofit journals may be reducing, but nonprofit journals still predominate among the most highly cited journals.",,,,,,,,,,,"It also contained additional journals not yet added to the online version; hence the totals differ slightly from those used in the rest of the article; Solla, D., Price, D.J., (1963) Little Science, Big Science, , New York, Columbia University Press; De Solla Price, D.J., Networks of scientific papers (1965) Science, 149, pp. 510-515. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.149.3683.510; Meadows, A.J., (1993) The International Serials Industry, , Woodward, H. and Pilling, S, eds, Aldershot, Gower; Meadows, A.J., (1998) Communicating Research, , London and San Diego, Academic Press; Tenopir, C., King, D., Trends in scientific scholarly journal publishing in the United States (1997) Journal of Scholarly Publishing, 28, pp. 137-170; Brown, D. 2003.

Engaging the academic community in ownership of the process is essential.

This prototype also envisioned distribution of different publishing functions throughout the consortium: 'It may turn out that, rather than have presses assume these added duties and costs [like SGML coding and archiving, which a CNI report at the time assumed publishers would have to undertake in the new electronic age, it will be more practical for other entities in the CIC universities to provide them, perhaps with some universities offering centralized service for the entire consortium.

Thatcher's review of The Digital Dilemma, 2000, Journal of Scholarly Publishing, 32: 50-57, available at 'Indeed, a good argument could be made, on the very criteria set forth in Appendix D on the economics of information, that the most efficient model for university press publishing, all things considered (including the legal costs of protecting copyrights, would be to have the first-copy costs of publishing covered by grants from universities, not just universities that operate presses but (as the National Enquiry into Scholarly Communication recommended in its report way back in 1979) every college and university whose faculty participates in, and benefits from, the system of scholarly communication as it exists today, The effect, for presses, of operating on a grants model would be to lessen their economic reliance on copyright law which would remain important to authors, however, insofar a; The contrast between subsidized and market-based publishing, it needs to be remembered, is a contrast of ideal systems. In reality, the scholarly publishing system we have now, even where commercial publishers are involved, already depends on a significant degree of subsidy in the form of faculty time spent reviewing manuscripts, serving as editors or on editorial boards, etc, which is only partially, if at all, reimbursed, Many commercial publishers may compensate jour al editors: it is not a common practice in university press journal publishing, Full open access, though, will push the system as far as it can go to one extreme, whereas open access that is still compatible with market-generated revenue streams will be just one more step toward that end of the spectrum spanning completely market-based to completely free-to-end-user; For an analysis of the costs of publishing monographs, see Wasserman, M. 1998.

These facts are well known and provide the rationale for books published by university presses being generally given more weight in promotion and tenure decisions than those from commercial publishers, They would also be less likely to provide sizable subsidies to societie; Baldwin, C., (2004) What do societies do with their publishing surpluses?

CARMA would add the content of reviews to the public scientific record without compromising the anonymity of reviewers. The benefits to the relevant stakeholders are as follows: For readers, CARMA would reveal the actual impact of peer review on scholarly manuscripts; CARMA would encourage reviewers to provide thorough evaluations without jeopardizing their candor; Editors could utilize CARMA for quality assurance by soliciting ratings of reviews from their readership; For publishers, implementing CARMA would incur minimal costs, and could increase revenues. Whatever the present quality of peer review, making this process more transparent would be in the best interest of meritocratic scholars and society at large.",,,,,,,,,,,"Weller, A.C., (2001) Editorial Peer Review: Its Strengths and Weaknesses, , Medford, NJ, Information Today; Adam, D., Knight, J., Journals under pressure: Publish, and be damned (2002) Nature, 419, pp. 772-776. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/419772a; Daniel, H.D., Publications as a measure of scientific advancement and of scientists' productivity (2005) Learned Publishing, 18, pp. 143-148. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1087/0953151053584939; Gura, T., Scientific publishing: Peer review, unmasked (2002) Nature, 416, pp. 258-260. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/416258a; Jefferson, T., Shashok, K., Journals: How to decide what's worth publishing (2003) Nature, 421, pp. 209-210. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/421209b; Horrobin, D.F., The philosophical basis of peer review and the suppression of innovation (1990) Journal of the American Medical Association, 263, pp. 1438-1441. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1001/jama.263.10.1438; Chong, S., Normile, D., Stem cells: How young Korean researchers helped unearth a scandal (2006) Science, 311, pp. 22-25. , http://dx.doi.org/10. 1126/science.311.5757.22; Beasley, M.R., Datta, S., Kogelnik, H., Kroemer, H., Monroe, D., (2002) Report of the Investigation Committee on the Possibility of Scientific Misconduct in the Work of Hendrik Schön and Coauthors, , http://publish.aps.org/reports/lucentrep.pdf, Paris, Lucent Technologies, Available at; Couzin, J., Schirber, M., Fraud upends oral cancer field, casting doubt on prevention trial (2006) Science, 311, pp. 448-449. , http://dx.doi.org/10. 1126/science.311.5760.448a; Godlee, F., Making reviewers visible: Openness, accountability, and credit (2002) Journal of the American Medical Association, 287, pp. 2762-2765. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1001/jama.287.21.2762; Rennie, D., Freedom and responsibility in medical publication; setting the balance right (1998) Journal of the American Medical Association, 280, pp. 300-302. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1001/jama.280.3.300; Ingelfinger, F.J., Charity and peer review in publication (1975) New England Journal of Medicine, 293, pp. 1371-1372; Walsh, E., Rooney, M., Appleby, L., Wilkinson, G., Open peer review: A randomised controlled trial (2000) British Journal of Psychiatry, 176, pp. 47-51. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1192/bjp.176.1.47; Godlee, F., Gale, C.R., Martyn, C.N., Effect on the quality of peer review of blinding reviewers and asking them to sign their reports (1998) Journal of the American Medical Association, 280, pp. 237-240. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1001/jama.280.3.237; van Rooyen, S., Godlee, F., Evans, S., Smith, R., Black, N., Effect of blinding and unmasking on the quality of peer review: A randomized trial (1998) Journal of the American Medical Association, 280, pp. 234-237. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1001/jama.280.3.234; McNutt, R.A., Evans, A.T., Fletcher, R.H., Fletcher, S.W., The effects of blinding on the quality of peer review.

Advocates of such approaches are certain that these versions differ only trivially from the publishers' versions; many of those who oppose them are equally certain that there can be major discrepancies. In a pilot study, we have examined the actual differences in a small number of such article pairs in the social sciences and in biology. Using an operational classification of the extent of error, we have determined that neither pronouncement is likely to be correct. We found numerous small differences that affect readability; we also found a low frequency of potentially confusing errors, but sometimes it was the publisher's and sometimes the manuscript version that was more accurate. In two cases errors introduced by the publisher omit technical details that are necessary to evaluate the validity of the conclusions. However, we found no error that actually affected the validity of the data or results. Interestingly, we did find problems with the stability of the document locations on authors' sites, and, in some cases, with their disappearance from PubMed Central after initial placement there.",,,,,,,,,,,"Goodman, D., The criteria for open access (2004) Serials Review, 30, pp. 258-270. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.serrev.2004.09.009; Morgan, C.R., (2007) Errors in author's versions, , http://www.library.yale.edu/ ~llicense/ListArchives/0607/msg00256.html, accessed 16 Jan; PubMed Central.

Budget cuts, and subscription price increases due to resultant cancellations, have put additional strain on libraries, creating an accelerating spiral, the so-called 'serials crisis'. Personal subscriptions have suffered less from rising prices, but an increasing gap has opened up between personal and institutional subscription rates. This is being exploited by some unscrupulous agents, who are fraudulently buying journals at personal subscription rates and reselling them to libraries at discounted institutional rates, thus making huge profits and undermining the businesses of both the publishers and those agents who operate legitimately. Measures are being taken to counteract the problem, including the establishment by the Association of Subscription Agents and Intermediaries of a branch in the Middle East, where the problem is quite common, and the introduction of policy rules regarding personal subscriptions by the majority of STM publishers.",,,,,,,,,,,"Okerson, A., Stubbs, K., The library 'doomsday machine' (1991) Publishers Weekly, 8, pp. 36-37. , http://www.library.yale.edu/ ~okerson/doomsday.html, Available at; King, D.W., The cost of journal publishing: A literature review and commentary (2007) Learned Publishing, 20, pp. 85-106. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1087/ 174148507X183551; Tenopir, C and King, D.

But what is the role of publishers in this new environment? The key functions of publishing - organizing peer review, editorial support, graphic design, marketing, and distribution of academic information - do not just disappear; publishers still have a role here, but they need to take a more service-minded perspective. Academics still need to find ways to ensure the dissemination of their output; it is important that they realize that this will cost money, whether it is brought in-house or outsourced.

The examples demonstrate the impact of the levels of fixed and variable cost on the average cost per subscription, which is often the basis for subscription prices. Examples are also given to illustrate the effect of indirect costs on average costs per subscription, and the effect of the number of articles published on average costs. Then the implications of the examples on libraries and on the author-side payment model are examined. These hypothetical examples are followed by evidence in the literature of fixed costs, variable costs due to print reproduction and distribution, and indirect costs.

Recent announcements indicate that funding and evaluation bodies are becoming increasingly concerned that publicly funded research be made publicly available. The paper then reports a survey of all levels of academic staff plus research students at one Australian university, conducted in May 2006, prior to the introduction of an institutional repository. The survey, in line with previously reported surveys, found that while there was a high level of engagement with scholarly publishing, there was a low level of awareness of, or concern with, either open access ('green' or 'gold') or the roles repositories can play in increasing accessibility of research. Practically, this indicates that much work needs to be done within this university to increase knowledge of, and change behaviours with regard to, open access and repositories if the university and its academics are to make the most of new funding requirements and research evaluation processes.",,,,,,,,,,,"(2004) Pathfinder Research on Web-based Repositories, , http://www.palsgroup.org.uk, Mark Ware Consulting Ltd, Bristol, Publisher and Library/Learning Solutions PALS, Accessed 27 Sep 2006; available from; Accessibility Framework, , http://www.dest.gov.au/sectors/research_sector/policies_issues_reviews/ key_issues/accessibility_framework, Australian Government Department of Education Science and Training DEST, ND, accessed 4 Dec 2006; available from; ARROW Australian Repositories, , http://arrow.edu.au/about, Online to the World.

In this article, a proposed new system is discussed. The current title-based contract between publishers and libraries has caused a serious information gap, particularly in small institutes. In the new model, called the 'beneficiary-pays' model, sales are at the individual article level, and not that of the journal as a whole. In addition, the publication cost of poorly accessed articles is borne mainly by authors, whereas that of frequently used articles is paid mainly by readers. The feasibility of the new model is discussed. The two currently practised models, 'author-pays' and 'reader-pays', are compared with the 'bene/iciary-pays' model. It is doubtful if journals operating under the 'author-pays' open access model can ever acquire the reputation based on quality that is needed to motivate authors to pay high enough fees to finance the entire publication cost. The new variant of the user-pays model, in which libraries pay not for a subscription, but in proportion to the number of times the journal is accessed, is a fairer business model; however, the beneficiary-pays model is more sensitive to high-impact works.",,,,,,,,,,,"Ohta, T. and Hayashi, K. 2006.

This article examines that development, and looks at some of the arguments for and against the existence of copyright. It is argued that copyright is flexible enough to cope with the electronic world. The article examines the lessons learned from the past, and asks whether the Gowers Report helps or hinders. The author also raises the question 'what is the future of copyright?', given the intense interest not just of the UK government but also of the European Commission, which is determined to provide a 'level playing-field' across the countries of the EU. Lastly, the author examines the five main pressure points relevant to the future of copyright and asks who the publisher of the future will be.",,,,,,,,,,,"1 Ric. 3, c 9 1483; Born between 1415 and 1425 in Kent, he died in 1491; Statute of Anne, 1710 (8 Anne, c 19); Better known as 'Hogarth's Act'; The Copyright Act 1911 (1911) c 46; The Copyright Act 1956 (1956) c 74; The Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988 (1988) c 48; I know that I have left out, inter alia: The Copyright Act, 1814; The International Copyright Acts 1838 and 1844; The Copyright Act 1842; and the Foreign Reprints Act 1847, all of which were passed in an attempt to protect British publishers' (and authors') interests.

Information concerning such factors is in fact often not available. This paper argues for the establishment of methods for benchmarking scientific journals, taking into account a wider range of journal performance parameters than is currently available. A model for how prospective authors determine the value of submitting to a particular journal is presented. The model includes eight factors that influence an author's decision and 21 other underlying factors. The model is a qualitative one. The method proposes to benchmark groups of journals by application of the factors. Initial testing of the method has been undertaken in one discipline. © Bo-Christer Björk and Jonas Holmström 2006.",,,,,,,,,,,"Coupé, T., What do we know about ourselves?

Several factors are influential - particularly the Chinese government's policy of encouraging submission to foreign journals. Finance, management, and the academic degree policy are also obstacles.

This study looks at the self-archiving behaviour of authors publishing in leading journals in six social science disciplines. It tests the hypothesis that authors are self-archiving according to the norms of their respective disciplines rather than following self-archiving policies of publishers, and that, as a result, they are self-archiving significant numbers of publisher PDF versions.

This was followed by semi-structured interviews with six practitioners experienced in the set-up, management and maintenance of IRs, including representatives of three JISC FAIR projects. The aim was to identify the requirements of policy documentation provided by IRs. Although many issues were found to be handled differently, several common factors emerged. These included the importance of developing documentation in collaboration with academics, departments and senior management.

Scientists publishing on Nigerian biomedicine have written 6,820 articles in 295 journals/sources. Only eight of the 121 local journals that published biomedical research in Nigeria during the period were included in MEDLINE's listing (2.72%), while there were 32 (10.84%) regional and 255 (86.44%) external journals used.

Although the model treats both informal and formal communication, as well as the publishing of data, its focus is on modelling the publishing and indexing of traditional peer-reviewed journal articles, and finding and retrieving them.

Altogether, the views of nearly 4,000 authors were obtained and this paper concerns just those thousand or so authors who accepted the invitation to write freely about their own personal feelings and experiences. Using QSR N6 textual analysis software, their comments were processed and themes extracted. While the rest of the questionnaire, which was formed of closed-question, tick-box type questions, clearly must have had some impact on their thinking, the authors had considerable latitude in regard to what they could say. The paper provides a unique opportunity to hear their views directly.

The review of the research literature concludes that journal peer review is valid and does in fact function as a quality filter.

It has made it possible for researchers to provide open access (OA) (i.e. toll-free, full-text, online access, web-wide) to their peer-reviewed journal articles in two different ways: (i) by publishing in them in OA journals, and (ii) by publishing them in non-OA journals but also self-archiving them in their institutional OA archives. Librarians are researchers' best allies in both of these strategies. Examples of these strategies are described.

Awareness of open access journals among those who had not published in them was quite high; awareness of 'self-archiving' was less. For open access journal authors the most important reason for publishing in that way was the principle of free access; their main concerns were grants and impact. Authors who had not published in an open access journal attributed that to unfamiliarity with such journals. Forty per cent of authors have self-archived their traditional journal articles and almost twice as many say they would do so if required to.,,,,,,,,,,,"Swan, A., Brown, S., Authors and electronic publishing: What authors want from the new technology (2002) Learned Publishing, 16 (1), pp. 28-33. , www.ingentaselect.com/rpsv/catchword/alpsp/09531513/v16n1/s6/p28; Lawrence, S., Online or invisible?

By reviewing their role, it is possible to see how the changes from quantitative to qualitative assessment (and the resulting problems surrounding the definition of 'quality' journals) has impacted both on the journals selected by academics for publishing their research and the assessment of them. Although only one part of RAE submissions, the listing of published research outputs provides the primary evidence for research quality to most RAE panels, and is a significant driver of the final grade awarded, and thus the funding received by submitting institutions. The RAE, being a peer-reviewed assessment exercise, mirrors in some ways the peer-review process immured within scholarly publication. The developing role of journal publications as a vehicle for academic research output is examined via the chronology of the RAE, before assessing the current situation in which published journal output formed almost 70% of all output assessed by RAE panels in the latest exercise. The impact of this increased importance of academic journals in the assessment process is considered not only for academics but also for the wider community, i.e. publishers and libraries.",,,,,,,,,,,"(2001) Research Assessment Exercise 2001: Membership of Assessment Panels RAE 3/99, , http://www.hero.ac.uk/rae/Pubs/3_99/; Smith, L.N., An analysis and reflections on the quality of nursing research in 1992 (1994) Journal of Advanced Nursing, 19, p. 385; Watson, R., UKRAE 1996: Critique, comment and concern (1997) Journal of Advanced Nursing, 26 (4), pp. 641-642; Journal of Advanced Nursing, p. 642; Sayers, S., Who are my peers?

Results showed a divided opinion on the support of a society-published journal and no consideration of the benefits or harms of journal publishing to the society.

How relevant is content management to journal publishers? With over 150 competing content management products available in the UK, content and document management systems are not difficult to find (although perhaps difficult to choose). But do they meet a need? Do they provide a clear return on investment? Or are they simply the latest in a long line of management and business fads, the next big thing?

I reviewed the literature relating to this debate. Some commentators argue that professional writing assistance can inappropriately influence the reporting of research, undermine accountability for the published work, and deceive readers when the professional writer's contribution is not acknowledged. On the other hand, it has been argued that professional writers improve the quality and readability of papers, speed up the publication process, and undertake important educational activities. These arguments are based on anecdote and opinion rather than on evidence from well-conducted research. Although some recommendations have been proposed, there is no widely accepted published guidance about how writing assistance should be used. The biomedical community should consider implementing initiatives that will facilitate research about professional writing assistance - an outcome that would make for a better-informed debate. © Max Lagnado 2003.",,,,,,,,,,,"Sharp, D., A ghostly crew (1998) Lancet, 351, p. 1076; Rennie, D., Flanagin, A., Authorship! authorship! guests, ghosts, grafters, and the two-sided coin (1994) JAMA, 271, pp. 469-471; Larkin, M., Whose article is it anyway?

Currently, having a print version of journals is still more important to them than an electronic version. The issue of greatest importance to authors and readers is the continuing availability of back volumes, and there are strong concerns about pricing of electronic journals. The potential gains in publication speed through publishing electronically appear not to be a priority. Electronic preprint and reprint archives are used very little at present, with the exception of the physics and mathematics communities. Of all publisher-mediated tasks, the peer-review process is the most valued, followed by provision of citation-linking.

Most scientists in a discipline now use electronic journals at least part of the time, with considerable variations among disciplines. Evidence suggests that scientists are reading from a broader range of journals than in the past, influenced by timely electronic publishing and by growth in bibliographic searching and interpersonal communication as means of identifying and locating articles.

However, there is rapid evolution in scholarly communication. Usage is moving to electronic formats. In some areas, it appears that electronic versions of papers are being read about as often as the printed journal versions. Although there are serious difficulties in comparing figures from different media, the growth rates in usage of electronic scholarly information are sufficiently high that if they continue for a few years, there will be no doubt that print versions will be eclipsed. Further, much of the electronic information that is accessed is outside the formal scholarly publication process. There is also vigorous growth in forms of electronic communication that take advantage of the unique capabilities of the web, and which simply do not fit into the traditional journal publishing format. This paper presents some statistics on usage of print and electronic information. It also discusses some preliminary evidence about the changing patterns of usage. It appears that much of the online usage comes from new readers (esoteric research papers assigned in undergraduate classes, for example) and often from places that do not have access to print journals. Also, the reactions w even slight barriers to usage suggest that even high-quality scholarly papers are not irreplaceable. Readers are faced with a 'river of knowledge' that allows them to select among a multitude of sources, and to find near substitutes when necessary.

But reference links will only be used substantially if readers incorporate them into new patterns of habitual use. In doing so, many users will be in search mode and only some types of user will habitually use reference linking. There needs to be a sufficient number of references that are linked, the right processes to achieve that efficiently, and something that is worthwhile at the end of the link. Ideally users would get full text and some new business models are suggested that match what users do and the new technical possibilities.

The aim of this article is to examine briefly the current educational copying regime in Australia, looking at the licences entered into by the universities and the copyright owners, and comparing the way the new 2000 licensing agreement operates in contrast with the earlier licences. The impact of the recently enacted Copyright Amendment (Digital Agenda) Act 2000 is also examined in light of the new 2000 statutory licence and how these changes may impact upon current copying practices within Australian universities.",,,,,,,,,,,"(1976) Report of the Copyright Law Committee on Reprographic Reproduction, p. 10. , (Franki Committee Report) 1976 , AGPS Canberra; (1976) Report of the Copyright Law Committee on Reprographic Reproduction, p. 49. , (Franki Committee Report) 1976, AGPS Canberra, Recommendation 6.39; Copyright Act Amendment Act (Cth) 1983; note; Ricketson, S., (1999) The Law of Intellectual Property: Copyright, Designs and Confidential Information, 2nd edn., p. 3. , LBC Information Services; However, the licence was made effective from Dec. 1999; to be adjusted in accordance with the Consumer Price Index (CPI); By the Copyright Amendment Act 1989 (Cth); note; Section 135ZU Copyright Act 1968 (Cth); Approximately equal to one full time student enrolled in a course for one year (i.e. a student who is studying eight subjects or units); Section 40(2) of the Copyright Act; http://scaleplus.law.gov.au/; Sir Anthony, M., (1997) Reading the future, p. 51. , Australian Library and Information Association Library Week Oration, State Library of NSW, 2 Ent L.R 47; www.austlii.edu.au/; (2000) AVCC News Release, , www.avcc.edu.au/avcc/mediarel/2000/Avcc%20media%2004_001.htm, 7 Mar; note; http://search.aph.gov.au/; note; AVCC submission to Commonwealth's Digital Agenda Discussion, , www.dcita.gov.au; Mullarvey, J., (2000) AVCC News Release, , www.avcc.edu.au/avcc/mediarel/2000/Avcc%20media%2004_001.htm, the Deputy Executive Director.

This paper uses examples from biomedical journals to examine its shortcomings. Although mainly anecdotal, the evidence suggests that peer review is sometimes ineffective at identifying important research and even less effective at detecting fraud. Most reviewers identify only the minority of a paper's defects and they may be biased. Peer review plus other editorial processes are associated with improvements in papers between submission and publication, but published papers remain hard to read and a significant proportion contain errors or omissions. While it is hard to quantify the costs, peer review does not seem an efficient use of resources. Research into the outcomes of peer review, the establishment of sound methods for measuring the quality of the process and its outcomes, and comparisons with alternative methods are needed.",,,,,,,,,,,"ALPSP/EASE Peer Review Survey, , www.alpsp.org/peerev.pdf; Jefferson, T., Wager, E., Davidoff, F., Measuring the quality of editorial peer review (2001) 4th International Congress on Peer Review in Biomedical Publication, , Barcelona, Sep; Lock, S., The grossest failures of peer review (1993) BMJ, 307, p. 382; Godlee, E., Gale, C.R., Martyn, C.N., Effect on the quality of peer review of blinding reviewers and asking them to sign their reports: A randomized controlled trial (1998) JAMA, 280, pp. 237-240; Peters, D.P., Ceci, S.J., Peer-review practices of psychological journals: The fate of published articles, submitted again (1982) Behavioral and Brain Sciences, 5, pp. 187-195; Lock, S., (1991) A Difficult Balance: Editorial Peer Review in Medicine, , London: BMJ; Nylenna, M., Riis, P., Karlsson, Y., Multiple blinded reviews of the same two manuscripts: Effects of referee characteristics and publication language (1994) JAMA, 272, pp. 149-151; (1998) Office of Research Integrity Annual Report 1997, , Washington, DC: Department of Health and Human Services; (1999) Office of Research Integrity Annual Report 1998, , Washington, DC: Department of Health and Human Services; (2000) Office of Research Integrity Annual Report 1999, , Washington, DC: Department of Health and Human Services; Rennie, D., Misconduct and peer review (1999) Peer Review in Health Sciences, pp. 90-99. , F.

In trying to give an answer to this pressing question we do not deal with utopian libraries of the next century, but with the library and the librarian of the next decade. The emphasis is on libraries within educational and research institutions, especially university libraries. We examine the changes confronting the library of the future and identify four key aspects of the library of the future. It will be (i) a gateway to information, whatever format this information comes in and wherever it is located; (ii) an expertise centre; (iii) a physical entity, not only in the sense of being a social meeting place and place of scholarly interaction, but also as a place where students and other users are provided with modern study facilities and adequate user support; and (iv) a collection centre of printed material. Such libraries can only take on an appropriate shape and will only survive if the institutions that librarians serve in meet the four criteria outlined above.

Other issues addressed briefly include competition from commercial academic publishers, consolidation in the publishing industry, the rise in importance of the global market for university press books, and financial issues.",,,,,,,,,,,"Givler, P., Scholarly books, the coin of the realm of knowledge (1999) Chronicle of Higher Education, (12 NOV), pp. A76; Horowtz, I.L., (1991) Communicating Ideas: The Politics of Scholarly Publishing, pp. 97-131. , New Brunswick: Transaction Publishers; Orlans, H., Fair use in US scholarly publishing (1999) Learned Publishing, 12 (4), pp. 235-244. , Oct; Jeanneret, M., (1989) God and Mammon: Universities as Publishers, pp. 8-23. , Urbana: University of Illinois Press; Parsons, P., (1989) Getting Published: The Acquisition Process at University Presses, pp. 7-16. , Knoxville: University of Tennessee Press; Powell, W.W., (1985) Getting into Print: The Decision-making Process in Scholarly Publishing, pp. xv-xxxi. , Chicago: University of Chicago Press; (1999) The Association of American University Presses Directory 1999-2000, pp. 8-15. , New York: The Association of American University Presses; note; McCarthy, C.H., Wharton, R., Jurison, J., Greco, A.N., Methodology, definitions, and data sources (2000) Book Industry Trends 2000, , New York: Book Industry Study Group, Inc., 2000, 4-1 through 4.7; Greco, A.N., McCarthy, C.H., Forecasting methodology (1999) Book Industry Trends 1999, , New York: Book Industry Study Group, Inc., 4-7 through 4-20; Benninga, S., (1997) Financial Modeling, pp. 15-49. , Cambridge, MA: MIT Press; Biswas, T., (1997) Decision-making under Uncertainty, pp. 21-52. , London: Macmillan; McCarthy, C.H., Wharton, R., Jurison, J., Greco, A.N., Methodology, definitions, and data sources (2000) Book Industry Trends 2000, , New York: Book Industry Study Group, Inc., 4-1 through 4-2; (1999) The Statistical Abstract of the United States 1999, p. 495. , Washington, DC: USGPO; (2000) Book Industry Trends 2000, , Book Industry Study Group, Inc.

Ruiz Aznar 12, 2-A, 18008 Granada, Spain","I set out to describe the multifaceted role of author's editors in scientific-technical-medical (STM) information transfer. Help with manuscript preparation is only part of the picture; author's editors deal with many other formats for information transfer in addition to manuscripts that report original research. They may advise authors on publication ethics, peer review, and the publication process. They may work individually with authors, or as part of a writing and documentation team. They may act as the author's mentor and advocate when circumstances threaten authors' rights or dilute their responsibilities as communicators of science. Up to now author's editors have generally remained anonymous, but I conclude that recent developments in authorship policy may give more credit and public acknowledgement to the valuable part they play in the process of communicating scientific research. I also suggest that their close interaction with the producers, distributors, and consumers of STM information puts them in a prime position to contribute to research aimed at identifying and correcting deficiencies in current publication processes.",,,,,,,,,,,"(1994) Scientific Style and Format.

It suggests that editors should give equal attention to current opportunities to improve journals' operational efficiencies through full exploitation of desktop publishing in production and the reorganization of manuscript management (submissions, peer review, and author-editor interactions) as online processes.

Beginning in 2001, the Cooperative will begin to add further leading history journals with common aims and standards (4-5 journals in 2001, 5-7 in each subsequent year). The Cooperative plans to include both US and international history journals. In each case the Cooperative will produce an electronic edition of the journal, making it available to all subscribers. The Cooperative will archive a fully searchable backset of each journal's electronic edition, and the backsets will be cross-searchable. For further information, see 'frequently asked questions'; http://www.press.uillinois.edu/journals/lhr.html, The Law and History Review is published three times a year (spring, summer, and fall) by the University of Illinois Press for the American Society for Legal History.

Both ScholarOne and XpressTrack are hosted services - that is, the user-journal accesses its data in all fields (manuscripts received, reviewer and author communications, reviewer data bases, management records, etc.) by connecting to a central location to which the journal rents entry. For a different approach go to PaperPath, Inc. at http://www.paperpath.com/. Rather than access to a service, PaperPath sells journals modular dedicated editorial management software on a one-off basis for installation on their own hardware; Wood, D., Hurst, P., Online peer review: Perceptions in the biological sciences (2000) Learned Publishing, 13, pp. 95-100. , http://www.iop.org/, To view the Institute of Physics' journals management and subscription interface go to and choose 'Journals'. For discussion of the operation of another science-based approach, concentrating on online peer review; I base these comments on my own observation of fundamental alterations in the organization and management of public funding of scholarly research in Australia during the 1980s; PaperPath may be a different story. PaperPath software offers considerable flexibility in deployment, and hence start-up cost, allowing an individual journal fairly precise tailoring of software purchases to the particular management strategies it has formulated in light of its unique character. Deployment can begin at the level of a sole user. An interactive component can be added as additional software modules extend system access to multiple users on a local area network and thence to a wide area network using internet connectivity to create a 'virtual' editorial office. Further modules add online submission, peer review, and file-conversion components; Article files received in recent months by attachment have ranged in size from 100 to 550K; http://www.theaha.org/perspectives/issues/1998/9802/9802NEW.CFM, Collective discussion of the implications of electronic publication for history journals began in August 1997 in Bloomington, IN, at a conference of history editors sponsored jointly by the American Historical Association and the Organization of American Historians.

Fifty librarians (52.6%) answered the survey with one follow-up. The study found that over 70% of the libraries that returned the survey had participated in e-journal-related activities. Questions relating to 'access' were consistently ranked high in explaining why librarians in major academic libraries think e-journals are valuable, yet 'cost' seems to be a critical factor in determining e-journal adoption.

If one discounts the tendency of many people to prefer transmitting, and possibly embellishing, bad news rather than good, one is still left with the strong impression that serious ethical lapses can take place in the reviewing and editing processes. The most serious problems are very long delays - periods of two years are often experienced - before acceptances or rejections of manuscripts are made known. All too often, such a delay is coupled with the appearance of a publication on the same topic by a (suspected) later-starting rival. In several cases, authors have claimed proof that these rivals were reviewers of their papers. In some cases, the reviewer has even 'lifted' material from the submitted manuscript. This is a very difficult area for editors and publishers to police. A group of aggrieved authors in the US drew up a 'bill of rights' and negotiated, with some success, with the then-editor of Science for its acceptance.",,,,,,,,,,,"Swann, A., (1999) ""What Authors Want"": The ALPSP Research Study on the Motivations and Concerns of Contributors to Learned Journals, 21 (3), pp. 170-172. , http://alpsp.org.uk, Learned Publishing July","Wilson, D.G.; MIT, 77 Massachusetts Avenue, Cambridge, MA 02139, United States; email: dgwilson@mit.edu",,,Association of Learned and Professional Society Publ.,,,,,9531513,,,,English,Learn.

Three 'insights' are described, the first is into the 'means/end' confusion of much current net-based publishing activity, the second is that it is the purpose, not the form, that is the important aspect of the traditional academic journal model, and the third is that satisfactory net-based publishing models need not contain a central publisher. From this new viewpoint is developed the Deconstructed Journal (DJ) model which it is suggested is a better model for network based academic publishing. It also solves some of the problems of the current model.

Dialogue between publishers and librarians is essential to creating the sense of partnership and open-mindedness needed to meet the future needs of scholarship and research. Publishers and librarians have complementary roles and responsibilities, serving the same needs and facing similar challenges. The interests of publishers and librarians need to be rebalanced in order to seize the benefits of digital information flow. Legislation provides a framework of copyright, privacy, competition, and consumer law that protects against misuse while facilitating the flow of information from author to reader. If laws need to be amended, such changes should be made on the basis of the mutual agreement of all members of the community. There is much to be achieved without legislative change. Neither publishers nor librarians should shy away from the issues that divide them, especially the scope of fair use and the exchange of copyright information between libraries. A more detailed analysis of the impact of copyright exemptions is needed. The development of a predictable licensing environment and the testing of new business models requires co-operation between publishers and librarians, and leads to better mutual understanding. STM seeks dialogue with libraries and with other members of the research and scholarly communities in order to meet the challenges, opportunities, and expectations created by the digital environment.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Association of Learned and Professional Society Publ.,,,,,9531513,,,,English,Learn.

I will argue, based on 20 years editing Behavioral and Brain Sciences, a refereed (paper) journal of peer commentary, 8 years editing Psycoloquy, a refereed electronic journal of peer commentary, and 1 year of implementing CogPrints, an electronic archive of unrefereed preprints and refereed reprints in the cognitive sciences modeled on the Los Alamos Physics Eprint Archive, that (i) peer commentary is a supplement, not a substitute, for peer review, (ii) the authors of refereed papers, who get and seek no royalties from the sale of their texts, only want protection from theft of authorship on the Net, not from theft of text, which is a victimless crime, and hence (iii) the trade model (subscription, site license or pay-per-view) should be replaced by author page charges to cover the much reduced cost of implementing peer review, editing and archiving on the Net, in exchange for making the learned serial corpus available free for all forever. © ALPSP 1998.",,,,,,,,,,,"McLuhan, M., (1962) The Gutenberg Galaxy; the Making of Typographic Man, , Toronto: University of Toronto Press; Ginsparg, P., First steps towards electronic research communication (1994) Computers in Physics, 8 (4), pp. 390-396. , August, American Institute of Physics; Harnad, S., Post-Gutenberg Galaxy: The fourth revolution in the means of production of knowledge (1991) Public-Access Computer Systems Review, 2 (1), pp. 39-53; Harnad, S., The PostGutenberg Galaxy: How to get there from here (1995) Information Society, 11 (4), pp. 285-292; Harnad, S., Scholarly skywriting and the prepublication continuum of scientific inquiry (1990) Psychological Science, 1, pp. 342-343; Harnad, S., (1982) Peer Commentary on Peer Review: A Case Study in Scientific Quality Control, , New York: Cambridge University Press; Harnad, S., Learned inquiry and the Net: The role of peer review, peer commentary and copyright (1997) Antiquity, 71, pp. 1042-1048; Garfield, E., The multiple meanings of impact factors (1998) J.

These changes, include for example remote working and the increasingly powerful potential of 'outsourcing'. Looking at a publishing environment now populated mainly by very large and very small companies, the article suggests a symbiotic relationship between these giants and pygmies. It then looks at major characteristics of small publishers and how such companies can exploit the advantages of smallness to survive and succeed. The specific case of IP Publishing Ltd is used to illustrate some options for small publishers, including their opportunity to operate as 'virtual' companies. Finally, the article suggests that small companies can be useful to large corporations as indicators of change. © ALPSP 1998.",,,,,,,,,,,"Reed-Wolters merger: Competition problems in £20bn publishing merger (1998) Financial Times, 24. , February; Anyone working out there?

Nobody questions the importance of these roles but community creation is different and requires skills which are frequently closer to caterers or advertising agencies or hoteliers.

Structured abstracts (which use sub-headings like this one) have now become widespread in medical research journals. AIM. The aim of this paper is to consider whether or not such structured abstracts can be used effectively in social science journals. METHOD. The paper reviews a selection of studies of carried out by the author and his colleagues to see if structured abstracts written for social science journals are more informative, easier to read, and easier to search than are their traditional equivalents. RESULTS. The results suggest that structured abstracts do, indeed, have these virtues, and that they are thus appropriate for social science journals. CONCLUSION. The author therefore recommends that the editors of social science journals consider adopting structured abstracts.",,,,,,,,,,,"Taddio, A., Pain, T., Fassos, F.F., Quality of nonstructured and structured abstracts of original research articles in the British Medical Journal, the Canadian Medical Association Journal and the Journal of the American Medical Association (1994) Canadian Medical Association Journal, 150 (10), pp. 1611-1615; Haynes, R.B., More informative abstracts: Current status and evaluation (1993) Journal of Clinical Epidemiology, 46 (7), pp. 595-597; McIntosh, N., (1995) Structured Abstracts and Information Transfer, , R & D Report No. 6142.
