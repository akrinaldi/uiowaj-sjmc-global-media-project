A Simulation Study Using Data from 26 Countries,2020,Communication Methods and Measures,14,2,,125,144,,,10.1080/19312458.2020.1724274,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85079413537&doi=10.1080%2f19312458.2020.1724274&partnerID=40&md5=4a94b668b554d3c010c448561202e91e,"University of Hohenheim, Department of Communication, Stuttgart, Germany; Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz, Department of Communication, Mainz, Germany","Mangold, F., University of Hohenheim, Department of Communication, Stuttgart, Germany; Scharkow, M., Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz, Department of Communication, Mainz, Germany","Although communication scholars have increasingly studied audience fragmentation by analyzing audience networks, recent cross-national research has spurred a methodological debate about how to construct these audience networks from media use data. One point of contention lies in the choice of filtering procedures that only keep meaningful ties, where the traditional deviation-from-random-duplication filter has been replaced by alternatives such as backbone extraction. Using survey data from the 2016 Reuters Institute Digital News Report on news usage in 26 countries, we examined how filtering choices impact the structures of audience networks through a resampling simulation experiment. The simulation revealed a strong divergence between the filtering approaches, which invited disparate interpretations regarding the fragmentation of modern news audiences. The backbone extraction approach produced the most distinct results, while dealing most effectively with randomness in the media use data. As the filtering approaches mapped the structural features of audiences to different values of the same network metrics, the findings imply that studies diverging in these analytical decisions do not produce compatible results. © 2020, © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Bates, D., Mächler, M., Bolker, B., Walker, S., Fitting linear mixed-effects models using lme4 (2015) Journal of Statistical Software, 67 (1), pp. 1-48; Borge-Holthoefer, J., González-Bailón, S., Scale, time and activity patterns: Advanced methods for the analysis of online networks (2017) Handbook of online research methods, pp. 259-275. , Fielding N., Lee R., Blank G., (eds), London, UK: Sage, &,.

The brain acts as both the sender and receiver of messages and underpins our fundamental ability to communicate and interact with others. Communication scholars can, therefore, study the brain to gain a more complete understanding of communication phenomena. Our goal with the present manuscript is to promote neuroscience research to communication scholars in the following ways: (1) We provide rationale for studying communication from a neural perspective. (2) We delineate the various advantages and challenges that neuroscience methods present. (3) We describe three distinct methodological entry points for communication scholars to approach the field. Specifically, we illustrate how neuroscience measures can be incorporated into communication research as dependent variables, mediators, or predictors. We then close with a forward-looking perspective on future developments in measurement, analysis, and theory, which we expect will have a profound influence on communication science. © 2020, © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,"We thank Maral Zakharia for creating the graphical illustrations, Kjerstin Thorson for providing helpful feedback on an earlier version of the manuscript, and three anonymous reviewers for their helpful feedback and discussion.",,"Adolphs, R., The social brain: Neural basis of social knowledge (2009) Annual Review of Psychology, 60, pp. 693-716; Alcalá-López, D., Smallwood, J., Jefferies, E., Van Overwalle, F., Vogeley, K., Mars, R.B., Bzdok, D., Computing the social brain connectome across systems and states (2017) Cerebral Cortex, , 28, (7), 2207–2232; Ariely, D., Berns, G.S., Neuromarketing: The hope and hype of neuroimaging in business (2010) Nature Reviews Neuroscience, 11 (4), pp. 284-292; Baars, N., Gage, B., (2012) Fundamentals of cognitive neuroscience, , New York, NY: Academic Press; Babiloni, F., Astolfi, L., Social neuroscience and hyperscanning techniques: Past, present and future (2014) Neuroscience and Biobehavioral Reviews, 44, pp. 76-93; Baek, E.C., Scholz, C., O’Donnell, M.B., Falk, E.B., The value of sharing information: A neural account of information transmission (2017) Psychological Science, 28 (7), pp. 851-861; Barabási, A.-L., The network takeover (2012) Nature Physics, 8, pp. 14-16; Baron, R.M., Kenny, D.A., The moderator-mediator variable distinction in social psychological research: Conceptual, strategic and statistical considerations (1986) Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 51, pp. 1173-1182; Bartels, A., Zeki, S., The neural basis of romantic love (2000) Neuroreport, 11 (17), pp. 3829-3834; Bassett, D.S., Sporns, O., Network neuroscience (2017) Nature Neuroscience, 20 (3), pp. 353-364; Bassett, D.S., Yang, M., Wymbs, N.F., Grafton, S.T., Learning-induced autonomy of sensorimotor systems (2015) Nature Neuroscience, 18 (5), pp. 744-751; Bechtel, W., Mechanisms in cognitive psychology: What are the operations?

Unfortunately, for a variety of reasons, the process by which our research is conducted is not always clear in journal articles or books reporting our research. This lack of process-insight (a) limits our ability to build on each other’s research, (b) limits our holistic understanding of communication processes, and (c) limits the ability of consumers of our research to put it into practice. The current article discusses recent methodological advances designed to address these issues–advances in open science practices. I provide a brief primer on the philosophy behind open science and its relevance for communication research, then provide recommendations for both novice and expert researchers to implement open science practices at multiple steps of the research pipeline. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,"I thank Malte Elson, Nicholas Michalak, Christopher Skurka, and an anonymous reviewer for their helpful comments on an earlier draft of this manuscript.",,"Arslan, R.C., How to automatically document data with the codebook package to facilitate data re-use (2009) Advances in Methods and Practices in Psychological Science, 2(2), 169–187; Arslan, R.C., (2018) Cook codebooks from survey metadata encoded in attributes in R; Baker, M., Dolgin, E., Cancer reproducibility project releases first results (2017) Nature News, 541 (7637), p. 269; Bayer, J.B., Ellison, N., Schoenebeck, S., Brady, E., Falk, E.B., Facebook in context(s): Measuring emotional responses across time and space (2018) New Media & Society, 20, pp. 1047-1067; Bonus, J.A., Mares, M.L., When the sun sings science, are children left in the dark?

We compare a range of off-the-shelf sentiment analysis tools to manually coded economic news as well as examine the agreement between these dictionary approaches themselves. We assess the performance of five off-the-shelf sentiment analysis tools and two tailor-made dictionary-based approaches. The analyses result in five conclusions. First, there is little overlap between the off-the-shelf tools; causing wide divergence in terms of tone measurement. Second, there is no stronger overlap with manual coding for short texts (i.e., headlines) than for long texts (i.e., full articles). Third, an approach that combines individual dictionaries achieves a comparably good performance. Fourth, precision may increase to acceptable levels at higher levels of granularity. Fifth, performance of dictionary approaches depends more on the number of relevant keywords in the dictionary than on the number of valenced words as such; a small tailor-made lexicon was not inferior to large established dictionaries. Altogether, we conclude that off-the-shelf sentiment analysis tools are mostly unreliable and unsuitable for research purposes–at least in the context of Dutch economic news–and manual validation for the specific language, domain, and genre of the research project at hand is always warranted. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

On the one hand, this opens up a new field for media and communication research. On the other hand, the widespread diffusion allows for integrating mobile devices into our methodological toolkit. Researchers across the globe have creatively started to take advantage of these new opportunities in the past years. One area of development is building upon the tradition of repeated self-report measurements like “Experience Sampling Method”, “Ecological Momentary Assessment”, “Diary Method”, or “Real-Time Response Measurement”. In order to map the advances in this area, we conducted a scoping review based on English academic peer-reviewed articles. Findings suggest that terminology and methodological standards are still blurred, and standardization is needed in order to further the methodological discussion on mobile self-report data collection methods in repeated measurement designs. Based on the results of our scoping review, we propose a typology as well as reporting standards and discuss data analytical challenges. © 2020, © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"(2017) Ethical principles of psychologists and code of conduct, , https://www.apa.org website: https://www.apa.org/ethics/code/index, Retrieved October 27, 2019, from; Arksey, H., O’Malley, L., Scoping studies: Towards a methodological framework (2005) International Journal of Social Research Methodology, 8 (1), pp. 19-32. , https://doi.org/10.1080/1364557032000119616; Bayer, J., Ellison, N., Schoenebeck, S., Brady, E., Falk, E.B., Facebook in context(s): Measuring emotional responses across time and space (2018) New Media & Society, 20 (3), pp. 1047-1067. , https://doi.org/10.1177/1461444816681522; Bayer, J.B., Ellison, N.B., Schoenebeck, S.Y., Falk, E.B., Sharing the small moments: Ephemeral social interaction on Snapchat (2016) Information, Communication & Society, 19 (7), pp. 956-977. , https://doi.org/10.1080/1369118X.2015.1084349; Beal, D.J., ESM 2.0: State of the art and future potential of experience sampling methods in organizational research (2015) Annual Review of Organizational Psychology and Organizational Behavior, 2 (1), pp. 383-407. , https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-orgpsych-032414-111335; Biocca, F., David, P., West, M., Continuous response measurement (CRM): A computerized tool for research on the cognitive processing of communication messages (1994) Communication series.

However, methodological studies that focus on such communication dynamics are rare. In this paper, we present a model that tackles two statistical challenges of interrelated communication dynamics: (1) measuring the reciprocal relationship between communication processes and associated outcomes in distinct sequences and (2) the disaggregation of intraindividual and interindividual effects. To do so, we rely on latent growth models using structural equation modeling and extend them with a piecewise/spline regression approach. We refer to the combined model as the Sequential Latent Growth Model with Structured Residuals (SLGM-SR). Focusing on political communication as well as media effects and selection research, we present an empirical illustration and a modeling strategy by applying the model to short-term campaign panel data collected during the German federal elections in 2013. Further, we discuss (dis)-advantages of the sequential approach in the context of communication dynamics. © 2020, © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Bainter, S.A., Howard, A.L., Comparing within-person effects from multivariate longitudinal models (2016) Developmental Psychology, , https://doi.org/10.1037/dev0000215, 52, (12), 1955-1968; Baumgartner, F., Jones, B.D., (2009) Agendas and instability in American politics, , University of Chicago Press; Baumgartner, S.E., van der Schuur, W.A., Lemmens, J.S., Te Poel, F., The relationship between media multitasking and attention problems in adolescents: Results of two longitudinal studies (2018) Human Communication Research, , https://doi.10.1111/hcre.12111, 44, (1), 3–30; Berry, D., Willoughby, M.T., On the practical interpretability of cross-lagged panel models: Rethinking a developmental workhorse (2017) Child Development, 88 (4), pp. 1186-1206. , https://doi.org/10.1111/cdev.12660; Bollen, K.A., Curran, P.J., Autoregressive latent trajectory (ALT) models.

Such models allow individual aspects of human interaction to be isolated and controlled in a way that sheds new insight into complex behavioral phenomena. This approach is particularly valuable in settings beset by confounding factors and mixed empirical evidence. The political communication setting of deliberation is one such salient setting: in business, politics, and everyday life, individuals with varying opinions, experience, and information attempt to collaborate and make decisions. Empirical evidence suggests that such collaborative reasoning can lead to good decisions, yet there are numerous deliberative failures which may frequently cause groups to reach bad outcomes. Using the substantive setting of deliberation, this paper presents an agent-based model aimed at disambiguating the individual factors which influence decision-making conversations. We model this communicative process as a deliberative game of “giving and asking for reasons.” Agents share beliefs around possible policy initiatives and attempt to enact “good” policies through a process of mutual exchange and consideration. The model considers an interconnected policy landscape in which implementing or not implementing a policy mediates the value of other policies. Within this framework, the paper considers the impacts of three canonical failures of deliberation: limited cognitive capacity, group factions, and tendencies to make poor judgments when accepting or rejecting others’ views. We find that cognitive capacity can significantly decrease the ability of a group to reach a good decision. However, this effect appears to be mitigated for groups of opposing factions. Indeed, polarized groups do surprisingly well at identifying optimal policy solutions, suggesting that heterogeneous agents can achieve good outcomes if they are willing to talk and learn from each other. © 2020, © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Altafini, C., Consensus problems on networks with antagonistic interactions (2013) IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control, 58 (4), pp. 935-946. , https://doi.org/10.1109/TAC.2012.2224251; Choi, T., Robertson, P.J., Deliberation and decision in collaborative governance: A simulation of approaches to mitigate power imbalance (2013) Journal of Public Administration Research and Theory, 58 (4), pp. 495-518. , https://doi.org/10.1093/jopart/mut003; DeGroot, M.H., Reaching a consensus (1974) Journal of the American Statistical Association, 69 (345), pp. 118-121. , https://doi.org/10.1080/01621459.1974.10480137; Dworkin, R., (2006) Is democracy possible here?: Principles for a new political debate, , Princeton University Press; Eliasoph, N., (1998) Avoiding politics: How Americans produce apathy in everyday life, , Cambridge University Press; Evans, J.S.B., In two minds: Dual-process accounts of reasoning (2003) Trends in Cognitive Sciences, 7 (10), pp. 454-459. , https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tics.2003.08.012; Festinger, L., A theory of social comparison processes (1954) Human Relations, 7 (2), pp. 117-140. , https://doi.org/10.1177/001872675400700202; Fishkin, J., (2014) Reviving deliberative democracy, , In J.

Previous studies suggest that simple learning algorithms based on local interactions, such as reinforcement learning, sufficiently give rise to signaling systems in decentralized populations. However, those algorithms often fail to achieve optimal signaling systems. Under what condition do suboptimal signaling systems emerge? To address this question, we propose a multi-agent model of signaling games with three parameters–memory length, the complexity of communication problems, and population size–as potential constraints imposed on the collective learning process. The results from numerical experiments suggest that finite memory leads to suboptimal signaling systems, characterized by redundant signal-meaning associations. This paper concludes with discussions on the theoretical implications of the findings and the directions of future research. © 2020, © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Abrams, D.M., Strogatz, S.H., Linguistics: Modelling the dynamics of language death (2003) Nature, 424 (6951), p. 900. , https://doi.org/10.1038/424900a; Alpaydin, E., (2016) Machine learning: The new AI, , MIT Press; Argiento, R., Pemantle, R., Skyrms, B., Volkov, S., Learning to signal: Analysis of a micro-level reinforcement model (2009) Stochastic Processes and Their Applications, 119 (2), pp. 373-390. , https://doi.org/10.1016/j.spa.2008.02.014; Ashlock, D., (2006) Evolutionary computation for modeling and optimization, , Springer; Barrett, J.A., The evolution of coding in signaling games (2009) Theory and Decision, 67 (2), pp. 223-237. , https://doi.org/10.1007/s11238-007-9064-0; Beggs, A.W., On the convergence of reinforcement learning (2005) Journal of Economic Theory, 122 (1), pp. 1-36. , https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jet.2004.03.008; Bjedov, T., Madiès, T., Villeval, M.C., Communication and coordination in a two-stage game (2016) Economic Inquiry, 54 (3), pp. 1519-1540. , https://doi.org/10.1111/ecin.12325; Blume, A., Coordination and learning with a partial language (2000) Journal of Economic Theory, 95 (1), pp. 1-36. , https://doi.org/10.1006/jeth.2000.2674; Bond, C.F., Robinson, M., The evolution of deception (1988) Journal of Nonverbal Behavior, 12 (4), pp. 295-307. , https://doi.org/10.1007/BF00987597; Boyd, R., Richerson, P.J., (2005) The origin and evolution of cultures, , Oxford University Press; Bruner, J., O’Connor, C., Rubin, H., Huttegger, S.M., David Lewis in the lab: Experimental results on the emergence of meaning (2018) Synthese, 195 (2), pp. 603-621. , https://doi.org/10.1007/s11229-014-0535-x; Caridi, I., Nemiña, F., Pinasco, J.P., Schiaffino, P., Schelling-voter model: An application to language competition (2013) Chaos, Solitons, and Fractals, 56, pp. 216-221. , https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chaos.2013.08.013; Cooper, R., (1999) Coordination games: Complementarities and macroeconomics, , Cambridge University Press; Cressman, R., (2003) Evolutionary dynamics and extensive form games, , MIT Press; Dassiou, X., Glycopantis, D., A tree formulation for signaling games (2013) Game Theory, 2013, pp. 1-12. , https://doi.org/10.1155/2013/754398; Demichelis, S., Weibull, J.W., Language, meaning, and games: A model of communication, coordination, and evolution (2008) The American Economic Review, 98 (4), pp. 1292-1311. , https://doi.org/10.2307/29730123; Franke, M., The evolution of compositionality in signaling games (2016) Journal of Logic, Language and Information, 25 (3-4), pp. 355-377. , https://doi.org/10.1007/s10849-015-9232-5; Franke, M., Correia, J.P., Vagueness and imprecise imitation in signalling games (2018) The British Journal for the Philosophy of Science, 69 (4), pp. 1037-1067. , https://doi.org/10.1093/bjps/axx002; Franke, M., Wagner, E.O., Game theory and the evolution of meaning (2014) Language and Linguistics Compass, 8 (9), pp. 359-372. , https://doi.org/10.1111/lnc3.12086; Gianetto, D.A., Heydari, B., Network modularity is essential for evolution of cooperation under uncertainty (2015) Scientific Reports, 5 (1), p. 9340. , https://doi.org/10.1038/srep09340; Harsanyi, J., Selten, R., (1988) A general theory of equilibrium selection in games, , MIT Press; Hawkins, R.X.D., Goodman, N.D., Goldstone, R.L., The emergence of social norms and conventions (2019) Trends in Cognitive Sciences, 23 (2), pp. 158-169. , https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tics.2018.11.003; Heinsalu, E., Patriarca, M., Léonard, J.L., The role of bilinguals in language competition (2014) Advances in Complex Systems, 17 (1), p. 1450003. , https://doi.org/10.1142/S0219525914500039; Hofbauer, J., Huttegger, S.M., Feasibility of communication in binary signaling games (2008) Journal of Theoretical Biology, 254 (4), pp. 843-849. , https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtbi.2008.07.010; Holdcroft, D., (1991) Saussure: Signs, system, and arbitrariness, , Cambridge University Press; Huttegger, S.M., Evolution and the explanation of meaning (2007) Philosophy of Science, 74 (1), pp. 1-27. , https://doi.org/10.1086/519477; Huttegger, S.M., Robustness in signaling games (2007) Philosophy of Science, 74 (5), pp. 839-847. , https://doi.org/10.1086/525625; Huttegger, S.M., How much rationality do we need to explain conventions?

Recognition scales are then calculated by summing the correct responses to both the true items and foils, or by summing the correct responses to the true items only. We used a sequence of psychometric analyses, including factor analysis and item response theory (IRT) analysis, to evaluate two recognition measures of this type, using data from previously published studies. We found that foils are less associated with true items than true items are with one another, or more practically, that foils are less associated with the underlying dimension of interest.

However, surprisingly little is known about the related social dynamics and their consequences for media use and social relations. This study addresses this topic based on co-orientation theory and investigates the social dynamics of TV and YouTube use among adolescents. A three-wave panel survey among 336 pupils enables us to disentangle which effect the friendship network has on individual media use (RQ1) and which effect media use has on the development and maintenance of friendship ties (RQ2). Based on a multi-level approach of dynamic social network analysis and applying stochastic actor-oriented modeling, we find empirical evidence for processes of social influence regarding TV programs and YouTube channels. No support is found for the hypothesized social selection processes. Along with these empirical insights, the research design demonstrates how the micro-level of individual behavior can be linked with the meso-level of social groups. Furthermore, the insights can be used as a basis to understand larger-scale phenomena emerging on the macro-level of societies and media markets such as audience fragmentation and long-tail audience distributions across media contents. © 2020, © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Block, P., Reciprocity, transitivity, and the mysterious three-cycle (2015) Social Networks, 40, pp. 163-173. , https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socnet.2014.10.005; Blumler, J.G., Katz, E., (1974) The uses of mass communications.

Yet methodologists have warned that α is not an optimal measure of reliability relative to its more general form, McDonald’s omega (ω). Among other reasons, that the computation of ω is not available as an option in many popular statistics programs and requires items loadings from a confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) have probably hindered more widespread adoption. After a bit of discussion of α versus ω, we illustrate the computation of ω using two structural equation modeling programs (Mplus and AMOS) and the MBESS package for R. We then describe a macro for SPSS and SAS (OMEGA) that calculates ω in two ways without relying on the estimation of loadings or error variances using CFA. We show that it produces estimates of ω that are nearly identical to when using CFA-based estimates of item loadings and error variances. We also discuss the use of the OMEGA macro for certain forms of item analysis and brief form construction based on the removal of items from a longer scale. © 2020, © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Becker, L.B., Vlad, T., Nusser, N., An evaluation of press freedom indicators (2007) The International Communication Gazette, 69, pp. 5-28; Cacioppo, J.T., Petty, R.E., Kao, C.F., The efficient assessment of need for cognition (1984) Journal of Personality Assessment, 48, pp. 306-307; Cheek, J.M., Buss, A.H., Shyness and sociability (1981) Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 41, pp. 330-339; Cortina, J.M., What is coefficient alpha?

Numerous studies have created websites as stimuli, asked experimental subjects to browse the website, then inferred that their behavior in the experimental context resembles their behavior in a natural setting. The external validity of these studies, or the degree to which online behavior in an experiment can generalize outside of the experiment, remains unclear. This study explores the external validity of two such online experiments by comparing the results to field tests. Across two different experiments on a major Canadian and a major U.S. news website redesign, we find that results from the online experiment offered data that were directionally the same as the field tests. Our results suggest that online experiments can offer a generally reliable picture of actual online behavior. © 2020, © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Alvarez, G.A., Cavanagh, P., The capacity of visual short-term memory is set both by visual information load and by number of objects (2004) Psychological Science, 15, pp. 106-111; Arceneaux, K., Johnson, M., (2013) Changing minds or changing channels?: Partisan news in an age of choice, , Chicago, IL: University of Chicago Press; Berinsky, A.J., Huber, G.A., Lenz, G.S., Evaluating online labor markets for experimental research: Amazon.com’s Mechanical Turk (2012) Political Analysis, 20, pp. 351-368; Boczkowski, P.J., Mitchelstein, E., (2013) The news gap: When the information preferences of the media and the public diverge, , Cambridge, MA: MIT Press; Boczkowski, P.J., Mitchelstein, E., Walter, M., Convergence across divergence: Understanding the gap in the online news choices of journalists and consumers in Western Europe and Latin America (2011) Communication Research, 38, pp. 376-396; Clay, R., Barber, J.M., Shook, N.J., Techniques for measuring selective exposure: A critical review (2013) Communication Methods and Measures, 7, pp. 147-171; Cook, T.D., Campbell, D.T., Shadish, W., (2002) Experimental and quasi-experimental designs for generalized causal inference, , Boston, MA: Houghton Mifflin; Coppock, A., Leeper, T.J., Mullinix, K.J., Generalizability of heterogeneous treatment effect estimates across samples (2018) Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 115, pp. 12441-12446; Fitzsimons, G.M., Chartrand, T.L., Fitzsimons, G.J., Automatic effects of brand exposure on motivated behavior: How Apple makes you “think different” (2008) Journal of Consumer Research, 35, pp. 21-35; Guala, F., Experimental localism and external validity (2003) Philosophy of Science, 70, pp. 1195-1205; Hastall, M.R., Knobloch-Westerwick, S., Caught in the act: Measuring selective exposure to experimental online stimuli (2013) Communication Methods and Measures, 7, pp. 94-105; Horton, J.J., Rand, D.G., Zeckhauser, R.J., The online laboratory: Conducting experiments in a real labor market (2011) Experimental Economics, 14, pp. 399-425; Huff, C., Tingley, D., “Who are these people?” Evaluating the demographic characteristics and political preferences of MTurk survey respondents (2015) Research & Politics, 2 (3), pp. 1-12; Knobloch-Westerwick, S., Johnson, B.K., Silver, N.A., Westerwick, A., Science exemplars in the eye of the beholder: How exposure to online science information affects attitudes (2015) Science Communication, 37, pp. 575-601; Knobloch-Westerwick, S., Lavis, S.M., Selecting serious or satirical, supporting or stirring news?

It shows, (i) what types of geographic information exist in social media data and to what extent they are available to researchers, (ii) which approaches exist to classify locations and (iii) what the advantages and disadvantages of the various approaches are. Introducing an approach to automatically classify location information based on the location information in users’ profiles and a multi-step cross-validation with time zone information, we show that the less resource-intensive approach yields high precision comparable to the “gold standard” of human coding while recall is comparatively low.

For Step 1, two humans coded a sub-sample of online forum posts for relational uncertainty. For Step 2, we evaluated reliability, in which we trained three different classifiers to learn from those subjective human interpretations. Reliability was established when two different metrics of inter-coder reliability could not distinguish whether a human or a machine coded the text on a separate hold-out set. Finally, in Step 3 we assessed validity. To accomplish this, we administered a survey in which participants described their own relational uncertainty/certainty via text and completed a questionnaire. After classifying the text, the machine’s classifications of the participants’ text positively correlated with the subjects’ own self-reported relational uncertainty and relational satisfaction. We discuss our results in line with areas of computational communication science, content analysis, and interpersonal communication. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Blei, D.M., Ng, A.Y., Jordan, M.I., Lafferty, J., Latent dirichlet allocation (2003) Journal of Machine Learning Research, 3 (4-5), pp. 993-1022; Bonito, J.A., Shared cognition and participation in small groups: Similarity of member prototypes (2004) Communication Research, 31 (6), pp. 704-730; Bonito, J.A., Keyton, J., Introduction to machine learning (2018) The Cambridge handbook of group interaction analysis, pp. 387-404. , Brauner E., Boos M., Kolbe M., (eds), Cambridge, United Kingdom: Cambridge University Press, &,.

At the heart of the debate on framing is the question of operationalizing and measuring emphasis frames. We harness novel computational tools to propose a new method for inductive identification of frames. We argue and demonstrate that frame elements could be identified using topic modeling, and that frame elements can then be automatically grouped into frame “packages” using community detection techniques applied to the topic network. Building upon recent conceptual and methodological developments in framing research, we introduce a new approach, the Analysis of Topic Model Networks (ANTMN). We demonstrate the applicability of our method in case studies where framing theory is developed and fairly consistent, and in exploratory ones where it is not, using three diverse U.S. news corpora: the coverage of political candidates in Senate races (n = 8,337 articles), foreign nations (n = 18,216), and infectious diseases and epidemics (n = 5,005). We conclude by discussing the theoretical, methodological, and practical implications of ANTMN. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Aalberg, T., Strömbäck, J., De Vreese, C.H., The framing of politics as strategy and game: A review of concepts, operationalizations and key findings (2011) Journalism, 13, pp. 162-178; An, S.-K., Gower, K.K., How do the news media frame crises?

This paper promotes such integration by highlighting niche for computational research within communication–the specialized roles it can play in symbiosis with researchers using other methods in the field. This paper articulates this niche via the computational communication researcher’s specific comparative advantages for testing existing communication theory and generating novel communication theoretic ideas. It then proposes four recommendations for performing and evaluating computational communication research to facilitate meeting these objectives. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,"International Communication Association, ICA",The author would like to thank Jeff Niederdeppe and the anonymous ICA reviewers for helpful feedback on this manuscript.,,"Amaya, A., Presser, S., Nonresponse bias for univariate and multivariate estimates of social activities and roles (2016) Public Opinion Quarterly, 81 (1), pp. 1-36; Anderson, C., The end of theory (2008) Wired Magazine, 16 (7), pp. 16-17; Barberá, P., Rivero, G., Understanding the political representativeness of Twitter users (2015) Social Science Computer Review, 33 (6), pp. 712-729; Boyd, D., Crawford, K., Critical questions for big data: Provocations for a cultural, technological, and scholarly phenomenon (2012) Information, Communication & Society, 15 (5), pp. 662-679; Beit-Hallahmi, B., Method and matter in the social sciences: Umbilically tied to the enlightenment (2015) Behavioral and Brain Sciences, 38, p. 58; Bessi, A., Coletto, M., Davidescu, G.A., Scala, A., Caldarelli, G., Quattrociocchi, W., Science vs conspiracy: Collective narratives in the age of misinformation (2015) PLoS One, 10 (2); Bollen, K., (1989) Structural equations with latent variables, , New York, NY: John Wiley; Bourdieu, P., (2000) Pascalian meditations, , Stanford University Press,.

Social algorithms, guided by a socio-technological codependency, often bias communication, usually in pursuit of some third-party goal of commercial or political nature. We propose a method to derive several summary measures to tests for transformational accuracy when transforming input into an output. Since dynamical flexibility of social algorithms prevents anticipating their behavior, we study these black boxes as if we study human behavior, through controlled experiments. We conceptualize them as noisy communication channels and evaluate their throughput with the same information theoretic measures engineers had originally used to minimize communicative distortion (i.e., mutual information). We use repeated experiments to reverse-engineer algorithmic behavior and test for its statistical significance. We apply the method to three artificial intelligence algorithms: a neural net from IBM’s Watson, and to the recommender engines of YouTube and Twitter. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Bakshy, E., Messing, S., Adamic, L.A., Exposure to ideologically diverse news and opinion on Facebook (2015) Science, 348 (6239), pp. 1130-1132; Bény, C., Deep learning and the renormalization group (2013) ArXiv:1301.3124 [Quant-Ph, , http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.3124, Retrieved from; Berrou, C., Glavieux, A., Thitimajshima, P., Near Shannon limit error-correcting coding and decoding: Turbo-codes. 1 (1993) Technical Program, Conference Record, IEEE International Conference on Communications, 1993.

Perceptions may be accurate, inaccurate, or respondents may offer no perceptions to evaluate for accuracy due to uncertainty. We re-analyze data from several published studies to evaluate whether different treatments of “don’t know” (DK) and similar ambiguous responses matters when evaluating accuracy levels. It does, sometimes leading to dramatically altered conclusions regarding accuracy. We also reanalyze recent data to evaluate the individual and group-level factors (with an emphasis on communication and homophily) that lead to such DK responses, and consider the implications of the treatment of DK responses for inferences about the role of communication in producing truly accurate perceptions. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Berger, C.R., Calabrese, R.J., Some explorations in initial interaction and beyond: Toward a developmental theory of interpersonal communication (1975) Human Communication Research, 1, pp. 99-112; Cowan, S.K., Baldassarri, D., “It could turn ugly”: Selective disclosure of attitudes in political discussion networks (2018) Social Networks, 52, pp. 1-17; Eveland, W.P., Jr., Hutchens, M.J., The role of conversation in developing accurate political perceptions: A multilevel social network approach (2013) Human Communication Research, 39, pp. 422-444; Goel, S., Mason, W., Watts, D.J., Real and perceived attitude agreement in social networks (2010) Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 99, pp. 611-621; Huckfeldt, R., Johnson, P., Sprague, J., (2004) Political disagreement: The survival of diverse opinions within communication networks, , New York, NY: Cambridge University Press; Huckfeldt, R., Sprague, J., (1995) Citizens, politics and social communication: Information and influence in an election campaign, , New York, NY: Cambridge University Press; Huckfeldt, R., Sprague, J., (2006) Presidential election campaign study, 1984: [South Bend, Indiana, , Ann Arbor, MI: Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research [distributor], 2006-01-12; Huckfeldt, R., Sprague, J., (2007) Indianapolis-St. Louis election study, 1996–1997, , Ann Arbor, MI: Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research [distributor]; Levitan, L.C., Visser, P.S., Social network composition and attitude strength: Exploring the dynamics within newly formed social networks (2009) Journal of Experimental Social Psychology, 45, pp. 1057-1067; Mutz, D.C., (2006) Hearing the other side: Deliberative versus participatory democracy, , New York, NY: Cambridge University Press; Rule, N.O., Ambady, N., Democrats and republicans can be differentiated from their faces (2010) PLoS One, 5; Schanck, R.L., A study of a community and its groups and institutions conceived of as behaviors of individuals (1932) Psychological Monographs, 43 (2), p. 133; Sturgis, P., Roberts, C., Smith, P., Middle alternatives revisited: How the neither/nor response acts as a way of saying “I don’t know”?

Wordscores claims to scale documents on specified dimensions without requiring researchers to read or even understand the language of the input text. We investigate whether Wordscores delivers this claim by scaling the Euromanifestos of 117 political parties across 23 countries on 4 salient dimensions of political conflict. We assess validity by comparing the Wordscores estimates to expert surveys and other judgmental measures, and by examining the Wordscores’s estimates ability to predict party membership in the European Parliament groups. We find that the Wordscores estimates correlate poorly with expert and judgmental measures of party positions, while the latter outperform Wordscores in the predictive validity test. We conclude that Wordscores does not live up to its original claim of a “quick and easy” language blind method, and urge researchers to demonstrate the validity of the method in their domain of interest before any empirical analysis. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

Even in the age of digital trace data and passive audience measurement, the workhorse of basically all communication research is self-report data. This article presents a meta-analysis of the reliability and temporal stability of media exposure self-reports in 33 panel studies. Results from a Bayesian multilevel analysis show that self-reported media exposure was moderately reliable (0.69, 90% HDI: 0.65, 0.72) and highly stable (0.90, 90% HDI: 0.88, 0.92). In line with previous studies, the reliability of media exposure measures was higher in adult samples (0.72, 90% HDI: 0.69, 0.76) compared to adolescents (0.60, 90% HDI: 0.53, 0.66). Rank-order stability of media exposure was comparable in adult (0.91, 90% HDI: 0.89, 0.93) and adolescent samples (0.85, 90% HDI: 0.81, 0.90). Moderation analyses showed that self-reported exposure to specific outlets was more reliable than general media use in adult samples. Media-specific differences in reliability were only found in adolescent samples.

However, widely used self-affirmation instruments have several disadvantages that can lead to inconsistent success in generating self-affirmation and thus may explain inconsistent self-affirmation effects, or at the very least make their use cumbersome. In a series of three sequential studies, we introduced and tested a brief attribute scale format self-affirmation induction (brief scale affirmation task, or B-SAT) that was based on the 32-item attribute scale self-affirmation induction developed by Napper, Harris, and Epton. Using different behavioral contexts, we compared the performance of the B-SAT with that of two widely used self-affirmation inductions, i.e., the value essay task and the 32-item attribute scale. From a convergent validity perspective, the B-SAT performed as effectively as the two existing inductions in making people aware of their cherished and desirable values. From a predictive validity perspective, the B-SAT reduced defensive responses to a self-relevant health message and improved instrumental attitude toward the recommended behavior. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,"University of Minnesota, UM","This work was supported by Carmen Radecki Breitkopf, Ph.D., Department of Health Sciences Research, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN; University of Minnesota Hubbard School of Journalism and Mass Communication Ralph D.

Visual behavior—referring broadly to metrics and measures of gaze positioning and movement—has been used to assess variables including exposure time, cognitive processing, prominence, and (visual) attention. Over the past decade, communication science researchers have increased their use of eye-tracking methods in published articles. During that same period, technological innovations have made eye-tracking units more affordable and accessible to interested researchers increasing the likelihood that eye-tracking research will continue to increase in the field. In this article, we provide information on eye tracking in hopes of improving the quality and reporting of eye-tracking research in communication. The article first provides an overview of basic eye-tracking information followed by a systematic review on the reporting of eye-tracking methods in communication-relevant research. We then provide eye-tracking research reporting recommendations and some ideas about how eye tracking might be integrated into scholarly work moving forward with the aim of improving the transparency and replicability of eye-tracking research in communication science. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Most researchers employ retrospective survey measurement, thus depending on the accuracy of users’ memories and generalizations. Alternatively, some researchers rely on in-situ measurement, being less dependent on users’ memories and generalizations, but requiring random situation samples. To assess differences and similarities between these two measurement approaches we analyzed whether characteristics (duration and frequency of a usage episode, habit, elaboration, and gratifications) of MSM use (regarding Facebook, WhatsApp, and YouTube) vary between retrospective survey and mobile experience sampling measurement. We observe a consistent pattern of higher estimates in retrospect as compared to individual averages of in-situ reports. The absolute magnitude of these differences varies considerably between platforms and characteristics studied. Nonetheless, for most constructs and platforms we find low significant positive correlations between retrospective and aggregated in-situ values. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Abeele, M.V., Beullens, K., Roe, K., Measuring mobile phone use: Gender, age and real usage level in relation to the accuracy and validity of self-reported mobile phone use (2013) Mobile Media & Communication, 1 (2), pp. 213-236; Bayer, J.B., Dal Cin, S., Campbell, S.W., Panek, E., Consciousness and self-regulation in mobile communication (2016) Human Communication Research, 42 (1), pp. 71-97; Bayer, J.B., Ellison, N.B., Schoenebeck, S.Y., Falk, E.B., Sharing the small moments: Ephemeral social interaction on Snapchat (2016) Information, Communication & Society, 19 (7), pp. 956-977; Betsch, T., Brinkmann, B.J., Fiedler, K., Breining, K., When prior knowledge overrules new evidence: Adaptive use of decision strategies and the role of behavioral routines (1999) Swiss Journal of Psychology, 58 (3), pp. 151-160; Blair, E., Burton, S., Cognitive processes used by survey respondents to answer behavioral frequency questions (1987) Journal of Consumer Research, 14 (2), pp. 280-288; Boase, J., Kobayashi, T., Theoretical implications of digital trace data: Insight from the development of a mobile smartphone application (2012) Presented at the Social science and digital research: Interdisciplinary insights symposium, , March, Oxford Internet Institute, Oxford, UK; Boase, J., Ling, R.S., Measuring mobile phone use: Self-report versus log data (2013) Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication, 18 (4), pp. 508-519; Bolger, N., Davis, A., Rafaeli, E., Diary methods: Capturing life as it is lived (2003) Annual Review of Psychology, 54 (1), pp. 579-616; Bradburn, N., Rips, L., Shevell, S., Answering autobiographical questions: The impact of memory and inference on surveys (1987) Science, 236 (4798), pp. 157-161; Brandt, J., Weiss, N., Klemmer, S.R., txt 4 l8r: Lowering the burden for diary studies under mobile conditions (2007) Extended abstracts on human factors in computing systems, pp. 2303-2308. , San Jose, CA: ACM, &,.

From a methodological point of view, the robustness of a combined approach is examined. For this purpose the results of different machine translation services (Google Translate vs. DeepL) as well as methods (full-text vs. term-by-term) are compared. From a substantive point of view, the integratability of the approach into comparative study designs is tested. For this, the online discourses about climate change in Germany, the United Kingdom, and the United States are compared. First, the results show that the approach is relatively robust and second, that integration in comparative study designs is not a problem. It is concluded that this as well as the relatively moderate costs in terms of time and money makes the strategy to couple topic models with machine translation a valuable addition to the toolbox of comparative communication researchers. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,"Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG: 155794648

Sandage Department of Advertising, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, United States","Media multitasking has been receiving increased attention from communication scholars as well as scholar in other fields, with studies focusing on the prevalence, predictors, behavior, and effects. Several recent papers have provided overviews of findings from media multitasking research, or provided frameworks to help researchers think about conceptual issues around multitasking. This article expands on those efforts by refining the methodological elements that are important to consider in media multitasking research. We discuss the validity of operationalizations in previous studies, and the impact that design and measures had on the conclusions drawn. In order to do this, we map the different options for manipulating and measuring media multitasking, discuss the implications, and provide guidelines for future research examining media multitasking to help connect disparate findings and provide additional guidance for researchers to move forward with this topic. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Adler, R.F., Benbunan-Fich, R., Juggling on a high wire: Multitasking effects on performance (2012) International Journal of Human-Computer Studies, 70 (2), pp. 156-168; Ainasoja, M., Linna, J., Heikkilä, P., Lammi, H., Oksman, V., A case study on understanding 2nd screen usage during a live broadcast.

Common solutions to this problem are usually based on proximity methods that require a large corpus to reach reasonable levels of accuracy. We show how such methods for the association between an entity and a representation yield a high percentage of false positives at the expression level and low validity at the document level. We introduce a solution that combines syntactic parsing, semantic role labeling logic, and a machine learning approach—the role-based association method. To test our method, we compared it with prevalent methods of association on the news coverage of two entities of interest—the State of Israel and the Palestinian Authority. We found that the role-based association method is more accurate at the expression and the document levels. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,"Ministry of Science and Technology, Israel","This research was supported by the Ministry of Science and Technology, Israel; TheLeonard Davis Institute for International Relations.",,"Adcock, R., Collier, D., Measurement validity: A shared standard for qualitative and quantitative research (2001) American Political Science Review, 95 (3), pp. 529-546. , http://journals.cambridge.org/abstract_S0003055401003100, Retrieved from; Arendt, F., Karadas, N., Content analysis of mediated associations: An automated text-analytic approach (2017) Communication Methods and Measures, 11 (2), pp. 105-120; Balahur, A., Steinberger, R., Kabadjov, M., Zavarella, V., Van Der Goot, E., Halkia, M., Belyaeva, J., Sentiment analysis in the News (2010) Proceedings of the Seventh conference on International Language Resources and Evaluation (LREC’10), , Valletta, Malta: Retrieved from, …; Banerjee, S., Pedersen, T., An adapted lesk algorithm for word sense disambiguation using wordnet (2002) Proceedings of the Third International Conference on Computational Linguistics and Intelligent Text Processing (CICLing ’02), pp. 136-145. , https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/3-540-45715-1_11, Mexico City: Retrieved from, &; Bautin, M., Vijayarenu, L., Skiena, S., International sentiment analysis for news and blogs (2008) ICWSM, pp. 19-26. , http://www.aaai.org/Papers/ICWSM/2008/ICWSM08-010.pdf, Seattle: Retrieved from, &; Bélanger, É., Soroka, S., Campaigns and the prediction of election outcomes : Can historical and campaign-period prediction models be combined?

The current project extends this line of research by designing (Study 1) and implementing (Study 2) a measurement of social network interdependence. Scales of network interference and facilitation are developed and probed using exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis. Results support distinct measures of network interference and facilitation. Invariance between differencing samples is tested for using multi-factor CFA. Results showed that measures of network interference and facilitation significantly vary between married and dating couples. Finally, convergent, divergent, and concurrent validity is tested for subscales using variables in relational turbulence theory. Results demonstrate that network interference and facilitation uniquely impact outcome variables above and beyond experiences of partner interference and facilitation. Results are discussed in terms of theory development. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Agnew, C.R., Loving, T.L., Drigotas, S.M., Substituting the forest for trees: Social networks and the prediction of romantic relationship state and fate (2001) Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 81, pp. 1042-1057; Berscheid, E., Kelley, H.H., Berscheid, E., Christensen, A., Harvey, J., Huston, T.L., Levinger, G., Peterson, D.R., Emotion (1983) Close relationships, pp. 110-168. , San Francisco, CA: Freeman,. …, (Eds; Dillard, J.P., Kinney, T.A., Cruz, M.G., Influence, appraisals, and emotions in close relationships (1996) Communications Monographs, 63 (2), pp. 105-130; Felmlee, D.H., No couple is an island: A social network perspective on dyadic stability (2001) Social Forces, 79 (4), pp. 1259-1287; Hill, R.A., Dunbar, R.I., Social network size in humans (2003) Human Nature, 14, pp. 53-72; Hu, L.-T., Bentler, P.M., Cutoff criteria for fit indexes in covariance structure analysis: Conventional criteria versus new alternatives (1999) Structural Equation Modeling, 8, pp. 205-223; Knobloch, L.K., Theiss, J.A., An actor—Partner interdependence model of relational turbulence: Cognitions and emotions (2010) Journal of Social and Personal Relationships, 27, pp. 595-619; Knobloch, L.K., Theiss, J.A., Relational uncertainty and relationship talk within courtship: A longitudinal actor-partner interdependence model (2011) Communication Monographs, 78, pp. 3-26; Parks, M.R., Adelman, M.B., Communication networks and the development of romantic relationships: An expansion of uncertainty reduction theory (1983) Human Communication Research, 10, pp. 55-79; Parks, M.R., Stan, C.M., Eggert, L.L., Romanic involvement and social network involvement (1983) Social Psychology Quarterly, 46, pp. 116-131; Solomon, D.H., Knobloch, L.K., Relationship uncertainty, partner interference, and intimacy within dating relationships (2001) Journal of Social and Personal Relationships, 18 (6), pp. 804-820; Solomon, D.H., Knobloch, L.K., Theiss, J.A., McLaren, R.M., Relational turbulence theory: Explaining variation in subjective experiences and communication within romantic relationships (2016) Human Communication Research., 32 (4), pp. 469-503; Solomon, D.H., Theiss, J.A., A longitudinal test of the relational turbulence model on romantic relationship development (2008) Personal Relationships, 15, pp. 339-357; Sprecher, S., The influence of social networks on romantic relationships: Through the lens of the social network (2011) Personal Relationships, 18, pp. 630-644; Sprecher, S., Felmlee, D., Romantic partners’ perceptions of social network attributes with the passage of time and relationship transitions (2000) Personal Relationships, 7, pp. 325-340; Surra, C.A., Milardo’s, R.M., The influence of the interactive network on developing relationships (1988) Families and social networks, pp. 48-82. , Newbury Park, CA: Sage,.

However, much research is conducted at the level of individual news articles, despite the fact that news events are frequently presented as “stories” by news outlets: chains of connected articles offering follow up reporting as new facts emerge or covering the same event from different angles. These stories are theoretically highly important; they also create measurement issues for general quantitative studies of news output. Yet, thus far, the field has lacked an efficient method for detecting groups of articles which form stories in a way that enables their analysis. In this work, we present a novel, automated method for identifying news stories from within a corpus of articles, which makes use of techniques drawn from the fields of information retrieval and network analysis. We demonstrate the application of the method to a corpus of almost 40,000 news articles, and show that it can effectively identify valid story chains within the corpus. We use the results to make observations about the prevalence and dynamics of stories within the UK news media, showing that more than 50% of news production takes place within the form of story chains. © 2018, © 2018 The Author(s).

The empirical component of the approach combines evidence of (1) association of beliefs with intentions and (2) current level of beliefs to calculate a “percentage to gain” as the potential promise of a belief. However, the method relies on cross-sectional data; its conclusions are open to challenge. Here, a panel study assesses whether the calculated promise of a belief actually predicts future behavior change. A nationally representative sample of 3,204 U.S. youth and young adults were interviewed twice, six months apart. Sixteen beliefs about the benefits and costs of smoking cigarettes are compared with regard to their percentage to gain (calculated from cross-sectional data) and their ability to account for subsequent cigarette use. A belief’s cross-sectional percentage to gain is substantially associated with its ability to predict subsequent behavior change (r = .53, p < .05). © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,"U.S. Food and Drug Administration, FDA: P50CA179546

This presents opportunities for new discoveries, but also for the rapid spread of questionable practices. Here, we look to the future of fMRI in communication science: first, highlighting and advocating for several relatively new methods that should enable communication scholars to address novel research questions; and second, pointing out various controversies or pitfalls that exist in the use of several of the more widely used fMRI analysis methods within the field. Given the rapidly changing nature of the fMRI analysis landscape, such reflection is an essential part of being a good scholar in this domain. Our aim is to ensure that the future of fMRI in communication science is healthy, robust, and rich in variety, by encouraging all researchers in the field to think critically about the methods they use, whether that means adopting new analysis methods that can answer previously unanswerable questions, or adjusting their use of methods they already use to align with the latest recommended practices. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Afifi, T., Floyd, K., Biology and physiology in communication [special issue] (2014) Communication Monographs, 82 (1). , 1–178; Akritas, M.G., Limitations of the rank transform procedure: A study of repeated measures designs, Part I (1991) Journal of the American Statistical Association, 86, pp. 457-460; Alakörkkö, T., Saarimäki, H., Glerean, E., Saramäki, J., Korhonen, O., Effects of spatial smoothing on functional brain networks (2017) European Journal of Neuroscience, 46 (9), pp. 2471-2480; Anderson, M.J., A new method for non‐parametric multivariate analysis of variance (2001) Austral Ecology, 26, pp. 32-46; Ashby, F.G., (2011) Statistical analysis of fMRI data, , Cambridge, MA: MIT press; Bassett, D.S., Sporns, O., Network neuroscience (2017) Nature Neuroscience, 20, pp. 353-364; Bond, R.M., Fariss, C.J., Jones, J.J., Kramer, A.D., Marlow, C., Settle, J.E., Fowler, J.H., A 61-million-person experiment in social influence and political mobilization (2012) Nature, 489 (7415), pp. 295-298. , &; Bush, K., Cisler, J., Decoding neural events from fMRI BOLD signal: A comparison of existing approaches and development of a new algorithm (2013) Magnetic Resonance Imaging, 31, pp. 976-989; Butts, C.T., Revisiting the foundations of network analysis (2009) Science, 325, pp. 414-416; Button, K.S., Ioannidis, J.P., Mokrysz, C., Nosek, B.A., Flint, J., Robinson, E.S., Munafò, M.R., Power failure: Why small sample size undermines the reliability of neuroscience (2013) Nature Reviews Neuroscience, 14 (5), p. 365. , &; Carp, J., The secret lives of experiments: Methods reporting in the fMRI literature (2012) Neuroimage, 63, pp. 289-300; Chen, G., Taylor, P.A., Shin, Y.-W., Reynolds, R.C., Cox, R.W., Untangling the relatedness among correlations, part II: Inter-subject correlation group analysis through linear mixed-effects modeling (2017) Neuroimage, 147, pp. 825-840; Chua, H.F., Liberzon, I., Welsh, R.C., Strecher, V.J., Neural correlates of message tailoring and self-relatedness in smoking cessation programming (2009) Biological Psychiatry, 65 (2), pp. 165-168; Cooper, N., Bassett, D.S., Falk, E.B., Coherent activity between brain regions that code for value is linked to the malleability of human behavior (2017) Scientific Reports, 7, p. 43250; Craddock, R.C., James, G.A., Holtzheimer, P.E., Hu, X.P., Mayberg, H.S., A whole brain fMRI atlas generated via spatially constrained spectral clustering (2012) Human Brain Mapping, 33, pp. 1914-1928; Cremers, H.R., Wager, T.D., Yarkoni, T., The relation between statistical power and inference in fMRI (2017) PLOS One, 12; Donohew, L., Palmgreen, P., Duncan, J., An activation model of information exposure (1980) Communications Monographs, 47 (4), pp. 295-303. , &; Davis, T., Poldrack, R.A., Measuring neural representations with fMRI: Practices and pitfalls (2013) Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences, 1296, pp. 108-134; Dubois, J., Adolphs, R., Building a science of individual differences from fMRI (2016) Trends in Cognitive Sciences, 20, pp. 425-443; Eagle, N., Pentland, A.S., Lazer, D., Inferring friendship network structure by using mobile phone data (2009) Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 106 (36), pp. 15274-15278; Eklund, A., Nichols, T.E., Knutsson, H., Cluster failure: Why fMRI inferences for spatial extent have inflated false-positive rates (2016) Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 113, pp. 7900-7905; Falk, E.B., Bassett, D.S., Brain and social networks: Fundamental building blocks of human experience (2017) Trends in Cognitive Sciences, 21, pp. 674-690; Falk, E.B., Berkman, E.T., Lieberman, M.D., From neural responses to population behavior: Neural focus group predicts population-level media effects (2012) Psychological Science, 23, pp. 439-445; Falk, E.B., Cascio, C.N., Coronel, J.C., Neural prediction of communication-relevant outcomes (2015) Communication Methods and Measures, 9, pp. 30-54; Falk, E.B., O’Donnell, M.B., Tompson, S., Gonzalez, R., Dal Cin, S.D., Strecher, V., An, L., Functional brain imaging predicts public health campaign success (2016) Social Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience, 11 (2), pp. 204-214. , …; Fisher, J., Huskey, R., Keene, J., Weber, R., (2018) The limited capacity model of motivated mediated message processing: Looking to the future, , Manuscript submitted for publication, &,.

However, there still is no valid and accepted measure of generalized trust in news media. To establish and test a suitable measure, we chose two elaborate scales of related concepts: the scale on trust in media coverage of a specific topic by Kohring and Matthes and a credibility scale by Yale, Jensen, Carcioppolo, Sun, and Liu. We adapted both to measure generalized trust in news media and conducted a survey in Germany to (a) evaluate the dimensional structures of both adapted scales and (b) analyze their predictive validity by testing their explanative power on alternative media use. Both adapted scales yield well-fitting models but should be carefully treated with respect to discriminant validity. The adapted Kohring and Matthes scale successfully predicts alternative media use and can therefore be recommended for further research on generalized trust in news media. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Abdulla, R.A., Garrison, B., Salwen, M.B., Driscoll, P.D., Casey, D., Salwen, M.B., Garrison, B., Driscoll, P.D., Online news credibility (2005) Online news and the public, pp. 147-163. , Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum, &,. &, (Eds; (2008) American national election studies questionnaire utility, , http://isr-anesweb.isr.umich.edu/_ANESweb/utilities/questutility/varfiles/Q343_2008.htm, Retrieved from; Brown, T.A., Confirmatory factor analysis for applied research (2015) Methodology in the social sciences, , 2nd, New York, NY: Guilford Press,. ed; Brown, T.A., Moore, M.T., Hoyle, R.H., Confirmatory factor analysis (2012) Handbook of structural equation modeling, pp. 361-379. , New York, NY: Guilford Press, &,.

To date, despite the amount of empirical research utilizing mock website experiments, no openly accessible practical implementations tailored to the needs of communication scholars exist. In this paper, we first review extant implementations of mock website experiments in selective exposure research and outline the methodological shortcomings. We then outline a procedure to conduct mock website experiments that addresses these shortcomings using only freely available software and that does not restrict participants to specific devices nor require additional software to be installed. Additionally, it can be employed and easily adapted without further programming knowledge as all scripts are published open-source on GitHub. We also demonstrate an application of the procedure by outlining a study on selective exposure to search engine content (N = 1,187). Further applications and limitations of the procedure are discussed. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Agichtein, E., Brill, E., Dumais, S., Ragno, R., Learning user interaction models for predicting web search result preferences (2006) Proceedings of the 29th Annual International ACM SIGIR Conference on research and development in information retrieval, pp. 3-10; Bennett, W.L., Iyengar, S., A new era of minimal effects?

One statistical problem that gained relevance in the era of big data is high-dimensional statistical inference, when the number of variables greatly exceeds the number of observations. Typically, prediction errors in linear regression skyrocket when the number of included variables gets close to the number of observations, and ordinary least squares (OLS) regression no longer works in a high-dimensional scenario. Regularized estimators as a feasible solution include the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (Lasso), which we introduce to communication scholars here. We will include the statistical background of this technique that combines estimation and variable selection simultaneously and helps identify relevant variables for regression models in high-dimensional scenarios. We contrast the Lasso with two alternative strategies of selecting variables for regression models, namely, a theory-based “subset selection” of variables and a nonselective “all in” strategy. The simulation shows that the Lasso produces lower and more relatively stable prediction errors than the two alternative variable selection strategies, and it is therefore recommended to use, especially in high-dimensional settings typical in times of big data analysis. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Belloni, A., Hansen, C., Chernozhukov, V., High-dimensional methods and inference on structural and treatment effects (2014) Journal of Economic Perspectives, 28 (2), pp. 1-23; Boase, J., Augmenting survey and experimental designs with digital trace data (2016) Communication Methods and Measures, 10 (2-3), pp. 165-166; Efron, B., Hastie, T., Johnstone, I., Tibshirani, R., Least angle regresssion (2004) The Annals of Statistics, 32 (2), pp. 407-499; Feature selection using LASSO (2017) Research Paper in Business Analytics.

However, few guidelines exist for returning research findings to participants although participants often desire access to the results of the studies in which they participate, and researchers are often interested in providing results. Furthermore, little research has considered the benefits and challenges of returning findings to participants outside of bioethics contexts. The decision to return findings to the individuals and/or communities from which they were taken upholds three key ethical principles, which work together to form the analytical framework for this study: respect for persons/autonomy, non-maleficence, and beneficence. Therefore, this study offers “best practices” for returning findings to participants as an ethical obligation for communication researchers. By utilizing the “expert panel process” to benchmark a panel of published expert opinions establishing ethical standards within human subject research, the purpose of this study is to aggregate and synthesize existing recommendations via grounded theory to produce novel translational insights for scholars not engaged in clinical health research. We conclude by providing seven best practices for effectively returning findings to participants based on our synthesis of the expert sources. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Baxter, L.A., Babbie, E., (2004) The basics of communication research, , Belmont, CA: Wadsworth Thomson; Buzzanell, P.M., Resilience: Talking, resisting, and imagining new normalcies into being (2010) Journal of Communication, 60, pp. 1-14; Charmaz, K., Premises, principles, and practices in qualitative research: Revisiting the foundations (2004) Qualitative Health Research, 14, pp. 976-993; Cooper, M., Sharing data and results in ethnographic research: Why this should not be an ethical imperative (2007) Journal of Empirical Research on Human Research Ethics, 2, pp. 3-19. , https://www.10.1525%2Fjer.2007.2.1.3; Cooper, M., Sharing data and results with study participants: Report on a survey of cultural anthropologists (2008) Journal of Empirical Research on Human Research Ethics, 3, pp. 19-34. , https://www.10.1525%2Fjer.2008.3.4.19; Ellingson, L.L., “Then you know how I feel”: Empathy, identification, and reflexivity in fieldwork (1998) Qualitative Inquiry, 4, pp. 492-514. , https://www.10.1177%2F107780049800400405; Fernandez, C.V., Kodish, E., Taweel, S., Shurin, S., Weijer, C., Disclosure of the right of research participants to receive research results: An analysis of consent forms in the Children’s Oncology Group (2003) Cancer: Interdisciplinary International Journal of the American Cancer Society, 97, pp. 2904-2909; Fernandez, C.V., Kodish, E., Weijer, C., Informing study participants of research results: An ethical imperative (2003) IRB: Ethics & Human Research, 25, pp. 12-19; Ferris, L.E., Sass-Kortsak, A., Sharing research findings with research participants and communities (2011) The International Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine, 2, pp. 172-181; Glaser, B., Strauss, A., (1967) The discovery of grounded theory: Strategies for qualitative research, , London, UK: Weidenfeld and Nicholson; Goldblatt, H., Karnieli-Miller, O., Neumann, M., Sharing qualitative research findings with participants: Study experiences of methodological and ethical dilemmas (2011) Patient Education and Counseling, 82, pp. 389-395; Hernick, A.D., Brown, M.K., Pinney, S.M., Biro, F.M., Ball, K.M., Bornschein, R.L., Sharing unexpected biomarker results with study participants (2010) Environmental Health Perspectives, 119, pp. 1-5; Hintz, E.A., The vulvar vernacular: Dilemmas experienced and strategies recommended by women with chronic genital pain (2018) Health Communication, ,  ,.

This practice has been underwritten by pointing to positive correlations between individuals’ PME and AME scores. This essay argues that such correlations do not–and cannot–show that messages’ relative standing on PME matches their relative standing on AME, and thus correlations between individuals’ PME and AME scores are irrelevant to the question of whether PME assessments accurately identify relatively more effective messages. Only correlations between messages’ PME and AME scores can indicate whether PME measures provide successful prediction of messages’ relative AME standing. But positive correlations between individuals’ PME and AME scores do suggest a possible repurposing of PME measures in formative research. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

This article suggests that field experiments, conducted through a self-reflexive critical studies lens, are one way that communication researchers may address some of these barriers while keeping in mind sensitivity to inherent power imbalances. While considering the ongoing debate regarding the use of student samples in communication research, this paper examines one longitudinal field experiment that investigated the role of stable ICT access on health outcomes. We discuss the power dynamics at play in the relationships between the primary investigator, research assistants, and participants as well as describe the tradeoffs that are considered in this type of work. The marrying of the positivistic approach of field experiment with a critical studies lens can benefit a growing body of scholarship from various epistemological traditions, invested in socially conscious research within marginalized communities. We provide a self-reflexive analysis of our study along with practical recommendations within the context of our challenges and successes. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,UL1TR002529,This work was supported by a Project Development Team within the ICTSI NIH/NCRR [grant number UL1TR002529].,,"Abell, J., Locke, A., Condor, S., Gibson, S., Stevenson, C., Trying similarity, doing difference: The role of interviewer self-disclosure in interview talk with young people (2006) Qualitative Research, 6, pp. 221-244; Abu-Lughod, L., (2001) Dramas of nationhood: The politics of television in Egypt, , Chicago, IL: The University of Chicago Press; Bailard, C.S., A field experiment on the internet’s effect in an African election: Savvier citizens, disaffecting voters, or both?

PME is also used to examine receptivity of messages after they are fully developed or deployed. Despite this, we know little about the conceptual and methodological characteristics of extant PME measures used in the literature. We conducted a systematic review of tobacco education video, print, and audio campaign studies to examine conceptual and methodological characteristics of PME measures. One hundred twenty-six PME measures from 75 studies conducted in 21 countries with more than 61,000 participants were reviewed. Results indicated considerable variability in measures’ focus on general perceptions of a message (i.e., message perceptions) vs. perceptions of expected message effects (i.e., effects perceptions). Considerable variability was also found on underlying persuasive constructs, use of referents, and referencing of behavior in PME items and measures. We conclude with several recommendations for future research on PME measurement and validation. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,"U.S. Food and Drug Administration, FDA

This study deconstructs the familiar summary network heterogeneity measure to examine why it produces incongruous results relative to other measures used in the literature. This study pays particular attention to the multiple strategies that exist for handling non-partisans when creating the measure. Additionally, it focuses on the “extreme views” items included in its construction, which are conceptually and methodologically distinct from other items and rarely theoretically justified. Results demonstrate that summary network heterogeneity is best thought of an as index, rather than as a scale, which has implications for how scholars should approach it. Critically, inclusion of the extreme views items and decisions about data exclusion also have substantive consequences; this highlights the need for further inquiry into extremity and for explicit reporting about data-handling decisions. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Ansolabehere, S., Schaffner, B.F., Does survey mode still matter?

We use transfer entropy to measure directed information flows from human emotions to YouTube’s video recommendation engine, and back, from recommended videos to users’ emotions. We find that algorithmic recommendations communicate a statistically significant amount of positive and negative affect to humans. Joy is prevalent in emotional polarization, while sadness and fear play significant roles in emotional convergence. These findings can help to design more socially responsible algorithms by starting to focus on the emotional content of algorithmic recommendations. Employing a computational-experimental mixed method approach, the study serves as a demonstration of how the mathematical theory of communication can be used both to quantify human-machine communication, and to test hypotheses in the social sciences. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Abelson, R., Kinder, D., Peters, M., Fiske, S., Affective and semantic components in political person perception (1982) Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 42 (4), pp. 619-630; (2017) Alexa top 500 global sites, , http://www.alexa.com/topsites, Retrieved February 28, 2017, from; Amblard, P.-O., Michel, O.J.J., On directed information theory and Granger causality graphs (2011) Journal of Computational Neuroscience, 30 (1), pp. 7-16; Attneave, F., (1959) Applications of information theory to psychology: A summary of basic concepts, methods, and results, 7. , Oxford, England: Henry Holt; Baek, S.K., Jung, W.-S., Kwon, O., Moon, H.-T., Transfer entropy analysis of the stock market (2005) ArXiv:Physics/0509014, , http://arxiv.org/abs/physics/0509014, Retrieved from; Bakshy, E., Messing, S., Adamic, L.A., Exposure to ideologically diverse news and opinion on Facebook (2015) Science, 348 (6239), pp. 1130-1132; Bessi, A., Zollo, F., Vicario, M.D., Puliga, M., Scala, A., Caldarelli, G., Quattrociocchi, W., Users polarization on facebook and youtube (2016) PLOS ONE, 11 (8). , …; Borge-Holthoefer, J., Perra, N., Gonçalves, B., González-Bailón, S., Arenas, A., Moreno, Y., Vespignani, A., The dynamics of information-driven coordination phenomena: A transfer entropy analysis (2016) Science Advances, 2 (4), p. e1501158; Bucy, E., Emotional and evaluative consequences of inappropriate leader displays (2000) Communication Research, 27 (2), pp. 194-226; The 2016 digital future report, surveying the digital future, year fourteen (2016) USC Annenberg School Center for the Digital Future, , http://www.digitalcenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/2016-Digital-Future-Report.pdf, Retrieved from; Chávez, M., Martinerie, J., Le Van Quyen, M., Statistical assessment of nonlinear causality: Application to epileptic EEG signals (2003) Journal of Neuroscience Methods, 124 (2), pp. 113-128; Cho, J., Campaign tone, political affect, and communicative engagement (2013) Journal of Communication, 63 (6), pp. 1130-1152; Colleoni, E., Rozza, A., Arvidsson, A., Echo chamber or public sphere? predicting political orientation and measuring political homophily in twitter using big data (2014) Journal of Communication, 64 (2), pp. 317-332; Cover, T.M., Thomas, J.A., (2006) Elements of information theory, , 2nd, Hoboken, NJ: Wiley-Interscience, &, ed; Covington, P., Adams, J., Sargin, E., Deep neural networks for youtube recommendations (2016) In Proceedings of the 10th ACM Conference on Recommender Systems, , New York: ACM; Derks, D., Fischer, A.H., Bos, A.E.R., Review: The Role of Emotion in Computer-mediated Communication: A Review (2008) Comput.

Complementing a growing body of scholarship that draws on the CCA to address the structural contexts of health in the subaltern margins across the globe, this article lays out the methodological framework of the CCA. It highlights the key conceptual anchors that serve as foundations of the approach, suggesting that participation, partnerships, communication, dialogue, and reflexivity offer methodological tools that interrogate the reproduction of erasures within dominant structures, and create entry points for subaltern voices to arrive into hegemony. The essay wraps up by offering specific strategies and tools for designing culture-centered projects that may be adopted by activists, community advocates and organizers, and academics working in academic-community partnerships in the backdrop of health disparities. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,"National University of Singapore, NUS",This work was supported by the National University of Singapore.

This special issue discusses the validity of using big data in communication science and showcases a number of new methods and applications in the fields of text and network analysis. Computational methods have the potential to greatly enhance the scientific study of communication because they allow us to move towards collaborative large-N studies of actual behavior in its social context. This requires us to develop new skills and infrastructure and meet the challenges of open, valid, reliable, and ethical “big data” research. By bringing together a number of leading scholars in one issue, we contribute to the increasing development and adaptation of computational methods in communication science. © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Alvarez, R.M., (2016) Computational social science: Discovery and prediction, , Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press, (Ed; An, W., Fitting ERGMs on big networks (2016) Social Science Research, 59, pp. 107-119; Araujo, T., Wonneberger, A., Neijens, P., de Vreese, C., How much time do you spend online? understanding and improving the accuracy of self-reported measures of internet use (2017) Communication Methods and Measures, 11 (3), pp. 173-190; Barabási, A., (2016) Network science, , Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press; Blei, D.M., Ng, A.Y., Jordan, M.I., Latent dirichlet allocation (2003) The Journal of Machine Learning Research, 3, pp. 993-1022; Bodo, B., Helberger, N., Irion, K., Zuiderveen Borgesius, F., Moller, J., van de Velde, B., de Vreese, C., Tackling the algorithmic control crisis-the technical, legal, and ethical challenges of research into algorithmic agents (2017) Yale JL & Technical, 19, p. 133; Bond, R.M., Fariss, C.J., Jones, J.J., Kramer, A.D., Marlow, C., Settle, J.E., Fowler, J.H., A 61-million-person experiment in social influence and political mobilization (2012) Nature, 489 (7415), p. 295; Boumans, J.W., Trilling, D., Taking stock of the toolkit: An overview of relevant automated content analysis approaches and techniques for digital journalism scholars (2016) Digital Journalism, 4 (1), pp. 8-23; Boyd, D., Crawford, K., Critical questions for big data: Provocations for a cultural, technological, and scholarly phenomenon (2012) Information, Communication & Society, 15 (5), pp. 662-679; Chang, J., Gerrish, S., Wang, C., Boyd-Graber, J.L., Blei, D.M., Reading tea leaves: How humans interpret topic models (2009) Advances in neural information processing systems, , New York, NY: Curran Associates; Colleoni, E., Rozza, A., Arvidsson, A., Echo chamber or public sphere? predicting political orientation and measuring political homophily in twitter using big data (2014) Journal of Communication, 64 (2), pp. 317-332; Collingwood, L., Wilkerson, J., Tradeoffs in accuracy and efficiency in supervised learning methods (2012) Journal of Information Technology & Politics, 9 (3), pp. 298-318; Costera Meijer, I., Groot Kormelink, T., Checking, sharing, clicking and linking: Changing patterns of news use between 2004 and 2014 (2015) Digital Journalism, 3 (5), pp. 664-679; Crosas, M., King, G., Honaker, J., Sweeney, L., Automating open science for big data (2015) The ANNALS of the American Academy of Political and Social Science, 659 (1), pp. 260-273; De Choudhury, M., Lin, Y.-R., Sundaram, H., Candan, K.S., Xie, L., Kelliher, A., How does the data sampling strategy impact the discovery of information diffusion in social media?

Web archives are large-scale databases containing comprehensive records of websites showing how those websites have evolved over time. Recent communication scholarship using web archives is reviewed, demonstrating the breadth of research conducted in this space. Subsequently, a methodological framework is proposed for using web archives in computational communication research. As a source of data, web archives present a number of methodological challenges, particularly with regards to the accuracy and completeness of web archives. These problems are addressed in order to better inform future work in this area. The closing sections outline a forward-looking trajectory for computational communication research using web archives. © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,"National Science Foundation, NSF

A large body of research has supported many of MFT’s and the MIME’s central hypotheses. Yet, an important prerequisite of this research—the ability to extract latent moral content represented in media stimuli with a reliable procedure—has not been systematically studied. In this article, we subject different extraction procedures to rigorous tests, underscore challenges by identifying a range of reliabilities, develop new reliability test and coding procedures employing computational methods, and provide solutions that maximize the reliability and validity of moral intuition extraction. In six content analytical studies, including a large crowd-based study, we demonstrate that: (1) traditional content analytical approaches lead to rather low reliabilities; (2) variation in coding reliabilities can be predicted by both text features and characteristics of the human coders; and (3) reliability is largely unaffected by the detail of coder training. We show that a coding task with simplified training and a coding technique that treats moral foundations as fast, spontaneous intuitions leads to acceptable inter-rater agreement, and potentially to more valid moral intuition extractions. While this study was motivated by issues related to MFT and MIME research, the methods and findings in this study have implications for extracting latent content from text narratives that go beyond moral information. Accordingly, we provide a tool for researchers interested in applying this new approach in their own work. © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,"Army Research Laboratory, ARL: W911NF-15-2-0115","Contract grant sponsors: US Army Research Laboratory (to R.W.), contract grant number: W911NF-15-2-0115.",,"Ammerman, N.T., Marty, M.E., Appleby, R.S., North American fundamentalism (1991) Fundamentalisms observed, pp. 1-65. , Chicago, IL: University of Chicago,.

For instance, a researcher might use a specific program or a paid service to scrape some content from the Web, then use another program to process the resulting data, and finally conduct statistical analysis or produce some visualizations in yet another program. This makes it hard to build reproducible workflows, and even harder to build on the work of earlier studies. To improve this situation, we propose and discuss four criteria that a framework for automated content analysis should fulfill: scalability, free and open source, adaptability, and accessibility via multiple interfaces. We also describe how to put these considerations into practice, discuss their feasibility, and point toward future developments. © 2018 Damian Trilling and Jeroen G. F. Jonkman.

Yet, questions regarding reliability and validity of the approach have received little attention thus far. In applying LDA to textual data, researchers need to tackle at least four major challenges that affect these criteria: (a) appropriate pre-processing of the text collection; (b) adequate selection of model parameters, including the number of topics to be generated; (c) evaluation of the model’s reliability; and (d) the process of validly interpreting the resulting topics. We review the research literature dealing with these questions and propose a methodology that approaches these challenges. Our overall goal is to make LDA topic modeling more accessible to communication researchers and to ensure compliance with disciplinary standards. Consequently, we develop a brief hands-on user guide for applying LDA topic modeling. We demonstrate the value of our approach with empirical data from an ongoing research project. © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,"Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG

Social network research has begun to explore the factors that promote the assembly of scientific teams. However, this work has been limited by network approaches centered conceptually and analytically on “nodes as people,” or “nodes as teams.” In this article, we develop a “team-interlock ecosystem” conceptualization of collaborative environments within which new scientific teams, or other creative team-based enterprises, assemble. Team interlock ecosystems comprise teams linked to one another through overlapping memberships and/or overlapping knowledge domains. They depict teams, people, and knowledge sets as nodes, and thus, present both conceptual advantages as well as methodological challenges. Conceptually, team interlock ecosystems invite novel questions about how the structural characteristics of embedding ecosystems serve as the primordial soup from which new teams assemble. Methodologically, however, studying ecosystems requires the use of more advanced analytics that correspond to the inherently multilevel phenomenon of scientists nested within multiple teams. To address these methodological challenges, we advance the use of hypergraph methodologies combined with bibliometric data and simulation-based approaches to test hypotheses related to the ecosystem drivers of team assembly. © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,"National Institutes of Health, NIH

ARO W911NF-14-10686","We deploy a novel hypergraph methodology to test our hypotheses using bibliographic data about teams submitting research proposals to a Clinical and Translational Science Award (CTSA) competition hosted at a large Midwestern University and funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH). A total of 101 research teams, consisting of 147 participants, submitted proposals in two rounds of the grant competition. Given that we are examining the team assembly process, we excluded 47 proposals that were solo-authored. Additionally, eight proposals were excluded because either the exact same proposal team submitted proposals in both rounds of the competition (three teams) or because of data collection issues (five teams). The final dataset contains 46 proposals coauthored by 98 scientists, out of which only four proposals were awarded.","The preparation of this manuscript was supported by funding from the Army Research Office [ARO W911NF-14-10686] and the National Institutes of Health [R01GM112938, U01GM112623, UL1RR025741].","Acedo, F.J., Barroso, C., Casanueva, C., Galán, J.L., Co authorship in management and organizational studies: An empirical and network analysis (2006) Journal of Management Studies, 43 (5), pp. 957-983; Barabási, A.-L., Network theory–The emergence of the creative enterprise (2005) Science, 308 (5722), pp. 639-641; Barabási, A.-L., Albert, R., Emergence of scaling in random networks (1999) Science, 286 (5439), pp. 509-512; Berge, C., (1973) Graphs and hypergraphs.

The authors demonstrate how supervised machine learning could reduce Twitter sampling bias induced from “proxy-population mismatch”. Particularly, this study used the Random Forest (RF) classifier to disentangle tweet samples representative of general publics’ activities from non-general—or institutional—activities. By applying RF classifier models to Twitter data sets relevant to four news events and a randomly pooled dataset, the study finds systematic differences between general user samples and institutional user samples in their messaging patterns. This article calls for disentangling Twitter user samples when ordinary user behaviors are the focus of research. It also builds on the development of machine learning modeling in the context of communication research. © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,This work was supported by the 2017 Emerging Scholars Award from Association for Education in Journalism and Mass Communication.,,"Abokhodair, N., Yoo, D., McDonald, D.W., (2015) Dissecting a social botnet: Growth, content and influence in Twitter.

Kirkwood Avenue, Bloomington, IN  47405, United States","This study features the development and validation of a multidimensional scale for Perceived News Media Importance (PNMI), a concept pertaining to how much individuals personally value normative functions of political/public affairs journalism. Comprised of six different dimensions that represent the weight of what citizens deem to be desirable about news work, the PNMI concept exhibits the capacity to strengthen scholarly explanations about the public’s perceptions of the news media and related democratic outcomes. More specifically this research, which employs three data sets, is designed to (1) explicate the PNMI concept, (2) develop and validate a PNMI scale, (3) and explore PNMI’s predictive value relative to news media use and support for freedom of the press. Evidence of validity is confirmed with media trust, political media use, political interest, and ideology. Furthermore, PNMI is shown to be predictive of (a) mainstream and social media-based news use, as conditioned by perceptions of the press satisfactory performing normative functions, and (b) support for press freedoms. While the hypothesized PNMI model (as a higher order latent construct with six lower order dimensions) exhibits a sound model fit, a combined data set (total N=912) reveals that PNMI could also be treated as a multi-factor, lower-order latent construct. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,"Ohio State University, OSU",This research initiative was partially supported by the School of Communication Omnibus Survey Program at The Ohio State University and partially funded by the Office of the Vice Provost of Research at Indiana University Bloomington through the Grant-in-Aid Program.,,"Ajzen, I., The theory of planned behavior (1991) Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes, 50 (2), pp. 179-211; Althaus, S.L., Semetko, H.A., Scammell, M., What’s good and bad in political communication research?

While there is a growing interest in identifying the causal mechanisms and their contingencies using such nested structured data, the direct application of principles of (moderated) mediation analysis within traditional multilevel modeling framework is ambiguous and controversial. In this article, I provide a tutorial illustrating an approach to assessing mediation hypotheses based on path-analytic framework popularized by Hayes (2013). Focusing on estimation and inference of indirect effects with regard to nested data structure, I provide examples of the analysis within the context of egocentric network data, and illustrate implementation using Mplus software. ©, Published with license by Taylor & Francis. © 2018 Hyunjin Song.",,,,,,,,,,"Baron, R.M., Kenny, D.A., The moderator-mediator variable distinction in social psychological research: Conceptual, strategic, and statistical considerations (1986) Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 51, pp. 1173-1182; Bates, D., Mächler, M., Bolker, B., Walker, S., Fitting linear mixed-effects models using lme4 (2015) Journal of Statistical Software, 67 (1), pp. 1-48; Bauer, D.J., Preacher, K.J., Gil, K.M., Conceptualizing and testing random indirect effects and moderated mediation in multilevel models: New procedures and recommendations (2006) Psychological Methods, 11, pp. 142-163; Bello, J., Rolfe, M., Is influence mightier than selection?

The ecology of the deception lab typically involves researchers randomly assigning and instructing senders to lie or tell the truth. In lab-based lie detection tasks, receivers are prompted to make explicit truth-lie judgments in real time where truths and lies are equally probable, and where evidence and persuasion-based lie detection methods are precluded. Outside the lab, deceivers self-select, engage deception as a problem-solving activity, and have greater linguistic freedom to deceive in ways other than telling outright falsehoods. Receivers outside the lab face truth-lies base-rates other than 50–50, they are not prompted to consider the possibility of deception by a researcher, decisions about honesty often need not be immediate, and a wider variety of discovery methods are available.

Despite the central role that scales play in our predictions, scholars often apply measurement building procedures that are inconsistent with best practices. The defaults in statistical programs, inadequate training, and numerous evaluation points can lead to improper practices. Based on a quantitative content analysis of communication journal articles, scholars have improved very little in the communication of their scale development decisions and practices. To address these reoccurring issues, this article breaks down and recommends 10 steps to follow in the scale development process for researchers unfamiliar with the process. Furthermore, the present research makes a unique contribution by overviewing procedures scholars should employ to develop their dimensions and corresponding items. The overarching objective is to encourage the adoption of scale development best practices that yield stronger concepts, and in the long run, a more stable foundation of knowledge. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Aleamoni, L.M., The relation of sample size to the number of variables in using factor analysis techniques (1976) Educational and Psychological Measurement, 36, pp. 879-883; Barrett, P.T., Kline, P., The observation to variable ratio in factor analysis (1981) Personality Study and Group Behavior, 1, pp. 23-33; Beavers, A.S., Lounsbury, J.W., Richards, J.K., Huck, S.W., Skolits, G.J., Esquivel, S.L., Practical considerations for using exploratory factor analysis in education research (2013) Practical Assessment, Research & Evaluation, 18 (6), pp. 1-13; Bollen, K., Lennox, R., Conventional wisdom on measurement–a structural equation perspective (1991) MIS Quarterly, 28 (2), pp. 305-314; Borgotta, E.F., Kercher, K., Stull, D.E., A cautionary note on use of principal components analysis (1986) Sociological Methods and Research, 15, pp. 160-168; Broom, G.M., An open-system approach to building theory in public relations (2006) Journal of Public Relations Research, 18 (2), pp. 141-150; Carpenter, S., Grant, A.E., Hoag, A., Journalism Degree Motivations (JDM): The development of a scale (2016) Journalism & Mass Communication Educator, 71 (1), pp. 5-27; Carpenter, S., Makhadmeh, N., Thornton, L.J., Mentorship on the doctoral l level: An examination of communication mentors’ traits and functions (2015) Communication Education, 64 (3), pp. 366-384; Chaffee, S.H., (1991) Explication, , Beverly Hills, CA: Sage; Clark, L.A., Watson, D., Constructing validity: Basic issues in objective scale development (1995) Psychological Assessment, 7 (3), pp. 309-319; Comrey, A.L., Lee, H.B., (1992) A first course in factor analysis, , Hillsdale, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates; Conway, J.M., Huffcutt, A.I., A review and evaluation of exploratory factor analysis practices in organizational research (2003) Organizational Research Methods, 6 (2), pp. 147-168; Cooper, R., Potter, W.J., Dupagne, M., A status report on methods used in mass communication research (1994) Journalism Educator, 48 (4), pp. 54-61; Costello, A.B., Osborne, J.W., Best practices in exploratory factor analysis: Four recommendations for getting the most from your analysis (2005) Practical Assessment, Research & Evaluation, 10 (7), pp. 1-9; Couper, M.P., Rothgeb, J., Lessler, J., Martin, E.A., Martin, J., Singer, E., (2004) Methods for Testing and Evaluating Survey Questionnaires, , New York: Wiley, and; Cronbach, L.J., Meehl, P.E., Construct validity in psychological test (1955) Psychological Bulletin, 52, pp. 281-302; DeVellis, R.F., (2012) Scale development.

It can be a difficult method to apply, however, because it requires knowledge of various techniques, and the software required to perform most of these techniques is not readily available in common statistical software packages. In this teacher’s corner, we address these barriers by providing an overview of general steps and operations in a computational text analysis project, and demonstrate how each step can be performed using the R statistical software. As a popular open-source platform, R has an extensive user community that develops and maintains a wide range of text analysis packages.

Such studies linking survey data and media content data are often dubbed “linkage studies.” On the one hand, such designs are the state of the art in our field and on the other hand, they come with a long list of challenges and choices. This article reviews the rationales for linkage studies, outlines different types of linkage studies, reviews the state-of-the-art in this area, discusses which survey and content items to use in an analysis, reviews different types of analyses, outlines considerations for alternative specifications, and provides a step-by-step example. ©, Published with license by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC © Claes H.

The validity and reliability of the C-ME2 was tested in two independent samples (N = 678), among young adults (Study 1) and adolescents (Study 2). Results of Confirmatory Factor Analyses showed good fit, in both studies, for both antisocial and prosocial dimensions of media content, and for both males and females. Furthermore, the C-ME2 explains unique variance beyond previous measures of violent and general media exposure. Evidence is presented of reliability, discriminant and predictive validity of the C-ME2, measuring both frequency and exposure to specific content of media. The C-ME2 covers all media platforms, is easy to use in all research designs, and allows for standardization and systematic comparisons across studies. ©, Published with license by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC © A.

This study uses a longitudinal cohort study of Israeli university students (N = 800) aged 18–30, and a cross-sectional sample of U.S. college students (N = 498) to validate measures of information seeking about the nonmedical use of two drugs (marijuana and amphetamines) from a range of media and interpersonal sources.

Utilizing two empirical studies, this article systematically assesses the potential of crowdcoding for less manifest contents of news texts, here focusing on political actor evaluations. Specifically, Study 1 compares the reliability and validity of crowdcoded data to that of manual content analyses; Study 2 proceeds to investigate the effects of material presentation, different types of coding instructions and answer option formats on data quality. We find that the performance of the crowd recommends crowdcoded data as a reliable and valid alternative to manually coded data, also for less manifest contents. While scale manipulations affected the results, minor modifications of the coding instructions or material presentation did not significantly influence data quality. In sum, crowdcoding appears a robust instrument to collect quantitative content data. © 2017, Published with license by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC. © 2017 Fabienne Lind, Maria Gruber, and Hajo G.

Combining automatic tracking data and survey data from the same participants (N = 690) confirmed low levels of accuracy and tendencies of over-reporting. The analysis revealed biases due to a range of factors associated with the intensity of (actual) internet usage, propensity to multitask, day of reference, and the usage of mobile devices. An anchoring technique could not be proved to reduce inaccuracies of reporting behavior. Several recommendations for research practice follow from these findings. © 2017, Published with license by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC. © 2017 Theo Araujo, Anke Wonneberger, Peter Neijens, and Claes de Vreese.",,,,,,,,,,"Althaus, S.L., Tewksbury, D.H., (2007) Toward a new generation of media use measures for the ANES, , http://www.electionstudies.org/Library/papers/Pilot2006/nes011903.pdf, Report nes011903.

The methodology is demonstrated by combining the following three data sets collected from a widely tested eHealth system, the Comprehensive Health Enhancement Support System (CHESS): (1) a flexible and precise computer-aided content analysis; (2) a record of individual message posting and reading; and (3) longitudinal survey data. Further, this article discusses how the resulting data can be applied to online social network analysis and demonstrates how to construct two distinct types of online social networks—open and targeted communication networks—for different types of content embedded in social networks. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,"National Cancer Institute, NCI: P50 CA095817-05",National Cancer Institute (P50 CA095817-05).,,"Alpers, G.W., Winzelberg, A.J., Classen, C., Roberts, H., Dev, P., Koopman, C., Taylor, C.B., Evaluation of computerized text analysis in an Internet breast cancer support group (2005) Computers in Human Behavior, 21, pp. 361-376; Baker, T., Hawkins, R.P., Pingree, S., Roberts, L., McDowell, H., Shaw, B., Optimizing eHealth breast cancer interventions: Which types of eHealth services are effective?

However, the consequences of measurement error in coding data are rarely discussed or taken into consideration in subsequent analyses. In this article, we demonstrate how misclassification in content analysis leads to biased estimates and introduce matrix back-calculation as a simple remedy. Using Monte Carlo simulation, we investigate how different ways of collecting information about the misclassification process influence the effectiveness of error correction under varying conditions. The results show that error correction with an adequate set-up can often substantially reduce bias. We conclude with an illustrative example, extensions of the procedure, and some recommendations. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Bauman, K.E., Koch, G.G., Validity of self-reports and descriptive and analytical conclusions: The case of cigarette smoking by adolescents and their mothers (1983) American Journal of Epidemiology, 118 (1), pp. 90-98; Benoit, K.R., Conway, D., Lauderdale, B.E., Laver, M., Mikhaylov, S., Crowd-sourced text analysis: Reproducible and agile production of political data (2016) American Political Science Review, 110 (2), pp. 278-295; Bross, I., Misclassification in 2 X 2 tables (1954) Biometrics, 10 (4), pp. 478-486; Buonaccorsi, J.P., (2010) Measurement error: Models, methods, and applications, , Boca Raton, FL: CRC Press; Grimmer, J., King, G., Superti, C., (2015), http://stanford.edu/~jgrimmer/Handbib.pdf, The unreliability of measures of intercoder reliability, and what to do about it.

CROS is a new variable previously conceptualized as a perceived inability to communicate about a particular stressor within an organizational context and operationalized as having two dimensions of prevalence and distress. The present investigation presents data from two studies (total N = 918) aimed at developing and validating a measure of CROS. In Study 1, we generated and tested a series of items intended to tap into the dual dimensions of CROS with currently employed organizational members (n = 373). In Study 2, we collected a second sample (n = 545) and confirmed the factor structure of the measure identified in Study 1. We present evidence of reliability, content validity, and construct validity. The final result is a two-dimensional measure of CROS we call the CROS-14. Our discussion includes information on implementation, scoring, and potential future applications of the CROS-14. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,"Santa Clara University, SCU","The authors would like to thank Paul Mongeau, Todd Lee Goen, Mark Hamilton, and Katharine Heintz for their assistance.

RJs are advantageous because they eliminate the need for expensive detection equipment and only require minimal training for coders with relatively accurate judgments. Results of testing on two different datasets showed that trained coders were reliably making RJs after watching both long and short interaction segments but their judgments were not more accurate than the expert interviewers. The RJs did not discriminate between truth and deception as hypothesized. This raises more questions about the conditions under which making RJs from verbal and nonverbal cues achieves accurate detection of veracity. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Aamodt, M.G., Custer, H., Who can best catch a liar?

Mediated associations are defined as the repeated pairing of an object (e.g., social group, political party) with specific attributes (e.g., crime, economy). In this article, we introduce a recently developed, automated text-analytic technique. We present an application of this method in the media stereotyping domain via the content analysis of German news coverage of Islam. As predicted, the analysis revealed substantial mediated associations between Islam-related concepts and violence (e.g., “Koran + violence”), terror (e.g., “Islam + terror”), dehumanization (e.g., “Muslims + animal-related terms”), and general negativity (valence). We discuss the promises and pitfalls of this method, make software suggestions, and provide application-related information for speedy dissemination in communication research. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Carley, K.M., Network text analysis: The network position of concepts (1997) Text analysis for the social sciences.

Good recall of past viewing was predicted due to two robust memory capabilities, specifically, high accuracy at estimating frequency of exposure to stimuli, and durable long-term memories for repeatedly-encountered material. Validity was tested by examining relationships between self-reported childhood TV viewing and current aggression. Results indicated that recalled childhood viewing of programs containing violent content was positively related to adult aggressive behavior directly, and aggressive cognitions indirectly, independently of adult exposure to violent TV programs, exposure to nonviolent TV programs, parental disciplinary style, and sex. A valid self-report measure of remote past TV viewing behavior can enable researchers to examine, in a relatively quick and inexpensive manner, long-term relationships between early viewing of any television content and any later psychological outcomes of interest. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Anderson, C.A., Bartholow, B.D., Cantor, J., Burgess, M., Cantor, J., Brockmyer, J.F., Warburton, W., Consensus on media violence effects: Comment on Bushman, Gollwitzer, and Cruz (2015) (2015) Psychology of Popular Media Culture, 4, pp. 215-221; Anderson, C.A., Berkowitz, L., Donnerstein, E., Huesmann, L.R., Johnson, J.D., Linz, D., Wartella, E., The influence of media violence on youth (2003) Psychological Science in the Public Interest, 4, pp. 81-110; Anderson, C.A., Bushman, B.J., Human aggression (2002) Annual Review of Psychology, 53, pp. 27-51; Anderson, C.A., Huesmann, L.R., Human aggression: A social-cognitive view (2003) Handbook of social psychology: Concise student edition, , Hogg M.A., Cooper J., (eds), London, UK: Sage; Anderson, C.A., Gentile, D.A., Buckley, K.E., (2007) Violent video game effects on children and adolescents: Theory, research, and public policy, , New York, NY: Oxford University Press; Anderson, D.R., Huston, A.C., Schmitt, K., Linebarger, D.L., Wright, J.C., Early childhood television viewing and adolescent behavior: The recontact study (2001) Monographs of the Society for Research in Child Development, 66, pp. 1-147; Anderson, M.C., Neely, J.H., Interference and inhibition in memory retrieval (1996) Memory.

The erosion of trust in the press as measured by the GSS indicator is indisputable, but its implications for the functioning of American democracy depend on what, precisely, is being measured. In this study we use an experimental design embedded in a representative national probability sample to shed light on what people are thinking of when they say they trust or distrust the American press. Are they thinking about the sources they themselves use for news? The sources that are most popular with the population at large? An average of all possible media sources? We find that individuals express much greater trust in the press when they are asked to consider specific news sources than when they are asked to evaluate a generic news media. Our results suggest that an accessibility bias combined with the proliferation of news sources in recent years may lead individuals to think of distrusted sources when asked to answer generic media trust questions. We therefore argue that different measurement strategies are needed to successfully address trust in the press in the current news environment. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Bertrand, M., Mullainathan, S., Do people mean what they say?

When the independent variable X and moderator M are dichotomous or continuous, the practice of testing a linear moderation hypothesis using regression analysis by including the product of X and M in a model of dependent variable Y is widespread. However, many research designs include multicategorical independent variables or moderators, such as in an experiment with three or more versions of a stimulus where participants are randomly assigned to one of them. Researchers are less likely to receive training about how to properly test a moderation hypothesis using regression analysis in such a situation. In this tutorial, we explain how to test, visualize, and probe interactions involving a multicategorical variable using linear regression analysis. While presenting and discussing the fundamentals—fundamentals that are not software specific—we emphasize the use of the PROCESS macro for SPSS and SAS, as it greatly simplifies the computations and potential for error that exists when doing computations by hand or using spreadsheets based on formulas in existing books on this topic. We also introduce an iterative computational implementation of the Johnson-Neyman technique for finding regions of significance of the effect of a multicategorical independent variable when the moderator is continuous. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Aguinis, H., Pierce, C.A., Heterogeneity of error variance and the assessment of moderating effects of categorical variables: A conceptual review (1998) Organizational Research Methods, 1, pp. 296-314; Bauer, D.J., Curran, P.J., Probing interactions in fixed and multilevel regression: Inferential and graphical techniques (2005) Multivariate Behavioral Research, 40, pp. 373-400; Berry, W.D., (1993) Understanding regression assumptions, , Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage Publications; Berry, W.D., Golder, M., Milton, D., Improving tests of theories positing interaction (2012) Journal of Politics, 74, pp. 653-671; Beullens, K., Rhodes, N., Eggermont, S., Behavioral activation and inhibition as moderators of the relationship between music video-viewing and joyriding attitudes (2016) Media Psychology, 19, pp. 181-202; Burden, R.L., Faires, J.D., (1985) Numerical analysis, , 3rd, Boston, MA: Prindle, Weber, & Schmidt; Cohen, J., Cohen, P., West, S.G., Aiken, L.S., (2003) Applied multiple regression and correlation for the behavioral sciences, , 3rd, Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates; Darlington, R.B., Hayes, A.F., (2017) Regression analysis and linear models: Concepts, applications, and implementation, , New York, NY: The Guilford Press; Eveland, W.P., Interactions and nonlinearity in mass communication: Connecting theory and methodology (1997) Journalism and Mass Communication Quarterly, 74, pp. 400-416; Gabbiadini, A., Riva, P., Andrighetto, L., Volpato, C., Bushman, B.J., Acting like a tough guy: Violent-sexist video games, identification with game characters, masculine beliefs, and empathy for female violence victims (2016) Plos One, 11 (4), pp. 1-14; Feldman, L., Hart, P.S., Using political efficacy messages to increase climate activism: The mediating role of emotions (2016) Science Communication, 38, pp. 99-127; Gelman, A., Stern, H., The difference between “significant” and “not significant” is not itself statistically significant (2006) American Statistician, 60, pp. 328-331; Habush, A., Warren, C.S., Benuto, L., Beauty, ethnicity, and age: Does internalization of mainstream media ideals influence attitudes toward older adults?

However, little attention has been paid to the criteria viewers use when they evaluate a movie or its specific features. Adding to this, the present research introduces the idea of subjective movie evaluation criteria (SMEC), conceptualizes SMEC as the mental representation of important attitudes toward specific film features, and describes the scale construction for their measurement and its validation process. Findings from pilot work and 2 studies including over 1,500 participants provide first evidence that 8 dimensions—Story Verisimilitude, Story Innovation, Cinematography, Special Effects, Recommendation, Innocuousness, Light-heartedness, and Cognitive Stimulation—are largely determined by stable individual differences, substantially but differentially related to film-specific constructs and personality traits, and that the SMEC scales are reliable and valid instruments for measuring subjective movie evaluation criteria. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Augustin, M.D., Leder, H., Art expertise: A study of concepts and conceptual spaces (2006) Psychology Science, 48, pp. 135-156; Austin, B.A., Motivations for movie attendance (1986) Communication Quarterly, 34, pp. 115-126; Bartsch, A., Schneider, F.M., Entertainment and politics revisited: How non-escapist forms of entertainment can stimulate political interest and information seeking (2014) Journal of Communication, 64, pp. 369-396; Bartsch, A., Vorderer, P., Mangold, R., Viehoff, R., Appraisal of emotions in media use: Toward a process model of meta-emotion and emotion regulation (2008) Media Psychology, 11, pp. 7-27; Bentler, P.M., Wu, E.J.C., (2005) EQS 6 structural equations program manual, , http://www.mvsoft.com, Encino, CA: Multivariate Software, Retrieved from; Bless, H., Wänke, M., Bohner, G., Fellhauer, R.F., Schwarz, N., Need for cognition: Eine Skala zur Erfassung von Engagement und Freude bei Denkaufgaben [Need for cognition: A scale measuring engagement and happiness in cognitive tasks] (1994) Zeitschrift Für Sozialpsychologie, 25, pp. 147-154; Boninger, D.S., Krosnick, J.A., Berent, M.K., Fabrigar, L.R., The causes and consequences of attitude importance (1995) Attitude strength: Antecedents and consequences, , Petty R.E., Krosnick J.A., (eds), Hillsdale, NJ: Erlbaum; Brown, T.A., (2006) Confirmatory factor analysis for applied research, , New York, NY: Guilford Press; Browne, M.W., An overview of analytic rotation in exploratory factor analysis (2001) Multivariate Behavioral Research, 36, pp. 111-150; Browne, M.W., Cudeck, R., Tateneni, K., Mels, G., (2010) CEFA: Comprehensive Exploratory Factor Analysis (Version 3.04), , http://faculty.psy.ohio-state.edu/browne/, Retrieved from; Burisch, M., Approaches to personality inventory construction: A comparison of merits (1984) American Psychologist, 39, pp. 214-227; Cacioppo, J.T., Petty, R.E., The need for cognition (1982) Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 42, pp. 116-131; Carroll, N.E., (2003) Engaging the moving image, , New Haven, CT: Yale University Press; Cattell, R.B., Psychological theory and scientific method (1988) Handbook of multivariate experimental psychology, , Nesselroade J.R., Cattell R.B., (eds), 2nd ed., New York, NY: Plenum Press; Chamorro-Premuzic, T., Kallias, A., Hsu, A., What type of movie person are you?

We present a new methodological approach that is based on the open-source web analytics software Piwik. This method allows for the tracking of selective exposure and facilitates the integration of selective exposure data with online survey data. To ease data handling, we created a plug-in turning Piwik into a scientific research tool. After discussing the theoretical and methodological background of collecting data on user selections, we provide step-by-step instructions on the integration of Piwik with online content, survey software, and the merging of tracking and survey data. Finally, we discuss research applications, advantages, and limitations of the new research tool. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.",,,,,,,,,,"Arceneaux, K., Johnson, M., (2013) Changing minds or changing channels: Partisan news in an age of choice; Bakshy, E., Messing, S., Adamic, L.A., Exposure to ideologically diverse news and opinion on Facebook (2015) Science, 348 (6239), pp. 1130-1132; Best, S.J., Chmielewski, B., Krueger, B.S., Selective exposure to online foreign news during the conflict with Iraq (2005) The Harvard International Journal of Press/Politics, 10 (4), pp. 52-70; Bruns, A., (2005) Gatewatching: Collaborative online news production, , New York: Peter Lang; Bruns, A., (2008) Blogs, Wikipedia, Second Life, and beyond: From production to produsage, , New York, NY: Peter Lang; Bryant, J., Davies, J., Selective exposure (2008) The international encyclopedia of communication, , Donsbach W., (ed), Malden, MA: Wiley-Blackwell; Bryant, J., Zillmann, D., Using television to alleviate boredom and stress: Selective exposure as a function of induced excitational states (1984) Journal of Broadcasting, 28 (1), pp. 1-20; Clay, R., Barber, J.M., Shook, N.J., Techniques for measuring selective exposure: A critical review (2013) Communication Methods and Measures, 7 (3-4), pp. 147-171; Dahlgren, P., The Internet, public spheres, and political communication: Dispersion and deliberation (2005) Political Communication, 22 (2), pp. 147-162; Diab, L.N., Voluntary exposure to information during and after the war in Lebanon (1979) The Journal of Social Psychology, 108 (1), pp. 13-17; Dilliplane, S., All the news you want to hear: The impact of partisan news exposure on political participation (2011) Public Opinion Quarterly, 75 (2), pp. 287-316; Dillman Carpentier, F., Knobloch, S., Zillmann, D., Rock, rap, and rebellion: Comparisons of traits predicting selective exposure to defiant music (2003) Personality and Individual Differences, 35 (7), pp. 1643-1655; Drew, D., Weaver, D., Voter learning in the 2004 presidential election: Did the media matter?

Coding is essential to content analysis and social research, including computational linguistics, which concern interpretations of meaningful matter. The usual protocol calls for observers or readers to categorize, scale, or measure each of a given set of predefined units of analysis, in effect characterizing them by one value from each variable of analytical interest. However, there are many occasions in which texts and nonverbal phenomena have multiple interpretations. Until now, there has been no practical way to measure their reliability. This paper proposes a coefficient to measure the reliability of multi-valued data. It adds to Krippendorff’s family of alpha coefficients, briefly reviewed. We offer a motivation for using the new coefficient, develop it mathematically, exemplify its computation, explore its behavior, and provide access to open source software to compute its most simple case. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.",,,,,,,,,,"Aleven, V., Popescu, O., Koedinger, K., Pilot-testing a tutorial dialogue system that supports self-explanation (2002) Proceedings of the sixth international conference on intelligent tutoring systems, ITS 2002, , Cerri S.A., Gouardères G., Paraguaçu F., (eds), Berlin, Germany: Springer; Artstein, R., Poesio, M., Inter-coder agreement for computational linguistics (Survey article) (2008) Computational Linguistics, 34 (4), pp. 555-596; Berelson, B., (1952) Content analysis in communications research, , New York, NY: Free Press; Best, M.L., Models for interacting populations of memes: Competition and niche behavior (1997) Journal of Memetics—Evolutionary Models of Information Transmission, 1. , http://www.cfpm.org/jom-emit/1997/vol1/best_ml.html, Retrieved, February, 2016, from; Best, M.L., An ecology of text: Memes, Competition, and niche behavior (2009) The content analysis reader, , Krippendorff K., Bock M.A., (eds), Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage; Brennan, R.L., Prediger, D.J., Coefficient kappa: Some uses, misuses, and alternatives (1981) Educational and Psychological Measurement, 41 (3), pp. 687-699; Brower, M., Clark, C.C., Eleey, M.F., Gerbner, G., Krippendorff, K., The television world of violence. & Content analysis procedures and results (1969) Mass media and violence, Vol. IX.

While most frame-building studies focus on the relative contribution of journalists or sources to news frames, this article presents and evaluates an integrated methodological model. The model is based on constructionist premises with the purpose of examining how frames are created as part of the interaction among reporters, editors, and sources. Based on a review of the methodologies used in earlier frame-building studies, we propose an ethnographic four-phase model in which multiple methods are interwoven: newsroom observations, reconstruction interviews, and frame analyses of news products (which illustrate what is made salient) as well as production documents (which also reveal what is silenced). The model is illustrated with two multisited studies in newspaper newsrooms: an interview-based study of the news reports of preselected journalists and an observation-based study for which the news reports to be analyzed were selected based on their salience in newsroom meetings. Through this multimethod model, this paper offers some guidelines for the study of frame building from a journalistic perspective. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.",,,,,,,,,,"Bartholomé, G., Lecheler, S., de Vreese, C., Manufacturing conflict?

With this purpose, the present research relates to the recent rise of entertainment research, embracing more and more media types and formats with which entertainment experiences may occur. At the same time, it addresses a methodological issue that has rarely been addressed in communication research. Focusing on one of the most often used measurement instruments in entertainment research, on three different media formats (political talk shows, comedies, and dramas), the study finds evidence for configural, metric, and scalar invariance for the scale.

While self-reported measures remain dominant in the field, alternative approaches such as exogenous or hybrid measures have received increasing scholarly attention and been employed in various contexts for the estimation of media exposure; however, systematic scrutiny of such measures is thin. This study aims to address the gap by systematically reviewing the studies which utilized exogenous or hybrid exposure measures for examining the effects of media exposure on tobacco-related outcomes. We then proceed to discuss the strengths and weaknesses, current developments in this class of measurement, drawing some implications for the appropriate utilization of exogenous and hybrid measures. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.",,,,,,,"National Cancer Institute, NCI

The argument: using social media to deliver specific campaign messages to a large targeted audience is hard, and measurement of exposure will be more demanding than with conventional media sources. In contrast, when the goal is to capture exposure to information in the pubic communication environment, “big data” based content analyses of social media streams may be a valuable approach; still there is much more work to do to establish the validity of these approaches and their usefulness in accounting for behavior. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.",,,,,,,,,,"Cole-Lewis, H., Varghese, A., Sanders, A., Schwarz, M., Pugatch, J., Augustson, E., Assessing electronic cigarette-related tweets for sentiment and content using supervised machine learning (2015) Journal of Medical Internet Research, 16 (8); Depue, J.B., Southwell, B.G., Betzner, A.E., Walsh, B.M., Encoded exposure to tobacco use in social media predicts subsequent smoking behavior (2015) American Journal of Health Promotion, 29 (4), pp. 259-261; Kelly, B.J., Niederdeppe, J., Hornik, R.C., Validating measures of scanned information exposure in the context of cancer prevention and screening behaviors (2009) Journal of Health Communication, 14 (8), pp. 721-740; Ruths, D., Pfeffer, J., Social media for large studies of behavior (2014) Science, 346 (6213), pp. 1063-1064; Stryker, J.E., Wray, R.J., Hornik, R.C., Yanovitzky, I., Validation of database search terms for content analysis: The case of cancer news coverage (2006) Journalism & Mass Communication Quarterly, 83 (2), pp. 413-430","Hornik, R.; Annenberg School for Communication, University of Pennsylvania, 3620 Walnut Street, United States; email: rhornik@asc.upenn.edu",,,Routledge,,,,,19312458,,,,English,Commun.

Instead, we apply an under-utilized method—corneal eye tracking—for gauging attention to content in social media. We expose subjects to different types of Facebook content and track their gaze as they browse through posts. Substantively, we find that news and social content garner equal attention, with politics trailing behind both. We also find that the style of the post matters for attention patterns, with richer content (e.g., pictures, links) enhancing attention especially for social and news posts. Methodologically, we conclude that participants are unable to accurately report the topics and types of content available on the Facebook feed, even immediately after exposure. We discuss the implications of these findings and also make recommendations for appropriate methods in this area. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.",,,,,,,George Mason University,Funding for this paper was provided by George Mason University,,"Anderson, M., More Americans are using social media to connect with politicians (2015) Pew Research Center, , http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2015/05/19/more-americans-are-using-social-media-to-connect-with-politicians/, Retrieved from; Bakshy, E., Messing, S., Adamic, L., Exposure to ideologically diverse news and opinion on Facebook (2015) Science, 348 (6239), pp. 1130-1132; Barthel, M., Shearer, E., Gottfried, J., Mitchell, A., The evolving role of news on Twitter and Facebook (2015) Pew Research Center, , http://www.journalism.org/2015/07/14/the-evolving-role-of-news-on-twitter-and-facebook/, Retrieved from; Bode, L., Facebooking it to the polls: A study in online social networking and political behavior (2012) Journal of Information Technology & Politics, 9 (4), pp. 352-369; Bode, L., Political news in the news feed: Learning politics from social media (2015) Mass Communication and Society, 19 (1), pp. 24-48; Bode, L., Vraga, E.K., Borah, P., Shah, D.V., A new space for political behavior: Political social networking and its democratic consequences (2014) Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication, 19 (3), pp. 414-429; Bradburn, N.M., Rips, L., Shevell, S., Answering autobiographical questions: The impact of memory and inference on surveys (1987) Science, 236, pp. 157-161; Bryant, J., Thompson, S., Finklea, B., (2012) Fundamentals of media effects, , 2nd ed., Waveland Press, Inc.

The more information that researchers capture about such content, the more meaningful inferences about effects can be. Therefore, approaches to media effects research in which researchers first analyze the content of interest and then study impact of exposure to instances of such content has much to recommend them. One such approach is to analyze content to which a given population is likely to be exposed and then, in a survey, identify which instances of that content the respondent has (or likely has) seen. Another approach is to identify differences in media content (ideally identified via content analysis) by geographic unit, and use multi-level analyses to look at associated or prospective differences in outcomes. Another approach is via experiment: experimenters can characterize populations of messages via content analysis, and can sample either message exemplars of particular interest to manipulate in fixed effect designs, or create random samples of types of messages to represent message differences using random effect, multi-level analyses. Such approaches can substantially increase strength of inference, support rigorous test of theory, and increase external validity and policy relevance. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.",,,,,,,,,,"Brown, J.D., L’Engle, K.L., Pardun, C.J., Guo, G., Kenneavy, K., Jackson, C., Sexy media matter: Exposure to sexual content in music, movies, television, and magazines predicts black and white adolescents’ sexual behavior (2006) Pediatrics, 117 (4), pp. 1018-1027; Dalton, M.A., Sargent, J.D., Beach, M.L., Titus-Ernstoff, L., Gibson, J.J., Ahrens, M.B., Heatherton, T.F., Effect of viewing smoking in movies on adolescent smoking initiation: A cohort study (2003) The Lancet, 362 (9380), pp. 281-285; Farrelly, M.C., Davis, K.C., Haviland, M.L., Messeri, P., Healton, C.G., Evidence of a dose-response relationship between “truth” antismoking ads and youth smoking prevalence (2005) American Journal of Public Health, 95 (3), pp. 425-431; Goodall, C.E., Myers, T.A., Slater, M.D., (2016) Audience and message variables moderating emotional reactions to local news coverage of alcohol-related crimes, accidents, and injuries: Explaining news effects on policy support, , Manuscript in preparation; Goodall, C.E., Slater, M.D., Myers, T.A., Fear and anger responses to local news coverage of alcohol-related crimes, accidents, and injuries: Explaining news effects on policy support using a representative sample of messages and people (2013) Journal of Communication, 63 (2), pp. 373-392; Palmgreen, P., Donohew, L., Lorch, E.P., Hoyle, R.H., Stephenson, M.T., Television campaigns and adolescent marijuana use: Tests of sensation seeking targeting (2001) American Journal of Public Health, 91 (2), pp. 292-296; Peter, J., Country characteristics as contingent conditions of agenda setting: The moderating influence of polarized elite opinion (2003) Communication Research, 30 (6), pp. 683-712; Peter, J., Our long ‘return to the concept of powerful mass media’— A cross-national comparative investigation of the effects of consonant media coverage (2004) International Journal of Public Opinion Research, 16 (2), pp. 144-168; Shah, D.V., Watts, M.D., Domke, D., Fan, D.P., News framing and cueing of issue regimes: Explaining Clinton’s public approval in spite of scandal (2002) Public Opinion Quarterly, 66 (3), pp. 339-370; Slater, M.D., Operationalizing and analyzing exposure: The foundation of media effects research (2004) Journalism & Mass Communication Quarterly, 81 (1), pp. 168-183; Slater, M.D., Content analysis as a foundation for programmatic research in communication (2013) Communication Methods and Measures, 7 (2), pp. 85-93; Slater, M.D., Peter, J., Valkenburg, P.M., Message variability and heterogeneity: A core challenge for communication research (2015) Communication Yearbook 39, pp. 3-32. , Cohen E.L., (ed), New York: Routledge; Snyder, L.B., Milici, F.F., Slater, M., Sun, H., Strizhakova, Y., Effects of alcohol advertising exposure on drinking among youth (2006) Archives of Pediatrics & Adolescent Medicine, 160 (1), pp. 18-24; van Spanje, J., de Vreese, C., Europhile media and Eurosceptic voting: effects of news media coverage on Eurosceptic Voting in the 2009 European parliamentary elections (2014) Political Communication, 31 (2), pp. 325-354; Wakefield, M., Terry-McElrath, Y., Emery, S., Saffer, H., Chaloupka, F.J., Szczypka, G., Johnston, L.D., Effect of televised, tobacco company-funded smoking prevention advertising on youth smoking-related beliefs, intentions, and behavior (2006) American Journal of Public Health, 96 (12), pp. 2154-2160; Yanovitzky, I., Stryker, J., Mass media, social norms, and health promotion efforts: A longitudinal study of media effects on youth binge drinking (2001) Communication Research, 28 (2), pp. 208-239","Slater, M.D.; School of Communication, The Ohio State University, 3022 Derby Hall, United States; email: slater.59@osu.edu",,,Routledge,,,,,19312458,,,,English,Commun.

This calls for new approaches to measuring media exposure. This study applies an innovative approach to survey (n = 2378) exposure to political information in the form of a mobile diary measurement, accessible via a specifically developed app. Respondents exhibited broad acceptance and uptake of the mobile measurement, resulting in an almost representative sample and equally satisfactory application of different platform modes. The study furthermore confirms limitations of mere usage time measurements of social media platforms in effects research and explores a range of actual content types that citizens encounter in social networks. It recommends more frequent use of mobile exposure measurements and argues for a content-related assessment of social media use in effects research. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.",,,,,,,,,,"Baker, R., Blumberg, S.J., Brick, J.M., Couper, M.P., Courtright, M., Dennis, J.M., Zahs, D., Research synthesis: AAPOR report on online panels (2010) Public Opinion Quarterly, 74 (4), pp. 711-781; Bennett, W.L., Iyengar, S., A new era of minimal effects?

The growing supply of outlets and proliferation of information sources have added an additional level of complexity to these problems. Reflecting on old and new approaches for measuring exposure to political information, it is argued that both the specific source and the frequency of exposure must be taken into account. The validity of this so-called “list-frequency technique” is tested using a two-wave panel survey as well as a split sample experiment from the survey pre-test to enable comparison with the “list technique.” The results support the list-frequency technique in being a good solution, since it provides the same aggregate estimates of media use as the already validated list technique, and may give more detailed effect estimates and increase the explained variance when predicting political knowledge. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.",,,,,,,,,,"Alwin, D.F., Krosnick, J.A., The reliability of survey attitude measurement: The influence of question and respondent attributes (1991) Sociological Methods & Research, 20 (1), pp. 139-181; Appel, V., Length of screening interval and print media audience estimates (1994) Journal of Advertising Research, 34 (5), pp. 22-26; Bartels, L.M., Messages received: The political impact of media exposure (1993) The American Political Science Review, 87, pp. 267-285; Brown, M., (1990) Dear reader.

First, I argue that people will be increasingly unable to recall and accurately report on the source of their information exposure in surveys, although they have never been very good at this to begin with. Many surveys seeking to gauge media processes and effects continue to assume respondents' abilities to identify and recall the precise source of information exposure, but the speed, dynamism and participatory nature of media diffusion in the digital age will render these recollections less meaningful than ever before. Second, I suggest that researchers should consider making more effective use of time as a critical source of variation in efforts to gauge communication exposure moving forward. Specifically, research designs that are able to accurately capture large-scale changes in the availability of specific media messages over time, and link this variation to repeated observations of individual attitudes and behavior, should be well positioned to study media effects and processes in the digital age. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.",,,,,,,,,,"Althaus, S.L., Kim, Y.M., Priming effects in complex information environments: Reassessing the impact of news discourse on presidential approval (2006) The Journal of Politics, 68 (4), pp. 960-976; Hovland, C.I., Lumsdaine, A.A., Sheffield, F.D., (1949) Experiments on mass communication, , Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press; Kumkale, G.T., Albarracín, D., The sleeper effect in persuasion: A meta-analytic review (2004) Psychological Bulletin, 130 (1), pp. 143-172; Niederdeppe, J., Conceptual, empirical, and practical issues in developing valid measures of public communication campaign exposure (2014) Communication Methods and Measures, 8 (2), pp. 138-161; Niederdeppe, J., Frosch, D., News coverage and sales of products with trans fats: Effects before and after changes in federal labeling policy (2009) American Journal of Preventive Medicine, 36 (5), pp. 395-401; Noar, S.M., Ribisl, K.M., Althouse, B.M., Willoughby, J.F., Ayers, J.W., Using digital surveillance to examine the impact of public figure pancreatic cancer announcements on media and search query outcomes (2013) Journal of the National Cancer Institute Monographs, 47, pp. 188-194; Romantan, A., Hornik, R., Price, V., Cappella, J., Viswanath, K., A comparative analysis of the performance of alternative measures of exposure (2008) Communication Methods and Measures, 2 (1-2), pp. 80-99; Smith, K.C., Niederdeppe, J., Blake, K., Cappella, J.N., Advancing cancer control research in an emerging news media environment (2013) Journal of the National Cancer Institute Monographs, 47, pp. 175-181; Wakefield, M.A., Durkin, S., Spittal, M.J., Siahpush, M., Scollo, M., Simpson, J.A., Hill, D., Impact of tobacco control policies and mass media campaigns on monthly adult smoking prevalence (2008) American Journal of Public Health, 98 (8), pp. 1443-1450","Niederdeppe, J.; Department of Communication, Cornell University, 476 Mann Building, 4th Floor, United States; email: jdn56@cornell.edu",,,Routledge,,,,,19312458,,,,English,Commun.

Some researchers have focused on the effects of variously worded self-report measures. Others advocate the use of aggregate and/or behavioral data that does not rely on a person’s ability to accurately recall exposure. Our study illustrates how an experimental design can be used to improve measures of exposure. In particular, we show how an experimental benchmark can be employed to (1) compare actual (i.e., manipulated) and self-reported values of news exposure; (2) assess how closely the self-reported items approximate the performance of “true” exposure in an empirical application; and (3) investigate whether a variation in question wording improves the accuracy of self-reported exposure measures. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.",,,,,,,,,,"Althaus, S.L., Tewksbury, D.H., Toward a new generation of media use measures for the ANES (2007) Report to the Board of Overseers, American National Election Studies.

Today’s media landscape, in which individuals are exposed to a diversity of messages anytime, anywhere, and from a great variety of sources on an increasing number of different media platforms, has complicated the measurement of media exposure even more. However, today’s digital media landscape also offers new possibilities to map media exposure by means of passive measurement. In this Introduction article to the special issue, we give an overview of the different ways in which media exposure is measured and the various issues associated with their applications. We conclude with a research agenda for issues that need to be tackled in future research and also introduce a research tool for media exposure measurement. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.",,,,,,,,,,"Combining content analysis and assessment of exposure through self-report, spatial, or temporal variation in media effects research (2016) Communication Methods and Measures, 10 (2-3), pp. 173-175; Althaus, S.L., Tewksbury, D.H., (2007) Toward a new generation of media use measures for the ANES, , http://www.electionstudies.org/resources/papers/Pilot2006/nes011903.pdf, (Report No. nes011903), Retrieved from American National Election Studies; Andersen, K., Albaek, E., de Vreese, C.H., Measuring media diet in a high-choice environment: Testing the list-frequency technique (2016) Communication Methods and Measures, 10 (2-3), pp. 81-98; Appel, V., Weinstein, S., Weinstein, C., Brain activity and recall of TV advertising (1979) Journal of Advertising Research, 19 (4), pp. 7-18; Araujo, T., Neijens, P.C., Vliegenthart, R., What motivates consumers to re-tweet brand content?

This complexity calls for a more nuanced method of quantifying media consumption that goes beyond the binary like-minded or cross-cutting categories currently used in studies of selective exposure. We develop a measure that captures the full diversity of content in an individual’s media diet, the media diet imbalance score, by adapting Brader, Tucker, and Therriault’s (2014) measure of sociodemographic cross-pressures. Our method allows for research on important aspects of the current media environment that are impossible with existing measures, and it is less labor intensive than previous strategies for measuring selective exposure. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.",,,,,,,,,,"Brader, T., Tucker, J.A., Therriault, A., Cross pressure scores: An individual-level measure of cumulative partisan pressures arising from social group memberships (2014) Political Behavior, 36 (1), pp. 23-51; Dilliplane, S., All the news you want to hear: The impact of partisan news exposure on political participation (2011) Public Opinion Quarterly, 75 (2), pp. 287-316; Dilliplane, S., Goldman, S.K., Mutz, D.C., Televised exposure to politics: New measures for a fragmented media environment (2013) American Journal of Political Science, 57 (1), pp. 236-248; Garrett, R.K., Politically motivated reinforcement seeking: Reframing the selective exposure debate (2009) Journal of Communication, 59 (4), pp. 676-699; Gentzkow, M., Shapiro, J.M., Media bias and reputation (2006) Journal of Political Economy, 114 (2), pp. 280-316; Groseclose, T., Milyo, J., A measure of media bias (2005) The Quarterly Journal of Economics, 120 (4), pp. 1191-1237; Mullainathan, S., Shleifer, A., The market for news (2005) American Economic Review, 95 (4), pp. 1031-1053; (2008) The color of news: How different media have covered the general election.

Previous research has shown that the accuracy of these self-report measures can be quite low, and both over- and underreporting of media use are commonplace. This study compares self-reports of Internet use with client log files from a large household sample. Results show that the accuracy of self-reported frequency and duration of Internet use is quite low, and that survey data are only moderately correlated with log file data. Moreover, there are systematic patterns of misreporting, especially overreporting, rather than random deviations from the log files. Self-reports for specific content such as social network sites or video platforms seem to be more accurate and less consistently biased than self-reports of generic frequency or duration of Internet use. The article closes by demonstrating the consequences of biased self-reports and discussing possible solutions to the problem. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.",,,,,,,,,,"Abeele, M.V., Beullens, K., Roe, K., Measuring mobile phone use: Gender, age and real usage level in relation to the accuracy and validity of self-reported mobile phone use (2013) Mobile Media & Communication, 1 (2), pp. 213-236; Adamic, L.A., Huberman, B.A., The web’s hidden order (2001) Communications of the ACM, 44 (9), pp. 55-60; Allen, R.L., The reliability and stability of television exposure (1981) Communication Research, 8 (2), pp. 233-256; Blalock, H.M., A causal approach to nonrandom measurement errors (1970) The American Political Science Review, 64 (4), pp. 1099-1111; Boase, J., Ling, R., Measuring mobile phone use: Self-report versus log data (2013) Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication, 18 (4), pp. 508-519; Bollen, K.A., Latent variables in psychology and the social sciences (2002) Annual Review of Psychology, 53 (1), pp. 605-634; Campbell, D.T., Fiske, D.W., Convergent and discriminant validation by the multitrait-multimethod matrix (1959) Psychological Bulletin, 56 (2), pp. 81-105; Cook, J.R., Stefanski, L.A., Simulation-extrapolation estimation in parametric measurement error models (1994) Journal of the American Statistical Association, 89 (428), pp. 1314-1328; Coromina, L., Saris, W.E., Quality of media use measurement (2009) International Journal of Public Opinion Research, 21 (4), pp. 424-450; Diamantopoulos, A., Sarstedt, M., Fuchs, C., Wilczynski, P., Kaiser, S., Guidelines for choosing between multi-item and single-item scales for construct measurement: A predictive validity perspective (2012) Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science, 40 (3), pp. 434-449; Fishbein, M., Hornik, R., Measuring media exposure: An introduction to the special issue (2008) Communication Methods and Measures, 2 (1-2), pp. 1-5; Goulet, L., Hampton, K., (2012) The accuracy of self-reports of social network site use: Comparing survey responses to server logs, , Paper presented at the 2012 ICA conference, Phoenix, AZ; Heise, D.R., (1969) Separating reliability and stability in test-retest correlation, pp. 93-101. , American Sociological Review; Junco, R., Comparing actual and self-reported measures of Facebook use (2013) Computers in Human Behavior, 29 (3), pp. 626-631; Kobayashi, T., Boase, J., No such effect?

Analyzing three types of data (two three-wave panel studies, social network data from 25 intact groups, and a cognitive interview), this paper examines the reliability of (and meaning ascribed to) self-reported political discussion frequency measures. Results of Study 1 and Study 2 suggest that self-report measures of political discussion exhibit strong internal consistency at a given time point, but substandard reliability within individuals over time and between members of a dyad. Study 3 demonstrates substantial variability in survey respondents’ definitions of political discussion, with more expansive definitions of politics related to higher reports of political discussion frequency. Directions for future research to enhance understanding and improve the reliability of political discussion measures are addressed. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.",,,,,,,,,,"(2008) National Annenberg Election Survey 2008 phone edition (NAES08-phone) codebook, , http://www.annenbergpublicpolicycenter.org/political-communication/naes, Retrieved from; (1962) The politics, , (T.

This article proposes a hybrid approach that combines the scale of computational methods with the depth of qualitative analysis. It uses simple natural language processing algorithms to extract purposive samples from large textual corpora, which can then be analyzed using interpretive techniques. This approach helps research become more theoretically grounded and contextually sensitive—two major failings of typical “Big Data” studies. Simultaneously, it allows qualitative scholars to examine datasets that are otherwise too large to study manually and also bring more rigor to the process of sampling. The method is illustrated with two case studies, one looking at the inaugural addresses of U.S. presidents and the other investigating the news coverage of two shootings at an army camp in Texas. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.",,,,,,,,,,"Aiden, E., Michel, J., (2013) Uncharted: Big data as a lens on human culture, , New York, NY: Riverhead; Anderson, C., The end of theory: The data deluge makes the scientific method obsolete (2008) Wired, , http://www.wired.com/2008/06/pb-theory/, June, Retrieved from; Anderson, M., (1988) The American census: A social history, , New Haven, CT: Yale University Press; Andrejevic, M., The Big Data divide (2014) International Journal of Communication, 8, pp. 1673-1689; Special issue: Toward computational social science: Big Data in Digital Environments (2015) The ANNALS of the American Academy of Political and Social Science, 659 (1), pp. 1-318; Barbour, C., Wright, G., (2012) Keeping the republic: Power and citizenship in American politics, , Washington, DC: Congressional Quarterly Press; Berger, J., Army chief concerned for Muslim troops (2009) The New York Times, , http://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/09/us/politics/09casey.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0, November, Retrieved from; Berry, D., The computational turn: Thinking about the digital humanities (2011) Culture Machine, 12. , http://www.culturemachine.net/index.php/cm/article/view/440/470, Retrieved from; Bird, S., Klein, E., Loper, E., (2009) Natural language processing with Python, , http://www.nltk.org/book, Sebastopol, CA: O’Reilly Media, Retrieved from; Blei, D.M., Probabilistic topic models (2012) Communications of the ACM, 55 (4), pp. 77-84; Bollier, D., (2010) The promise and peril of big data, , http://www.aspeninstitute.org/sites/default/files/content/docs/pubs/The_Promise_and_Peril_of_Big_Data.pdf, Washington, DC: Aspen Institute, Retrieved from; Boyd, D., Crawford, K., Critical questions for Big Data (2012) Information, Communication & Society, 15 (5), pp. 662-679; Brady, H.E., Collier, D., (2010) Rethinking social inquiry, , Lanham, MD: Rowman & Littlefield Publishers; Burgess, J., Bruns, A., Hjorth, L., Emerging methods for digital media research: An introduction (2013) Journal of Broadcasting & Electronic Media, 57 (1), pp. 1-3; Burke, K., (1973) The philosophy of literary form: Studies in symbolic action, , Berkeley, CA: University of California Press, Original work published 1941; Campbell, C.P., (1995) Race, myth and the news, , Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage; Campbell, K.K., Jamieson, K.H., Inaugurating the presidency (1985) Presidential Studies Quarterly, 15 (2), pp. 394-411; Ceaser, J., (1979) Presidential selection: Theory and development, , Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press; Ceaser, J., Thurow, G., Tulis, J., Bessette, J., The rise of the rhetorical presidency (1982) Rethinking the presidency, pp. 158-171. , Cronin T., (ed), Boston, MA: Little, Brown and Company; Chandrasekaran, R., Goldman, A., Horwitz, S., 4 dead, 16 wounded in Fort Hood shooting (2014) The Washington Post, , April; Chester, E., Beyond the rhetoric: A new look at presidential inaugural addresses (1980) Presidential Studies Quarterly, 10, pp. 571-578; Chuang, A., Roemer, R.C., The immigrant Muslim American at the boundary of insider and outsider: Representations of Faisal Shahzad as ‘homegrown’ terrorist (2013) Journalism & Mass Communication Quarterly, 90 (1), pp. 89-107; Coffey, A., Holbrook, B., Atkinson, P., Qualitative data analysis: Technologies and representations (1996) Sociological Research Online, 1 (1). , http://www.socresonline.org.uk/1/1/4.html, Retrieved from; Conway, M., The subjective precision of computers: A methodological comparison with human coding in content analysis (2006) Journalism & Mass Communication Quarterly, 83 (1), pp. 186-200; Cornwell, E., (1965) Presidential leadership of public opinion, , Bloomington, IN: Indiana University Press; Crawford, K., Miltner, K., Gray, M.L., Critiquing Big Data: Politics, ethics, epistemology (2014) International Journal of Communication, 8, pp. 1663-1672; Dates, J.L., (1993) Split image: African Americans in the mass media, , Washington, DC: Howard University Press; Davenport, T., (2014) Big data at work: Dispelling the myths, uncovering the opportunities, , Boston, MA: Harvard Business School Publishing; Davis, L.R., Harris, O., Race and ethnicity in U.S. sports media (1998) MediaSport, , Wenner L.A., (ed), London, UK: Routledge; DeCoster, J., Lichtenstein, B., Integrating quantitative and qualitative methods in communication research (2007) Communication Methods and Measures, 1 (4), pp. 227-242; (2015) Special issue: Journalism in an Era of Big Data: Cases, Concepts, and Critiques.

An alternative approach through Bayesian statistics provides various degrees of support for any hypothesis allowing balanced decisions and proper null hypothesis testing, which may prevent publication bias. Testing a null hypothesis becomes increasingly relevant in mediated communication and virtual environments. To illustrate our arguments, we re-analyzed three data sets of previously published data --media violence effects, mediated communication, and visuospatial abilities across genders. Results are discussed in view of possible Bayesian interpretations, which are more open to a content-related argumentation of varying levels of support. Finally, we discuss potential pitfalls of a Bayesian approach such as BF-hacking (cf., “God would love a Bayes Factor of 3.01 nearly as much as a BF of 2.99”). Especially when BF values are small, replication studies and Bayesian updating are still necessary to draw conclusions. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Anderson, C., Dill, K., Video games and aggressive thoughts, feelings and behavior in the laboratory and in life (2000) Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 78, pp. 772-790; Asendorpf, J.B., Conner, M., De Fruyt, F., De Houwer, J., Denissen, J.J.A., Fiedler, K., Wicherts, J.M., Recommendations for increasing replicability in psychology (2013) European Journal of Personality, 27, pp. 108-119; Bakker, M., van Dijk, A., Wicherts, J.M., The rules of the game called psychological science (2012) Perspectives on Psychological Science, 7, pp. 543-554; Bakker, M., Wicherts, J.M., The (mis)reporting of statistical results in psychology journals (2011) Behavior Research Methods, 43 (3), pp. 666-678; Brown, J.D., Bobkowski, P.S., Older and newer media: Patterns of use and effects on adolescents’ health and Well‐Being (2011) Journal of Research on Adolescence, 21 (1), pp. 95-113; Cohen, J., The earth is round (p <.05) (1994) American Psychologist, 49, pp. 997-1003; Fanelli, D., ‘Positive’ results increase down the hierarchy of the sciences (2010) PLoS ONE, 5 (4), p. e10068; Fang, F.C., Steen, R.G., Casadevall, A., Misconduct accounts for the majority of retracted scientific publications (2012) Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences; Ferguson, C.J., Brannick, M.T., Publication bias in psychological science: Prevalence, methods for identifying and controlling and implications for the use of meta-analyses (2012) Psychological Methods, 17 (1), pp. 120-128; Ferguson, C.J., Cruz, A.M., Rueda, S.M., Gender, video game playing habits and visual memory tasks (2008) Sex Roles, 58, pp. 279-286; Ferguson, C.J., Heene, M., A vast graveyard of undead theories: Publication bias and psychological science’s aversion to the null (2012) Perspectives on Psychological Science, 7 (6), pp. 555-561; Fritz, A., Scherndl, T., Kühberger, A., (2012) Correlation between effect size and sample size in psychological research: Sources, consequences, and remedies, , April, Presented at the 10th Conference of the Austrian Psychological Society, Graz, Austria:; Gallistel, C.R., The importance of proving the null (2009) Psychological Review, 116 (2), pp. 439-453; Gollwitzer, M., Melzer, A., Macbeth and the joystick: Evidence for moral cleansing after playing a violent video game (2012) Journal of Experimental Social Psychology, 48, pp. 1356-1360; (2014), http://www.contagious.com/blogs/news-and-views/14215281-d-ad-winnners, Hare, E., May 23, D&AD Winners (Sweetie by Lemz and Terre des Hommes won in the White Pencil category of D&AD award competition for social adverts) [web log post].

However, despite its widespread use, there are persistent misapplications of SEM in published empirical studies in the communication sciences. Of these types of misuse, the most troubling are those related to the exploitation of flexibilities in data collection and analysis. Given the number of decisions that must be made when analyzing and reporting structural equation models, decisions which often remain undisclosed, the potential for researchers to exploit flexibilities in SEM research is high. To assess the extent of this problem, as well as the more longstanding types of misuse (i.e., omission of information and disclosed “bad practice”) identified by prior studies, we undertake a methodical review of studies employing structural equation modeling within major journals in the field of communication between the years 2007 and 2011. Articles were coded on the characteristics of the sample, characteristics of the model tested, as well as for various potential problems that we defined a priori. The most serious issues are identified, and recommendations for future standards in SEM research are suggested. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Allison, P.D., Missing data techniques for structural equation modeling (2003) Journal of Abnormal Psychology, 112 (4), pp. 545-557;

But their reliance on reaction time data comes with issues for data preparation and analysis. Dealing with reaction time data can be complex – exacerbated by many steps and available alternatives. Greenwald et al. (2003) offer guidelines for handling IAT data. However, these guidelines are often cited with little information as to which steps and alternatives were chosen. This provides latitudes of freedom for researchers to choose the version that is most likely to give desired results, not necessarily the one that best reflects the data or matches other work. This manuscript reports what happens when steps in data cleaning and analysis are omitted or changed, finding variations in relationships between variables and the potential for significance tests to change depending on the version used. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Arpan, L., Rhodes, N., Roskos-Ewoldsen, D.R., Attitude accessibility: Theory, methods, and future directions (2007) Communication and social cognition: Theories and methods(pp. 351–376), , Rosks-Ewoldsen D.R., Monahan J., (eds), Mahwah, NJ: Erlbaum; DeHouwer, J., What are implicit measures and why are we using them?

Prior studies suggested that researchers’ focus on “p <.05” yields—intentional or unintentional—p-value misreporting, and excess p-values just below.05. To assess whether similar distortions occur in communication science, we extracted 5,834 test statistics from 693 recent communication science ISI papers, and assessed prevalence of p-values (1) misreported, and (2) just below.05. Results show 8.8% of p-values were misreported (74.5% too low). 1.3% of p-values were critically misreported, stating p <.05 while in fact p >.05 (88.3%) or vice versa (11.7%). Analyzing p-value frequencies just below.05 using a novel method did not unequivocally demonstrate “p-hacking”—excess p-values could be alternatively explained by (severe) publication bias. Results for 19,830 p-values from social psychology were strikingly similar. We conclude that publication bias, publication pressure, and verification bias distort the communication science knowledge base, and suggest solutions to this problem. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Asendorpf, J.B., Conner, M., De Fruyt, F., De Houwer, J., Denissen, J.J.A., Fiedler, K., Wicherts, J.M., Recommendations for increasing replicability in psychology (2013) European Journal of Personality, 27 (2), pp. 108-119; Bakker, M., Wicherts, J.M., The (mis)reporting of statistical results in psychology journals (2011) Behavior Research Methods, 43 (3), pp. 666-678; Bakker, M., Wicherts, J.M., Outlier removal and the relation with reporting errors and quality of psychological research (2014) Plos One, 9 (7), p. e103360; Brandt, M.J., IJzerman, H., Dijksterhuis, A., Farach, F.J., Geller, J., Giner-Sorolla, R., Van’t Veer, A., The replication recipe: What makes for a convincing replication?

As many attitudinal and behavioral measures in communication research consist of ordered-categorical items, this article provides an accessible introduction for applied researchers on categorical confirmatory factor analysis (cat-CFA) and measurement invariance (MI) testing for ordinal data. First, this paper presents conceptual discussions on the classical and the categorical FA models and conditions under which applications of the classical FA can lead to estimation biases. Second, model identification and specification issues with MI for ordinal data are discussed. Third, to demonstrate the techniques, cat-CFA and MI with ordinal data are applied to the revision of an existing self-report Likert-type measure, the Flirting Styles Inventory.

This study uses confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and discriminant analysis to evaluate Abdulla and colleagues’ (2004) measure of news credibility. Results indicate that although the factor structure of the measure is replicable, the measure exhibits significant concerns related to discriminant validity. A revised measurement model employing a second-order factor for the news credibility scale that eliminates the discriminant validity concerns is proposed, and the implications of second-order factors in measurement models are discussed.

We build on prior brain research that mapped mental processes, and describe a brain-as-predictor approach that encompasses studies that treat measures of brain activity in response to communication relevant tasks as: 1) mediators between communication relevant stimuli and outcomes, 2) moderators of the relationship between communication relevant stimuli and outcomes or 3) direct predictors of communication relevant outcomes. In this article, we give a detailed description of the brain-as-predictor approach and provide a guide and checklist for interested authors, reviewers and editors. We discuss how the approach can provide theoretical insights and advance practical applications in communication research. Given its potential for advancing theory and practice, we argue that the brain-as-predictor approach can complement other communication research methods and serve as a valuable addition to the communication science toolbox. © , Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,"National Science Foundation, NSF: 1360732",This work was supported in part by an NIH Director’s New Innovator Award (NIH-1 DP2 DA035156-01) to Emily B.

This is a systematic (and therefore quantifiable) relationship. Yet many open questions remain about the mechanisms that link form, function and communication relevant outcomes. Neuroimaging methods can provide insight into such processes that are not apparent from other methods. We argue that the combination of neural and linguistic measures will allow insight into both individual and population-level communication processes that would not be possible using either method in isolation. We present examples illustrating this methodological integration and notes regarding the most amenable linguistic tools. We summarize a framework in which language presented to and produced by participants undergoing neuroimaging is correlated with the resulting neural data and other proximal communication outcomes allowing the triangulation of individual experimental with population level outcomes, thereby linking between micro and macro levels of analysis. © , Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,DP2 DA035156-01,This work was supported in part by NIH-1 DP2 DA035156-01 (PI: Falk).,,"Aiden, E., Michel, J.-B., (2013) Uncharted: Big data as a lens on human culture, , New York, NY: Riverhead; Amodio, D.M., Bartholow, B.D., Ito, T.A., Tracking the dynamics of the social brain: ERP approaches for social cognitive and affective neuroscience (2013) Social Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience, 177, pp. 385-393; Asur, S., Huberman, B.A., Predicting the future with social media (2013) Applied Energy, 112, pp. 1536-1543; Awad, M., Warren, J.E., Scott, S.K., Turkheimer, F.E., Wise, R.J.S., A common system for the comprehension and production of narrative apeech (2007) The Journal of Neuroscience, 27 (43), pp. 11455-11464; Babcock, M.J., Ta, V.P., Ickes, W., Latent semantic similarity and language style matching in initial dyadic interactions (2014) Journal of Language and Social Psychology, 33 (1), pp. 78-88; (2010), http://www.lrec-conf.org/proceedings/lrec2010/pdf/769_Paper.pdf, Baccianella, S., Esuli, A., & Sebastiani, F., SentiWordNet 3.0: An Enhanced lexical resource for sentiment analysis and opinion mining.

A majority of these studies apply a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) approach. This trend raises two important questions that we address in this article. First, under what conditions can fMRI methodology increase knowledge and refine communication theory? Second, how can editors, reviewers, and readers of communication journals discriminate sound and relevant fMRI research from unsound or irrelevant fMRI research? To address these questions, we first discuss what can and cannot be accomplished with fMRI. Subsequently, we provide a pragmatic introduction to fMRI data collection and analysis for social-science-oriented communication scholars. We include practical guidelines and a checklist for reporting and evaluating fMRI studies. © , Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Aguirre, G.K., Zarahn, E., D’esposito, M., The variability of human, BOLD hemodynamic responses (1998) NeuroImage, 8 (4), pp. 360-369; Anderson, D.R., Bryant, J., Murray, J.P., Rich, M., Rivkin, M.J., Zillmann, D., Brain imaging–a new approach to studying media processes and effects (2006) Media Psychology, 8, pp. 1-6; Anderson, D.R., Fite, K.V., Petrovitch, N., Hirsch, J., Cortical activation while watching video montage: An fMRI study (2006) Media Psychology, 8 (1), pp. 7-24; Ariely, D., Berns, G.S., Neuromarketing: The hope and hype of neuroimaging in business (2010) Nature Reviews Neuroscience, 11 (4), pp. 284-292; Ashby, F.G., (2011) Statistical analysis of fMRI data, , Boston, MA: MIT Press; Aue, T., Lavelle, L.A., Cacioppo, J.T., Great expectations: What can fMRI research tell us about psychological phenomena?

In this essay, we provide an overview of the biological basis of EEG methodology and outline basic principles and practices of data collection. We conducted a study using EEG to test expectations from two competing cognitive theories of communication—computational theory and dynamic memory theory. Participants (N = 30) were assigned to one of two conditions—routine talk and direction-giving. EEG was used to measure the electrical activity in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), an area of the brain that is associated with message production. Results indicated that DLPFC activity was far more suggestive of dynamic memory theory. Specifically, electrical activity in the DLPFC was significantly lower during routine talk than during direction-giving. We discuss the implications of our findings and the limitations of EEG methods in communication research. © , Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Abelson, R.P., Script processing in attitude formation and decision making (1976) Cognitive and social behavior, pp. 33-45. , Carroll J.

To do this, participants watched film clips selected to vary on three media variables known to influence both attention and arousal: structural pacing (slow or fast), valence of emotion (pleasant, unpleasant), and level of arousing content (calm, arousing). Heart rate and skin conductance were measured time-locked to the presentation of each film clip. A variety of analysis techniques for each of these measures, some dynamic and some static, were compared with one another on their ability to perform in a manner suggested by general theoretical predictions. Strengths and weaknesses of each measure are identified based on these comparisons and recommendations about best practices are made. © , Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Allen, J.J.B., Chambers, A.S., Towers, D.N., The many metrics of cardiac chronotropy: A pragmatic primer and a brief comparison of metrics (2007) Biological Psychology, 74 (2), pp. 243-262; Berntson, G.G., Barbanera, G., (2014) Heart rate variability: Mechanisms, methods and interpretation, , September, Paper presented at the Society for Psychophysiological Research, Atlanta, GA:; Berntson, G.G., Bigger, J., Eckberg, D.L., Grossman, P., Kaufmann, P., Malik, G., van Der Molen, M.W., Heart rate variability: Origins, methods, and interpretive caveats (1997) Psychophysiology, 34 (6), pp. 623-648; Bolls, P.D., Lang, A., Potter, R.F., The effects of message valence and listener arousal on attention, memory, and facial muscular responses to radio advertisements (2001) Communication Research, 28 (5), pp. 627-651; Bradley, M.M., Lang, P.J., Affective reactions to acoustic stimuli (2000) Psychophysiology, 37 (2), pp. 204-215; Bradley, M.M., Lang, P.J., Measuring emotion: Behavior, feeling, and physiology (2000) Cognitive neuroscience of emotion, pp. 242-276. , Lane R.

Unlike other network analytic techniques that require online communication data to be summarized prior to analysis, relational event network analysis uses un-summarized time-stamped data to track the dynamic evolution of communication networks. To illustrate, we use relational event network analysis to analyze the evolution of a communication network within the virtual world Second Life. Results suggest that there are different patterns of communication among nonfriends and friends within the network. Nonfriends tend to communicate with those they have communicated with in the past, reciprocate communication, and close communication triads. Friends tend not to communicate with those they have communicated with in the past, instead preferring to reciprocate communication and close triads. We discuss implications for the study of online communication and identify directions for future research using relational event network analysis. © , Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,"National Science Foundation, NSF: IIS-084-1583

The method uses circular, transparent outlines (“bubbles”) that move over visual stimuli. To evaluate the method’s feasibility and validity, 50 men watched same- and opposite-sex erotica in self-directed and manipulated VA conditions while their psychophysiological responses were recorded. Participants were instructed to select a bubble by using a computer-mouse which kept selected content visible while darkening the rest of the screen. Only one bubble was available during the manipulated VA conditions. Findings revealed that participants could successfully perform the experimental task and that their spontaneous VA was consistent with predictions. Furthermore, the method successfully manipulated VA. The benefits of this application include the ability to measure and direct VA in multiple participants simultaneously, its ease of use, as well as its provision of relatively noise-free data. Advantages of using this method in social/behavioral science research are discussed. © , Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Barber, P.J., Legge, D., (1976) Perception and information, , London, United Kingdom: Methuen; Barlow, D.H., Causes of sexual dysfunction—the role of anxiety and cognitive interference (1986) Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology, 54 (2), pp. 140-148; Barth, E., Dorr, M., Böhme, M., Gegenfurtner, K., Martinetz, T., Guiding the mind’s eye: improving communication and vision by external control of the scanpath (2006) Electronic Imaging 2006, p. 60570D. , February, Bellingham, WA: International Society for Optics and Photonics; Böhme, M., Dorr, M., Krause, C., Martinetz, T., Barth, E., Eye movement predictions on natural videos (2006) Neurocomputing, 69 (16), pp. 1996-2004; Bolt, R.A., (1984) The human interface: Where people and computers meet, , Belmont, CA: Lifetime Learning Publications; Brasel, S.A., Gips, J., Breaking through fast-forwarding: Brand information and visual attention (2008) Journal of Marketing, 72 (6), pp. 31-48; Breitmeyer, B.G., (1984) Visual masking: An integrative approach, , New York, NY: Oxford University Press; Broadbent, D.E., (1958) Perception and communication, , New York, NY: Oxford University Press; Buquet, C., Charlier, J.R., Paris, V., Museum application of an eye tracker (1988) Medical Biomedical Engineering Computing, 26, pp. 277-281; Carrasco, M., Visual attention: The past 25 years (2011) Vision Research, 51 (13), pp. 1484-1525; Chamberlain, L., Eye tracking methodology; Theory and practice (2007) Qualitative Market Research: An International Journal, 10 (2), pp. 217-220; Cheal, M., Lyon, D.R., Central and peripheral precuing of forced-choice discrimination (1991) The Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology, 43 (4), pp. 859-880; Chen, M.C., Anderson, J.R., Sohn, M.H., What can a mouse cursor tell us more?

The first study generated an item pool by drawing from previous qualitative investigations and adapting an established relational maintenance scale. Participants were then invited to evaluate these items in order to establish face validity. During study two, participants were asked how often they used the behaviors represented in these items to maintain a specific friendship. Exploratory factor analysis was conducted to determine the underlying structure of these items; three latent factors emerged, social contact, response-seeking, and relational assurances. This factor structure was then assessed using confirmatory factor analysis during phase three. Study three participants were also asked to complete measures of friendship quality, Facebook intensity, and online social communication. The relationship of the three factors of Facebook relational maintenance to friendship quality, Facebook intensity, and online social communication suggests convergent and discriminant validity for the Facebook relational maintenance measure. © , Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"http://www.alexa.com/topsites, Alexa.com.

An important part of content analysis is establishing the reliability of the coding protocol, and reporting must be detailed enough to allow for replication of methodological procedures. This study employed a content analysis of published content analysis articles (N=581) in three communication journals over a 26-year period to examine changes in reliability sampling procedures and reporting of reliability coefficients across time. Findings indicate that general improvements have been made in the detail of reporting reliability, in the practice of reporting reliability coefficients that take chance into consideration, and in the reporting of reliability coefficients for more than one variable. However, explaining the reliability sampling process and use of a probability or census reliability sample did not change over time. In recent years, the preponderance of articles did not explain the reliability sampling method or report a reliability coefficient for all key study variables, and few utilized a census or probability sampling frame. Implications are discussed and recommendations made for reporting of reliability in content analysis.

One of the existing measures, the Cognitive Learning Measure (Frisby & Martin, 2010), has not yet been fully validated. This series of three studies examined the factorial and concurrent validity of the scale. Results revealed that a three-factor measurement model was a better fit to the data than the original unidimensional factor model. Concurrent validity was established with respect to student motives, affective learning, student interest, classroom participation, and out-of-class communication with their instructors. The measure is discussed as a viable option for both operationalization of cognitive learning and as a complement to other learning tests.

By automating the coding of frames in news, SML facilitates the incorporation of large-scale content analysis into framing research, even if financial resources are scarce. This furthers a more integrated investigation of framing processes conceptually as well as methodologically. We conduct several experiments in which we automate the coding of four generic frames that are operationalised as a set of indicator questions. In doing so, we compare two approaches to modelling the coherence between indicator questions and frames as an SML task. The results of our experiments show that SML is well suited to automate frame coding but that coding performance is dependent on the way SML is implemented.

Political knowledge test scores were higher in the online open-ended condition than in the classroom open-ended condition, with no evidence of venue differences for the multiple-choice or true/false format. This pattern is consistent with self-deceptive enhancement motivations.

For instance, research programs in mass communication, health, instructional, feminist/gender, interpersonal, and intercultural communication have all examined video games. Interactivity is the hallmark of video games and consequently is a common concept in the video game literature. While video game interactivity (VGI) is still an under-specified concept, previous research suggests that interactivity has the potential to moderate both positive and negative effects of video games, and therefore it is crucial for understanding general video game effects. We developed a theoretical model of video game interactivity and tested a multidimensional scale to assess video game interactivity across five studies using six independent samples. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses as well as item analyses revealed a reliable and valid metric consisting of six dimensions of video game interactivity.

Both heuristic and systematic processing are said to be aided by quick rules of thumb or mental shortcuts called heuristics. However, the operationalization of heuristics is quite problematic because their use in decision-making is not directly measured. Scholars claim the operation of specific heuristics in specific situations, based often on clever experimental evidence. We propose a methodological framework that calls for both manipulation and measurement of heuristics in order to offer more direct evidence of their operation. We first review different existing approaches in the literature for operationalizing heuristics. We then discuss our approach and describe the application of moderated mediation to analyze the resulting data. We conclude with a study idea and simulated data that illustrate how our proposed design and analysis framework could be applied in communication research.

Surprisingly, scholars have paid remarkably little attention to questions about the validity of various ways to measure campaign exposure. This paper begins to address this gap by outlining conceptual, empirical, and practical issues in developing valid measures of campaign exposure. First, I offer a brief definition of measurement validity and describe a variety of measurement options utilized in recent, large-scale health communication campaign evaluations. Next, I outline conceptual and empirical assumptions behind these various measurement strategies. I continue with a review of research that has applied validation criteria to specific measures of campaign exposure. I conclude by offering a series of guidelines for exposure measurement and validation practices based on the evidence to date, which I caveat by describing tensions and emergent issues that researchers will need to consider in future work.

Using developments in information processing research about effects of visual production features on attention and memory, this article advances the proposition that these features influence the perception of some objects as central or peripheral to the information presented in a specific visual scene. These structural features were combined here to develop and test a structural indicator of item centrality. The results show that such elements as size, proximity to other objects, brightness, motion, contrast, and position on screen account for a great deal of judgment-driven evaluations about objects' centrality. Moreover, the central and peripheral details identified using the structure-based measure replicated the same pattern of results produced in studies using a judgment-based definition. These findings suggest that structural features associated with an object are valid predictors of whether the object is perceived as central or whether it is perceived as peripheral. © 2014 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Barry, A.M., (1997) Visual intelligence: Perception, image, and manipulation in visual communication, , Albany, NY, Albany, NY,: State University of New York Press; Barry, A.M., (2005) Perception theory, , Mahwah, NJ, Mahwah, NJ,: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates; Bolls, P.D., Lang, A., Potter, R.F., The effects of message valence and listener arousal on attention, memory, and facial muscular responses to radio advertisements (2001) Communication Research, 28 (5), pp. 627-651; Bradley, S.D., Angelini, J.R., Lee, S., Psychophysiological and memory effects of negative political ads: Aversive, arousing, and well remembered (2007) Journal of Advertising, 36 (4), pp. 115-127; Brewer, W., What is autobiographical memory?

The meta-analysis reveals that only about half the studies reported significant group differences in the predicted direction. On average, manipulations had a small to medium effect. Certain manipulations were more likely to influence some types of involvement than others. Transportation was impacted by distraction, perspective taking instructions, and meta-narrative information. Manipulation of literary qualities that had a large effect on character identification had no effect on transportation. Stimulus display characteristics had the strongest effect on immersion, whereas manipulations of the media world qualities had a larger effect on presence. Demographic similarity enhanced perceived similarity but not identification. Effect sizes were larger for advertising than for entertainment. Print and videogame stimuli yielded larger effects than videos. Together, these findings identify manipulations that future studies can use to enhance their statistical power. © 2014 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Anker, A.E., Reinhart, A.M., Feeley, T.H., Meta-analysis of meta-analyses in communication research: Comparing fixed-effects and random-effects analysis models (2010) Communication Quarterly, 58, pp. 257-278; Appel, M., A story about a stupid person can make you act stupid (or smart): Behavioral assimilation (and contrast) as narrative impact (2011) Media Psychology, 14 (2), pp. 144-167; Appel, M., Malečkar, B., The influence of paratext on narrative persuasion: Fact, fiction, or fake?

In two population-based surveys, we evaluated three candidate measures of cancer patients' self-reported exposure to cancer-related direct-to-consumer advertising (CR-DTCA); these measures varied in content specificity and provision of ad exemplars. All three measures performed equally well in terms of internal consistency, convergent, nomological, and discriminant validity. Increased content specificity or ad exemplars did not improve performance of the exposure measures. Participants were able to extrapolate from ad exemplars to report their exposure to broad categories of CR-DTCA. The briefest of the three measures posed the lowest level of survey costs and was deployed successfully for mailed and internet-based survey administration. We discussed future directions for application of these findings in DTCA research for other illness and for media exposure research more generally. © 2014 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,"P20-CA095856-06, P50-CA095856-05","The authors wish to acknowledge the funding support of the National Cancer Institute’s Center of Excellence in Cancer Communication (CECCR) located at the Annenberg School for Communication, University of Pennsylvania (P50-CA095856-05 and P20-CA095856-06).",,"Abel, G.A., Burstein, H.J., Hevelone, N.D., Weeks, J.C., Cancer-related direct-to-consumer advertising: Awareness, perceptions, and reported impact among patients undergoing active cancer treatment (2009) Journal of Clinical Oncology, 27 (25), pp. 4182-4187; Abel, G.A., Lee, S.J., Weeks, J.C., Direct-to-consumer advertising in oncology: A content analysis of print media (2007) Journal of Clinical Oncology, 25 (10), pp. 1267-1271; Aikin, K.J., Swasy, J.L., Braman, A.C., (2004) Patient and physician attitudes and behaviors associated with DTC promotion of prescription drugs - summary of FDA survey research results, , http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/ScienceResearch/ResearchAreas/DrugMarketingAdvertisingandCommunicationsResearch/UCM152860.pdf, Washington, DC: U.S. Food and Drug Administration; (2006) Standard definitions: Final dispositions of case codes and outcome rates for surveys, , Deerfield, IL, Deerfield, IL,: Author American Association for Public Opinion Research (AAPOR); (2006) Hospital ad spending rising, , http://www.ama-assn.org/amednews/2006/02/27/bicb0227.htm, American Medical Association.

For example, information insufficiency is the difference between what people know and what they think they need to know about an issue, and it can motivate information seeking and processing. Common methods that compute this differential may bias model estimates as a function of the correlation between the differentiated variables and other variables in the model. This article describes the general form of Cohen and Cohen's (1983) analysis of partial variance for computing differentials and analyzes simulated data to contrast that method with two alternative methods.

This article critically examines the validity of the REALM as a measure of health literacy. Logical analysis of content coverage led to the conclusion that scores on the REALM should not be used to make inferences about a person's level of health literacy. Rather, the REALM should be used to make inferences about the ability of a person to read and pronounce health related terms. Evidence from an analysis of a sample of 1,037 respondents to the REALM with a cancer diagnosis supports the quality of the REALM as a measure of reading and pronunciation ability. Other uses of the REALM in health literacy research are discussed. © 2013 Copyright Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,01 CA140151,"This study was funded by NIH/NCI grant #R01 CA140151.

Scholars have called for the investigation of norms in qualitative research design to offer evaluators and qualitative scholars alike additional tools for judging and justifying specific methodological choices. In answer to this call, we analyzed the content of articles (N = 13,670) published in top-ranked journals in communication, public health, and interdisciplinary social science from 2005 to 2009. Findings revealed that the typical interview study had approximately 30 participants (median = 27). Focus groups had slightly more participants (median = 36) spread across an average of six groups. Only approximately 25% of all interview and focus group studies (N = 1,865) reported participants' mean age, and only about 19% reported participants' race/ethnicity. These findings offer a point of departure for discussions about standards in qualitative research. © 2013 Copyright Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Bochner, A., Criteria against ourselves (2000) Qualitative Inquiry, 6, pp. 266-272; Christie, C.A., Fleischer, D.N., Insight into evaluation practice: A content analysis of designs and methods used in evaluation studies published in North American evaluation-focused journals (2010) American Journal of Evaluation, 31, pp. 326-346; Cohen, D.J., Crabtree, B.F., Evaluative criteria for qualitative research in health care: Controversies and recommendations (2008) Annals of Family Medicine, 6, pp. 331-339; Corbin, J., Strauss, A., (2008) Basics of qualitative research, , 3rd, Los Angeles, CA, Los Angeles, CA,: Sage; Crenshaw, K., Mapping the margins: Intersectionality, identity politics, and violence against women of color (2003) Identities: Race, class, gender, and nationality, pp. 175-200. , In: Alcolff L., Mendieta E., editors Oxford, England, Oxford, England,: Wiley-Blackwell; Creswell, J.W., Miller, D.L., Determining validity in qualitative research (2000) Theory into Practice, 39, pp. 124-130; Davies, D., Dodd, J., Qualitative research and the question of rigor (2002) Qualitative Health Research, 12, pp. 279-289; Dixon-Woods, M., Shaw, R.L., Agarwal, S., Smith, J., The problem of appraising qualitative research (2004) Quality and Safety in Health Care, 13, pp. 223-225; Finset, A., Qualitative methods in communication and patient education research (2008) Patient Education & Counseling, 73, pp. 1-2; Flick, U., (2002) An introduction to qualitative research, , London, England, London, England,: Sage; Howe, K., Standards for qualitative (and quantitative) research (1990) Educational Researcher, 19, pp. 2-9; Kuper, A., Reeves, S., Levinson, W., Qualitative research: An introduction to reading and appraising qualitative research (2008) British Medical Journal, 337, pp. 404-407; Lindlof, T.R., Taylor, B.C., (2011) Qualitative communication research methods, , 3rd, Thousand Oaks, CA, Thousand Oaks, CA,: Sage; Marshall, C., Rossman, G.B., (2011) Designing qualitative research, , 5th, Thousand Oaks, CA, Thousand Oaks, CA,: Sage; Morse, J.M., Barret, M., Mayan, M., Olson, K., Spiers, J., Verification strategies for establishing reliability and validity in qualitative research (2002) International Journal of Qualitative Methods, 1, pp. 1-19; Seale, C., Quality in qualitative research (1999) Qualitative Inquiry, 5, pp. 465-478; Seers, K., Toye, F., What is quality in qualitative health research?

However, weaknesses associated with techniques commonly used to measure selective exposure have led to ambiguity in the interpretation of past results and inconsistency in findings across studies. This paper provides a review of previous research that has investigated selective exposure, particularly in a political context, by measuring participants' retrospective reports of exposure to prior information, by assessing behavioral intentions to consume information in the future, by observing selective exposure behavior directly, or by investigating aggregated behavioral information recorded over a period of time. These prior methods are critically evaluated and recommendations are made which should improve the measurement of selective exposure and consequently the validity and reliability of downstream findings stemming from research in this area. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Ajzen, I., Kuhi, J., Beckmann, J., From intentions to actions: A theory of planned behavior (1985) Action-control: From cognition to behavior, pp. 11-39. , Heidelberg, Germany, Heidelberg, Germany: Springer;

Networks of connected users on Twitter define the set of content to which each user is exposed. We developed a Selective Exposure Cluster (SEC) method to study these connected networks and their discussion patterns in Twitter. To illustrate the SEC method, we collected networks of connections among users who talked about a shared topic: the U.S. President's State of the Union speech in 2012. Cluster analysis was applied to identify subgroups of users who were densely interconnected. These users followed users from their own cluster more than they connected to users in other clusters. In each cluster, the primary distributors of information-the hub users-were identified, along with the hashtags, hyperlinks, and top-mentioned usernames in the content of the messages. Each of these indicators was labeled in terms of its political orientation. An analysis of the resulting patterns of selective exposure suggests that users participate in fragmented interactions and form divided groups in which people tune in to a narrow segment of the wider range of politically oriented information sources. We discuss the strengths and weaknesses of the proposed Selective Exposure Cluster method. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Adamic, L., Glance, N., (2005) The political blogosphere and the 2004 U.S. election: Divided they blog, , http://www.blogpulse.com/papers/2005/AdamicGlanceBlogWWW.pdf; Arendt, H., Truth and politics (1968) Between past and future: Eight exercises in political thought, , In: Arendt H., editors New York, NY, New York, NY: Viking Press; Babbie, E.R., (2012) The practice of social research, , Belmont, CA, Belmont, CA: Wadsworth; Calhoun, C., Populist politics, communication media and large scale societal integration (1988) Sociological Theory, 6, pp. 219-241. , Fall; Carrington, P.J., Scott, J., Wasserman, S., (2005) Models and methods in social network analysis, , New York, NY, New York, NY: Cambridge University Press; Chaffee, S.H., Saphir, M.S., Graf, J., Sandvig, C., Hahn, K.S., Attention to counter-attitudinal messages in a state election campaign (2001) Political Communication, 18 (3), pp. 247-272; Choi, S., Park, J., Park, H., (2011) Twitter, a medium for social mobilizing?: An exploratory study on the use of twitaddons.com in South Korea, , Paper presented at the International Network for Social Network Analysis.

We examine how four choices affect results in studies of selectivity in political contexts: including an entertainment option, including or excluding moderates, post-hoc adjustment of the subjects through a question about likelihood of selecting content in the real world, and assessing selectivity on the basis of issue attitudes or political ideology. Relying on a large experimental survey (N = 2,300), we compare the effects of these choices on two results: probability of selective exposure to like-minded political news and predictors of selective exposure (attitude strength, political interest, knowledge, and participation). Our findings show that probability estimates and, to a lesser extent, predictors of selective exposure are sensitive to methodological choices. These findings provide guidance about how methodological choices may affect researchers' assessments and conclusions. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Arceneaux, K., Johnson, M., Murphy, C., Polarized political communication, oppositional media hostility, and selective exposure (2012) Journal of Politics, 74 (1), pp. 174-186; Baum, M.A., Kernell, S., Has cable ended the golden age of presidential television?

However, much of the research on this topic has relied on potentially inaccurate assumptions. In our paper we apply an open-source, publicly available, high-dimensional measurement of meaning through word co-occurrence context (Shaoul & Westbury, 2010), which has historically been applied to questions of semantic relationships between words. This method allows scholars to avoid pitfalls from previous assumptions and determine previously unknown ideological positions of previously unknown sources. We demonstrate the validity and range of this method and provide a series of best practices for scholars who wish to employ this tool in their own research. Our method will ultimately expand the variety of research questions available as well as improving inferences, opening up new lines of research for scholars studying media consumption and political behavior. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Abrajano, M., Are Blacks and Latinos responsible for the passage of Proposition 8?

Murray Hall, Stillwater, OK 74078, United States; Seger, J., Cameron University, United States","Two studies examined the validity of adults' retrospective memory for remote past television viewing. In both studies, participants between 18 and 22 years of age reported their past viewing levels for primetime TV series from 10 years, five years, and one year prior to testing. Validity of those remote memories was assessed via examination of ecological viewing patterns, as well as testing memory for program content. In both studies, people reported expected naturalistic, selective, and logically consistent TV viewing patterns. In Study 1, participants' cued recall of basic content from a random selection of programs was a clear positive function of reported past viewing levels for those programs. In Study 2, memory for program content was assessed in recognition format, and again was a positive function of reported past viewing levels. Further evidence of validity of past viewing reports was found in predicted developmental trends, namely, viewing levels increased across years, in later time slots, and for more adult program genres. Overall, findings indicated valid reporting of early TV viewing, with implications for retrospective designs for investigating long term relationships between early TV exposure and later adult characteristics. © 2013 Copyright Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Nielsen, A.C., (2011) State of the media: Cross-platform report, , www.nielsen.com, Quarter 1, 2011; Anderson, C.A., Berkowitz, L., Donnerstein, E., Huesmann, L.R., Johnson, J.D., Linz, D., Wartella, E., The influence of media violence on youth (2003) Psychological Science in the Public Interest, 4, pp. 81-110; Anderson, C.A., Bushman, B.J., Human aggression (2002) Annual Review of Psychology, 53, pp. 27-51; Anderson, C.A., Carnegy, N.L., Causal effects of violent sports video games on aggression: Is it competitiveness or violent content?

However, this work has yet to be applied to distributions of participation in small groups. This article provides an application of social network analysis to small group interaction and illustrates the approach through the analysis of 54 team meetings in two medium-sized German companies from the electrical and automotive supply industries (N = 332). Within a group interaction process, individual actions affect subsequent behavior, and their interactions shape a network when group members respond to previous actions. Their responses can be understood as network ties. We describe how to calculate centralization for all forms of small group interactions, and contribute to network research by providing insights into the interaction structure of team meetings. Multilevel analyses show that a group-level measure of centralization has a significant negative effect on team performance, whereas individual participation has no such effect. Implications for future research on interaction data via social network analysis are discussed. © 2013 Copyright Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,"Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG

Frames and other semantic structures are co-constructed in the public debate based on the contributions of many discourse participants. Over time, they incorporate new information and interpretations. As a result, time-dependent changes occur both on the level of manifest contributions and on the level of latent structures organizing discourse into meaningful frames. This article introduces a technique capable of analyzing the changing patterns of meaning in a genuinely dynamic fashion. It applies Evolutionary Factor Analysis (EFA), a recently developed technique for treating high-dimensional data with time-changing latent structure. Using EFA, we uncover evolving patterns on different levels of abstraction within our data, which represent discourse as a detailed semantic network. We investigate specific dynamics expected within dynamic discourse (e.g., emergence, evolution, consolidation, crisis) and analyze the time-changing structure and content of meaning. The methodological innovation presented in this paper allows a detailed analysis of micro-level changes organized by latent higher-level structures: It can be transferred to a variety of social phenomena organized by structures that evolve over time (e.g., public opinion, social interaction). Rendering their dynamic behavior accessible to statistical analysis, it offers new theoretical insights into their mechanics and underlying structure. © 2013 Copyright Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Aarts, K., van der Kolk, H., (2005) Nederlanders in Europa: Het referendum over de Europese Grondwet, , Amsterdam, The Netherlands, Amsterdam,: Uitgeverij Bert Bakker; van Atteveldt, W., (Doctoral dissertation) (2008) Semantic network analysis: Techniques for extracting, representing, and querying media content, , the Netherlands, the Netherlands,: Free University Amsterdam; van Atteveldt, W., Ruigrok, N., Kleinnijenhuis, J., (2006) Associative framing: A unified method for measuring media frames and the media agenda, , Dresden, Germany, Dresden,: Paper presented at the ICA 56th Annual Conference; Baden, C., (2010) Communication, contextualization, & cognition: Patterns & processes of frames' influence on people's interpretations of the EU constitution, , Delft, The Netherlands, Delft,: Eburon; Baden, C., de Vreese, C.H., Making sense: A reconstruction of peoples understandings of the European constitutional referendum in the Netherlands (2008) Communications, 33, pp. 117-146; Baden, C., Koch, T., (2011) The dynamics of frames in media discourse: Stability & change in the Dutch press coverage of the EU constitution, , Boston, MA, Boston, MA,: Paper presented at the 61st ICA Annual Conference; Baden, C., Schultz, F., (2012) Re-shaping the meaning of crises: The role of strategic framing and institutional justifications for affecting mass media crisis coverage, , Durban, South Africa, Durban,: Paper presented at the IAMCR Annual Conference; Baden, C., Motta, G., Dimitrakopoulou, D., (2012) The dynamic reconstruction of meaning in the debt crisis: An evolutionary factor analysis of strategic frames and journalistic accounts in Germany and Greece, , Istanbul, Turkey, Istanbul,: Paper presented at the ECREA 4th European Communication Conference; Baumgartner, F.R., De Boef, S., Boydstun, A.E., (2008) The decline of the death penalty and the discovery of innocence, , Cambridge, MA, Cambridge, MA,: Cambridge University Press; Beauchamp, N., (2011) Using text to scale legislatures with uninformative voting, , www.nickbeauchamp.com/work/Beauchamp_scaling_current.pdf, Unpublished working paper: Retrieved from; Benford, R.D., Snow, D.A., Framing processes and social movements: An overview and assessment (2000) Annual Review of Sociology, 26, pp. 611-639; Berinsky, A.J., Kinder, D.R., Making sense of issues through media frames: Understanding the Kosovo crisis (2006) The Journal of Politics, 68 (3), pp. 640-656; Buntine, W.L., Jakulin, A., (2005) Discrete component analysis, , Bohinj, Slovenia, Bohinj, Slovenia,: Paper presented at the Subspace, Latent Structure and Feature Selection, Statistical and Optimization, Perspectives Workshop; Chang, J., Blei, D.M., (2009) Relational topic models for document networks, , Clearwater Beach, FL, Clearwater Beach, FL,: Paper presented at the International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Statistics (AISTATS); Chong, D., Druckman, J.N., A theory of framing and opinion formation in competitive elite environments (2007) Journal of Communication, 57, pp. 99-118; Converse, P.E., The nature of belief systems in mass publics (1964) Ideology and discontent, pp. 206-261. , In: Apter D.

When communication research employs real-world audiovisual stimuli, the measurement sensitivity of EDA-based data can become challenging. Measures that are commonly employed to correlate EDA with continuous stimuli (the tonic skin conductance level and the frequency of skin conductance responses) are replicable for stimuli of one minute or longer. This article discusses positive changes in EDA (EPC) as a measure that integrates the frequency of skin conductance responses with their amplitude while reducing processing complexity and error. The use of EDA data from 115 subjects demonstrates that EPC is a more accurate measure of stimulus-induced arousal than the response frequency, the conductance baseline, and average skin conductance. Assets and drawbacks are discussed in the context of theoretical and practical issues. © 2012 Copyright Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Andreassi, J.L., Electrodermal activity (EDA) and behavior (2000) Psychophysiology: Human behavior and physiological response, pp. 191-217. , In: Andreassi J.

This study provides evidence consistent with a concern that between-participant differences in exposure to communication theories can be a threat to the internal validity of conclusions reached. Using cultivation theory as a context for studying this threat, this study examines the influence of stage in university education and discipline of study on the ability to detect the cultivation hypothesis and participants' responses to questions regularly used in studies of cultivation. We found that university students at different stages of their studies and studying different disciplines differed in their responses to questions pertinent to cultivation and also in their ability to identify the cultivation hypothesis. We discuss the consequences of the use of convenience sampling and strategies that may help reduce these effects. © 2012 Copyright Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Adair, J.G., Schachter, B.S., To cooperate or to look good?

We discuss how these categories can be employed by researchers when conceptualizing and articulating the theoretical contributions planned in their research and by reviewers, editors, and researchers in critically assessing such contributions in the work of others. © 2012 Copyright Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Anderson, P., Buller, D., Voeks, J., Walkosz, B., Scott, M., Cutter, G., Dignan, M., Testing the long-term effects of the Go Sun Smart worksite health communication campaign: A group-randomized experimental study (2008) Journal of Communication, 58, pp. 447-471; Appel, M., Fictional narratives cultivate just world beliefs (2008) Journal of Communication, 58, pp. 62-83; Baron, R.M., Kenny, D.A., The moderator-mediator variable distinction in social psychological research: Conceptual, strategic, and statistical considerations (1986) Journal of Personal Social Psychology, 51 (6), pp. 1173-1182; Berger, C.R., Roloff, M.E., Roskos-Ewoldsen, D.R., What is communication science?

This study presents an experiment (N = 684, random selection) that tests three different approaches for snowballing discussants in a web-based survey by varying both the type of invitation sent to the discussants and the level of privacy protection. The major challenge is to obtain contact information on discussants from main respondents while discussants are willing to participate in surveys. Results show no major differences between the different methods of snowballing discussants. Implications and suggestions for future survey research are discussed. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Beck, P.A., Dalton, R.J., Greene, S., Huckfeldt, R., The social calculus of voting: Interpersonal, media, and organizational influences on presidential choices (2002) American Political Science Review, 96 (1), pp. 57-73; Billiet, J., Philippens, M., Fitzgerald, R., Stoop, I., Estimation of nonresponse bias in the European social survey: Using information from reluctant respondents (2007) Journal of Official Statistics, 23 (2), pp. 135-162; Coromina, L., Coenders, G., Reliability and validity of egocentered network data collected via web: A meta-analysis of multilevel multitrait multimethod studies (2006) Social Networks, 28 (3), pp. 209-231; de Heer, W., International response trends: Results of an international survey (1999) Journal of Official Statistics, 15 (2), pp. 129-142; Delhey, J., Newton, K., Predicting cross-national levels of social trust: Global pattern or Nordic exceptionalism?

However, when users can interact with messages, new sources of variation emerge that make generalization difficult. This article introduces methods that communication researchers can use to increase the external validity of studies investigating the effects of interactivity versus noninteractivity. For this area of research, the article recommends the use of forced-interaction studies with random assignment to maximize internal validity, and free-interaction studies with self-selection bias modeling to maximize external validity. The article concludes with examples of self-selection bias modeling, using data from real studies, and a discussion of their implications for communication researchers. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Amichai-Hamburger, Y., Personality, individual differences and internet use (2007) The Oxford handbook of Internet psychology, pp. 187-204. , In: Joinson A.

This article provides the rationale for and theoretical background of equivalence testing and offers examples of equivalence tests for the independent and dependent groups t-test and tests of association using Pearson's coefficient or correlation. From a review of meta-analyses, we provide tables of commonly observed effect-sizes across subdisciplines and topic areas in communication and offer these as a guideline for choosing minimum substantial effects (Δ) in equivalence testing when no other information source is available. To facilitate the adoption of equivalence tests in future research, we provide easy-to-use custom dialogs for SPSS which greatly simplify their computation and application. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Allen, M., Preiss, R.W., Gayle, B.M., Burrell, N., (2002) Interpersonal communication research: Advances through meta-analysis, , Mahwah, NJ: Erlbaum; Allen, M., Preiss, R.W., (1998) Persuasion: Advances through meta-analysis, , Creskill, NJ: Hampton Press; Anderson, S., Hauck, W.W., A new procedure for testing equivalence in comparative bioavailability and other clinical trials (1983) Communications in Statistics-Theory and Methods, 12, pp. 2663-2692; Anderson, C.A., Bushman, B.J., The effects of media violence on society (2002) Science, 295, pp. 2377-2378; Anderson, C.A., Lindsay, J.J., Bushman, B.J., Research in the psychological laboratory: Truth or triviality?

The Monte Carlo confidence interval method has several distinct advantages over rival methods. Its performance is comparable to other widely accepted methods of interval construction, it can be used when only summary data are available, it can be used in situations where rival methods (e.g., bootstrapping and distribution of the product methods) are difficult or impossible, and it is not as computer-intensive as some other methods. In this study we discuss Monte Carlo confidence intervals for indirect effects, report the results of a simulation study comparing their performance to that of competing methods, demonstrate the method in applied examples, and discuss several software options for implementation in applied settings. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Aroian, L.A., The probability function of the product of two normally distributed variables (1947) Annals of Mathematical Statistics, 18, pp. 265-271; Baron, R.M., Kenny, D.A., The moderator-mediator variable distinction in social psychological research: Conceptual, strategic, and statistical considerations (1986) Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 51, pp. 1173-1182; Bauer, D.J., Preacher, K.J., Gil, K.M., Conceptualizing and testing random indirect effects and moderated mediation in multilevel models: New procedures and recommendations (2006) Psychological Methods, 11, pp. 142-163; Biesanz, J.C., Falk, C., Savalei, V., Assessing mediational models: Testing and interval estimation for indirect effects (2010) Multivariate Behavioral Research, 45, pp. 661-701; Bollen, K.A., Stine, R., Direct and indirect effects: Classical and bootstrap estimates of variability (1990) Sociological Methodology, 20, pp. 115-140; Chernick, M.R., (2008) Bootstrap methods: A guide for practitioners and researchers, , 2nd, Hoboken, NJ: Wiley; Cheung, M.W.L., Comparison of approaches to constructing confidence intervals for mediating effects using structural equation models (2007) Structural Equation Modeling, 14, pp. 227-246; Cole, D.A., Maxwell, S.E., Testing mediational models with longitudinal data: Questions and tips in the use of structural equation modeling (2003) Journal of Abnormal Psychology, 112, pp. 558-577; Craig, C.C., On the frequency function of xy (1936) Annals of Mathematical Statistics, 7, pp. 1-15; Davison, A.C., Hinkley, D.V., (1997) Bootstrap methods and their application, , Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press; DiCiccio, T.J., Efron, B., Bootstrap confidence intervals (with discussion) (1996) Statistical Science, 11, pp. 189-228; DiCiccio, T.J., Romano, J.P., The automatic percentile method: Accurate confidence limits in parametric models (1989) Canadian Journal of Statistics, 17, pp. 155-169; Efron, B., Bootstrap methods (1979) Annals of Statistics, 7, pp. 1-26; Efron, B., (1980) The jackknife, the bootstrap, and other resampling plans, , Stanford, CA: Department of Statistics, Stanford University, (Technical Report No.63); Efron, B., Nonparametric estimates of standard error: the jackknife, the bootstrap, and other resampling methods (1981) Biometrika, 68, pp. 589-599; Efron, B., The jackknife, the bootstrap and other resampling plans (1982) Society of Industrial and Applied Mathematics CBMS-NSF Monographs, 38. , Philadelphia, PA; Efron, B., Better bootstrap confidence intervals (with discussion) (1987) Journal of the American Statistical Association, 82, pp. 171-185; Efron, B., Bootstrap confidence intervals: Good or bad?

The first study inductively develops an initial item pool through open-ended questionnaire data. A second study subjects the measures to exploratory factor analysis to ascertain an underlying factor structure. The third study deductively tests the measures through confirmatory factor analysis and examines associations among teacher communication behaviors, student emotional and cognitive interest, and engagement. A fourth study offers discriminant validity evidence, suggesting that the new measures are distinct from scales that assess similar yet divergent constructs. Guided by prior theory (Mottet, Frymier, & Beebe, 2006) and research (Harp & Mayer, 1997), the instruments developed here possess heuristic potential for instructional communication research. Implications and areas for future research are discussed. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Andersen, J.F., Teacher immediacy as a predictor of teaching effectiveness (1979) Communication yearbook, 3, pp. 543-559. , In: Nimmo D., editors New Brunswick, NJ: Transaction Books; Andersen, P.A., Andersen, J.F., Nonverbal immediacy in instruction (1982) Communication in the classroom, pp. 98-120. , In: Barker L., editors Engelwood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice Hall; Baldwin, J.M., (1906) Thought and things: A study of the development and meaning of thought, I. , New York, NY: Macmillan; Bandura, A., (1977) Social learning theory, , Upper Saddle River, NJ: Prentice Hall; Baxter, L.A., Babbie, E., (2004) The basics of communication research, , Belmont, CA: Wadsworth; Berlyne, D.E., (1960) Conflict, arousal and curiosity, , New York, NY: Grove Press; Bloom, B.S., (1956) Taxonomy of educational objectives: Handbook 2: The cognitive domain, , New York, NY: Longmans, Green; Bomia, L., Beluzo, L., Demeester, D., Elander, K., Johnson, M., Sheldon, B., (1997) The impact of teaching strategies on intrinsic motivation, , ERIC Document Reproduction Service No. ED 418925; Bourhis, J., Allen, M., Meta-analysis of the relationship between communication apprehension and cognitive performance (1992) Communication Education, 41, pp. 68-76; Brophy, J., Conceptualizing student motivation (1983) Educational Psychologist, 18, pp. 200-215; Bruner, J.S., (1960) The process of education, , Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press; Bush, A.J., Kennedy, J.J., Cruickshank, D.R., An empirical investigation of teacher clarity (1977) Journal of Teacher Education, 28, pp. 53-58; Campbell, D.T., Fiske, D.W., Convergent and discriminant validation by the multitrait-multimethod matrix (1959) Psychological Bulletin, 56, pp. 81-105; Chesebro, J.L., Effects of teacher clarity and nonverbal immediacy on student learning, receiver apprehension, and affect (2003) Communication Education, 52, pp. 135-147; Christophel, D., The relationship among teacher immediacy behaviors, student motivation, and learning (1990) Communication Education, 39, pp. 323-340; Comadena, M.E., Hunt, S.K., Simonds, C.J., The effects of teacher clarity, nonverbal immediacy, and caring on student motivation, affective and cognitive learning (2007) Communication Research Reports, 24, pp. 241-248; Comstock, J., Rowell, E., Bowers, J.W., Food for thought: Teacher nonverbal immediacy, student learning, and curvilinearity (1995) Communication Education, 44, pp. 251-266; Connell, J.P., Wellborn, J.G., Competence, autonomy, and relatedness: A motivational analysis of self-esteem processes (1991) Self processes in development: Minnesota symposium on child psychology, pp. 43-77. , In: Gunnar M.

However, recent studies have suggested such measures of mobile phone communication use contain a significant amount of measurement error. This study compares the frequency of mobile phone use measured by self-report questions with error-free log data automatically collected through an Android smartphone application. Using data from 310 Android phone users in Japan, we investigate the extent to which nonrandom measurement error exists in self-report responses to questions about mobile phone use and predictors of this error. Our analysis shows that users generally overreport their frequency of mobile communication and that overestimation is better predicted by proxy measures of social activity than demographic variables. We further show an example of how overreporting can result in an overestimation of the effects of mediated communication on civic engagement. Finally, the value of behavioral log data in mediated communication research is discussed. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Asher, H.B., Some consequences of measurement errors in survey data (1974) American Journal of Political Science, 18, pp. 469-485; Auvinen, A., Hietanen, M., Luukkonen, R., Koskela, R.S., Brain tumors and salivary gland cancers among cellular telephone users (2002) Epidemiology, 13, pp. 356-359; Bartels, L.M., Messages incoming: The political impact of media exposure (1993) American Political Science Review, 87, pp. 267-285; Bedeian, A.G., Day, D.V., Kelloway, E.K., Correcting for measurement error attenuation in structural equation models: Some important reminders (1997) Educational and Psychological Measurement, 57, pp. 785-799; Belli, R.F., Schwarz, N., Singer, E., Talarico, J., Decomposition can harm accuracy of behavioural frequency reports (2000) Applied Cognitive Psychology, 14, pp. 295-308; Berg, G., Schüz, J., Samkange-Zeeb, F., Blettner, M., Assessment of radiofrequency exposure from cellular telephone daily use in an epidemiological study: German validation study of the international case-control study of cancers of the brain-INTERPHONE-Study (2005) Journal of Exposure Analysis and Environmental Epidemiology, 15, pp. 217-224; Blalock, H.M., Estimating measurement error using multiple indicators and several points in time (1970) American Sociological Review, 35, pp. 101-111; Blair, E., Burton, S., Cognitive processes used by survey respondents to answer behavioral frequency questions (1987) Journal of Consumer Research, 14, pp. 280-288; Boase, J., Ling, R., Measuring mobile phone use: self-report versus log data Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication, , in press; Campbell, S.W., Kwak, N., Mobile communication and civic life: Linking patterns of use to civic and political engagement (2010) Journal of Communication, 60, pp. 536-555; Cohen, A.A., Lemish, D., Real time and recall measures of mobile phone use: Some methodological concerns and empirical applications (2003) New Media & Society, 5, pp. 167-183; Crocker, L., Algina, J., (1986) Introduction to classical and modern test theory, , Fort Worth, TX: Holt, Rinehart and Winston; del Boca, F.K., Darkes, J., The validity of self-reports of alcohol consumption: State of the science and challenges for research (2003) Addiction, 98, pp. 1-12; Eagle, N., Pentland, A., Lazer, D., Inferring friendship network structure by using mobile phone data (2009) Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 106, pp. 15274-15278; Fan, X., Two approaches for correcting correlation attenuation caused by measurement error: Implications for research practice (2003) Educational and Psychological Measurement, 63, pp. 915-930; Funch, D.P., Rothman, K.J., Loughlin, J.E., Dreyer, N.A., Utility of telephone company records for epidemiologic studies of cellular telephones (1996) Epidemiology, 7, pp. 299-302; Johansen, C., Boice Jr., J.D., McLaughlin, J.K., Olsen, J.H., Cellular telephones and cancer-a nationwide cohort study in Denmark (2001) Journal of the National Cancer Institute, 93, pp. 203-207; Menon, G., The effects of accessibility of information in memory on judgments of behavioural frequencies (1993) Journal of Consumer Research, 20, pp. 431-440; Menon, G., Are the parts better than the whole?

This study proposes four potential measures of media exposure to contradictory health information, using nutrition as an example (measures I-IV). The measures varied on two dimensions: (1) content specificity, or whether specific nutrition topics and health consequences were mentioned in the question scripting, and (2) obtrusiveness, or whether ""contradictory or conflicting information"" was mentioned. Using data from the Annenberg National Health Communication Survey, we evaluated the performance of each measure against a set of validity criteria including nomological, convergent, and face validity. Overall, measure IV, which was moderately content-specific and obtrusive, performed consistently well and may prove most useful to researchers studying media effects of contradictory health information. Future directions and applications are discussed. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,"National Cancer Institute, NCI: P20-CA095856-08","This study was supported by a grant from the National Cancer Institute (NCI) (P20-CA095856-08).

The DCS was developed with several goals in mind: a well-grounded theoretical background, economical coding, the inclusion of nonverbal behavior into the coding, the ability to code different sized groups engaged in a variety of task types, and high ease of use. Important aspects of communication behavior are covered: the directly observable aspects of who speaks to whom, the functions of a statement for the interaction process, and the interpersonal meaning of an act on the two basic behavioral dimensions of affiliation and dominance. Furthermore, coding software was developed that greatly enhances the efficiency of coding as well as the creation of data files. The reliabilities are strong if video is used. The reliabilities for real-time coding are considerably lower but still satisfactory if special measures are taken.

It can bias meta-analytic estimates upwards because the meta-analyses are missing studies that provide small estimates of the effect size under study. This paper describes the trim and fill technique of estimating the impact of publication bias on meta-analyses (Duval & Tweedie, 2000a, 2000b) and provides a working example. A sample of 68 meta-analyses of communication research were tested for publication bias using the trim and fill technique. The results suggest that most communication meta-analyses are not substantially affected by publication bias. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Allen, M., D'Alessio, D., Emmers, T.M., Gebhardt, L., The role of educational briefings in mitigating effects of experimental exposure to violent sexually explicit material: A meta-analysis (1996) The Journal of Sex Research, 33, pp. 135-141; Allen, M., Emmers-Sommer, T.M., Crowell, T.L., Couples negotiating safer sex behaviors: A meta-analysis of the impact of conversation and gender (2002) Interpersonal communication research: Advances through meta-analysis, pp. 263-279. , In: Allen M., Preiss R.

This article compares the results of two kinds of human coding framing analysis. The first is a method developed by Matthes and Kohring (2008) involving human coding of elements based on Entman's (1993) definition of frames, and the second coding is based on an extracted set of frames. Cluster analysis of news articles on population published from 1987-2007 in the Philippines yielded an optimum number of three communities or frames that agree with the holistic predetermined frames. Results indicate support for the validity of both procedures. Methodological implications are further discussed. © 2011 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,Research reported in this article is supported by a grant from the University of the Philippines Office of the Vice-Chancellor for Research and Development (UP OVCRD) to Clarissa C.

Survey measures often ask respondents about the number of days in a week or the hours in a day that they use a medium. These two strategies (and their composite-hours per week) have yet to be directly compared to one another, so their relative usefulness for researchers is unknown. Analyses of data from the 2008 American National Election Studies Time Series Study suggest few benefits from measuring news exposure using both approaches. The measures of exposure as days per week, minutes per day, and minutes per week (the product of the first two) operate similarly as predictors of political knowledge, perceived issue distances between presidential candidates, days per week talking about politics, levels of community involvement, and voter turnout. © 2011 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Abramowitz, A.I., Stone, W.J., The Bush effect: Polarization, turnout, and activism in the 2004 presidential election (2006) Presidential Studies Quarterly, 36 (2), pp. 141-154; Althaus, S.L., (2003) Collective preferences in democratic politics: Opinion surveys and the will of the people, , New York, NY: Cambridge University Press; Althaus, S.L., Free falls, high dives, and the future of democratic accountability (2007) The politics of news/the news of politics, pp. 161-189. , In: Graber D., McQuail D., Norris P., editors 2nd, Washington, DC: Congressional Quarterly Press; (2009) 2008 time series study, , http://www.electionstudies.org/studypages/2008prepost/2008prepost.htm, American National Election Studies; Linking measures of media exposure to sexual cognitions and behaviors: A review (2008) Communication Methods and Measures, 2, pp. 23-42. , Annenberg Media Exposure Research Group; Bartels, L.M., Messages received: The political impact of media exposure (1993) American Political Science Review, 87, pp. 267-285; Chaffee, S.H., Schleuder, J., Measurement and effects of attention to media news (1986) Human Communication Research, 13, pp. 76-107; Coromina, L., Saris, W.E., Quality of media use measurement (2009) International Journal of Public Opinion Research, 21, pp. 424-450; Delli Carpini, M.X., Keeter, S., (1996) What Americans know about politics and why it matters, , New Haven, CT: Yale University Press; Donohew, L., Lorch, E.P., Palmgreen, P., Applications of a theoretic model of information exposure to health interventions (1998) Human Communication Research, 24, pp. 454-468; Drew, D., Weaver, D., Media attention, media exposure, and media effects (1990) Journalism Quarterly, 67, pp. 740-748; Eveland Jr., W.P., Hutchens, M.J., Shen, F., Exposure, attention, or ""use"" of the news?

First, it examines whether Wordscores, developed by Laver, Benoit, and Garry (2003), can be adapted to reliably predict the valence of open-ended responses in a survey about bioethical issues in genetics research, and then tests a complementary and novel technique for coding the number of valenced thoughts in open-ended responses, termed Affective Intonation. Results show that Wordscores successfully predicts the valence of brief and grammatically imperfect open-ended responses, and Affective Intonation achieves comparable performance to human coders when estimating number of valenced thoughts. Both Wordscores and Affective Intonation have promise as reliable, effective, and efficient methods when researchers content-analyze large amounts of textual data systematically. © 2011 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Bantum, E.O.C., Owen, J.E., Evaluating the validity of computerized content analysis programs for identification of emotional expression in cancer narratives (2009) Psychological Assessment, 21 (1), pp. 79-88; Benoit, K., Laver, M., Mikhaylov, S., Treating words as data with error: Uncertainty in text statements of policy positions (2009) American Journal of Political Science, 53, pp. 495-513; Brock, T.C., Communication discrepancy and intent to persuade as determinants of counterargument production (1967) Journal of Experimental Social Psychology, 3 (3), pp. 296-309; Cappella, J.N., Price, V., Nir, L., Argument repertoire as a reliable and valid measure of opinion quality: Electronic dialogue during campaign 2000 (2002) Political Communication, 19 (1), pp. 73-93; Damerau, F.J., (1971) Markov models and linguistic theory, an experimental study of a model for English, , The Hague, The Netherlands: Mouton; Duda, R.O., Hart, P.E., Stork, D.G., (2000) Pattern classification, , 2nd, New York, NY: John Wiley & Sons, Inc; Fan, D.P., Holway, W.B., Media coverage of cocaine and its impact on usage patterns (1994) International Journal of Public Opinion Research, 6 (2), pp. 139-162; Feinerer, I., Hornik, K., Meyer, D., Text mining infrastructure in R (2008) Journal of Statistical Software, 25 (5), pp. 1-54; Hopkins, D.J., King, G., A method of automated nonparametric content analysis for social science (2009) American Journal of Political Science, 54 (1), pp. 229-247; Klemmensen, R., Hobolt, S.B., Hansen, M.E., Estimating policy positions using political texts: An evaluation of the Wordscores approach (2007) Electoral Studies, 26 (4), pp. 746-755; Krippendorff, K., (2004) Content analysis: An introduction to its methodology, , Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage Publications; Laver, M., Benoit, K., Garry, J., Extracting policy positions from political texts using words as data (2003) The American Political Science Review, 97 (2), pp. 311-331; Laver, M., Garry, J., Estimating policy positions from political texts (2000) American Journal of Political Science, 44 (3), pp. 619-634; Lowe, W., Understanding wordscores (2008) Political Analysis, 16 (4), pp. 356-371; Martin, L.W., Vanberg, G., A robust transformation procedure for interpreting political text (2008) Political Analysis, 16 (1), pp. 93-100; Monroe, B.L., Schrodt, P.A., Introduction to the special issue: The statistical analysis of political text (2008) Political Analysis, 16 (4), pp. 351-355; Pang, B., Lee, L., Opinion mining and sentiment analysis (2008) Foundations and Trends in Information Retrieval, 2 (1), pp. 1-135; Pennebaker, J.W., Francis, M.E., Booth, R., (2001) Linguistic inquiry and word count: LIWC 2001, , Mahwah, NJ: Erlbaum; Petty, R.E., Brinol, P., Tormala, Z.L., Thought confidence as a determinant of persuasion: The self-validation hypothesis (2002) Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 82 (5), pp. 722-741; Petty, R.E., Cacioppo, J.T., (1986) Communication and persuasion: Central and peripheral routes to attitude change, , New York, NY: Springer-Verlag; Petty, R.E., Wegener, D.T., Attitude change: Multiple roles for persuasion variables (1998) Handbook of social psychology, 2. , In: Gilbert D.

Emotional involvement with arguing and emotional involvement with verbal aggressing were added to clarify the originating theory and to improve model fit. The argumentativeness scale was heterogeneous, consisting of distinct ability and motivation to argue factors. Ability to argue had a direct negative effect and an indirect positive effect on verbal aggressiveness, with this positive effect mediated by motivation to argue. The positive effect of motivation to argue on verbal aggressiveness was moderated by college education, suggesting that students acquire a debate schema during their first semesters of college that enables them to better control their arguments, preventing escalation into verbal aggression. The methodological and theoretical implications of the results are discussed. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Allport, G., (1937) Personality: A Psychological Interpretation, , New York, NY, Holt, Rinehart, & Winston; Allport, G.W., Odbert, H.S., Trait names: A psycholexical study (1936) Psychological Monographs, 47, p. 211; Atkinson, J.W., (1964) An Introduction to Motivation, , Princeton, NJ: D., Van Nostrand Co., Inc; Atkinson, J.W., The mainsprings of achievement-oriented activity (1974) Motivation and Achievement, pp. 13-42. , In J.

Study 1 uses exploratory factor analysis to identify a preliminary factor structure. Study 2 uses confirmatory factor analysis to determine whether this factor structure holds across a second sample, as well as structural equation modeling to test hypotheses regarding the associations between communicative responses to jealousy and relational satisfaction. These studies suggest that there are 11 specific communicative responses to jealousy that fall under four superordinate categories: (a) destructive communication, which consists of negative communication, counter-jealousy induction, and violence; (b) constructive communication, which includes integrative communication and compensatory restoration; (c) avoidance, which comprises silence and denial; and (d) rival-focused communication, which includes signs of possession, surveillance, rival contacts, and derogation of the rival. Destructive communication and, to a lesser extent, rival-focused communication associated negatively with relational satisfaction, whereas constructive communication associated positively.

These measures assess automatically activated attitudes, which have the potential to influence spontaneous decisions and outcomes, and may operate, to some extent, below individuals' consciousness. A large number of implicit measures have been developed and tested. These measures use a variety of different procedures and have various strengths and limitations. This piece provides an overview of three types of implicit measures of attitudes: (a) evaluative priming measures, (b) the implicit association test (IAT) and several of its variants, and (c) the recently developed affect misattribution procedure (AMP). Emphasis is placed on issues of mechanism, reliability, validity, and strengths and limitations of each measure. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Bessenoff, G.R., Sherman, J.W., Automatic and controlled component of prejudice toward face people: Evaluation versus stereotype activation (2000) Social Cognition, 18, pp. 329-353; Brendl, M.C., Markman, A.B., Messner, C., How do indirect measures of evaluation work?

Without such a measure it is difficult to evaluate the role these messages play in health promotion or to differentiate them from other message forms. In response to this need, a study was conducted to evaluate the Perception of Narrative Performance Scale that assesses perceptions of narrative health messages. A sample of 1,185 fifth graders in public schools at Phoenix, Arizona, completed a questionnaire rating of two videos presenting narrative substance use prevention messages. Confirmatory factor analyses were computed to identify the factor structure of the scale. Consistent with prior studies, results suggest a three-factor structure for the Perception of Narrative Performance Scale: interest, realism, and identification (with characters). In addition, a path analysis was performed to test the predictive power of the scale. The analysis shows that the scale proves useful in predicting intent to use substances. Finally, practical implications and limitations are discussed. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,"National Institute on Drug Abuse, NIDA

For testing such hypotheses, null hypothesis significance testing (NHST) and the use of effect sizes and confidence intervals (ES+CI) are functionally equivalent. ES+CI provides more precise descriptions of research results (effect sizes, confidence intervals) than does NHST, but that descriptive capability exceeds researchers' current predictive capabilities. Developing more refined predictive capabilities will require making good use of the additional information provided by ES+CI-and careful thinking about how such refined hypotheses might be tested. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Cohen, J., Things I have learned (so far) (1990) American Psychologist, 45, pp. 1304-1312; Cortina, J.M., Dunlap, W.P., On the logic and purpose of significance testing (1997) Psychological Methods, 2, pp. 161-172; Fidler, F., Loftus, G.R., Why figures with error bars should replace p values: Some conceptual arguments and empirical demonstrations (2009) Zeitschrift Fur Psychologie, 217, pp. 27-37; Fidler, F., Thomason, N., Cumming, G., Finch, S., Leeman, J., Editors can lead researchers to confidence intervals, but can't make them think: Statistical reform lessons from medicine (2004) Psychological Science, 15, pp. 119-126; Frick, R.W., Interpreting statistical testing: Process and propensity, not population and random sampling (1998) Behavior Research Methods, Instruments, and Computers, 30, pp. 527-535; Harlow, L.L., Mulaik, S.A., Steiger, J.H., (1997) What If there were No Significance Tests?, , Eds, Mahwah, NJ: Erlbaum; Harris, R.J., Reforming significance testing via three-valued logic (1997) What If there were No Significance Tests?, pp. 145-174. , L.

Previous research began the process with the development of the Motivational Activation Measure (MAM) (A. Lang, Shin, & Lee, 2005; A. Lang, Bradley, Sparks, & Lee, 2007). To calculate MAM, participants view and rate 90 emotional images selected from the International Affective Picture System. The ratings from 35 of those 90 pictures are used to calculate MAM. In this paper, two short versions of the MAM measure, called miniMAM, are developed and their validity assessed. In the first version, participants viewed and rated only the 35 pictures used to calculate MAM. In the second version, participants viewed the 35 pictures used to calculate MAM plus three high arousing negative and three moderately arousing positive pictures chosen from the original MAM measure. The second version is found to be a suitable substitute for MAM when time matters. A third experiment assesses the test re-test reliability of the measure. The results show that motivational reactivity remains stable over time within individuals over a several month period and appears to assess a trait not a state level. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Bradley, M.M., Emotional memory: A dimensional analysis (1994) Emotions: Essays On Emotion Theory, pp. 97-134. , S.

In a partnership with a corporation that hosts an MMO, a 20-person team of scholars is engaged in the study of behavior within a game and also game activities that parallel those in ""real life"" (e.g., economic activity, social networking, group processes). A key aspect of our approach is a unique multidisciplinary collaboration of social and computational scientists to help advance the state of the research. This article discusses the methodological, measurement and organizational challenges of the project, the game, the data, and several representative research streams.

To date, this sampling method has not been validated in longitudinal contexts necessary for the conduct of large-scale health communication research. This study uses Monte Carlo bootstrap sampling to determine the number of constructed weeks necessary to accurately estimate one- and five-year population values for different types of variables in a quantitative content analysis. Five years (1999-2004) of four different daily newspapers were coded for four variables that varied on type (count vs. rating), amount of missing data, and distribution (normal vs. non normal). Results suggest that sampling a minimum of six constructed weeks was most efficient for both time frames. Missing data lowers sampling precision, although a correction can be calculated if the amount of missing data can be estimated. Using an efficient method of sampling newspapers such as constructed week sampling can help communication researchers to more easily study health coverage in the media. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, CDC: U48/CCU710806","This project was funded through the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention contract U48/CCU710806.

This individual difference is expected to facilitate various forms of coercion and aggression in relationships. A means and covariance structures (MACS) approach within the framework of confirmatory factor analysis was conducted on two independent samples of undergraduate students (NA = 292, NB = 317) to cross-validate a previously developed six-factor structure of the Relational Entitlement and Proprietariness (REP) Scale. The analyses successfully validated the REP instrument, evidencing complete measurement invariance across the two samples. Additional tests were performed to explore potential sex differences in the scale. The first-order factor loading pattern of the hierarchical REP structure was largely invariant for the male and female samples. Similarly, the latent mean structure was equivalent for men and women with the exception of 13 observed measures. The findings of this study evidence that the REP measure is a factorially stable and reliable instrument to assess male and female relational entitlement and proprietariness behaviors. © Taylor &amp; Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Bollen, K.A., (1989) Structural Equations With Latent Variables, , New York, NY: Wiley; Browne, M.W., Cudeck, R., Alternative ways of assessing model fit (1993) Testing Structural Equation Models, pp. 136-162. , In K.

Although the validity of simulated recall has been assessed in educational and interpersonal contexts, it is not clear how features of the method influence the measurement of perceptions at different levels of analysis. Participants worked on a task in groups and then viewed a videotape of the interaction. The video was paused for participants to rate each other on several influence measures. Participants were randomly assigned to one of four viewing conditions based on whether participants could see themselves in the video and whether they made self-ratings regarding their participation. Findings revealed that self's visual presence in the video and providing self-ratings had only a minor impact on the distribution of influence ratings. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Albright, L., Malloy, T.E., Self-observation of social behavior and metaperception (1999) Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 77, pp. 726-734; Bloom, B.S., The thought processes of students in discussion (1954) Accent On Teaching: Experiments In General Education, pp. 23-46. , In S.

Although the validity of the thought-listing procedure is well documented, its utility can be limited in situations involving non adult populations and sensitive topics. In this paper, we present a self-reported scale that can be used to assess perceived argument strength in contexts where thought-listing may be less appropriate. This scale taps into perceived argument strength from multiple points of view, including but also extending beyond the potential of the argument to elicit positive and negative thoughts. Reliability and validity of this scale were assessed in health communication contexts involving anti-drug public service announcements (PSAs) directed at adolescents and anti-smoking PSAs targeting adults. Evidence of convergence between this scale and the thought-listing technique was also obtained using the classical comprehensive exam arguments. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,"National Cancer Institute, NCI: P50 CA095856-01

The article first reviews the impulse for development of this content analysis scheme as part of structuration theory work in communication during the late 1970s and early 1980s, especially within the structuration approach to argument in group deliberations. We also position those conceptual efforts in the context of other scholarship at that time on argument in varied forms of social interaction. We next treat three theoretical perspectives on argument that undergird the CACS, including why and how they are integrated in it. Moreover, we note operational developments that occurred after initial formulation of the CACS and outcomes that are offered in the other articles in this issue. More precisely, we discuss and elaborate on various argument structures (i.e., different forms of completed arguments) and argument sequences (i.e., act-to-act patterns of argument behaviors). Finally, we conclude with observations regarding the origins, development, and possible future development of the CACS. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Bradley, P.H., Hamon, C.M., Harris, A.M., Dissent in small groups (1976) Journal of Communication, 26, pp. 155-159; Brockreide, W., Where is argument?

By reviewing this body of literature, one can see the impact of examining relational partners instead of strangers, of investigating dyads rather than groups, and the importance of examining interaction rather than predicting outcomes of arguments based on each relational partner's individual characteristics. This literature also connects argument sequences and structure to relational variables such as relational satisfaction and control mutuality. Three suggested areas for further development of this research include the following topics: family conflict, interpersonal conflict that occurs over mediated channels, and serial arguments in interpersonal relationships. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Bach, G.R., Wyden, P., (1972) The intimate enemy: How to fight fair in love and marriage, , New York: Avon Books; Brashers, D.E., Adkins, M., Meyers, R.A., Argumentation and computer-mediated group decision making (1994) Group communication in context: Studies of natural groups, pp. 263-282. , In L.

First, we discuss the argumentative function of communication in close relationships. Second, we articulate the theoretic cornerstones of our research program. Here we present the basic premises of the theory of Minimally Rational Argument, which identifies conversational argument as a process of developing a definition of the relationship through seeking convergence through rational dialogue. Third, we discuss the method of studying argument building sequences as an important advance in the use of the conversational argument coding scheme. Four types of argument sequences are presented: developing, converging, diverging, and rudimentary. Next, we explore how studying act-to-act argument sequences informs our understanding of relationship communication by presenting four conversational argument patterns as they associate with perceptions of communicator competence, communication satisfaction, and relational quality indicators of satisfaction and control mutuality. Finally, we present ideas for future research that expand upon both our methodological system and how our methodological system can elucidate research in related areas of study. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Aakhus, M., Jackson, S., Technology, interaction, and design (2005) Handbook of language and social interaction, pp. 411-436. , In K.

That relationship also has been true in group argument research conducted by Structuration Argument Theory investigators, especially in their line of work on the quality of arguments in group deliberations. We review the links between SAT and the CACS, focusing specifically on two CACS-based indices of argument quality: the Argument Quality Development Index (consistent with SAT) and the Argument Quality Strength/Force Index (representative of more traditional approaches to argument).

The main purpose is to illustrate how the two coding schemes can complement each other to provide rich yet systematic characterization of argument in jury deliberation. Jury deliberations drawn from In the Jury Room, a televised news series on jury deliberation, are coded and analyzed using CACS and SMAA. The researchers found that using two argument coding schemes is beneficial in learning about the types of arguments jurors make and the subject matter about which they argue. The study results are compared with findings from previous studies of juror argument behavior, suggesting that argument in mediated juries differs from argument in mock juries. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Brossman, B.G., Canary, D.J., An observational analysis of argument structures: The case of Nightline (1990) Argumentation, 4, pp. 199-212; Burnett, A.B., Badzinski, D.M., An exploratory study of argument in the jury decisionmaking process (2000) Communication Quarterly, 48, pp. 380-396; Burnett, A.B., Badzinski, D.M., Judge nonverbal communication on trial: Do jurors notice?

Conflict resolution requires a form of social cooperation that leads to argument and ""good reasons."" Argument based discussion has significant advantages such as it exposes new information, extends the boundaries of individuals by exposing them to others, provides a mode of justification that moves beyond selfish interests and is inclusive of others, and legitimizes decisions. The article also explains how the Conversational Argument Coding Scheme (CACS) can capture issues in argument characteristic of ethnopolitically divided groups. The coding scheme is not concerned with the truth value of arguments but rather with the functional system of argumentative exchanges between conflicting groups. The results from various empirical studies are discussed. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Arreguin-Toft, I., How the weak win wars-a theory of asymmetric conflict (2007) International Security, 26, pp. 93-128; Bohman, J., Political communication and the epistemic value of diversity: Deliberation and legitimation in media societies (2007) Communication Theory, 17, pp. 348-355; Brahm, E., Conflict stages (2003) Beyond intractability, , http://www.beyondintractability.org/essay/conflict_stages/, In G.

The instrument that subsequently emerged (see Canary, Ratledge, & Seibold, 1982)-a version of which appeared for the first time in print several years later (see Canary, Brossman, & Seibold, 1987)-has undergone a good deal of revision, but not at the expense of its utility in helping scholars to unravel the dynamic properties of argumentation as a process in group and interpersonal contexts. If anything, its utility in this respect has expanded by a considerable margin, which is evident from the overviews the four preceding articles in this issue provide. The aim of this article is to reinforce and add perspective to the discussion of what the authors of the preceding contributions consider to be the merits of the CACS. To that end, the commentary examines and offers a separate reaction to each of the four manuscripts, as well as considers what might have enhanced the value of the contents for those readers interested in conversational argument and how best to study it. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Canary, D.J., Brossman, B.G., Seibold, D.R., Argument structures in decision-making groups (1987) Southern Speech Communication Journal, 53, pp. 18-37; Canary, D.J., Ratledge, N.T., Seibold, D.R., Argument and group decision making: Development of a coding scheme (1982) Annual convention of the Speech Communication Association, , November, Paper presented at the, Louisville, KY; Canary, D.J., Weger Jr., H., An observational analysis of argument sequences and assessments of communication quality: A minimally rational perspective (2009) Concerning argument: Selected papers from the 15th biennial conference on argumentation, pp. 95-109. , In S.

The present research aimed to assess the measurement properties of an expanded set of social exchange constructs. The measurement properties of change communication, communication climate, perceived organizational support, procedural justice, affective commitment, and cynicism toward organizational change were tested using competing confirmatory factor analytic models. After appropriately defining items and refining individual scales, confirmatory factor analyses provided evidence in support of an expanded set of social exchange constructs. Despite high correlations between some of the variables, tests for discriminant validity established that respondents (N = 500) could reliably distinguish between the full set of constructs. Furthermore, Harman's One Factor Test for common method variance suggested that the variance in the data could not be explained by a single construct. Practical implications for the use of this set of social exchange constructs in organizational contexts are discussed.

This article introduces communication researchers to a new class of social network analysis methods, exponential random graph (p*) models. This new method represents the latest advancement in social network methodology and will enhance the trajectory of social network research in the communication discipline. The benefits of this class of models include allowing for the simultaneous estimation of attribute and structural parameters, accounting for the interdependent nature of network data, and retaining the complexity of network observations throughout the analysis. An example analysis using data from Shumate, Fulk, and Monge (2005) is provided to illustrate the potentials of exponential random graph modeling.

The study reported here provides new validation evidence, collected during actual rather than hypothetical discussions. Each participant interacted with two confederates about a controversial topic. The confederates were trained to produce a discussion climate that was either consistent or inconsistent with the participant's own opinion on the topic. The manipulation of the climate of opinion affected opinion expression only among dispositional self-censors (i.e., those scoring relatively higher on the scale), even after controlling for dispositional shyness. As expected, people who scored relatively low were unaffected by information about the climate of opinion. These results further attest to the construct validity of the Willingness to Self-Censor Scale.

For discourse analysts, interviewing is often judged to be both overused and poorly used; to understand communicative life, researchers should be observing interaction rather than asking people to report their stories, experiences, or beliefs. As discourse scholars we agree with many of the criticisms fellow discourse scholars have made, but we disagree that interviewing should be avoided. Our paper has two purposes. The first is to describe an interview design and interpretation issue that needs attention. The issue is the effect of an interviewer's institutional positioning on interview answers, a concern that only becomes visible when we look at actual interview interaction. The second purpose is to sketch out an approach that takes interview interaction and the troubles that arise in it seriously while also addressing the substantive topics/issues that motivated interviewing in the first place. After reviewing the major challenges of research interviewing, we analyze interview excerpts in two different research projects. We show how interviewers' institutional positionings caused misalignment and interactional trouble. In the conclusion we consider how to understand and use these kinds of unavoidable interactional troubles to arrive at interesting and persuasive interpretations of the topical foci of interviews.

Using an example from an ethnographic study of intergroup conflict in joint product development, this paper supports the argument that doing ethnography is necessary to find and analyze empirical evidence for what CAS theory illuminates about the social world. I extend this argument by discussing its importance for communication research. A key question for communication researchers is how system-level events in complex social systems are grounded in and produced by local interactions among individuals. This paper describes and illustrates some important insights that researchers can gain into this question by paying attention to the parallels between CAS theory and ethnography in the investigations of complex communicative phenomena.

The results are reported here for two original studies designed to reconstruct a previously validated measure for television memory constructed to assess how people forget information over time. The remote television memory test assesses recognition memory for the titles of broadcast television programs canceled after a single season. Results from two studies show that the measure is reliable across repeated administrations among independent samples, exhibits a forgetting curve over time, is uncorrelated with total television viewing, appears to be approximately normally distributed, and predicts social reality estimates typical of the cultivation effect independently from total viewing. More work is needed to further assess the construct validity of the measure. Practical implications of administration also are discussed.

However, the PA reflex has not been examined during television viewing. The goal of this study was to examine whether the PA reflex may serve as a useful indicator of emotional responding to television content. PA reflexes were measured while experimental participants viewed television advertisements varying in emotional valence (pleasant and unpleasant) and arousal (high and low). The PA reflexes were greatest during viewing of pleasant television advertisements that were highest in arousal. The findings replicated recent results and provided further validation that the PA reflex may indicate strength of activation in the human appetitive motivational system. The results provide new evidence demonstrating the measure's potential validity for mass communication researchers. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Agung, K., Purdy, S.C., Patuzzi, R.B., O'Beirne, G.A., Newall, P., Rising-frequency chirps and earphones with an extended high-frequency response enhance the post-auricular muscle response (2005) International Journal of Audiology, 44 (11), pp. 631-636; Ames, K.M., Merritt, N.P., Stout, K., Hetrick, W.P., Differential effects of affective modulation on orbicularis and post-auricular indices of startle (2003) Psychophysiology, 40, pp. S22; Anderson, P.A., Guerrero, L.K., (1998) Handbook of communication and emotion: Research, theory, applications, and contexts, , (Eds.)., San Diego, CA: Academic Press; Benning, S.D., Bernat, E.M., Starr, M.J., Gewirtz, J.C., Patrick, C.J., Post-auricular reflex potentiation during relief stimuli in differential aversive conditioning: A construct validation study (2004) Psychophysiology, 41, pp. S3-S4; Benning, S.D., Patrick, C.J., Lang, A.R., Emotional modulation of the post-auricular reflex (2004) Psychophysiology, 41 (3), pp. 426-432; Benning, S.D., Quevedo, K.M., Dahl, R.E., Gunnar, M.R., Effects of personality traits on startle blink and postauricular reflex modulation in adolescents (2007) Psychophysiology, 44, pp. S23; Bernat, E.M., Patrick, C.J., Hall, J.R., Steffen, B.V., Venables, N.C., Benning, S.D., Emotional post-auricular reflex modulation in community and incarcerated males (2004) Psychophysiology, 41, pp. S3; Bickford, R.G., Jacobson, J.L., Cody, T.R., Nature of average evoked potentials to sound and other stimuli in man (1964) Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences, 112, pp. 204-223; Biocca, F., David, P., West, M., Continuous response measurement (CRM): A computerized tool for research on cognitive processing of communication messages (1994) Measuring psychological responses to media, , In A.

Theory and research into the organization, storage, and retrieval of long-term memory are used to develop a scale for measuring past and present television exposure levels. In a survey of 207 young adults, a Lifetime Television Exposure (LTE) scale is submitted to tests of criterion validity. Findings show the scale positively predicts cultivation outcomes above and beyond existing measures of current television exposure. Television viewing during early childhood, in particular, predicts young adults' current social reality beliefs. Methodological considerations and directions for future research are discussed.

Via a democratizing of the research process, photovoice can significantly affect the study of communication. Originally proposed by Wang and Burris (1994), photovoice traditionally has been used to study the social worlds of marginalized persons (e.g., rural, learning disabled, people without homes). Photovoice is a method in which participants use cameras to document their daily lives. The photographs function as artifacts around which an in-depth interview and/or focus group is centered. In this essay, I trace the history of images in social-scientific research generally and photovoice specifically. I then discuss the setup, execution of, and challenges of a photovoice project. I conclude with examples of photovoice from my own research which highlight the potential of photovoice-generated data to inform the study of human communication. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Communication scholars' narratives of IRB experiences (2005) Journal of Applied Communication Research, 33, pp. 204-230. , Anonymous; Ashcraft, K.L., Mumby, D.K., (2004) Reworking gender: A feminist communicology of organization, , Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage; Beach, W.A., LeBaron, C.D., Body disclosures: Attending to personal problems and reported sexual abuse during a medical encounter (2002) Journal of Communication, 52, pp. 617-639; Cheney, G., Cloud, D., Doing democracy, engaging the material.

Each revision has attempted to improve the scheme, apply it in a different context, or submit its data to unique analyses. All of these combined efforts have increased the scheme's utility, reliability, and validity. As part of this series of articles that trace the history of the CAS and speculate on its future, three revisions to the scheme are discussed: (a) adding categories, (b) establishing unitizing rules, and (c) creating a multistage coding process. The benefits and limits of these extensions are discussed and directions for future work involving the CAS suggested. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Auld, F., White, A.M., Rules for dividing interviews into sentences (1956) Journal of Psychology, 42, pp. 273-281; Barge, J.K., Enlarging the meaning of group deliberation: From discussion to dialogue (2002) New directions in group communication, pp. 159-178. , In L.
