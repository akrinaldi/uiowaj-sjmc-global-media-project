With access to green facilities comes the potential to extend informal science learning into the three-dimensional architectural environment. To examine how and if museums with green buildings interpret their buildings for the public, this study used photographs systematically taken by researchers in eight science museums across the United States. Results show that recycling, water, energy, green materials, and eco-landscaping were the top five green building themes interpreted by museums. Moreover, all museums use the passive strategy of educational signage to communicate green building themes, though several museums attempted to provide more active, hands-on learning opportunities. The analysis additionally uncovered a series of distinct strategic choices museums made concerning centralized versus decentralized displays, media types, passive versus active engagement, and targeting a range of visitor outcomes from green knowledge to behaviors. The potential for enhancing green building education in museums with certified green buildings is discussed. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Green buildings; informal environmental education; informal science education; LEED; science museum",,,,,,,"University of Missouri Research Council; Environmental Design Research Association Michael Brill Award; University of Colorado?s Undergraduate Research Opportunities Fund.",,,,"Abbey, H.N., The green archivist: A primer for adopting affordable, environmentally sustainable, and socially responsible archival management practices (2012) Archival Issues, 34 (2), pp. 91-115; Abrahamse, W., Steg, L., Vlek, C., Rothengatter, T., A review of intervention studies aimed at household energy conservation (2005) Journal of Environmental Psychology, 25 (3), pp. 273-291; Anderson, H.G., (2007) Mainstreaming green’: Disseminating knowledge about sustainable design through interactive and multi-sensory exposition, , https://search.proquest.com/pqdt/docview/304780996/abstract/A2E09BFBF4A84042PQ/3, ‘ (M.I.D., University of Manitoba (Canada)).

This self-selection represents a major challenge for broadening participation in informal science learning (ISL). In this study, we examine an approach to ISL that aims at reaching audiences who may not ordinarily engage with science. Termed Guerilla Science, this approach blends elements of access, by removing barriers to participation by embedding science into unexpected places, with those of inclusion, by designing activities that speak to the learning identities of participants. Our research investigated whether such ISL experience are indeed able to attract and engage ‘new’ audiences. In this study, Guerilla Science events were featured at the Oregon Eclipse Festival, a large multi-day music and arts festival. We conducted a multi-method study that included participants of the Oregon Eclipse Festival who engaged with Guerilla Science events, and those who did not, with a focus of understanding whether these two groups were different in key characteristics associated with their interest in, and engagement with science. The full range of festival goers, from those with little connection and interest in science to science enthusiasts, who participated in Guerilla Science, were similar to festival goers overall, indicating the effectiveness of the approach for engaging adults from beyond the science choir. Providing access points to science engagement within non-science cultural contexts and designing the science experiences to align with cultural identity of the audience represents an evidence-based practice for broadening participation. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","art-science collaboration; broadening participation; cultural festival; Informal science learning; public engagement; science communication",,,,,,"National Science Foundation, NSF: 1612719

This triggers processes where acting and knowing go hand-in-hand to involve each person as a whole. This requires physical, intellectual and emotional interaction to recreate various science aspects, such as knowledge, history, challenges and controversies. Just as SRWs are collective efforts, as public activities, they are usually promoted by groups as well. But, to the contrary of what happens in SRW with the public, it is common that the group efforts are more geared towards practice than theory. They prioritize working with the public rather than discussing the theoretical and methodological foundations for SRW, or their main challenges as they seek to train new members, evaluate their performance or create new activities. Groups interact with each other, however, this has only led to collaboration on projects rather than to a significant formal discussion. This article focuses specifically on SRW groups in Mexico, as a case study of an emerging community of practice. Data from active organizations were collected in 2009 and 2019, allowing us to compare the situation in these two periods of time and provides perspective on the community’s evolution. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","experience-based science activities; public communication of science and technology; science communities of practice; Science recreation workshops",,,,,,,,,,,"Anastopoulou, S., Sharples, M., Ainsworth, S., Crook, C., O’Malley, C., Wright, M., Creating personal meaning through technology-supported science inquiry learning across formal and informal settings (2012) International Journal of Science Education, 34 (2), pp. 251-273; Bell, P., Lewenstein, B., Shouse, A., Feder, M., (2009) Learning science in informal environments: People, places, and pursuits, , Washington, DC: National Academies Press, &, (Eds; (2015) Identifying and supporting productive stem programs in out-of-school settings, , Washington, DC: National Academies Press; Dalkir, K., (2005) Knowledge management in theory and practice, , Amsterdam: Elsevier/Butterworth Heinemann; Dewey, J., The American association for the advancement of science as subject-matter and as method (1910) Science, 31 (787), pp. 121-127. , Retrieved from JSTOR; Dewey, J., (1958) Experience and nature, , Courier Corporation; Falk, J.H., Dierking, L.D., (2000) Learning from museums, , Lanham: AltaMira Press; Fenichel, M., Schweingruber, H., (2010) Surrounded by science: Learning science in informal environments; Feynman, R.P., (2011) Six easy pieces: Essentials of physics explained by its most brilliant teacher, , New York, NY: Basic Books, a member of the Perseus Books group; French, D.P., Was “inquiry” a mistake?

By expanding on the STEM learning ecosystem focused on youth’s structured learning, we explore settings where lifelong learners encounter STEM in their daily lives. We conducted a nationwide study with the US public describing where and how people engage with STEM. Results show that the public encounters each STEM discipline with similar frequency in various informal settings. Settings resonate uniquely with the public regarding STEM disciplines, topics, and modes of learning. Specifically, science centres are the standard for informal STEM learning, and are associated most closely with the experiences outlined above. Other informal learning centres are perceived to cover aspects of that ecology. Zoos are seen as places to learn most about animals and related topics (e.g., animal behaviour), and aquariums for teaching about water quality. Comparatively, science centres are thought to provide opportunities to learn about broader STEM topics, including climate change. We highlight that informal learning settings can advance STEM learning by explicitly prioritizing each STEM discipline in programmes, and by identifying strategies to measure the public’s informal STEM learning. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","informal education; learning environment; Public understanding of science",,,,,,"National Science Foundation, NSF: DRK-1612729, DRK-1612699

The play included in this study was generated as a part of a design research project with a collaborative community comprised of artists, scientists, educators, and researchers. The design and implementation of this cross-disciplinary intervention and the research included in this study represent the design team’s initial attempts to better understand youths’ response to dramatic productions, and specifically which characters’ practices youth ‘count’ as scientific. The design and goals of the project are described, followed by an analysis of focus group interviews with students (N = 65), which were conducted after watching the play. Despite the design team’s intentions, findings highlight that the majority of students included in this study recognised a narrow range of practices taking place in the play as scientific, which led to a process of re-examination, complication, and interrogation the findings and design. Guided by Butler’s theory of performativity, this paper is used as a reflection space in order to theorise this work in a new direction. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","grade 6; grade 7; grade 8; Middle schools; public understanding of science; science practices; science theatre",,,,,,"Robert J.

Regular and transparent assessment of volunteers’ science inquiry skills can support these goals, but we lack a comprehensive understanding of how these skills are assessed. To address this gap, we collected data from citizen science project leaders through questionnaires, interviews and a systematic literature review. Findings demonstrated that most projects targeted a narrow range of skills that centered on data collection. About half of questionnaire and interview respondents stated that they assess science inquiry skills, but many relied on informal or indirect methods such as observations and conversations lacking protocols. Less than a third of these respondents and only 13% of reviewed articles administered formal assessments of skills, such as tests and performance measures based on volunteers’ submitted data. Challenges associated with skill assessment included lack of time, staff, expertise, funding and supporting resources. Overall, our study provides clear evidence of the limited breadth and assessment of skills targeted within citizen science, and points to the need for resources that promote and expand the use of assessment addressing science inquiry skills. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Assessment; citizen science; data validation; embedded assessment; science inquiry skills",,,,,,"National Science Foundation, NSF: 1422099","This work was supported by the National Science Foundation under [grant number DRL?1422099].

The participants consisted of 12 physics researchers who conduct research in the field of nanoscale science and technology (NST). The guided discourse consisted of a professional development task for preparing the researchers to communicate their NST research. Each scientist was presented with two sets of concepts (NST essential concepts and middle school physics concepts) using a visual board and was asked to find connections between them. Before and after linking the two sets of concepts, the scientists were invited to describe their research. The findings showed that a change had taken place in the concepts the scientists used to describe their research: an increased use of concepts from middle school physics and a decreased use of complex scientific jargon. A qualitative examination of the results revealed different types of participants, based on the way the scientists were influenced by the task. Each of the three types of science communicators is presented as a case study. We suggest that this task can be applied to prepare scientists to communicate with middle school students. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","science communication; Scientists; skill development, nanoeducation, nanoscale science and technology",,,,,,,,,,,"Baram-Tsabari, A., Lewenstein, B.V., An instrument for assessing scientists’ written skills in public communication of science (2013) Science Communication, 35 (1), pp. 56-85. , https://doi.org/10.1177/1075547012440634; Baram-Tsabari, A., Lewenstein, B.V., Preparing scientists to be science communicators (2017) Preparing Informal Science Educators: Perspectives from Science Communication and Education, pp. 437-471. , Patrick P.G., (ed), Cham: Springer International Publishing, &,.

Ten gifted and talented students participated in this study, Youth Science and Technology Leadership Camp (YSTLC). A leadership test was developed and implemented to the participants as a pre-test and post-test. The daily reports and interviews at the end of the camp examined their understanding of personal openness and attitudes toward being scientists and engineers. The enrichment program YSTLC improved their leadership and their knowledge of and attitude toward science and engineering for their future careers. This research highlights the importance of developing enrichment programs with a framework of effective methodologies that can be used to educate gifted and talented students, including minority students, to develop strong leadership skills, scientific knowledge, and perspicuous visions for their future. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","academic achievement; enrichment; Gifted & talented students; leadership; STEM education",,,,,,"Goddard Space Flight Center, GSFC

The central component of the model was a cadre of community members known as ‘STEM Guides’ who were hired to work as brokers between youth and the STEM learning resources potentially available to them. These STEM Guides were respected adults with credible connections to youth, flexible schedules, the ability to travel within the community, and enthusiasm for identifying local STEM resources. The Guides were trained and supported by the project staff of an educational research and development non-profit, whose researchers studied the Guides’ experiences over several years as they reflected on the ways they could support youth to pursue STEM outside of school. This project was unusual in developing embedded rural residents to take a professional brokering role with youth aged 10–18 throughout a region of several neighbouring towns, instead of relying on parents or teachers to provide such connections opportunistically and only for their own youth. Taking an ecosystems perspective, this article highlights some of the opportunities and challenges these STEM brokers faced as they tried to catalyze connections for youth in their communities. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","brokering; community engagement; learning ecosystems; rural education",,,,,,"National Science Foundation, NSF: 1322827","This material is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation [grant number 1322827].

However, what type of learning takes place on these visits, and how effective it is, is an area that merits more academic study. This paper investigates these questions from the perspective of three groups–teachers, pupils and festival organisers–and asks how well the attitudes and priorities of these categories are aligned. We find that teachers and organisers share the primary aim of affective learning (excitement, inspiration) and that this is experienced by almost all pupils. A secondary aim of cognitive (factual) learning is reported by just under half of pupils. However a third aim of careers learning which was expressed by festival organisers and some teachers was not reported by pupil participants. In addition, we found that the groups could work more effectively together to promote educational aims by measures such as reducing the novelty of the event situation and making educational agendas for the visit clearer. Finally, to address the areas of misalignment pinpointed in this study, we give a series of recommendations to optimise learning at such events. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","out of school learning; public engagement; public understanding of science; Science festivals",,,,,,,,,,,"Anderson, L.W., Krathwohl, D.R., Airasian, P.W., Cruikshank, K.A., Mayer, R.E., Pintrich, P.R., Wittrock, M.C., (2001) A taxonomy for learning, teaching and assessing: A revision of bloom’ s taxonomy of educational objectives, 83. , Spring, New York: Longman, …; Anderson, D., Lucas, K.B., The effectiveness of orienting students to the physical features of a science museum prior to visitation (1997) Research in Science Education, 27 (4), pp. 485-495; Anderson, D., Lucas, K.B., Ginns, I.S., Dierking, L.D., Development of knowledge about electricity and magnetism during a visit to a science museum and related post-visit activities (2000) Science Education, 84 (5), pp. 658-679; Archer, L., Dawson, E., Seakins, A., DeWitt, J., Godec, S., Whitby, C., “I’m being a man here”: urban boys’ performances of masculinity and engagement with science during a science museum visit (2016) Journal of the Learning Sciences, 25 (3), pp. 438-485; Belin, C., (2018) Formal learning in an informal setting: The cognitive and affective impacts of visiting a science center during a school field trip, , Retrieved from scholarworks.uark.edu/etd/2701; Bultitude, K., McDonald, D., Custead, S., The rise and rise of science festivals: An international review of organised events to celebrate science (2011) International Journal of Science Education, Part B, 1 (2), pp. 165-188; Canovan, C., “Going to these events truly opens your eyes”.

The study findings reveal that even though the CBC has been introduced in different SSA countries to enhance the quality of education, the science curriculum is still implemented in traditional ways. Consequently, CBC is not effectively addressing socio-economic needs as intended, at both individual and national level. The authors are concerned with how CBC is being implemented in other SSA countries that recently have adopted this kind of curriculum and how it will be implemented in other SSA countries that are planning to embrace it. In this paper, the authors suggest ways the new ideas could be introduced and reflect on how CBC can be implemented in SSA countries that share socio-economic and environmental similarities. They finally strongly recommend the establishment of special ‘laboratory’ schools or science education centres as well as school-based communities of practice to enhance teachers’ content knowledge and nurture contemporary teaching methods for the successful implementation of the new ideas. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Competence-based curriculum; reflection; science curriculum implementation; Sub-Saharan Africa",,,,,,,"Our thanks go to Professor John M.

This study focuses on the role of epistemic beliefs in predicting citizen engagement with science and technology. In accordance with theories of learning and domain knowledge acquisition, the findings highlight the potential importance of epistemic beliefs in motivating individuals to be interested in and to consume informative media content related to science and technology. The analyses confirm that certain cognitive dispositions and epistemic beliefs substantially increase the ability to explain variation in citizens’ interest in science and technology and consumption of related news content. If the relationships we observe represent causal effects, enhancing epistemic motivations might be an effective strategy in achieving science communication’s goal of cultivating interest and promoting citizen engagement with science and technology. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","cognitive traits; engagement with science and technology; Epistemic beliefs; science communication",,,,,,,,,,,"Ackerman, P.L., A theory of adult intellectual development: Process, personality, interests, and knowledge (1996) Intelligence, 22 (2), pp. 227-257. , https://doi.org/10.1016/S0160-2896(96)90016-1; Ackerman, P.L., Cognitive ability and non-ability trait determinants of expertise (2003) Educational Researcher, 32 (8), pp. 15-20. , https://doi.org/10.3102/0013189X032008015; Ackerman, P.L., Kanfer, R., Beier, M.E., Trait complex, cognitive ability, and domain knowledge predictors of baccalaureate success, STEM persistence, and gender differences (2013) Journal of Educational Psychology, 105 (3), pp. 911-927. , https://doi.org/10.1037/a0032338; Andridge, R.R., Little, R.J.A., A review of hot deck imputation for survey non-response (2010) International Statistical Review, 78 (1), pp. 40-64. , https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1751-5823.2010.00103.x; Arceneaux, K., Vander Wielen, R.J., (2018) Taming intuition: How reflection minimizes partisan reasoning and promotes democratic accountability, , Cambridge University Press; Arnone, M.P., Small, R.V., Chauncey, S.A., McKenna, H.P., Curiosity, interest and engagement in technology-pervasive learning environments: A new research agenda (2011) Educational Technology Research and Development, 59 (2), pp. 181-198. , https://doi.org/10.1007/s11423-011-9190-9; Baram-Tsabari, A., Lewenstein, B.V., Science communication training: What are we trying to teach?

However, data availability does not guarantee public use or the relevance of these resources. This paper addresses the ways in which non-expert adults involved in a citizen science initiative, perceive, understand and use its scientific information. Participants responded to an online questionnaire presenting air quality data from ‘Sensing the Air’ citizen science platform, followed by interpretation questions (n = 123). The results showed that 70% of participants were able to interpret the data presented in various visual representations. No differences were found between gender, age or education level. However, respondents with tertiary scientific education obtained higher average scores. Among users who had previous experience with the project, overall scores were higher, and differences based on respondents scientific education were fewer. This may suggest that while scientific education is important in providing skills for data interpretation, it is not the only way to acquire these skills. This study highlights the ability of non-experts to understand and apply scientific data in daily situations and the potential of citizen science to develop scientific skills, competencies and public understanding of science. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","air quality; citizen science; Public understanding of science; science literacy",,,,,,,,,,,"Albagli, S., Maciel, M.L., Abdo, A.H., (2015) Open science, open issues, , IBICT; Allchin, D., From science studies to scientific literacy: A view from the classroom (2014) Science and Education, 23 (9), pp. 1911-1932. , https://doi.org/10.1007/s11191-013-9672-8; Archer-Bradshaw, R.E., Teaching for scientific literacy?

However, research has shown that attendees at such events tend to be more affluent, better-educated and more interested in science than populations at large. This has led to calls for research into how festivals can widen participation beyond the already engaged. This paper details the efforts of one festival to attract a more diverse audience through the use of a targeted ‘Community Pass’, offering attendees a free lunch, as well as by undertaking analysis of the characteristics that made individuals more likely to attend. The research shows that such a scheme can attract a very different audience to visit, albeit on a small scale due to cost implications. Working with existing community groups was shown to be the most effective method of distributing the passes, with recipients valuing a personal interaction with the distributor. There is also some suggestion that the incentive might nudge audiences who had a ‘fragile’ intention to attend the festival into actually visiting. However, more research is needed into whether larger-scale measures, such as employing community outreach officers, could have a more significant effect on overall attendance profiles. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","public engagement with science; science capital; Science festivals; widening participation",,,,,,,,,,,"Archer, L., Dawson, E., DeWitt, J., Seakins, A., Wong, B., “Science capital”: A conceptual, methodological, and empirical argument for extending bourdieusian notions of capital beyond the arts (2015) Journal of Research in Science Teaching, 52 (7), pp. 922-948. , https://doi.org/10.1002/tea.21227; Archer, L., DeWitt, J., Osborne, J., Dillon, J., Willis, B., Wong, B., Science aspirations, capital, and family habitus: How families shape children’s engagement and identification with science (2012) American Educational Research Journal, 49 (5), pp. 881-908. , https://doi.org/10.3102/0002831211433290; (2016) Taking charge - Evaluating the evidence: The impact of charging or not for admissions on museums, , https://www.aim-museums.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Executive-Summary-Taking-Charge-%E2%80%93-Evaluating-the-Evidence-The-Impact-of-Charging-or-Not-for-Admissions-on-Museums.pdf; Bultitude, K., Science festivals: Do they succeed in reaching beyond the “already engaged”?

The goal of this camp has been to enhance pathways to science and health science careers for high school students aged 13–15 years-old. The camp's core curriculum exposes youth to science and health sciences through fun and engaging activities. Students consistently reported that the camp helped strengthen connections between their learning in secondary school, potential university level education, and future career options in science and health science. This camp has been well received across British Columbia Aboriginal communities as evidenced by increasing enrollments and community member participation. As faculty and staff involved in the 10-year history of the summer camp, we reflect on our work for the purpose of informing others concerned with promoting science and health science careers for Aboriginal youth. Given a gap in the literature around planning and delivering successful science and health science-focused summer camps for Aboriginal youth, we offer this account of our successes and lessons learned for those planning or already engaged in implementing similar educational efforts. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Aboriginal and First Nations; biology; educational and experiential learning; health science; Indigenous student development; K-12 STEM outreach; nursing; pathways to postsecondary education; science",,,,,,"Health Canada","The costs of running the camp have remained relatively constant over the years, however securing adequate and sustainable funding has been one of the main challenges for organizers. Over the 10 year-experience, organizers have witnessed the annual camp budget fluctuate between $15,000 and $20,000. Key budgetary items include salaries, honoraria for Elders, speaker fees, accommodations, meals, costs for field trips and recreational activities, and bursaries for campers who require financial support. Through the years, the camp has been funded by the camper registration fees ($175/person) and differing collated sources of academic, industry, and scientific origins. Initial funding was secured through an AHHRI grant made available through Health Canada. In more recent years, substantive funding was secured through the TRU Eureka program, sponsorship from the local School District, the Vancouver Foundation, Science World (through their main granting agency Telus Communications), Genome BC, and Domtar Corporation. The TRU Office of Aboriginal Education, FOSc and SON have consistently provided matching funding as well as in-kind support for faculty and support staff time, laboratory supplies, printing, posters and other equipment. Most of the campers have been members of a First Nation and have been able to access Band 3 sponsorship. So although the registration fees, financial and in-kind support from the TRU Office of Aboriginal Affairs and FOSc and SON are relatively stable, additional sources have always been necessary for ensuring the camp operates according to its mandate. Educational initiatives aimed at improving outcomes for Aboriginal peoples are vulnerable to year to year funding discrepancies and the shifting fiscal priorities of governments and other funders (Curtis et al., 2012 ; Curtis & Reid, 2013 ; Indspire, 2018 ; Pidgeon, 2016 ). As a result, the organizing committee has strongly recommended that the university seek or allocate secure and stable funding.",,,,"(2017) 2016/2017 annual report, , https://www.actua.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Actua_AR_2016-17.pdf; Aldous, C.R., Barnes, A., Clark, J.A., Engaging excellent Aboriginal students in science: An innovation in culturally inclusive schooling (2008) Teaching Science, 54 (4), pp. 35-39; Anonson, J., Desjarlais, J., Nixon, J., Whiteman, L., Bird, A., Strategies to support recruitment and retention of first Nations youth in baccalaureate nursing programs in Saskatchewan, Canada (2008) Journal of Transcultural Nursing, 19 (3), pp. 274-283. , https://doi.org/10.1177/1043659608317095; Bartlett, C., Marshall, M., Marshall, A., Two-Eyed seeing and other lessons learned within a co-learning journey of bringing together indigenous and mainstream knowledges and ways of knowing (2012) Journal of Environmental Studies and Sciences, 2 (4), pp. 331-340. , https://doi.org/10.1007/s13412-012-0086-8; Bell, N., (2019), https://www.oise.utoronto.ca/deepeningknowledge/Teacher_Resources/Curriculum_Resources_(by_subjects)/Social_Sciences_and_Humanities/Elders.html; Blotnicky, K.A., Franz-Odendaal, T., French, F., Joy, P., A study of the correlation between STEM career knowledge, mathematics self-efficacy, career interests, and career activities on the likelihood of pursuing a STEM career among middle school students (2018) International Journal of STEM Education, 5 (1), p. 22. , https://doi.org/10.1186/s40594-018-0118-3; Bonny, S.M., Effective STEM outreach for Indigenous community contexts –getting it right, one community at a time (2018) International Journal of Innovation in Science and Mathematics Education, 26 (2), pp. 14-34; (2015), http://www.cihr-irsc.gc.ca, Tri-Council Policy Statement: Ethical conduct for research involving humans-Chapter 9: Research involving First Nations, Inuit and Metis Peoples of Canada.

However, academic outreach often only reaches an already-science-attentive audience through traditional museum visits or lecture-style presentations. Even programs designed to take advantage of public spaces may still pose barriers to non-traditional audiences, particularly in terms of time and money to attend. We designed a program to promote public engagement with science through casual conversations with pairs of scientists meeting public patrons in everyday and leisure spaces such as bars, coffeehouses, libraries, and laundromats, in both urban and rural locations. We conducted unobtrusive observations of these events at two time points as a case study and used thematic analysis to characterize the patterns of utterances, content of utterances, body positions, and object interactions with 29 groups. We found instances of high, medium, and low engagement, and describe characteristics of each type. We present example cases and suggest their use during professional development with scientists for public engagement and reflective practice. Overall, these conversations show promise for high public engagement with science and opportunities for true mutual learning between scientists and non-traditional public audiences. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","case study; everyday spaces; leisure spaces; observation; Public engagement with science; scientific outreach",,,,,,"National Science Foundation, NSF: OCE 1038990","This work was supported by the National Science Foundation under Grant OCE 1038990.

It uses a pragmatic mixed-method approach to present a critical analysis of the potential role of science communication videos to manage participant expectations. Drawing on 30 years of science research on whale watching the empirical study produces an original science communication video. The video was then tested empirically (N = 1698) employing an experimental Test and Control group design. The results highlight that science communication videos can serve as educational management tools for sustainable tourism, and influence people towards responsible whale watching behavior. Furthermore, the results are a clarion call to increase visual research methods in science communication studies in response to our rapidly changing media-environment. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","filmmaking; science communication; science education; sustainable tourism; visual research; Whale watching",,,,,,,"The authors would like to thank the Department of Tourism, University of Otago (New Zealand) as well as the Diane Campbell Memorial award for supporting this research.

Scientists untrained in filmmaking most often choose the expository mode since it possesses the same traits and conventions as used in most scientific narratives. Yet, this need not be the case given that a new generation of ‘scientists-as-filmmakers’, can be taught to appreciate and apply other documentary modes. In this study, we surveyed the possible documentary modes that scientists from nine Swiss universities and research centres would use, both before and after studying filmmaking courses. As expected, before the start of the courses, the majority of the participants (83.33%) said they would use the expository mode, while 27.45% said they would use the observational mode. However, after attending the filmmaking courses, the number of participants interested in the expository mode fell almost by half, while the number of participants who said they would use the observational mode almost doubled. Unexpectedly, after the course the most chosen mode was the poetic (70.58%), and there was also fair amount of interest in the participatory (38.23%) and reflexive (17.64%) modes. The films produced in the future by the generation of ‘scientists-as-filmmakers’ will contain a much greater variety of documentary modes. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Documentary mode; expository mode; film course; observational mode; participatory mode; performative mode; poetic mode; reflexive mode",,,,,,,,,,,"Angelone, S., A new generation of scientists-as-filmmakers: Experiences gained in Switzerland (2019) Science Communication, 41 (3), pp. 369-377; Angelone, S., Soriguer, R.C., Melendo, A., Filmmaking courses for scientists help promote richer alternatives to chronological narratives (2019) Studies in Higher Education; Boon, T., Formal conventions in British science television, 1955-1966 (2014) Actes d’Història de la Ciència i de la Tècnica, 7, pp. 51-69; Bucchi, M., Style in science communication (2013) Public Understanding of Science, 22 (8), pp. 904-915; Bultitude, K., McDonald, D., Custead, S., The rise and rise of science festivals: An international review of organised events to celebrate science (2011) International Journal of Science Education Part B, 1 (2), pp. 165-188; Burns, T.W., O'Connor, D.J., Stocklmayer, S.M., Science communication: A contemporary definition (2003) Public Understanding of Science, 12, pp. 183-202; Put it on camera: How to get into scientific film- and video-making (2018) Nature, 553, pp. 117-119; Carta, S., Visual and experiential knowledge in observational cinema (2015) Anthrovision.

This study analyzed the ethical expressions in 1079 reader comments to online news coverage of animal experimentation and climate change in Israel. Some forms of ethical concerns were expressed in many reader comments following animal experimentation (70%) and climate change (47%) coverage. Opposition to animal experimentation was primarily expressed emotionally, whereas comments supporting these experiments and complex stances towards them were mainly couched in ethical reasoning. Ethical expressions related to climate change primarily drew on ethical concepts. The importance of trust in scientific practice and institutions was evident in both issues. Formal ethics, as expressed by using ethical concepts or ethical reasoning, were found to be present in public discourse, suggesting it can serve as a foundation to enhance public engagement with bioethics. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","bioethics; online discussions; Public engagement with science",,,,,,,,,,,"Alvarez, A.A.A., How rational should bioethics be?

However, acting as a scientist-in-role, making independent decisions about what information to collect and deciding how to go about it, can enable students to experience scientific practices that empower them to better appreciate and understand the NoS. This paper illustrates how drama processes, in two international settings in Wellington, New Zealand and Oxford, United Kingdom encouraged nine to ten-year-old children to engage in the scientific ‘as-if’ world. The data collected from these two locations was analysed deductively to illustrate how working-in-role can influence the nature of learning and shape the scientific practices experienced that consequently inform how the NoS is understood. The children in Wellington (New Zealand) worked in-role as atmospheric scientists to design a reduced-emissions race track. The class in Oxford (UK) adopted the role of technological scientists theorising about properties of materials to create and test original carriers designed to transport a range of everyday objects. How drama promoted working-in-role to experience scientific practices supporting the understanding of the NoS, are discussed. The findings suggest that being in-role as a scientist offered learners various opportunities to be agentive, to think and act scientifically, better appreciate the nature of work that scientists do and consequently appreciate the NoS. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","case study; inquiry-based learning; Nature of science",,,,,,,,,,,"Abd-El-Khalick, F., Examining the sources for our understandings about science: Enduring conflations and critical issues in research on nature of science in science education (2012) International Journal of Science Education, 34 (3), pp. 53-374; Abrahams, I., Braund, M., (2012) Performing science.

Given the need for an educated citizenry, it is important to explore if scientists–as learning facilitators–can use educational strategies to engage intergenerational groups. We view family learning from a sociocultural perspective where parent-child interactions and sensemaking practices are the focus of our analysis. We analyzed three water quality-themed workshops held at public libraries consisting of 25 hours of video data. With a focus on 17 participant family groups, we closely examined the influence of questions asked by three different scientists (each leading a workshop) to understand how the structure of these questions supported or did not support the families in sensemaking conversations. Our findings revealed a relationship between the types of questions the scientists asked and families’ talk related to the program content. Specifically, three questioning patterns emerged that either supported or hindered family connecting conversations: (1) family-focused question prompts, (2) scientist-focused question prompts (anti-questions), and (3) closed-ended question prompts. Our analysis illustrates that personally-relevant family learning about science in their community is supported by conversational opportunities for families to make connections between science and their shared experiences. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

Research on the experiences of children growing up in diverse families has shown that children may face disapproval, a lack of understanding, and in some cases, bullying by those outside of their home environment, including from their peers at school This study evaluated the use of theatrical performance and post-performance discussions as a method of informing young people about different families. Findings indicated that performance was an effective and engaging learning tool, as it presented first-hand experiences of family diversity. Post-performance discussions were important in enabling young people to improve their understanding of different methods of Assisted Reproductive Technologies and diverse family forms.

The current study explores scientific societies’ view of and support for public engagement. Interviews with key actors of 21 US-based scientific societies suggest that societies recognize the value of public engagement and outreach, and the emphasis has been steadily increasing. Depending on the membership size and discipline of the society, various types of engagement activities are supported and offered. We also explored potential challenges and opportunities for societies in supporting scientific engagement of the public. The current project aimed at providing an overview of the role of scientific societies to help identify ways to areas to enhance the allocation of resources to support public engagement and future research, including theory development. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","organizational support; public engagement; qualitative interview; science communication; Scientific society",,,,,,"Rita Allen Foundation, RAF","This work was supported by Rita Allen Foundation.

In order to reach a wide range of people with different science-art identities, levels of physics expertise, age, and gender, the Celebrating Einstein festival merges science, dance, and music. Festival components include: (1) a danced lecture with choreography inspired by representations of black holes and gravitational waves, and (2) live interviews with physicists that address issues of science, philosophy, religion, art, and education. We assessed the impact of this festival by deploying a pre- and post-event survey at three Celebrating Einstein festivals hosted in different sites in the United States (Northern, Southern, and Central), and by interviewing a subset of attendees at one location. This study focuses on participants’ knowledge gain, interest in science, and emotional reactions towards this science-art event. We explored how knowledge gain varies by participant demographics, how it correlates with an increased interest in science and intention to attend future science-art events, and how participants engaged emotionally. Results indicate that the science-art format effectively reached a wide range of demographic groups, significantly increased participants’ knowledge, interest in science and science-art events, and broadened their perception of scientists. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","general relativity; Science communication; STEAM",,,,,,,,,,,"Ainley, M., Ainley, J., Student engagement with science in early adolescence: The contribution of enjoyment to students’ continuing interest in learning about science (2011) Contemporary Educational Psychology, 36, pp. 4-12; Anderson, D., Lucas, K.B., Ginns, I.S., Theoretical perspectives on learning in an informal setting (2003) Journal of Research in Science Teaching, 40 (2), pp. 177-199; Babbie, E., (1992) The practice of social research, , New York: Macmillan; Barrett, L.F., Solving the emotion paradox: Categorization and the experience of emotion (2006) Personality and Social Psychology Review, 10, pp. 20-46; Bartko, W.T., The ABCs of engagement in out-of-school-time programs (2005) New Directions for Youth Development, 2005 (105), pp. 109-120; Bell, P., Lewentstein, B., Shouse, A.W., Feder, M.A., (2009) Learning science in informal environments: People, places, and pursuits, , Washington, DC: The National Academy Press, &, (Eds; Bultitude, K., McDonald, D., Custead, S., The rise and rise of science festivals: An international review of organised events to celebrate science (2011) International Journal of Science Education, Part B, 1 (2), pp. 165-188; Catterall, J.S., Involvement in the arts and success in secondary school (2002) Critical links: Learning in the arts and student achievement and social development, pp. 79-80. , Deasy R., (ed), Washington, DC: Arts Education Partnership,.

We conducted pre- and post-assessments on these questions for multiple years of the camp; some years had a song to go with those topics, and other years did not have a song. We found that for years when the song accompanied these concepts, campers showed an overall greater increase in knowledge of these topics than for years when there was not a song. The songs in this study were accompanied by simple movements that were designed to highlight the lyrics.

The main goal of the project was to investigate the potential impact of the GK-12 program on the ability of graduate students to communicate their scientific research and expertise to a non-technical audience comprised of high school chemistry, biotechnology, and environmental science students and teachers. The graduate student presentations about their research were videotaped before, during, and after their participation in the program. Applying a standardized communications rubric, analysis of the video presentations indicated significant improvement in the graduate students’ communication skills during their participation in the program. In addition, graduate student perception of their improvement in communication skills was demonstrated through a qualitative survey.

Over many years, a large number of projects funded across the United States placed graduate students in K-12 STEM classrooms. One GK-12 program evaluated by Stamp and O’Brien (2005) demonstrated that GK-12 graduate students perceived benefits included improved communication skills. Using personal interviews and written responses, Weeks and Harbor (2014) and Weeks, Gong, and Harbor (2015) conducted qualitative studies to assess the ways in which graduate students perceived the impact of the GK-12 program on their scientific communication skills and future careers.","This material is based on work supported by the National Science Foundation under Grant No. DGE-0638662.

This article instead explores the production of a set of science communication projects, arguing that actor-network theory (ANT) can be one possible tool for such research. The research focuses on a large science festival, 'Science in the City', which took place in Copenhagen in 2014. Four projects within the festival are analytically disassembled: by following their production, different actants involved in the projects are identified and attention given to the wider networks they are part of. A key finding is the diversity of actor-networks stabilised through the four science communication projects. These projects were framed as being not just ‘about’ effective communication of science, but as having other aims, including diverse personal, professional, or political endeavours. A key implication for scholarship is that, for those involved in the production of public communication, science communication is not an end in itself. The value of using ANT approaches for science communication research is also discussed. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Actor-network theory; event; production; science communication; science communication research; science festival",,,,,,"H2020 Marie SkÅodowska-Curie Actions, MSCA","This work was supported by a European Commission Marie Skłodowska-Curie grant; project title MAPES.",,,,"Baker-Doyle, K.J., Go ask Alice: Uncovering the role of a university partner in an informal science curriculum support network (2013) International Journal of Science Education, Part B, 3 (3), pp. 233-245; Bauer, M.W., The evolution of public understanding of science–discourse and comparative evidence (2009) Science Technology & Society, 14 (2), pp. 221-240; Bauer, M.W., Petkova, K., Boyadjieva, P., Gornev, G., Long-Term trends in the public representation of science across the ‘Iron Curtain’: 1946–1995 (2006) Social Studies of Science, 36 (1), pp. 99-131; Bennett, D.J., Jennings, R.C., (2011) Successful science communication: Telling it like it is, , Cambridge: Cambridge University Press; Brossard, D., Scheufele, D.A., Kim, E., Lewenstein, B.V., Religiosity as a perceptual filter: Examining processes of opinion formation about nanotechnology (2009) Public Understanding of Science, 18 (5), pp. 546-558; Bultitude, K., Science festivals: Do they succeed in reaching beyond the ‘already engaged’?

The 2864 participants in the study were adult hobbyists that included birders, astronomers, gardeners, model builders, insect collectors, rock/fossil collectors, home brewers, beekeepers, inventors, and environmental monitors. Participants completed a survey about their educational background, levels of hobby participation, motivation to participate in the hobby, perceived benefits of participating in the hobby, influences to continue to continue to engage in the hobby, reported influences on career choice influences, and perceived science identity. Results showed hobbyists with STEM careers were significantly more likely than those without STEM careers to rate elementary, middle, and high school experiences as well as college, museums and science centers, and clubs as influential on the development of the hobby. Those hobbyists with STEM careers were significantly more likely than those without a STEM career to report more ability in science, mathematics, and technology and to report that their choice of a career was influenced by factors such as enjoyment, encouragement from family, and hobby involvement. Conclusions suggest that engagement in a science hobby can provide support for youth to continue on to a STEM career as an adult. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Informal education; leisure; life long learning; STEM career",,,,,,"National Science Foundation, NSF: 1114500","This work was supported by National Science Foundation [1114500].",,,,"Archer, L., DeWitt, J., Osborne, J., Dillon, J., Willis, B., Wong, B., ‘Doing’ science versus ‘being’ a scientist: Examining 10/11-year-old schoolchildren’s construction of science through the lens of identity (2010) Science Education, 94 (4), pp. 617-639; Atkinson, R., Mayo, M., (2010), Refueling the US innovation economy: Fresh approaches to science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) education; Avery, L.M., Rural science education: Valuing local knowledge (2013) Theory Into Practice, 52 (1), pp. 28-35; Bandura, A., The explanatory and predictive scope of self-efficacy theory (1986) Journal of social and clinical psychology, 4 (3), pp. 359-373; Bandura, A., Perceived self-efficacy in cognitive development and functioning (1993) Educational Psychologist, 28 (2), pp. 117-148; Bandura, A., Schunk, D.H., Cultivating competence, self-efficacy, and intrinsic interest through proximal self-motivation (1981) Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 41 (3), p. 586; Bem, T.J., Self perception theory (1972) Advances in Educational Social Psychology, 6, pp. 1-62; Bong, M., Skaalvik, E.M., Academic self-concept and self-efficacy: How different are they really?

This study created such a ‘third space’ for science education, linking an informal university educator with schools to increase student choice in science lessons using the community of inquiry pedagogical model. Studying learning in free choice environments is challenging due to the range of possible outcomes. Participant observations, questionnaires and interviews involving 507 students aged 11–14 were carried out in 20 UK state schools. Data were analysed using Falk and Dierking’s Contextual Model of Learning which allowed consideration of the totality of students’ experiences whilst acknowledging the complexity of free(er) choice spaces. Findings indicate that this space allowed students to exercise choice and control over learning, and to connect science with their prior knowledge and interests. However, choice also acted as a barrier to learning where students lacked sufficient prior knowledge or were uncomfortable with content. The role of peers and facilitated discussion was important. This indicates that there are benefits to opening up spaces for free choice learning in school science using the community of inquiry model. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","dialogue; informal education; School/university interface; science outreach",,,,,,"Wellcome Trust, WT","This study was funded by a Society Award from the Wellcome Trust.",,,,"Archer, L., Dawson, E., DeWitt, J., Seakins, A., Wong, B., Science capital’: A conceptual, methodological, and empirical argument for extending Bourdieusian notions of capital beyond the arts (2015) Journal of Research in Science Teaching, 52 (7), pp. 922-948. , ‘; Bamberger, Y., Tal, T., Learning in a personal context: Levels of choice in a free choice learning environment in science and natural history museums (2007) Science Education, 91 (1), pp. 75-95; Bennett, J., Dunlop, L., Knox, K.J., Reiss, M.J., Torrance Jenkins, R., (2016) A rapid evidence review of practical independent research projects in science, , Wellcome Trust, London; Burden, R., Williams, M., (2001) Thinking through the curriculum, , London: Routledge; Burgh, G., Nichols, K., The parallels between philosophical inquiry and scientific inquiry: Implications for science education (2012) Educational Philosophy and Theory, 44 (10), pp. 1045-1059; (2007) The statutory curriculum at key stage 3 rationale and detail, , Belfast: CCEA; Falk, J., Free-choice environmental learning: Framing the discussion (2005) Environmental Education Research, 11 (3), pp. 265-280; Falk, J., Dierking, L., (2012) The museum experience revisited, , Walnut Creek: Routledge; Falk, J.H., Dierking, L.D., (2000) Learning from museums: Visitor experiences and the making of meaning, , Oxford: Altamira Press; Falk, J., Storksdieck, M., Using the contextual model of learning to understand visitor learning from a science center exhibition (2005) Science Education, 89 (5), pp. 744-778; Falk, J., Dierking, L.D., (2002) Lessons without limit: How free-choice learning is transforming education, , Oxford: AltaMira Press; Floridi, L., What is a philosophical question?

Despite the fragmented nature of the evidence on their effectiveness, science shows are commonly used in informal science learning, particularly in science centres, schools and museums. We have collated the literature into a comprehensive review of the history, typology and evidence base for science performance, drawing on a variety of literature including research discussing classroom demonstrations, science shows used in schools and museums, museum theatre and informal science learning. We found there is good qualitative and quantitative evidence to support the use of science shows both in informal science learning and as part of the school curriculum. Science shows that use demonstrations linked by a common theme have successfully produced both cognitive and affective outcomes, and theatrical science shows are frequently used to create awareness and stimulate discussion about complex and controversial science-related issues, such as HIV-AIDS and human cloning.

We analyzed the visits of four adolescents groups, from public schools, to Maloka (Bogotá, Colombia), and observed the relations of the visitors with their peers, with the exhibits, and with the explainers. For this objective, we examine video and audio recordings in terms of types of interaction and conversational content, seeking to answer: Is the explainer a necessary component of a visit to promote sustained cognitive engagement, or do non-guided activities also create enough interest to promote and sustain cognitive engagement? Active meaning-making was observed during the interactions with exhibits and explainers. In the latter case, the presence of the explainer appears to lead to refinement and complexification were in the sense making and activity of adolescents. In accordance with their sustained engagements and motivations, they mobilized knowledge and previous experiences in the relation with exhibits, in an engaged and autonomous manner, creating learning opportunities based on free-choice, which was reflected in their discussions about scientific themes or in the manual, mental and cultural interactions. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Adolescents; explainers; free-choice learning; science centres",,,,,,"440675/2015-4

We used a qualitative approach, analysing video recordings of museum visit and interviews with students, focusing on the way students use their former engagement in a science museum using a retrospective view that can offer insight into the pedagogy of the visit and exhibit design. The significance of this study lies in its retrospective lens that allowed us to understand how students build on earlier engagement with museum exhibits when they make repeat visits to informal learning environments. Our retrospective analysis of student learning from five exhibits suggests certain pedagogical and facilitation strategies in three specific areas: first, the sensory-motor experience promotes students’ understanding of the scientific principle of the exhibit. Second, exhibits should aim at presenting abstract concepts in a tangible way. Third, museum educators should use anchor-points throughout the visit to create a more cohesive ‘story’ for students, so that they relate to it in a way, which will help them remember the experience over time. Consequently, the main implications of this study concern exhibit design and the overall pedagogy of the visit. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","informal learning; Out-of-school education; retrospective analysis; school class visit; science museums",,,,,,"Israel Science Foundation, ISF: 562/15","This research was supported by the Israel Science Foundation, Research Grant Application no. 562/15",,,,"Achiam, M.F., A content-oriented model for science exhibit engineering (2013) International Journal of Science Education, Part B, 3 (3), pp. 214-232; Achiam, M., Simony, L., Lindow, B.E.K., Objects prompt authentic scientific activities among learners in a museum programme (2016) International Journal of Science Education, 38 (6), pp. 1012-1035; Afonso, A.S., Gilbert, J.K., The nature of exhibits about acoustics in science and technology centres (2008) Research in Science Education, 38 (5), pp. 633-651; Allen, S., Gutwill, J., Designing with multiple interactives: Five common pitfalls (2004) Curator: The Museum Journal, 47 (2), pp. 199-212; Anderson, D., Lucas, K.B., Ginns, I.S., Dierking, L.D., Development of knowledge about electricity and magnetism during a visit to a science museum and related post-visit activities (2000) Science Education, 84 (4), pp. 658-679; Andre, L., Durksen, T., Volman, M.L., Museums as avenues of learning for children: A decade of research (2017) Learning Environments Research, 20 (1), pp. 47-76; Archer, L., Dawson, E., DeWitt, J., Seakins, A., Wong, B., ‘Science capital': A conceptual, methodological, and empirical argument for extending bourdieusian notions of capital beyond the arts (2015) Journal of Research in Science Teaching, 52 (7), pp. 922-948; Ash, D., Dialogic Inquiry in life science Conversations of family groups in a museum (2003) Journal of Research in Science Teaching, 40 (2), pp. 138-162; Ash, D., Reflective scientific sense-making dialogue in two languages: The science in the dialogue and the dialogue in the science (2004) Science Education, 88 (6), pp. 855-884; Bamberger, Y., Tal, T., An experience for the Lifelong Journey: The long-term effect of a class visit to a science center (2008) Visitor Studies, 11 (2), pp. 198-121; Borun, M., (1983), Planets and Pulleys: Studies of Class Visits to Science Museums; Borun, M., Dritsas, J., Developing family-friendly exhibits (1997) Curator: The Museum Journal, 40 (3), pp. 178-196; Botelho, A., Morais, A.M., Students–exhibits interaction at a science center (2006) Journal of Research in Science Teaching, 43 (10), pp. 987-1018; Davidsson, E., Jakobsson, A., (2012) Understanding interactions at science centers and museums: Approaching sociocultural perspectives, , Rotterdam: SensePublishers; DeWitt, J., Archer, L., Mau, A., Dimensions of science capital: Exploring its potential for understanding students’ science participation (2016) International Journal of Science Education, 38 (16), pp. 2431-2449; Driver, R., (1985) Children's ideas in science, , UK: McGraw-Hill Education; Ellenbogen, K.M., Museums in family life: An ethnographic case study (2002) Learning conversations in museums, pp. 81-101. , Leinhardt G., Crowley G.K., Knutson K., (eds), Mahwah, NJ: Erlbaum,.

Using the lens of experiential learning theory, we examined the lasting impacts of science festivals on individual family members’ perspectives of the experience, and the similarities and differences in parent and children perspectives. The participants were 175 visitors and five families (7 children, 6 adults), who attended a science-themed festival. On the day of the event, 175 participants completed a questionnaire. Three months later individual family members participated in a drawing, drawing description, and interview. The results indicate that children described themselves as active participants, while parents portrayed themselves as onlookers. Families attended the event as a unit, but the experiences individuals described were dissimilar. The findings have implications for researchers and practitioners who design science festival programs. A discussion of seven characteristics of successful activities are included. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","active learning; child learning; experiential learning theory; families; Family learning; science festival",,,,,,,,,,,"Ainsworth, S., Prain, V., Tytler, R., Drawing to learn in science (2011) Science, 333 (6046), pp. 1096-1097; Allen, S., Looking for learning in visitor talk: A methodological exploration (2002) Learning conversations in museums, pp. 265-309. , Leinhardt G., Crowley K., Knutson K., (eds), New York, NY: Routledge,.

Citizen science provides lay audiences platforms for data collection and classification alongside access to large scientific databases. Although these platforms are intended for non-experts, they are often designed by scientists, who may not fully appreciate their importance. This may result in platforms that are incompatible with users’ needs and thus underused. This article describes the use of Human Computer Interactions (HCI) in a citizen science project for monitoring air-quality in the local environment. Using interviews, focus groups, questionnaires and log data from the project website (n = 138), in a three-phase iterative process, we identified public requirments from an online data presentation platform. The findings suggest participants were interested in real time, local, easy to understand information, which is practical, ready-to-use and presented in the context. These insights were implemented in the design of a new platform, constructed as a simple three-layer information display with representations of air-quality standards and practical recommendations. We examine participants’ use of the platform and discuss motivations and impediments to participation in the future design of citizen science projects for enhancing public engagement in science. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","air quality; citizen science; public engagement with science; User centered design",,,,,,"European Commission, EC: FP7-ENV-2012

However, many remain reluctant to participate in public engagement activities in part because they feel they lack relevant skills and experience. We surveyed scientists trained on engagement through a nationwide program called Portal to the Public and examined how participation in the program may have influenced their self-efficacy, commitment and attitudes about outreach, and perceived benefits from conducting outreach based on two-way exchange with lay audiences. Participating scientists who responded to the survey reported being deeply involved in and highly committed to hands-on interactive public outreach, felt their engagement skills had improved, and even viewed benefits of their engagement training that extended into university teaching and career development. Our findings suggest a comprehensive engagement training model, which incorporates learning theory, helps scientists build their own outreach strategies, provides opportunities to practice, and offers easy access to audiences, can have a sustained impact on disposition, perceived skills, and type of outreach conducted by scientists interested in deeper engagement with the public. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","comprehensive scientist training; impacts on scientists; Public engagement; science communication; science literacy; two-way exchanges",,,,,,"Institute of Museum and Library Services, IMLS

National Science Foundation, NSF: 1224129","For this study, we focused on one mature public engagement training model, Portal to the Public (PoP), because its validated framework centers on enhancing scientists’ two-way exchanges to support targeted learning outcomes and, as a national effort, involves a relatively large number of scientists (upwards of 750 by 2017). Led by Pacific Science Center (Seattle, Washington) and funded by the NSF and Institute of Museum and Library Services, the more than 10-year-old PoP program seeks to connect public audiences with the research and innovation that occurs in their own communities through activities and dialogue with local scientists. Originally focused on science centers, the PoP Network has expanded to include training of scientists through zoos, aquariums, botanical gardens, and university groups – currently, over 60 organizations across North America. PoP is founded on the premise that scientists should engage directly with audiences, often through interactive hands-on activities and using an understanding of how people learn and how to engage audiences in discovery-based learning (Selvakumar & Storksdieck, 2013). As a part of the professional development training, scientists are guided in identifying key messages and audience takeaways, and potential points of personal relevance for various public audiences. Most organizations using the PoP framework have scientists create activities that align with these messages and often take the form of a hands-on, tabletop manipulative based on their research. Example training activities include reflecting on each scientists’ ‘expert blind spot’ (i.e. forgetting what it is like to be a non-expert) and on the pleasure of discovery through exploration rather than simply being told; practicing strategies to spark initial conversations and support dialogue through effective questioning strategies; creating concept maps to consider various frames for conversations with public audiences; and developing and prototyping specific material elements for their dialogue-based outreach activity. Each participating organization adapts the PoP framework to fit its context and goals but common to all is the creation of opportunities for scientists to use their dialogue-rich activities during public events, and an explicit expectation that scientists engage with the public (i.e. this is an integral part of the training).","This material is based upon work by the National Science Foundation under [grant number #1224129].

This study examines how elementary-aged children individually or collaboratively engaged with festival exhibits at a public science festival in St. Petersburg, Florida. Although many exhibit activities are designed to appeal to children, no research has been done with regard to child engagement with one-day, outdoor science festivals, such as this one. Engagement can be measured by unobtrusive observation of the behavior and interactions of children. Factors that influenced child engagement in a free-choice learning environment included attention capacity and goals (e.g. engage with exhibits, explore the ambient environment, eat lunch), the ability to interact with peers and adults during their engagement, and the ability to make choices about engaging in collaborative activities or independent free play. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","27.762987; 27°45′46.8″N 82°38′11.3″W; assessment; children; engagement; families; informal learning; Public science events; −82.636473",,,,,,"National Science Foundation, NSF: 1423004","This study was generously funded through an EvalFest mini-methods grant.

Yet we know very little about how it affects the perception and appreciation of museum objects. In the present study, we examined children’s perceptions of real fossils and replicas. We explored four potential explanations underlying the appreciation of authentic objects: physical appearances, ideational motivations (i.e. authentic objects are simply ‘better’), associations and contagion (the belief that some quality or aspect of the object's history still inheres in the object). Seventy two children of 8–12 years old visiting a Dutch natural history museum were asked to rate the museum-worthiness of two replicas and two real dinosaur fossils in two states (whole object vs a small fragment). Results suggest that, although appearances and associations do play a role, the appreciation of real fossils is rooted in the contagious belief that previous contact of the object (e.g. with a living dinosaur) continues to act on the object after the physical contact has been severed. Altogether, our findings provide evidence that children look beyond superficial appearances and place great value on non-obvious features such as object history. © 2018, © 2018 The Author(s).

Science hobbyists embody this goal through their life-long leisure interests and engagement in science. This study compared the motivations, perceived hobby benefits, and factors that influenced their hobby development for citizen-scientists and non-citizen scientists. A deeper understanding of factors that relate to involvement in both citizen science and science hobbies may inform efforts to encourage such participation. Data were collected through open-ended interviews with 107 amateur astronomer and birder hobbyists (67 citizen scientists and 40 non-citizen science participants) and an online survey. The results of the interviews informed the development of the online survey that was distributed nationally; participants included 2119 non-citizen scientists and 745 citizen scientists. Citizen scientists reported different hobby-related motivations, interests, and experiences than non-citizen science hobbyists. Male citizen scientists were more likely than male non-citizen scientists to report sharing information with others and educating youth as important motives to their hobby participation. As compared to non citizen-scientists, citizen scientists reported being more influenced in their hobby by formal and informal educational institutions, were more likely than non-citizen scientist hobbyists to report publishing articles for the public and using electronic media to communicate with other hobbyists. Citizen scientists reported improved science process skills and a better understanding of the nature of science. The implications of the results for a deeper understanding of what encourages individuals to participate in citizen science and science hobbies are discussed. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","citizen science; Informal education; motivation; out of school learning",,,,,,"Division of Research on Learning in Formal and Informal Settings, DRL: 1114500","This work was supported by Division of Research on Learning in Formal and Informal Settings [grant number 1114500].",,,,"Avraamidou, L., Studying science teacher identity: Current insights and future research directions (2014) Studies in Science Education, 50 (2), pp. 145-179; Bar-Tal, D., Altruistic motivation to help: Definition, utility and operationalization (1986) Humboldt Journal of Social Relations, 13 (1-2), pp. 3-14; Bonney, R., Cooper, C.B., Dickinson, J., Kelling, S., Phillips, T., Rosenberg, K.V., Shirk, J., Citizen science: A developing tool for expanding science knowledge and scientific literacy (2009) BioScience, 59 (11), pp. 977-984; Bonney, R., Phillips, T.B., Ballard, H.L., Enck, J.W., Can citizen science enhance public understanding of science?

Using music could provide the dual benefits of (1) making STEM content more accessible and (2) enhancing students’ engagement in the learning process. Here we explore the extent to which music-oriented high school students achieve these two benefits when they participate in ‘Songwriting To Learn’, a possible variation on the Writing To Learn (WTL) model of instruction. We analysed 81 artist statements, collected over 12 years at an annual science fair, in which students described their music compositions and the compositions’ connections to science. Rather than simply reporting scientific facts in song lyrics, these students used an impressive variety of musical elements (Genre, Instruments, Lyrics, and Structure [i.e. chords, dynamics, melody, rhythm]) as metaphors or symbols for science-related elements (Scientific Topic, Conveying Information, Affect, Personal Story, Scientific Story). Many students demonstrated a sophisticated attention to musical details and nuances, consistent with their frequent self-identification as musicians and/or music fans. Moreover, in composing and performing songs, these students fulfilled some of the key criteria by which scientific identities are developed, including the forging of personal connections to science. By writing songs about science, students may use their practice-linked identities in the domain of music to express their growing understanding in the domain of science. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Arts integration; ArtSci; content-rich music; practice-linked identity",,,,,,,,,,,"Arnett, J.J., (1996) Metalheads: Heavy metal music and adolescent alienation; metal heads, , Boulder, CO: Westview Press; Balgopal, M.M., Wallace, A.M., Decisions and dilemmas: Using writing to learn activities to increase ecological literacy (2009) Journal of Environmental Education, 40 (3), pp. 13-26; Beans, C., Science and culture: Musicians join scientists to explore data through sound (2017) Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences U S A, 114 (18), pp. 4563-4565; Bennett, A., Subcultures or neo-tribes?

Our aim was to determine the extent to which textbooks from both countries contribute to students’ understanding of the STSE issues and therefore to students’ scientific literacy (SL), as well as to detect indicators of the Decontextualized and Socially Neutral View of Science and Technology (DSNVST), as a barrier for achieving that goal. We qualitatively and quantitatively inspected eight textbooks according to previously proposed criteria and sub-criteria: four Portuguese textbooks (two each for the 9th and 12th grade) and four German textbooks (two each for the 9th and the 11th grade). Based on compliance with our set of criteria and sub-criteria, we identified 2390 STSE statements attempting to approach STSE issues, but we also found important lacks in all textbooks and detected DSNVST indicators. Finally, we discuss possible linkages between these indicators and the socio-cultural background underlying textbooks, in terms of both educational policies determining curricula, and prevailing public attitudes towards science. Some similarities within each nationality, as well as some divergences between them endorse our hypothesis that the socio-cultural context from which textbooks emerged determined the choice of STSE content, the discussions employed, and the conception of science and technology displayed by the textbooks. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","environment; misconceptions; science; scientific literacy; society; socio-cultural context; STSE issues; technology; Textbook analysis",,,,,,,,,,,"Aikenhead, G., Renegotiating the culture of school science (2000) Improving science education: The contribution of research, pp. 245-264. , Millar R., Leach J., Osborne J., (eds), Buckingham, Philadelphia: Open University Press,.

We explored the question of whether the combination of a planetarium fieldtrip and classroom lessons could support young children's three-dimensional learning in astronomy. We assessed first grade students’ (6–7-year-olds; N = 46) three-dimensional learning at the intersection of lunar phenomena, representational practices, and patterns. Students’ were interviewed, where they both described their understanding verbally and constructed representations, before the intervention, after the intervention, and one year later. A mixed-methods analysis demonstrated significant improvement in students’ three-dimensional learning, focused on the apparent daily motion of the Moon and lunar phases. Analysis of both interview results and audio/video of the intervention suggest that the planetarium fieldtrip provided students with a source of evidence for concepts and patterns related to scientific phenomena, which was then the subject of further inquiry in the classroom as students integrated new science concepts and patterns with their own ideas for how to create scientific representations. These findings suggest that fieldtrips, when supported by students’ classroom experiences, can serve an important role in engaging young children in three-dimensional learning and thus pointing to ways that informal science venues can work with formal educators to engage students in doing science. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","astronomy; Elementary; fieldtrips; planetarium; science practices",,,,,,,"This work was partially funded by a Middle Atlantic Planetarium Society (MAPS) Education Research Grant.",,,,"Anderson, D., Lucas, K.B., The effectiveness of orienting students to the physical features of a science museum prior to visitation (1997) Research in Science Education, 27 (4), pp. 485-495; Anderson, D., Lucas, K.B., Ginns, I.S., Theoretical perspectives on learning in an informal setting (2003) Journal of Research in Science Teaching, 40 (2), pp. 177-199; Anderson, D., Lucas, K.B., Ginns, I.S., Dierking, L.D., Development of knowledge about electricity and magnetism during a visit to a science museum and related post-visit activities (2000) Science Education, 84 (5), pp. 658-679; Bamberger, Y., Tal, T., An experience for the lifelong journey: The long-term effect of a class visit to a science center (2008) Visitor Studies, 11 (2), pp. 198-212; Braun, V., Clarke, V., Using thematic analysis in psychology (2006) Qualitative research in psychology, 3 (2), pp. 77-101; Brazell, B.D., Espinoza, S., Meta-analysis of planetarium efficacy research (2009) Astronomy Education Review, 8 (1). , https://doi.org/10.3847/AER2009033; Brooks, M., Drawing, visualisation and young children’s exploration of “big ideas” (2009) International Journal of Science Education, 31 (3), pp. 319-341; Brown, J.S., Collins, A., Duguid, P., Situated cognition and the culture of learning (1989) Educational Researcher, 18 (1), pp. 32-42; Collins, A., Greeno, J.G., Situative view of learning (2011) Learning and cognition in education, pp. 64-68. , Aukrust V.G., (ed), Amsterdam: Elsevier, &,.

As geogames are played outdoors they offer various possibilities for environmental education. The geogame entitled FindeVielfalt Simulation is a location dependent game, developed in the BioDiv2Go project, which provides sensory experiences, discovering local biodiversity and increasing biodiversity-related knowledge and attitudes toward nature. The aim of this study is to examine the predictive potential of game-related enjoyment and of personal prerequisites (such as general ecological behaviour) on outcomes measuring acquisition of knowledge and attitude. Hierarchical regressions are used to investigate the dependencies of the constructs. The results demonstrate that an increase in biodiversity-related knowledge is neither predicted by previous attitudes nor by game-related enjoyment. Every player within the game was able to learn irrespective of personal prerequisites or game-enjoyment. However, the results also demonstrate that an increase in attitude toward nature is significantly influenced by game-related enjoyment and general ecological behaviour, with game-related enjoyment being the stronger predictor. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","attitudes toward nature; biodiversity knowledge; digital game-based learning; educational design research; environmental education; ESD; Game-related enjoyment; general ecological behaviour",,,,,,"Bundesministerium fÃ¼r Umwelt, Naturschutz, Bau und Reaktorsicherheit, BMUB

This issue is particularly problematic for novices who often believe that science in the media is factual and objective, even though an expected outcome of secondary education is to develop students’ abilities to critically evaluate information. By conducting cognitive Think Alouds and retrospective interviews with high school students, this study examined (1) their stances towards flawed claims in a Web media article about vaccination, (2) types of background knowledge used to make their assessments, and (3) responses when asked directly to critique the claims. Results of qualitative coding indicated that students who were most critical of the claims based their evaluation on knowledge of appropriate scientific reasoning and literacy skills. In contrast, students who accepted the claims relied on novice-level content knowledge, or a flawed understanding of scientific reasoning. Lastly, some students initially accepted the claims became critical in retrospect when explicitly asked to critique the article during the interview phase. Findings from this investigation suggest a need for more opportunities for students to critique science information, and a greater curricular emphasis on teaching evaluation skills and knowledge of valid scientific reasoning. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","critical reading; misinformation; questioning; science literacy; Web media",,,,,,"Stanford Graduate School of Education

In these interactive and sensory-rich environments, a well-designed programme can help participants to acquire knowledge and cultivate interest through experiential learning. Given the importance of informal activities in environmental education, it is crucial to identify which contextual components lead to successful learning outcomes. Thus far, research in environmental STEM education has focused on brief experiences, such as one-time visits to curated environments likeaquaria. Investigating the impact of multi-day/longer experiences in natural settings is critical because the level of engagement with the STEM topic and the interaction with the learning environment in such experiences have different cognitive and affective impacts. To address these current limitations, we explored whether there is evidence that a four-day, immersive outdoor soundscape ecology camp contributed to situational interest and conceptual understanding of middle-school youth. During the soundscape camp, a variety of evidence was collected through different instruments including drawing activities, questionnaires, an interview, and field-observations. Through a qualitative analysis and open coding, we identified three core principles of informal outdoor curricular design that positively contribute to participants’ learning experiences, including direct experience with nature, the use of authentic technology, and exercises that promote collaborative teamwork. We argue that activities that promote scientific practices and engagement with authentic tools in a real-world context creates a learning environment in which participants collaboratively construct deep conceptual understanding of different aspects of environmental STEM topics and foster interest in the context of science inquiry. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Conceptual understanding; environmental education; informal learning; situational interest; soundscape ecology",,,,,,"National Science Foundation, NSF: 1323615","This study is part of a doctoral research funded by the National Science Foundation’s Advancing Informal STEM Learning programme [NSF AISL grant number 1323615].",,,,"Ames, C., Competitive versus cooperative reward structures: The influence of individual and group performance factors on achievement attributions and affect (1981) American Educational Research Journal, 18 (3), pp. 273-287; Anderson, D., Kisiel, J., Storksdieck, M., Understanding teachers' perspectives on field trips: Discovering common ground in three countries (2006) Curator: The Museum Journal, 49 (3), pp. 365-386; Anderson, D., Lucas, K.B., Ginns, I.S., Dierking, L.D., Development of knowledge about electricity and magnetism during a visit to a science museum and related post-visit activities (2000) Science Education, 84 (5), pp. 658-679. , https://doi.org/10.1002/1098-237X(200009)84:5%26lt;658::AID-SCE6%26gt;3.0.CO;2-A, –,. doi; Anderson, J.R., Reder, L.M., Simon, H.A., Situated learning and education (1996) Educational Researcher, 25 (4), pp. 5-11; Angrosino, M.V., Recontextualizing observation: Ethnography, pedagogy, and the prospects for a progressive political agenda (2005) The sage handbook of qualitative research, 3, pp. 729-745. , Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage Publications; Archer, L., DeWitt, J., Osborne, J., Dillon, J., Willis, B., Wong, B., “Doing” science versus “being” a scientist: Examining 10/11-year-old schoolchildren‘s constructions of science through the lens of identity (2010) Science Education, 94 (4), pp. 617-639; Azevedo, F.S., Lines of practice: A practice-centered theory of interest relationships (2011) Cognition and Instruction, 29 (2), pp. 147-184; Bamberger, Y., Tal, T., Learning in a personal context: Levels of choice in a free choice learning environment in science and natural history museums (2007) Science Education, 91 (1), pp. 75-95; Barron, B., Interest and self-sustained learning as catalysts of development: A learning ecology perspective (2006) Human Development, 49 (4), pp. 193-224; Breunig, M., Murtell, J., Russell, C., Howard, R., The impact of integrated environmental studies programs: Are students motivated to act pro-environmentally?

The project offered different types of opportunity for scientific working, and involved four distinct groups of participants. Two distinguishing features of the different groups of participants were their primary motivation for engagement with the activity, and their level of previous engagement with formal STEM education. Participants in different parts of the project were assessed as to their level of science capital (Archer, L., Dawson, E., DeWitt, J., Seakins, A., & Wong, B. (2015). Science capital’: A conceptual, methodological, and empirical argument for extending bourdieusian notions of capital beyond the arts. Journal of Research in Science Teaching, 52, 922–948). Drawing upon engagement theory, the observable behaviours were used as an indicator of engagement and then categorised according to (Barriault, C., & Pearson, D. (2010). Assessing exhibits for learning in science centres: A practical tool. Visitor Studies, 13(1), 90–106) taxonomy. The analysis showed that learner engagement was exhibited at different levels by the different categories of participants, with higher levels of engagement exhibited by participants with a higher level of science capital. Although there was general correlation between the level of science capital and the proportion of higher engagement learning behaviours, one group of participants deviated from this trend. The findings indicate that the level of science capital is a key determinant of engagement and associated learning behaviours, but did not completely account for participants’ engagement in the science outreach activity. © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","engagement theory; learning behaviours; Outreach; science capital",,,,,,,,,,,"Archer, L., Dawson, E., DeWitt, J., Seakins, A., Wong, B., Science capital’: A conceptual, methodological, and empirical argument for extending Bourdieusian notions of capital beyond the arts (2015) Journal of Research in Science Teaching, 52, pp. 922-948; Archer, L., De Witt, J., Science aspirations, capital, and family habitus: How families shape children’s engagement and identification with science (2012) American Educational Research Journal, 49 (5), pp. 881-908; Archer, L., De Witt, J., Willis, B., Adolescent boys’ science aspirations: Masculinity, capital, and power (2014) Journal of Research in Science Teaching, 51 (1), pp. 1-30; Ateh, C.M., Charpentier, A., Sustaining student engagement in learning science (2014) The Clearing House: A Journal of Educational Strategies, Issues and Ideas, 87, pp. 259-263; Banks, M., (1995) Visual research methods., , http://sru.soc.surrey.ac.uk/SRU11/SRU11.html, Retrieved from; Barriault, C., The science center learning experience: A visitor-based framework (1999) The Informal Learning Review, 35 (1), pp. 14-16; Barriault, C., Pearson, D., Assessing exhibits for learning in science centres: A practical tool (2010) Visitor Studies, 13 (1), pp. 90-106; Berger, R., Rugen, L., Woodfin, L., (2014) Leaders of their own learning, , San Francisco: John Wiley and Sons; Bourdieu, P., Forms of capital (1986) Handbook of theory and research for sociology of education, pp. 241-258. , Richardson J.G., (ed), New York: Greenwood,.

This paper is set in the context of the recent introduction of science at primary level in Ireland and the existence of a great number of science outreach programmes, in particular from universities to support this sector. The recent movement to change science pedagogy in schools towards a focus on inquiry and constructivist methods commands discussion around pedagogical practice in both spaces (education and outreach). Building on the authors’ research which embraced a qualitative approach to ascertain participant perception of constructivism and understanding of conceptual and pedagogical dilemmas within science education, this paper reports a singularly quantitative insight, carried out in parallel, to facilitate a more formal and standardised comparison within and between populations and to allow generalisation to the larger population. A Constructivist Learning Environment (CLES) survey of both primary teachers (N = 148) and science outreach practitioners (N = 81) in Ireland was conducted, eliciting multiple dimension perceptions, in terms of pedagogical choice and comparative differentiators regarding sex, school size, outreach frequency in the classroom, role of outreach practitioner within their institution, outreach experience of the outreach practitioner. Results challenge beliefs presented in the literature about a deficit of science pedagogy amongst primary level teachers and therefore questions the role of science outreach in this relationship. This study provokes the necessity for a discussion of the third space, arising from the juxtaposition between science outreach and education. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","constructivist teaching and learning; primary education; Science outreach; third space",,,,,,"Instituto Nacional de CiÃªncia e Tecnologia para Excitotoxicidade e NeuroproteÃ§Ã£o, INCT-EN","This work was supported by Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia.",,,,"Agresti, A., (1996) An introduction to categorical data analysis, 135. , New York: Wiley; Aldridge, J.M., Fraser, B.J., Taylor, P.C., Chen, C., Constructivist learning environments in a cross-national study in Taiwan and Australia (2000) International Journal of Science Education, 22 (1), pp. 37-55; Appleton, K., Elementary science teaching (2007) Handbook of research on science education, pp. 493-535. , Abel S.K., Lederman N.G., (eds), Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum,.

Using content analysis, we studied a material consisting of 34 reports, written by 70 academic science teachers, as part of a teacher-training course on communication in science higher education. In the course, the teachers developed and implemented communication tasks into their content courses, and analysed and reported on the observed learning outcomes. The tasks covered both written and oral communication addressing different audiences, inside as well as outside of academia. We found that integrating different ways of communication training in science courses entailed improved skills in sharing and discussing science information, and in addition, increased subject understanding. Thus, we conclude that the integration of communication training may effectively support students’ science learning in higher education. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","higher education; Learning outcomes; learning through writing",,,,,,,,,,,"Baram-Tsabari, A., Lewenstein, B.V., Science communication training: What are we trying to teach?

Situated approaches such as research apprenticeships offer the chance to engage learners fully in science communities of practice and thus connect girls to science. However, such programs are often designed with lab settings, rather than field settings, in mind. This paper investigates a research apprenticeship program (Girls on Ice) that immerses girls in field science. In particular, the program makes explicit tacit elements needed for success in field science, such as a sense of adventure and physical and mental toughness. Using a qualitative approach, we explored how and in what ways girls connected to a field science community of practice. Emergent themes from the analysis illustrate that girls learned both explicit and tacit practices and ways of being that are associated with being a field scientist, such as team-oriented leadership and physical and mental perseverance. The results suggest that providing girls exposure to and practice with the tacit skills needed in science might constitute a new way to increase its perceived relevance and to counter gendered expectations of women in science. © 2018 The Author(s).

We imagine if any research faculty get support in public engagement with science it should be Extension faculty with appointments requiring them to interact with stakeholder audiences. Therefore, in a case study, we examine the experiences of exemplary Extension faculty members as nominated by their department chairs using semi-structured interviews and thematic coding. All ten participants in our study equated their extension work with scientific outreach. We found that while researchers note a lack of time and money for engagement, other barriers such as lack of mentoring and professional development in engagement techniques and evaluation as well as structural barriers in the Extension system may be more significant. Continued research on Extension faculty and other exemplary public engagement faculty members throughout the U.S. in similar and other disciplines will shed light on the extent of these problems. Professional development for scientists can assist all faculty members in increasing the impact of their work. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Extension education; professional development for scientists; Public engagement with science; scientific outreach",,,,,,"University of Florida, UF

This is despite the fact that little is known about the relationship between STEM competition participation and career interest in STEM. Through logistic regressions, this study addresses three main research questions: Controlling for student background variables and prior STEM career interest, does participating in a STEM competition increase the likelihood of STEM career interest at the end of high school? Does the field of competition (robotics, engineering, science fair, information technology) a student participates in influence the sub-discipline of STEM career interest? And, what is the relationship between the number of competitions participated in and the probability of interest in a STEM career? The study uses data from the ‘Outreach Programs and Science Career Intentions’ survey (N = 15,847), a large-scale sample of university students enrolled in mandatory English courses. Our data reveal three results of interest. First, students who participate in STEM competitions are more likely to express interest in a STEM-related career at the end of high school than are students who do not participate, even when students’ prior career interest in STEM is controlled for. Second, the relationship between competition participation and interest in a STEM career appears to be domain specific. Third, the impact of competition participation on pursuit of a STEM career is three times stronger when students compete in more than one competition. These findings suggest that competitions are an effective way to foster career interest in specific STEM careers. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Science fairs; science outreach; secondary/high school",,,,,,"National Science Foundation, NSF

National Science Foundation, NSF: 1161052","The population for this study is freshman students at American institutions of higher learning (both four-year and two-year institutions) who, in the fall semester for 2013, participated in the Outreach Programs and Science Career Intentions (OPSCI) survey of students in introductory college classes, funded by the National Science Foundation. The survey was administered mostly to freshman English classes that were required by the institution. This way, we were able to target a student population with a wide range of career interests (both in and outside of STEM). To solicit involvement in the study, recruitment emails were sent to English Department Chairs at 150 institutions across the United States. 104 of the 150 institutions did not respond. Out of the 46 institutions that did respond, 27 (59%) participated with at least one instructor. 414 of the 535 instructors who initially agreed to participate in the study, followed through and returned 15,847 completed student surveys. The students completed the surveys in class, on paper, and therefore there was 100% student participation.","This work was supported by the National Science Foundation [grant number 1161052].

To date, research into STEM hobbies and hobbyists has examined hobby groups by subject area. Missing from this body of work is research that examines the development and participation in different types of hobbies by age, ethnicity, and gender of participants. This research, part of a larger series of investigations of American adult STEM hobbyists, aims to fill that gap. Surveys were completed by 2,838 respondents from ten different STEM hobbies (astronomy, beekeeping, birding, electronics/robotics, environmental monitoring, falconry, gardening/horticulture, home brewing, model building, rock/fossil collecting). Results showed that there is great variation between STEM hobby groups across multiple variables and divergent descriptive profiles emerged for each group. Results also showed that, in several groups, more than half of the adult hobbyists reported first participating in their hobby during their youth. This study illustrates how crucial childhood experiences are to encouraging lifelong explorations in STEM and provides information about the types of experiences hobbyists reported as being influential to their hobby-related learning and development. This information may be used by educators and organizations to design programs to support current and future hobbyists. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","free-choice learning; hobby; Informal education; public engagement; survey",,,,,,"National Science Foundation, NSF: ISE 1114500","This work was supported by the National Science Foundation [grant number ISE 1114500].",,,,"Azevedo, F., Serious play: A comparative study of learning and engagement in hobby practices (2005) Unpublished PhD dissertation, , UC Berkeley, Berkeley, CA; Azevedo, F., Lines of practice: A practice-centered theory of interest relationships (2011) Cognition and Instruction, 29 (2), pp. 147-184; Azevedo, F., Knowing the stability of model rockets: A study of learning in interest-based practices (2013) Cognition and Instruction, 31 (3), pp. 345-374; Azevedo, F., The tailored practice of hobbies and its implication for the design of interest-driven learning environments (2013) Journal of the Learning Sciences, 22 (3), pp. 462-510; Bell, P., Lewenstein, B., Shouse, A., Feder, M., (2009) Learning science in informal environments: People, places, and pursuits, , Committee on Learning Science in Informal Environments, Washington, DC: The National Academies Press; Berendsen, M.L., Conceptual astronomy knowledge among amateur astronomers (2005) Astronomy Education Review, 4 (1), pp. 1-18; Carlone, H.B., Johnson, A., Understanding the science experiences of successful women of color: Science identity as an analytic lens (2007) Journal of Research in Science Teaching, 44 (8), pp. 1187-1218; Carver, E., (2013) Birding in the United States: A demographic and economic analysis; addendum to the 2011 National survey of fishing, hunting, and wildlife-associated recreation, , (Report 2011-1).

This qualitative study sought to better understand the roles family members play during the hike, the elements of the trail which they mention, the cognitive level of their questions, and the levels at which the conversations occurred. We followed nine (N = 9) families on hikes at the Houston Arboretum and collected with audio recordings, observations, and a researcher journal. Key findings include that questions asked on the nature trail tended to be low level while discourse overall showed higher levels of rigor. During their hikes, family members took on the roles of Explorer, Protector, and Rememberer. Moreover, features that family members saw became ‘sticky’ features, meaning they were mentioned later in the hike even when the object was not present. The results of this research have important implications for the way informal educators think about the importance of the interactions among family groups. Parents and children interact on nature trails in ways that lead to a greater understanding and appreciation of the natural world. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","arboretum; botanical garden; family learning; Family science; informal education",,,,,,,,,,,"Allen, S., Looking for learning in visitor talk: A methodological exploration (2002) Learning conversations in museums, pp. 259-303. , Leinhardt G., Crowley K., Knutson K., (eds), Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates,.

The intention is, thus, to explore how popular science writing can help students discover and discuss different perspectives on science matter. For this purpose, texts written by 12 bachelor students in biology were analysed in a case study. For each of the students, four texts were studied using content analysis: two versions of a popular science article on the student's bachelor project, and two texts reflecting on why the project is interesting. Throughout the writing process an increased number of perspectives was observed; the character of the perspectives also changed, from a narrow research perspective to a wider societal perspective. For example, environmental, medical, economical or ethical perspectives were added during the writing process. There was also a change concerning the level on which science matter was discussed, from specific to more general. A second aim was to explore how popular science writing may facilitate students’ scientific writing. In this part of the study, content analysis was conducted on 23 students’ written reflections. A vast majority described how the popular writing facilitated, in particular, the choice of content and perspectives also in their scientific writing. Altogether, the study concludes that popular science writing offers a cognitive tool to widen science students’ perspectives, and hence, to promote their development of scientific literacy and achievement of scientific writing skills. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","higher education; learning through writing; Popularising science; scientific literacy",,,,,,,,,,,"Armstrong, N.A., Wallace, C.S., Chang, S.M., Learning from writing in college biology (2008) Research in Science Education, 38, pp. 483-499; Bargh, J.A., Schul, Y., On the cognitive benefits of teaching (1980) Journal of Educational Psychology, 72 (5), pp. 593-604; Cohen, L., Manion, L., Morrison, K., (2007) Research methods in education, , London: Routledge Falmer; Dysthe, O., Hertzberg, F., Hoel, T.L., (2011) Skriva för att lära, , [Writing to learn], Lund: Studentlitteratur; Gerdeman, R.D., Russell, A.A., Worden, K.J., Web-based student writing and reviewing in a large biology lecture course (2007) Journal of College Science Teaching, 36 (5), pp. 46-52; Hammer, D., Elby, A., Tapping epistemological resources for learning physics (2003) Journal of the Learning Sciences, 12 (1), pp. 53-90; Hand, B., Gunel, M., Ulu, C., Sequencing embedded multimodal representations in a writing to learn approach to the teaching of electricity (2009) Journal of Research in Science Teaching, 46 (3), pp. 225-247; Hand, B., Prain, V., Teachers implementing writing-to-learn strategies in junior secondary science: A case study (2002) Science Education, 86 (6), pp. 737-755; Jeppsson, F., Begreppsliga metaforer i studenters dialog (2013) Modeller, analogier och metaforer i naturvetenskapsundervisning, pp. 155-166. , Jeppsson F., Haglund J., (eds), Lund: Studentlitteratur,.

Science festivals have rapidly expanded in recent years as an outgrowth of these values, aiming to engage and educate the public about scientific topics and research. While resources invested in public engagement by scientists, universities, and governments are admirable in principle; this study indicates that their ambition to broaden the reach of science may be going unrealized in practice. Using data from three major UK science festivals, we demonstrate such events are disproportionately reaching economically privileged and educated audiences already invested in science, as opposed to diverse and broadly representative samples of the general public. Our results demonstrate that these science festivals are falling short of their aims to make science accessible to a broad audience. There is a clear need for improved practices and on-going evaluation to ensure science festivals include those who are not already scientifically converted. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Evaluation study; informal education; museum studies; science communication; science festival",,,,,,,,,,,"(2009) A history of the British science association, , http://www.britishscienceassociation.org/web/AboutUs/OurHistory/index.htm, Retrieved June 28, 2009, from; Buckley, N., Hordijenko, S., Science festivals (2011) Successful Science Communication: Telling it Like it is, pp. 240-255. , https://books.google.ca/books/about/Successful_Science_Communication.html?id=cw98Z78rjZIC&redir_esc=y, Bennett D.J., Jennnings R.C., (eds), Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, Retrieved from:, &,.

Among 273 Singapore Internet users who participated in an online survey, most reported using YouTube during the previous week, and one-third reported using it to watch science videos. Hierarchical regression analysis explained 55% of the variance in their intention to seek science videos during the subsequent week. Significant predictors of interest were seeking-related subjective norm, enjoyment of science, and informational use of YouTube.

The first orientation, enjoyment of science, was positively related to seeking intention. This finding suggests that individuals who seek science videos on YouTube have positive feelings toward science and are intrinsically motivated to engage with it. As a similar orientation underlies free-choice science learning (Chittenden et al., 2004; Falk & Dierking, 2002), this finding corroborates the assertion that science video seeking on YouTube is a kind of free-choice science learning. Whereas science educators in formal learning environments may use You-Tube as an instructional tool (e.g. Jung & Lee, 2015), additional value arises when individuals use YouTube to learn about science on their own time. There are currently a range of funding opportunities for informal science learning in more traditional venues, such as science museums and television programing (e.g. U.S. National Science Foundation, n.d.). Given the accessibility of YouTube, relevant funding agencies should support science-related YouTube channels to help bring science content to a potentially large audience of individuals who enjoy science.","This research was supported by a grant from the Wee Kim Wee School of Communication and Information at Nanyang Technological University.",,,"AbiGhannam, N., Kahlor, L., Dudo, A., Liang, M.-C., Rosenthal, S., Banner, J.L., Expectancies and motivations to attend an informal science lecture series (2015) International Journal of Science Education, Particle B, 6, pp. 215-238; Ajzen, I., The theory of planned behavior (1991) Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes, 50 (2), pp. 179-211; Ajzen, I., Nature and operation of attitudes (2001) Annual Review of Psychology, 52, pp. 27-58; Ajzen, I., (2006) Constructing a TPB questionnaire: Conceptual and methodological considerations, , http://people.umass.edu/aizen/pdf/tpb.measurement.pdf, Retrieved from; Ajzen, I., Driver, B.L., Application of the theory of planned behavior to leisure choice (1992) Journal of Leisure Research, 24 (3), pp. 207-224; Armitage, C.J., Conner, M., Efficacy of the theory of planned behaviour: A meta-analytic review (2001) British Journal of Social Psychology, 40, pp. 471-499; Barry, D.S., Marzouk, F., Chulak-Oglu, K., Bennett, D., Tierney, P., O'Keeffe, G.W., Anatomy education for the YouTube generation (2016) Anatomical Sciences Education, 9 (1), pp. 90-96; Bond, R., Smith, P.B., Culture and conformity: A meta-analysis of studies using Asch’s (1952b, 1956) line judgment task (1996) Psychological Bulletin, 119 (1), pp. 111-137; Bondad-Brown, B.A., Rice, R.E., Pearce, K.E., Influences on TV viewing and online user-shared video use: Demographics, generations, contextual age, media use, motivations, and audience activity (2012) Journal of Broadcasting & Electronic Media, 56 (4), pp. 471-493; (2014) The state of broadband 2014: Broadband for all, , http://www.broadbandcommission.org/documents/reports/bb-annualreport2014.pdf, Retrieved from Geneva; Burns, M., Medvecky, F., The disengaged in science communication: How not to count audiences and publics (2016) Public Understanding of Science; Chao, Y.L., Lam, S.P., Measuring responsible environmental behavior: Self-reported and other-reported measures and their differences in testing a behavioral model (2011) Environment and Behavior, 43 (1), pp. 53-71; Chittenden, D., Farmelo, G., Lewenstein, B.V., (2004) Creating connections: Museums and the public understanding of current research, , Walnut Creek, CA: AltaMira Press; Cho, J., Shah, D.V., McLeod, J.M., McLeod, D.M., Scholl, R.M., Gotlieb, M.R., Campaigns, reflection, and deliberation: Advancing an O-S-R-O-R model of communication effects (2009) Communication Theory, 19 (1), p. 66; Cialdini, R.B., Kallgren, C.A., Reno, R.R., A focus theory of normative conduct: A theoretical refinement and reevaluation of the role of norms in human-behavior (1991) Advances in Experimental Social Psychology, 24, pp. 201-234; Cooke, L., A visual convergence of print, television, and the internet: Charting 40 years of design change in news presentation (2005) New Media & Society, 7 (1), pp. 22-46; Dudo, A., Scientists, the media, and the public communication of science (2015) Sociology Compass, 9 (9), pp. 761-775; Earnheardt, M.B., Motivating the U.S. Voter: The functions of elaboration and political motives when using TV and the internet (2013) Atlantic Journal of Communication, 21 (1), pp. 65-94; Ellingsen, S., Seismic shifts: Platforms, content creators and spreadable media (2014) Media International Australia, 150, pp. 106-113; Falk, J.H., Dierking, L.D., (2002) Lessons without limit: How free-choice learning is transforming education, , Walnut Creek, CA: AltaMira Press; Falk, J.H., Dierking, L.D., Swanger, L.P., Staus, N., Back, M., Barriault, C., Verheyden, P., Correlating science center use with adult science literacy: An international, cross-institutional study (2016) Science Education, 100 (5), pp. 849-876; Falk, J.H., Needham, M.D., Factors contributing to adult knowledge of science and technology (2013) Journal of Research in Science Teaching, 50 (4), pp. 431-452; Falk, J.H., Storksdieck, M., Dierking, L.D., Investigating public science interest and understanding: Evidence for the importance of free-choice learning (2007) Public Understanding of Science, 16 (4), pp. 455-469; Feinstein, N., Salvaging science literacy (2011) Science Education, 95 (1), pp. 168-185; Fishbein, M., Ajzen, I., (1975) Belief, attitude, intention, and behavior: An introduction to theory and research, , Reading, MA: Addison-Wesley; Go, E., You, K.H., Jung, E., Shim, H., Why do we use different types of websites and assign them different levels of credibility?

Self-efficacy for science communication distinguishes scientists who engage with the public and relates to scientists’ attitudes about the public. As such, self-efficacy for public engagement has the potential to serve as a key indicator in the evaluation of scientist training and public outreach programs. To date, most evaluation scales have been designed for public audiences, rather than scientists. This study used think-aloud methods and Item Response Theory to develop a scale to measure scientists’ Self-Efficacy for Public Engagement with Science. The results from this study support the use of a 13-item self-efficacy scale, and provide initial validation evidence to support its use with scientists who engage with the public. The findings are presented in relation to the continued study of public engagement through both research and evaluation. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Public engagement; Rasch process; science communication",,,,,,,,,,,"Ahteensuu, M., Assumptions of the deficit model type of thinking: Ignorance, attitudes, and science communication in the debate on genetic engineering in agriculture (2012) Journal of Agricultural and Environmental Ethics, 25, pp. 295-313; Alda center info, , http://www.aldakavlilearningcenter.org/get-started/about-us, Retrieved from; Allum, N.C., Sturgis, P., Tabourazi, D., Brunton-Smith, I., Science knowledge and attitudes across cultures: A meta-analysis (2008) Public Understanding of Science, 17 (1), pp. 35-54; (2016) Theory of change for public engagement with science, , https://www.aaas.org/page/theory-change-public-engagement-science, Retrieved from; Leshner leadership institute for public engagement with science, , https://www.aaas.org/pes/leshner-leadership-institute, Retrieved from; (2014) Standards for educational and psychological testing, , Washington, DC: American Educational Research Association; An, X., Yung, Y., (2014) Item response theory: What it is and how you can use the IRT procedure to apply it, , https://support.sas.com/resources/papers/proceedings14/SAS364-2014.pdf, [White paper].

Also, although trainers generally recognize the value of two-way communication, it is seldom addressed in science communication trainings.

However, concerns remain around issues of equity and access. The Enterprising Science study builds upon previous research in this area and uses the construct of ‘science capital’ to understand and support science engagement among young people, particularly those historically marginalised from science. Drawing on survey data from nearly 6000 children ages 11–16 in England, we investigate who participates in particular areas of informal STEM learning outside of the science classroom. Survey findings are illustrated by interview data from the same project. Analyses suggest that overall participation in different types of informal science learning experiences (‘informal’ learning experiences, ‘everyday’ learning experiences, and school-led enrichment) varies. Generally, students from more privileged social backgrounds participate more, but with further ethnic and gender patterns between different ISL activity types. These differential patterns of participation highlight how some areas of the ecosystem (e.g. ‘everyday’ learning experiences) are more accessible, while others (e.g. in designed spaces and school-led enrichment) could do more to address inequities in participation. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","equity; learning outside the classroom; participation; Science learning ecosystem",,,,,,"National Science Foundation

The SAQ of possum (Trichosurus vulpecula) control using aerial dispersal of 1080 (sodium fluoroacetate) was the context in which the participants (actants), their performative actions and affiliations (nodes) were mapped. Actants were identified via a Google search for groups’ websites with an opinion about 1080. Twenty-three groups were identified and their webpages analysed in terms how they perceived the issue. The construction of a cartography from these data showed the complexity of the group interactions. An analysis of justifications illustrated the range of stabilising mechanisms used. This research demonstrates the educational potential of ANT to develop a pedagogy that enables students to explore an SAQ and appreciate the multiplicity of perspectives. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","actor-network theory; Science communication; socially acute questions",,,,,,"CASSIS612227","This work was supported by the International Research Staff Exchange Scheme: [grant number CASSIS612227].",,,,"Ashley, M., Science: An unreliable friend to environmental education?

International surveys such as Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) and the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) emphasize the importance of scientific literacy. Scientific literacy is now regarded as a significant learning goal in science education. TIMSS assesses the mastery of scientific knowledge and method, while PISA focuses on the use of scientific knowledge and methods in measuring scientific literacy. On the other hand, adults’ scientific literacy has been measured mainly from the perspective of mastery of scientific knowledge and skills, although a great deal of the research in this area highlights the importance of use of scientific knowledge and skills, and decision-making in an authentic context. It is considered necessary to propose a new tool that can assess unmeasured aspects of the scientific literacy of adults as described above, particularly focusing on civic scientific literacy required for citizens in democratic society. In this paper, the author describes the development of the Assessment of Civic Scientific Literacy (ACSEL). A total of 401 Japanese general citizens aged over 20 years old participated in this study via an Internet Research System. First of all, the reliability and validity of ACSEL are examined in order to confirm whether it can be practically used or not. Secondly, the author reports the responses for each item. Finally, the individual contributions of gender, age, and educational background on civic scientific literacy scores are investigated to identify determinants. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","adult; age; authentic assessment; educational background; gender; rubric; Scientific literacy",,,,,,"Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology","The author would like to acknowledge the financial support of the programme for leading graduate schools (all-round model) from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan for funding this research.",,,,"Amelink, C., (2009) SWE-AWE CASEE Overviews, , Literature overview: Gender differences in science achievement; (1989) Science for all Americans, , Washington, DC: AAAS; Blanco-López, Á., España-Ramos, E., González-García, F.J., Franco-Mariscal, A.J., Key aspects of scientific competence for citizenship: A Delphi study of the expert community in Spain (2015) Journal of Research in Science Teaching, 52 (2), pp. 164-198; Bybee, R.W., (1997) Achieving scientific literacy: From purpose to practices, , Portsmouth, NH: Heinemann; Chang, S., Chiu, M., The development of authentic assessments to investigate ninth graders?

It was first held in 2005 and now takes place in up to 300 locations across Europe with the aim of bringing researchers closer to the general public. European Researchers’ Night has benefited from more than €40 million in funding from the European Commission over the last decade. With the prospect of further funding being made available in the coming years it is important to determine if that investment is justified. In Ireland, European Researchers’ Night is the only event of its kind that collectively opens the doors of laboratories and research centres so that the public and media can spend an evening engaging with researchers and their work.

The 2013 event was funded by the Seventh Frame-work Programme for Research and Technological Development (Call: FP7-PEOPLE-2013-NIGHT). The 2014 and 2015 events were funded by Ireland’s first successful Horizon 2020 award (Call: H2020-MSCA-NIGHT-2014). This paper focuses on the 2015 event which was organised by Trinity College Dublin and the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, with the night itself taking place on the 25th of September on the campus of Trinity College in Dublin’s city centre. From 4 pm until 10 pm most of the campus became accessible to visitors. Laboratories and workspaces that were usually exclusively occupied by researchers were open to people taking part in tours, workshops, discussions and demonstrations. In total, more than 70 separate events were held across the campus in diverse research areas such as robotics, linguistics, theatre, biotechnology, history and gender studies. A large media campaign on national television and radio, in tandem with a social media campaign in the weeks leading up to the night, as well as celebrity endorsements (Figure 1), resulted in approximately 5,000 visitors to the campus over the course of the evening.","European Researchers’ Night in Ireland in 2015 was funded by the European Commission’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme through its coordination and support action: H2020-MSCA-NIGHT-2014 (Grant agreement no. 633292).

The 146 participants were 11- to 13-year-old Finnish pupils visiting a science centre exhibition. The data, which consisted of both cognitive tasks and self-report questionnaires, were collected using a pre- post-test design and were analysed by SEM path-analysis. The results showed that AR-technology experience was beneficial for all, but especially for the lowest-achieving group and for the girls. In general, pre-knowledge skills predicted post-knowledge test results. As expected, school achievement had an effect on pre-knowledge results. In addition, motivation turned out to be an alternative key route for learning. Being a boy predicted directly or indirectly all other motivational variables, enjoyment and interest, but girls had a higher relative autonomy experience (RAI). Situation motivation and attitude towards learning in the science exhibition were much more strongly inter-connected among boys than girls, and attitude predicted post-knowledge only for boys. AR seems to be a promising method by which to learn abstract phenomena using a concrete manner. © 2016 The Author(s).

They have represented so-called ‘edutainment’ for some people. Learning from informal sources and in- an out-of-school environment can be effective and motivating. In this study, 12-year-old pupils (N = 366) visited a dinosaur science centre exhibition in Finland. Pupils were tested with standardised tests of motivation as defined by self-determination theory, cognitive skills, and interest via pre-, post-, and delayed post-tests during a six-month period. Findings show that pupils learned from the science centre visit and enjoyed the experience. The factors explaining their post-test knowledge in addition to their previous knowledge were (1) general cognitive competence, (2) liking studying biology at the science centre, (3) participation in a dinosaur demonstration, and (4) gender. As there was no difference between boys and girls in general cognitive competences, the knowledge results of boys and girls equally related to their cognitive competence. Autonomy also influenced situational motivation both directly and indirectly, which in turn had a strong effect on liking studying in the exhibition. It also influenced the post-test knowledge indirectly. In the lowest school achievement group, participation in the dinosaur demonstration increased knowledge in the post-test. © 2016 The Author(s).

We therefore aimed at understanding how outdoor educators (OEs) refer to, and use, the natural environment while guiding field trips, and how their use of the natural environment affects student learning outcomes. Using a mixed-method design, we studied 20 field trips to natural environments with respect to the content the OEs communicated to their students, the skills they taught, and the methods they used. The data we collected included observations of the 20 field trips, interviews with the OEs and their students, and 569 students’ questionnaires. We found that the OEs often refer to scientific phenomena and concepts that can be seen outdoors, but they rarely attempt to develop values and attitudes. Eight types of learning outcomes were identified, of which structured active learning stood out as a practice that contributed to a variety of outcomes. Environmental action contributed to shaping students’ attitudes and environmental behavior intentions. The thorough analysis we offer of the use of the natural environment could guide OEs pedagogy and, particularly, their use of the natural environment and could lead to further research in this field. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","field trip; informal learning; learning outcomes; Natural environment; outdoor educator",,,,,,"Israel Science Foundation, ISF: 1244/10","This work was supported by Israel Science Foundation under [grant Number 1244/10].",,,,"Afonso, A.S., Gilbert, J.K., Educational value of different types of exhibits in an interactive science and technology center (2007) Science Education, 91 (6), pp. 967-987; Allen, S., Designs for learning: Studying science museums exhibits that do more than entertain (2004) Science Education, 88 (1), pp. S17-S33; Ballantyne, R., Packer, J., Nature-based excursions: School students’ perceptions of learning in natural environments (2002) International Research in Geographical and Environmental Education, 11 (3), pp. 218-236; Ballantyne, R., Packer, J., Promoting environmentally sustainable attitudes and behaviour through free choice learning experiences: What is the state of the game?

It is generally assumed that understandings of nature of science (NOS) will lead to this desired outcome of scientific literacy. This study examined the criteria applied and the capacity in which they were applied by non-science majors in evaluating science news. Sixty-four non-science majors from a local community college completed the Health News Evaluation Questionnaire and were invited for follow-up interviews. Findings showed that participants tended to focus more on the cognitive aspects of science than on the social or epistemological aspect of science in their evaluation, and that news reports of a socioscientific nature tended to elicit more responses pertaining to the social aspect of science than did reports of scientific research. These findings indicated the capacity of the non-science majors to draw upon the cognitive aspects of science despite their limited science background. This study laid the foundation for future research to explore further the assumed role of understandings of NOS in the critical evaluation of news reports with a science component. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Nature of science; news media; scientific literacy",,,,,,"National Research Council

Our results indicated that the secondary students (aged 15–18 years) had pre-existing knowledge of the local delta area that included both abiotic and biotic factors. Prior to the field trip students drew generic and isolated configurations of land and water features. The change in scores from pre- to post-visit drawings indicated that the experiential field trip did cause an overall statistically significant change in students’ knowledge of the local delta environment. Our findings denote the importance of outdoor field experiences and calls attention to the need for collaboration between informal and formal educators. Based on the findings of this study, an experiential learning approach could provide an effective model for informal program design and formal classroom activities related to field experiences. The researchers make suggestions for formal and informal educators that reflect the findings and relate to the experiential learning cycle. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Drawings; environmental education; experiential learning theory; field trips; outdoor education",,,,,,,,,,,"Alerby, E., A way of visualizing children’s and young people’s thoughts about the environment: A study of drawings (2000) Environmental Education Research, 6 (3), pp. 205-222; Ausubel, D.P., (1968) Educational psychology: A cognitive view, , New York, NY: Holt, Rinehart & Winston; Bamberger, Y., Tal, T., (2006) What do students learn on class visits to natural history museums, , Paper presented at the meeting of the National Association for Research in Science Teaching.

We ask: What are learning goals of science communication training? A comprehensive set of learning goals for future trainings will draw fully from the range of fields that contribute to science communication. Learning goals help decide what to count as success and how to gather evidence of learning. Based on the strands of learning developed for 'learning science in informal environments', we built a conceptually coherent definition of science communication learning that addresses affective issues, content knowledge, methods, reflection, participation, and identity. We reviewed dozens of articles describing science communication training, identifying explicit and implicit learning goals. We identified gaps in outcomes commonly used for training programs; these gaps appeared especially in the areas of affective learning and identity formation. No one program can achieve all learning goals. Different courses might be tailored for scientists who remain in science, wish to become journalists, wish to work for museums, etc. But we believe conceptual coherence can help course designers identify important goals. Creating a common language will increase the ability to compare outcomes across courses and programs. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Media training; science communication; science communication training; scientists as science communicators",,,,,,"1716/12","We based our work on a set of concepts developed for the context of ‘learning science in informal environments’: six strands of learning identified in the 2009 report on informal science learning from the U.S. National Research Council (Bell, Lewenstein, Shouse, & Feder, 2009).

This study focused on astronomy and birding hobbyists and examined how they used organizations to support their hobby engagement. Interviews were conducted with 58 amateur astronomers and 49 birders from the midwestern and southeastern United States. A learning ecology framework was used to map the community contexts with which the hobbyists acted. Results indicated seven contexts that supported the participants’ hobby involvement over time: home, K-12 schools, universities, informal learning institutions, hobby clubs, conferences, and community organizations. Three themes emerged that described how hobbyists interacted with organizations in their communities: (1) organizations provided multiple points of entrance into the science-learning ecosystem, (2) organizations acted as catalysts to facilitate a hobbyist’s development in their hobby, and (3) the relationship between hobbyists and organizations they used for learning eventually became bidirectional. Results showed that both astronomy and birding hobbyists used science-learning organizations to meet their hobby-related learning goals. Most hobbyists in the sample (90% astronomers, 78% birders) also engaged in outreach and shared their hobby with members of their community. Patterns of interaction of the astronomy and birding hobbyists within the seven contexts are discussed. © 2015 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","adult learners; free-choice learning; Hobby",,,,,,"National Science Foundation: ISE 1114500","This work was supported by the National Science Foundation under [Grant number ISE 1114500].",,,,"Astor-Jack, T., Kiehl Whaley, K.L., Dierking, L.D., Perry, D.L., Garibay, C., Investigating socially mediated learning (2007) In principle, in practice: Museums as learning institutions, pp. 217-228. , Falk J.H., Dierking L.D., Foutz S., (eds), Lanham, MD: AltaMira Press, &,.

Few academic resources exist to guide the teaching of communication with non-scientific audiences for an undergraduate science context. This mixed methods study aimed to explore what skills for the effective communication of science with non-scientific audiences should be taught within the Australian Bachelor of Science. This was done to provide a basis from which to establish a teaching resource for undergraduate curriculum development. First, an extensive critique of academic literature was completed to distil the communication ‘skills’ or ‘elements’ commonly cited as being central to the effective communication of science from across the fields of science, communication, education, and science communication. A list of ‘key elements’ or ‘core skills’ was hence produced and systematically critiqued, edited, and validated by experts in the above four fields using a version of the Delphi method. Each of the skills identified was considered by experts to be mostly, highly, or absolutely essential, and the resource as a whole was validated as ‘Extremely applicable’, within the context of teaching undergraduate science students to communicate with non-scientific audiences. The result of this study is an evidence-based teaching resource: ‘12 Core skills for effective science communication’, which is reflective of current theory and practice. This resource may be used in teaching or as a guide to the development of communication skills for undergraduate science students in Australia and elsewhere. © 2015 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Curriculum; Higher Education; Science Communication; Science Education; Undergraduate Skills",,,,,,,,,,,"(2013) Background: Science threshold learning outcomes, , http://www.acds.edu.au/tlcentre/centreprojects/current/, Retrieved from; Cultivating biological literacy (2009) Vision and change in undergraduate biology: A call to action, pp. 10-19. , Brewer C.A., Smith D., (eds), Washington, DC:.

This mixed-methods study examines the relationship between the diversity of youth participants and the organizational and program design features of a broad sample of SET-focused OST programs in the USA. Overall, many programs in our study appeared to deliver high-quality programming by providing immersive experiences for youth that included inquiry-based learning and positive youth development. Encouragingly, many programs served large numbers of underrepresented minority youth and girls and these programs often showed the most numerous indicators of high-quality learning experiences. While location and a diversity-oriented organizational mission were related to youth diversity, highly diverse programs enacted their mission by developing partnerships, engaging communities, local leaders, and families, and delivering long-term, supportive programs for youth. Thus, SET-focused OST programs hold great promise in promoting broad access to rich science experiences, yet specific programmatic and organizational features are highly related to the diversity of youth participants. © 2015 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Equity; informal education; learning activities",,,,,,"Noyce Foundation

However, there is a need to find expedient ways to evaluate the quality of educational experiences resulting from the use of such tools. Towards this end, the approach of this study is to focus on students' behaviours and relate identified behaviour categories to learning theory. An intervention developed as case for this study is presented. The intervention design aimed at setting up a learning environment where bodily, text-based, verbal and social experiences are embedded to facilitate progress towards conceptual understanding via the use of group assignments where students experience phenomena that correspond to focal concepts. To this end, six tasks were designed, five customised for energy-related exhibits and one which gave teachers a role to support students in pulling together the concepts they had encountered. Video recordings were transcribed and analysis investigated the quality of the intervention based on both verbal and non-verbal behaviours during the six tasks. Two overarching learning-related behavioural categories are identified: one reflecting general overall engagement in the learning environment, and a second designated as multi-modal discussions which is indicative of deeper engagement and, in turn, possibility of conceptual learning outcomes. More broadly, this research implies that frameworks based on students' behaviours can contribute to the design of valuable learning experiences and evaluation focusing on relevance for concept learning. © 2015 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","engagement; evaluation; multi-modal discussions; scaffolding; science centre; Science learning",,,,,,,"The funding partners of this study were the Research Council of Norway, and VilVite; Bergen Science Center.",,,,"Anderson, D., Lucas, K.B., Ginns, I.S., Dierking, L.D., Development of knowledge about electricity and magnetism during a visit to a science museum and related post-visit activities (2000) Science Education, 84 (5), pp. 658-679; Ausubel, D.P., (2000) The acquisition and retention of knowledge: A cognitive view, , Dordrect, Boston, MA: Kluwer; Barriault, C., Pearson, D., Assessing exhibits for learning in science centers: A practical tool (2010) Visitor Studies, 13 (1), pp. 90-106; Beard, C., Wilson, J.P., (2013) Experiential learning: A handbook for education, training and coaching, , London: Kogan Page; Bransford, J.D., Schwartz, D.L., Rethinking transfer: A simple proposal with multiple implications (1999) Review of Research in Education, 24, pp. 61-100; Brush, T.A., Saye, J.W., A summary of research exploring hard and soft scaffolding for teachers and students using a multimedia supported learning environment (2002) The Journal of Interactive Online Learning, 1 (2), pp. 1-12; Choo, S.S., Rotgans, J.I., Yew, E.H., Schmidt, H.G., Effect of worksheet scaffolds on student learning in problem-based learning (2011) Advances in Health Sciences Education, 16 (4), pp. 517-528; Cobb, P., Confrey, J., diSessa, A., Lehrer, R., Schauble, L., Design experiments in educational research (2003) Educational Researcher, 32 (1), pp. 9-13; Dalton, S.S., Tharp, R.G., Standards for pedagogy: Research, theory and practice (2002) Learning for life in the 21st century, pp. 181-194. , Claxton G.W.G., (ed), Cambridge: Blackwell, &,.

Pressures of time, lack of support by management and a lack of communicative skills are identified by scientists as reasons for not committing to communicative initiatives. We aimed to explore and explain the organizational culture of a research community that activity communicates with the public and has an international research culture. The Centre for Brain Research (CBR) was identified as a model and was analyzed using the concept of Complex Adaptive Systems (CAS). Twelve participants (scientists (8), clinicians (1), community liaison people (2)) and an identified director of the organization were interviewed. Direct quotes from interview were used to provide examples of the characteristics of CAS for example a variety of agents interacting, adapting the learning within the organization, non-linear dynamic behavior that is a result of aggregates of groups with actions emerging from self-organizing behavior and the development of an emergent culture. This analysis showed that complexity theory was a suitable framework for analyzing the sustainable communicative organization within CBR. © 2015 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Complex Adaptive Systems; Organizational culture; Public engagement; Science communication",,,,,,"Muscular Dystrophy Association

Using identity theory as our analytical lens, we investigated by application of qualitative methodology the socially constructed nature of youth’s identities. We focused on the ways in which learning conversations at the science camp prompted changes in learners’ identity as they engaged in science. Data collection included videotaped observations, field notes, interviews, and journal entries. Interaction analysis and constant comparison were used to develop analytic lenses. The results of our study highlighted the unique affordances of informal science education settings for supporting youth’s identity work in science. In particular, we describe how youth negotiated and authored identities as learners of science through positioning, discourse, and performance. Our study contributed essential insights drawn from empirical data on how youth in an informal science education experience—a science camp—socially negotiated their identities during learning conversations. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","identity development; Informal science education; learning conversations; out-of-school learning; science camps",,,,,,,,,,,"Allen, S., Looking for learning in visitor talk: A methodological exploration (2002) Learning conversations in museums, pp. 259-303. , Leinhardt G., Crowley K., Knutson K., (eds), Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum,.

Previous research suggest that in a well-designed family learning environment, both parents and children can make significant gains in science knowledge, science skills, and positive attitudes toward science, and academic self-efficacy. Families, Organizations, and Communities Understanding Science, Sustainability, and Service (FOCUSSS) is a design-based research project created to blur the boundaries between formal and informal learning contexts: chemistry classrooms (formal environments) and at-home, local, and museum (informal environments). In doing so, adoption of real-world, pro-environmental behaviors can be promoted to have tangible positive impacts on individuals, families, communities, and the environment. Data from this two-year program support that cutting across contexts does indeed correlate with increased self-efficacy in science and positive changes in pro-environmental behavior. Furthermore, the FOCUSSS design framework appears to be quite robust, delivering consistent results across variations including teacher, grade level, school type (neighborhood, charter, private), and parent education. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Design-based research; informal-formal collaborations; pro-environmental behavior; sustainability science",,,,,,"National Science Foundation

W., & Loving, C. C. (2002). Investigation of preservice elementary teachers’ thinking about science. Journal of Research in Science Teaching, 39, 1016–1031]. Results revealed that both increased deference to scientific authority and increased support for science were associated with greater science education and lower religious attendance and revealed two underlying dimensions: an epistemic dimension, combining the deference, epistemology, and science and religion scales, and differing based on religious attendance; and a socioscientific dimension, combining science education for all, economy, environment, and public policy scales, and differing based on science education. In summary, this study suggested that low religious attendance was most strongly associated with support for the value of scientific knowledge and authority, while greater science education was most strongly associated with support for science in schools and society. The effect size for religious attendance was substantially larger than that for science education. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Deference to scientific authority; deficit model; epistemic conflict; religiosity; socioscientific issues",,,,,,,,,,,"Aflalo, E., Religious belief: The main impact on the perception of the nature of science on student teachers (2013) Cultural Studies of Science Education, 8, pp. 623-641; Ajzen, I., Nature and operation of attitudes (2001) Annual Review of Psychology, 52, pp. 27-58; Allum, N., Sturgis, P., Tabourazi, D., Brunton-Smith, I., Science knowledge and attitudes across cultures: A meta-analysis (2008) Public Understanding of Science, 17, pp. 35-54; Anderson, A.A., Scheufele, D.A., Brossard, D., Corley, E.A., The role of media and deference to scientific authority in cultivating trust in sources of information about emerging technologies (2012) International Journal of Public Opinion Research, 24, pp. 225-237; Bak, J., Education and public attitudes toward science: Implications of the “deficit model” of education and support for science and technology (2001) Social Science Quarterly, 82, pp. 779-795; Baker, J.O., Public perceptions of incompatibility between “science and religion (2012) Public Understanding of Science, 21, pp. 340-353; Berinsky, A.J., Huber, G.A., Lenz, G.S., Evaluating online labor markets for experimental research: Amazon.com's Mechanical Turk (2012) Political Analysis, 20, pp. 351-368; Brenner, P.S., Identity importance and the overreporting of religious service attendance: Multiple imputation of religious attendance using the American Time Use Study and General Social Survey (2011) Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion, 50, pp. 103-115; Brossard, D., Lewenstein, B.V., A critical appraisal of models of public understanding of science: Using practice to inform theory (2010) Communicating science, pp. 11-39. , Kahlor L., Stout P.A., (eds), New York: Routledge, &,.

How most effectively to generate and sustain student interest in and preparation for STEM education and careers remains a vexing question, as the content areas, target ages, instructional approaches, and specific purposes of STEM education—and career preparation—are so diverse. Political interest in uncovering means to prepare and engage both larger numbers and more diverse students in STEM fields has extended to the practice of engaging STEM professionals in educational activities with students. What is the empirical evidence about which approaches that rely upon STEM experts to engage students work, and for whom?

As a result, we are awash in efforts designed to increase student interest, education, and potential careers in STEM fields. One prominent strategy has been to capitalize on adults’ enthusiasm and knowledge to help motivate primary and secondary school students’ interest in STEM, through programmes in which adults serve as mentors, volunteers, role models, tutors, or guest speakers.1 How effective is this strategy?","3. Recent examples of federally funded grant competitions that award funds on the basis of prior research evi-dence and strength of proposed research designs include annual grant competitions at the National Science Foundation (e.g. Fundamental Research in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) Edu-cation, Advancing Informal STEM Learning, Improving Undergraduate STEM Education: Education and Human Resources), and at the Department of Education (e.g. grant competitions funded by Investing in Inno-vation (i3) and the National Center for Education Research, at the Institute of Education Sciences).","5. In the USA, programmes such as the US Department of Education’s Investing in Innovation and its recently launched FIRST in the World competitions, the Department of Labor’s Youth Career Connect and Workforce Investment Fund programmes, and the CNCS’s Social Innovation Fund all represent federal initiatives that use potential grantees’ prior evidence of effectiveness to inform funding decisions. Each of these programmes requires grantees to participate in rigorous evaluation activities designed to generate new knowledge about evi-dence in their respective fields. Similarly, US-based foundations are also asking their grantees to assess funded programmes (e.g. the Arnold Foundation, the Robin Hood Foundation, Wallace Foundation, and the W. T. Grant Foundation are among philanthropies that embed rigorous research into funding).","This research was supported by the US National Science Foundation, grant # 1353037.

Inherent in critiques regarding ‘digital natives’ is a need to better understand what the current generation of learners actually do in their social media practices for learning. The survey can help us understand how students actually use social media for learning science. Survey development followed an inductive approach [Brinkman, 2013. Qualitative interviewing.

Newbury Park, CA: Sage], where survey design was informed by results of focus groups with secondary and post-secondary physics students and the survey was iteratively revised after two cycles of administration and validation interviews. The final version of the Social Media and Science Learning Survey can be used by educators and researchers to understand how social media tools can be leveraged in order to allow learning to emerge and to use this knowledge to frame recommendations and methods for integrating these tools into classroom-based environments. © 2016 The Author(s).

Using qualitative video-based data collection and analysis techniques, we conducted two design-based research study iterations that documented interactions between technology, learners, and nature. Children (N = 83) between the ages of 8 and 11 used an iPad-based e-Trailguide designed for a nature trail at a summer camp. Analyses focused on three types of engagement between the learners and the natural world that were facilitated by the e-Trailguide, which we refer to as technology-mediated engagement with nature: (a) observation, (b) pointing, and (c) tactile investigation. Alongside the development of this framework for technology–child–nature interactions, our findings also include the emergence of a learning pattern with regard to technology-mediated engagement with nature: a specific order to the way that children engaged with nature with observations first, pointing second, and tactile investigations third. We also found increased engagement with nature among the children during the second iteration of the study when they used an interactive data collection tool embedded within the e-Trailguide. Design considerations for the future implementation of e-Trailguides in outdoor settings include the incorporation of textual prompts and questions to facilitate observation, development of joint observational activities to encourage collaborative learning, and articulated directions to promote tactile investigations of natural objects. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","engagement; environmental education; informal science learning; Mobile learning; outdoor learning; summer camp",,,,,,,,,,,"Allen, S., Looking for learning in visitor talk: A methodological exploration (2002) Learning conversations in museums, pp. 259-303. , Leinhardt G., Crowley K., Knutson K., (eds), Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Elrbaum Associates,.

The analysis is based on a Delphi study we conducted with Spanish experts from different science-related fields. The results showed that although the experts proposed several examples of scientific knowledge, the degree of consensus reached fell short of the minimum criterion we established. This article seeks to identify the reasons for this lack of consensus by examining the ways in which scientific knowledge was regarded in this Delphi study, the results of which are also compared with other relevant studies on science education for citizens. The analysis reveals that the different professional groups consulted did not, at the start of the Delphi process, place the same degree of emphasis on scientific knowledge. They also differed both in the importance ratings they awarded to the areas of scientific knowledge that had been proposed by the panel as a whole, and in the degree of variance shown by the ratings of each group. Comparison of the present results with the content of previous studies support the importance of selecting a small, common core of scientific knowledge that has both intrinsic and educational value. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","citizens; competence in science; Delphi study; Scientific knowledge",,,,,,"EDU2009-07173, EDU2013-41952-P","This work was supported by the Spanish Government through its 2009 [EDU2009-07173] and 2013 [EDU2013-41952-P] research calls.",,,,"Aikenhead, G.S., Orpwood, G., Fensham, P., Scientific literacy for a knowledge society (2011) Exploring the landscape of scientific literacy, pp. 28-44. , Linder C., Ostman L., Roberts D.A., Wickman P.-O., Erickson G., MacKinnon A., (eds), New York, NY: Routledge, Taylor and Francis Group, &,.

The Synergies project was launched to help deal with this issue. In this paper, we report findings from the first two years of our longitudinal survey research. We sought to understand the nature of the STEM-related interests of 10-/11-year-old youth living in a single urban community and the factors that seem to influence whether these various dimensions of interest increase, stay the same or diminish over time. We found that interest in three STEM dimensions—earth/space science, life science and technology/engineering—increased significantly for youth between the ages of 10/11 and 11/12 years. In contrast to the increase in STEM interest, there was a decrease in participation rates in a variety of STEM activities for the same individuals over the same time frame. We found no correlations between STEM interest and teacher or leader variables. We also found strong positive correlations between all four STEM dimensions and most of the interest-related variables including STEM knowledge, science relevance and science enjoyment. Collectively, this research provides new insights into the nature and processes of youth STEM interest pathways. We are using this empirical foundation with our community partners to improve practice. © 2015 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","community; ecosystem; informal; Interest; STEM",,,,,,"Noyce Foundation","This work was supported by a grant from The Noyce Foundation [SYNERGIES: Understanding and Connecting STEM Learning in the Community].",,,,"(2014) Next generation science standards, , Washington, DC: Author; Alexander, K.L., Entwisle, D.R., Olson, L.S., Lasting consequences of the summer learning gap (2007) American Sociological Review, 72, pp. 167-180; Archer, L., Dewitt, J., Osborne, J., Dillon, J., Willis, B., Wong, B., ‘Doing’ science versus ‘being’ a scientist: Examining 10/11-year-old schoolchildren's constructions of science through the lens of identity (2010) Science Education, 94 (4), pp. 617-639; American Educational Research Journal49, , Archer, L., DeWitt, J., Osborne, J., Dillon, J., Willis, B., & Wong, B.

In this case study, I examined the normative scientific practices reinforced in one-week-long Herpetology (the study of reptiles and amphibians) program for elementary students. In the program, participants identified four practices that they felt were important to herpetology and felt that the practices in which they engaged reflected those of herpetologists in the field. The practices identified by participants (e.g. use of tools, use of scientific vocabulary) aligned with those identified by herpetologists working with the participants in the program. The findings illustrate that program structure plays a significant role in establishing normative scientific practices. This study (1) encourages researchers to question the ways in which normative practices are developed for participants and (2) suggests that practitioners must not only consider the learning outcomes of informal summer programs, but also the opportunities enabled through participation for elementary children. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.","Elementary school;

The Centre's research staff guided tours and outside sociologists made the independent assessment presented here. Hydrogen energy is a technology under development. The question is as follows: Does any risk to its future in consulting the public ‘upstream’ of its full development outweigh any risk in not consulting them? The Hydrogen Centre was started in 2008. In 2011, it opened to three age groups: Baccalaureate students of 14, Tertiary College students of 18–19 and adult members of a Citizens’ Panel. The sociologists (1) observed how the Centre's prototype of micro-generation of hydrogen energy was presented; (2) conducted surveys before their visits—of what visitors knew and wanted to find out, and after—of what they learned; (3) facilitated deliberation in focus groups about what hydrogen implies both globally and for the region and (4) fed back the findings to a meeting of the Centre staff and others in the Low Carbon Research Institute for Wales (at Cardiff University, November 2011). In this paper, we focus on the reticence of Centre staff about the visits—for their research was incomplete and key equipment was lacking at the time. Yet the visitors appear to have learned about hydrogen energy, remedied some mistaken ideas and taken away positive impressions. We conclude that engaging with the public as the technology develops might not be a significant risk to research. Not to do so might be more of a risk. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.","Benefits; Hydrogen energy; Risks; Upstream consultation",,,,,,"UK Energy Research Centre, UKERC

In the context of these environmental deteriorations and ecological crises, teaching about environmental issues and ways to preserve the world's environment has become increasingly important at both national and international levels. Additionally, these issues highlight the necessity of developing wetland centers and determining a means for building understanding of wetlands, water conservation, and water reuse. This study investigated the impact of an onsite wetland environmental education (EE) experience on educators’ attitudes and efficacy. Participants were 13 selected educators currently teaching elementary, middle school, and high school level students. Pre- and post-experience data were collected through an environmental teaching perceptions instrument [Ko, A., & Lee, J. C. (2003). Teachers’ perceptions of teaching environmental issues within the science curriculum: A Hong Kong perspective. Journal of Science Education and Technology, 12(3), 187–204] and a 12-month post-experience focus group interview. Results suggested that the experience did not significantly impact the educators’ attitudes but did impact their EE efficacy; specifically, the educators’ indicated enhanced self-efficacy in teaching EE and heightened perceptions of their abilities to incorporate teaching practices that would positively change students’ EE knowledge, attitudes, and skills. The significant, positive, sustained changes in participants’ efficacy were attributed to the distinctive design of the workshop; an inquiry-based research experience situated within a specific context (a 1,840-acre constructed wetland system) and addressing water reclamation and reuse with a targeted group of educators who have a personal investment in these topics. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.","Attitudes; Environmental education; Professional development; Teacher beliefs",,,,,,"Baylor University","This research was supported in part by grants from the University Research Committee, Baylor University and the John Bunker Sands Wetland Center.",,,,"Appleton, K., Kindt, I., Beginning elementary teachers’ development as teachers of science (2002) Journal of Science Teacher Education, 13 (1), pp. 43-61; Bandura, A., (1986) Social foundations of thought and action: A social cognitive theory, , Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice-Hall; Bandura, A., (1997) Self-efficacy: The exercise of control, , New York, NY: W.

This study examines the association of family education and physical scientists’ informal experiences in science along with the association of informal family science experiences and early initial interest in science through multiple and logistic regression analyses. Research questions addressed are as follows: Controlling for demographic variables, do physical scientists parents’ level of education associate with participation in informal family science experiences? And which informal family science experiences are associated with physical scientists that report an initial personal interest in science by elementary school? These questions are analyzed with survey data from Project Crossover (N = 4,285), a sequential mixed-methods study that examines factors influencing entrance into physical science doctoral programs as well as the transition from graduate students to independent researcher. Results indicate that families with higher parental education are more likely to take part in informal science experiences and therefore more likely to provide positive encouragement for their children to develop an early interest in science. Detailed analyses show that the following family forms of informal science education: occupation, diversions and hobbies, and encouragement are associated with an early initial interest in science by elementary school. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.","Elementary school; Family; Informal education; Interest; Physical science; Quantitative research",,,,,,"National Science Foundation, NSF

While many of these assessments rely on evaluation of individual participant knowledge and skill, they are driven by a broader interest in how such individual outcomes influence the form and function of science in society. Such a science-centered emphasis is neither surprising nor inappropriate. Nonetheless, such appraisals generally do not interrogate the full range of program goals and outcomes. This article advocates for greater comprehensive examination of the effects of PPSR participation on program volunteers. A more integrated perspective is therefore assumed to report on research conducted with volunteers in the Coastal Observation and Seabird Survey Team citizen science program to interrogate the inter- and intrapersonal outcomes of program engagement through narrative interviews and focus groups. Findings highlight that while program participants value the data and research contributions they make, a suite of additional personal outcomes exist beyond these research inputs. Based on these findings, the article provides implications for advancing more intentional and meaningful PPSR efforts by focusing on the scale of engagement and interaction, cultivating community and connection, and developing tiered learning practices. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.","Program management; Public participation in scientific research; Volunteer outcomes",,,,,,,,,,,"Adams, J.D., Ibrahim, S., Lim, M., Invoking the ontological realm of place (2010) Cultural studies and environmentalism: The confluence of ecojustice, place-based (science) education, and indigenous knowledge systems, pp. 215-228. , Tippins D.J., Mueller M.P., Van Eijck M., Adams J.D., (eds), New York, NY: Springer, &,.

The series features talks by science experts from the host campus and around the USA. Each lecture typically attracts between 300 and 600 attendees, including middle and high school student groups, university students, and families and adults from the area. We conducted 47 semi-structured interviews with attendees in order to evaluate their expectancies and motivations. A template analysis of the interviews was grounded in social cognitive and self-determination theories. Results suggest that participants were mostly driven by intrinsic motivations and acquired strong sensory outcome expectancies, such as novelty and activity. Participants also held physical outcome expectancies, such as social expectancies, though to a lesser extent. Both intrinsic and extrinsic motivations to attend the lecture series were associated with expectancies held prior to the event. Of those expectancies, the novelty, entertainment, and social outcomes were dominant. Other noteworthy outcome expectancies include status and self-reactivity. Parents and teachers held outcome expectancies, not only for themselves, but also for their children and students who attended the talks with them. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.","Informal science education; Motivations; Outcome expectancies; Self-determination theory; Social cognitive theory",,,,,,,,,,,"Arcand, K., Watzke, M., Bringing the universe to the street.

The mentor–student interactions captured in the research showed mentors playing supporting roles while students took command of all aspects of building the robot. The students on the team found themselves self-directing, learning, and gaining confidence by doing, and having fun with like-minded peers. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.","Mentoring; Out-of-school-time; Robotics; Student led",,,,,,,,,,,"Antonio, S., (2001) ERIC Digest, , December, Self-directed learning., D169; Aryee, S., Chay, Y.W., An examination of the impact of career-oriented mentoring on work commitment attitudes and career satisfaction among professional and managerial employees (2005) British Journal of Management, 5 (4), pp. 241-249; Bandura, A., (1986) Social foundations of thought and action, , Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice-Hall; Bryman, A., (2011) Loughborough University, Department of Social Sciences, United Kingdom: K. n, , Triangulation and measurement; Converse, N., Lignugaris, B., Evaluation of a school-based mentoring program for at-risk middle school youth (2009) Remedial and Special Education, 30 (1), pp. 33-46; Cranton, P., (1996) Professional development as transformative learning, , San Francisco, CA: Jossey-Bass; Dabney, K.P., Tai, R.H., Almarode, J.L., Miller-Friedlmann, G.S., Sadler, P.M., Hazari, Z., Out-of-school time science activities and their association with career interest in STEM (2012) International Journal of Science Education, Part B, 2 (1), pp. 63-79; DuBois, D.L., Karcher, M.J., (2005) Handbook of youth mentoring, , Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage, &, (Eds; Eby, L.T., Allen, T.D., Evans, S.C., Ng, T., DuBois, D.L., Does mentoring matter?

Framing, as both a theory and an analytic method, has been used to understand how language in the media can affect the audience's concern and intention to act. The theory and the analytic methods of framing were adapted and applied to answer the research question: How do teachers frame climate change in the classroom? Twenty-five lessons from seven teachers were analyzed using semiotic discourse analysis methods. Teachers' frames overlapped to form two distinct discourses: a Science Discourse and a Social Discourse. The dominant Science Discourse can be summarized as follows: Climate change is a current scientific problem that will have profound global effects on the Earth's physical systems. The Social Discourse, used much less often, can be summarized as follows: Climate change is a future social issue because it will have negative impacts on people at the local level. While it is not surprising that the Science Discourse was heard most often in these science classrooms, framing research suggests it is problematic. The research literature on framing indicates that the frames found in the Science Discourse—global scale, scientific statistics and facts, and impact on the Earth's systems—are not likely to inspire action. In contrast, the frames found within the Social Discourse—local scale, impact on humans, and connections to social, economic, and political processes—are more likely to inspire action. The implications for the classroom are discussed. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.","Climate change; Framing; Language; Media; Science communication",,,,,,"Stanford University, SU","The author thanks Rachel Lotan, Nicole Holthuis, and the Stanford Climate Change Education Project for their cooperation and generosity.

Outreach laboratories offer hands-on projects in a situated and authentic learning setting, thereby promoting the development of students’ scientific literacy. However, students’ cognitive achievement within this context is still a subject of study. The aim of our outreach-lab study was twofold: first, we investigated the influence of students’ motivation to learn science on their cognitive achievement. Second, we examined possible gender differences with respect to achievement, cognitive load, and instructional efficiency. We conducted an educational intervention on plant genetic engineering with Bavarian 10th graders (N = 197) in an outreach laboratory. We applied a pre–post design with a follow-up test monitoring students’ motivation to learn science, their cognitive achievement, and cognitive load. The last two variables were combined in the calculation of instructional efficiency. Our results indicated a substantial knowledge increase both in the short term and in the long term (medium to large effect), while highly motivated students achieved higher scores. Furthermore, we found significant gender differences in cognitive achievement and instructional efficiency, revealing that the females had a higher knowledge increase, resulting in a higher instructional efficiency (small to medium effect). Our findings suggest that active engagement in hands-on laboratory activities is especially beneficial for females. Therefore, we recommend improving the quality and quantity of laboratory experiences in science education to overcome gender differences. We discuss some potential implications for teaching. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.","Cognitive load theory; Gender gap; Out-of-school setting; Science education; Science Motivation Questionnaire",,,,,,"DFG BO 944/4-5

We report some results of focus group research which suggest that the American sitcom The Big Bang Theory (2007–present), whose main characters are mostly working scientists, has influenced viewers’ perceptions of NOS. Both scientists and non-scientists were among the audience members participating in the study, thus making it possible to evaluate whether the portrayal of NOS resonates with scientists’ lived experience (using scientists’ reflections on the show) and whether non-scientist audience members come to know something about NOS from the show. Responses from the focus groups suggest that three aspects of NOS were most prominent in participants’ minds: science is empirically based, science is subjective and theory-laden, and, in particular, science is socially and culturally embedded. We argue that a broad understanding of NOS can be cultivated peripherally via regular viewing of this television programme, and a deeper understanding of particular aspects may result when viewers vividly remember specific scenes and storylines. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.","Nature of Science; Science Communication; Science Engagement; Science Fiction; Television; The Big Bang Theory",,,,,,,,,,,"Abd-El-Khalick, F., Examining the sources for our understandings about science: Enduring conflations and critical issues in research on nature of science in science education (2012) International Journal of Science Education, 34 (3), pp. 353-374; Abd-El-Khalick, F., Lederman, N.G., Improving science teachers’ conceptions of nature of science: A critical review of the literature (2000) International Journal of Science Education, 22 (7), pp. 665-701; Allchin, D., Teaching the nature of science through scientific errors (2012) Science Education, 96 (5), pp. 904-926; (1990) Science for all Americans, , New York: Oxford University Press; (1993) Benchmark for science literacy: A Project 2061 report, , New York: Oxford University Press; Barnett, M., Kafka, A., Using science fiction movie scenes to support critical analysis of science (2007) Journal of College Science Teaching, 36 (4), pp. 31-35; Barnett, M., Wagner, H., Gatling, A., Anderson, J., Houle, M., Kafka, A., The impact of science fiction film on student understanding of science (2006) Journal of Science Education and Technology, 15 (2), pp. 179-191; Bednarek, M., Constructing ‘nerdiness': Characterisation in The Big Bang Theory (2012) Multilingua, 31 (2), pp. 199-229; Bell, R.L., Lederman, N.G., Abd-El-Khalick, F., Developing and acting upon one's conception of the nature of science: A follow-up study (2000) Journal of Research in Science Teaching, 37 (6), pp. 563-581; Berne, R.W., Schummer, J., Teaching societal and ethical implications of nanotechnology to engineering students through science fiction (2005) Bulletin of Science, Technology & Society, 25 (6), pp. 459-468; Cavanaugh, T.W., Cavanaugh, C., (2004) Teach science with science fiction films: A guide for teachers and library media specialists, , Worthington: Linworth Publishing; (2008) CSI: The Experience, , http://www.csitheexperience.org/about_mission.html, About the exhibit, mission statement.

The Taiwanese government has publicized 10 declarations on energy conservation and carbon reduction as public behavior guidelines to mitigate global warming. This study uses interviews with quantitative assessment to explore the values and behaviors of 91 Taiwanese people in implementing the declarations. The results of factor analysis reveal that the 10 declarations include 3 value constructs (nature, domestic technology, and transportation technology) and 3 behavior constructs (ease, driving consideration, and vehicle consideration). Correlation and regression analyses show that nature and domestic technology values can predict easy behavior (EB) but cannot predict either consideration behavior. Females have more positive energy values, but not energy behaviors, than males. Age is positively related to EB, and income does not play a significant role in determining either values or behaviors. These results have implications for policy-makers and educators, suggesting that strategies for promoting energy values and behaviors could be made more effective by focusing on relevant gender and age differences. © 2014 Taylor & Francis.","Behavior; Energy conservation; Energy policy; Public perception; Value",,,,,,,,,,,"Barr, S., Factors influencing environmental attitudes and behaviors: A U.K. case study of household waste management (2007) Environment and Behavior, 39, pp. 435-473; Bauer, N., Wallner, A., Hunziker, M., The change of Europe landscapes: Human-nature relationships, public attitudes towards rewilding, and the implications for landscape management in Switzerland (2009) Journal of Environmental Management, 90, pp. 2910-2920; Blum, N., Teaching science or cultivating values?

This study investigated audience engagement with human cloning issues after seeing a performance of Caryl Churchill's 2002 cloning-themed play, A Number, and compared this to the level and quality of engagement shown by people who participated in a group discussion about human cloning. The play prompted a majority of audience members to be engaged with human cloning, markedly increased the salience of the issue for its audience, and brought to light new perspectives on it for them. The proportion of people who reported thinking about human cloning two months after the play was quantitatively similar to those who took part in a group discussion, but the conversations that resulted from each stimulus were qualitatively different, with the play providing a concrete case study that grounded discussion. The unique contributions that popular theatre can offer science communication are discussed. © 2014 Taylor & Francis.","Art; Cloning; Drama; Fiction; Science communication; Theatre",,,,,,,"participating in a citizens’ jury to formally studying science. But at the very least, it is often used to mean increasing the extent to which people think and talk about a science topic and increasing the topic’s discursive salience. Engaging people in discussions about controversial scientific research and new developments in technology is a goal shared by science communication scholars and practitioners of diverse ideological persuasions, from science communicators who seek to promote scientific literacy (exemplified by the Royal Society of London’s seminal report on the public understanding of science; Royal Society of London, 1985) to those more concerned with increasing democratic governance over science and technology (such as a recent Australian government report mapping out a national science engagement strategy; DIISR, 2010). Accordingly, scientists and communicators are increasingly being funded by governments, research institutes and philanthropic organisations to promote this kind of engagement and are encouraged to use creative mediums and means. Research that provides an evidence-based understanding of what works and does not work, and how and why, is then crucial for ensuring engagement means match desired ends. The present study emerged from a practical interest in contributing to that evidence base, with a particular interest in investigating the influence of fiction media on public engagement with science. Specifically, the study aimed to gather data on a theatre audience’s engagement with the topic of human cloning after seeing a play about it, and to assess whether that engagement was qualitatively different from engagement prompted by an alternative stimulus: a simple group discussion on the topic.",,,,"Mabala, R., Allen, K.B., Participatory action research on HIV/AIDS through a popular theatre approach in Tanzania (2002) Evaluation and Program Planning, 25, pp. 333-339; Ball, P., Beyond words: Science and visual theatre (2002) Interdisciplinary Science Reviews, 27 (3), pp. 169-172; Ball, P., Theatre of science: Review of ‘Science on stage: From Doctor Faustus to Copenhagen' by Kirsten Shepherd-Barr (2006) Nature Physics, 2, p. 431; Barnett, M., Wagner, H., Gatling, A., Anderson, J., Houle, M., Kafka, A., The impact of science fiction film on student understanding of science (2006) Journal of Science Education and Technology, 15 (2), pp. 179-191; Bates, B.R., Public culture and public understanding of genetics: A focus group study (2005) Public Understanding of Science, 14, pp. 47-65; Berne, R.W., Schummer, J., Teaching societal and ethical implications of nanotechnology to engineering students through science fiction (2005) Bulletin of Science, Technology & Society, 25 (6), pp. 459-468; Brewer, P.R., Ley, B.L., Media use and public perceptions of DNA evidence (2010) Science Communication, 32 (1), pp. 93-117; Brodie, M., Foehr, U., Rideout, V., Baer, N., Miller, C., Flournoy, R., Altman, D., Communicating health information through the entertainment media (2001) Health Affairs, 20 (1), pp. 192-199; Cormick, C., Cloning goes to the movies (2006) História, Ciência, Saúde—Manguinhos, 13, pp. 181-212; Dasgupta, G., From science to theatre: Dramas of speculative thought (1985) Performing Arts Journal, 9 (2-3), pp. 237-246; Davin, S., Healthy viewing: The reception of medical narratives (2003) Sociology of Health & Illness, 25 (6), pp. 662-679; Dhingra, K., Thinking about television science: How students understand the nature of science from different program genres (2003) Journal of Research in Science Teaching, 40 (2), pp. 234-256; (2010) Inspiring Australia: A national strategy for engagement with the sciences, , Canberra: Department of Innovation, Industry, Science and Research; Do, M.P., Kincaid, L., Impact of an entertainment-education television drama on health knowledge and behavior in Bangladesh: An application of propensity score matching (2006) Journal of Health Communication, 11, pp. 301-325; Ede, S., Science and the contemporary visual arts (2002) Public Understanding of Science, 11, pp. 65-78; Elkamel, F., The use of television series in health education (1995) Health Education Research, 10 (2), pp. 225-232; Frazzetto, G., Science on the stage: Recent plays on scientific topics show that science and theatre have more in common than it appears (2002) EMBO Reports, 3, pp. 818-820; Hannah, D.R., Lautsch, B.A., Counting in qualitative research: Why to conduct it, when to avoid it, and when to closet it (2011) Journal of Management Inquiry, 20, pp. 14-22; Haran, J., Chimba, M., Reid, G., Kitzinger, J., (2008) Screening women in SET: How women in science, engineering and technology are represented in films and on television, , (Research Report Series for UKRC 3).

Our objective is to reflect on conditions for meaningful amateur engagement on Web 2.0 science platforms. Our overall approach is qualitative and ethnographically informed and draws on multiple data sources collected over a period of 18 months: semi-structured interviews, observations, statistical analysis of online activity, and document analysis. We identify a number of factors that enable widespread participation in this naturalist inquiry, organized by Observatoire Naturaliste des Écosystèmes Méditerranéens. Our findings illustrate how the association's double goals of stimulating an appreciation for nature and increasing scientific knowledge of the species under investigation are articulated as both naturalists and the general public participate. This double objective and the inquiry's locus of control—neither scientist-driven nor grassroots-based—lead us to call for a refinement of existing typologies of participatory science projects. This case illustrates how even low-level participation (crowdsourcing type) can produce significant results—not only in terms of generating scientific knowledge, but also in increasing public engagement with science. © 2014 Taylor & Francis.","Citizen science; Commons; Crowdsourcing; Engagement; Participatory science; Saga pedo; Web 2.0",,,,,,"Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada, SSHRC

We argue that a way to provide students with a more realistic view of scientists and their work is to provide them with the opportunity to interact with scientists during short, discussion-based sessions. For that reason, 20 scientists from 8 professional areas were asked to share their experiences of becoming and being a scientist, in short sessions with groups of 7–8 students. The student sample consisted of 223 students between 13 and 15 years. Student and scientist questionnaires were used before and after the sessions to assess students’ views of scientists and their work, and scientists’ experiences of interacting with students. The pre-session questionnaires revealed that students considered scientists as ‘boring’ and ‘nerdy’ whereas after the sessions students focused extensively on how ‘normal’ the scientists appeared to be. The face-to-face interactions with scientists allowed students to view scientists as approachable and normal people, and to begin to understand the range of scientific areas and careers that exist. Scientists viewed the scientist–student interactions as a vehicle for science communication. Implications discussed include the need for future training courses to focus on developing science communicators’ questioning and interaction skills for effective interactions with students. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.","LifeLab; Scientists’ views of public engagement; Scientist–student interactions; Secondary education; Views of scientists",,,,,,"University Hospital Southampton NHS Foundation Trust

Past efforts to reduce public scientific literacy deficits have been overshadowed by calls for dialogue between scientists, science communicators and non-scientists. However, it is unclear how this rhetorical shift has translated into a real change in the guiding principles and practices of UK science engagement. This study investigates reported practices and discourse of UK science engagement practitioners from a variety of professional backgrounds. Quantitative and qualitative data were gathered using questionnaires and focus groups. The analysis employed a theoretical lens informed by Bourdieu's theory of practice, Irwin's taxonomy of first (deficit), second (dialogue) and third (contextual) ‘orders’ of engagement and theoretical conceptualizations of social change from cultural psychology and sociology. Results suggest that participating practitioners’ reported experience was predominately first order, although current definitions and discussions of engagement by a small number of practitioners indicate some limited acceptance of dialogue-oriented thinking. Such potential movement from past practice to current thinking is highly contingent however, not least because so few practitioners had experienced second- or third-order engagement. The implications of these findings are explored both in terms of understanding patterns in UK science engagement and what they portend for Bourdieu's theory of practice and social change. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.","Evaluation; Popularizing science; Public awareness; Public engagement; Qualitative research",,,,,,"National Endowment for Science Technology and the Arts, NESTA: LP0286","This research was funded by the National Endowment for Science, Technology and the Arts (NESTA; LP0286) and conducted at the Open University as part of the Informing Science Outreach and Public Engagement (Isotope; http://isotope.open. ac.uk) Project.

With the use of on-site data collection, investigators of this study collected 144 completed questionnaire surveys from marine museum visitors. Seventeen of these visitors were randomly selected and agreed for an individual 30-minute follow-up interview to solicit their views of environmental awareness and responsibility. Results revealed that visitors who viewed themselves as explorer/facilitator (E&F) outperformed visitors who viewed themselves as experience seeker/recharger on self-concept and self-efficacy. In addition, E&F visitors tended to have a better understanding of conservation, sustainability, human–nature interaction, and science communication. All visitors did possess similar levels of interest and enjoyment during their museum visit.

In this article, we suggest an insightful way to enhance and intensify visitor analyses and adopt a more integrative approach. To this end, we draw attention to Latent Class Analysis (LCA), a classification method that allows us to investigate visitor profiles rather than isolated characteristics while using a mixture of socio-demographic variables and other personal characteristics. We illustrate our suggestion with two examples drawn from a study we conducted at two science museums and two museums of cultural history. The first example shows the use of LCA on variables that are easily assessed and that many museums already have access to through their visitor surveys. The second LCA involves more specific cognitive and motivational visitor variables that are of general importance for learning and that are assumed to be especially important when dealing with conflicting information. Both examples illustrate the additional value of investigating visitor profiles for researchers as well as museum practitioners. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.","Latent class analysis; Museum; Visitor research",,,,,,"Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG: LE1303/8-1","This work was supported by the German Research Foundation under Grant LE1303/8-1.",,,,"Anderson, D., Piscitelli, B., Everett, M., Competing agendas: Young children's museum field trips (2008) Curator: The Museum Journal, 51 (3), pp. 253-273; Ausubel, D.P., (1968) Educational psychology: A cognitive view, , New York, NY: Holt, Rinehart & Winston; Black, G., (2005) The engaging museum: Developing museums for visitor involvement, , Abingdon: Routledge; Bransford, J.D., Brown, A., Cocking, R., (2000) How people learn: Mind, brain, experience and school, expanded edition, , Washington, DC: National Academy Press; Bromme, R., Kienhues, D., Stahl, E., Knowledge and epistemological beliefs: An intimate but complicate relationship (2008) Knowing, knowledge and beliefs, pp. 423-441. , Khine M.S., (ed), New York, NY: Springer, &,.

Bacterial resistance develops through evolutionary mechanisms and knowledge of these helps to explain causes underlying the growing prevalence of resistant strains, as well as important countermeasures to address the problem. A content analysis based on key evolutionary concepts underpinning resistance development was conducted on three different data sources: print newspapers, online websites and biology textbooks. The results revealed that evolutionary mechanisms are seldom included in accounts of antibiotic resistance provided by these sources. One of the included textbooks (n = 6) but none of the newspaper articles (n = 221) or websites (n = 19) covered all six concepts considered in the analysis. A cluster of four concepts regarded as most important for understanding the evolution of resistance development was only included in one news article, one textbook and two websites. Moreover, explanations were seldom supported visually and only two accompanying illustrations were found during the analysis. The results indicated that a large proportion of the Swedish public might never encounter an explanation of antibiotic resistance in evolutionary terms. This could be problematic since increased public awareness and understanding is crucial to counter the issue of bacterial resistance. © 2014 Taylor & Francis.","Antibiotic resistance; Content analysis; Evolution; News media; Textbook analysis",,,,,,"VetenskapsrÃ¥det, VR: 2012-5344","The authors thank Professor Lena Tibell for valuable discussions.

Knowing how to effectively engage their ‘audiences’ is fundamental to the success of both. Both disciplines have well-developed research fields identifying best practice. However, there seems to be an impediment in putting this knowledge into practice, or even much sharing of knowledge between the 2 disciplines. Threshold concepts refer to concepts that are fundamental to thinking and practice in a discipline. In this paper, we argue that engagement is a threshold concept for both science education and science communication. Considering the vast amount of literature on science education and science communication, the focus in this paper is on recent recommendations rather than longstanding, more general notions, providing a contemporary view. This paper illustrates how engagement fulfils the characteristics of a threshold concept for both disciplines and highlights how the 2 fields could assist each other. The purpose of this paper is to spark new conversations and sharing between the 2 disciplines, with the use of threshold concepts as a vehicle for enabling collaboration and progress. © 2014 Taylor & Francis.","Communication; Education; Engagement; Science; Threshold concept",,,,,,,,,,,"Assor, A., Kaplan, H., Roth, G., Choice is good, but relevance is excellent: Autonomy-enhancing and suppressing teacher behaviours predicting students’ engagement in schoolwork (2002) British Journal of Educational Psychology, 72 (2), pp. 261-278; Balfakih, N., The effectiveness of student team-achievement division (STAD) for teaching high school chemistry in the United Arab Emirates (2003) International Journal of Science Education, 25 (5), pp. 605-624; Bandura, A., (1997) Self-efficacy: The exercise of control, , New York, NY: W.H.

To what extent do current life exhibitions reflect aspects of Japanese Shizen as well as recent progress in the life sciences? The purpose of this study was twofold: to analyse the contents of life exhibitions in nine Japanese SMs from both a Japanese Shizen and a contemporary life science perspective. The major findings were: (1) educational missions in natural history institutions appreciated and reflected Japanese indigenous understanding of Shizen in addition to having a scientific understanding of life phenomena; (2) from a life science perspective, among the ‘common traits of life’, ‘evolution’ was the most commonly exhibited trait, while ‘genome’ was the least; and (3) the importance of DNA and genomes in contemporary life sciences was not yet fully appreciated in most of the institutions. The findings implied that in natural history institutions life exhibitions could emerge as a kind of amalgam of Shizen and life science to the visitors. The need for a careful means to avoid the potential misunderstanding of life sciences by visitors is discussed. © 2014 Taylor & Francis.","Exhibition content analysis; Japanese science museum; Life exhibition",,,,,,,,,,,"Aikenhead, G.S., (2006) Science education for everyday life: Evidence-based practice, , New York, NY: Teachers College Press; Aikenhead, G.S., Ogawa, M., Indigenous knowledge and science revisited (2007) Cultural Studies in Science Education, 2, pp. 539-620; Akpanglo-Nartey, R.K., Asabere-Ameyaw, A., Sefa Dei, G.J., Taale, K.D., Children's indigenous ideas and the learning of conventional science (2012) Contemporary issues in African sciences and science education, pp. 63-72. , Asabere-Ameyaw A., Sefa Dei G.J., Raheem K., (eds), Rotterdam: Sense, &,.

Results of these examinations can offer insights into both best practices that could be replicated and possible poor practices that could be avoided in ASP sites. This study describes the validation process that was undertaken on an instrument developed to measure science-related attitudes, and education and career trajectories of students participating in a STEM-focused ASP. We then use the validated instrument to draw certain conclusions about the impact of the ASP program on the participants. We propose a model for predicting students' notions about the importance of science for their future and a model for predicting students' enactment of science agency. The study and the derived instrument may be useful for those interested in examining the impact of STEM-focused ASPs on students' attitudes and proclivities toward science. © 2014 Taylor & Francis.","After-school program; Science agency; STEM interests; Survey validation; Underrepresented students",,,,,,,"While the AFT program has been offered since 2004, the program only began to administer the SAM survey in 2007. Since this time, the survey has been administered on a yearly basis, although there have been changes in researchers involved with the program. From 2004 to 2009, the AFT program was funded through a grant from the National Science Foundation. Since then, the AFT program has been funded by other non-profit sources. The original researchers of the AFT program developed and validated the SAM survey (Ngari et al., 2009). When we took over the research component of the program in 2010, we wanted to replicate the initial validation efforts with the same original data-set and revalidate the survey with the most recent data. The reason we wanted to do this was that we knew that some aspects of the program had changed over the years and we needed to know whether the survey was still valid and reliable. Unfortunately, we were unsuccessful in locating the original raw data used for the initial validation of the survey instrument. Thus we were not able to replicate the initial validation efforts.

In this article, questionnaire data (closed and open-ended questions) from 5,007 Norwegian first-year students in all STEM higher-education disciplines are utilised to describe the role of out-of-school experiences and targeted recruitment efforts in the choice to enter an STEM higher-education programme. Out-of-school experiences were described as the more inspirational by our respondents, contributing to a stable interest for and identification with the STEM field through a long-term educational choice process. Among such experiences, popular science and also fiction or drama with a science component were rated high, whereas museums and science centres were rated lower. Popular science as well as leisure-time activities and experiences in nature were also frequently referred to in open questions. Targeted recruitment efforts are important mainly near educational decision points. The higher-education institutions’ own websites were rated as far more inspirational than campaign websites from official authorities, professional organisations, etc. Commercials, company visits and school counsellors received low ratings as sources of inspiration for an STEM choice, whereas education expositions and visits to or from a higher-education institution were rated somewhat higher. The results suggest that stakeholders wishing to improve STEM participation might consider partnerships with educational institutions, popular science, the media and organisations offering outdoor activities for children and adolescents, in designing information and outreach to improve STEM participation. © 2014 Taylor & Francis.","Educational choice; Higher education; Out-of-school experiences; Recruitment efforts; Science & technology; STEM",,,,,,,,,,,"Andrée, M., Hansson, L., Marketing the ‘broad line’: Invitations to STEM education in a Swedish recruitment campaign (2013) International Journal of Science Education, 35 (1), pp. 147-166; Angell, C., Guttersrud, Ø., Henriksen, E.K., Isnes, A., Physics: Frightful, but fun. pupils’ and teachers’ views of physics and physics teaching (2004) Science Education, 88 (5), pp. 683-706; Archer, L., DeWitt, J., Osborne, J., Dillon, J., Willis, B., Wong, B., Science aspirations, capital, and family habitus: How families shape children's engagement and identification with science (2012) American Educational Research Journal, 49 (5), pp. 881-908; Barmby, P., Kind, P.M., Jones, K., Examining changing attitudes in secondary school science (2008) International Journal of Science Education, 30 (8), pp. 1075-1093; Bennett, J., Hogarth, S., Would you want to talk to a scientist at a party?

The purposes of this study were to examine and compare the impacts of a comic book and a text booklet on conveying the concepts of nanotechnology and to investigate public perceptions of using comics as a tool for science communication. A mixed-methods quasi-experimental design was used to explore these central issues. Three instruments were adopted to assess public knowledge of nanotechnology, public attitudes towards nanotechnology, and public emotional perceptions of learning science. Furthermore, 7 short-answer questions accompanying the posttest as well as interviews were administered to enrich the instrument results. The proportional stratified sampling method was used to recruit more than 300 adults as a pool of participants. Finally, the responses of 194 participants who completed the instruments were analysed. The results indicated that the comic book significantly promoted laypeople's knowledge of and attitudes towards nanotechnology as did the text booklet. It is noted that the comic book increased the participants' interest in and enjoyment of learning, while the text booklet decreased their interest and enjoyment. More comic readers were interested in learning nanotechnology via comics than text readers were interested in learning via text. Although there was no significant difference between the 2 media in the aspects of knowledge and attitude, the results of emotional perceptions imply that science comics have the potential to develop laypeople's ongoing interest and enjoyment for learning science by reading comics. © 2014 Taylor & Francis.","Attitudes towards nanotechnology; Informal environments; Interest in science learning; Knowledge of nanotechnology; Science comics",,,,,,"NSC 100-2511-S-110-004-MY3, 101-2511-S-018-019","The authors thank the two reviewers for their thoughtful comments on early drafts of the paper, Sharyl A.

Surveys and polls regularly measure whether the public accepts evolutionist or creationist views. The differences between groups, such as people from various countries, are then explained by variations in religious views. But what is often overlooked, is that the data also show that a large proportion of the population, about one-third, is unsure what to believe. This figure generally goes unnoticed. We argue that the emphasis on religious variables obscures another, perhaps more important, variable: the conceptual understanding of evolution. This factor may help explain why so many people are unsure about evolution and offers a greater potential to increase public understanding and acceptance of the theory, perhaps with the active involvement of science educators. © 2014 Taylor & Francis.","Accepting evolution; Conceptual obstacles; Creationism; Evolution; Understanding evolution",,,,,,,,,,,"Berkman, M., Plutzer, E., (2010) Evolutionism, creationism, and the battle to control America’s schools, , New York: Cambridge University Press; Berkman, M., Plutzer, E., Defeating creationism in the courtroom, but not in the classroom (2011) Science, 331 (6016), pp. 404-405; (2012), http://www.gallup.com/poll/155003/hold-creationist-view-human-origins.aspx, In U.S., 46% Hold creationist view of human origins.

The habitat that remains is critical for providing urban areas with ecosystem services and maintaining biodiversity, yet is often insufficiently monitored by environmental agencies due to a lack of resources. To help fill this void, the Urban-Rural Biomonitoring and Assessment Network (URBAN) was developed as a citizen science education and outreach program for Hamilton, Ontario, Canada. Through this program, volunteers gain insight into the dynamics of biological systems, learn how to identify species, and may experience growth personally in terms of environmental stewardship or even career path decisions. The implementation and development of URBAN followed a nine-step model developed by the Cornell Lab of Ornithology. Here, we offer an overview of URBAN's development, successes, and challenges by utilizing this citizen science model as a guideline. © 2013 Taylor & Francis.","Biomonitoring; Citizen science; Education; Public participation",,,,,,"McMaster University","With financial support granted by McMaster University through the RBC Blue Water Fund, the URBAN program was developed using the Cornell Lab of Ornithology’s nine-step citizen science program model developed by Bonney et al. (2009). The model includes the following nine steps: (1) choose a scientific question; (2) form a scientist/educator/technologist/evaluator team; (3) develop, test, and refine protocols, data forms, and educational support materials; (4) recruit participants; (5) train participants; (6) accept, edit, and display data; (7) analyze and interpret data; (8) disseminate results; and (9) measure outcomes (Bonney et al., 2009). This model allows outreach programs to successfully meet the goals of recruiting participants, completing research, and public education, while achieving sustainable operation in future years. We discuss the development of URBAN through this model, its impacts, challenges, and future growth.","Funding for URBAN must be renewed annually and there is no guaranteed multi-year funding. Without this, we cannot recruit and retain qualified staff to train volunteers. We have to replace the current Program Coordinator, and it will be difficult to find a person who is both an MMP Regional Coordinator and an OBBN certified member without a multi-year contract. Without sustained and guaranteed program funding, retaining qualified staff will continue to be a challenge.","We gratefully acknowledge the significant contributions of the RBC Blue Water Fund for making this program possible and the continued support from the Faculty of Science at McMaster University over the years. Our collaborators are integral to the success of the program and they include the Royal Botanical Gardens, Bay Area Restoration Council, Hamilton Conservation Authority, Halton Region Conservation Authority, Grand River Conservation Authority, City of Hamilton, Marsh Monitoring Program, Ontario Benthos Biomonitoring Network, and the Hamilton Naturalists’ Club.

For these changes to be effective, professional stakeholders need to understand fundamental concepts in flood science of which they may have no prior knowledge or experience. Engagement with flood science research is therefore critical to developing the knowledge needed effectively to manage flood hazards. This paper assesses the implementation and evaluation of learning and communication strategies designed to encourage the exchange of flood-related knowledge between academic researchers and local government representatives. Ninety-six local government officers and 27 elected representatives with a role and/or interest in flooding, from three administrative districts, participated in workshops delivered in one of three pedagogically distinct styles: tutor-led classroom-based, tutor-led virtual, or participant-led role-play. Cutting-edge flood science knowledge, delivered by expert flood scientists via short videos, formed a key element of all workshops, while local case-study material provided context and resonance. Participants' experiences of the workshops, and the perceived impact on flood-related knowledge and skill development, were investigated using a mixed-methods approach incorporating pre- and post-workshop surveys, semi-structured interviews, and direct observation. Findings imply an overall positive impact on knowledge, skills, and decision-making ability, although some significant variation is identified relating to workshop style and professional role. While results suggest no ideal approach to knowledge exchange, the paper identifies challenges and opportunities for the strategies developed, makes recommendations for good practice, and offers suggestions for further research. © 2013 Taylor & Francis.","Communication strategies; Evaluation; Flood science; Knowledge exchange; Local government; Stakeholder engagement",,,,,,,,,,,"Alexander, M., Viavattene, C., Faulkner, H., Priest, S., Translating the complexities of flood risk science using KEEPER—A knowledge exchange exploratory tool for professionals in emergency response (2013) Journal of Flood Risk Management; Arnstein, A., A ladder of citizenship participation (1969) Journal of the American Institute of Planners, 26, pp. 216-233; Bandura, A., (1986) Social foundations of thought and action: A social cognitive theory, , Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice-Hall; Beierle, T.C., The quality of stakeholder-based decisions (2002) Risk Analysis, 22, pp. 739-749; (2008) The Pitt review: Learning lessons from the 2007 floods, , London: Cabinet Office; Campbell, J., Mayer, R.E., Questioning as an instructional method: Does it affect learning from lectures?

Ciencia Puerto Rico, a non-profit group interested in promoting science literacy and education among Latino(a)s/Hispanics, identified a need to provide schools with culturally relevant materials. The result was the publication of the book ¡Ciencia Boricua! Ensayos y anécdotas del científico puertorro, an anthology of short, multidisciplinary science essays written by Puerto Rican scientists to develop awareness of Puerto Rican science and scientists. The purposes of this manuscript are (a) to provide evidence of instances of contextualization and cultural relevance in ¡Ciencia Boricua!, and (b) to determine the extent to which the use of ¡Ciencia Boricua! and related activities changed the perception toward science of 57 elementary and middle school students enrolled in a public school in Puerto Rico, and which contextualized science activities students preferred. The results showed that the contextualized activities improved the perception about science in many children, particularly boys. Students preferred activities with more interactivity, like presenting their science posters during Closing Night, visiting a science laboratory, and receiving guest scientists at the school. Results showcase a successful strategy for developing culturally relevant and contextualized science education resources. © 2014 Taylor & Francis.","Contextualization; Cultural relevance; Informal science education; Puerto Rico; Science literacy",,,,,,,"Ciencia Puerto Rico would like to thank the students and the teachers who participated in the study; Fundación Banco Popular de Puerto Rico and Pfizer for their financial support in publishing ¡Ciencia Boricua! and bringing it to schools; and the Centro de Investigación y Evaluación Sociomédica for their mentoring and advice regarding the assessment of this study.",,,,"Apple, M., (1986) Teachers and texts: A political economy of class and gender relations in education, , New York, NY: Routledge & Kegan Paul; Ares, N., Multidimensionality of cultural practices: Implications for culturally relevant science education (2011) Cultural Studies of Science Education, 6 (2), pp. 381-388; Banks, J.A., McGee-Banks, C.A., (1995) Handbook of research on multicultural education, , New York, NY: Macmillan; Barba, R.H., A study of culturally syntonic variables in the bilingual/bicultural science curriculum (1993) Journal of Research in Science Teaching, 30 (9), pp. 1053-1071; Belloni, M., Cox, A.J., Strategies for adopting interactive engagement methods (2007) The Physics Teacher, 45 (6), pp. 395-397; Bulte, A.M.W., Westbroek, H.B., De Jong, O., Pilot, A., A research approach to designing chemistry education using authentic practices as contexts (2006) International Journal of Science Education, 28 (10), pp. 1063-1086; Colón Ramos, D.A., Cucarachas, un modelo de la mente (2011) Ciencia Boricua!

It also examines the support these students feel are necessary to be successful in their roles, as well as what they feel the experience has taught them about science communication. Results from both qualitative and quantitative data, including surveys, interviews, observations, and artifact collection indicate that the most common experiences that the students had in the schools were assisting teachers in conducting labs, leading small group activities/discussions with students in class, demonstrating scientific content, procedures, tools, and techniques, and assisting teachers in teaching lessons. Most students felt these activities benefited their ability to work as a team, lead a team, facilitate group discussions, teach STEM concepts and methods, and generate others' interest in STEM research and activities. However, it was found that some tasks that the students were involved in provided more of a chance to practice their science communication skills than others. In order to be successful in these roles, nearly all of the students felt that support from the classroom teacher they were working with was necessary. © 2013 Taylor & Francis.","School–university partnership; Science communication",,,,,,"National Science Foundation, NSF

In their most recent evaluation of the GK-12 program (NSF, 2010), a majority of teachers indicated that the GK-12 program had positive effects on their K-12 students’ STEM knowledge and skills. In her study of middle school students, Ferreira (2007) found that the students who participated in the program had access to scientists and mathematicians who shared with them how scientific knowledge is translated into real world applications. Students who were typically disengaged from the learning process showed increased interest in and positive attitudes toward science and mathematics. Laursen, Liston, Thiry, and Graf (2007) found that the K-12 students were engaged in authentic hands-on activities that generated interest in science and new views of science and scientists. Iskander and Kapila (2012) evaluated Project Revitalizing Achievement by Using Instrumentation in Science Education (RAISE), which was a partnership supported through a grant from the NSF GK-12 Fellows program. They compared RAISE high school classes to non-RAISE classes and found that: (a) a slightly larger percentage of RAISE project students took standardized exams; (b) a larger percentage of RAISE project students passed the exams; and (c) the average grade attained by RAISE project students was slightly higher.","The partnership is funded by the NSF as part of its Math Science Partnership program. The partnership was designed to target the middle school experiences of students in science and engineering as they transition to high school. The project focus is on teacher professional development with an emphasis on science inquiry content and pedagogical content knowledge through interdisciplinary science and engineering research experiences in science labs, development of science and technology classroom materials that are aligned with state science learning standards, and inquiry-based curricula. The partnership was designed to take a mentoring approach to teacher professional development by creating PLCs or collaborative working groups, that are geared toward cultivating mentoring relationships with middle and high school teachers and students, STEM college faculty, education faculty, STEM undergraduate and graduate students, volunteer STEM professionals, and parents.","Relevant documents were collected during the 2011–2012 and 2012–2013 school years pertaining to the partnership. All undergraduate students involved in the partnership submitted at least 10 journal reflections describing their experiences in the partnership. Archival records were collected, including the partnership proposal for funding from NSF as well as project summaries and reports.","The materials reported in this paper are based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation under Grant No. DUE-1102998 and project title of the University at Buffalo/Buffalo Public Schools Interdisciplinary Science and Engineering Partnership (PI: Joseph A.

In particular, science museums focus on the historical context of scientific discoveries by displaying authentic objects, defined as original objects that once served a science-related, real-world purpose and bear some significance for the history of science. However, almost nothing is known about the respective role of authentic objects. By displaying a set of objects either as originals or replicas in a large museum of the history of science and technology, we examined the relevance of authentic objects for museum visitors. An extensive set of interviews unveiled four dimensions of authenticity, interestingly not only connected with the historical significance of the objects but also with their science-related functionality. Furthermore, it revealed a multitude of criteria for the evaluation of objects that were mostly independent of authenticity but instead referred to the objects' provision of insights into scientific and technological principles. Thus, the study shows that it should be of great importance to complement authentic objects with features that provide additional science-related information. How this connection can be most successful requires further research. © 2014 Taylor & Francis.","Authentic objects; Informal science learning; Replica; Science museum; Visitor studies",,,,,,,,,,,"Afonso, A.S., Gilbert, J.K., Educational value of different types of exhibits in an interactive science and technology center (2007) Science Education, 91, pp. 967-987; Allen, S., Gutwill, J., Designing with multiple interactives: Five common pitfalls (2004) Curator, 47, pp. 199-212; Arya, D.J., Maul, A., The role of the scientific discovery narrative in middle school science education: An experimental study (2012) Journal of Educational Psychology, 104, pp. 1022-1032; Bell, P., Lewenstein, B., Shouse, A.W., Feder, M.A., (2009) Learning science in informal environments.

It is, therefore, vital that an evidence-based approach is used when reporting on climate change. Yet, multiple and arguably irreconcilable tensions exist between science and mass media. For example, as media workers are trained to provide a ‘balanced’ approach, this can result in bias in climate change reporting. Additionally, various industry-related pressures mean that mainstream journalists often have limited resources and time to check the accuracy of their climate news stories with researchers. Such tensions and media coverage of alleged climate research misconduct formed the basis of a survey we have developed for an interface group of researchers and journalists who have a vested interest in climate science. The aim of this survey is to compare their attitudes on the performance of the media as a channel of climate change information. The survey was conducted in mid-2010, with responses from journalists and researchers who attended international fora for science–media interface and research integrity discussions, or accessed the survey via an international climate research programme website. Survey findings reveal, contrary to tensions described in the existing literature, a mutual intelligibility and general trust between this core group of journalists and researchers, who have a vested interest in evidence-based climate science reporting. We argue that scientifically informed interface journalists, by collaborating with scientists, can help influence mainstream journalists to better inform the public about the urgency for society to overcome the diabolical climate challenge. © 2013 Taylor & Francis.","Climate change; Diabolical challenge; Mass media; Mutual intelligibility; Trust",,,,,,,,,,,"Anderson, A., Media, politics and climate change: Towards a new research agenda (2009) Sociology Compass, 3 (2), pp. 166-182; Antilla, L., Self-censorship and science: A geographical review of media coverage of climate tipping points (2010) Public Understanding of Science, 19 (2), pp. 240-256; Bell, A., Media (mis)communication on the science of climate change (1994) Public Understanding of Science, 3 (3), pp. 259-275; Biermann, F., Abbott, K., Andresen, S., Bäckstrand, K., Bernstein, S., Betsill, M., Bulkeley, H., Folke, C., Navigating the anthropocene: Improving earth system governance (2012) Science, 335 (6074), pp. 1306-1307; Billett, S., Dividing climate change: Global warming in the Indian mass media (2010) Climatic Change, 99 (1), pp. 1-16; Boykoff, M.T., Flogging a dead norm?

When it comes to television news, heavy viewers held stronger opinions than light viewers on the key issue attributes.

Nevertheless, they need to reason about these issues. The present interview study investigates the concrete reasoning about and resolution of a scientific conflict between knowledge claims put forward by medical experts in 21 laypersons and 20 intermediately knowledgeable persons. Results showed that explanation patterns were influenced by assumptions about not only the tentative nature of knowledge but also about the person of the expert and the institutional practice of science. When trying to resolve the conflict, both groups reported significantly more strategies of evaluating and validating the source rather than assessing the claim's veracity based on their own understanding. Hence, when facing scientific conflicts, source validation and deference to another's expertise is rather the rule than the exception. Modern societies are based on an elaborate division of cognitive labor, underlining the need to evaluate the social context in which knowledge claims are derived. The discussion derives implications for learning and instruction. © 2014 Taylor & Francis.","Reasoning; Science communication; Scientific literacy",,,,,,"Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG: BR 1126/6-1","This research was supported by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG), grant BR 1126/6-1.

Using a case study methodology, researchers analysed video records of 10 families (25 people) using mobile technologies with naturalists at an arboretum to understand how mobile devices supported science talk related to tree biodiversity. The conceptual framework brings together research on technological supports for science learning and research on strategies that encourage families to engage in conversations that support observation and explanation practices. Findings suggested that families engaged in high levels of perceptual talk (describing and identifying) while using mobile computers. Commonly, families articulated scientific observations when supported by prompts, visuals, and scaffolds delivered by the mobile computers. Families struggled to make explanations about the biological importance of what they saw in relation to ecological principles; however, families made connections to their everyday life within explanations they developed at the arboretum. Our research showed the importance of mobile supports that provided on-demand, localised sense-making resources for explanation building while limiting observational complexity. © 2013 Taylor & Francis.","Augmented reality; Ecology; Informal science; Mobile technology; Parent–child interaction; Science practices; Science reasoning",,,,,,,"Science Talk Supported by Tree Investigators",,,,"Allen, S., Looking for learning in visitor talk: A methodological exploration (2002) Learning conversations in museums, pp. 259-304. , Leinhardt G., Crowley K., Knutson K., (eds), Mahwah, NJ: LEA,.

The curriculum, materials, and agendas for the course were developed by education staff and complemented a permanent life science exhibition. The researcher developed a content test based on the course instructional objectives and lessons provided by education staff. In addition, all participating elementary and middle school teachers (n = 62) were asked to complete an evaluation at the end of each day's session. This included several questions that required participants to reflect upon the content presented throughout the course of the day, focusing on their satisfaction and effectiveness of instruction. Overall, teacher responses on the daily and final evaluations for both courses were extremely positive. However, after participating in the ISI course, teachers’ gains in science content knowledge were not as strong as they had perceived. The findings described here can assist developers of informal science professional development for elementary and middle school teachers that desire to incorporate inquiry, pedagogy, and science content into their teacher learning experiences. © 2013 Taylor & Francis.","Informal education; Science centre; Teacher knowledge",,,,,,,,,,,"Anderson, D., Kisiel, J., Storksdieck, M., Understanding teachers’ perspectives on field trips: Discovering common ground in three countries (2006) Curator: The ISI Journal, 49 (3), pp. 365-386; Anderson, D., Lawson, B., Mayer-Smith, J., Investigating the impact of a practicum experience in an aquarium on pre-service teachers (2006) Teaching Education, 17 (4), pp. 341-353; Astor-Jack, T., Balcerzak, P., McCallie, E., Professional development and the historical tradition of informal science institutions: Views of four providers (2006) Canadian Journal of Science, Mathematics and Technology Education, 6 (1), pp. 67-81; Astor-Jack, T., McCallie, E., Balcerzak, P., Academic and informal science education practitioner views about professional development in science education (2007) Science Education, 91 (4), pp. 604-628; (2009) Learning science in informal environments: People, places, and pursuits, , Bell, P., Lewenstein, B., Shouse, A.

The literature on students' understanding of gravity identifies a number of alternative conceptions prevalent, several of which are mirrored in this study. The concept of gravity was demonstrated to learners in a number of ways at the study site, using exposition, models and direct experience of its effects. Using interviews with students, and drawing on a human constructivist framework, the paper shows how knowledge about gravity was acquired incrementally, through subsumption, and more substantially, through greater knowledge restructuring. In addition to students' understanding of the cause of gravity, particular attention is paid to their perception of how it operates on bodies in the solar system. Networks of activity involving the effects of gravity which result in significant knowledge restructuring are recommended as providing the most substantial learning experience in an informal environment such as a science centre. © 2013 Taylor & Francis.","Astronomy education; Gravity; Human constructivism; Informal learning; Science centre; Solar system; Space",,,,,,,,,,,"Adelman, L.M., Falk, J.H., James, S., Impact of national aquarium in Baltimore on visitors’ conservation attitudes, behavior and knowledge (2000) Curator, 43 (1), pp. 33-61; Allen, S., Exhibit design in science museums: Dealing with a constructivist dilemma (2007) In principle, in practice, pp. 43-56. , Falk J., Dierking L., Foutz S., (eds), Plymouth: AltaMira Press,.

The boundaries between formal and informal education continue to breakdown, making the need to understand and address the needs of learners of all ages, across multiple settings and situations more important than ever. Learning is becoming increasingly ‘on-demand’, mediated by ‘colleagues’ and initiated in order to solve learner-defined needs and interests (as opposed to the historical condition of prescribed, sequential curricula defined by nameless, faceless experts).

Zoos can play a role in the development of scientific literacy in the fields of animal biology and biodiversity conservation via conservation education programmes by building on existing knowledge, as well as by challenging and correcting misconceptions. A survey of the knowledge and understanding of groups of zoo visitors about a variety of topics in animal biology was carried out. The study found that the knowledge and understanding of zoo visitors regarding basic animal biology is fairly secure but that their ideas about more complex concepts, such as ecological interdependence and physiological needs are unsophisticated and, at times, confused. Visitors found some topics to be particularly challenging, and some common misconceptions have been identified. However, in other topics they have shown their understanding to be greater than would perhaps be expected from the existing literature. The findings enabled a modified version of the Conservation Triangle proposed by Tunnicliffe [(1999). Zoos as centres of conservation education for primary school pupils.

Besides the traditional attention to scientific knowledge, national curricula are therefore increasingly emphasizing critical and reflexive engagement with media content as a key objective of science education. Despite this curricular emphasis, there are few methods for teaching media literacy in science class. Here, we apply frame analysis to meet this challenge. Based on a previously described framing scheme for classifying gene-related information into five gene frames, we developed a pilot teaching programme for upper secondary school biology. Thirty-four students from two parallel classes were taught how to identify gene frames in media texts. The programme was placed at the end of their conventional genetics teaching, so that the students already had a basic knowledge in genetics. Learning outcomes were evaluated with pre- and post-test word association maps and focus group interviews, as well as analysis of the classroom work. We found that the students fully grasped the idea that there are different ways of framing the gene concept and they were able to recognize the different gene frames in newspaper texts. We also saw a shift in how the students used the gene concept, from a simplistic and deterministic perspective to a more dynamic and evolutionary understanding of genetic causation. In addition, the students became more critical of media claims. We, thus, conclude that frame analysis of gene-related news stories represents an effective activity for promoting media literacy and more insight into genetic causation. © 2013 Taylor & Francis.","Framing; Genes; Media literacy; Science education",,,,,,,,,,,"Bubela, T., Nisbet, M.C., Borchelt, R., Brunger, F., Critchley, C., Einsiedel, E., Caulfield, T., Science communication reconsidered (2009) Nature Biotechnology, 27, pp. 514-518; Carver, R., Waldahl, R., Breivik, J., Frame that gene–A tool for analysing and classifying the communication of genetics to the public (2008) EMBO Reports, 9, pp. 943-947; Carver, R.B., Rødland, E.A., Breivik, J., Quantitative frame analysis of how the gene concept is presented in tabloid and elite newspapers Science Communication, , in press; Condit, C.M., How geneticists can help reporters to get their story right (2007) Nature Reviews Genetics, 8, pp. 815-820; Condit, C.M., Ofulue, N., Sheedy, K.M., Determinism and mass-media portrayals of genetics (1998) American Journal of Human Genetics, 62, pp. 979-984; Dougherty, M.J., Closing the gap: Inverting the genetics curriculum to ensure an informed public (2009) The American Journal of Human Genetics, 85, pp. 6-12; Duncan, R.G., Reiser, B.J., Reasoning across ontologically distinct levels: Students’ understandings of molecular genetics (2007) Journal of Research in Science Teaching, 44, pp. 938-959; Duncan, R.G., Rogat, A.D., Yarden, A., A learning progression for deepening students’ understandings of modern genetics across the 5th-10th grades (2009) Journal of Research in Science Teaching, 46, pp. 655-674; Entman, R.M., Framing: Toward clarification of a fractured paradigm (1993) Journal of Communication, 43, pp. 51-58; Falk, J.H., Storksdieck, M., Dierking, L.D., Investigating public science interest and understanding: Evidence for the importance of free-choice learning (2007) Public Understanding of Science, 16, pp. 455-469; Forissier, T., Clement, P., Teaching ‘biological identity’ as genome/environment interactions (2003) Journal of Biological Education, 37, pp. 85-90; Gamson, W.A., Modigliani, A., Media discourse and public opinion on nuclear power: A constructionist approach (1989) The American Journal of Sociology, 95, pp. 1-37; Gericke, N., (2008) Science versus school-science: Multiple models in genetics–The depiction of gene function in upper secondary textbooks and its influence on students’ understanding (Doctoral dissertation).

This study reports on the development and validation of a Views of Science News Instruction Questionnaire (VSNIQ) designed to explore Grade 7 (12–13 years old) students' views of reasoning with respect to science news. Forty items based on related literature, an expert's comments, and interviews of students with different achievement levels were developed. A pilot study of Grade 7 students (N = 415) identified eight items that did not meet reliability, discrimination, and difficulty expectations. The final 32-item VSNIQ was administered to 391 Grade 7 students taught by 4 different teachers using different instructional approaches in a Taiwanese secondary school. A confirmatory factor analysis of student responses revealed four dimensions (interest, authority, judgment, and practicality) aligned with the original design structure. Cronbach α analyses revealed internal consistency values of the overall questionnaire and subscales (0.86, 0.92, 0.87, 0.93, and 0.81). Discriminate validity was adequate to detect differences in the performance of groups of students taught by instruction systematically supplemented with respect to science news and similar students taught by conventional instruction without systematic usage of science news articles. Overall, Taiwanese Grade 7 students hold moderate views of using science news (total score M = 92.77. SD = 16.46). A systematic science news instruction that addresses the intentionality of learners to apply science knowledge and actively interact with authors' ideas would enhance students' use of science news (F(3,387) = 9.16, p &lt;.001, η2p=.07). © 2013 Taylor & Francis.","Adolescents; Intentionality; Science news",,,,,,"National Science Council, NSC: NSC98-2628-S-003-001-MY3, NSC101-2511-S-003-017-MY3","This study is granted by the National Science Council in Taiwan (NSC98-2628-S-003-001-MY3, NSC101-2511-S-003-017-MY3).

To that end, two sources of conceptions were compared: the students’ personal concepts (from a consolidated bibliography and from an experimental sample) and the concepts conveyed by cinema. After categorising and analysing, the students' persistent preconceptions were compared with those conveyed by cinema. The study reveals that the concepts conveyed by films can reinforce students’ misconceptions and become learning obstacles. Based on these results, implications for further practice are shown. We present a didactic proposal that begins with the explanation of the misconceptions and promotes a conceptual change. © 2013 Taylor & Francis.","Conceptual change; Misconception; Science-media interface",,,,,,,,,,,"Abd-El-Khalick, F., BouJaoude, S., Duschl, R.A., Hofstein, A., Lederman, N.G., Mamlok, R., Niaz, M., Tuan, H., Inquiry in science education: International perspectives (2004) Science Education, 88, pp. 397-419; Aikenhead, G., An analysis of four ways of assessing student beliefs about STS topics (1988) Journal of Research in Science Teaching, 25, pp. 607-627; Albaladejo, C., Lucas, A.M., Pupils’ meanings for ‘mutation’ (1988) Journal of Biological Education, 22, pp. 215-219; Arroio, A., Context based learning: A role for cinema in science education (2010) Science Education International, 21, pp. 131-143; Ayuso, G.E., Banet, E., Relaciones Genética-Evolución en la Educación Secundaria.

(Peoples, Animals and Nature) by monitoring changes in their respective knowledge as well as in their environmental attitudes. The programme was conducted in Côte d'Ivoire in West Africa with the help of the local teacher's organization Cellule des Projets Environnementaux (CPE). We used multivariate analysis of data collected during two years of the programme (n = 1,244 participants), in nine villages around the Taï National Park, to test if this EE programme could lead to (1) knowledge gain and (2) attitude change, and the influences of (3) grade, sex and prior knowledge. Participation significantly increased environmental knowledge and positively influenced attitudes towards nature. Boys gained more knowledge and changed attitudes more than girls and pupils of the sixth grade profited more from the programme on both measures than the younger pupils of the fifth grade. We discuss how these results influence the programme and how further research should be emphasized. © 2013 Taylor & Francis.","Adolescents; Attitudes; Environmental education; Evaluation; Knowledge; West Africa",,,,,,"WWF International, WWF

However, little in the literature addresses what informal science educators know about science and, in particular, the views they have about NOS. In this study, informal science educators were asked to fill out an online version of the Views of Nature of Scientific Knowledge—Form C questionnaire [Abd-El-Khalick, F., & Lederman, N. G. (2000).

Along with interview responses, 20 of the fully completed questionnaires were purposefully selected to provide the data for this study. Participants were included if they were actively teaching full time to the public in informal science settings. This criterion for inclusion was utilized in order to address the lack of research about this category of individuals. The surveys underwent qualitative analysis and were coded using a scoring rubric. Overall, participants' demonstrated a strong understanding about NOS but views about the certainty of science were prevalent. © 2013 Taylor & Francis.","Informal education; Nature of Science; Teacher knowledge",,,,,,,,,,,"Abd-El-Khalick, F., Embedding nature of science instruction in pre-service elementary science courses: Abandoning scientism, but… (2001) Journal of Science Teacher Education, 12 (3), pp. 215-233; Abd-El-Khalick, F., Lederman, N.G., The influence of history of science courses on students’ views of nature of science (2000) Journal of Research in Science Teaching, 37 (10), pp. 1057-1095; Afonso, A.S., Gilbert, J.K., Educational value of different types of exhibits in an interactive science and technology center (2007) Science Education, 91, pp. 967-987; Akerson, V.L., Hanson, D.L., Cullen, T.A., The influence of guided inquiry and explicit instruction on K-6 teachers’ views of nature of science (2007) Journal of Science Teacher Education, 18 (5), pp. 751-772; (1993) Benchmarks for science literacy, , New York, NY: Oxford University Press; (1994) Science for all Americans, , WashingtonDC: Author; (1984) Museums for a new century: A report of the commission on museums for a new century, , Washington, DC: Author; (2000) Excellence in practice: Museum education standards and principles, , Washington, DC: American Association of Museums; Astor-Jack, T., Balcerzak, P., McCallie, E., Professional development and the historical tradition of informal science institutions: Views of four providers (2006) Canadian Journal of Science, Mathematics and Technology Education, 6 (1), pp. 67-81; Bailey, E.B., The professional relevance of museum educators (2006) Journal of Museum Education, 31 (3), pp. 155-160; Bailey, E.B., Researching museum educators’ perceptions of their roles, identity, and practice (2006) Journal of Museum Education, 31 (3), pp. 175-198; Bybee, R.W., Achieving scientific literacy: Strategies for insuring that free-choice science complements national formal science education efforts (2001) Free-choice science education: How we learn science outside of school, pp. 44-63. , Falk J.H., (ed), New York, NY: Teachers College Press,.

However, few studies address the notion of authenticity from the participants' perspectives. As such, this study addresses the following: What events do young participants view as scientific? To what extent do participant perceptions of authentic herpetology work align with what herpetologists actually do in the field? Eighteen children (aged 7–11) were observed in two informal herpetology programs, one program focused on field studies and the other on classroom participation and observation. Through photograph elicitation interviews, a method in which participants take photographs and describe them to others, participants were asked to photograph activities that made them feel ‘like scientists’ as they participated in each week-long program. Perceptions of authenticity were directly linked to program structure and did not always reflect the practices of working herpetologists. The evidence from this study indicated that the methodologies used and experiences provided in the Herpetology program offered participants experiences that not only built on their interests, but also engaged them in the practical and informative work of herpetologists in the field. In contrast, the Reptiles program limited participant perceptions of herpetology to a broad sense of studying the environment with limited opportunities to engage in herpetological fieldwork. © 2013 Taylor & Francis.","Authentic science; Herpetology; Informal; Photograph elicitation interview",,,,,,,,,,,"Allen, L., Young people's ‘agency' in sexuality research using visual methods (2008) Journal of Youth Studies, 11 (6), pp. 565-577; Allen, L., ‘Snapped': Researching the sexual culture of schools using visual methods (2009) International Journal of Qualitative Studies in Education, 22 (5), pp. 549-561; (2009) Benchmarks for scientific literacy, , New York, NY: Oxford University Press; Archer, L., Dewitt, J., Osborne, J., Dillon, J., Willis, B., Wong, B., ‘Doing’ science versus ‘Being’ a scientist: Examining 10/11-year-old children's constructions of science through the lens of identify (2010) Science Education, 94 (4), pp. 617-639; Bowen, G.M., Roth, W.M., The practice of field ecology: Insights for science education (2007) Research on Science Education, 37, pp. 171-187; Bronfenbrenner, U., (1979) The ecology of human development, , Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press; Brossard, D., Lewenstein, B., Bonney, R., Scientific knowledge and attitude change: The impact of a citizen science project (2005) International Journal of Science Education, 27 (9), pp. 1099-1121; Buxton, C., Creating contextually authentic science in a ‘low-performing’ urban elementary school (2006) Journal of Research in Science Teaching, 43 (7), pp. 695-721; Bybee, R., McCrae, B., Laurie, R., PISA 2006: An assessment of scientific literacy (2009) Journal of Research in Science Teaching, 46 (8), pp. 865-883; Cappello, M., Photo interviews: Eliciting data through conversations with children (2005) Field Methods, 17 (2), pp. 170-182; Carlone, H.B., Haun-Frank, J., Webb, A., Assessing equity beyond knowledge- and skills-based outcomes: A comparative ethnography of two fourth-grade reform-based science classrooms (2011) Journal of Research in Science Teaching, 48 (5), pp. 459-485; Carr, M., Being a learner: Five learning dispositions for early childhood (1999) Early Childhood Practice, 1 (1), pp. 82-99; Carr, M., Claxton, G., Tracking the development of learning dispositions (2002) Assessment in Education: Principles, Policy, & Practice, 9 (1), pp. 9-37; Charney, J., Hmelo-Silver, C.E., Sofer, W., Neigeborn, L., Coletta, S., Nemeroff, M., Cognitive apprenticeship in science through immersion in laboratory practices (2007) International Journal of Science Education, 29 (2), pp. 195-213; Clark-Ibáñez, M., Framing the social world with photo elicitation interviews (2004) American Behavioral Scientist, 47 (12), pp. 1507-1527; Epstein, I., Stevens, B., McKeever, P., Baruchel, S., Photo elicitation interview (PEI): Using photos to elicit children's perspectives (2006) International Journal of Qualitative Methods, 5 (3), pp. 1-9; Fields, D.A., What do students gain from a week at summer camp?

The purpose of this research was to determine if informal education institutions, such as science centres, could provide professional development that influences the science teaching self-efficacy beliefs of pre-service and in-service primary school teachers. A cohort of eight final-year pre-service teachers and 13 in-service teachers in Australia participated in this research over a period of 18 months. The results of this research showed that four hours of professional development workshops produced by science centres were capable of increasing the science teaching self-efficacy of all but three participants, with observable effects for at least 11 months after the completion of the workshops. The participants identified the workshops as a positive influence on their science teaching, and an important source of confidence and motivation. This project showed that the informal education sector can contribute to achieving positive reforms within science education, but only if the context in which teachers must operate is taken into account and reform efforts adapted accordingly. The informal science education sector could be the key to achieving long lasting reform in science education where other, formal measures have failed. Further studies are required to look at how places like science centres and museums can work with teacher educators, particularly in universities, to assist in the training of new teachers in science. © 2013 Taylor & Francis.","Informal education; Primary teachers; Science teaching; Self-efficacy beliefs",,,,,,,,,,,"Angus, M., Olney, H., Ainley, J., (2007) In the balance: The future of Australia's primary schools, , Canberra: Australian Primary Principals Association; Angus, M., Olney, H., Ainley, J., Caldwell, B., Burke, G., Selleck, R., Spinks, J., (2004) The sufficiency of resources for Australian primary schools, , http://www.dest.gov.au/sectors/school_education/publications_resources/profiles/sufficiency_resources_primary_schools.htm, Retrieved from; Aubusson, P., Griffin, J., Sawle, G., Vassila, H., Primary science and technology teachers’ professional learning preferences.

The results indicate that biotechnology courses that have yet to integrate this training into their curriculum may require significant support for its delivery. In particular, lecturers will need to reprioritise science communication, suitable teaching materials will need to be developed, and space will need to be found in a curriculum that is already perceived to be overcrowded. © 2013 Taylor & Francis.","Biotechnology education; Public engagement; Science communication",,,,,,,"For the students who enter into research positions, this training may be invaluable when they are required to apply to public granting bodies for research funding. Since 1997, the National Science Foundation in the USA has required scientists to detail in research grant applications the broad societal impact of their research. In the UK, the Research Council requires scientists to provide impact summaries and pathways that demonstrate the contribution of the research to society and in Australia, the Australian Research Council is currently developing a framework for impact reporting. While these granting requirements have been criticised for being an ‘add on’ to grants (Bozeman & Boardman, 2009) and requiring scientists to be experts in both their field and the area of research impact (Burggren, 2009), they have also been commended for providing an opportunity for scientists and society to engage in mutual education (Frodeman & Holbrook, 2007).

The ‘scale of attitude toward pseudoscience’ instrument was used to measure the attitudes of 380 Taiwanese university students who served as subjects for the study. The data were analyzed using hierarchical multiple regression for quantitative analysis. The results showed exposure to pseudoscientific TV programmes was the predictive factor for pseudoscientific beliefs among university students. Non-science students expressed more favorable attitudes toward pseudoscientific beliefs than science students. Majoring in science had a moderating effect on the relationship between exposure to pseudoscientific TV programmes and pseudoscientific beliefs. Finally, some suggestions are proposed for how future scientific instruction could counteract pseudoscientific beliefs among students. © 2013 Taylor & Francis.","Majoring in science; Paranormal; Pseudoscience; Scientific literacy; Television exposure",,,,,,"National Science Council, NSC","The work reported here was supported by Taiwan’s National Science Council under grant No. NSC 99-2511-S-110-007-MY2.

Using cross-setting ethnographic fieldwork (i.e. home, museum, school, community), we developed an ecologically grounded interview protocol and analytical scheme for gauging students' understandings of and identification with science. Focal participants in an ethnographic study rated the frequency of the activities in which they participated, and then they reflected on how these activities connected to scientific knowledge, practices, and tools through an interview task protocol called the Science Activity Task (SAT). The SAT analysis found that children participated in scientific practices and saw science in their home, media, and community activities as well as in school activities. Children participated in scientific practices in their everyday school activities, such as measuring, building and designing, experimenting, and observing. The analysis also identified design principles such as building science activities from the children's pre-existing connections to science (i.e. mixing things together, conducting informal experiments, and understanding electrical devices) rather than traditional home−school connections (i.e. the children did not see science in building with Legos® or in the physics behind sports). The study's primary implication is that researchers and educators should seek to understand the specific connection that the young people they are working with have with science, using tools such as SAT, so that informal and formal science curricula are made relevant and meaningful to the youth participants. © 2013 Taylor & Francis.","Elementary education; Formal−informal links; Informal education; Middle-school education; Nature of science; Qualitative research; Science education",,,,,,"National Science Foundation, NSF: –0354453","We gratefully acknowledge the intellectual influence of our colleagues in the LIFE Center and wish to thank the National Science Foundation for their support and for the opportunity (award #SBE–0354453).

The sample consisted of 251 students. The age range of the students varied from 11 to 14. The attitude scale was administered before, immediately after, and one week after a visit to METU SC. Because of the limitations on sampling procedure, two different research designs were used. Design 1 was a quasi-experimental design and arranged to determine the impact of METU SC on sixth graders' attitudes towards science with respect to the six constructs of the attitude scale, namely ‘Learning science in school’, ‘Self-concept in school science’, ‘Practical work in school science’, ‘Science outside of school’, ‘Future participation in science’, and ‘Importance of science’. Design 2 was a weak experimental design and arranged to determine the impact of METU SC on students' overall attitudes towards science with respect to their gender, grade levels, and science achievement levels. The results of this study suggest that science centres might have high potential on increasing students' attitudes towards science in all dimensions of the attitude scale, except for ‘Practical work in school science’. Furthermore, this increase is independent of gender, science achievement, and grade levels. Also, considering that this achievement was accomplished in quite a short time, science centres can be used by educators as an effective way of increasing students' attitudes towards science. © 2013 Taylor & Francis.","Attitude towards science; Gender; Grade level; Science achievement; Science centres",,,,,,,,,,,"Anderson, D., Lucas, K.B., Ginns, I.S., Dierking, L.D., Development of knowledge about electricity and magnetism during a visit to a science museum and related post-visit activities (2000) Science Education, 84, pp. 658-679; ASTC) (n.d.).

Data were collected on 1,580 students from eight middle schools in five states, applying an accelerated longitudinal design. Two consecutive cohorts were sampled over a two-year period time. Logistic regression analysis was used to examine the relationship between students' participation in science summer camps and their career interest in science and engineering while initial career interest and background information were considered. Results indicate that students who participated in science summer camps before or in the first year of the study, compared to students who did not, are significantly more likely to report science and engineering as their future career field in the second year of the study.

The design was based on three areas of interest: (a) the story as a tool for learning; (b) the student as subjects engaging with the story; and (c) the context in which the story learning activity takes place. In this study, students were engaged in a themed exhibit about human and animal senses at a public science centre. A story was created to support students’ engagement and interaction with the themed exhibit. The story was specially designed to provide opportunities for designing and conducting inquiry-based investigations in pre- and post-activities at school and at the science centre. Seven classes (20–25 students each) from third to sixth grade participated in the study. Four classes where fourth graders. Grades 3, 5, and 6 were each represented by one class. Data were collected through observations, teacher and student interviews, lesson plans, and assignments in a period of six months. The analysis of the data showed that three parameters influenced the use of the story: (a) the ways in which teachers used the story; (b) students’ and teachers’ understanding of the story-based learning activities; and (c) structural and design components of the story. These findings illustrate the value of stories, as learning tools, in science education and have implications for story-based learning designs in formal and informal learning environments. © 2013 Taylor & Francis.","Case Study; Formal–Informal Links; Science Centre",,,,,,,,,,,"Aikenhead, G.S., Ogawa, M., Indigenous knowledge and science revisited (2007) Cultural Studies of Science Education, 2, pp. 539-620; A national declaration for education 2001 (2001) Unicorn, 27 (2), pp. 3-26; Avraamidou, L., Osborne, J., The role of narrative in communicating science (2009) International Journal of Science Education, 31 (12), pp. 1683-1707; Barnett, J., Hodson, D., Pedagogical context knowledge: Toward a fuller understanding of what good science teachers know (2001) Science Education, 85 (4), pp. 426-453; Braun, V., Clarke, V., Using thematic analysis in psychology (2006) Qualitative Research in Psychology, 3 (2), pp. 77-101; Broström, S., Ritchie, T., Virksomhedsteori: Perspektiver på relationer (2005) Relationer i psykologien, pp. 203-229. , København, Billesøe & Baltser; Bruner, J., (1986) Actual minds possible worlds, , Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press; Bruner, J.S., (1996) The culture of education, , Cambridge, MA/London: Harvard University Press; Chatman, S., (1978) Story and discourse: Narrative structure in fiction and film, , Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press; Conle, C., An anatomy of narrative curricula (2003) Educational Researcher, 32 (3), pp. 3-15; Creswell, J.W., (2007) Qualitative inquiry and research design: Choosing among five approaches, , Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage; Duschl, R.A., Schweingruber, A., Shouse, A.W., (2007) Taking science to school: Learning and teaching science in grades K-8, , Washington, DC: The National Academy Press; Gallagher, J.J., Prospective and practicing secondary school science teachers’ knowledge and beliefs about the philosophy of science (1991) Science Education, 75 (1), pp. 121-133; Gauld, C., The scientific attitude and science education: A critical reappraisal (1982) Science Education, 66 (1), pp. 109-121; Graesser, A.C., Olde, B., Klettke, B., How does the mind construct and represent stories (2002) Narrative impact: Social and cognitive foundations, pp. 229-262. , Green M.C., Strange J.J., Brock T.C., (eds), Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, &,.

In this Position paper, general proposals are made for the levels of understanding of nano that might be attained by whole populations. The ideas that should be addressed in those levels of understanding are reviewed. The scope and limitations of formal and informal avenues to the attainment of such understanding are outlined. Proposals are made for the aspects of nano that are best conveyed by the different media available for informal provision and illustrated from the scant documentation of contemporary practice.

However, there is a limited number of studies that focus on the way teachers' beliefs influence their practices in an informal science-learning venue. This research aimed to investigate teachers' practices, when they plan, implement and comment upon the outcomes of a school visit to a science and technology museum in relation to their beliefs regarding the value of informal education, ways of supporting learning in an informal science-learning venue and the importance of familiarity with the venue. We studied 14 primary and secondary education teachers with respect to a visit they conducted with their class to a science and technology museum within a case-study approach. Interviews with the teachers, both prior to and after the school visits, and observations of the field trips were used to collect and verify our data. We applied a mixed analytical process, both inductive and deductive, to reveal different relations between teachers' beliefs and practices. Results show that there are close links between teachers' beliefs regarding the value of informal education and the learning processes within informal settings that influence their goals, roles and actions before, during and after the school visit. These results are discussed in light of teachers' need for in-service education regarding informal science education. © 2013, Copyright Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Informal science education; Science and technology museums; Teachers' beliefs; Teachers' practices",,,,,,,,,,,"Abell, S.K., Roth, M., Reflections on a fifth-grade life science lesson: Making sense of children's understanding of scientific models (1995) International Journal of Science Education, 17, pp. 59-74. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/0950069950170105; Anderson, D., Kisiel, J., Storksdieck, M., Understanding teachers’ perspectives on field trips (2006) Curator, 49 (3), pp. 365-386. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.2151-6952.2006.tb00229.x; Anderson, D., Zhang, Z., Teacher perceptions of field-trip planning and implementation (2003) Visitor Studies Today, 6 (3), pp. 6-11; Appleton, K., Asoko, H., A case study of teachers’ progress toward using a constructivist view of learning to inform teaching in elementary science (1996) Science Education, 80, pp. 165-180. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/(SICI)1098-237X(199604)80:2<165::AID-SCE3>3.0.CO;2-E; Bell, R., Blair, M., Crawford, B., Lederman, N., Just do it?

Participants included undergraduate students (n = 132) enrolled in a microbiology course at two universities and one community college. Students completed a survey at the beginning and end of the course and a sub-sample of students also participated in pre- and post-course interviews. The survey results showed that there were changes in students’ knowledge of microbes and microbial transmission as well as changes in reported behaviors related to microbial transmission. The behavior changes primarily involved perceptions of microbial transmission via touch such as using a public telephone, touching a faucet in a public bathroom, handling money, borrowing soap from a friend while camping, working in the dirt without gloves, and taking out the trash. There were no differences in behaviors related to oral transmission (eating, drinking, and kissing) or for preventative behavior (use of sanitizing items or frequency of hand washing). Exploratory factor analysis showed a subtle shift in the conceptualization of transmission risks from pre- to post-course. Pre- and post-interviews revealed that although students gained a more sophisticated concept of the positive role of microbes in the ecosystem, they were not more likely to report changing their behaviors related to vaccines to avoid getting sick from pathogenic microbes. © 2013, Copyright Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Health education; Personal constructivism; Scientific literacy",,,,,,,,,,,"Allum, N., Sturgis, P., Tabourazi, D., Bruton-Smith, I., Science knowledge and attitudes across cultures: A meta-analysis (2008) Public Understanding of Science, 17, pp. 35-54. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0963662506070159; Boyer, T.W., The development of risk-taking: A multi-perspective review (2006) Developmental Review, 26, pp. 291-345. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.dr.2006.05.002; Byrne, J., Models of micro-organisms: Children's knowledge and understanding of micro-organisms from 7 to 14 years old (2011) International Journal of Science Education, 33 (14), pp. 1927-1961. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09500693.2010.536999; Byrne, J., Grace, M., Using a concept mapping tool with a photograph association technique (CoMPAT) to elicit children's ideas about microbial activity (2010) International Journal of Science Education, 32 (4), pp. 479-500. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09500690802688071; Christensen, C., Risk and school science education (2009) Studies in Science Education, 45 (2), pp. 205-223. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03057260903142293; Davey, G.C.L., Forster, L., Mayhew, G., Familial resemblances in disgust sensitivity and animal phobias (1993) Behaviour Research and Therapy, 31, pp. 41-50. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0005-7967(93)90041-R; Deacon, B., Olatunji, B.O., Specificity of disgust sensitivity in the prediction of behavioral avoidance in contamination fear (2007) Behaviour Research and Therapy, 45, pp. 2110-2120. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.brat.2007.03.008; Gardner, G.E., Jones, M.G., Science instructors' perceptions of the risks of biotechnology: Implications for science instruction (2011) Research in Science Education, 41 (5), pp. 711-738; Gstraunthaler, T., Day, R., Avian influenza in the UK: Knowledge, risk perception and risk reduction strategies (2008) British Food Journal, 110 (3), pp. 260-270. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/00070700810858673; Hallberg, L.R., The ‘core category’ of grounded theory: Making constant comparisons (2006) International Journal of Qualitative Studies on Health and Well-being, 1 (3), pp. 141-148. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/17482620600858399; Janahi, E., Awadh, M., Awadh, S., Public knowledge, risk perception, attitudes and practices in relation to the swine flu pandemic: A cross sectional questionnaire-based survey in Bahrain (2011) International Journal of Collaborative Research on Internal Medicine and Public Health, 3 (6), pp. 451-464; Johnson, B., Advancing understanding of knowledge's role in lay risk perception (1993) Risk: Issues and Health and Safety, 4, pp. 189-212; Jones, M.G., Rua, M.J., Conceptions of germs: Expert to novice understandings of microorganisms (2006) Electronic Journal of Science Education, 10 (3); Jones, M.G., Rua, M.J., Conceptual representations of flu and microbial illness held by students, teachers, and medical professionals (2008) School Science and Mathematics, 108 (6), pp. 263-278; Kolsto, S., Patterns in students’ argumentation confronted with a risk-focused socio-scientific issue (2006) International Journal of Science Education, 28 (14), pp. 1689-1716. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09500690600560878; Lundstrom, M., (2011) Decision-making in health issues: Teenagers’ use of science and other discourses (Doctoral dissertation), , http://dspace.mah.se/handle/2043/12460, Retrieved from; Marks, R., Eilks, I., Promoting scientific literacy using a sociocritical and problem-oriented approach to chemistry teaching: Concept, examples, experiences (2009) International Journal of Environmental & Science Education, 4 (3), pp. 231-245; (1996) National science education standards, , Washington, DC: National Academy Press; O'Connor, M.K., Netting, F.E., Thomas, M.L., Grounded theory: Managing the challenge for those facing institutional review board oversight (2008) Qualitative Inquiry, 14 (1), pp. 28-45. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1077800407308907; Olatunji, B.O., Sawchuk, C.N., Lohr, J.M., de Jong, P.J., Disgust domains in the prediction of contamination fear (2004) Behaviour Research and Therapy, 42, pp. 93-104. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0005-7967(03)00102-5; Queensland Curriculum, Assessment and Reporting Framework, , http://www.qsa.qld.edu.au, Queensland Studies Authority.

At the most basic level, this entails accounting for the performance of individual exhibits, and indeed, in some cases, research indicates shortcomings in exhibit design: While often successful in prompting visitors to carry out intended actions, exhibits do not necessarily promote the intended interpretations of these actions among visitors. Here, the notion of praxeology from didactics research is suggested as a model to remedy this shortcoming. The suggested role of praxeology is twofold: as a means to operationalize the link between exhibit features and visitor activities; and as a template to transform scientists’ practices in the research context into visitors’ activities in the exhibit context. The resulting model of science exhibit engineering is presented and exemplified, and its implications for science exhibit design are discussed at three levels: the design product, the design process, and the design methodology. © 2013, Copyright Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Exhibit design; Informal education; Museum; Praxeology",,,,,,,,,,,"Afonso, A.F., Gilbert, J.K., Educational value of different types of exhibits in an interactive science and technology center (2007) Science Education, 91, pp. 967-987. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/sce.20220; Allen, S., Designs for learning: Studying science museum exhibits that do more than entertain (2004) Science Education, 88. , S17–S33; Anderson, D., Lucas, K.B., Ginns, I.S., Dierking, L.D., Development of knowledge about electricity and magnetism during a visit to a science museum and related post-visit activities (2000) Science Education, 84, pp. 658-679. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/1098-237X(200009)84:5<658::AID-SCE6>3.0.CO;2-A; Artigue, M., Didactical design in mathematics education (2009) Nordic research in mathematics education.

We used social network analysis and qualitative methods to reveal characteristics of the informal science curriculum support network reported by a cohort of 13 teachers in an urban district. Access to materials for instruction was found to be a central factor in shaping networking and instructional practices. Alice, a university partner, emerged as a central figure in the network. She helped to distribute valuable resources and support. We describe how Alice's work with the school community fostered her key role in the teachers' networks. The findings have implications for researchers and practitioners for understanding and implementing science curriculum reform and university partnership programs. © 2013, Copyright Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","School/univ; Science communication; Teacher development",,,,,,,,,,,"Atteberry, A., Bryk, A.S., Centrality, connection, and commitment: The role of social networks in a school-based literacy initiative (2010) Social network theory and educational change, pp. 51-76. , Daly A., (ed), Cambridge, MA: Harvard Education Press, and, In, Edited by; Baker-Doyle, K.J., (2011) The networked teacher: How new teachers build social networks for professional support, , New York: Teachers College Press; Baker-Doyle, K.J., Yoon, S.A., In search of practitioner-based social capital: A social network analysis tool for understanding and facilitating teacher collaboration in a professional development program (2010) Professional Development in Education, 37 (1), pp. 75-93. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/19415257.2010.494450; Baker-Doyle, K.J., Yoon, S.A., Making expertise transparent: Using technology to strengthen social networks in Teacher Professional Development (2010) Social network theory and educational change, pp. 115-127. , Daly A.J., (ed), Cambridge, MA: Harvard Education Press, and, In, Edited by; Bidwell, C., Yasumoto, J.Y., The collegial focus: Teaching fields, collegial relationships, and instructional practice in American high schools (1999) Sociology of Education, 72 (4), pp. 234-256. , http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/2673155; Borgatti, S.P., Everett, M.G., Freeman, L.C., (2002) UCINET for windows: Software for social network analysis, , Harvard, MA: Analytic Technologies, and; Borgatti, S.P., Foster, P.C., The network paradigm in organizational research: A review and typology (2003) Journal of Management, 29 (6), pp. 991-1013; Burt, R.S., (1992) Structural holes: The social structure of competition, , Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press; Coburn, C., Collective sensemaking about reading: How teachers mediate reading policy in their professional communities (2001) Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis, 23 (2), pp. 145-170. , http://dx.doi.org/10.3102/01623737023002145; Coburn, C., Choi, L., Mata, W., ‘I would go to her because her mind is math’: Network formation in the context of a district-based mathematical reform (2010) Social network theory and educational change, pp. 33-50. , Daly A., (ed), Cambridge, MA: Harvard Education Press, and, In, Edited by; Cole, R.P., Weinbaum, E.H., Changes in attitude: Peer influence in high school reform (2010) Social network theory and educational change, pp. 77-96. , Daly A., (ed), Cambridge, MA: Harvard Education Press, and, In, Edited by; Daly, A.J., Moolenaar, N., Bolivar, J., Burke, P., Relationships in reform: The role of teachers’ social networks (2010) Journal of Educational Administration, 48 (3), pp. 20-49. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/09578231011041062; Feiman-Nemser, S., Parker, M.B., Mentoring in context: A comparison of two U.S. programs for beginning teachers (1993) International Journal of Educational Research, 19 (8), pp. 699-718. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0883-0355(93)90010-H; Feiman-Nemser, S., Schwille, S., Carver, C., Yusko, B., (1999) A conceptual review of literature on new teacher induction (No. ED449147), , Washington, DC: National Partnership for Excellence and Accountability in Teaching; Frank, K.A., Zhao, Y., Borman, K., Social capital and the diffusion of innovations within organizations: The case of computer technology in schools (2004) Sociology of Education, 77 (April), pp. 148-171. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/003804070407700203; Garet, M.S., Porter, A.C., Desimone, L., Birman, B.F., Yoon, K.S., What makes professional development effective?

Key elements of the model are Youth Leadership Teams that guide the program design and assist with implementation; a speaker preparation process to help scientists better connect with the teen audience; and a highly interactive program that goes beyond the typical short presentation and lively discussion by incorporating other means to actively explore the topic of the event. Our objectives in offering the program are to make science and scientists more engaging and accessible to youth; to help youth see science and technology research and discoveries as relevant to their daily lives; and to encourage positive attitudes toward science, scientists, and science, technology, engineering, and math careers. As a result of this project, we expected youth would develop:• an informal community that engages in scientific discourse, thought, and exploration;• a deep and nuanced understanding of current issues in science and technology and be able to communicate that understanding confidently and expertly;• skills and attitudes for lifelong learning and an appreciation of science as a career and as a way of thinking. The summative evaluation used a quasi-experimental design with matched control-treatment groups (N = 383) to study the impact of the program on (1) attitudes toward science, scientists, and science careers and (2) Positive Youth Development (PYD). The evaluation data demonstrated the program positively impacted participants' science-related attitudes; however, the degree to which the program's PYD outcomes were achieved is less conclusive. © 2013, Copyright Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Cafe Scientifique; Out-of-school program; Positive youth development; Science café; Science communication; STEM attitudes; Youth",,,,,,"National Science Foundation, NSF

During the past few decades, museums and science centres throughout the world have placed increasing emphasis on their educational function. Although exhibitions are the primary means of promoting visitors' learning, educational research is not often utilised when designing these learning environments. Rather, the development of exhibitions in museums and science centres tends to rely on the know-how of the staff. Reviewing and engaging in science education research would complement this expertise and support the educational role of science exhibitions. This theoretical paper therefore suggests such a research-based approach by adapting the model of educational reconstruction for the purpose of exhibition development following the idea of the model for the personal awareness of science and technology. The former model serves as a general framework to involve analytical and empirical research in the development of learning environments, while the latter model provides a specific view of visitors' learning in interaction with exhibits. This study shows how these constructivist models can be interconnected in order to apply educational research in improving the long-term learning profit of exhibition visits. The idea is illustrated with an example concerning the research-based development of a nanoscience exhibition. © 2013, Copyright Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Educational reconstruction; Exhibit design; Informal education; Learning environment; Personal awareness of science and technology",,,,,,"National Science Foundation, NSF","Lastly, the research-based groundwork for the exhibition involved a review of research findings on museum learning (Figure 3), but focusing on reports on previous nanoscience exhibitions. While several exhibitions on these topics have been launched in recent years in museums and science centres all over the world, only a few publications have reported the experiences of these projects from an educational viewpoint. When discussing the Brazilian NanoAventura exhibition, Murriello, Contier, and Knobel (2006) stressed that the most important museographic and communicational challenge in designing exhibits on nanoscience and nanotechnology relates to the fact that the fields are based on objects that are invisible to the naked eye. Exactly the same notion is also stated in an evaluation of It’s a nano world, a travelling exhibition funded by the National Science Foundation in the USA (Batt, Waldron, & Trautmann, 2004). While NanoAventura solved the dilemma of displaying nano-objects in an exhibition by using computer games and virtual representations, It’s a nano world employed concrete macroscopic models and analogies. For the exhibition brief, both types of exhibits were chosen. The literature review increased the understanding of the advantages and disadvantages of different museographic approaches, thereby making it possible to use the approaches deliberately.",,,,"Afonso, A., Gilbert, J., The use of memories in understanding interactive science and technology exhibits (2006) International Journal of Science Education, 28 (13), pp. 1523-1544. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09500690600768828;

This study investigated the effects of an HIV AIDS science theatre presentation on the behavioural intentions of 697 South African students, a population facing extreme HIV risk. Surveys measured 15 HIV-related intentions before and after the presentation. Significant changes occurred in 9 of 15 intentions including resisting peer-pressure, HIV learning, discussing HIV with family and sexual abstinence. Changes typically involved strengthening of already positive intentions. Regression modelling showed prior intention was the greatest single predictor of intention change, with poor prior intentions associated with greater change. Audience emotional responses of interest and enjoyment, prior knowledge and knowledge change regarding HIV risk, and self-reported learning also predicted intention change; higher scores were associated with greater change. These variables predicted more variation in intention change than prior intentions, suggesting emotional responses in particular, but also knowledge and learning, play an important role in influencing intentions. Demographic variables had no influence on intention change. These findings provide provisional evidence of the importance of the emotions of interest and enjoyment in informal science learning, especially where the aim is to motivate change. The study underscores the potential that science centres and other informal science learning providers have as advocates for positive societal change, even with difficult and contentious issues such as HIV AIDS. © 2013, Copyright Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Affective domain; Emotion; Health education; HIV AIDS; Intention; Science centre",,,,,,"Wellcome Trust, WT","The intervention described here was funded with a Wellcome Trust grant.

However, despite advanced screening and detection techniques, the disease all too frequently remains undetected until it has reached an advanced stage. Despite a number of means of disseminating breast cancer awareness, such as public health programs, public and private media and the internet, breast cancer remains a major health problem which exerts a tremendous economic burden on the health care system. Consequently, promoting early awareness of the disease to students at both high school and college levels might potentially lead to improved health habits later in life. This study investigated breast cancer awareness among college and high school students. A self-administered questionnaire was given to 355 high school students and 132 college students in a mid-western area of the USA to determine their perceptions of breast cancer, risk factors and the need for breast self-examination. Despite many annual efforts to disseminate breast cancer awareness and the availability of information about the disease, our study showed that both college and high school students have a poor understanding of breast cancer. Most participants, however, were receptive to the provision of more information at school. Based on our findings, we recommend more breast cancer awareness programs targeting high school and college students. Breast cancer awareness could be included as a component of the high school curriculum, as well as via the internet and public health programs. © 2013, Copyright Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Breast cancer knowledge; Breast self-examination; College and high school students; Risk factors",,,,,,,,,,,"Ahmed, B.A., Awareness and practice of breast and breast-self examination among university students in Yemen (2010) Asian Pacific Journal of Cancer Prevention, 11 (1), pp. 101-106; Ahmed, F., Mahmud, S., Hatcher, J., Khan, S.M., Breast cancer risk factor knowledge among nurses in teaching hospitals of Karachi, Pakistan: A cross-sectional study (2006) BioMed Central Nursing, 5, pp. 6-13. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1472-6955-5-6; Breast cancer facts and figur e s 2009–2010 (2010) Retrieved from, 2009. , http://www.cancer.org/research/cancerfactsfigures/breastcancerfactsfigures/breast-cancer-facts-figures--2010, American Cancer Society; Anders, C.K., Hsu, D.S., Broadwater, G., Acharya, C.R., Foekens, J.A., Zhang, Y., Wang, Y., Blackwell, K.L., Young age at diagnosis correlates with worse prognosis and defines a subset of breast cancers with shared patterns of gene expression (2008) Journal of Clinical Oncology, 26 (20), pp. 3324-3330. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1200/JCO.2007.14.2471; Bianchini, F., Overweight, obesity, and cancer risk.

The study focused on students’ and teachers’ behaviour during school-guided visits to an aquarium; students’ and teachers’ perspectives about this type of school visits; and the reasons provided by teachers to engage in a guided tour to a science museum. Direct observations of 39 guided tours were performed in order to describe the structure of the visit and the participants’ behaviour. A questionnaire was given to 145 teachers and 191 students after the visit, in order to describe their perspectives about the visit, and an online questionnaire was sent to a sample of 11 teachers, in order to understand their ideas about school visits to science museums. Data analysis showed that the guided visits, although well evaluated by both students and teachers, were mainly guide-directed and lecture-oriented, giving students and teachers very little choice and control over the learning agenda. Moreover, teachers showed a very passive role during the visit and reported limited plans for preparation and follow-up activities that would support the visit. Despite this scenario, the teachers who were questioned preferred guided visits to non-guided visits and recognized the potential of museums for learning. The possible role of teachers in establishing the necessary connection between guided tours and school science, and helping to bridge school curriculum, museum content, and student inquiries is discussed. © 2013, Copyright Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","field trips; Formal–informal links; Zoo",,,,,,"Instituto Nacional de CiÃªncia e Tecnologia para Excitotoxicidade e NeuroproteÃ§Ã£o, INCT-EN: SFRH/BPD/26939/2006","The author was supported by a grant from Fundac¸ão para a Ciência e a Tecnologia (SFRH/BPD/26939/2006).",,,,"Anderson, D., Lucas, K.B., Ginns, I.S., Theoretical perspectives on learning in an informal setting (2003) Journal of Research in Science Teaching, 40 (2), pp. 177-199. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/tea.10071; Bell, P., Lewenstein, B., Shouse, A.W., Feder, M.A., (2009) Learning science in informal environments: People, places and pursuits.

This paper describes the use of a modified Delphi technique to co-generate research questions for a collaborative research study co-funded by a university and a natural history museum. Nine staff from the Science and the Public Engagement groups took part in a process which involved an initial workshop followed by 2 email rounds of ranking potential research themes. The process enabled the museum staff to engage with the relevant literature and to share ideas and priorities for a doctoral research study. As a result, the modified Delphi technique is proposed as a tool for bridging research and practice, building on earlier discussions and research agendas in the field, to identify research themes of importance to practitioners and stakeholders and not only to scholars and academics. © 2013, Copyright Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Collaborative research; Museum; Public engagement; Research agendas",,,,,,,"The authors thank the participants in the panel for taking the time to contribute to this study and the reviewers for their helpful comments on the earlier draft of this paper.

The purpose of the case study was to monitor the public's perception of the severity of problems posed by invasive animal species and of possible methods of managing them. A real-time ‘moving picture’ of public opinion was developed over the lifetime of the study. Despite the modest weekly survey numbers, the results proved remarkably consistent in identifying cane toads, feral cats, rabbits, carp and feral pigs as the public's most disliked pests, in identifying preferred methods for controlling them, in finding differential demographic responses and detecting changing community priorities, and in providing an ongoing measure of the effectiveness of science communication. One important aspect of the study was to evaluate a recently developed technique for identifying and monitoring the key drivers of public perception of the value of the work of a research agency. The article demonstrates the feasibility of obtaining timely, reliable and actionable data that can be used to advance the uptake of new scientific research and assess the efficacy of science communication. It enables the user to monitor changes in the public's perception of the value of scientific research and link this to high-level business drivers such as their willingness to support the eventual deployment of a new technology. © 2013, Copyright Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Community value; Invasive species; Measuring science communication; Survey",,,,,,,"We are most grateful to Suzette Searle for very helpful information about the literature relating to science communication.

Box 80.000, Utrecht, TA  3508, Netherlands","Science communication has shifted considerably in Europe over the last decades. In the theoretical realm, one-way information has been replaced by models of science communication that stress public engagement and public participation in science and technology. Dialogue seems to have become a communication target on its own, beside such things as public understanding or awareness of science. This article articulates different notions of science communication and explores to what extent they can coexist in practice by presenting an empirical analysis of a public event on cancer genomics. The event brought together cancer patients, scientists and (para)medical professionals. Data on the intended and actual communication at the event were collected by document-based research, interviews, observation of communication processes and a written questionnaire. The results show that the event proved to be successful in terms of creating awareness and understanding of cancer genomics research and its implications for diagnosis and treatment of cancer. The results also illustrate that despite the intentions of those organising public communication activities, achieving the ideal of a two-way public dialogue in practice is not self-evident. This is partly due to a lack of commitment to societal issues at the institutional as well as the (inter)personal level. Drawing from our experiences and literature, we suggest that in science communication literature the role of dialogue moderators is underexposed. We argue that in doing and evaluating science communication, analytical attention should be focused on the interaction among the public(s) and invited experts and the opportunities for empowering both for decision-making in their everyday lives. © 2013, Copyright Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Cancer genomics; Public dialogue; Qualitative research; Science communication",,,,,,,"This article is the result of a research project of the Centre for Society and Genomics in The Netherlands, funded by the Netherlands Genomics Initiative.",,,,"Abma, T., Broerse, J., (2007) Zeggenschap in Wetenschap.

This paper identifies titles in the catalogues of some major publishers, the content of these books, the criteria that readers might use in judging their educational worth, and the value of these categories of books for promoting public engagement with chemistry. One hundred and ninety-three popular chemistry books, written in English and/or Portuguese, were identified in the catalogues of 80 major publishers. This identification and classification into themes were carried out by an analysis of synopses and introductions. In addition, an opportunity sample of 17 Portuguese undergraduate students, with no extensive backgrounds in science, was invited to produce a written evaluation of a book of their own choice. The producers of unusual or incisive evaluations (nine readers) were also interviewed. It was found that popular books can contribute to public engagement with chemistry when they have specific textual characteristics. There is a need for more books in Portuguese, and for more titles in specific fields, in order to broaden readers' perceptions of the cultural value of chemistry. © 2013, Copyright Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Chemical literacy; Science text comprehension; ‘Popular books’",,,,,,,,,,,"Apple in education, , http://www.apple.com/education/itunes-u, Apple.

Attempts to devise usable instruments that assess people's attitudes towards this innovation have been rare and non-systematic. The aim of this paper is to present the development and validation of the genetically modified organisms attitudes scale (GMOAS), an instrument measuring secondary school students' attitudes towards GMOs. The responses of 1,111 secondary school students from Cyprus were used to validate the instrument. Principal component analysis with varimax rotation revealed a clear three-factor solution explaining 45.8% of the total variance. The factors underlying the attitudes' construct are: GMO implications on health, Interest in the topic of GMOs, and GMO implications on the environment. The 16-item, five-point Likert-type GMOAS showed satisfactory internal consistency and discriminant validity. When the instrument was used to analyse data from Cyprus, results revealed that Cypriot secondary school students have rather non-supportive attitudes towards the cultivation and use of GMOs. Male students were less negative in using GMOs for health and environmental purposes than females. Females, however, were found to be more interested in learning about GMOs. These findings comply with the rather country-specific nature of GMO attitudes. © 2012, Copyright Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Assessment; Attitudes; Biotechnology education; GMOs",,,,,,,,,,,"Ajzen, I., (2005) Attitudes, personality and behaviour, , England: Open University Press;

Using focus groups, we sought to find out if and how the episode influenced our 34 participants’ perceptions of science, but our results problematised the very notion of influence. People's responses to the science in the episode varied widely, and sometimes in contradictory ways, from some participants seeing no science at all in the episode to others seeing science as the ideological focus of the entire story. Participants’ discussions were shaped and influenced by a myriad of factors, including their relationship to science and their personal and religious beliefs, but also historical discourses, political discourses, experiences watching other television programmes and other factors. We draw on the work of Roman Ingarden to suggest that people fill in or ‘concretise’ the ambiguities and gaps in a fiction text in ways specific to their personal, social, geographical and temporal context, resulting in different interpretations of the text's meaning with each fresh viewing. We conclude that a deficit model which assumes that people absorb fiction's content in a linear, passive and credulous manner is an inappropriate characterisation of how people process the science in fiction. © 2012, Copyright Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Concretisation; Deficit model; Science communication teaching; Science-based fiction; Television",,,,,,,,,,,"Barnett, M., Wagner, H., Gatling, A., Anderson, J., Houle, M., Kafka, A., The impact of science fiction film on student understanding of science (2006) Journal of Science Education and Technology, 15 (2), pp. 179-191. , and; Barriga, C.A., Shapiro, M.A., Fernandez, M.L., Science information in fictional movies: Effects of context and gender (2010) Science Communication, 32 (1), pp. 3-24. , and; Bates, B.R., Public culture and public understanding of genetics: A focus group study (2005) Public Understanding of Science, 14, pp. 47-65; Bixler, A., Teaching evolution with the aid of science fiction (2007) The American Biology Teacher, 69 (6), pp. 337-339. , [337:TEWTAO]2.0.CO;2; Brewer, P.R., Ley, B.L., Media use and public perceptions of DNA evidence (2010) Science Communication, 32 (1), pp. 93-117. , and; Brodie, M., Foehr, U., Rideout, V., Baer, N., Miller, C., Flournoy, R., Altman, D., Communicating health information through the entertainment media (2001) Health Affairs, 20 (1), pp. 192-199. , and; Byrd-Bredbenner, C., An internationally shared health frame of reference created by a television program: The Simpsons, a content analysis of health messages (2004) Health Education, 104 (1), pp. 18-24; The Simpsons, , Cohen, D.X.

To help prepare young people to engage with science in the media, teachers are being exhorted to equip their students with the knowledge, skills, and attitudes to respond critically to science-related news reports. Typically, such reports comprise not only text, but also visual elements. These images are not simply adjuncts to the written word; they are integral to meaning-making. Though science teachers make considerable use of newspaper images, they tend to view these representations unproblematically, underestimating their potential ambiguity, complexity, and role in framing media messages. They rarely aim to develop students' ability to ‘read’, critically, such graphics. Moreover, research into how this might be achieved is limited and, consequently, research-informed guidance which could support this instruction is lacking. This paper describes a study designed to formulate a framework for such teaching. Science communication scholars, science journalists and media educators with acknowledged relevant expertise were surveyed to ascertain what knowledge, skills, and attitudes they deemed useful to engagement with science-related news images. Their proposals were recast as learning intentions (instructional objectives), and science and English teachers collaborated to suggest which could be addressed with secondary school students and the age group best suited to their introduction. The outcome is an inventory of learning intentions on which teachers could draw to support their planning of instructional sequences aimed at developing students' criticality in respect of the totality of science news reports. © 2012, Copyright Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Informal education; Media; News; Science communication; Scientific literacy; Visualisation",,,,,,"Wellcome Trust, WT","The research described in this paper was funded by the Wellcome Trust.

Interviews were conducted and survey data were quantitatively analyzed by means of stepwise multiple regressions and reported with the use of cross tables. Results revealed exposure to pseudoscientific TV programs as a strong predictor of Taiwanese citizens' pseudoscientific beliefs and that younger citizens demonstrate more pseudoscientific beliefs and practices than older citizens.

This study examines the association between OST science activities and STEM career interest in university through a logistic regression model and the calculation of prototypical odds ratios. The analysis addresses two main research questions: What is the correlation among different forms of OST activities? And, controlling for student demographic and background variables, what specific forms of OST activities are associated with STEM career interest in university? The study uses data from the ‘Persistence Research in Science and Engineering’ survey (n = 6882), which employs a nationally representative sample of university students enrolled in introductory English courses. Results indicate that students’ participation in OST activities, as well as their middle school interest in science and mathematics and their gender, plays a significant role in university career interest in STEM. Conclusions suggest that making OST clubs and competitions and the inclusion of non-fiction and science fiction within English Language Arts programmes may be beneficial to the development of students in STEM careers. Limitations include the paucity of research examining which students participate in these activities and what specific features or characteristics benefit them. © 2012, Copyright Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Career; Interest; Mathematics; Out-of-school time; Science; STEM",,,,,,"National Science Foundation, NSF

Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory, SAO","The data used in this study were collected as part of the ‘Persistence Research in Science and Engineering’ (PRiSE) project, a mixed-method study funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF REC #062444) and conducted at the Science Education Department of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics. This survey contained 50 questions on multiple topics such as middle school science experiences, high school background information, high school science classes, science-related interests and attitudes, and career plan development. Independent reliability and validity analyses were performed to establish confidence in the robustness of the PRiSE survey from a test–retest design. Test–retest reliability of the survey was established by administering the survey to 96 students twice, in an interval of about two weeks. For continuous variables, the correlation coefficient between the test and retest answers served as a measure of reliability; for dichotomous variables, Cohen’s kappa was used. By combining these two analogous measures (for both of which 1 indicates perfect agreement), the overall mean test – retest reliability of the survey was determined to be 0.67.

A Delphi methodology provided a framework for a research design that accessed their opinions and allowed them to contribute to, reflect on and identify 10 essential elements. There was a high level of agreement among these experts that the audience comes first, and their statements signalled the importance of developing empathetic skills to engage an audience. Science communication courses should focus on the audience and how to access their needs, priorities and imagination. They signalled a need for dedicated science communication courses where students need to develop a broad understanding of the scientific and social issues rather than narrowly focusing on technical media skills development. © 2012, Copyright Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Audience empowerment; Educating science communicators; Interactive communication",,,,,,,,,,,"Abd-El-Khalick, F., Lederman, N.G., Improving science teachers' conceptions of nature of science: A critical review of the literature (2000) International Journal of Science Education, 22 (7), pp. 665-701; Bauer, M.W., Paradigm change for science communication: Commercial science needs a critical public (2008) Communicating science in social contexts, pp. 7-25. , Cheng D., Claessens M., Gascoigne T., Metcalfe J., Schiele B., Shi S., (eds), Dordrecht, The Netherlands: Springer, In, Edited by; Bubela, T., Nisbet, M.C., Borchelt, R., Brunger, F., Critchley, C., Einsiedel, E., Caulfield, T., Science communication reconsidered (2009) Nature Biotechnology, 27 (6), pp. 514-518; Craig, R.T., Communication theory as a field (1999) Communication Theory, 9 (2), pp. 119-161; Dalkey, N.C., Helmer, O., (1962) An experimental application of the Delphi method to the use of experts, , Santa Monica, CA: The RAND Corporation, and; Entman, R.M., Framing: Toward clarification of a fractured paradigm (1993) Journal of Communication, 43 (4), pp. 51-58; Goffman, E., (1974) Frame analysis: An essay on the organisation of experience, , New York, NY: Harper and Row; Gross, A.G., The roles of rhetoric in the public understanding of science (1994) Public Understanding of Science, 3 (1), pp. 3-23; Mulder, H.A.J., Longnecker, N., Davis, L.S., The state of science communication programs at universities around the world (2008) Science Communication, 30 (2), pp. 277-287; Murry, J.W., Hammons, J.O., Delphi—a versatile methodology for conducting qualitative research (1995) Review of Higher Education, 18 (4), pp. 423-436; Nisbet, M.C., Scheufele, D.A., What's next for science communication?

A theoretical model is constructed and evaluated to identify factors that affect public attitudes. Differences in citizens' gender, age, and educational level are also examined to determine whether they parallel differences found in their attitudes. Citizens were selected using probability proportional to size (PPS) sampling. A total of 2,024 valid questionnaires were collected and analyzed by structural equation modeling. The results showed that citizens' scientific knowledge promotes positive attitudes toward techno-scientific issues, which are reflected in their high level of support for scientific development, research and application, as well as recognition of global warming and impression of scientists. Additionally, citizens of different genders, ages, and educational levels have significant differences in their attitudes toward science and technology. Implications for formal and informal science education are discussed. © 2012, Copyright Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Attitudes; Quantitative research; Scientific literacy",,,,,,"National Science Council, NSC","The work reported here was supported by Taiwan’s National Science Council under grant No. NSC99-2511-S-017-001.

Since the late 1980s, however, regular public surveys have been conducted to find out what facts about science the public knows. These include such questions as whether the Earth goes round the Sun, which is frequently quoted as an indication of public knowledge. The results of the surveys have been used as comparative measures of public understanding across time and across countries since their inception. Concurrently, however, there have been questions raised in the literature about the validity and meaning of these surveys. In this paper we review that literature. We also describe the results of administering the survey to over 500 scientists. The scientists found the questions problematic, especially if the topic of the question lay within their own discipline, and in many cases did not remember the correct answer. We discuss the implications of the findings for using such questions in public surveys and recommend that current assessments of public knowledge which use these questions be revised, recognising that such measures are not meaningful as indicators of public engagement with science. © 2012, Copyright Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Informal education; Public; Survey",,,,,,"National Science Foundation, NSF","Bauer (2009), in a comprehensive review of the changing view of public understanding of science, pointed out that the concept of science literacy includes knowledge of basic textbook facts of science, understanding scientific methods, appreciation of the positive outcomes of science and technology for science and the rejection of superstitious beliefs. ‘This became the basis of the bi-annual science indicator surveys of the US National Science Foundation (NSF) from the late 1970s’ (p. 223). He added, however, that: ‘Countries have different science bases, and literacy reflects these science bases’ (p. 223).

Reporting on 33 semi-structured interviews, we focus on their views of participation and engagement in terms of motivations, expectations and expertise.

The aim of the study was to examine these young people’s ‘accounts of scientific knowledge’ in this context. Seven groups of friends responded to the news report, initially in focus group discussions. Later in semi-structured interviews they elaborated their understanding of the nature of science through their explanations of the scientists’ disagreement and described their mobile phone safety risk assessments. This paper presents their accounts in terms of their views of the nature of science and their concept understanding. Discussions were audio-recorded then analysed by coding the talk in terms of issues raised, which were grouped into themes and interpreted in terms of a moderate social constructionist theoretical framing. In this context, most participants expressed a ‘common sense’ view of the nature of science, describing it as an atheoretical, technical procedure of scientists testing their personal opinions on the issue, subject to the influence of funding sponsors. The roles of theory and data interpretation were largely ignored. It is argued that the nature of science understanding is crucial to engagement with contemporary socioscientific issues, particularly the roles of argumentation, theory, data interpretation, and the distinction of science from common sense. Implications for school science relate primarily to nature of science teaching and the inclusion of socioscientific issues in school science curricula.

Although usually grouped together under the umbrella term ‘Science Festivals’, the events differ greatly in size and scope. This paper presents the findings from a 2008/09 international survey of Science Festivals in order to compare and contrast worldwide trends. An online survey was completed by 56 self-identified Science Festivals, supplemented by a content analysis of 94 Festival websites identified internationally. This work identifies for the first time a common international definition for events which identify themselves as ‘Science Festivals’. The findings show that Science Festivals are currently particularly common within Europe; however, their popularity is growing within other regions. There is a large diversity in the scale of Science Festivals, encompassing some small, localised events reaching a few hundred people, up to nationwide events reaching many millions. Precise audience figures are not acquired by many Festivals; however, there is evidence that over 5.6 million people are reached by Science Festivals annually, with events focused mainly on hands-on activities combined with some talks, lectures, discussions, and debates. The funding and operational modes also vary significantly, with the vast majority of Science Festivals obtaining their funding from multiple sources, including government support, sponsorship, and funding grants. A considerable number of Science Festivals conduct at least an informal evaluation, with some Festivals making their evaluations publicly available. This work demonstrates that Science Festivals are an increasingly important area of science communication worthy of further research. © 2011, Copyright Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Celebration of science; Evaluation; International comparison; Science Festival",,,,,,,,,,,"Bauer, M.W., The evolution of public understanding of science discourse and comparative evidence (2009) Science Technology Society, 14, pp. 221-240; Bell, P., Lewenstein, B., Shouse, A.W., Feder, M.A., (2009) Learning science in informal environments: People, places, and pursuits, , Washington, DC: National Academy Press, and, eds; (2008) Festivals mean business 3, , http://www.efa-aef.eu/newpublic/upload/efadoc/11/Festival_UK_Survey.pdf, Retrieved from; Brito, F., Experimenting mediation: A constant challenge (2008) JCom, 7 (4), pp. 1-5; Burns, T.W., O’Connor, D.J., Stocklmayer, S.M., Science communication: A contemporary definition (2003) Public Understanding of Science, 12, pp. 183-202; Cassidy, A., Evolutionary psychology as public science and boundary work (2006) Public Understanding of Science, 15, pp. 175-205; Cohen, L., Manion, L., (1994) Research methods in education, , London: Routledge, and; David, M., Sutton, C., (2004) Social research: The basics, , London: Sage, and; Edwards, C., Evaluating European public awareness of science initiatives: A review of the literature (2004) Science Communication, 25, pp. 260-271; (2005) Science communication events: EUSCE/X white book, , Göteborg: Author; (2008) EUSCEA in short, , Göteborg: Author; Falk, J.H., Storksdieck, M., Dierking, L.D., Investigating public science interest and understanding: Evidence for the importance of free-choice learning (2007) Public Understanding of Science, 16 (4), pp. 455-469; Farmelo, G., From big bang to damp squib (1997) Science today: Problem or crisis?, pp. 92-100. , Levinson R., Thomas J., (eds), London: Routledge, In, Edited by; Featherstone, H., Wilkinson, C., Bultitude, K., (2009) Public engagement map: Report to the Science for All expert group, , London: Department for Business, Innovation and Skills, and; Fikus, M., A festival against ignorance (2007) ACADEMIA: The Magazine of the Polish Academy of Sciences, 3 (15), pp. 48-49. , http://www.euscea.org/Resources/Repository/Euscea/Downloads/str%20%2048-49_fikus_eng.pdf, Retrieved from; Friedman, A., (2008) Framework for evaluating impacts of informal science education projects, , http://informalscience.org/evaluations/eval_framework.pdf, Arlington, VA: National Science Foundation, Retrieved from, ed; Gage, S., Edinburgh International Science Festival (2001) Science communication in theory and practice, pp. 203-218. , Stocklmayer S., Gore M., Bryant C., (eds), London: Kluwer Academic, In, Edited by; Gaur, A.S., Gaur, S.S., (2009) Statistical methods for practice and research: A guide to data analysis using SPSS, , 2, New Delhi: Sage, and; Grand, A., Engaging through dialogue: International experiences of café scientifique (2009) Practising science communication in the information age: Theorising professional practices, pp. 209-226. , Holliman R., Thomas J., Smidt S., Scanlon E., Whitelegg E., (eds), Oxford: Oxford University Press, In, Edited by; Grant, L., (2004) Evaluation of Cheltenham Festival of Science 2004, , http://www.lauragrantassociates.co.uk/Resources/Resources/6/Cheltenham%20festival%20evaluation%202004.pdf, Liverpool: University of Liverpool, Retrieved from; Gregory, J., Miller, S., (1998) Science in public: Communication, culture, and credibility, , New York: Plenum Trade, and; Heong, K.L., Escalada, M.M., Scaling up communication of scientific information to rural communities (2005) JCom, 4 (3), pp. 1-3. , http://jcom.sissa.it/, Retrieved from, and; Joubert, M., Report: Priorities and challenges for science communication in South Africa (2001) Science Communication, 22, pp. 316-333; Kim, H.-S., PEP/IS: A new model for communicative effectiveness of science (2007) Science Communication, 28, pp. 287-313; McCallie, E., Bell, L., Lohwater, T., Falk, J.H., Lehr, J.L., Lewenstein, B.V., Wiehe, B., (2009) Many experts, many audiences: Public engagement with science and informal science education (A CAISE Inquiry Group Report), , http://caise.insci.org/uploads/docs/public_engagement_with_science.pdf, Washington, DC: Center for Advancement of Informal Science Education, Retrieved from, and; McDonald, D., Evaluating the unevaluatable: The case of science festivals Paper presented at the annual meeting of the 2009 Science Communication Conference, , London. : June; Miah, A., Genetics, cyberspace and bioethics: Why not a public engagement with ethics?

The participants in this study are seven sixth-grade pupils from four different classes, comprising five girls and two boys. The results reveal that the use of argumentation in the elaboration process not only helps the students to examine the validity of science projects but also guides them to reflect on the consistency of the projects' objective, experimental design, results, and conclusion. It was also found that rebuttals are not evident in scientific projects, and though the data claim that warrants are key elements of the elaboration process in a science fair, their meanings are not easily understood by primary-school students. Teachers are required to continuously explain the importance of argumentation. In addition, formulating conclusions based on empirical data is difficult for students. On the other hand, collecting and refining data as evidence to support or disprove a given temporary conclusion are less complicated tasks for the students. © 2011, Copyright Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Argumentation; Inquiry; Science fair",,,,,,"National Science Council, NSC: NSC 96-2511-S-110-001-MY3","This study was supported by the National Science Council, Taiwan, under grant NSC 96-2511-S-110-001-MY3.

It describes some of the claims and scientific uncertainties surrounding hydrogen energy. It examines qualitative evidence from a series of recent case studies in the UK about public perceptions of hydrogen. It is shown that public attitudes towards citizen engagement are highly ambivalent. While citizens approve of greater consultation, they raise doubts about the degree to which laypersons can be mobilised to participate in public debates, they express contradictory views about their trust in experts, and they are sceptical about whether such involvement will influence policy. These findings add further questions about the efficacy of upstream public engagement in assessments of emergent or novel technologies. They also suggest that over-optimistic expectations about upstream engagement may have to be moderated. © 2011, Copyright Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Hydrogen energy; Trust; Uncertain science; Upstream public engagement",,,,,,"PPRO 4/54/2

The essence of science theatre at school is to shape a contextualisation for science and technology and its relationships to individuals and society at large, with the aim to trigger the imagination, raise questions and stimulate debate among the audience to increase their understanding of the SSI at stake. To further the theoretical basis of science theatre at school, we investigated students’ experiences in coherence with the views from experts about the play’s possibilities and limitations, in the context of a performance about food science and technology. The play dramatised dilemmas that were related to science as a knowledge‐producing process, and through its consumer products. Our study indicated that the societal context for staging science and technology, through consumers’ dilemmas to eat healthy, raised interest among the students to a larger extent than the subject of science and technology per se. According to both students and experts, the level of scientific complexity and the use of caricature to portray scientists may have hampered the possibilities to reach the audience. An alternative to contextualisation on an individualised level is to make scientific controversy and its relationship to various social interests, the heart of the matter. The discussion after the play was considered crucial and appreciated, although the students were critical about the nature of the theses. Exploring the moral positions involved in dilemmas could provide an alternative perspective of understanding to the audience. © 2011, Copyright Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Experimental study; Nature of science; Qualitative research; Science theatre; Scientific literacy; Secondary school",,,,,,"050-32-016","We would like to thank all schools for their cooperation in this project, in particular the participating students.

At the high school level, parental involvement can be particularly problematic. This paper describes a pilot programme which was designed to engage mothers in the kind of science that their children would encounter in high school, to encourage greater confidence in their science knowledge and experience. It was envisaged that this would, in its turn, facilitate conversations about science between these women and their teenage children. A constructivist, hands‐on approach to learning, using easily available materials, ensured that most activities could be repeated in the home environment. The approach was gender‐specific and culturally appropriate to the age group. Seventeen mothers attended the programme over six mornings. Evaluations indicate that there was a range of positive outcomes, particularly in the reported level of parent–child discussions. There is a necessity for further research, however, to investigate the effect on the students, to encompass a broader participant demographic, and achieve a transferable model. © 2011, Copyright Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Home involvement; Mothers; Parents",,,,,,,,,,,"Andre, T., Whigham, M., Hendrickson, A., Chambers, S., Competency beliefs, positive affect and gender stereotypes of elementary students and their parents about science versus other school subjects (1999) Journal of Research in Science Teaching, 36, pp. 719-747; Baker, D.P., Stevenson, D.L., Mothers' strategies for children's school achievement: Managing the transition to high school (1985) Sociology of Education, 59, pp. 156-166; Bandura, A., Barbarinelli, C., Caprara, G.V., Pastorelli, C., Multi‐faceted impact of self‐efficacy beliefs on academic functioning (1996) Child Development, 67, pp. 1206-1222; Chambers, D.W., Stereotypic images of the scientist: The Draw‐a‐Scientist Test (1983) Science Education, 67, pp. 255-265; Cobern, W.W., (1998) Sociocultural perspectives on science education.

This paper reports on a project to investigate different approaches to engaging students in argument and discussion including online debate outside lesson time. The project involved incorporating different types of discussion into sixth form (students aged 16–17) biology lessons. An opportunity sample of six experienced teachers and their classes (totalling 84 students) was recruited. In all, five online discussions between schools, one online within school discussion and four face‐to‐face discussions were analysed for their quality of argument. Results indicate that, within this sample, the dialogue in online discussions demonstrated higher levels of argumentation than those in face‐to‐face discussions. Students in the face‐to‐face discussions volunteered less evidence to support their arguments and were less likely to challenge each other’s points. Students reported they learned slightly more from online discussion than from face‐to‐face discussion; this was confirmed by their teachers. Whilst this study is clearly limited by size and the unanticipated events within school that limited the amount of data collected, it was concluded that online discussion is worth further investigation by education practitioners. It offers opportunities to bring students together across time and space to practise justifying and defending their point of view. © 2011, Copyright Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Argumentation; Discussion; Ethics; Online; Science education",,,,,,,"The DAIS research team would like to gratefully acknowledge the sponsorship from Becta, the British Educational Communications Technology Agency, and the support of their co-researchers working in schools, often under somewhat trying circumstances, together with their students without whom this project would not have reached completion.",,,,"Aitken, R.C.B., Measurement of feeling using visual analogue scales (1969) Proceedings of the Royal Society of Medicine, 62, pp. 989-993; Bonk, C.J., Graham, C.R., (2006) Handbook of blended learning: Global perspectives, local designs, , San Francisco, CA: Pfeiffer, and, eds; Clark, D.B., Sampson, V.D., Personally‐seeded discussions to scaffold online argumentation (2007) International Journal of Science Education, Part B, 29 (3), pp. 253-277; Dawson, V.M., Venville, G., Teaching strategies for developing students’ argumentation skills about socio‐scientific issues in high school genetics (2008) Research in Science Education, 40 (2), pp. 133-148; Donnelly, J., Ethics and the science curriculum (2004) School Science Review, 86 (315), pp. 29-32; Erduran, S., Ardac, D., Yakmaci‐Guzel, B., Learning to teach argumentation: Case studies of pre‐service secondary science teachers (2006) Eurasia Journal of Mathematics, Science and Technology Education, 2 (2), pp. 1-14; Erduran, S., Simon, S., Osborne, J., TaPPing into argumentation: Developments in the application of Toulmin’s Argument Pattern for studying science discourse (2004) Science Education, 88 (6), pp. 915-933; Erduran, S., Simon, S., Osborne, (2004) Ideas, evidence and argument in science project, , London: King’s College London, and; Felton, D., Kuhn, D., The development of argumentative discourse skill (2001) Discourse Processes, 32 (2-3), pp. 135-153; Fleetwood, J., Gracely, E., Vaught, W., Kassutto, Z., Feldman, D., Novack, D., MedEthEx Online: A computer‐based learning program in medical ethics and communication skills (2000) Teaching and Learning in Medicine, 12 (2), pp. 96-104; Gibson, W., Negotiating textual talk: Conversation analysis, pedagogy and the organisation of online asynchronous discourse (2009) British Educational Research Journal, 35 (5), pp. 705-721; Hall, E., Science and ethics: Give them a break (2004) School Science Review, 86 (315), pp. 25-28; Hara, N., Bonk, C.J., Angeli, C., Content analysis of online discussion in an applied educational psychology course (2002) Instructional Science, 28, pp. 115-152; Jarvela, S., Hakkinen, P., Levels of web‐based discussion: Theory of perspective‐taking as a tool for analyzing interaction Fourth international conference of the Learning Sciences, pp. 22-26. , Fishman B., O’Connor‐Divelbiss S., (eds), Mahwah, NJ: Erlbaum, and,.
