This study investigates how suffering in love is metaphorically conceptualized in Turkish via natural phenomena and disasters. Based on figurative expressions in sad love songs of Arabesque and Art music genres, the study reveals that love pain/suffering is expressed through three salient metaphors: 1) love paın/sufferıng ıs natural phenomena, 2) love paın/sufferıng ıs natural dısasters, and 3) the overarching metaphor (the suffering) lover’s body ıs a landscape (affected by weather conditions or natural disasters). It was unearthed from metaphoric expressions in lyrics that as part of a cultural scenario, natural phenomena and disasters are profiled as internalized forces culturally imagined to directly affect vital body parts to express the emotional distress or anguish of the Turkish lover. The overarching metaphor lover’s body ıs a landscape is a manifestation of conceptual integration producing a novel structure in which natural phenomena appear to occur in or to culturally selected body parts or organs. The study makes a distinction between the three metaphors above about body parts and the well-known love ıs a natural force (which affects the WHOLE body as if it were an object being swept away or blown about, etc.). © 2020, © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Aksan, Y., Kantar, D., When LOVE IS A JOURNEY in English and in Turkish (2007) Current trends in pragmatics, pp. 93-109. , Cap P., Nijakowska J., (eds), Cambridge: Cambridge Scholars Press, &,.

If that sounds like someone talking about metaphor, it is because ploke is to schemes as metaphor is to tropes. Like metaphor, ploke is the linguistic reflex of a neurocognitive pattern bias (repetition to metaphor’s similitude). Like metaphor, ploke is not a single figure but many (epanaphora, epiphora and epizeuxis, for instance, to metaphor’s personification, anthropomorphism, and reification). Like metaphor, there are “dead” ploke as well as live ploke (for instance, the number of repeated instances of ploke and metaphor in this abstract that likely escaped your figurative notice, just as leg of a table and head of lettuce regularly escape our figurative notice). Like metaphor, the processes that give rise to ploke, are also highly productive–in word formation, in the acquisition and dissolution of language, in construction and idiom formation, in large patterns of thought and discourse, often leveraging iconicities (the principle of quantity and the principle of identity). I offer each of these analogies to support the superordinate analogy, Ploke : Scheme :: Metaphor : Trope, and argue for the centrality of this neglected figure. © 2020, © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,"Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada, SSHRC","This work was funded by the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada.

We examined three types of topic-attributed features: (i) distinctive features of the target metaphor, (ii) distinctive features of the competitive metaphor (unique features of a metaphor that has the same topic as the target metaphor but a different vehicle), and (iii) common features (features that are shared by both the target and competitive metaphors). Both metaphor aptness (Experiment 1: N = 132) and preference (Experiment 2: N = 90) were more pronounced when the distinctive features of the target metaphor rather than those of the competitive metaphor and common features were attributed to the topic. These results suggest that distinctive features determine the use of a specific metaphorical expression. These findings have implications for metaphor production and use because they can be used to identify the most apt vehicle. © 2020, © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Bates, D., Mächler, M., Bolker, B.M., Walker, S.C., Fitting linear mixed-effects models using lme4 (2015) Journal of Statistical Software, 67 (1), pp. 1-48; Beaty, R.E., Silvia, P.J., Metaphorically speaking: Cognitive abilities and the production of figurative language (2013) Memory & Cognition, 41 (2), pp. 255-267; Chiappe, D.L., Chiappe, P., The role of working memory in metaphor production and comprehension (2007) Journal of Memory and Language, 56 (2), pp. 172-188; Chiappe, D.L., Kennedy, J.M., Aptness predicts preference for metaphors or similes, as well as recall bias (1999) Psychonomic Bulletin & Review, 6 (4), pp. 668-676; George, T., Wiley, J., Forgetting the literal: The role of inhibition in metaphor comprehension (2016) Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition, 42 (8), pp. 1324-1330; George, T., Wiley, J., When is literal meaning inhibited?

Across three experiments (N= 2399), we examined the relative power of metaphor framing in different communication formats. Participants read, heard, or watched someone report a series of metaphorically framed issues. They answered a target question about each issue by selecting between two response options, one of which was conceptually congruent with the metaphor frame. Results revealed a similarly-sized metaphor framing effect in each communication modality. Neither speaker gender nor race reliably moderated the effects of metaphor framing for audiovisual messages, though framing effects were stronger when the gender of the speaker and observer matched. We also replicated the finding that metaphors are more effective when they are extended into the response option language. These results provide new insights into the efficacy and generalizability of metaphor framing. © 2020, © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,"State University of New York, SUNY","We thank K. M.

Yet, one of the most important life stages especially for many women, pregnancy, has received little attention to date. This paper seeks to close the gap by investigating the use of metaphors in 411,362 words of internet pregnancy discussions. In particular, it compares how forum contributors used metaphors to frame different gestational issues across the three trimesters of pregnancy. Using a corpus-assisted approach, we found that various types of metaphors, namely objectification, personification, violence, and constraint metaphors, performed different discursive roles in portraying such issues as fetal development, pregnancy discomforts, and birth-giving stages. While we demonstrated that metaphor is a staple tool for enhancing maternal–fetal attachment that empowers oneself and one’s fellow pregnant mothers, we also proposed the new term “attachment personification” for the use of unconventional metaphor not merely to personify but, furthermore, to foreground the personification of fetal movement in the womb. We also found that the interaction of metaphors with humor and hyperbole conveyed the uniquely expectant attitude of pregnant women toward their pregnancy discomforts, which is worth further attention in health communication studies. © 2020, © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Barak, A., Boniel-Nissim, M., Suler, J., Fostering empowerment in online support groups (2008) Computers in Human Behavior, 24 (5), pp. 1867-1883; Bergbom, I., Modh, C., Lundgren, I., Lindwall, L., First‐time pregnant women’s experiences of their body in early pregnancy (2017) Scandinavian Journal of Caring Sciences, 31 (3), pp. 579-586; Berk, R.A., The active ingredients in humor: Psychophysiological benefits and risks for older adults (2001) Educational Gerontology, 27 (3-4), pp. 323-339; Booth-Butterfield, M., Wanzer, M.B., Humor, stress and coping (2017) The psychology of humor at work: A psychological perspective, pp. 76-95. , Robert C., (ed), London, New York: Routledge, &,.

Similarly, theorists argue that metaphors are commonly used to communicate complex and abstract concepts. Though, the interpretation of visual metaphors has been studied in relation to film and advertising, referencing common metaphors used in language, research has yet to examine how individuals construct their own visual metaphors and whether existing language-based metaphors are used, as a basis. Studying the underlying structure of drawings, using organizing frameworks and mapping systems, provides insight into how individuals use metaphors to communicate and the interdependent relationships between text and image. This study applies conceptual metaphor theory and frame semantics to identify and map visual metaphors in drawings of Knowledge. Three research questions guided the study: How are visual metaphors [of Knowledge] inferred in participant drawings using existing language-based metaphors?; Can language-based metaphor ontologies and semantic systems be used for interpreting visual metaphors?; and How are inferences found in language-based metaphors evident in the design of visual metaphors? Data were collected as part of the study: What does knowledge look like?, where participants (N = 404) were asked to draw what they thought Knowledge looks like to them, and explain why they drew what they did in writing. Five example cases are presented in the results: 1) the Illuminated Light Bulb, 2) the Electric Brain, 3) the Brain as a Container for Knowledge, 4) Knowledge (Ideas) as Food, and 5) the Open Mind. The findings present three notable conclusions: the combination of multiple metaphors within a single drawing; the use of a language-based metaphor ontology (i.e., Master Metaphor List) and frame semantics as analytic tools to examine visual metaphors; and the potential for additional language-based metaphor categories to emerge. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Berg, T., Bowen, T., Smith, C., Smith, S., Visualising the future: Surfacing student perspectives on post-graduation prospects using rich pictures (2017) Higher Education Research & Development, 36 (7), pp. 1339-1354; Berg, T., Pooley, R., Rich pictures: Collaborative communication through icons (2013) Systemic Practice and Action Research, 26 (4), pp. 361-376; Bowen, T., Evans, M.M., What does knowledge look like?

The British, American, Spanish, and French languages show significant variations of meaning of the metaphorical expression “Mother Earth/Nature” used in press articles discussing climate change. The shift from conceptual metaphor theory to metaphor scenarios operated in this research reveals major adjustments to Lakoff’s findings with, notably, the identification of a “STRICT MOTHER” in our corpus. The cross-linguistic perspective also emphasizes socio-cultural influence on the metaphorical interpretation and the related metaphorical frames. For instance, our results highlight linguistic evidences of language-specific and culture-specific characterizations of the “MOTHER”. The reliance on “RELIGION” metaphors in climate change discourses has been previously documented by researchers. However, we demonstrate that the reliance on myths has a significant role to play in the characterization of the “MOTHER” in different languages. The association between the myths and the frames related to the figure of the “MOTHER” also influences the understanding of the topic of climate change fulfilling different argumentative stances. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Atanasova, D., Koteyko, N., Metaphors in The Guardian Online and The Mail Online opinion-page content on climate change: War, religion, and politics (2017) Environmental Communication, 11 (4), pp. 452-469; Bremmer, J.N., (2008), Greek religion and culture, the Bible, and the ancient Near East.

In three studies we demonstrate the existence of a mental association between physical weight (light vs. heavy) and disability (non-disabled vs. disabled) as well as its bi-directional causal effects (from weight to disability and from disability to weight). In Study 1 (N = 250), participants exhibited the hypothesized association between the dimensions on both a direct and an indirect measure. Study 2 (N = 191) demonstrated that perceived weight affects the perceived severity of a disability, with the weight of a clipboard held by participants affecting perceptions of a target person’s stutter or limp. Study 3 (N = 103) testified to the reverse effect: participants who heard a monologue by someone with a pronounced (as opposed to mild) stutter perceived the clipboard they were holding as heavier and estimated its weight in grams as higher. Our findings may suggest that experiences of weight affect both estimates of the prevalence of disabilities in others and in the self as well as level of identification with the disabled.

The purpose of the present research was to utilize conceptual metaphor theory to study the effect of metaphor use on money anxiety and spending intentions. Specifically, in three experiments, participants were randomly assigned to complete a word search puzzle where they either found the word fortune or where they searched but were unable to find the word wealth. The results revealed that the act of finding the word fortune in comparison to searching for wealth decreased concerns about money (Studies 1–3) and increased spending intentions (Study 3). These findings suggest how the activation of subtle money-related metaphors can influence attitudes and perceptions toward money. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,"The authors would like to thank Kiely Alfieri, Austin Lemke, Christian Sullivan, and Evan Wilson for their assistance with data collection.",,"Boroditsky, L., Ramscar, M., The roles of body and mind in abstract thought (2002) Psychological Science, 13, pp. 185-189; Bruner, J.S., Goodman, C.C., Value and need as organizing factors in perception (1947) The Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology, 42, pp. 33-44; Cacioppo, J.T., Petty, R.E., The need for cognition (1982) Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 42, pp. 116-131; Chang, C.T., Yen, C.T., Missing ingredients in metaphor advertising: The right formula of metaphor type, product type, and need for cognition (2013) Journal of Advertising, 42, pp. 80-94; Crowne, D.P., Marlowe, D., A new scale of social desirability independent of psychopathology (1960) Journal of Consulting Psychology, 24, pp. 349-354; Dubois, D., Rucker, D.D., Galinsky, A.D., The accentuation bias: Money literally looms larger (and sometimes smaller) to the powerless (2010) Social Psychological and Personality Science, 1, pp. 199-205; Eysenck, H.J., Eysenck, S.B.G., (1964) Manual of the Eysenck personality inventory, , San Diego, CA: EdITS; Fetterman, A.K., Robinson, M.D., Gordon, R.D., Elliot, A.J., Anger as seeing red: Perceptual sources of evidence (2011) Social Psychological and Personality Science, 2, pp. 311-316; Furnham, A., Wilson, E., Telford, K., The meaning of money: The validation of a short money-types measure (2012) Personality and Individual Differences, 52, pp. 707-711; Gino, F., Pierce, L., The abundance effect: Unethical behavior in the presence of wealth (2009) Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes, 109, pp. 142-155; Hampson, D.P., McGoldrick, P.J., A typology of adaptive shopping patterns in recession (2013) Journal of Business Research, 66, pp. 831-838; Hayhoe, C.R., Cho, S.H., DeVaney, S.A., Worthy, S.L., Kim, J., Gorham, E., How do distrust and anxiety affect saving behavior?

In the current study, we investigated whether the pace of life, a previously unexplored factor, influences people’s temporal reasoning at city level and individual level. Results showed that participants with a slow pace of life tended to adopt the Moving Ego perspective than participants with a fast pace of life.

What is the purpose and the function of using a non-salient ground? We identify and discuss three types of non-standard similes, each exhibiting certain semantic and structural traits as well as a distinct pragmatic or communicative function. In the ironic simile, the ground is the antithesis of a salient feature (e.g., “as clear as mud”). In the humorous simile, the surprising ground comes as a punchline to solve a kind of riddle (e.g., “What do politicians and diapers have in common? Both need to be changed often”). And in the poetic simile, the introduction of a non-salient quality encourages the reader to rethink the source term itself (e.g., “waves as formal as scales on a fish”). © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Aisenman, R., Structure-mapping and the simile–metaphor preference (1999) Metaphor and Symbol, 14 (1), pp. 45-51; Attardo, S., The semantic foundations of cognitive theories of humor (1997) Humor, 10 (4), pp. 395-420; Attardo, S., Humorous metaphors (2015) Cognitive linguistics and humor research, pp. 91-110. , Brône G., Feyaerts K., Veale T., (eds), Berlin, Germany: De Gruyter Mouton,.

Such global constructional responses will be derived by default once their stimuli are free of factors known to affect processing of nonliteralness. They should, therefore, be (a) novel; (b), free of local cues such as semantic anomaly or internal incongruity; and (c) free of contextual support. Here we weigh global non-metaphorical constructions, meeting conditions (a-c) for defaultness (S/he is not the most fascinating speaker around) against novel, nondefault metaphorical counterparts, not meeting these conditions (S/he is not the most sparkling drink in the pub). The metaphorical constructions, involving a local, semantically anomalous cue, further deautomatize conventionalized counterparts (S/he is not the sharpest pencil in the box), which renders them optimally innovative. Given that the metaphorical constructions involve local semantic anomaly, this precludes them from being derived by default (see (b) above). Despite this difference between the two kinds of (metaphorical and non-metaphorical) stimuli, they all share the same global construction, involving strong attenuation of highly positive concepts. Results of four offline, corpus-based experiments, and three corpus-based studies show that both these (metaphorical and non-metaphorical) constructions are interpreted sarcastically. As such, they further affect text production which often unfolds via mirroring default rather than nondefault responses. Still, the innovative metaphorical uses an increased degree of sarcasm, rendering these stimuli more pleasing. Although the global constructional responses reign supreme, the optimally innovative metaphoricalness contributes to both, the sarcastic nature of the responses and their hedonic effects. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Ball, L.J., Threadgold, E., Marsh, J.E., Christensen, B.T., The effects of stimulus complexity and conceptual fluency on aesthetic judgments of abstract art: Evidence for a default–Interventionist account (2018) Metaphor and Symbol, 33 (3), pp. 235-252; Beardsley, C.M., (1958) Aesthetics, , New York, NY: Harcourt, Brace and World; Becker, I., Giora, R., The defaultness hypothesis: A quantitative corpus-based study of non/default sarcasm and literalness production (2018) Journal of Pragmatics, 138, pp. 149-164; Berlyne, D.E., (1960) Conflict, arousal and curiosity, , New York, NY: McGraw-Hill; Du Bois, W.J., Towards a dialogic syntax (2014) Cognitive Linguistics, 25 (3), pp. 359-410; Filik, R., Howman, H., Ralph-Nearman, C., Giora, R., The role of defaultness in sarcasm interpretation: Evidence from eye-tracking during reading (2018) Metaphor and Symbol, 33 (3), pp. 148-162; Gibbs, W.R., Jr., (1994) The poetics of mind: Figurative thought, language, and understanding, , New York, NY: Cambridge University Press; Giora, R., Understanding figurative and literal language: The graded salience hypothesis (1997) Cognitive Linguistics, 8 (3), pp. 183-206; Giora, R., (2003) On our mind: Salience, context, and figurative language, , New York, NY: Oxford University Press; Giora, R., How defaultness shapes our language production: A usage-based study of discoursal resonance with default interpretations of metaphor and sarcasm Production of figurative language, , Submitted,Barnden J., Gargett A., (eds), John Benjamins,.

Interestingly, the linguistic expression of subjective time manifests an asymmetric pattern, systematically favoring the use of Time-moving, rather than Ego-moving, metaphors (cf. “Time passes quickly” vs ?“We pass (our) time quickly”). The present paper focuses specifically on compressed time (i.e., time as passing quickly) and suggests that the experience of subjective time resonates with a construal that lacks agency on the part of the experiencer. This association explains why the conceptualization of compressed time lends itself to the Time-moving perspective but can also account for expressions that override metaphor. The analysis is based on poetic discourse on the assumption that creativity attests to the affordances of our mental representations. This line of research has implications for possible constraints on metaphorical conceptualization at large. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Arstila, V., Lloyd, D., (2014) Subjective time: The philosophy, psychology, and neuroscience of temporality, , Cambridge, MA: The MIT Press; Block, R., Models of psychological time (1990) Cognitive models of psychological time, pp. 1-36. , Block R., (ed), Hillsdale, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum,.

In this article, we present the first systematic study of cancer as a metaphor in contemporary English. We show the forms, frequencies, and functions of 925 metaphorical uses of cancer-related vocabulary in two large English language corpora, and discuss their implications for: (a) the framing of the phenomena that are most frequently described as cancers and of potential courses of action to be taken in relation to these phenomena; (b) perceptions of cancer itself; and (c) theoretical accounts of what makes a metaphor successful, in terms of its effectiveness and its applicability to a wide range of topics. In this way, we provide detailed evidence, and additional nuance, for Sontag’s critique of cancer as a metaphor and put forward an explanation for the current persistence of this metaphor, despite its controversial status. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

The study employs both lexical and corpus-based approaches in order to gain insights into their manifestation in the two languages. In an attempt to show how the two primary metaphors manifest themselves at the linguistic level, the study lays out the linguistic patterns that reflect the underlying conceptual associations across the metaphorical domains, and analyzes the differences as well as similarities between English and Chinese. It is argued that primary metaphors may manifest themselves at different levels of specificity within and across different languages. The findings support the views that conceptual associations of primary metaphors may or may not lead to productive linguistic patterns in a language, and that speakers’ linguistic experience may play an important role in shaping their metaphorical conceptualizations, in conjunction and interaction with their bodily and cultural experience. The study, therefore, sheds light on the mutuality between language and thought. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Casasanto, D., Linguistic relativity (2016) The Routledge handbook of semantics, pp. 158-174. , Riemer N., (ed), New York, NY: Routledge,.

It builds on the scenario-based approach to irony where ironic meaning is treated as a contextually adjustable meaning inference resulting from a clash between an echoed and an observed scenario. The article discusses five ways of endowing the ironic echo with complexity: (i) through the degree of elaboration of the cultural and sociohistorical references in it; (ii) through echoic compounding; (iii) through the creation of echoic chains; (iv) through the construction of cumulative echoes; and (v) through the creation of multi-operational echoes, which incorporate the cognitive operations involved in other figurative uses of language such as metaphor, metonymy, and hyperbole. The first strategy addresses the contextualized content of the ironic echo, while the other strategies are a matter of its conceptual structure. In addition, the article studies the role of echoic marking in creating strengthened ironic effects similar to those achieved through cumulative echoes and compares complexity in ironic echoing with other cases of conceptual complexity. Finally, it discusses the role of echoic complexes within the scenario-based approach. The resulting analysis of ironic echoes endows the study of this phenomenon with greater descriptive delicacy and explanatory systematicity than previous accounts, while contemplating irony within the broader picture of complexity in conceptualization. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,"The research on which this article is based has been financed by the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness, grant no.

A more producer-centric context is picture-based counseling (PBC) where clients are prompted by counselors to interpret pictures creatively as part of the treatment process. Nevertheless, the affective and discursive outcomes of these interpretations remain poorly understood. This paper reports a combined experimental and discourse analytic study which compares prompting strategies in terms of affective engagement, contrasts the discourse characteristics of interpretations following “topic-present” and “topic-absent” prompting strategies, and offers potential implications for PBC practice. Analysis of skin conductance levels suggests that the two prompting strategies which invite symbolic interpretation are more affectively engaging than the literal control (F(2,32) = 6.356, p =.005), but not significantly different from each other. A follow-up discourse analysis revealed the prominence of metaphors in symbolic interpretations, as well as nuanced differences between the discourse outcomes of prompting strategies. Topic-present interpretations tended to produce more systematic ensembles of metaphorical expressions, while topic-absent interpretations were less systematic. The combined findings suggest that orienting clients towards symbolic interpretation is affectively engaging, but the ideal prompting strategy is best determined by context-specific circumstances to be judged by counselors. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,"PolyU 156033/18H

Gibson, and its extension into developmental research and theory, as developed by E.J. Gibson and others. This framework suggests that a basic compatibility and meaningfulness exists between the knower and the known, based on the direct perception of affordances. To build an ecological understanding of metaphor we need to clarify how this metaphysical ground plays out in acts of knowing that involve metaphor. In this endeavor, it is important to understand the ontogenesis of novel insightful metaphors and the role of perception. Developmental ecological psychology has repeatedly shown that infants can perceive meta-modal invariants that specify persistence of qualities. Early metaphors are consequences of the process in which invariants over naturally occurring kinds are perceived. Thus, novel metaphor production is an act of situated and experience-dependent perceiving and acting in the ecological world of socially shared meanings. Examples from previous experimental and qualitative research are reviewed to substantiate theoretical claims. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Adolph, E., Kretch, K.S., Gibson's theory of perceptual learning.

Metaphorical expression is typically viewed now as bodily enactment of mentally represented metaphorical concepts. My aim in this article is to advance the idea that metaphorical performances are always part of dynamical, ecological cognition and must always be characterized as embodied, enactive, embedded, and extended. The dynamical–ecological perspective emphasizes how human thought and action continuously change over time with metaphor, more specifically, emerging in partial and probabilistic ways given what particular ecologies best afford. I describe different metaphorical performances as they arise in varying situations as people face adaptive challenges. Part of my claim is that metaphorical meanings only exist within the context of their bodily articulations in specific ecological contexts. Embracing a dynamical–ecological approach to metaphor comes with the significant conclusion that metaphor is not a discrete event or activity that is suddenly “there” inside people’s minds but is a dynamical constraint on action that is distributed across brains, bodies, and real-world ecologies. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Abrahamson, D., Sánchez-García, R., Smyth, C., Looi, C.-K., Polman, J., Cress, U., Reimann, P., Metaphors are projected constraints on action: An ecological dynamics view on learning across the disciplines (2016) “Transforming learning, empowering learners,” Proceedings of the International Conference of the Learning Sciences (ICLS 2016) (pp. 314–321), , Singapore: National Institute of Education, &,. &, (Eds; Ackerman, J., Nocera, C., Bargh, J., Incidental haptic sensations influence social judgments and decisions (2010) Science, 328, pp. 1712-1715; Beilock, S., Beyond the playing field: Sport psychology meets embodied cognition (2008) International Review of Sport and Exercise Psychology, 1, pp. 19-30; Caballero, R., (2006) Re-viewing space: Figurative language in architects’ assessment of built space, , Berlin: DeGruyter; Chemero, A., (2009) Radical embodied cognitive science, , Cambridge, MA: MIT Press; Cienki, A., Müller, C., (2008) Metaphor and gesture, , Amsterdam: Benjamins, &, (Eds; Colby, B., Fernandez, J., The Japanese tea ceremony: Coherence theory and metaphor in social adaptation (1992) Beyond metaphor: The theory of tropes in anthropology, pp. 244-262. , Stanford, CA: Stanford University Press,.

We do so by presenting an ecological view of cognition as a skull-and-body-transcending activity that is deeply entangled with the environment. Grounded in empirical examples we present and examine four claims fleshing out this ecological perspective on cognition and metaphor: (a) metaphor is a product of an organism–environment-system, rather than merely a product of an inner mental process, (b) metaphoric meaning is relational. It emerges from projections of structure between a living organism and its perceived or imagined environment, (c) underlying metaphor is the notion of metaphoricity, which is a scalar value involving a doubleness in experience, and (d) metaphoricity relies on experiential affordances that can be directly perceived or felt in the environment. Overall, we propose that metaphor should be understood and thought about in terms of affordances rather than mental ability. Studying metaphor as affordances is to focus on metaphor as part of our active doings that equally involve cognitive, social, and linguistic dimensions. Within an ecological framework, there is no contradiction between studying the details of linguistic, multimodal, and embodied behavior in situational contexts while considering the cognitive dimensions of this behavior too since cognition is re-conceptualized as constituted by actions in an environment. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Anderson, M., (2014) After phrenology: Neural Reuse and the interactive brain, , Cambridge, MA: MIT Press; Bateson, G., (1972) Steps to an ecology of mind.Collected essays in, , 1st, Antropology, Evolution, and Epistemology, Edition; Brunswik, E., Organismic achievement and environmental probability (1943) Psychological Review, 50 (3), pp. 255-272; Cameron, L., Confrontation or complementarity?: Metaphor in language use and cognitive metaphor theory (2007) Annual Review of Cognitive Linguistics, 5 (1), pp. 107-135; Cameron, L., Mixed metaphors from a discourse dynamics perspective—A non-issue?

In this article, these basic assumptions are illustrated and critically evaluated from the point of view of gesture and film studies. In a theoretical introduction, the idea of metaphorizing as embodied interactivity is developed and connected with these basic assumptions of an ecological cognition approach to metaphor. Four case studies illustrate how metaphoricity in face-to-face contexts and in film viewing is enacted, extended, embedded, and embodied. Examples from gesturing face-to-face and a case study of a television news report serve to illustrate how metaphors in these ecologies have important common characteristics: they emerge from metaphorizing as embodied interactivity. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Bühler, K., (1933) Ausdruckstheorie: das system an der geschichte aufgezeigt, , Jena, Germany: Fischer; Bühler, K., (1990) Theory of language: The representational function of language, , D.

Using ethnographic material collected from two real estate showrooms in China, we describe how each showroom setting is equipped with to-be-phenomenologically-experienced objects designed to stimulate desirable sensorimotor experiences and altered bodily states during the guided showroom tours. By analyzing the qualities of such settings and identifying the processes through which visitors become environmentally coupled—including active and passive touch in highly organized auditory, olfactory, and gustatory environs—we demonstrate how the showrooms constitute an affordance space for enacting metaphoricity through doubleness in experience. Implications for conceptual metaphor theory relating to the nature of environments and bodies are discussed. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Ackerman, J.M., Nocera, C.C., Bargh, J.A., Incidental haptic sensations influence social judgments and decision (2010) Science, 328, pp. 1712-1715; Barsalou, L.W., Grounded cognition (2008) Annual Review of Psychology, 59, pp. 617-645; Brownrigg, M., Hearing place: Film music, geography and ethnicity (2007) International Journal of Media and Cultural Politics, 3 (3), pp. 307-323; Clark, A., (1997) Being there: Putting brain, body, and world together again, , The MIT Press,.

The results suggest that hybrid pictorial metaphors are perceived more strongly than pictorial similes when they are presented on their own and in corrective convention but not when they are verbalized. We argue that hybrid pictorial metaphors have transformational effects as the fusion of two concepts allow the reader to see one thing in terms of another. Juxtaposition in a pictorial simile merely suggests a search for similarity, which is not explicit. Results also showed that verbalized metaphor (X is Y) or the simile (X is like Y) forms are often used to convey a similar meaning and strength for pictorial simile and pictorial metaphor. However, in corrective scenarios participants are forced to reassess visual features: in this situation, pictorial metaphors are considered more strongly than pictorial similes even when they are verbalized. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Berntsen, D., Kennedy, J.M., Contradictions between metaphors: A means of expressing an attitude (1994) Metaphor and Symbol, 9 (3), pp. 193-209; Berntsen, D., Kennedy, J.M., Unresolved contradictions specifying attitudes—In metaphor, irony, understatement and tautology (1996) Poetics, 24 (1), pp. 13-29; Billow, R.M., Metaphor: A review of the psychological literature (1977) Psychological Bulletin, 84, pp. 81-92; Binder, J.R., Swanson, S.J., Wagner, A.D., Demb, J.B., Shear, P.K., Glove, G.H., Rao, S.M., Determination of language dominance with functional MRI: A comparison with the Wada test (1995) Human Brain Mapping, 1, p. 235. , …; Black, M., Ortony, A., More about metaphor (1979) Metaphor and thought, pp. 19-43. , New York, NY: Cambridge University Press,.

Studies on the human body in cinema have documented how it changes according to underlying ideologies. Our research focuses on the role of image schemas and metaphors as they embody meanings and sociocultural paradigms. Metaphors also frame how the body is conceptualized according to dominating ideological practices such as (a) commodification, (b) the integration between artificial and organic, (c) dissatisfaction, (d) dynamics of beautification and idealization, and (e) politicization of the human body. We show how metaphors are creative tools to reframe meanings and representations of the body and how the body is a construct refashioned within the cinematic discourses of these films. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Bordwell, D., (1991) Making meaning: Inference and rhetoric in the interpretation of cinema, , Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press; Bordwell, D., (2013) Narration in the fiction film, , London, UK: Routledge; Bruno, G., (2002) Atlas of emotion: Journeys in art, architecture, and film, , New York, NY: Verso; Butler, J., (2011) Bodies that matter: On the discursive limits of sex, , London, UK: Routledge; Carroll, N., A note on film metaphor (1996) Journal of Pragmatics, 26 (6), pp. 809-822; Charteris-Black, J., (2004) Corpus approaches to critical metaphor analysis, , Berlin, Germany: Springer; Charteris-Black, J., (2011) Politicians and rhetoric: The persuasive power of metaphor, , 2nd, Basingstoke, UK: Palgrave Macmillan, ed; Charteris-Black, J., Musolff, A., “Battered hero” or “innocent victim”?

Although many factors contribute to our reasoning about hardships, in this article we focus on the role of linguistic metaphor in shaping how we cope. In five experiments, we find that framing a person’s cancer situation as a “battle” encourages people to believe that that person is more likely to feel guilty if they do not recover than framing the same situation as a “journey” does. Conversely, the “journey” frame is more likely to encourage the inference that the person can make peace with their situation than the “battle” frame. We rule out lexical priming as an explanation for this effect and examine the generalizability of these findings to individual differences across participants and to a different type of hardship—namely, an experience with depression. Finally, we examine the language participants produced after encountering one of these metaphors, and we find tendencies to repeat and extend the metaphors encountered. Together, these experiments shed light on the influential role of linguistic metaphor in the way we emotionally appraise hardship situations. © 2018, © 2018 The Author(s).

This article reviews the small body of research that has applied such representations to computational models of metaphor. After providing a short review of vector space models, a detailed overview of metaphor models that make use of vector space, and the relevant empirical findings are discussed. These models are divided into two categories based on their differing motivations: “psychological” models are motivated by modeling the cognitive processes involved in metaphor comprehension whereas “paraphrase” models seek to find the most efficient and accurate way for a computer to paraphrase metaphorical language. These models have been successful in computing adequate metaphor interpretations and shed light on the cognitive processes involved in comprehending metaphor. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,"Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada, NSERC: 06P0070","This research was supported by Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) Discovery Grant 06P0070.",,"Agatonovic-Kustrin, S., Beresford, R., Basic concepts of artificial neural network(ANN) modeling and its application in pharmaceutical research (2000) Journal of Pharmaceutical and Biomedical Analysis, 22 (5), pp. 717-727; Ahrens, K., Liu, H.L., Lee, C.Y., Gong, S.P., Fang, S.Y., Hsu, Y.Y., FunctionalMRI of conventional and anomalous metaphors in Mandarin Chinese (2007) Brain and Language, 100 (2), pp. 163-171; Al-Azary, H., Buchanan, L., Novel metaphor comprehension: Semantic neighbourhooddensity interacts with concreteness (2017) Memory & Cognition, 45 (2), pp. 296-307; Anderson, J.R., Milson, R., Human memory: An adaptive perspective (1989) Psychological Review, 96 (4), pp. 703-719; Rhetoric (1952) The works of Aristotle Vol. 11: Theoretica, de rhetorica ad alexandrum, poetica (pp. 1–51), , Ross W.D., (ed), Oxford: Clarendon Press,.

Participants performed a lexical decision task on lateralized probes (messy) related to the default/nondefault sarcastic interpretation of their preceding negative/affirmative targets (He is/He is not the most organized student). Consistent with the Defaultness Hypothesis, probes were easier to identify in the default-negative than in the nondefault-affirmative condition. However, this superiority was more pronounced in the left hemisphere (LH) than in the right hemisphere. In particular, whereas both hemispheres reflected the superiority of default negative sarcasm over nondefault affirmative sarcasm when both targets were embedded in equally strong sarcastic contexts (Experiment 2), only the LH exhibited this very same superiority when the negatives and affirmatives were presented in isolation (Experiment 1). © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,"Israel Science Foundation, ISF: 436/12","This research was supported by The Israel Science Foundation (grant no. 436/12) to Rachel Giora.",,"Banich, M.T., Davidson, R., Hugdahl, K., Interaction between the hemispheres and its implications for the processing capacity of the brain (2003) Brain asymmetry, 2, pp. 261-302. , Cambridge, MA: MIT Press,. &, (Eds; Beardsley, C.M., (1958) Aesthetics, , New York, NY: Harcourt, Brace and World; Berardi, N., Fiorentini, A., Christman, S., Interhemispheric transfer of spatial and temporal frequency information (1997) Cerebral asymmetries in sensory and perceptual processing, pp. 55-79. , New York, NY: Elsevier Science, &,.

The current research investigated an alternative view that broadens the focus on the comment itself, suggesting that mitigating a highly positive concept by using negation generates sarcastic interpretations by default. In the current study, pretests performed on the target utterances presented in isolation established their default interpretations; novel affirmative phrases (e.g., He is the best lawyer) were interpreted literally, whereas equally novel negative counterparts (e.g., He isn’t the best lawyer) were interpreted sarcastically. In Experiment 1 (an eye-tracking study), prior context biased these utterances toward literal or sarcastic interpretations. Results showed that target utterances were easier to process in contexts supporting their default interpretations, regardless of affirmation/negation. Results from a second eye-tracking experiment suggested that readers’ tendency to interpret negative phrases sarcastically is related to their own tendency to use malicious humor. Our findings suggest that negation leads to certain ambiguous utterances receiving sarcastic interpretations by default and that this process may be further intensified by personality factors. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,"British Academy: PM140296","The work reported in this article was supported by a grant from the British Academy International Partnership and Mobility Scheme (PM140296) awarded to Ruth Filik and Rachel Giora.",,"Au-Yeung, S.K., Kaakinen, J.K., Liversedge, S.P., Benson, V., Processing of written irony in autism spectrum disorder: An eye-movement study (2015) Autism Research, 8, pp. 749-760; Beardsley, C.M., (1958) Aesthetics, , New York, US: Harcourt, Brace and World; Blasko, D.G., Kazmerski, V.A., ERP Correlates of individual differences in the comprehension of nonliteral language (2006) Metaphor and Symbol, 21, pp. 267-284; Brown, P., Levinson, S., (1987) Politeness, , Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press; Bruntsh, R., Ruch, W., The role of humor-related traits and broad personality dimensions in irony use (2017) Personality and Individual Differences, 112, pp. 139-143; Clark, H.H., Clark, E.V., Kagan, J., (1977) Psychology and language: An introduction to psycholinguistics, 515. , New York, NY: Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, &, (,.

Previous research in this area has mainly required participants to answer questions based on written materials, and results have been mixed. With the aim of instead examining the emotional impact of sarcasm when used in a more conversational setting, the current study utilized animated video clips as stimuli. In each clip, one individual answered general knowledge questions while the other provided feedback that could be delivered either literally or sarcastically, and either complimented or criticized the question answerer’s performance. Participants rated the feedback based on (a) the anticipated emotional impact on the recipient, (b) how the speaker intended the recipient to feel, and (c) whether the speaker intended to be humorous. Results overall supported the Tinge Hypothesis, showing that sarcastic criticism was rated as less negative than literal criticism, and sarcastic compliments (also termed “ironic praise”) were rated as less positive than literal compliments, when judged from both the perspective of the recipient and of the speaker.

The present article goes further and argues that these types of hyperbole, as well as various others, are just special cases of reflexive hyperbole, a style that appears not previously to have been explored in its own right. The article therefore serves to introduce this style and to unify under it various more specific, disparate-seeming types of hyperbole, revealing their deep similarity. They all rest in a uniform way on a special property that some relationships have, namely of being reflexive in a broadened sense. The relationship of likeness is reflexive in the standard sense that any entity bears the relationship to itself with maximum possible strength. But some other relationships of interest in this article are only reflexive in a broader way that relaxes these universality and maximality requirements to an extent. The article also explains how reflexive hyperbole about likeness is a novel addition to the theory of metaphor, involving a distinctive interpretative process with special effects, and how reflexive hyperbole about part importance is not reducible to whole-for-part metonymy, because the latter does not systematically access sufficiently important parts. In addition, the article briefly considers the defaultness or otherwise of reflexive hyperbolic interpretations. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Barnden, J.A., Metaphor, simile, and the hyperbole of likeness (2015) Metaphor and Symbol, 30 (1), pp. 41-62; Barnden, J.A., Gola, E., Ervas, F., Metaphor and simile: Categorizing and comparing categorization and comparison (2016) Metaphor and Communication, pp. 25-46. , Amsterdam: John Benjamins,. &, (Eds; Barnden, J.A., Wallington, A., Foltz, A., Ryan, J., A hyperbole-based account of the paradoxical usage of ``literally’’ (2017) Selected Papers from UK CLA Meetings, 4, pp. 111-130. , http://www.uk-cla.org.uk/proceedings/volume_4_37, In, &, Eds; Bowdle, B.F., Gentner, D., The career of metaphor (2005) Psychological Review, 112 (1), pp. 193-216; Brdar-Szabó, R., Brdar, M., Burkhardt, A., Nerlich, B., “Mummy, I love you like a thousand ladybirds”: Reflections on the emergence of hyperbolic effects and the truth of hyperboles (2010) Tropical Truth(s): The epistemology of metaphor and other tropes, pp. 383-427. , Berlin: De Gruyter, &,. &, (Eds; Brontë, E., (1994) Wuthering Heights, , London: Penguin; Carston, R., Wearing, C., Metaphor, hyperbole and simile: A pragmatic approach (2011) Language and Cognition, 3 (2), pp. 283-312; Carston, R., Wearing, C., Hyperbolic language and its relation to metaphor and irony (2015) Journal Pragmatics, 79, pp. 79-92; Chiappe, D.L., Kennedy, J.M., Are metaphors elliptical similes?

But effective speakers do not travel alone when they move away from default meanings to novel, non-default destinations. Effective speakers bring their readers with them, sometimes by making the non-default destination the only meaningful destination that can be reached with an utterance, but other times by helpfully—if subtly—marking their utterances to facilitate the dislocation of words and meanings. We consider the relative utility of different indicators of non-defaultness in this article, ranging from the subtle to the overt. Our approach argues for the usefulness of machine-generated texts when quantitatively exploring aspects of human linguistic creativity, since machine-tooled utterances can better assure the consistency and comparability of novel utterances that are designed to offer strikingly original points of view. Within this mechanical framework, we measure the extent of the shift from default to non-default interpretations via the downshift from positive to negative affect in machine-generated ironic utterances. In using machine-generated texts, our approach and its results also argue for the possibility that intelligent machines can craft creative utterances of their own, and effectively communicate an ironic point-of-view to human readers. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group.",,,,,,,"European Commission, EC","This work was supported by grants from both Science Foundation Ireland (via the ADAPT project), and the European Commission (via the WHIM project).

We presented participants with paintings at two levels of complexity (high vs. low) and five levels of conceptual fluency (determined from a prior norming study) and requested separate ratings of beauty and creativity. Our predictions were derived from the PIA Model (Pleasure-Interest Model of Aesthetic Liking), which views aesthetic preferences as being formed by two, distinct fluency-based processes: an initial, automatic, stimulus-driven, default process and a subsequent, perceiver-driven deliberative process. A key trigger for deliberative processing is assumed to be disfluency at the default stage, as caused by factors such as visual complexity. We predicted that complexity and conceptual fluency would interact in determining aesthetic liking, with people preferring complex stimuli, but only when these are relatively easy to process conceptually. Our results supported this prediction for beauty judgments, although creativity judgments showed a curiously uniform profile. Nevertheless, the predictive capacity of the PIA Model in relation to beauty judgments attests to the explanatory strength of this default–interventionist theory of aesthetic liking. We conclude by noting important parallels between the PIA Model and the Revised Optimal Innovation Hypothesis, which likewise has broad reach in explaining how defaultness and non-defaultness affect pleasure across a range of linguistic and pictorial stimuli. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Ackerman, R., Thompson, V.A., Meta-Reasoning: Monitoring and control of thinking and reasoning (2017) Trends in Cognitive Sciences, 21, pp. 607-617; Ackerman, R., Thompson, V.A., Ball, L.J., Thompson, V.A., Meta-Reasoning: Shedding metacognitive light on reasoning research (2017) The Routledge international handbook of thinking and reasoning, , Abingdon, Oxon: Routledge, &,. &, (Eds; Alter, A.L., Oppenheimer, D.M., Epley, N., Eyre, R.N., Overcoming intuition: Metacognitive difficulty activates analytic reasoning (2007) Journal of Experimental Psychology: General, 136, pp. 569-576; Armstrong, T., Detweiler-Bedell, B., Beauty as an emotion: The exhilarating prospect of mastering a challenging world (2008) Review of General Psychology, 12, pp. 305-329; Ball, L., Threadgold, E., Solowiej, A., Marsh, J.E., Can intrinsic and extrinsic metacognitive cues shield against distraction in problem solving?

The question whether imagery is merely an incidental side-effect of processes of metaphor understanding or plays a key role in comprehension remains unresolved, with diametrically opposed views expressed among psychologists, philosophers, and literary theorists. I survey a wide array of evidence (behavioral and neurocognitive) concerning the activation and use of imagery in language processing generally and metaphor processing in particular. I conclude that mental imagery is not an essential component in the comprehension of language, whether literal or metaphorical, but it is often automatically activated in the minds of hearers or readers as a by-product of their linguistic and pragmatic processes. Writers may exploit this fact and enhance the impact of imagery by producing extended and/or creative metaphors, so that, although not essential, imagistic effects can be as significant as propositional cognitive effects. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Arzouan, Y., Goldstein, A., Faust, M., Brainwaves are stethoscopes: ERP correlates of novel metaphor comprehension (2007) Brain Research, 1160, pp. 69-81; Barsalou, L., Grounded cognition (2008) Annual Review of Psychology, 59, pp. 617-645; Barsalou, L., Santos, A., Simmons, W., Wilson, C., de Vega, M., Glenberg, A., Graesser, A., Language and simulation in conceptual processing (2008) Symbols and embodiment, pp. 245-284. , Oxford, UK: Oxford University Press, &,. &, (Eds; Barsalou, L., Simmons, W., Barbey, A., Wilson, C., Grounding conceptual knowledge in modality-specific systems (2003) Trends in Cognitive Sciences, 7 (2), pp. 84-91; Barsalou, L.W., On staying grounded and avoiding Quixotic dead ends (2016) Psychonomic Bulletin & Review, 23, pp. 1122-1142; Bermúdez, J., Cahen, A., Zalta, E.N., Nonconceptual mental content (2015) The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, , https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2015/entries/content-nonconceptual/, Fall 2015, Retrieved from, &,.

This article is a corpus linguistic analysis of the collocational patterns of metaphorical and non-metaphorical bridge instances from the Corpus of American English Corpus of Contemporary American English. The study shows that metaphorical and non-metaphorical uses of words are systematically linked to different types of real world experiences. It is argued that lexical metaphors are, in fact, lexico-encyclopedic conceptual metaphors (i.e., conceptual mappings that involve speakers’ understandings of specific target concepts by means of the specific source concepts that they refer to in metaphorical language), and that they are constrained by cognitive salience. © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Church, K.W., Hanks, P., Word association norms, mutual information, and lexicography (1990) Computational Linguistics, 16 (1), pp. 22-29; (2016), http://corpus.byu.edu/coca/, Retrieved from; Deignan, A., Linguistic metaphors and collocation in nonliterary corpus data (1999) Metaphor and Symbol, 14 (1), pp. 19-36; Deignan, A., (2005) Metaphor and corpus linguistics, 6. , Amsterdam: John Benjamins Publishing; Deignan, A., Image” metaphors and connotations in everyday language (2007) Annual Review of Cognitive Linguistics, 5 (1), pp. 173-192; Forceville, C., The Source–Path–Goal schema in the autobiographical journey documentary: McElwee, van der Keuken, Cole (2006) New Review of Film and Television Studies, 4 (3), pp. 241-261; Gibbs, R.W., Metaphor interpretation as embodied simulation (2006) Mind & Language, 21 (3), pp. 434-458; Gibbs, R.W., Santa Cruz, M.J., Temporal unfolding of conceptual metaphoric experience (2012) Metaphor and Symbol, 27 (4), pp. 299-311; Gibson, J.J., (2015) The ecological approach to visual perception: Classic edition, , New York, NY: Hove, East Sussex: Psychology Press; Grady, J.E., (1997) Foundations of meaning: Primary metaphors and primary scenes, , Berkeley, CA: University of California, Berkeley,.

In this article, we showed participants a series of “A is B” type metaphors that were either generated by humans or taken from the Twitter account “MetaphorIsMyBusiness” (@MetaphorMagnet), which is linked to a fully automated metaphor generator. We used these metaphors to assess linguistic factors that drive metaphor appreciation and understanding, including the role of novelty, word frequency, concreteness, and emotional valence of the topic and vehicle terms. We additionally assessed how these metaphors were understood in three languages, including English, Spanish, and Mandarin Chinese, and whether participants thought they had been generated by a human or a computer. We found that meaningfulness, appreciation, speed in finding meaning, and humanness ratings were reliably correlated with each other in all three languages, which we interpret to indicate a more general property of “metaphor quality.” We furthermore found that in all three languages, conventional metaphors and those that contained an “optimal” (intermediate) degree of novelty were more likely to be perceived to be of higher quality than those that were extremely creative. Further analysis of the English data alone revealed that those metaphors that contained negatively valenced vehicle words and infrequent vehicle terms (in comparison with the topic terms) were more likely to be considered high-quality metaphors. We discuss the implications of these findings for the (improvement of) automatic generation of metaphor by computers, for the persuasive function of metaphor, and for theories of metaphor understanding more generally. © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Baayen, R.H., Davidson, D.J., Bates, D.M., Mixed-effects modeling with crossed random effects for subjects and items (2008) Journal of Memory and Language, 59, pp. 390-412; Barnden, J., Besold, T.R., Schorlemmer, M., Smaill, A., Open-ended elaborations in creative metaphor (2015) Computational creativity research: Towards creative machines, pp. 217-242. , Amsterdam, The Netherlands: Atlantis Press,.

Our study reveals that experiential comparisons of different kinds (Trying not to tic is like trying not to blink) feature prominently as means of conveying such experiences. We identify a number of meaning domains that are recruited in correspondences between sources and targets, including motion and force, and detail how sensory modalities, bodily sensations, and emotions are exploited to evoke emotive/sensory responses in readers. We conclude that comparative construal is a significant communicative strategy precisely because it elicits familiar situational meanings capable of evoking vicarious experiences in readers. By considering texts from actual uses of language in natural situations, our research sheds new light on how emotive/sensory experiences are conveyed through language and furthers our understanding of means of effecting emotive/sensory descriptions beyond individual words. An explanatory framework for comparative construal is proposed—a three-dimensional similarity space—which accounts for such construal in terms of the nature of correspondences between sources and targets and intersubjective evaluation in the form of experiential, embodied simulation. © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,"Vetenskapsrådet: 349-2007-8695

We provide data from quantitative narrative analyses (QNA) of the altogether 464 metaphors on over 70 variables, including surface features like metaphor length, phonological features like sonority score, or syntactic-semantic features like sentence similarity. In a first computational study using machine learning tools (i.e., a classifier of the decision tree family) we show that Katz et al.’s literary metaphors can be successfully discriminated from their nonliterary ones on the basis of response measures (10 ratings), in particular the ratings for familiarity, ease of interpretation, semantic relatedness, and comprehensibility. A second computational study then shows that the classifier can reliably detect and predict between-group differences on the basis of five QNA features generalizing from a training to a test corpus. Our results shed light on surface and semantic features that co-determine the reception of metaphors and raise important questions about their literariness, aptness or poetic potential. They tentatively suggest a set of 11 features that could influence the “literariness” of metaphors, including their sonority score, length and surprisal value. © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Aryani, A., Jacobs, A.M., Conrad, M., Extracting salient sublexical units from written texts: “Emophon,” a corpus-based approach to phonological iconicity (2013) Frontiers in Psychology, 4, p. 654; Aryani, A., Kraxenberger, M., Ullrich, S., Jacobs, A.M., Conrad, M., Measuring the basic affective tone of poems via phonological saliency and iconicity (2016) Psychology of Aesthetics, Creativity, and the Arts, 10, pp. 191-204; Berlyne, D.E., (1971) Aesthetics and psychobiology, , New York, NY: Appleton-Century-Crofts; Bestgen, Y., Vincze, N., Checking and boot-strapping lexical norms by means of word similarity indexes (2012) Behavior Research Methods, 44 (4), pp. 998-1006; Bird, S., Klein, E., Loper, E., (2009) Natural language processing with Python, , Sebastopol, CA: O’Reilly Media; Bohrn, I.C., Altmann, U., Lubrich, O., Menninghaus, W., Jacobs, A.M., When we like what we know—A parametric fMRI analysis of beauty and familiarity (2013) Brain and Language, 124, pp. 1-8; Braun, M., Hutzler, F., Ziegler, J.C., Dambacher, M., Jacobs, A.M., Pseudo homophone effects provide evidence of early lexico-phonological processing in visual word recognition (2009) Human Brain Mapping, 30 (7), pp. 1977-1989; Cardillo, E.R., Schmidt, G.L., Kranjec, A., Chatterjee, A., Stimulus design is an obstacle course: 560 matched literal and metaphorical sentences for testing neural hypotheses about metaphor (2010) Behavior Research Methods, 42, pp. 651-664; Cardillo, E.R., Watson, C., Chatterjee, A., Stimulus needs are a moving target: 240 additional matched literal and metaphorical sentences for testing neural hypotheses about metaphor (2017) Behavioral Researcher, 49, p. 471; Chiappe, D.L., Chiappe, P., The role of working memory in metaphor production and comprehension (2007) Journal of Memory and Language, 56, pp. 172-188; Clements, G.N., Kingston, J., Beckman, M.E., The role of sonority in core syllabification (1990) Papers in laboratory phonology I.

Why are warfare metaphors so common, and what are the potential benefits and costs to using them to frame important social and political issues? We address these questions in a detailed case study by reviewing the empirical literature on the subject and by advancing our own theoretical account of the structure and function of war metaphors in public discourse. We argue that war metaphors are omnipresent because (a) they draw on basic and widely shared schematic knowledge that efficiently structures our ability to reason and communicate about many different types of situations, and (b) they reliably express an urgent, negatively valenced emotional tone that captures attention and motivates action. Nevertheless, we find that the meaning (and consequences) of war metaphors is intimately tied to the context in which they are used, which may result in either positive or negative outcomes, depending on the situation. Thus, blanket statements about whether or not a war frame is useful are misguided or overly constraining. Here we situate our case study results in relation to popular theories of metaphoric representation and processing and offer some guidelines for using a war framing effectively. This work helps illuminate the complex, dynamic, and nuanced functions of metaphor in cognition in general, and in public discourse in particular. © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Alexandrescu, L., Mephedrone, assassin of youth: The rhetoric of fear in contemporary drug scares (2014) Crime, Media, Culture, 10 (1), pp. 23-37; Almond, D., Hoynes, H.W., Schanzenbach, D.W., Inside the war on poverty: The impact of food stamps on birth outcomes (2011) The Review of Economics and Statistics, 93 (2), pp. 387-403; Andréani, G., The “War on Terror”: Good cause, wrong concept (2004) Survival, 46 (4), pp. 31-50; Annas, G.J., Reframing the debate on health care reform by replacing our metaphors (1995) New England Journal of Medicine, 332 (11), pp. 745-748; Asplund, T., Metaphors in climate discourse: An analysis of Swedish farm magazines (2011) Journal of Science Communication, 10 (4), pp. 1-8; Audebrand, L.K., Sustainability in strategic management education: The quest for new root metaphors (2010) Academy of Management Learning & Education, 9 (3), pp. 413-428; Bartolucci, V., Terrorism rhetoric under the Bush administration: Discourses and effects (2012) Journal of Language and Politics, 11 (4), pp. 562-582; Bartolucci, V., Gallo, G., Terrorism, system thinking and critical discourse analysis (2015) Systems Research and Behavioral Science, 32 (1), pp. 15-27; Bingham, A., Afghanistan war by the numbers: Lives lost, billions spent (2012) ABC News, , http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/OTUS/billionsdollars-thousands-lives-lost-afghanistan-war/story?id=16256292, May, Retrieved from; Blank, G.D., Metaphors in the lexicon (1988) Metaphor and Symbol, 3 (3), pp. 21-36; Boroditsky, L., Metaphoric structuring: Understanding time through spatial metaphors (2000) Cognition, 75 (1), pp. 1-28; Bowdle, B.F., Gentner, D., The career of metaphor (2005) Psychological Review, 112 (1), pp. 193-216; Bryan, B., (2017) GOP lawmaker uses bizarre goat metaphor for Obamacare while arguing for repeal, , http://www.businessinsider.com/obamacare-goat-drew-ferguson-repeal-replace-2017-1, January, Retrieved from; Cahn, E.S., Cahn, J.C., The war on poverty: A civilian perspective (1964) The Yale Law Journal, 73, pp. 1317-1352; Cassidy, J., (2014) How the war on poverty succeeded (in four charts), , http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/how-the-war-on-poverty-succeeded-in-four-charts, January, Retrieved from; Cespedes, F.V., (2014) Stop using battle metaphors in your company strategy, , https://hbr.org/2014/12/stop-using-battle-metaphors-in-your-company-strategy, December, Retrieved from; Chapman, S., (2017) Opioid epidemic: Another drug war failure, , http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/opinion/chapman/ct-jeff-sessions-opioids-drugs-perspec-0319-md-20170317-column.html, March, Retrieved from; Chiang, W.-Y., Duann, R.-F., Conceptual metaphors for sars: “War” between whom?

Previous research has shown that numerous cultural and individual factors underpinning temporal focus may contribute to the direction of space–time mappings in people’s mental models. However, the role of time of day in shaping spatial conceptions of time has not been investigated. In a series of three experiments, Chinese participants, who were more likely to be future-focused in the morning than afternoon, were also more likely to produce a future-in-front mapping. However, this morning future-minded effect can only be found in morning people, suggesting a mediating role of chronotype processes. Taken together, the findings across studies suggest that people’s representations of time may arise from an interaction between a person’s chronotype and time-of-day, a phenomenon that we refer to as the chronotype future-minded effect. © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,"National Key Basic Research Program For Youth: 2014CB340502

In the first study, twenty varieties of anger lexicalized in three languages (English, Russian, and Spanish) are characterized using the Metaphorical Profile Approach, a quantitative corpus-based assessment of the meaning of emotion words in metaphorical contexts. In the second study, the same set of lexemes is analyzed using a psycholinguistic feature-rating instrument adapted to the study of near-synonyms. Our results demonstrate congruence of the two methods in unveiling the internal organization of the anger family of terms in each language, and the reasons for this organization. In particular, the metaphorical and the feature-based profiles provide consistent insight about variation in bodily heat, expressiveness, regulation, action tendencies (aggression and drive to act), regulation, and the temporal characteristics of anger experiences. To conclude, we discuss the mutual complementarity of the two profiling methodologies and their relevance for a wider research context. © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,"Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur FÃ¶rderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung, SNSF: 51NF40-104897

We find that after reading lists of sentences based on underlying conceptual metaphors that participants are more likely to falsely remember the nonpresented conceptual metaphors themselves as well as new sentences consistent with the CM mapping than control items that do not share this mapping.

The study focuses on size and weight adjectives in both languages and on linguistic evidence in two areas: their lexicalizations of the importance senses as found in the dictionaries, and their roles in the instantiation of the two primary metaphors in natural discourse as found in the corpora. Our further analysis also shows that the primary metaphors can be manifested without explicit use of size and weight words when relevant conceptual frames in the source, evoked by other words or images, are mapped onto the target domain, thus activating the relevant region of our encyclopedic knowledge and triggering off the primary metaphors in our conceptual system. We also construct a hypothetical mapping scheme for primary metaphors based on the OBJECT image schema, in which OBJECT is mapped onto its target via three of its fundamental dimensions: SIZE, WEIGHT, and SOLIDITY. It is hoped that this mapping scheme will benefit future comparative studies of primary metaphors across languages and cultures in a more systematic way. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Ackerman, J.M., Nocera, C.C., Bargh, J.A., Incidental haptic sensations influence social judgments and decision (2010) Science, 328, pp. 1712-1715; Barcelona, A., On the plausibility of claiming a metonymic motivation for conceptual metaphor (2000) Metaphor and metonymy at the crossroads: A cognitive perspective, pp. 31-58. , Barcelona A., (ed), Berlin, Germany: Mouton de Gruyter,.

We focus on the framing of wildfires as monsters, seen in statements such as “Monster wildfire rages in Colorado” and “Two monster wildfires in Northern California are slowly being tamed,” which reflect a “wildfire is monster” metaphor. Study 1 analyzes how and when this phrase is used in TV news reports of wildfires, and Study 2A and Study 2B investigate how it influences reasoning about risks associated with wildfire. The results show that metaphor is widely used in framing news reports about significant wildfires, and that its use influences how people reason about them.

Despite recent calls for theoretical accounts to include the factors that influence irony interpretation, few studies have examined the individual differences that may impact verbal irony interpretation. The present study examined whether adults with elevated shyness would generate more negative interpretations of ironic statements. University students with varying degrees of shyness listened to stories (accompanied by comics) wherein one character made literal or ironic criticisms or compliments to another character. Participants then appraised each speaker’s belief and attitude. Self-reported shyness did not predict comprehension of the counterfactual nature of ironic statements. However, shyer adults rated speakers who made ironic compliments as being meaner than did adults low in shyness. Thus, while understanding that ironic speakers intended to communicate their true beliefs, shyer individuals construed the social meaning of irony more negatively. Such interpretive biases may lead shy individuals to more frequently take offense at ironic compliments and experience more negativity in social interactions. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,"Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada, SSHRC

Everest Academy, United States; Keefer, L.A., University of Southern Mississippi, United States","In America, White and affluent middle-school students outperform minority students and those of low socioeconomic status on measures of academic performance. This achievement gap is partly attributable to differences in academic engagement. A promising strategy for engaging students is to elicit an academic possible identity: an image of oneself in the future as an accomplished student. Tests of this strategy’s efficacy show mixed results, however. According to Identity-Based Motivation Theory, this is because a salient possible identity enhances goal engagement when it is perceived to be strongly (vs. weakly) connected to one’s current identity. Still, the connection between temporally remote identities is an abstract concept that students may have difficulty grasping. According to Conceptual Metaphor Theory, this connection may be easier to conceptualize metaphorically in terms of a dissimilar concrete experience–in particular, a physical journey between locations. Integrating these theories, prior studies show that priming a journey-metaphoric framing of an academic possible identity increased academic engagement among college students. The current study tested whether this prime would similarly motivate middle-school students in an economically disadvantaged school setting. Results show that students (Agemedian = 13) framing their academic possible identity as a destination on a physical path (n = 30), versus without a provided metaphor (n = 30), reported higher academic engagement. This finding extends metaphor priming effects to low-income and minority adolescents, a crucial population in educational research, and points to low-cost, theoretically grounded interventions for boosting academic engagement. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,"National Science Foundation, NSF: BCS-1222047","This material is based on work supported by the National Science Foundation under Grant Number BCS-1222047.",,"Anderman, E.M., Mueller, C., Middle school transitions and adolescent development (2010) Handbook of research on schools, schooling, and human development, , Meece J.L., Eccles J.S., (eds), New York, NY: Routledge, &,.

Nevertheless, how food metaphors are realized through the actual dining experience remains unexplored. Based on a food design event called EATAIPEI that took place in the London Design Festival in 2015, one aimed at promoting Taipei as World Design Capital 2016, this article analyzes how the multimodal metaphors of food were creatively represented and elaborated within it. This study proposes an analytical framework that combines insights from cognitive linguistics with an intercultural performative view of food presentation and food metaphor. More specifically, it treats complex metaphors as resulting from the interactions of primary metaphors, proposition schemas and intercultural performance (i.e., adapting shared or culture-specific knowledge about food to international audiences). The multimodal metaphors of food are complex metaphors composed of combined sets of primary metaphors, enriched by schema propositions and embedded within food performance (e.g., transformation of traditional foods, display tools or stands on the table, and the eating experience itself). The experience of eating in the event reactivates the sensorimotor experiences that underpin the complex metaphors. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Barcelona, A., On the plausibility of claiming a metonymic motivation for conceptual metaphor (2000) Metaphor and metonymy at the crossroads, pp. 32-58. , Barcelona A., (ed), Berlin, Germany: Mouton de Gruyter; Fauconnier, G., Turner, M., (2002) The way we think: Conceptual blending and the mind’s hidden complexities, , New York, NY: Basic Books; Gibbs, R., Cameron, L., The social-cognitive dynamics of metaphor performance (2008) Cognitive Systems Research, 9, pp. 64-75; Grady, J., Johnson, C., Converging evidence for the notions of subscene and primary scene (2002) Metaphor and metonymy in comparison and contrast, pp. 533-554. , Dirven R., Pörings R., (eds), Berlin, Germany and New York, NY: Mouton de Gruyter; Grady, J.E., Theories are buildings revisited (1997) Cognitive Linguistics, 8 (4), pp. 267-290; Grady, J.E., (1997) Foundations of meaning: primary metaphors and primary scenes, , Unpublished doctoral dissertation, University of California, Berkeley:; Grady, J.E., A typology of motivation for conceptual metaphor: Correlation vs. resemblance (1999) Metaphor in cognitive linguistics, pp. 79-100. , Gibbs Jr. R.W., Steen G., (eds), Amsterdam, the Netherlands: John Benjamins; Grady, J.E., Primary metaphors as inputs to conceptual integration (2005) Journal of Pragmatics, 37, pp. 1595-1614; Hidalgo-Downing, L., Metaphor and metonymy (2016) The Routledge handbook of language and creativity, pp. 107-128. , Jones R.H., (ed), London, England and New York, NY: Routledge; Hiraga, M.K., Food for thought: CONDUIT versus FOOD metaphors for communication (2009) Language in life and a life in language: Jacob Mey—A festschriftn, pp. 175-181. , Fraser B., Turner K., (eds), Bingley, England: Emerald; Holland, D., Quinn, N., (1987) Cultural models in language and thought, , Cambridge, England: Cambridge University Press; Hutchins, E., (1980) Culture and inference, , Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press; Johnson, C., Metaphor vs. conflation in the acquisition of polysemy: The case of SEE (1990) Cultural, typological, and psychological issues in cognitive linguistics, pp. 155-169. , Hiraga M.K., Sinha C., Wilcox S., (eds), Amsterdam, the Netherlands: John Benjamins; Khajeh, Z., Imran-Ho, A., Persian culinary metaphor: A cross-cultural conceptualization (2012) GEMA Onlinetm Journal of Language Studies, 12 (1), pp. 69-87; Kirshenblatt-Gimblett, B., Playing to the senses: Food as a performance medium (1999) Performance Research: A Journal of the Performing Arts, 4 (1), pp. 1-30; Kövecses, Z., American friendship and the scope of metaphor (1995) Cognitive Linguistics, 6 (4), pp. 315-346; Kövecses, Z., (2005) Metaphor in culture: Universality and variation, , Cambridge, England: Cambridge University Press; Kövecses, Z., (2010) Metaphor: A practical introduction, , 2nd, Oxford, England: Oxford University Press; Kövecses, Z., The metaphor-metonymy relationship: Correlation metaphors are based on metonymy (2013) Metaphor & Symbol, 28 (2), pp. 75-88; Lakoff, G., Johnson, G., (1980) Metaphors we live by, , Chicago, IL: University of Chicago Press; Lakoff, G., Johnson, M., (1999) Philosophy in the flesh: The embodied mind and its challenge to western thought, , New York, NY: Basic Books; Liu, D.-L., (2002) Metaphor, culture, and worldview: The case of American English and the Chinese language, , Lanham, MD: University Press of America; Ortiz, M.J., Visual rhetoric: Primary metaphors and symmetric object alignment (2010) Metaphor and Symbol, 25 (3), pp. 162-180; Ortiz, M.J., Primary metaphors and monomodal visual metaphors (2011) Journal of Pragmatics, 43, pp. 1568-1580; Ortiz, M.J., Visual manifestations of primary metaphors through mise-en-scène techniques (2014) Image [&] Narrative, 15 (1), pp. 5-16; Quinn, N., Convergent evidence for a cultural model of American marriage (1987) Cultural models in language and thought, pp. 173-192. , Holland D., Quinn N., (eds), Cambridge, England: Cambridge University Press; Reddy, M., The conduit metaphor: A case of frame conflict in our language about language (1979) Metaphor and thought, pp. 284-310. , Ortony A., (ed), Cambridge, England: Cambridge University Press; Su, L.I.W., What can metaphors tell us about culture?

Three distinctly well-motivated research strands with underexplored overlaps: (a) the theoretical relationship between metaphor and the body, (b) the use and management of metaphors in therapy, and (c) the body as a therapeutic resource complementing verbal interaction, are first described. Taking a practitioner-informed approach called “correspondent analysis,” which combines the methods and insights of the metaphor researcher and psychotherapist, a series of session extracts are then analyzed to illustrate the connections between the three strands and what they imply for both metaphor research and therapeutic practice. This culminates in the proposal of a triangle model for the metaphor–body–psychotherapy relationship, with wider implications for applied metaphor research also discussed. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Avdi, E., Georgaca, E., Discourse analysis and psychotherapy: A critical review (2007) European Journal of Psychotherapy, Counselling & Health, 9 (2), pp. 157-176; Blenkiron, P., (2010) Stories and analogies in cognitive behaviour therapy, , West Sussex, UK: John Wiley & Sons; Cameron, L., Maslen, R., (2010) Metaphor analysis, , London, UK: Equinox; Carlo, O., Gelo, G., Salcuni, S., Colli, A., Text analysis within quantitative and qualitative psychotherapy process research (2012) Introduction to Special Issue, 15 (2), pp. 45-53; Cashdan, S., (1988) Object relations therapy: Using the relationship, , New York, NY: W.W.Norton; Cirillo, L., Crider, C., Distinctive therapeutic uses of metaphor (1995) Psychotherapy, 32, pp. 511-519; Cooper, M., Embodied empathy (2001) Rogers’ therapeutic conditions: Evolution, theory and practice.

It is shown that interrelating both film-analytic approaches provides a deeper and more comprehensive insight into how figurative thought influences psycho-cognitive processes in the moviegoer’s mind as they dynamically unfold in their cinematic contexts. Evidence is provided that Kappelhoff and co-workers’ proposal can be complemented and enriched by psychocinematics findings on the allocation of visual attention and eye fixation, motion and image frame sensing, and mental activity underlying emotional and diagetic experiences. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Atkinson, P., Turning away: Embodied movement in the perception of shot duration (2004) Image & Narrative, 15 (1), pp. 89-101; Barrett, L., Variety is the spice of life: A psychological construction approach to understanding variability in emotion (2009) Cognition & Emotion, 23 (7), pp. 1284-1306; Bordwell, D., (2005) Figures traced in light: On cinematic staging, , Berkeley: California University Press; Bordwell, D., The part-time cognitivist: A view from film studies (2010) Projections, 4 (2), pp. 1-18; Bordwell, D., The Viewer’s Share: Models of Mind in Explaining Film (2013) Psychocinematics.

A natural key element of poetic language, metaphor, still is understudied insofar as relatively little empirical research looked at literary or poetic metaphors. An exception is Katz et al.’s corpus of 204 literary metaphors by authors such as Shakespeare or Dylan Thomas, for which various rating data are available. We reanalyzed their corpus using a combination of quantitative narrative analysis, latent semantic analysis, and machine learning in order to identify relevant features of the metaphors that influenced the ratings. The combined application of computational tools sheds light on surface and affective-semantic features that co-determine the reception of poetic metaphors and successfully predicted the period of origin (i.e., early vs. late), authorship (e.g., Byron vs. Donne) and goodness ratings of the metaphors. The present results can be used for generating quantitative hypotheses or selecting and matching verbal stimuli in empirical studies of literature and neurocognitive poetics. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Altarriba, J., Bauer, L.M., Benvenuto, C., Concreteness, context availability, and image ability ratings and word associations for abstract, concrete, and emotion words (1999) Behavior Research Methods, 31 (4), pp. 578-602; Altmann, U., Bohrn, I.C., Lubrich, O., Menninghaus, W., Jacobs, A.M., The power of emotional valence-from cognitive to affective processes in reading (2012) Frontiers Human Neuroscience, 6, p. 192; Altmann, U., Bohrn, I.C., Lubrich, O., Menninghaus, W., Jacobs, A.M., Fact vs fiction-how paratextual information shapes our reading processes (2014) Social Cognition Affect Neuroscience, 9, pp. 22-29; Amsel, B.D., Urbach, T.P., Kutas, M., Perceptual and motor attribute ratings for 559 object concepts (2012) Behavior Research Methods; Anderson, G.K., Walton, E.L., (1939) This generation: A selection of British and American literature from 1914 to the present, , Glenview, IL: Scott Foresman; Aryani, A., Kraxenberger, M., Ullrich, S., Jacobs, A.M., Conrad, M., Measuring the basic affective tone of poems via phonological saliency and iconicity (2016) Psychology of Aesthetics, Creativity, and the Arts, 10, pp. 191-204; Barnstone, W., Terry, P., Friar, K., Raiziss, S., De Palchi, A., Reavey, G., Flores, A., (1966) Modern European poetry, , New York, NY: Bantam; Beardsley, M.C., (1958) Aesthetics, problems in the philosophy of criticism, , New York, NY: Harcourt Brace & Co; Beardsley, M.C., The metaphorical twist (1962) Philosophy and Phenomenological Research, 22, pp. 293-307; Bestgen, Y., Vincze, N., Checking and boot- strapping lexical norms by means of word similarity indexes (2012) Behavior Research Methods, 44 (4), pp. 998-1006; Billow, R., Metaphor: A review of the psychological literature (1977) Psychological Bulltin, 84, pp. 81-92; Black, M., More on metaphor (1977) Dialectica, 31, pp. 431-457; Blasko, D., Only the tip of the iceberg: Who understands what about metaphor?

Using a corpus-assisted approach to the identification and analysis of metaphors supported by Wmatrix, this study attempts to establish empirically whether promotion of destinations culturally and geographically faraway does deploy more metaphors than marketing of tourist places “closer” to home and what kind of conceptual mappings and metaphorical expressions are utilized. The results point to a significant increase of metaphor use in the descriptions of tropical destinations. Five domains—“BODY,” “NATURAL PRECIOUS ELEMENT,”“COLOR,” “TASTE,” and “RELIGION”—prove especially productive. The combinations of metaphorical expressions from these domains generate sensory fusions that appeal to multiple senses at once including vision, taste and imagination, and in doing so, potentially increase the “appetite” for “consuming” a destination. They also perform ideological work as devices in discourse that clandestinely perpetuates colonial legacies. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Abuczki, A., The use of metaphors in advertising.

What, then, is an effective strategy for counteracting a metaphor’s influence? One could ignore or criticize the metaphor, emphasizing strong counterarguments directly pertaining to the target issue. Yet if observers rely on it to understand a complicated issue, they may be reluctant to abandon it. In this case, a “metaphor extension” strategy may be effective: Encourage observers to retain the metaphor but reinterpret its meaning by considering other, less obvious implications. The current studies support this claim. Under conditions where participants gained a strong (versus weak) epistemic benefit from a rhetorical metaphor, they were more persuaded by a rebuttal that extended (versus ignored or criticized) that metaphor. The studies use converging operational definitions of epistemic benefit and offer insight into how political attitudes are made and unmade. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,"National Science Foundation, NSF: BCS-1222047","This material is based on work supported by the National Science Foundation under Grant Number BCS-1222047.",,"Alter, A.L., Oppenheimer, D.M., Uniting the tribes of fluency to form a metacognitive nation (2009) Personality and Social Psychology Review, 13, pp. 219-235; Boehner, J., (2013) Speaker Boehner: Every family must balance its budget, Washington should too, , http://www.speaker.gov/video/speaker-boehner-every-family-must-balance-its-budget-washington-should-too, March, Retrieved from; Bosman, J., Hagendoorn, L., Effects of literal and metaphorical persuasive messages (1991) Metaphor and Symbolic Activity, 6, pp. 271-292; Chaiken, S., Heuristic versus systematic information processing and the use of source versus message cues in persuasion (1980) Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 39, pp. 752-766; Charteris-Black, J., (2011) Politics and rhetoric: The persuasive power of metaphor, , 2nd ed., New York, NY: Palgrave Macmillan; Coulson, S., (2006) Semantic leaps: Frame-shifting and conceptual blending in meaning construction, , New York, NY: Cambridge University Press; Fabrigar, L.R., Petty, R.E., The role of the affective and cognitive bases of attitudes in susceptibility to affectively and cognitively based persuasion (1999) Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, 25, pp. 363-381; Gibbs, R.W., (1994) The poetics of mind: Figurative thought, language, and understanding, , New York, NY: Cambridge University Press; Gilovich, T., Seeing the past in the present: The effect of associations to familiar events on judgments and decisions (1981) Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 40, pp. 797-808; Hanne, M., Crano, W.D., Mio, J.S., (2014) Warring with words: Narrative and metaphor in politics, , New York, NY: Psychology Press; Hargreaves, S., (2013) Fed sets road map for end of stimulus, , http://www.money.cnn.com, June, Retrieved, from; Hodge, C., Indecision on gays for the boy scouts (2013) Times Video, , http://www.nytimes.com/video/us/100000002049383/indecision-on-gays-for-the-boy-scouts.html?emc=eta1, February, Retrieved from; Jia, L., Smith, E.R., Distance makes the metaphor grow stronger: A psychological distance model of metaphor use (2013) Journal of Experimental Social Psychology, 49, pp. 492-497; Johnson, M., (1987) The body in the mind: The bodily basis of meaning, imagination, and reason, , Chicago, IL: University of Chicago Press; Keefer, L., Landau, M.J., Rothschild, Z., Sullivan, D., Exploring metaphor’s epistemic function: Uncertainty moderates metaphor-consistent priming effects on social perceptions (2011) Journal of Experimental Social Psychology, 47, pp. 657-660; Koller, V., (2004) Metaphor and gender in business media discourse: A clinical cognitive study, , New York, NY: Palgrave; Kövecses, Z., (2010) Metaphor: A practical introduction, , New York, NY: Oxford University Press; Kruglanski, A.W., Crenshaw, M., Post, J.M., Victoroff, J., What should this fight be called?

The current article reports a systematic literature review (N = 109) that examines whether these approaches report converging or diverging effects. We compared CDA and REA on the metaphorical frames that were studied and their reported effects. Results show that the CDA frames are typically more negative, nonfictional, and extreme than REA frames. Reported effects in CDA and REA studies differ in terms of presence, directionality, and strength, with CDA typically reporting strong effects in line with the frame, compared to REA. These differences in effects can be (partly) explained by the different frame characteristics. However, differences in the methods applied by CDA and REA could be (partly) responsible for these differences as well. In all, we conclude that the research field is fragmented on the impact of metaphors in politics. ©, Published with license by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC © 2017 Amber Boeynaems, Christian Burgers, Elly A.

We provide an empirical demonstration. In Study 1, participants silently read a set of ambiguous phrases as either being sarcastic or sincere, and chose from a set of adjectives those that best describe the tone of voice that was invoked. Sarcasm-discriminating and sincere-discriminating adjectives were identified. In Study 2, a different sample read a set of phrases in a minimal discourse context. The critical phrase (e.g., “isn’t she friendly”) was preceded by one of three contexts: positive (to invite a sincere reading), negative (to invite a sarcastic reading), and an ambiguous context that could invoke either a sincere or sarcastic reading. Following each scenario participants were asked to rate a set of adjectives as to the extent the adjective was mentally heard during silent reading: the adjectives were a subset of those that were sarcasm-discriminating, sincere-discriminating (as determined in Study 1) or a set of adjectives irrelevant to tone of voice. As predicted, even when not instructed to think sarcastically, participants rated most highly those adjectives chosen as associated with a sarcastic tone of voice in the negative context and least in the positive context. Analogously, the opposite effect was observed for sincere-discriminating items: rated as most applicable to what is being heard internally for positive contexts and rated lowest in negative contexts.

The research provides an analysis of the lexical characteristics of a single item (grew) when used in potentially, but not clearly identified, metaphoric contexts. The analysis focuses on flexible patterns of meaning and the relationship between metaphor and other aspects of figurative language such as polysemy, metonymy, and meronymy. The research stands as a follow up to a larger corpus-driven study that found differences in the lexical behavior of clearly defined metaphoric and nonmetaphoric instances of items (flame, cultivated, and grew), when looking at a large set of collocations, colligations, and semantic, pragmatic and textual associations. These behaviors or patterns are consequently avoided by the non-metaphoric instances of that same item, in order to avoid ambiguity. In the case of more ambiguous or unclear cases of metaphor, this article aims to determine if these patterns are still visible and the extent to which they signal metaphoricity. Evidence of such patterns would imply that lexical, grammatical, textual, and pragmatic manifestations in language play an important role in distinguishing between subtleties in word senses and meanings, even in the case of less obvious metaphoricity. As a consequence, awareness of these behaviors or characteristics (or lexical primings) should be at the forefront of any lexical metaphor theory. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Deignan, A., (2005) Metaphor and corpus linguistics, , Amsterdam, the Netherlands: John Benjamins; Deignan, A., Littlemore, J., Semino, E., (2013) Figurative language, genre and register, , Cambridge, England: Cambridge University Press; Deignan, A., Semino, E., Corpus techniques for metaphor (2010) Metaphor analysis: research practice in applied linguistics, social sciences and the humanities, , Cameron L., Maslen R., (eds), London, England: Equinox; Gibbs, R.W., Jr., (1994) The poetics of mind, , Cambridge, England: Cambridge University Press; Giora, R., (2003) On our mind: salience, context and figurative language, , Oxford, England:: Oxford University Press; Handl, S., (2011) The conventionality of Figurative Language, , Narr Verlag, Tubingen:; Hanks, P., The syntagmatics of metaphor (2004) International Journal of Lexicography, 17 (3), pp. 254-274; Hanks, P., The lexicographical legacy of John Sinclair (2008) International Journal of Lexicography, 21 (3), pp. 219-229; Hanks, P., (2013) Lexical analysis: Norms and exploitations, , London, England: John Benjamins; Hoey, M., (2005) Lexical priming: A new theory of words and language, , London, England: Routledge; Koller, V., Of critical importance: Using corpora to study metaphor in business media discourse (2006) Corpus-Based Approaches to Metaphor and Metonymy: Trends in Linguistics.

Previous research has shown that objects that are mentioned in a simile construction (X is like Y) are represented as similarly shaped. The present study examined object shape in mental representations of negated similes (X is NOT like Y). In our experiment participants read negated similes or control sentences without a comparison structure. After having read the sentence, they judged whether two presented objects, which were either similarly or dissimilarly shaped, were previously mentioned. Our findings showed that for the negated similes, verification latencies were shorter for similarly shaped than for dissimilarly shaped objects. This shows that the expected situation (without the negation marker), rather than the actual situation is represented. For the control sentences, we did not find such an effect of similarity in shape. We discuss our findings in the light of processing theories of negation and comparison. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,"Israel Science Foundation, ISF: 436/12","This research was supported by the Israel Science Foundation (grant no. 436/12) to Rachel Giora.",,"Barsalou, L.W., Perceptual symbol systems (1999) Behavioral and Brain Sciences, 22, pp. 577-660; Connell, L., Representing object colour in language comprehension (2007) Cognition, 102, pp. 476-485; Desmarais, G., Dixon, M.J., Roy, E.A., A role for action knowledge in visual object identification (2007) Memory & Cognition, 35 (7), pp. 1712-1723; Gentner, D., Structure-mapping: A theoretical framework for analogy (1983) CognitiveScience, 7, pp. 155-170; Gentner, D., Clement, C., Evidence for relational selectivity in the interpretation of analogy and metaphor (1988) The psychology of learning and motivation: Advances in research and theory, , Bower G.H., (ed), New York, NY: Academic Press; Gentner, D., Markman, A.B., Structural alignment in comparison: No difference without similarity (1994) Psychological Science, 5, pp. 152-158; Giora, R., Anything negatives can do affirmatives can do just as well, except for some metaphors (2006) Journal of Pragmatics, 38, pp. 981-1014; Giora, R., Heruti, V., Metuki, N., Fein, O., When we say no we mean no: On negation in vision and language (2009) Journal of Pragmatics, 41, pp. 2222-2239; Hasson, U., Glucksberg, S., Does understanding negation entail affirmation?

The attempt is to expand the notion of Optimal Innovation to allow it to apply to both stimuli’s coded meanings as well as their noncoded, constructed interpretations. According to the Optimal Innovation Hypothesis, Optimal Innovations, when devised (KNOW HOPE), will be more pleasing than nonoptimally innovative counterparts (No hope). Unlike such competitors, Optimal Innovations (KNOW HOPE) deautomatize familiar coded alternatives (No hope), which invoke unconditional responses (“despair”) alongside novel but distinct ones (“optimism”), allowing both responses to interact. Conversely, the Revised Optimal Innovation Hypothesis, introduced and tested here, follows from the Defaultness Hypothesis (Giora et al., 2015b). It posits that both default lexicalized meanings and default constructed interpretations might be qualifiable for Optimal Innovation once they are deautomatized by nondefault, context-dependent counterparts. Such nondefault Optimal Innovations (e.g., the affirmative sarcastic exclamation The most organized student, describing a messy student) will be pleasing, more pleasing than default and nondefault counterparts not qualifiable for Optimal Innovation (e.g., the default negative sarcastic exclamation Not the most organized student, describing a messy student). Results of two experiments support the Revised Optimal Innovation Hypothesis, while further corroborating the Defaultness Hypothesis. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,"Israel Science Foundation, ISF: 436/12","This research was supported by the Israel Science Foundation (grant no. 436/12) to Rachel Giora.",,"Balter, T., (2009) A theory of irony in music: Types of irony in the string quartets of Haydn and Beethoven.

Two types of the entity metaphor were distinguished: “cross-modal entity metaphor” and “gesture-only entity metaphor.” For the former, the metaphor was expressed by metaphorical speech and the object gesture simultaneously. Among all of the 67 cross-modal instances, a wide variety of idea was represented as referring, characterizing, and quantifying referents in speech. Manually, the object gesture was configured in numerous ways. The way the object gesture was configured reveals the facet of the metaphorical conceptualization the speaker focuses on during speaking, and the details about the real-time thinking of a metaphorical object in discourse. For the gesture-only entity metaphor, it was manifested in the single modality of gesture. Among all of the 73 gesture-only instances, the object gesture depicted a stretch of talk as discrete object mainly by configuring a spatial boundary with curled fingers. Metaphor of this type attests that the thinking of phrasal-clausal ideas as entities is as common as that of lexical ideas as entities in conversation. Importantly, the object gesture bears out the emergence of a phrasal or clausal idea being conceptualized as object in natural discourse.

The corpus is made up of 128 pseudonyms produced by Saudis over mass and social media. The argument runs as follows: Pseudonym Bearers use metaphor and/or metonymy as an Instrument to construct a pseudonymous frame to mask their identity. Sociocultural reality, which is called the Trigger of the frame, is the motivation behind conceptualizing the self via a pseudonym. The Goal of the pseudonym is to change the Trigger and Benefit psychologically from this change. To measure this change of reality, the researchers submit the pseudonyms under study to Lakoff and Turner’s Great Chain of Being Metaphor. The findings of the article point to a scaling of the Bearer down the Chain, thus re-categorizing the self as less than human. These findings will be shown to occasion possible theoretical implications for the contemporary theory of metaphor. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.",,,,,,,,,,"Adams, C., What’s in a name?

It is found that the relationship between metaphors and human thought is systematic as well as complex and that systematicity and complexity of IDEA metaphors intertwine with each other. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.",,,,,,,,,,"Croft, W., The role of domains in the interpretation of metaphors and metonymies (1993) Cognitive Linguistics, 4 (4), pp. 335-370; Evans, V., Green, M., (2006) Cognitive linguistics: An introduction, , Edinburgh, Scotland: Edinburgh University Press; Grady, J.E., Theories are buildings revisited (1997) Cognitive Linguistics, 8 (4), pp. 267-290; Johnson, C., Learnability in the acquisition of multiple senses: SOURCE reconsidered (1997) Proceedings of the twenty-second annual meeting of the Berkeley Linguistics Society, , Juge J., Juge M., (eds), Berkeley, CA: Berkeley Linguistics Society; Kövecses, Z., (2010) Metaphor: A practical introduction, , 2nd ed., Oxford, UK: Oxford University Press; Kövecses, Z., (2015) Where metaphors come from, , Oxford, UK: Oxford University Press; Lakoff, G., The invariance hypothesis: Is abstract reason based on image-schemas?

It is argued that our moral cognition is built on a moral metaphor system. Within the framework of conceptual metaphor theory, this study aims to examine the spatial subsystem of moral metaphors in English. We set out with five pairs of moral metaphors that involve the following spatial source concepts: HIGH and LOW, UPRIGHT and TILTED, LEVEL and UNLEVEL, STRAIGHT and CROOKED, and BIG and SMALL. These metaphors were found to constitute the spatial subsystem of moral metaphors in Chinese. Our primary goal is to find out if the five pairs of moral–spatial metaphors are manifested in English as well. To that end we collected linguistic data from the Corpus of Contemporary American English and searched Google Images for multimodal evidence. Our finding is that the five pairs of moral–spatial metaphors are applicable in English as they are in Chinese. We also discuss issues related to conceptual metaphor theory. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.",,,,,,,,,,"Barcelona, A., On the plausibility of claiming a metonymic motivation for conceptual metaphor (2000) Metaphor and metonymy at the crossroads: A cognitive perspective, , Barcelona A., (ed), Berlin, Germany: Mouton de Gruyter; Brandt, M.J., Reyna, C., The chain of being: A hierarchy of morality (2011) Perspectives on Psychological Science, 6 (5), pp. 428-446; Casasanto, D., When is a linguistic metaphor a conceptual metaphor?

Specifically, the study has identified that the conceptual metaphors, conceptual metonymies, and related concepts manifested in the terms and announcements for orgasm can be categorized into orgasm as a physiological response, orgasm as a psychological state, and orgasm as an ideal goal. We also observed that languages tend to conceptualize orgasm as a physiological response in the terms for orgasm; whereas more languages are inclined to conceptualize orgasm as an ideal goal in the announcements for orgasm. Depending on whether the focus is on the physiological, psychological, and ideal aspects during sex, native speakers of their various languages may conceptualize orgasm with the conceptual metaphors ORGASM IS A PEAK, ORGASM IS FIRE, ORGASM IS DEATH, ORGASM IS A DESTINATION, and ORGASM IS THE RELEASE OF FORCE/SUBSTANCE IN A CONTAINER; conceptual metonymies (i.e., EXCITEMENT FOR ORGASM, SWELLING FOR ORGASM, and HEAT FOR ORGASM); and related concepts (i.e., (FEELING OF) SATISFACTION and (FEELING OF) PLEASURE). In proposing the ideal cognitive model for sexual desire, the study also suggests that sexual desire is an emotion closely related to love and happiness. The intertwining relationship between the three emotions implies that the experience and satisfaction of sexual desire may be important for maintaining the physiological and psychological wellbeing of an individual as well as the development of healthy and loving sexual/romantic relationships. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.",,,,,,,,,,"Aron, A., Henkemeyer, L., Marital satisfaction and passionate love (1995) Journal of Social and Personal Relationships, 12 (1), pp. 139-146; Bancroft, J., (1989) Human sexuality and its problems, , New York, NY: Churchill Livingstone; Borisoff, D., Hahn, D.F., Thinking with the body: Sexual metaphors (1993) Communication Quarterly, 41 (3), pp. 253-260; Braun, V., Gavey, N., McPhillips, K., The “fair deal”?

Although being an educational discourse genre that is essentially concerned with transmitting scientific facts, sex education picture books employ a range of metaphors that categorize and construe the biological knowledge of human reproduction in a way that not only facilitates young children’s understanding of scientific concepts but also instills in them particular values and moralities that are socioculturally conditioned. An examination of the source domains from which the metaphors are drawn and the target domains onto which the metaphors are mapped reveals three types of metaphor, namely, personification, domestication, and cross-experience metaphors. The analysis of seven sex education picture books for pre-school children suggests that these types of metaphor are used purposefully for addressing pedagogical as well as ideological concerns in the introduction of sex-related knowledge in Mainland China. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.",,,,,,,"Ministry of Agriculture of the People's Republic of China, MOA: 14YJC740047","This work is supported by the Project of Humanities and Social Sciences, Ministry of Education, People's Republic of China [Grant No. 14YJC740047].",,"Aresu, A., Sex education in modern and contemporary China: Interrupted debates across the last century (2009) International Journal of Educational Development, 29, pp. 532-541;

We start by comparing existing definitions of linguistic hyperbole. Based on the commonalities shared by these definitions, we provide our operational definition of hyperbole as “an expression that is more extreme than justified given its ontological referent.” The next section argues why it is useful to identify hyperbole, as with metaphor in Metaphor Identification Procedure Vrije Universiteit (MIPVU), at the level of lexical units, and subsequently introduces the steps of HIP. We follow up with two sample analyses of HIP in practice. First, we show how to unitize and analyze one complete sample sentence. Second, we present sample analyses of a number of selected cases.

They are used to improve communication and they are a very powerful tool that might have an influence in human evolution. In this article I argue that metaphors, transformed in powerful memes, adapt to a new communicative niche and contribute to transform it. In order to prove this hypothesis, I study 319 cartoons published in the wake of the Germanwings air crash, where I inventory 144 metaphors. The study shows the conceptual metaphor evolution for a period of 2 weeks, and how the metaphors changed as a result of the variations in the communicative niche, becoming much more efficient communicatively. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.",,,,,,,,,,"Almirabi, M., When metaphors cross cultures (2015) Journal of Language Teaching and Research, 6, pp. 204-209; Bateson, G., (1972) Steps to an ecology of mind.

For instance, when crime is a beast people are more likely to suggest enforcement-oriented approaches to crime-reduction (e.g., by augmenting the police force); reading that crime is a virus, on the other hand, leads people to suggest systemic reforms for the affected community. In the current study, we find that extending metaphoric language into the descriptions of policy interventions bolstered the persuasive influence of metaphoric frames for important issues. That is, in response to a crime virus people were even more likely to endorse social reforms that were described as “treatments,” while in response to a crime beast people were even more likely to endorse “attacking” the problem with harsh enforcement tactics. Of note, people were not simply drawn to extensions of previously instantiated metaphors: when extended metaphors were paired with a conceptually incongruent policy intervention (e.g., “treating” a crime [virus] by augmenting the police force), we found no preference for the policy response. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.",,,,,,,,,,"Bates, D., Maechler, M., Bolker, B., Walker, S., (2014) lme4: Linear mixed-effects models using Eigen and S4, , http://CRAN.R-project.org/package=lme4, R package version 1.1-7; Bosman, J., Persuasive effects of political metaphors (1987) Metaphor and Symbolic Activity, 2, pp. 97-113; Bosman, J., Hagendoorn, L., Effects of literal and metaphorical persuasive messages (1991) Metaphor & Symbolic Activity, 6, pp. 271-292; Bowdle, B.F., Gentner, D., The career of metaphor (2005) Psychological Review, 112, pp. 193-216; Bransford, J.D., Johnson, M.K., Contextual prerequisites for understanding: Some investigations of comprehension and recall (1972) Journal of Verbal Learning and Verbal Behavior, 11, pp. 717-726; Buhrmester, M., Kwang, T., Gosling, S.D., Amazon’s Mechanical Turk: A New source of inexpensive, yet high-quality, data?

It outlines the linguistic patterns in Chinese that manifest the putative underlying spatial subsystem of moral metaphors, which can be summarized by a central metaphor “MORALITY IS SPATIALITY.” In doing so, it focuses on 17 spatial words that instantiate in real-life discourses five pairs of moral–spatial metaphors in their positive and negative valence. The total of 10 metaphors under study forms a cluster as the spatial metaphor subsystem operating in conjunction and connection with other metaphor subsystems in our moral cognition. It is suggested that the 10 conceptual metaphors emerge from four image schemas: UP-DOWN, BALANCE, PATH, and OBJECT. A unified schematic configuration is proposed to lay out the spatial elements and relations represented by the four image schemas in a single diagram. Based on its linguistic analysis, the study also provides a list of prototypical target aspects of MORAL and IMMORAL onto which the source concepts of the 10 moral–spatial metaphors are mapped. The list reflects a division of labor, although with some overlaps, among the 10 metaphors under study. Finally, the study conducts a decompositional analysis of two moral–spatial metaphors as examples showing how deeper analyses of metaphors can be achieved. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.",,,,,,,,,,"Austin, S., Spatial metaphors and somatic communication: The embodiment of multigenerational experiences of helplessness and futility in an obese patient (2013) Journal of Analytical Psychology, 58, pp. 327-346; Bourk, M., Holland, K., From silos to flows: Spatial metaphor and communication responses to the Christchurch earthquakes (2014) Australian Journal of Emergency Management, 29 (2), pp. 35-41; Bromme, R., Stahl, E., Spatial metaphors and writing hypertexts: Study within schools (1999) European Journal of Psychology of Education, 14 (2), pp. 267-281; Brown, M., A geographer reads Geography Club: Spatial metaphor and metonym in textual/sexual space (2006) Cultural Geographies, 13, pp. 313-339; Campbell, C.S., Metaphors we ration by: An interpretation of practical moral reasoning (2013) Soundings: An Interdisciplinary Journal, 96 (3), pp. 254-279; Casasanto, D., Space for thinking (2010) Language, cognition, and space: The state of the art and new directions, , Evans V., Chilton P., (eds), London, UK: Equinox; Casasanto, D., Bodily relativity (2014) Routledge handbook of embodied cognition, , Shapiro L., (ed), London, UK: Routledge; Cienki, A., Straight: An image schema and its metaphorical extensions (1998) Cognitive Linguistics, 9 (2), pp. 107-150; Cuervo, H., Wyn, J., Reflections on the use of spatial and relational metaphors in youth studies (2014) Journal of Youth Studies, 17 (7), pp. 901-915; Davies, C., Spanish-American interiors: Spatial metaphors, gender and modernity (2004) Romance Studies, 22 (1), pp. 27-39; Dirven, R., Taylor, J.R., The conceptualization of vertical space in English: The case of tall (1988) Topics in cognitive linguistics, , Rudzka-Ostyn B., (ed), Amsterdam, The Netherlands: John Benjamins; Gattis, M., (2001) Spatial schemas and abstract thought, , Cambridge, MA: MIT Press; Gibbs, R.W., (1994) The poetic mind: Figurative thought, language, and understanding, , Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press; Gibbs, R.W., Taking metaphor out of our heads and putting it into the cultural world (1999) Metaphor in cognitive linguistics, , Gibbs R.W., Steen G., (eds), Amsterdam, The Netherlands: John Benjamins; Gibbs, R.W., (2006) Embodiment and cognitive science, , Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press; Gibbs, R.W., Conceptual metaphor in thought and social action (2014) The power of metaphor: Examining its influence on social life, , Landau M.J., Robinson M.D., Meier B.P., (eds), Washington, DC: American Psychological Association; Giessner, S., Schubert, T., High in the hierarchy: How vertical location and judgments of leaders’ power are interrelated (2007) Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes, 104, pp. 30-44; Haidt, J., Koller, S.H., Dias, M.G., Affect, culture, and morality, or is it wrong to eat your dog?

First, the reader is presented with a description of the corpus in terms of the distribution of conceptual operations (for the purposes of this work, metaphor and metonymy) and use of modal cues. Subsequently, the weight of mode and marketing strategy to trigger more or less amounts of conceptual complexity is analyzed. This corpus-based survey is complemented with the qualitative analysis of three novel metaphor–metonymy interactions that stem from the data and that have not yet been surveyed in multimodal use. The results show that metaphtonymy (a metaphor–metonymy compound) is the most frequet conceptual operation in the corpus; that there is a significant effect of the use of modes in the activation of different amounts of conceptual complexity; and that the type of advertised product and the marketing strategy has no significant effect on the number and complexity of conceptual mappings in the advertisement. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.",,,,,,,"European Commission, EC: FFI2013-43593-P","The research on which this article is based is supported by a Marie Curie Individual Fellowship (Project ref.: EMMA-658079; European Commission) and by the national project FFI2013-43593-P (Ministry of Innovation and Competitiveness, Spain).",,"Ang, S., Lim, E., The influence of metaphors and product type on brand personality perceptions and attitudes (2006) Journal of Advertising, 35 (2), pp. 39-53; Bhattacharjee, C., (2006) Services marketing, , 1st ed., New Delhi, India: Excel Books; Chang, C.-T., Yen, C.-T., Missing ingredients in metaphor advertising: The right formula of metaphor type, product type, and need for cognition (2013) Journal of Advertising, 42 (1), pp. 80-94; Copeland, M., (1924) Principles of merchandising, , Chicago, IL: A.

We start our discussion with a brief epistemological overview. Thereby two questions are central: (1) How do people conceptualize perception and causality? and (2) When do people perceive causality in perception? Answers will be given, respectively, by considering insights from cognitive linguistics and experimental psychology. In the next section, then, we bring the theoretical discussion to the foreground of Film Studies by showing how the conceptual solutions, as suggested in the prior part, can manifest themselves in cinematic terms. It is through the forced movements of film making (e.g., framing, editing and camera movement), that, we will argue, the viewer is encouraged to see a causal relationship between (1) the object perceived and the character’s visual experience and (2) the character’s visual experience and the change of mental state in the perceiving character. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.",,,,,,,,,,"Arnheim, R., (1957) Film as art, , Berkeley, CA: University of California Press; Barcelona, A., Clarifying and applying the notions of metaphor and metonymy within cognitive linguistics: An update (2002) Metaphor and metonymy in comparison and contrast, , Dirven R., Pörings R., (eds), Berlin, Germany: Mouton de Gruyter; Bernaerts, L., De Geest, D., Herman, L., Bart, V., (2013) Stories and minds: Cognitive approaches to literary narrative, , Lincoln, NE: University of Nebraska Press; Boroditsky, L., Metaphoric structuring: Understanding time through spatial metaphors (2000) Cognition, 75 (1), pp. 1-28; Branigan, E., (1984) Point of view in the cinema, , Berlin, Germany: Mouton de Gruyter; Caracciolo, M., Fictional consciousnesses: A reader’s manual (2012) Style, 46 (1), pp. 42-64; Carroll, N., (2007) Comedy incarnate: Buster Keaton, physical humor, and bodily coping, , Malden, MA: Blackwell Publishing; Chattah, J., Film music as embodiment (2015) Embodied cognition and cinema, , Coëgnarts M., Kravanja P., (eds), Leuven, Belgium: Leuven University Press; Choi, J., Leaving it up to the imagination: POV shots and imagining from the inside (2005) Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism, 63 (1), pp. 17-25; Coëgnarts, M., Kravanja, P., A study in cinematic subjectivity: Metaphors of perception in film (2014) Metaphor and the Social World, 4 (2), pp. 149-173; Coëgnarts, M., Kravanja, P., (2015) Embodied cognition and cinema, , Leuven, Belgium: Leuven University Press; Coëgnarts, M., Kravanja, P., Embodied cinematic subjectivity: Metaphorical and metonymical modes of character perception in film (2015) Embodied cognition and cinema, , Coëgnarts M., Kravanja P., (eds), Leuven, Belgium: Leuven University Press; Coëgnarts, M., Kravanja, P., With the past in front of the character: Evidence for spatial-temporal metaphors in cinema (2015) Metaphor and Symbol, 30 (3), pp. 218-239; Currie, G., (1995) Image and mind: Film, philosophy and cognitive science, , Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press; Dewell, R., Dynamic patterns of containment (2005) From perception to meaning: Image schemas in cognitive linguistics, , Heampe B., (ed), Berlin, Germany: Mouton De Gruyter; Evans, V., (2003) The structure of time, , Amsterdam, The Netherlands: John Benjamins; Fahlenbrach, K., Emotions in sound: Audiovisual metaphors in the sound design of narrative films (2008) Projections: The Journal for Movies and Mind, 2 (2), pp. 85-103; Fahlenbrach, K., Metaphoric narratives.

Perhaps not coincidentally, terminological inconsistencies relating to mapping have led to theoretical problems both for single-domain theories of metonymy and attempts to examine Lakoff’s invariance hypothesis.

The phenomenon of transference, where clients superimpose their past experiences onto present life situations, occurs frequently in psychotherapy, and may have varied effects on treatment outcome depending on how it is managed or “worked through.” While previous work has linked transference to metaphor based on their theoretical similarity, this article explores the relationship on the basis of actual psychotherapy talk between a therapist–client dyad at a Chinese university counseling center. It combines clinical and discourse analytic observations to the model working through transference as an interactional process of constructing a “PRESENT IS PAST” conceptual metaphor, and suggests that the process involves guiding the client to move from an awareness of correspondences at the conceptual level (i.e., between entities, attributes, and relations), to the transferential level (between feelings, emotions, and attitudes). Methodological, theoretical, and practical implications for contemporary metaphor research and psychotherapy practice are discussed, and some directions offered for future research. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.",,,,,,,"PolyU 256005/15H

In the present study, we investigated if such variables would also be predictive within a more naturalistic context, where other variables, such as the intention to include an explanation (Roncero, Kennedy, & Smyth, 2006), may also influence people’s decision. Specifically, we investigated the production of metaphor and simile expressions on the Internet via the Google search engine and checked for accompanying explanations, as well as the properties they expressed, to examine whether ratings such as aptness, conventionality, as well as participants’ own stated preference or the intention to produce an explanation, would predict which topic–vehicle pairs appeared more often as metaphors. We found that participants’ stated preference predicted metaphor dominance on the Internet, and that apt topic–vehicles occurred more often as metaphors. The explanations collected, however, occurred 82% of the time after similes, and familiar expressions were the most explained. Finally, comparing the properties expressed in these explanations to normed property lists, we found that simile explanations typically expressed a novel conception of the topic–vehicle relationship. Therefore, we found that Internet posters use metaphors to convey an apt relationship, as found in previous laboratory studies, but prefer using a simile frame when they want to express a relationship that readers will find novel. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.",,,,,,,"Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada, SSHRC

We propose that a metaphorical reading can be imposed on a given expression regardless of its semantic content. We suggest that there is a class of constructions (e.g., this X is such a Y or what a Y this X is) that impose metaphorical interpretation. We present findings from three experiments and from corpus-based analyses that support our proposal. Experiments 1–2 compared interpretations of expressions that can have both a literal and a metaphorical meaning (e.g., this book is an encyclopedia) when embedded in a standard metaphorical form and in a form that imposes metaphoricity. In Experiment 3 we examine reaction time to such forms in an attempt to identify interference of form with early metaphorical processing. Two corpus-based analyses characterize the use of these two metaphorical constructions in natural language. We discuss the independence of metaphoricity from semantics, as demonstrated by forms that impose metaphorical interpretations. © , Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,"Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv University

In contrast, the default interpretation of the affirmative counterparts (He is the most organized student) is a salience-based interpretation (here literal); their non-default interpretation is a non-salient alternative (here sarcastic; Experiment 1). When in equally strongly supportive contexts, default yet non-salient negative sarcasm is processed faster than (1) non-default, non-salient yet affirmative sarcasm and (2) faster than non-default yet salience-based negative literalness. Complementarily, default, salience-based affirmative literalness is derived faster than (1) non-default non-salient affirmative sarcasm, and (2) faster than non-default albeit salience-based negative literalness (Experiment 2).

Priming concrete concepts—by means of logo exposure or other procedures—changes attitudes toward dissimilar abstract targets in metaphor-consistent ways. It is assumed, however, that observers apply a logo’s metaphor externally to interpret the company and its service. This research examined the possibility that observers may instead apply that metaphor internally to interpret their current condition and hence their need for the company’s service. We hypothesized that the same logo can have divergent effects on company liking depending on the direction of metaphor application. To test this possibility, we built on evidence that people apply available metaphors especially when they feel unsure about the target. We predicted that observers would apply a logo’s metaphor externally when unsure about the company, but internally when unsure about themselves. Three experiments provide convergent support for hypotheses. We discuss implications for research and marketing. Imagine that you walk by a new company offering “creative solutions,” and pasted on their sign is a logo depicting a bright lightbulb. This is not a lighting company, so the logo must be a metaphor. But do you interpret that metaphor to describe the nature of the company’s service or your condition? If the former, the logo signals that the company “illuminates” new solutions to your problems; hence, it addresses your needs, tempting you to inquire further. Yet if you implicitly associate the lightbulb with your internal state, you might perceive that you are sufficiently illuminated (i.e., aware of creative solutions). In this case, the company is irrelevant to your needs, and therefore less appealing.

The purpose of this is to investigate the long-standing claim that metaphoric mappings are from less abstract concepts to more abstract concepts. First, abstractness is modeled using Searle’s social ontology and this model of abstractness evaluated using a participant-based measure of abstractness. Second, this model of abstractness is used to determine the direction and distance in abstractness of metaphoric mappings. Direction of abstractness in these mappings is whether the source or target concept is the more abstract. Distance is the difference in abstractness between source and target concepts. Both factors influence metaphoricity, as measured using introspection and a participant-based study of metaphoricity. The results give empirical support for a long-standing claim about abstractness in mappings, but also provide important new details about the nature of metaphoric mappings.

The study examines whether these moral metaphors are manifested in Chinese and English, looking for linguistic evidence in both languages. It is found that the studied moral metaphors are applicable in both languages at varying degrees. This finding suggests that these metaphors may range from being widespread to being universal. The study then further analyzes them regarding whether they are primary or complex metaphors and whether they are equal in status, applying a decompositional approach to metaphor analysis. The result suggests that the moral metaphors under study are complex rather than primary metaphors, and that they are actually not equal in status, some depending on others in meaning making in our moral cognition. If the analysis is valid, the implications are: some conceptual metaphors are more fundamental than others, those that are more fundamental are more likely to be widespread or universal, and hypotheses can be made about conceptual metaphors based on in-depth analysis of their conceptual composition.

Analyzing 414 cartoons published after the death of the cartoonists of the French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo, I propose a metaphoric founder effect with the metaphors “PENCIL IS A WEAPON,” “PENCIL IS A CARTOONIST,” and “PENCIL IS FREEDOM,” and a subsequent metaphor drift that creates many related metaphors. Additionally, the success of these metaphors turns the pencil meme into a very efficient and fast-spreading item representing not only the work of cartoonists, but also the fundamental values of Western culture, such as freedom of expression.

Examination of the metaphorical language used in these conversations revealed that SIGHT plays an important role in academic mentoring in English. Lecturers often frame their advice to undergraduate students in terms of what has been called “UNDERSTANDING IS SEEING,” on the face of it a somewhat unsurprising finding. If one takes it that the correlation between mental and visual activity is somehow “primary” (Grady, 1997; Lakoff & Johnson, 1999; Sweetser, 1991) then this way of reasoning about learning and knowledge should be common ground in conversations between English- and Spanish-speaking interlocutors. However, we found no such alignment between the two groups of participants in an academic setting. The Spanish speakers not only used words and terms associated with vision significantly less frequently than their English-speaking interlocutors, but also with different meanings. We explore these quantitative and qualitative differences in metaphorical uses of three of the terms used by all participants to talk about learning—see, look and focus—and conclude that, although the “UNDERSTANDING IS SEEING” mapping might be available as a way of reasoning about learning and knowledge to people from different cultures, discourse practices influences how salient it is for different groups of speakers. In this regard, it appears to be culturally salient for English-speaking academics, but not necessarily so for speakers of other languages.

For instance, convincing empirical evidence coming from the manifestation mode of cinema is still lacking. This article attempts to fill this gap by bringing the discussion of temporal metaphors to the foreground of character subjectivity in film. Using concise case-studies taken from various films, this study provides evidence that a majority of flashback scenes seem to base their conceptions of time on a static Ego-Reference-Point model in which the past appears to be in front of the character’s eyes on screen.

Specifically, this study claims that multimodal fusion model evolves from two metonymic-metaphoric networks, i.e., related metonymic network and diversified metaphoric network, and combines the conceptual, visual, and verbal modes. Our analysis demonstrates that multimodal fusion is a significant and recurrent representation technique in the genre of political cartoon and has the cognitive function of encapsulating the abstract complex political debates efficiently with irony and humorous effect. Furthermore, our analysis shows the important role of metonymy and demonstrates how metonymies and metaphors are interwoven in the process of multimodal fusion, which underlies the metaphorical mappings of conceptual scenarios related to “POLITICS IS GAME” and “POLITICS IS WAR.” Finally, this study shows that although the critical messages and distinct stances of political cartoons in two newspapers both emerge through multimodal fusion, they are highlighted and contrasted through prominent visual features and verbal context shown in the cartoons. © , Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Bain, J., Chaban, N., Kelly, S., Crumbling giant, rising dragon?: Chinese news media cartoon reflections on the Eurozone debt crisis (2012) Communication, Politics & Culture, 45, pp. 217-240; Barcelona, A., Clarifying and applying the notions of metaphor and metonymy within cognitive linguistics: An update (2002) Metaphor and metonymy in comparison and contrast, pp. 207-278. , Dirven R., Pörings R., (eds), Berlin, Germany: Mouton de Gruyter; Bounegru, L., Forceville, C., Metaphors in editorial cartoons representing the global financial crisis (2011) Visual Communication, 10 (2), pp. 209-229; Chiang, W.-Y., Duann, R.-F., Conceptual metaphors for SARS: “War” between whom?

Transgender is the term ascribed to those who have begun or completed a change in their sex characteristics from male to female or female to male. Using both qualitative and quantitative measures, I examine an archive of narrative data and a transition-specific corpus to show how spoken and written narrative support a spatially based representation of gender identity and transition. Two robust models are revealed in the data, each carrying a set of suppositions consequential to how speakers understand their lived experience. I show how metaphor-evoking trigger lexemes relate to each model and can be used jointly to demonstrate conceptual salience. This investigation should be seen as part of an ever-growing body of research directed at revealing the unconscious assumptions, which organize speakers’ comprehension of complex topics with political relevance (cf.

It is considered an exceptional, one-off phenomenon that can be distinguished clearly from prototypical conceptual metaphors. However, according to Perceptual Simulation Theory, all language, both literal and nonliteral, is understood partially by simulating in our minds what it would be like to actually perceive the things that are being described, which suggests that visualization is not unique to image metaphor. As I argue in this article, the mental imagery invited by image metaphors is nevertheless likely to be particularly vivid, detailed, and complex, as well as involving more conscious and deliberate thought processes. Since it is hard to consider visualization in abstract terms, pictorial equivalents of image metaphors are used to support my claims. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Barsalou, L.W., Grounding symbolic operations in the brain’s modal systems (2008) Embodied grounding: Social, cognitive, affective, and neuroscientific approaches, pp. 9-42. , Semin G.

Evidence for these three types of metaphoric utterances comes from introspective evidence about metaphor-in-language, from a survey-based study of metaphoricity, from a computational model of metaphoricity, and from a meta-study of the examples used in published metaphor research. These three types of metaphoric utterances are used to narrow the scope of existing theories of metaphor and thus to synthesize them, showing that competing theories describe and are concerned with different types of metaphoric utterances. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Bezuidenhout, A., Metaphor and what is said_ A defense of a direct expression view of metaphor (2001) Midwest Studies in Philosophy, 25 (1), pp. 156-186; Black, M., How metaphors work: A reply to Donald Davidson (1979) Critical Inquiry, 6 (1), pp. 131-143; Camp, E., Contextualism, metaphor, and what is said (2006) Mind & Language, 21 (3), pp. 280-309; Davidson, D., What metaphors mean (1978) Critical Inquiry, 5 (1), pp. 31-47; Dunn, J., Gradient semantic intuitions of metaphoric expressions (2011) Metaphor and Symbol, 26 (1), pp. 53-67; Dunn, J., Evaluating the premises and results of four metaphor identification systems (2013) Computational linguistics and intelligent text processing: Proceedings of the 14th International Conference, CICLing 2013, pp. 471-486. , Gelbukh A., (ed), Berlin, Germany: Springer-Verlag; Dunn, J., How linguistic structure influences and helps to predict metaphoric meaning (2013) Cognitive Linguistics, 24 (1), pp. 33-66; Dunn, J., What metaphor identification systems can tell us about metaphor-in-language (2013) Proceedings of the first workshop on metaphor in NLP, pp. 1-10. , Shutova E., Klebanov B.

However, they can instead be interpreted in a likeness-exaggerating way, under which “Libraries are supermarkets” is simply an exaggerated way of saying that libraries are like supermarkets to a very high degree. This interpretation option follows from simple, general considerations about exaggeration and likeness scales. In this way it is preferable to the abbreviated-simile view of metaphor, and in any case it can be added to any existing metaphor account. It has broad significance for the theory of metaphor and simile, but also provides a new, straightforward explanation of the special, likeness-strengthening effect in utterances such as “Libraries aren’t merely like supermarkets, they are supermarkets.” This effect exists despite evidence that X-is-Y metaphors do not generally convey more likeness than corresponding similes. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,"Leverhulme Trust","The research in this article was supported in part by Research Project Grant F/00 094/BE from the Leverhulme Trust in the UK.",,"Aisenman, R.A., Structure-mapping and the simile-metaphor preference (1999) Metaphor and Symbol, 14 (1), pp. 45-51; Barnden, J.A., (2013) A hyperbolic account of the apparent forcefulness of nominal metaphors.

Specifically, it is claimed that there are no interesting differences (in either interpretation or processing) between hyperbolic and metaphorical uses (Sperber & Wilson, 2008). In recent work, we have set out to provide a more fine-grained articulation of the similarities and differences between hyperbolic and metaphorical uses and their relation to literal uses (Carston & Wearing, 2011, 2014). We have defended the view that hyperbolic use involves a shift of magnitude along a dimension which is intrinsic to the encoded meaning of the hyperbole vehicle, while metaphor involves a multi-dimensional qualitative shift away from the encoded meaning of the metaphor vehicle. In this article, we present three experiments designed to test the predictions of this analysis, using a variety of tasks (paraphrase elicitation, self-paced reading and sentence verification). The results of the study support the view that hyperbolic and metaphorical interpretations, despite their commonalities as loose uses of language, are significantly different. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,"Leverhulme Trust","The study reported here was carried out as part of the project “Understanding metaphor: ad hoc concepts and imagined worlds,” which is funded by the Leverhulme Trust (Ref.

We applied a systematic method to identify metaphor-related words (Metaphor Identification Procedure Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam [MIPVU]; Steen, Dorst, Herrmann, Kaal, Krennmayer, & Pasma, 2010) and to label conceptual metaphors (Babarczy, Bencze, Fekele, & Simon, 2010) that reduces the analyst’s bias in the identification of metaphors. Our main findings are: (a) the presence of metaphors in academic discourse on music (29%) is significantly higher than in academic discourse in general (19%; Steen, Dorst, Herrmann, Kaal, Krennmayer, & Pasma, 2010); (b) most of the identified metaphors to describe musical motion are correlational metaphors (Grady, 1999); and (c) metaphors for musical motion are structured in the same way as the metaphors that make up Lakoff’s (1993) Event Structure Metaphor, thus giving rise to the Musical Event Structure Metaphor. ©, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,"Part of the research on which this article is based has been funded by a FPU grant (Ministry of Education, Spain).",,"Babarczy, A., Fekele, I., Simon, E., (2010), http://www.abstract-project.eu/papers/metaphor_malta_2.2.1.pdf, The automatic identification of conceptual metaphors in Hungarian texts: A corpus-based analysis.

This has had two consequences: the disregard of the space behind the participant (exploited in language and gesture) and the creation of potential task demands produced by spatialized manual button-presses. We introduce and test a new paradigm that uses auditory stimuli and vocal responses to address these issues. Participants made temporal judgments about deictic or sequential relationships presented auditorily along a body-centered sagittal or transversal axis. Results involving the transversal axis replicated previous work while sagittal axis results were surprising. Deictic judgments did not use the sagittal axis but sequential judgments did, in a previously undocumented way. Participants associated earlier judgments with the space in front of them and later judgments with the space behind them. These findings, using a new approach, provide evidence that different time concepts recruit space differently, mediated by meaning, stimulus modality and response mode. ©, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,"Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada, NSERC","This work was supported by a Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada PGS-D awarded to Esther J.

A designer generates a metaphor by deciding on a quality of a target to highlight and selecting a corresponding source that conveys this quality; the user interprets the designer’s intentions via the end product. The depth of the generated metaphor can be assessed by the extent to which the highlighted quality is salient for the target: Metaphors focusing on a salient quality of the target are termed “surface” metaphors, whereas those focusing on a non-salient quality are called “deep” metaphors. In this article, we investigated both the effect of the expertise level of the designer (i.e., novice or expert) and different types of intention (i.e., pragmatic or experiential) on metaphor depth, through a study in which groups of expert and novice designers were asked to generate metaphors and external judges evaluated the depth of the metaphors created. Results indicated that having a pragmatic intention or being a novice designer led to the generation of surface metaphors, whereas having experiential intentions or being an expert facilitated the generation of deeper metaphors. Detailed observations are included regarding the nature of decisions made during the product metaphor generation process that produce comprehensible and aesthetically pleasing metaphors. Additionally, our findings have implications for metaphor research and design practice. ©, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,"453-10-004","Paul Hekkert was supported by MAGW VICI grant number 453-10-004 from The Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO).",,"Barsalou, L.W., Context-independent and context-dependent information in concepts (1982) Memory & Cognition, 10 (1), pp. 82-93; Bowdle, B.F., Gentner, D., The career of metaphor (2005) Psychological Review, 112 (1), pp. 193-216; Camac, M.K., Glucksberg, S., Metaphors do not use associations between concepts, they are used to create them (1984) Journal of Psycholinguistic Research, 13 (6), pp. 443-455; Casakin, H.P., Goldschmidt, G., Reasoning by visual analogy in design problem-solving: The role of guidance (2000) Environment and Planning B: Planning and Design, 27, pp. 105-119; Chiappe, D.L., Chiappe, P., The role of working memory in metaphor production and comprehension (2007) Journal of Memory and Language, 56, pp. 172-188; Christensen, B., Schunn, C., The relationship of analogical distance to analogical function and preinventive structure: The case of engineering design (2007) Memory & Cognition, 35, pp. 29-38; Cila, N., Borsboom, F., Hekkert, P., Determinants of aesthetic preference for product metaphors, , in press, Manuscript submitted for publication; Cila, N., Hekkert, P., Visch, V., Source selection in product metaphor generation: The effects of salience and relatedness (2014) International Journal of Design, 8 (1), pp. 15-28; Crilly, N., Maier, A., Clarkson, P.J., Representing artefacts as media: Modelling the relationship between designer intent and consumer experience (2008) International Journal of Design, 2 (3), pp. 15-27; Crilly, N., Moultrie, J., Clarkson, P.J., Shaping things: Intended consumer response and the other determinants of product form (2008) Design Studies, 30, pp. 224-254; Cross, N., Expertise in design: An overview (2004) Design Studies, 25, pp. 427-441; Cupchik, G.C., The “interanimation” of worlds: Creative metaphors in art and design (2003) The Design Journal, 6 (2), pp. 14-28; Farrington-Darby, T., Wilson, J.R., The nature of expertise: A review (2006) Applied Ergonomics, 37, pp. 17-32; Feltovich, P.J., Prietula, M.J., Ericsson, K.A., Studies of expertise from psychological perspectives (2006) The Cambridge handbook of expertise and expert performance, pp. 41-67. , Ericsson K.

This insight is the starting point of this article presenting two innovations to comprehending and analyzing metaphor, one theoretical and one in terms of methodology. On a theoretical level we argue for a new orientation to metaphor and metaphoricity based on enactive cognition and distributed language and cognition. In recent years enactive and distributed cognition have been developing a new concept of cognition as an inter-bodily and ecologically afforded achievement, and in light of this theoretical development we propose an approach to metaphor as a multi-body, multi-party, and multi-timescale phenomenon. On a methodological level we demonstrate a new way of analyzing metaphoricity in multimodal social interaction based on in-depth video analyses of two real life examples in which we introduce metaphorical identification criteria focusing on doubleness in meaning, affordances for co-action, co-ordination, and co-experience. Here metaphoricity is explored as a distinct and emergent aspect of the coordination processes that constitute social interaction. In the final section we point to the general findings of the analyses and discuss the challenges that conceptual metaphor theory faces in the light of the new tendencies within cognitive science as well as a possible way forward. ©, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,"FP7-PEOPLE-2010-ITN, 264828","This work is supported by the Marie-Curie Initial Training Network, “TESIS: Towards an Embodied Science of InterSubjectivity” (FP7-PEOPLE-2010-ITN, 264828).",,"Bottineau, D., Language and enaction (2010) Enaction toward a new paradigm for cognitive science, , Stewart J., Gappene O., Di Paolo E.

For example, bad events happen when movie characters are going downwards, or when lights go off. Monsters and villains emerge from below and from the darkness. And protagonists get lost and stuck in dark underground caves, dungeons, tunnels, mines, bunkers or sewers. Even movies that are primarily set above ground or in bright light have the most suspenseful scenes happening beneath the ground and in the dark. An analysis of several horror movies highlights the striking consistency with which the two metaphors ""EVIL IS DOWN"" and ""EVIL IS DARK"" are used within this genre. I will argue that these metaphors help in creating fear. Moreover, I will outline how cinematic manifestations of metaphor elaborate and extend metaphorical concepts and ultimately may have a formative role in keeping metaphors alive within a culture.

In the current research we investigate the manner in which the concept EATING in two nonrelated languages, namely Afrikaans (a Germanic language) and Northern Sotho (a Bantu language) gives rise to metaphorical expressions in these two languages. The two notions of cultural model and metaphor form the cornerstones of our research. The basic question guiding our research is whether the metaphorical mappings originating from the same source domain (EATING) onto various target domains are the same in the two languages and secondly, whether there is any evidence that differences-if any-are culturally motivated.Our study is corpus-based. Lexical items belonging to the source domain of eating were used as search nodes in our corpus search. Our analysis indicates that the metaphorical source-domain-target-domain mappings in the two languages show a large amount of overlap. As far as the metaphors that we identified are concerned, remarkable similarities and very few-and these not significant-differences were found.

We show how contradictory framing between public officials and members of the community as well as within each group may have contributed to unintended and asymmetrical ironies, and ultimately to the failure of the meeting to achieve the objectives of either group.

In Experiment 1, participants performed a perceptual-discrimination task after judging the meaning of a word that varied in its religious meaning (God-related, Devil-related, or religiously neutral). Perceptual discrimination was better in the up-right quadrant when primed by God-related words. In contrast, enhanced perceptual discrimination was observed in the down-left quadrant when primed by Devil-related words. These metaphor-attention effects were abolished in Experiment 2, when only perceptual analyses of religious words were required in a font-type judgment task. Taken together, these findings support the attentional capture effect of conceptual metaphors and the necessity of semantic encoding of conceptual representations.

The genre consists of a set of poems representing a myriad of potential divine messages for problem-stricken individuals wanting to seek help from the Divine in the folk religious context. Collected from on-the-spot tshiam-si interpretations conducted in two temples in Taiwan, the data comprised five cases of tshiam-si interpretations. Building on several recent studies that advocate complementary perspectives on metaphor, this article demonstrates how explanations of tshiam-si interpretations benefit from cognitive linguistic and relevance theoretic approaches to metaphors, and how the complementary approaches fit in well with some aspects of real-life tshiam-si interpretations. All in all, by attending to the conceptual, the sociocultural, and the pragmatic of tshiam-si metaphors, this study explores the dynamic coupling of metaphorical cognition and metaphorical communication.

A key barrier is that current metaphor analysis relies on linguistic evidence, a resource that archaeologists rarely have. Methods for interpreting entirely ""material metaphors"" have yet to develop. This article explores CMT in a domain of long-standing archaeological interest: settlement structure. Anthropologists have long recognized that hunter-gatherers place their dwellings close to those they are close to socially, usually their kin. Archaeologists have assumed the same holds true for prehistory-although without direct evidence. This article explains why people consistently associate with their kin this way, and how the metaphor, ""SOCIAL DISTANCE IS PHYSICAL DISTANCE,"" structures hunter-gatherer campsites worldwide. Archaeologists can infer the existence of this metaphor in the archaeological record without linguistic support. Furthermore, they can assume it exists in all human societies for as long as human brains have been wired up as they currently are.

Linguistic analysis and experimental review is provided to support the notion that what is commonly referred to as spatial cognition (or mental space) in the cognitive sciences always contains time, and that what is commonly referred to as temporal cognition (or mental time) always contains space. For ""spatial cognition"" the term object-spatiotemporal cognition (or object spacetime) and for ""temporal cognition"" the term event-spatiotemporal cognition (or event spacetime) is introduced. In order to exemplify the virtue of the new spacetime account (with its two subdomains, object spacetime and event spacetime) with a specific example, it is investigated how this new notion can substantially refine our understanding of space-time conceptual metaphor. A new conceptual-metaphor spacetime typology for cognitive processing underlying fictive motion and non-fictive motion is also proposed. Implications of the new spacetime account are discussed for metaphorically mapped mental perspective, metaphorically mapped embodiment, and cognitive science in general. Finally, specific reasons are given why the current proposal of cognitive spacetime cannot be equated with the concept of spacetime in modern physics.

English exhibits two deictic space-time metaphors: the ""moving ego"" metaphor conceptualizes the ego as moving forward through time and the ""moving time"" metaphor conceptualizes time as moving forward towards the ego. Earlier research investigating the psychological reality of these metaphors has shown that engaging in certain types of spatial-motion thinking may influence how people reason about events in time. More recently, research has shown that people's interactions with cultural artifacts may also influence their representations of time. Extending research on space-time mappings in new directions, three experiments investigated the role of cultural artifacts, namely calendars and clocks, in the interpretation of metaphorical expressions about time. Taken together, the results provide initial evidence that, in their interpretation of ambiguous metaphorical expressions about time, people automatically access and use spatial representations of absolute time, whereby moving forward in space corresponds with moving later in time. Moreover, asking participants to use a reverse space-time mapping causes interference, which is reflected through their temporal reasoning.

Two experiments were conducted. In Experiment 1, 45 participants were asked to recall sentences with canonic and non-canonic order. In Experiment 2, 41 participants performed a lexical decision task to the final word of a canonic or non-canonic sentence. The results show that concreteness plays an important role in recalling word order in both literal and metaphorical sentences. In addition, canonic metaphorical sentences were processed faster than were non-canonic metaphorical sentences. Our findings suggest that concreteness affects element order in conjunction constructions but that the effect of concreteness is more pronounced in metaphorical phrases. These findings are discussed in the context of the class inclusion framework (Glucksberg & Keysar, 1990).

Focus groups discussed how violence changes perceptions of risk, decisions of daily life, and attitudes to others. Metaphor vehicles were identified in transcribed data, then grouped together semantically; 15 vehicle groupings were used with similar frequencies, 16 groupings more in UK data, 14 more in Brazil data. Systematic and framing metaphors were found inside vehicle groupings. A small set of frequent verbal metaphors work as predicted by conceptual metaphor theory. Other verbal metaphor vehicles work much more specifically, as posited by discourse dynamics theory, metaphorizing contextually distinct aspects of living with violence. Major differences were found in responses to violence: UK participants demonstrate feelings of powerlessness and lack of agency through metaphor vehicles relating to Games of Chance, the Concealed nature of terrorist activity, and Body Postures negatively evaluating response from the authorities; Brazilian participants use metaphor vehicles of Violence to emphasize how the threat of urban violence itself becomes a powerful social force that constrains daily activities. © 2014 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,"Economic and Social Research Council, ESRC: ES/G033978/1",,,"Boers, F., Applied linguistics perspectives on cross-cultural variation in conceptual metaphor (2003) Metaphor and Symbol, 18 (4), pp. 231-238; Cameron, L., (2003) Metaphor in educational discourse, , London, UK, London, UK,: Continuum; Cameron, L., Confrontation or complementarity: Metaphor in language use and cognitive metaphor theory (2007) Annual Review of Cognitive Linguistics, 5, pp. 107-135; Cameron, L., The Cambridge handbook of metaphor and thought (2008) Metaphor and talk, pp. 197-211. , In: Gibbs R.

The article adopts the general framework of conceptual metaphor theory (CMT) to compare and contrast the differences and/or similarities in the conceptualizations as well as the language-specific construals or elaborations of shared conceptual metaphors of fear in the two languages. The analysis of the language-specific realizations of the shared metaphorical/metonymic conceptualizations of the emotion concept reveals both similarities and differences in the two languages, showing support for the cultural embodied cognition thesis, namely, the similarities in the conceptualization of emotions across cultures may be explained in terms of universal embodied cognition from which general metaphorical principles derive. However, the differences in language-specific elaborations may be explained in terms of cultural filtering of the general universal conceptualizations to reflect human experiences that are more salient to a particular sociocultural group. This analysis also shows a metaphor-metonymy interaction in the conceptualization of emotions across cultures. © 2014 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Ansah, G.N., (2011) Metaphor and bilingual cognition, , The case of Akan and English in Ghana (Unpublished doctoral thesis).

In visual metaphors, perceptual features of the source and the target are objectively present as images. Moreover, to determine perceptual similarity, we use an image-based search system that computes similarity based on low-level perceptual features. We hypothesize that perceptual similarity at the level of color, shape, texture, orientation, and the like, between the source and the target image facilitates metaphorical comprehension and aids creative interpretation. We present three experiments, two of which are eye-movement studies, to demonstrate that in the interpretation and generation of visual metaphors, perceptual similarity between the two images is recognized at a subconscious level, and facilitates the search for creative conceptual associations in terms of emergent features. We argue that the capacity to recognize perceptual similarity-considered to be a hallmark of creativity-plays a major role in the creative understanding of metaphors. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Anaki, D., Faust, M., Kravetz, S., Cerebral hemispheric asymmetries in processing lexical metaphors (1998) Neuropsychologia, 36, pp. 353-362; Blackwell, A., (1998) Metaphor In Diagrams, , (Unpublished doctoral dissertation).

The results of four experiments suggest a tight mental link between similarity and proximity. Two experiments revealed that people judge entities to be more similar to each other when they are placed closely in space, while two other experiments showed that entities are judged to be closer to each other when they are thought to be more similar. We discuss this bidirectional metaphor transfer effect in light of approaches to metaphor understanding, including the long-standing view that metaphorical mappings are assumed to be asymmetrical. We also consider the implications of this bi-directional mapping for high level cognition. © Taylor & Francis Group.",,,,,,,,,,"Barcelona, A., On the plausibility of claiming a metonymic motivation for conceptual metaphor (2000) Metaphor and Metonymy At the Crossroads, pp. 32-58. , A.

We are interested in uncovering regular-novel metonymy computation discrepancies, and whether they are treated differently in the different languages. The distinction between novel and regular metonymy is discussed by the existing theoretical treatments of metonymy as well as in psycholinguistic research. The findings of this study constitute further experimental support for the psychological reality of this distinction. In addition, it is demonstrated that the speakers of the three languages treat novel and regular metonymy differently. Significant findings are the acceptability of novel metonymy in Korean and the relative lack of conventionalization effect for regular metonymy in Korean and Spanish. We conclude that current theoretical approaches to metonymy should focus more on cross-linguistic differences and that further language comparisons are warranted and needed, in comprehension as well as in processing. © Taylor & Francis Group.",,,,,,,,,,"Barcelona, A., Metonymy behind grammar: The motivation of the seemingly ""irregular"" grammatical behavior of English paragon names (2004) Studies in Linguistic Motivation, pp. 357-374. , G.

While metaphor deliberateness and conventionality/novelty are conceptually distinct, associations are likely to exist in practice. This article focuses on the deliberate use of conventional metaphor in images, by way of examining the use of animate and anthropomorphic metaphors in an instance of corporate branding discourse (i.e., the prospectuses of Singapore's corporatized universities). Through our analysis, we show that deliberate conventional metaphor serves to reinforce particular conceptualizations rather than effect radical conceptual change. Moreover, we discuss visual and multimodal metaphor as deliberate if used in carefully crafted texts and draw on the notion of an image's connotative meaning to point out how such deliberateness can be further accentuated. The article concludes by discussing some implications for how the degree of conventionality is likely to have an effect on how deliberate metaphor achieves its key objective of changing addressees' concepts of a particular Target. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Aaker, J.L., Dimensions of brand personality (1997) Journal of Marketing Research, 34 (3), pp. 347-356; Anderson, J., (1990) The adaptive character of thought, , Hillside, NJ, Hillside, NJ: Erlbaum; Balmer, J.M.T., Corporate identity, corporate branding and corporate marketing: Seeing through the fog (2001) European Journal of Marketing, 35 (3-4), pp. 248-291; Balmer, J.M.T., Strategic corporate brand alignment: Perspectives from identity based views of corporate brands (2012) European Journal of Marketing, 46 (7-8), pp. 1064-1092; Barthes, R., (1977) Image, music, text, , In: Heath S., editors London, England, London: Fontana, Trans; Beger, A., Deliberate metaphors?

Additionally, when metaphoric utterances appear in narrative contexts, readers readily judge story characters as having a closer relationship (Horton, 2007). The present work tests whether the relationship implied to exist between characters can influence how readers process metaphoric utterances during narrative comprehension. In two experiments, participants read brief stories that described interactions between two characters portrayed as being familiar with one another to varying degrees. Critical utterances contained either a literal or metaphoric expression that commented on an aspect of the previous story context. In both experiments, readers were as fast to read metaphoric utterances as literal utterances in the context of close, familiar relationships, but were slower to read metaphoric utterances in the context of unfamiliar relationships. Experiment 2 established that this pattern was especially strong for less-conventional metaphors. In general, the level of intimacy established between characters appears to shape the ease with which readers integrate meanings expressed via metaphor into their understanding of the narrative situation. © 2013 Copyright Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Ambady, N., Bernieri, F.J., Richeson, J.A., Toward a histology of social behavior: Judgmental accuracy from thin slices of the behavioral stream (2000) Advances in experimental social psychology, 32, pp. 201-271. , In: Zanna M., editors San Diego, CA, San Diego, CA: Academic Press; Bates, D., Maechler, M., Bolker, B., (2011) Lmer4: Linear mixed-effects models using S4 classes, , http://CRAN.R-project.org/package=lme4, R package version 0.999375-40; Black, M., Metaphor (1954) Proceedings of the Aristotelian Society, 55, pp. 273-294; Blasko, D.G., Connine, C., Effects of familiarity and aptness on metaphor processing (1993) Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition, 19, pp. 295-308; Bowdle, B.F., Gentner, D., The career of metaphor (2005) Psychological Review, 112, pp. 193-216; Cameron, L., (2003) Metaphor and educational discourse, , London, England, London: Continuum; Cameron, L., Stelma, J., Metaphor clusters in discourse (2004) Journal of Applied Linguistics, 1, pp. 7-36; Charteris-Black, J., (2005) Politicians and rhetoric: The persuasive power of metaphor, , London, England, London: Palgrave Macmillan; Coates, J., Talk in a play frame: More on laughter and intimacy (2007) Journal of Pragmatics, 39, pp. 29-49; Cohen, T., Metaphor and the cultivation of intimacy (1978) Critical Inquiry, 5, pp. 3-12; Costanzo, M., Archer, D., Interpreting the expressive behavior of others: The interpersonal perception task (1989) Journal of Nonverbal Behavior, 13, pp. 225-245; Deignan, A., Figurative language in discourse (2012) Cognitive pragmatics.

The main claim argued is that Blending theory accounts for complex processes of meaning constructing provoked by editorial cartoons that invoke several conceptual domains to define and evaluate their topic, Iwo Jima cartoons being cases in point. The second section introduces the relevant aspects of Blending theory: mental spaces and types of blending networks. The third section addresses the Iwo Jima image as one particular input space; a moral criterion to which the selected sociopolitical topic of the cartoon is compared and judged. The fourth section isolates four types of graphic operations blending the Iwo Jima image with topical entities. The fifth section demonstrates how various kinds of blends give rise to either positive or negative evaluations. The final section argues that the study's scope of application extends to any kind of multi-domain cartoon, not just those addressed in this article. © 2013 Copyright Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Benoit, W., Klyukovski, A., McHale, J., Airne, D., A fantasy theme analysis of political cartoons on the Clinton-Lewinsky-Starr affair (2001) Critical Studies in Media Communication, 18, pp. 377-394; Bergen, B., To awaken a sleeping giant: Cognition and culture in September 11 political cartoons (2003) Language, culture and mind, pp. 1-11. , In: Archard M., Kemmer S., editors Stanford, CA, Stanford, CA, CSLI Publications; Bertelsen, L., Icons on Iwo (2004) Journal of Popular Culture, 22, pp. 79-95; Biederman, I., Recognition-by-components: A theory of human image understanding (1987) Psychological Review, 94, pp. 115-147; Bostdorff, D.M., Making light of James Watt: A Burkean approach to the form and attitude of political cartoons (1987) Quarterly Journal of Speech, 73, pp. 43-59; Brandt, L., Brandt, P.A., Making sense of a blend (2002) Apparatur, 4, pp. 62-71; Cohn, N., A visual lexicon (2007) The Public Journal of Semiotics, 1, pp. 35-56; Cohn, N., The limits of time and transitions: Challenges to theories of sequential image comprehension (2010) Studies in Comics, 1, pp. 127-147; Cohn, N., Explaining ""I can't draw"": Parallels between the structure and development of language and drawing (2012) Human Development, 55, pp. 167-192; Coulson, S., What's so funny?

Existing work suggests early emergence of metaphorical abilities, with five-year-olds understanding and explaining metaphors that involve cross-domain comparisons (e.g., SPACE to TIME). Yet relatively little is known about the factors that explain this developmental change. This study focuses on spatial metaphors for time, and asks whether cognitive and/or verbal factors best explain developmental changes in three- to six-year-old children's comprehension and explanation of metaphors. The results show that children's grasp of the time concept-but not verbal ability-predicts their metaphor comprehension. Verbal ability, on the other hand, is a predictor of metaphor explanation, even after controlling for age. The results thus suggest that cognitive and verbal factors selectively predict children's emerging metaphorical abilities. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,"Georgia State University, GSU","The writing of this article was supported by a fellowship from Georgia State University’s Areas of Focus Initiative: Research on the Challenges of Acquiring Language & Literacy to Lauren J.

For a nonliteral utterance-interpretation to be favored by default, utterances should be potentially ambiguous between literal and nonliteral interpretations. They should therefore be (a) unfamiliar, (b) free of semantic anomaly or any kind of internal incongruity, and (c) unbiased by contextual information. Experiments 1-3 demonstrate that negative utterances, meeting these 3 conditions, were interpreted metaphorically (This is not a safe) or sarcastically (Ambitious she is not) when presented in isolation and were therefore processed faster in contexts strongly biasing them toward their nonliteral than toward their (equally biased) literal interpretation. Experiment 4 reduces the possibility that it is structural markedness on its own that induces nonliteralness. Two corpus-based studies provide corroborating evidence, supporting the view of negation as an operator generating nonliteral interpretations by default. © 2013 Copyright Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,"Israel Science Foundation, ISF: 436/12

There is a debate between scholars who suggest that many metaphors are based on, or derive from, metonymies, versus those who do not see such connection between the two. ""Resemblance metaphors"" do not seem to have anything to do with metonymy. However, in the case of ""correlation metaphors"" (see, e.g., Grady, 1997a, 1997b, 1999; Lakoff & Johnson, 1980, 1999), several researchers argue that metaphors arise from, and are not independent of, metonymies. My specific proposal in the article is that correlation-based metaphors emerge from frame-like mental representations through a metonymic stage. I suggest this happens when one of the elements of a frame-like mental structure is generalized (schematized) to a concept that lies outside the initial frame in a different part of the conceptual system. The generalization process leads to sufficient conceptual distance between the initial and the new frame on which metaphors can be based. © 2013 Copyright Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Andor, J., On the psychological relevance of frames (1985) Quaderni di Semantica, 6 (2), pp. 212-221; Barcelona, A., On the plausibility of claiming a metonymic motivation for conceptual metaphor (2000) Metaphor and metonymy at the crossroads, pp. 32-58. , In: Barcelona A., editors Berlin, Germany, Berlin,: Mouton de Gruyter; Barsalou, L., Perceptual symbol systems (1999) Behavioral and Brain Sciences, 22, pp. 577-609; Benczes, R., Barcelona, A., Ruiz de Mendoza Ibanez, F.J., (2012) Defining metonymy in cognitive linguistics: Towards a consensus view, , Amsterdam, The Netherlands, Amsterdam,: John Benjamins; Brdar, M., Brdar Szabó, R., When Zidane is not simply Zidane, and Bill Gates is not just Bill Gates: Or, some thoughts on online construction of metaphtonymic meanings of proper names (2007) Aspects of meaning construction, pp. 125-142. , In: Radden G., öpcke K.-M.

In this article, we draw from Linell's (2009) typology of ""recontextualization"" in order to analyze the development of particular metaphors in three pairs of linked texts, each produced over a number of years, on the topics of medicine, politics and the parenting of children with special needs. We show how key metaphorical expressions from earlier texts or conversations are re-used by later writers, in different genres and registers, to convey new meanings and serve new functions. We account for these new meanings and functions by considering the relevant domain of activity and the differences between the original context of use and the context(s) in which the metaphor is re-used. Our study contributes, from a diachronic perspective, to the growing body of literature that recognizes the dynamic and context-bound nature of metaphorical language. © 2013 Copyright Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Bakhtin, M., (1981) The dialogic imagination: Four essays, , In: Holquist M., Emerson C., editors Austin, Austin,: University of Texas Press; Barton, D., (2007) Literacy: An introduction to the ecology of written language, , Oxford, UK, Oxford,: Blackwell; Bernstein, B., (1996) Pedagogy, symbolic control and identity: Theory, research, critique, , Lanham, MD, Lanham, MD,: Rowman & Littlefield; Bhatia, V., (1993) Analysing genre: Language use in professional settings, , London, UK, London,: Longman; Boyd, R., Metaphor and theory change: What is ""metaphor"" a metaphor for?

Because of the alleged paucity of sensory vocabularies, in particular in the olfactory domain, it is of particular interest to investigate what resources language has to offer in order to describe those experiences. We show that the main resources are, on the one hand, words evoking properties that are applicable cross-modally and properties of objects that range over more than one domain, and on the other, vivid imagery that compares the characteristics of the wine with people, buildings, animals, and the hustle and bustle of market places and other events. The second goal is to account for the construals of the meanings of the expressions used in the recontextualization into written discourse in the light of their apparent flexibility across the descriptions of the sensory experiences. In contrast to a large body of the literature on sensory meanings in language, we argue that the descriptors of properties such as sharp, soft, lemon, and cherry used to describe a wine's qualities across the sensory domains are not polysemous synesthetic metaphors, but monosemous synesthetic metonymizations, more precisely zone activations. With regard to the imagery used, the construals represented cover both similes, metaphorizations and metonymizations proper. © 2013 Copyright Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Barsalou, L., Grounded cognition (2008) Annual Review of Psychology, 59, pp. 617-645; Binder, J.R., Desai, R.H., The neurobiology of semantic memory (2011) Trends in Cognitive Sciences, 15 (11), pp. 527-536; Burenhult, N., Majid, A., Olfaction in Aslian ideology and language (2011) Senses & Society, 6 (1), pp. 19-29; Caballero, R., Manner-of-motion verbs in wine description (2007) Journal of Pragmatics, 39 (12), pp. 2095-2114; Caballero, R., Cutting across the senses.

Two metaphors are analyzed and contrasted in two different communities and times: signs of a positive change are green shoots in Spanish newspapers throughout 2009, and obstacles for success are an ash cloud in the British press in 2010. Because these metaphors emerged in different sociocultural, political and geographical contexts, in different languages, and in different discursive communities, each underwent a distinct development, degree of expansion and divergent pragmatic and semantic changes. Both metaphors are paradigmatic examples of genre re-contextualization (Linell, 2009; Linell & Sarangi, 1998; Semino, 2011) and of semantic change in progress. © 2013 Copyright Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,"Ministerio de Ciencia e InnovaciÃ³n, MICINN: FFI2009–13582","This article is part of a larger project, “Narration, Discourse, and Cognition,” funded by the Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation (FFI2009–13582).",,"Aitchison, J., (1991) Language change.

Camilo Jose Cela s/n, 13071 Ciudad Real, Spain","Metaphor is a critical component in architecture where it mediates the various stages involved in architectural design as well as the discussion on finished buildings in post-construction genres. In this regard, although metaphor appears to be mostly used in a conventional, unconscious way, architects also use it deliberately to discuss their work in the different genres articulating architectural discourse. In short, the metaphors found in architectural discourse not only reveal ways in which architects conceptualize space, but also work as tools for communicating their work to others. My main concern in this article is to discuss how metaphor is used by architects throughout the aforementioned design stages in three different genres, namely architects' texts reflecting upon their design, scholarly articles, and architectural reviews. The discussion focuses on six texts illustrating the aforementioned genres and dealing with a single building designed by Berlin-based architect Zvi Hecker. By using these data, I will attempt to show how metaphor is used, re-used and further elaborated (i.e., re-contextualized) by architects in the thinking and discursive endeavors involved in their work. © 2013 Copyright Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Andrus, J., Beyond texts in context: Recontextualization and the co-production of texts and contexts in the legal discourse, excited utterance exception to hearsay (2011) Discourse and Society, 22 (2), pp. 115-136; Arnheim, R., (1969) Visual thinking.

The case-study is concerned with theory of metaphorical constraint, but is argued to have wider implications. It begins with a survey of the Greco-Roman tradition, which tends to confine metaphor to likeness. It is argued that also the dissimilar parts can affect the aesthetic value of metaphors in certain contexts of communication. Examples are drawn from skaldic poetry since this genre presupposes a metaphorical thinking which differs from that found in classical aesthetics. The skaldic metaphors in question appear to demand a violation of the principles of metaphorical constraint put forth in conceptual integration theory (blending). It is proposed that the reason for this is that blending is based on aesthetics of classical learning, while skaldic metaphors adhere to different aesthetic principles.

Our aim in this article is to explore the temporal characteristics of how conceptual metaphors shape verbal metaphor use. We argue that cognitive linguistics and psycholinguistics mostly adopt simplistic, and psychologically implausible, views of how conceptual metaphors are activated and then constrain people's comprehension of metaphoric language. But more contemporary ideas on how cognitive processing unfolds over time in human experience provide better models of how conceptual metaphors shape verbal metaphor use. The implications of this newer vision of CMT are discussed, particularly in regard to methods for studying how conceptual metaphors support interpretation of linguistic metaphor. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Cameron, L., (2011) Metaphor and reconciliation: The discourse dynamics of empathy in post-conflict conversations, , London, UK: Routledge; Cienki, A., Müller, C., (2008) Metaphor and gesture, , Amsterdam, The Netherlands: Benjamins; Gibbs, R., (1994) The poetics of mind: Figurative thought, language, and understanding, , New York, NY: Cambridge University Press; Gibbs, R., (2008) The Cambridge handbook of metaphor and thought, , New York, NY: Cambridge University Press; Gibbs, R., Evaluating conceptual metaphor theory (2011) Discourse Processes, 48, pp. 529-562; Gibbs, R., Multiple constraints on theories of metaphor (2011) Discourse Processes, 48, pp. 375-584; Gibbs, R., Cameron, L., Social-cognitive dynamics of metaphor performance (2007) Cognitive Systems Research, 9, pp. 64-75; Gibbs, R., Colston, H., (2012) Interpreting figurative meaning, , New York, NY: Cambridge University Press; Katz, A., Blasko, D., Kamzerski, V., Saying what you don't mean: Social influences on language processing (2004) Current Directions in Psychological Science, 13, pp. 186-189; Kövecses, Z., (2002) Metaphor: A practical introduction, , New York, NY: Oxford University Press; Lakoff, G., Johnson, M., (1980) Metaphors we live by, , Chicago, IL: University of Chicago Press; Lakoff, G., Johnson, M., (1999) Philosophy in the flesh, , Chicago, IL: University of Chicago Press; MacDonald, M., Seidenberg, M., Constraint satisfaction accounts of lexical and sentence comprehension (2006) Handbook of psycholinguistics, pp. 581-611. , In: Traxler M., Gernsbacher M., editors 2nd, London, UK: Elsevier; Müller, C., (2008) Metaphors dead and alive, sleeping and waking: A dynamic view, , Chicago, IL: University of Chicago Press; Pickering, M., Garrod, S., Toward a mechanistic psychology of dialogue (2004) Behavioral and Brain Science, 27, pp. 169-225; Ruiz de Mendoza, F., Perez, L., Cognitive operations and pragmatic implication (2003) Metonymy and pragmatic inferencing, pp. 23-49. , In: Panther K., Thornberg L., editors Amsterdam, The Netherlands: Benjamins; Shockley, K., Richardson, D., Dale, R., Conversation and coordinative structures (2009) Topics in Cognitive Science, 1, pp. 305-319; Spivey, M., (2007) The continuity of mind, , New York, NY: Oxford University Press; Tendahl, M., Gibbs, R., Complementary perspectives on metaphor: Cognitive linguistics and relevance theory (2008) Journal of Pragmatics, 40, pp. 1823-1864; Yu, N., (2008) The Chinese heart in a cognitive perspective: Culture, body, and language, , Berlin, Germany: Mouton","Gibbs, R.

This characterization, while useful for some purposes, is nevertheless a misleading fallacy. It diverts attention from two matters: from the possibility of metaphor and simile being processed by different forms of comparison, and from the role of other processing occurring between surface form and mental comparison processes. Both matters, when taken into consideration, severely affect the way that the results of psychological experiments on metaphor and simile understanding are interpreted. Another, related, fallacy that has been current is a set of claims about whether simile and/or literal comparisons can be paraphrased into copular form or vice versa. This fallacy has, for instance, been used to support a distinction between simile and literal comparison. The article does not support or attack any particular type of theory of metaphor or simile understanding, but instead clarifies the space of theoretical possibilities and introduces added caution into the interpretation of relevant experiments. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,"Leverhulme Trust: EP/C538943/1

We predicted that salience-based lexical meaning initially activates the literal representation of an ironic utterance. This is immediately followed by the activation of the ironic representation supported by the automatic interaction between salience-based lexical meaning and egocentric context. Finally, overall interpretation is achieved by incorporating the information from Theory of Mind, which is provided by effortful processing. Salience-based representations are retained rather than suppressed. Cognitive load prevents incorporating the allocentric information given by Theory of Mind, resulting in an egocentric interpretation. The experimental results supported our hypothesis: both ironic representations (Experiment 1) and salience-based literal representations (Experiment 2a) become active early on. Cognitive load prevented the deactivation of unintended ironic representations (Experiment 3) and did not affect the retention of salience-based representations (Experiment 4).

In the categorization, the vehicle in a metaphor activates the metaphor-relevant meaning, but suppresses the metaphor-irrelevant meaning. However, the relationships between the strength of activation/suppression and the factors that predict the categorization have not been sufficiently examined. In addition, the previous studies did not show the meaning process of topic in metaphor comprehension. Our two experiments examined the meaning process of both topic and vehicle in metaphor comprehension by using a priming method and a meaningfulness decision task. Our experiments revealed that only the highly interactive metaphor with highly conventional vehicle activates the metaphor-relevant meaning in the vehicle, but that all metaphors suppress the metaphor-irrelevant meaning. We also revealed that the topic both as metaphor-relevant meaning and as metaphor-irrelevant meaning is activated in metaphor comprehension. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,"Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, JSPS: 23300098",,,"Allbritton, D., McKoon, G., Gerrig, R., Metaphor-based schemas and text representations: Making connections through conceptual metaphors (1995) Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition, 21 (3), pp. 612-625; Blasko, D., Connine, C.M., Effects of familiarity and aptness on metaphor processing (1993) Journal of Experimental Psychology.

It also compares the types of metaphor of men and women talking about depression and how these metaphors were used in discourse so as to determine whether or not the expression of depression is gendered. The types of metaphor used by women and men are generally similar (""descent,"" ""weight and pressure"" and ""darkness and light"" metaphors) and there is a large group of metaphors relating to containment and constraint for which there is only limited evidence in previous research. This leads to a model for depression in which the self is ""contained"" within a depression but also ""contains"" sad feelings that are trapped. There are some interesting differences between genders in how metaphors are used with greater evidence of metaphor priming and metaphor mixing in the interviews with women. Expression of these ""trapped"" feelings may be an important part of the process of recovery and metaphor priming and mixing may facilitate this. Therapists should encourage clients to use diverse metaphors to convey the intensity of their emotions even if the feelings they convey are negative ones. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Angus, L.E., Rennie, D., Therapist participation in metaphor generation: collaborative and noncollaborative styles (1988) Psychotherapy, 25, pp. 552-560; Angus, L.E., Rennie, D., Envisioning the representational world: Metaphoric express ion in psychotherapy relationships (1989) Psychotherapy, 26, pp. 372-379; Barcelona, A., On the concept of depression in American English: A cognitive approach (1986) Revista Canaria de Estudios Ingleses, 12, pp. 7-33; Burns, W., (2007) Healing with stories, , Hoboken, NJ: Wiley & Sons; Bury, M., Chronic illness as biographical disruption (1982) Sociology of Health and Illness, 4, pp. 167-182; Charteris-Black, J., (2004) Corpus approaches to critical metaphor analysis, , Basingstoke, UK and New York, NY: Palgrave-MacMillan; Charteris-Black, J., Seale, C., (2010) Gender and the language of illness, , Basingstoke, UK and New York, NY: Palgrave-MacMillan; Emslie, C., Ridge, D., Ziebland, S., Hunt, K., Men's accounts of depression: Reconstructing or resisting hegemonic masculinity?

The most typical and revealing instances of living metaphor are not poetic rewordings of shared and consistent metaphorical concepts but textual interpretations of conflictual meanings of complex expressions. Conflictual metaphors document the creative potential of linguistic expressions and shed light on the structure of metaphorical transfer and projection. Moreover, the complex network of inferences triggered by a living metaphor may generate a set of conflictual expressions consistent with it-a ""metaphorical swarm""-which is open to empirical investigation. The final section of this article is an illustration of the metaphorical swarm of liquid light in English Romanticism and French Symbolism. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Barcelona, A., Introduction.

This article examines promotional discourse related to geoengineering from the 1980s to 2010. It asks in particular how this option for dealing with the problems posed by climate change were framed through the use of conceptual and discourse metaphors and whether one can argue that these are metaphors we ""live by"" or metaphors we might ""die by."" Findings show that an overarching argument from catastrophe was bolstered by three conceptual master-metaphors, namely ""THE PLANET IS A BODY,"" ""THE PLANET IS A MACHINE,"" and ""THE PLANET IS A PATIENT/ADDICT,"" linked to a variety of discourse metaphors, older conceptual metaphors, and clichés. This metaphorical landscape began to shift while the article was being written and will have to be closely monitored in the future. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,"Economic and Social Research Council, ESRC: ES/I014926/1",,,"(2010) Ancient volcanoes drained ocean of oxygen, , February 7, New Scientist February 7, 16; (2010) Are climate schemes barmy or brilliant?, 414, pp. 26-27. , July 31, ENDS Report; Beck, U., (1992) Risk society: Towards a new modernity, , London, UK: Sage; Bonnheim, N.B., History of climate engineering (2010) Wiley Interdisciplinary Reviews: Climate Change, 1 (6), pp. 891-897; (2011) Task force on Climate Remediation Research: Geoengineering: A national strategic plan for research on the potential effectiveness, feasibility, and consequences of climate remediation technologies, , http://www.bipartisanpolicy.org/sites/default/files/BPC%20Climate%20Remediation%20Final%20Report.pdf, Bipartisan Policy Center, Retrieved from; Brahic, C., Earth's Plan B: We may soon have no choice but to fiddle with the climate-but are we ready?

The purpose is to demonstrate heteroglossia created by this metaphoric proposition. The article seeks to explore the variation of themes and social implications evoked by the same metaphoric concept. Various social agents adopt and adapt the metaphor to achieve dissimilar communicative and ideological goals. Receivers of the metaphoric message do not react uniformly to the proposition either. Multiple voices are involved in negotiation of values and ideas associated with the metaphor usage. The play of voices around the metaphoric proposition extends, reverses, twists and truncates the mapping of the metaphoric paragon. The article concludes with the discussion of discursive techniques which enable metaphor producer to enlarge or alter the scope of metaphoric inferences. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"A'Beckett, L., The stance of Russian mass media on the Ukrainian Orange Revolution (2007) Transcultural Studies: A Series in Interdisciplinary Research, 2-3, pp. 217-244; A'Beckett, L., Onomastic allusions in the Russian press: Multiple facets of the Russian Terminator (2009) Proceedings of the Second International Perspectives on Slavistics Conference, pp. 3-16. , In: Birzer S., Finkelstein M., Mendoza I., editors Munich, Germany: Otto Sagner; Bakhtin, M.M., (1981) The dialogic imagination, , In: Emerson C., Holquist M., editors Austin: University of Texas Press Trans; (2008) The press in Russia, , http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4315129.stm, BBC Monitoring, BBC News.

We use the idea of ""iconic superstructure"" to consider the way that metaphoric meaning is generated through the iconic properties of creative sign language. We focus on the interaction between the overall contextual force and individual elements that build up symbolism in sign language poetry. Evidence presented from the anthology of British Sign Language poetry demonstrates that metaphoric meaning is not inherent in signs. What is inherent is iconic value-and purely iconic signs become metaphorical when situated in a certain poetic context. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,"Arts and Humanities Research Council, AHRC: AH/G011672/1",,,"Bouvet, D., (1997) Le corps et la métaphore dans les langues gestuelles: À la recherche des modes de production des signes [The body and metaphor in gestural languages: In search of the modes of production of signs], , Paris, France: L'Harmattan; Brennan, M., (1990) Word formation in British Sign Language, , Stockholm: University of Stockholm; Crasborn, O., Kooij, E., Nonhebel, A., Emmerik, W., (2004) ECHO data set for Sign Language of the Netherlands (NGT), , http://www.let.ru.nl/sign-lang/echo, Department of Linguistics, Radboud University Nijmegen.

Young Drive South, Los Angeles, CA 90095, United States","Individuals with ASD show consistent impairment in processing pragmatic language when attention to multiple social cues (e.g., facial expression, tone of voice) is often needed to navigate social interactions. Building upon prior fMRI work examining how facial affect and prosodic cues are used to infer a speaker's communicative intent, the authors examined whether children and adolescents with ASD differ from typically developing (TD) controls in their processing of sincere versus ironic remarks. At the behavioral level, children and adolescents with ASD and matched TD controls were able to determine whether a speaker's remark was sincere or ironic equally well, with both groups showing longer response times for ironic remarks. At the neural level, for both sincere and ironic scenarios, an extended cortical network-including canonical language areas in the left hemisphere and their right hemisphere counterparts-was activated in both groups, albeit to a lesser degree in the ASD sample. Despite overall similar patterns of activity observed for the two conditions in both groups, significant modulation of activity was detected when directly comparing sincere and ironic scenarios within and between groups. While both TD and ASD groups showed significantly greater activity in several nodes of this extended network when processing ironic versus sincere remarks, increased activity was largely confined to left language areas in TD controls, whereas the ASD sample showed a more bilateral activation profile which included both language and ""theory of mind"" areas (i.e., ventromedial prefrontal cortex). These findings suggest that, for high-functioning individuals with ASD, increased activity in right hemisphere homologues of language areas in the left hemisphere, as well as regions involved in social cognition, may reflect compensatory mechanisms supporting normative behavioral task performance. © 2012 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,"National Institutes of Health, NIH

We face a major challenge in achieving an appropriate level of focus as we move between a perspective on the development of specifically linguistic functioning among children with autism, and concern with broader atypicalities in these individuals' social-relational and communicative engagement. This challenge is illustrated by the need to clarify what we mean when we refer to ""literal language"" and ""concrete thinking"" among persons with autism. © 2012 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"(1994) Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders, , Washington, DC: Author American Psychiatric Association; Baltaxe, C.A.M., Pragmatic deficits in the language of autistic adolescents (1977) Journal of Pediatric Psychology, 2, pp. 176-180; Baltaxe, C.A.M., Simmons, J.Q., Bedtime soliloquies and linguistic competence in autism (1977) Journal of Speech and Hearing Disorders, 42, pp. 376-393; Baron-Cohen, S., Tager-Flusberg, H., Cohen, D.J., (2000) Understanding other minds: Perspectives from developmental cognitive neuroscience, , New York, NY: Oxford University Press; Bosch, G., (1970) Infantile autism, , New York, NY: Springer-Verlag; Brown, R., Hobson, R.P., Lee, A., Stevenson, J., Are there 'autistic-like' features in congenitally blind children?

Despite empirical evidence to the contrary, three of the four contributions to this special issue endorse this stereotype without question. And all four contributions attribute this supposed deficit to even shakier fallacies, such as the controversial claim that autistic people lack empathy or a ""theory of mind."" In this commentary, we begin by reviewing the literature more exhaustively than the other contributions, and we highlight a point that they missed: Autistic persons are likely to have difficulty comprehending figurative language if they also have difficulty comprehending language in general. There doesn't seem to be a specific deficit in figurative language unique to autism. We also tackle the claim that autistic people lack empathy. And we question the existence of a ""theory of mind area"" while demonstrating the pitfalls that ensnarl researchers when they strain to interpret differences between autistic and non-autistic brain activity as solely autistic deficits. © 2012 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Anderson, J.S., Druzgal, T.J., Froehlich, A., DuBray, M.B., Lange, N., Alexander, A.L., Lainhart, J.E., Decreased interhemispheric functional connectivity in autism (2011) Cerebral Cortex, 21, pp. 1134-1146; Baron-Cohen, S., Hey!

We suggest that semantic processing involves both rule-based and rule violating aspects. These two poles of semantic processing are represented by literal and novel metaphoric expressions, respectively. Literal comprehension requires straightforward, conventional, familiar and predictable association between concepts, thus representing relatively systemized, rule-based, linguistic functions. As opposed to this, the comprehension of novel metaphoric combinations is based on the ability to process new, abstract and relatively unpredictable associations. Thus novel metaphor comprehension involves creation of new associations that might violate the rules underlying literal comprehension. These two aspects of language processing are elaborated and discussed in light of previous research on hemispheric involvement during semantic processing in healthy individuals as well as research on language processing in AS. © 2012 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,"Israel Science Foundation, ISF: 724/09","This research was supported by the Israel Science Foundation (ISF) grant (number 724/09) to Miriam Faust.",,"(2000) Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders, , Washington, DC: Author American Psychiatric Association; Arzouan, Y., Goldstein, A., Faust, M., Brainwaves are stethoscopes: ERP correlates of novel metaphor comprehension (2007) Brain research, 1160, pp. 69-81; Arzouan, Y., Goldstein, A., Faust, M., Dynamics of hemispheric activity during metaphor comprehension: Electrophysiological measures (2007) NeuroImage, 36, pp. 222-231; Attwood, T., (1998) Asperger's syndrome: A guide for parents and professionals, , London, UK: Jessica Kingsley; Baron-Cohen, S., (1995) Mindblindness: An essay on autism and theory of mind, , Cambridge, MA: MIT Press; Baron-Cohen, S., (2003) The essential difference: Men, women and the extreme male brain, , New York, NY: Basic Books; Baron-Cohen, S., Tager-Flusberg, H., Cohen, D., (2000) Understanding other minds: Perspectives from developmental neuroscience, , Oxford, UK: Oxford University Press; Bennett, T., Szatmari, P., Bryson, S., Volden, J., Zwaigenbaum, L., Vaccarella, L., Boyle, M., Differentiating autism and Asperger Syndrome on the basis of language delay or impairment (2008) Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders, 38, pp. 616-625; Berger, H., van Spaendonck, K., Horstink, M., Buytenhuijs, E., Lammers, P., Cools, A., Cognitive shifting as a predictor of progress in social understanding in high-functioning adolescents with autism: A prospective study (1993) Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders, 23, pp. 341-359; Bowdle, B.F., Gentner, D., The career of metaphor (2005) Psychological Review, 112, pp. 193-216; Coulson, S., Van Petten, C., Conceptual integration and metaphor: An event-related potential study (2002) Memory and Cognition, 30, pp. 958-968; Dascal, M., Language as a cognitive technology (2002) International Journal of Cognition and Technology, 1 (1), pp. 35-61; Dennis, M., Lazenby, A.L., Lockyer, L., Inferential language in high-functioning children with autism (2001) Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders, 31 (1), pp. 47-54; Dimbort, D., Heid, M.D., DeMartini Producers., F., Næss Director., P., Mozart and the whale [Motion picture], , United States: Nu Image; Fainsilber, L., Ortony, A., Metaphorical uses of language in the expression of emotions (1987) Metaphor and Symbol, 2 (4), pp. 239-250; Faust, M., Thinking outside the left box: The role of the right hemispheres in novel metaphor comprehension (2012) Advances in the neural substrates of language: Toward a synthesis of basic science and clinical research, pp. 425-448. , In: Faust M., editors Malden, MA: Wiley-Blackwell; Faust, M., Mashal, N., The role of the right cerebral hemisphere in processing novel metaphoric expressions taken from poetry: A divided visual field study (2007) Neuropsychologia, 45, pp. 860-870; Gallagher, S., The practice of mind: Theory, simulation, or primary interaction?

According to the received view, individuals with AS are biased toward the literal and are insensitive to contextual cues. According to the graded salience hypothesis (Giora, 1997, 2003), participants with AS and controls would be sensitive to both context and degree of salience rather than to degree of nonliterality. Our results show that while individuals with AS generally performed worse than controls, their overall pattern of response was similar to that of controls: both groups performed worse on novel than on familiar expressions, whether literal or metaphorical; both groups benefited from context, which reduced response times and error rates on novel but not on familiar metaphors; both groups rated negative utterances as more metaphoric than their affirmative counterparts. Individuals with AS, then, are sensitive to context and degree of salience and are not biased toward the literal. © 2012 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,"Israel Science Foundation, ISF: 652/07

Shape is considered one of the primary vehicles for object categorization. We hypothesize that similarity in shape facilitates finding conceptual correspondences between objects, both for objects stemming from the same and from different conceptual categories. In the latter case, the comparison process requires the construction of an ad hoc category, which is also required when interpreting visual metaphors. We used three experimental tasks to investigate the role of shape in comparing objects: a similarity judgment task, a similarity rating task, and a production task. The results of our experiments support the hypothesis that an essential component of visual metaphor processing-comparing objects stemming from disparate conceptual domains-is positively affected by similarity in the objects' shape. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,"Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek, NWO","This research is part of the project “Visual Metaphor: A Psycholinguistic Perspective,” which is funded by an “Open Competition” grant from the Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO).",,"Barsalou, L.W., Ad hoc categories (1983) Memory & Cognition, 11, pp. 211-227; Barsalou, L.W., Deriving categories to achieve goals (1991) The Psychology of Learning and Motivation: Advances In Research and Theory, pp. 1-64. , In G.

The Beijing 2008 Olympics' motto was ""One World, One Dream,"" which highlights the notion of the world as a ""global village."" The commercial converges on this motto with a metaphorical imagery of a bird's nest being built by birds from all over the world. While ""bird's nest"" is commonly mapped metaphorically onto some target concepts, such as ""unity"" and ""harmony,"" the metaphorical imagery is also motivated by the fact that the Beijing National Stadium looks like a bird's nest, and is therefore nicknamed ""the Bird's Nest."" It is argued that the commercial is structured by one central metaphor, a metaphorical compound, manifested multimodally through the multimodal discourse: ""PEOPLES OF THE WORLD MAKING CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE BEIJING OLYMPICS ARE BIRDS FLYING FROM VARIOUS COUNTRIES TO BEIJING WITH TWIGS TO BUILD A BIRD'S NEST."" The study applies a decompositional approach to metaphorical compound analysis (DAMCA) based on the distinction between primary and complex metaphors. The analysis shows that the highly specific and complex metaphorical compound is actually built upon a general cognitive foundation comprising the Great Chain and Event Structure Metaphor systems. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Cienki, A., Müller, C., Metaphor, gesture, and thought (2008) The Cambridge Handbook of Metaphor and Thought, pp. 483-501. , In R.

In the indirect categorization process, the verb (e.g., fly) of a predicative metaphor evokes an intermediate entity, which in turn evokes a metaphoric category of actions or states (e.g., ""to spread rapidly and soon disappear"") to be attributed to the target noun (e.g., rumor), rather than directly evoking a metaphoric category as argued by Glucksberg's (2001) categorization theory. We test our argument using two experiments, namely, offline comprehension and online priming. The offline comprehension experiment showed that interpretation of predicative metaphors had greater overlap with words indirectly associated with the verb than those directly associated with the verb. The online priming experiment demonstrated that indirectly associated words were activated during predicative metaphor comprehension, but directly associated words were not. These results provide convergent evidence for our argument, and thus the psychological validity of two-stage categorization as a process of predicative metaphor comprehension was confirmed. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,"Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, JSPS: 23300098

Results from recent experiments - in which people think about motion, which in turn influences their thinking about time - support this position. Still, many questions remain about the nature of the metaphorical connection between time and space. Can the mere suggestion of motion influence how people reason about time, and if so, when and how? Three experiments investigated how thinking about ""abstract"" motion through sequences of numbers or letters would influence reasoning about time. Our results extend earlier psychological work on the link between time and space by showing that even motion in non-physical domains can influence temporal reasoning. The results provide further evidence that metaphorical understanding is grounded in our everyday physical and conceptual experience. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Boroditsky, L., Metaphoric structuring: Understanding time through spatial metaphors (2000) Cognition, 75, pp. 1-28; Boroditsky, L., Ramscar, M., The roles of body and mind in abstract thought (2002) Psychological Science, 13, pp. 185-188; Cantlon, J.F., Platt, M.L., Brannon, E.M., Beyond the number domain (2009) Trends In Cognitive Sciences, 13, pp. 83-91; Casarotti, M., Michielin, M., Zorzi, M., Umiltà, C., Temporal order judgment reveals how number magnitude affects visuospatial attention (2006) Cognition, 102, pp. 101-117; Casasanto, D., Boroditsky, L., Time in the mind: Using space to think about time (2008) Cognition, 106, pp. 579-593; Clark, H.H., Space, time, semantics, and the child (1973) Cognitive Development and The Acquisition of Language, , In T.

Eighty-two participants heard short stories read in a monotone voice reflecting either a positive or a negative context, followed by a relevant statement in a sarcastic or sincere tone of voice. Context and tone of voice were either congruent (e.g., positive context with sincere tone) or incongruent (e.g., positive context with sarcastic tone). Participants were asked to rate from 1 to 7 whether they perceived the statement as very sincere (1) or very sarcastic (7). Results indicated a significant context by tone interaction on both ratings and response time. Specifically, mid-range ratings and longer reaction times were obtained when context and tone were incongruent compared to when they were congruent. The discussion emphasizes the interplay of context and tone of voice in the perception of a sarcastic statement.",,,,,,,"Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada, NSERC","The study reported here was supported by a grant from the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada to Daniel Voyer.

It is argued that much of this criticism arises from common misconceptions as to the real claims made by the theory. However, CTM is still in need of further exploration and empirical support. In this connection, we identify some areas where research is still needed and supply our own developments. We argue for a more complex classification of metaphor types, which takes into account various complementary taxonomic perspectives, including the nature of source and target and the genericity and complexity of the metaphoric operation. We also explore metaphor in relation to cognitive prominence and conceptual interaction issues. Finally, we deal with the problem of constraints on metaphor and make a proposal for three complementary kinds of constraint. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,"This research has been carried out at the Center for Research in the Applications of Language (CRAL), University of La Rioja, with financial support from Project No. FFI2010-17610, Ministry of Science and Innovation, Spain.",,"Caballero, R., Talking about space: Image metaphor in architectural discourse (2003) Annual Review of Cognitive Linguistics, 1, pp. 87-105; Caballero, R., (2006) Re-viewing Space: Figurative Language In Architects' Assessment of Built Space, , Berlin, Germany: Mouton de Gruyter; Croft, W., The role of domains in the interpretation of metaphors and metonymies (1993) Cognitive Linguistics, 4, pp. 335-370; Deignan, A., Image"" metaphors and connotations in everyday language (2007) Annual Review of Cognitive Linguistics, 5, pp. 173-192; Dirven, R., de Mendoza, F.J.R., Looking back at 30 years of cognitive linguistics (2010) Cognitive Linguistics In Action: From Theory to Application and Back, pp. 13-70. , In E.

The first section discusses previous operationalizations of irony and demonstrates that these are not explicit about which criteria were used to separate irony from non-irony. The second section argues why irony can be defined as an ""utterance with a literal evaluation that is implicitly contrary to its intended evaluation."" This section also explains why ironic utterances can be placed on an evaluation scale. In the third section, clauses are proposed as a good unit of analysis when looking at irony in natural discourse. The different steps of the VIP are then introduced in the fourth section and subsequently applied in a sample analysis of a natural text in the fifth section. The sixth section discusses a reliability analysis of the VIP protocol. The article ends with an outlook on how future research on verbal irony might benefit from applying the VIP. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Must Love Dogs (2006) Sp!ts, p. 20. , Anonymous, March 16; Attardo, S., Irony as relevant inappropriateness (2000) Journal of Pragmatics, 32, pp. 793-826; Attardo, S., Irony markers and functions: Towards a goal-oriented theory of irony and its processing (2000) Rask, 12, pp. 3-20; Barbe, K., ""Isn't it ironic that"": Explicit irony markers (1993) Journal of Pragmatics, 20, pp. 579-590; Behler, E., Ironie [Irony] (1998) Historisches Wörterbuch Der Rhetorik [Historic Dictionary of Rhetoric], 4, pp. 599-624. , In G.

The study of figuration, a concern of literary critics, rhetoricians, philosophers of language, cognitive linguists and psychologists has, since the advent of Lakoff and Johnson's Metaphors We Live By (1980) been dominated by metaphor. Harris and Tolmie, and the essayists in this special issue, drawn from diverse fields, make the case for allegory as a network of genres that draws on the cognitive resources of analogy plus narrative-through devices like personification and topification, and extension of analogic frames like ""LIFE IS A JOURNEY""-making it even richer for study. Cognitive psychologist Raymond W. Gibbs, Jr., explores the allegorical impulse in everyday speech; philosopher Paul Thagard advances a multiconstraint theory of analogy and applies it to Orwell's Animal Farm; and in two collaborative papers, literary critics Madeleine Kasten and Curtis Gruenler compare Langland's Piers Plowman and Voltaire's Candide, and rhetoricians Todd Oakley and Peter Crisp compare Pilgrim's Progress and the digital video Third Race at the Honeymoon is Over Downs, deploying the resources of Fauconnier and Turner's conceptual blending theory. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Atance, C.M., O'Neill, D.K., The emergence of episodic future thinking in humans (2005) Learning and Motivation, 36, pp. 126-144; Bacon, F., (1905) The Philosophical Works of Francis Bacon, , (J.

My claim is that allegoresis is not a specialized mode of interpretation, but a fundamental human impulse to draw diverse connections between concrete and more abstract experience. I describe several empirical findings from psycholinguistics, anthropology, and literature that demonstrate people's facility to be allegorical, including individuals' consistent ability to see allegory in various texts and real-life situations. I conclude by arguing that allegory is cognitive, not as an abstract, purely mental stance or strategy, but because it relies on embodied simulations for its expression and understanding, much as do many other aspect of cognitive behavior. © Taylor & Francis Group.",,,,,,,,,,"Frost, R., (1969) The Poetry of Robert Frost, , New York: Holt, Rinehart, and Winston; Garner, J., (1994) Politically Correct Bedtime Stories, , New York: Wiley; Gibbs, R., The poetics of mind: Figurative thought, language, and understanding (1994), New York: Cambridge University Press; Gibbs, R., Embodiment and cognitive science (2006), New York: Cambridge University Press; Gibbs, R., Metaphor interpretation as embodied simulation (2006) Mind & Language, 21, pp. 434-458; Gibbs, R., Cambridge handbook of metaphor and thought (2008), New York, NY: Cambridge University Press; Gibbs, R., Boers, E., Metaphoric processing of allegorical poetry (2005) Metaphor and Culture, , Z.

What replaced it, they claimed, was Symbol, not a genre, but a new literary aesthetic. Allegory was inert and limited. Symbol was active and expansive. Scholars as diverse as Walter Benjamin, Michel Foucault, and Maureen Quilligan, have attributed this aesthetic shift to modernist secularization, to the loss of a spiritually infused picture of the material world. We contend that while the prototypical, historical genre has indeed faded, the cognitive affinities which the genre satisfied so directly continue to thrive; that the modernist aesthetic also appeals to these affinities; and that allegory is consonant with modernism.We build this argument through analyses of Piers and Voltaire's Candide, through the intersection of the Medieval figure, enigma, and Conceptual Blending Theory. © Taylor & Francis Group.",,,,,,,,,,"Aers, D., Piers plowman and christian allegory (1975), London: Arnold; Benjamin, W., (1974) Ursprung Des Deutschen Trauerspiels.

Conventionality reflects the familiarity of a metaphor whereas aptness reflects the degree to which a metaphor vehicle captures important features of a metaphor topic. In recent years it has become clear that operationalizing these two constructs is not as simple as asking naïve raters for subjective judgments. It has been found that ratings of aptness and conventionality are highly correlated, which has led some researchers to pursue alternative methods for measuring the constructs. Here, in four experiments, we explore the underlying reasons for the high correlation in ratings of aptness and conventionality, and question the construct validity of various methods for measuring the two dimensions. We find that manipulating the processing fluency of a metaphorical sentence by means of familiarization to similar senses of the metaphor (""in vivo conventionalization"") influences ratings of the sentence's aptness. This misattri-bution may help explain why subjective ratings of aptness and conventionality are highly correlated. In addition, we find other reasons to question the construct validity of conventionality and aptness measures: for instance, we find that conventionality is context dependent and thus not attributable to a metaphor vehicle alone, and we find that ratings of aptness take more into account than they should. © Taylor & Francis Group.",,,,,,,,,,"Alter, A.L., Oppenheimer, D.M., Uniting the tribes of fluency to form a metacognitive nation (2009) Personality and Social Psychology Review, 13 (3), pp. 219-235; Baayen, R.H., Davidson, D.J., Bates, D.M., Mixed-effects modeling with crossed random effects for subjects and items (2008) Journal of Memory and Language, 59, pp. 390-412; Blank, G.D., Metaphors in the lexicon (1988) Metaphor and Symbolic Activity, 3, pp. 21-36; Blasko, D.G., Connine, C.M., Effects of familiarity and aptness on metaphor processing (1993) Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition, 19, pp. 295-308; Bowdle, B.F., Gentner, D., The career of metaphor (2005) Psychological Review, 112, pp. 193-216; Chiappe, D.L., Kennedy, J.M., Aptness predicts preference for metaphors or similes, as well as recall bias (1999) Psychonomic Bulletin & Review, 6, pp. 668-676; Chiappe, D.L., Kennedy, J.M., Chiappe, P., Aptness is more important than comprehensibility in preference for metaphors and similes (2003) Poetics, 31, pp. 51-68; Chiappe, D.L., Kennedy, J.M., Smykowski, T., (2003) Reversibility, Aptness, and The Conventionality of Metaphors and Similes, 18, pp. 85-105; Clement, C., Gentner, D., Systematicity as a selection constraint in analogical mapping (1991) Cognitive Science, 15, pp. 89-132; Gentner, D., Are scientific analogies metaphors?

Past studies on conceptual metaphors for the self in Chinese have focused primarily on metaphors based on body organs such as heart and brain. Using data from nine autobiographies by Chinese writers, this study focuses on exploring motion in space as a source domain in structuring various states and understandings of the self in Chinese literary texts. The analysis shows that Chinese writers consistently draw on both vertical and horizontal motion in space in writing about themselves, and that the processes of representing states of their selves through motion verbs involve approaching or leaving normal states of the self. It is also shown that while spatial metaphors for the self used by the Chinese writers are multiple, diverse, and creative, which provides varied and meaningful systems for writers in writing about their experiences, they can be explained on the basis of the same cognitive mechanisms for metaphors in ordinary language. Finally, by examining conceptual metaphors in Chinese literary language, this study also demonstrates the need of examining conceptual metaphors in their meaningful and purposeful contexts as well as the ability of the conceptual metaphor theory in accounting for examples from stylistically marked language. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Berthele, R., The typology of motion and posture verbs: A variationist account (2004) Dialectology Meets Typology: Dialect Grammar From a Cross-linguistic Perspective, pp. 93-126. , B.

The corpus was first searched for target domain terms as well as for lexical markers indicative of metaphors. The combination of these search strategies for metaphor extraction resulted in a set of English-Spanish term pairs. After analysing and comparing these metaphor candidates, a quantitative analysis provided comparative statistical data regarding marine biology metaphor. Finally, the metaphorical nature of marine biology terms was verified in three ways. The first verification strategy entailed an adapted version of the Metaphor Identification Procedure (Pragglejaz Group, 2007). The second involved the analysis of contextual data extracted from the corpus, and the third involved the analysis of visual images from an online marine biology database and from the Google search engine. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Alexiev, B., (2005) Contrastive Aspects of Terminological Metaphor, , Unpublished doctoral dissertation.

Part of this intuition is influenced by the underlying metaphor, but another part is influenced by the linguistic expression which carries that metaphor. This paper puts forward a system, first, of dividing the two important elements which contribute to gradient intuitions of metaphoricity. These are (1) the density of the metaphor in the surface semantic content of the expression and (2) elements of the relationship between source and target in the underlying metaphor. Second, the paper puts forward a system for measuring the overall metaphoricity of an expression. This is a comparative system which can replicate intuitions that any two expressions have either equal or varying degrees of metaphoricity. The most interesting conclusion which can be drawn from intuitions of metaphoricity is that there are multiple factors with equal influence on metaphoricity. These factors can create conspiracies which disguise the strength of the underlying metaphor. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Barnden, J.A., Metaphor, semantic preferences and context-sensitivity (2007) Words and Intelligence II: Essays In Honor of Yorick Wilks, pp. 39-62. , K.

One-hundred fifty-one students were asked to identify the tone of voice in brief statements heard binaurally and intended to reflect neutral, sincere, and sarcastic tones. Participants also rated these statements on seven separate dimensions (clarity, tempo, resonance, pitch, pitch variation, intensity, and intensity variation). Results revealed that the sincere tone of voice was better identified than the sarcastic tone, which in turn was more easily identified than the neutral tone. The seven dimensions all produced significant differences in ratings among the three tones of voice. Finally, factor analysis showed six factors corresponding to characteristics of the rated dimensions. These findings support the conclusion that posed sarcasm is perceived through the integration of multiple subjective auditory features, similar to the interpretation of any other prosody. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,"Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada, NSERC","This research was made possible by research grants awarded by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) to Daniel Voyer.

Twenty interviews were conducted with people who were seeking psychological help. Another twenty interviews were conducted with Russian celebrities for publication in popular psychology magazines. Metaphors in happy stories were more numerous and diverse than in unhappy stories. Some conceptual metaphors (e.g., ""LIFE IS A CONTAINER,"" ""LIFE IS A JOURNEY,"" and ""EMOTION IS A PHYSICAL IMPACT"") were found in both happy and unhappy narratives. More specific metaphors demonstrated significant differences between the two types of narratives. The metaphors of life as a ""purposeful journey,"" self as ""alive and flexible object,"" and emotional states as ""internal and controlled forces"" were used more often in happy narratives. This may reflect higher levels of activity, responsibility, and awareness of the authors of happy narratives. Specific for unhappy stories were metaphors ""LIFE IS DEATH"" and ""SELF IS A DEAD OBJECT,"" which may indicate a low level of personal well-being and serve as specific markers of personal unhappiness. The results of our study suggest that metaphors may help to construct the subjective reality of happy and unhappy life. By telling their life stories people are able to redefine their past experiences and future perspectives. Specific metaphors play an important part in defining subjective happiness or unhappiness. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Barcelona, A., On the concept of depression in American English: A cognitive approach (1986) Revista Canaria De Estudios Ingleses, 12, pp. 7-33; Barsalou, L., Niedenthal, P.M., Barbey, A.K., Ruppert, J.A., Social embodiment (2003) The Psychology of Learning and Motivation, pp. 43-92. , In B.

Presentation of items from the same conceptual structure over n trials leads to a buildup of proactive interference that is released (leading to increased recall) on trial n+1 if a new conceptual structure is engaged. This pattern was seen when the conceptual structures were putative conceptual metaphors and cannot be attributed merely to the recall of words from different semantic categories. A group of participants given explicit instructions about the nature of the conceptual metaphoric relation of the items presented on the first n trials initially produced poorer recall than when instructions were not provided. These data provide support for the effortless activation of conceptual metaphor and an indication that conscious consideration of the conceptual underpinnings disrupts the use of that information. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,"Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada, NSERC: 06P0070","This work was supported by Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) Discovery Grant 06P0070 to the first author.",,"Gong, S., Ahrens, K., (2007) Processing Conceptual Metaphors In On-going Discourse, 22, pp. 313-330; Katz, A.N., Taylor, T.E., (2008) The Journeys of Life: Examining a Conceptual Metaphor With Semantic and Episodic Memory Recall, 23, pp. 148-174; Lakoff, G., The contemporary theory of metaphor (1993) Metaphor and Thought, , In A.

Such expressions are used metaphorically when they convey pain experiences that do not directly result from physical damage (e.g., migraine pain). In this paper, I discuss psycholinguistic and neuroscientific research that suggests that these uses of metaphor may facilitate some form of embodied simulation of pain experiences on the part of listeners/readers, which may in turn provide the basis for an empathic response. I suggest that different kinds of metaphorical descriptions of pain vary in terms of their potential for eliciting a response involving embodied simulation, and in terms of the nature and intensity of the simulation they may elicit.

A list of 10 conceptual metaphors expressing up-down movement was proposed by Lakoff and Johnson (1980), and this list has been reproduced many times since. However, this analysis shows that the list is not fully accurate. In addition to the conceptual metaphors proposed by Lakoff and Johnson, the authors find it important to include 5 more metaphorical models expressing vertical movement. On the other hand, 5 of the conceptual metaphors in Lakoff and Johnson's list turned out not to be relevant to this analysis. The authors also attempt to describe the connections between different metaphoric models and observe that not all metaphoric models are equally important in their evidential and conceptual power.

Visual cues are 1 tool known to facilitate reminding. In 2 experiments, Chinese students, who had experienced a folk tale many years ago during childhood, were asked to solve an analogous problem. We tested the hypothesis that a visual cue can help bridge the gap between a novel problem and a source analogy experienced in the distant past. Different types of cues proved to have distinct influences on components of analogical problem solving. This research suggests that analogical representational features of a story or problem can be stored in long-term memory and can be activated by visual cues. The implications of these findings for theories that point to perceptual or grounded, rather than decontextualized structures in knowledge representation are discussed. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Abed, F., Visual puns as interactive illustrations: Their effects on recognition memory (1994) Metaphor and Symbol, 9, pp. 45-60; Anderson, J.R., Farrell, R., Sauers, R., Learning to program in LISP (1984) Cognitive Science, 8, pp. 87-129; Barnett, S.M., Ceci, S.J., When and where do we apply what we learn?: A taxonomy for far transfer (2002) Psychological Bulletin, 128, pp. 612-637; Barsalou, L.W., Perceptual symbol systems (1999) Behavioral and Brain Sciences, 22, pp. 577-609; Bassok, M., Transfer of domain-specific problem-solving procedures (1990) Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory and Cognition, 16, pp. 522-533; Bauer, P.J., Hertsgaard, L.A., Wewerka, S.S., Effects of experience and reminding on long-term recall in infancy: Remembering not to forget (1995) Journal of Experimental Child Psychology, 59, pp. 260-298; Blanchette, I., Dunbar, K., Analogy use in naturalistic settings: The influence of audience.

It presents a method seeking to describe and analyze the relationship between metaphor and context of use in the financial press. Recently, critical discourse researchers and cognitive linguists have been discussing the overwhelming recourse to metaphor in the economic domain. It has been shown that the host of interrelated metaphorical expressions may not only contribute to the cohesion of the text but also be used to support an ideological agenda. Hitherto, insight has not ventured beyond the demonstration of a connection between ideology and metaphors in financial reports. The author suggests that a comprehensive model should include all the variables that act on the creation of these metaphors. The results indicate that one may predict with a satisfying degree of accuracy how and why financial or economic concepts will be assigned names or concepts from a particular source domain. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Augoustinos, M., Walker, I., (1995) Social Cognition: An Integrated Introduction, , London: Sage; Beust, P., Ferrari, S., Perlerin, V., NLP model and tools for detecting and interpreting metaphors in domainspecific corpora (2006) Proceedings of The Corpus Linguistics 2003 Conference, pp. 114-123. , In D.

Yet the pattern of brain activation during the processing of metaphors at the text level, beyond simple word pairs or sentences, is still unknown. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging to examine brain activation patterns while 15 healthy participants read either 4-line metaphoric or nonmetaphorical texts. The findings indicate that both text types showed activation in the left and right posterior and anterior superior temporal gyri. Surprisingly, metaphoric texts resulted in significantly lower activation than nonmetaphoric texts in the anterior superior temporal gyri. The results are interpreted as indicating that presentation style affects brain activation, and that text processing may rely on a complicated interaction between metaphoricity (metaphoric, nonmetaphoric) and text presentation style (poetic, prosaic). © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,"2003317","Support for this work was provided by a grant from the U.S.–Israel Binational Science Foundation (grant 2003317) to Miriam Faust.

It aims to find out the source domains in the metaphorical expressions of chat in Turkish and English and what these source domains reflect regarding the two cultures because it is believed that metaphor is not just ""in the heads"" as a figure of speech but is embodied in cultural situations, and thus, is inseparable from the cultural context with which it interacts. In doing this, the method of conceptual metaphor theory is used and the data are collected from various corpora. The study has shown that although some conceptual metaphors are shared by both sohbet and chat expressions, some of these are more dominating in sohbet than in chat or vice versa. There are also conceptual metaphors unique to sohbet. The data analysis illustrates that sohbet is more structured and conventional, requiring certain conditions, whereas chat seems to be similar to everyday conversation. Motivation for the findings is discussed with reference to cultural background and Hofstede's and Varis's culture studies. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Aksan, Y., Kantar, D., No wellness feels better than this sickness: Love metaphors from a cross-cultural perspective (2008) Metaphor and Symbol, 23, pp. 262-291; (1999) Golden Dictionary, , Arikan, N.

The model is used to hypothesize about metonymic development, indeterminacy, and chaining, and it is suggested that diachronic development, indeterminacy, and chaining follow given directional pathways along the dimensional continua. In these data, the 2 place names show converse distributions of literal and metonymic uses, and Schengen develops a range of different metonymic uses. These patterns are linked to extralinguistic political events and specific directions of category extension. Indeterminacy and chaining are also demonstrated in ways that lend support to the hypotheses presented. In including both domains and dimensions, the prototype account gives considerable leverage with regard to indeterminacy and chaining, and is also well-suited to the particular challenges posed by the Norwegian noun compounds included here. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"(2003) Metaphor and Metonymy at the Crossroads. a Cognitive Perspective, , Barcelona, A.

The findings were most robust when participants were directly asked about interlocutor gender but also were found in indirect questions about the interlocutors.

Children's production of verbal irony, however, has not previously been examined. This study was a preliminary investigation of children's irony production, including both verbal and gestural (nonverbal) forms. We coded instances of irony in interactions within 118 family triads, each consisting of 1 parent and 2 children, aged 3 to 15 years. Triads performed an 8-min cooperative task with dominos. In this context, gestural irony was used more frequently than verbal irony: 80% of the families used gestural irony at least once and 32% used verbal irony at least once. Children produced gestural irony as early as 4 years of age, and verbal irony as early as 5 years of age. Children's use of irony was not related to their general cognitive ability or vocabulary, but was related to use of irony by other members of the triad. Results suggest that social context is important to the emergence of irony production. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,"Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada, SSHRC","This research was supported by a Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada Standard Research Grant to P.M.P.",,"Allen, L., Zigler, E., Humor in children: A nonverbal humor test (1986) Journal of Applied Developmental Psychology, 7, pp. 267-276; Attardo, S., Humor and irony in interaction: From mode adoption to failure of detection (2002) Say Not to Say: New Perspectives on Miscommunication, pp. 159-179. , In L.

We examine several instances of playful metaphor, humor, and irony that occurred during a one-hour focus-group discussion among a group of scientists discussing their role in communicating about science with laypersons. During the course of this discussion, word play, humorous insults, and the elaboration and reconstruction of metaphorical idioms are used for a variety of purposes, including reinforcement of group boundaries, re-constitution of the group's assigned task, and joint development of a complex set of ideas about group members' identities as scientists working in a publicly-funded lab. Throughout this conversation the social structuring and relational functions of playfulness and metaphor interacts with the accomplishment of the purposes of the conversation. We argue that analysis of language play, humor, and metaphor is strengthened by attention to the purpose of the talk and, conversely, understanding how the purpose of talk is accomplished is strengthened by attention to the participants' use of playful, metaphorical, and humorous language.",,,,,,,"U.S. Department of Energy, USDOE

Besides similarities, the study revealed significant differences in the conventional use of some complex metaphors, which indicate emphasis given to chosen parts of the target when talking about it, rather than proving the existence or nonexistence of the respective metaphor. Thus, by talking about the target, there is significant evidence for the ""CONQUEST,"" ""EATING/APPETIZING FOOD,"" and the ""GROWTH/ORGANISM/PLANT"" metaphors in the Brazilian corpus. By contrast, in the German interviews, the ""ECONOMICAL EXCHANGE,"" ""FUNCTIONING MACHINE,"" and ""JOURNEY"" metaphors are frequently employed.

Ninety children aged 11 (30 attending a music school and 30 Serbian and 30 Romani children with no musical education) were played 5 stimuli with mutually opposed musical elements and asked to respond what the first and what the second one was like. Their answers were classified into metaphors according to the tenets of the conceptual metaphor theory. The results suggest an overwhelming dominance of metaphorical replies, in which most mappings were based on image schemas within a predominantly visual-spatial modality. There were some differences in conceptualizations, however, with ""high and low"" tones also perceived as ""big and small,"" or ""upward"" musical motion seen as ""forward."" This article analyzes the possibility of finding a common denominator for seemingly disparate replies, where the study of musical conceptualization might be instrumental in the cognitive semantic quest for metaphorical universals. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Adlington, R., Moving beyond motion: Metaphors for changing sound (2003) Journal of The Royal Musical Association, 128 (2), pp. 297-318; Aksnes, H., (1998) Meaning Generation In Musical Listening, , http://philosophy.uoregon.edu/metaphor/aksnes.htm, Retrieved September 28, 2008, from, the Online Metaphor Center; Aksnes, H., Music and its resonating body (2002) Danish Yearbook For Music Research, 29, pp. 81-101; Ashley, R., Musical pitch space across modalities: Spatial and other mappings through language and culture (2004) Proceedings of The 8th International Conference On Music Perception and Cognition, , In S.

We argue that analogizing is not a single or even a fundamental cognitive process. The argument relies on an analysis of the history of the concept of analogy, case studies on the use of analogy in scientific problem solving, cognitive research on analogy comprehension and problem solving, and a survey of computational mechanisms of analogy comprehension. Analogizing is regarded as a macrocognitive phenomenon having a number of supporting processes. These include the apperception of resemblances and distinctions, metaphor, and the balancing of semantic flexibility and inference constraint. Psychological theories and computational models have generally relied on (a) a sparse set of ontological concepts (a property called ""similarity"" and a structuralist categorization of types of semantic relations), (b) a single form category (i.e., the classic four-term analogy), and (c) a single set of morphological distinctions (e.g., verbal vs. pictorial analogies). This article presents a classification based on a ""naturalistic"" exploration of the variety of uses of analogical reasoning in pragmatically distinct contexts. The resultant taxonomy distinguishes pre-hoc, ad-hoc, post-hoc, pro-hoc, contra-hoc, and trans-hoc analogy. Each will require its own macrocognitive modeling, and each presents an opportunity for research on phenomena of reasoning that have been neglected. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Ace, M.C., Dawis, R.V., Item structure as a determinant of item difficulty in verbal analogies (1973) Educational and Psychological Measurement, 33, pp. 143-149; Alvarez, L.W., Alvarez, W., Asaro, R., Michel, H.V., Extraterrestrial cause for the Cretaceous-Tertiary extinction (1980) Science, 208, pp. 1095-1108; Bacon, F., The new organon (1620) Francis Bacon: Baron of Verulam, Viscount St. Albans, , In F.

It offers an account of the formal ingredients of SOA, which fall into two groups: object-constitutive factors (like size, shape, and color) and object-depictment factors (like perspective, orientation, and distance from viewing point). Both factors allow us to treat SOA as a visual rhetorical scheme. We also discuss how SOA relates to conceptual structure, metaphoric or otherwise. Four types of relations are distinguished, based on the way in which perceptual and conceptual characteristics interact. Finally, we discuss the way in which these characteristics relate to the processing of such visual messages. One depictment factor will be focused on in particular: one-to-one versus one-to-many alignments. An attempt is made to connect these 2 patterns to the much-discussed topic in verbal metaphor theory, object comparison versus categorization. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Arnheim, R., (1970) Visual Thinking, , London: Faber & Faber; Biederman, I., Recognition-by-components: A theory of human image understanding (1987) Psychological Review, 94, pp. 115-147; Bowdle, B.F., Gentner, D., The career of metaphor (2005) Psychological Review, 112 (1), pp. 193-215; Desmarais, G., Dixon, M.J., Roy, E.A., A role for action knowledge in visual object identification (2007) Memory & Cognition, 35 (7), pp. 1712-1723; Forceville, C., (1996) Pictorial Metaphor In Advertising, , London: Routledge; Gibbs, R.W., Categorization and metaphor understanding (1992) Psychological Review, 99, pp. 572-577; Giora, R., Heruti, V., Metuki, N., Fein, O., ""When we say no we mean no"": Interpreting negation in vision and language Journal of Pragmatics, 41. , (in press); Glucksberg, S., The psycholinguistics of metaphor (2003) Trends In Cognitive Sciences, 7 (2), pp. 92-96; Glucksberg, S., Haught, C., On the relation between metaphor and simile: When comparison fails (2006) Mind & Language, 21, pp. 360-378; Glucksberg, S., Keysar, B., Understanding metaphorical comparisons: Beyond similarity (1990) Psychological Review, 97, pp. 3-18; (1992) Traité Du Signe Visuel.

Moreover, there was evidence that male participants found these disparaging metaphors to be more humorous than did female participants. To further test this finding, in Study 1 we administered the Bem Sex-Role Inventory-Revised and used the methodology from the Mio and Graesser study. We found that sex-typed men found the disparaging metaphors to be the most humorous, sex-typed women found the disparaging metaphors to be the least humorous, and androgynous men and women fell in between the sex-typed groups.

Results show that about half of the source domains overlap in the two languages and that both languages use domains that are employed for other games and sports as well. At the same time, less explored source domains also emerge. Motivation for the findings is discussed in terms of the possible effects of culture, subculture, embodiment, and language. The theoretical implications of the study include an argument for the benefits of a data-based source domain analysis at the expense of focusing on conceptual metaphors. Moreover, the data suggest that an empirical investigation of metaphorical expressions may challenge the notion of universal conceptual metaphors that build on the narrow, bodily experience sense of embodiment.",,,,,,,,,,"Bańczerowski, J., Some issues of the conceptualization of positive emotions (2005) Magyar Nyelvör, 129 (1), pp. 71-77; Boers, F., Demecheleer, M., A few metaphorical models in (Western) economic discourse (1997) Discourse and Perspectives in Cognitive Linguistics, pp. 115-129. , John Benjamins, Amsterdam; Cameron, L., Identifying and describing metaphor in spoken discourse data (1999) Researching and Applying Metaphor, pp. 105-132. , Cambridge University Press, Cambridge; Charteris-Black, J., Mussolff, A., 'Battered hero' or 'innocent victim'?

For most researchers, an idiom is transparent to the degree that a link can be found between its form and meaning. Cognitive linguists agree with the aforementioned view, but claim there is an additional source of transparency intuitions. They claim that transparency is partly the degree to which features inherent in an idiom (e.g., conceptual metaphors that are considered to underlie it) are seen as contributing to the idiom's meaning even before someone learns it. This article reports the results of an experiment which examines whether the cognitive linguistic claim about a hybrid source of idiom transparency intuitions is correct. Advanced second language learners of English guessed at the meaning of unknown idioms presented in or out of context. The results are congruent only with the hybrid view of idiom transparency. They indicate that idiom-inherent features contribute to the formation of transparency intuitions. In particular, although the idioms were unknown to participants, (1) high-transparency idioms received a significantly smaller number of interpretation types (not tokens) than low-transparency idioms in both context conditions, and (2) a significantly higher-than-chance number of correct idiom interpretations was given to high- rather than low- transparency idioms. However, the definition of transparency as the extent to which the meaning of an idiom can be guessed correctly, which is supported by some cognitive linguists, is not supported here: (a) the level of association between transparency and correct interpretations was low, and (b) when context was provided, the difference in the number of correct definitions between high- and low-transparency idioms was not significant.",,,,,,,"Cambridge Commonwealth, European and International Trust

What determines the form of figurative statement people prefer to use? To answer these questions we contrast the predictions of class-inclusion theory and the structure mapping theory and its career of metaphor variant with respect to aptness, conventionality, and working memory (WM) in a figurative statement production task. Consistent with both theories we found that property-aptness influences the time required to generate a vehicle, that conventionality predicts the quality of vehicles and the time it takes to generate them, and that WM capacity predicts the quality of vehicles produced. However, it was class-inclusion theory that best explained why we observed no effect of aptness on vehicle quality and why WM and vehicle quality, but not conventionality, influenced the likelihood of using the metaphor or simile form. We end with a discussion of how these results relate to Kintsch's Predication Model of comprehension and how the model may be extended to account for behavior in figurative statement production.",,,,,,,,,,"Baayen, R.H., Davidson, D.J., Bates, D.M., Mixed-effects modeling with crossed random effects (2008) Journal of Memory and Language, 59 (4), pp. 390-412; Baddeley, A., (1986) Working Memory, , Oxford University Press, New York; Bates, D., (2007) Lme4: Linear Mixed-effects Models Using S4 Classes, , R package version 0.99875-7; Blasko, D., Only the tip of the iceberg: Who understands what about metaphor?

This paradox can be resolved by attending to one crucial aspect of metaphor in communication: the question whether metaphor is used as deliberately metaphorical or not. It is likely that most deliberate metaphor is processed metaphorically (by comparison), as opposed to most nondeliberate metaphor, which may be assumed to be typically not processed metaphorically (that is, by categorization). This resolves the paradox of metaphor because it suggests that all ""metaphor in communication"" (all deliberate metaphor) is processed metaphorically.

From analysis of these different examples, it is concluded that simulation may come into play at different levels, depending on the metaphor and the context in which it is used. Further, it is suggested that the imaginative simulation of the object or action named by a metaphor vehicle, proposed by Gibbs, incorporates a partial subset of detail-level perceptual simulators. This leads to the proposal that the two models describe cognitive processes that operate at different levels or stages in the metaphor interpretation process, and that they might usefully be merged into a single more comprehensive model of embodied metaphor interpretation. The more comprehensive model provides a richer theoretical context for understanding how reuse and modification of a particular metaphor (Cameron, 2007) as well as the use of apparently different metaphors that activate similar simulations can influence comprehension, and how skilled orators can use these effects to accomplish complex communicative objectives (e.g., Blair, 2005; Obst, 2003).",,,,,,,,,,"Barr, D.J., Keysar, B., Making sense of how we make sense: The paradox of egocentrism in language use (2005) Figurative Language Comprehension: Social and Cultural Influences, pp. 21-42. , Lawrence Erlbaum, Mahwah, NJ; Barsalou, L., Perceptual symbol systems (1999) Behavioral and Brain Sciences, 22, pp. 577-609; Barsalou, L.W., Grounded cognition (2007) Annual Review of Psychology, 59, pp. 617-645; Barsalou, L.W., Santos, A., Simmons, W.K., Wilson, C.D., Language and simulation in conceptual processing (2007) Symbols, Embodiment, and Meaning, , [To appear in].

In the first three studies output from semantic memory indicates that undergraduate samples, when primed to think in ""LIFE"" in terms of a course followed until one's 70th year, provided a set of events output in a sequential order and when compared to a second sample, showed high agreement on the ages in which the events would occur. These data were taken as supportive of a ""JOURNEY"" metaphor in which one progressed along a life path. Study 2 indicated that the ""LIFE"" events produced also aroused specific subthemes, consistent with the notion of the arousal of lower-level ""LIFE-JOURNEY"" metaphors (e.g., ""LOVE IS A JOURNEY""). In a third study, we experimentally constrained the order of report from semantic memory. These data indicate that free output of events (as in Study 1) involves both a forward-temporal output, and clustering of life themes, but that forcing a forward-temporal order is indicative of the arousal of the superordinate conceptual metaphor but not the lower-level themes. Finally, in an episodic memory task one finds the reverse, namely arousal of the lower-level themes but not of the superordinate conceptual metaphor. Taken together, these findings indicate conditions under which the ""LIFE IS A JOURNEY"" metaphor is facilitated, and when lower-level metaphors are made more salient. In a more general way, the studies provide a new tool with which to study conceptual metaphors.",,,,,,,"06P007040","This work was supported by the Natural Science and Engineering Council of Canada (NSERC), grant 06P007040 to the second author.

On the basis of the interactionist conception of created metaphor, Rembrandt's production of an artistic genre of pictorial metaphor of self is described. Through a consistent compositional and content unification of the expressive portrait mouth with diverse types of costumes, he created an organic artistic model of meaningful and beautiful self-portraiture. Rembrandt's self as presented metaphorically represents the universe of art and artist. Because this compositional pictorial metaphor of self feature has not previously been recognized, a controlled empirical study was done indicating the significant characteristic association with Rembrandt's oeuvre. Creation of this metaphor is postulated as resulting from his use of the cognitive creative homospatial process - actively conceiving two or more discrete entities occupying the same mentally represented space, a conception leading to the articulation of new identities.",,,,,,,,,,"Alberti, L.B., (1956) On Painting, , Yale University Press, New Haven, CT; Albers, J., (1963) Interaction of Color, , Yale University Press, New Haven, CT; Aldrich, V.C., Visual metaphor (1968) Journal of Aesthetic Education, 2, pp. 73-86; Ainsworth, M.W., (1982) Art and Autoradiography: Insights Into the Genesis of Paintings By Rembrandt, Van Dyck, and Vermeer, , Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York; Black, M., (1962) Models and Metaphors, , Cornell University Press, Ithaca, NY; Black, M., More about metaphor (1979) Metaphor and Thought, pp. 9-43. , Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK; Brannigan, C.R., Humphries, D.A., Human nonverbal behavior, a means of communication (1972) Ethological Studies of Child Behavior, pp. 37-64. , Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK; Carroll, J.M., Russell, J.A., Do facial expressions signal specific emotions?

The corpus study reveals that the prevalent source domain in conventional metaphors for emotion is ""A HUGE MASS OF MOVING WATER IN THE NATURAL WORLD,"" and the specific emotions close to the emotion prototype are ANXIETY, RELIEF, DESIRE, and PLEASURE.

Results show both cross-linguistic similarities and differences. In both languages, children can understand metaphors embedded in stories by age 4, and provide verbal explanations for isolated instances of metaphors by age 5. Moreover, in both languages, changes in children's metaphorical ability are indexed by changes in their gestures. By age 4, children treat metaphorical concepts as physical objects and produce gestures that convey physical motion; whereas, by age 5, children begin to convey metaphorical meaning by producing gestures in spaces aligned with the target domain of the metaphor. Children also differ in their expression of metaphorical motion in the two languages; children learning English convey manner of motion more extensively than children learning Turkish. The findings underscore metaphor as an early emerging cognitive and linguistic ability, and provide further evidence for the embodied nature of conceptual metaphors.",,,,,,,"University of California Berkeley, UC Berkeley","The research presented in this paper was supported by a Chancellor’s Dissertation Grant and a Mellon Grant from the University of California, Berkeley to the author.

The results from 2 self-paced reading experiments supported this hypothesis. Low-span participants always read sentences with metaphoric anaphors slower than sentences with literal anaphors. In contrast, high-span participants did not take longer to read sentences with metaphoric anaphors than those with literal anaphors when the preceding context activated enough information to facilitate reference resolution. However, when the context activated so much information that the metaphor's function was obviated, high-span readers suffered and again read sentences with metaphoric anaphors more slowly than sentences with literal anaphors. These results show that, as with other types of anaphors, processing metaphoric anaphors is affected by working memory performance, and that the balance between processing cost and discourse function varies with working memory ability.",,,,,,,,"This work was partially supported by a grant from the University of South Carolina Research and Productive Scholarship Fund.",,"Almor, A., Noun-phrase anaphora and focus: The informational load hypothesis (1999) Psychological Review, 106 (4), pp. 748-765; Almor, A., Constraints and mechanisms in theories anaphor processing (2000) Architectures and Mechanisms for Language Processing, pp. 341-354. , Cambridge University Press., New York; Almor, A., A computational investigation of reference in production and comprehension (2004) Approaches to Studying World-situated Language Use: Bridging the Language-as-product and Language-as-action Traditions, pp. 285-301. , MIT Press., Cambridge, MA; Ariel, M., (1990) Accessing Noun-phrase Antecedents, , Routledge., London; New York; Boroditsky, L., Ramscar, M., The roles of body and mind in abstract thought (2002) Psychological Science, 13, pp. 185-189; Budiu, R., Anderson, J.R., Comprehending Anaphoric Metaphors (2002) Memory and Cognition, 30, pp. 158-165; Clark, H.H., Lucy, P., Understanding what is meant from what is said: A study in conversationally conveyed requests (1975) Journal of Verbal Learning & Verbal Behavior, 14 (1), pp. 56-72; Colston, H.L., Katz, A.N., (2003) Figurative Language Comprehension: Social and Cultural Influences, , Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Inc., Mahwah, NJ; Daneman, M., Carpenter, P.A., Individual differences in integrating information between and within sentences (1983) Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition, 9 (4), pp. 561-584; Estevez, A., Calvo, M.G., Working memory capacity and time course of predictive inferences (2000) Memory, 8 (1), pp. 51-61; Francis, W.N., Kucera, H., Mackie, A.W., (1982) Frequency Analysis of English Usage: Lexicon and Grammar, , Houghton Mifflin., Boston; Gibbs, R.W., Comprehending figurative referential descriptions (1990) Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, & Cognition, 16 (1), pp. 56-66; Gibbs, R.W., Tendahl, M., Cognitive effort and effects in metaphor comprehension: Relevance theory and psycholinguistics (2006) Mind & Language, 21 (3), pp. 379-403; Gildea, P., Glucksberg, S., On understanding metaphor: The role of context (1983) Journal of Verbal Learning & Verbal Behavior, 22 (5), pp. 577-590; Glucksberg, S., Keysar, B., Understanding metaphorical comparisons: Beyond similarity (1990) Psychological Review, 97 (1), pp. 3-18; Gordon, P.C., Grosz, B.J., Gilliom, L.A., Pronouns, names, and the centering of attention in discourse (1993) Cognitive Science, 17 (3), pp. 311-348; Gordon, P.C., Hendrick, R., The representation and processing of coreference in discourse (1998) Cognitive Science, 22 (4), pp. 389-424; Grice, H.P., Logic and Conversation (1975) Syntax and Semantics III: Speech Acts, pp. 41-58. , Academic Press., New York; Gundel, J., Hedberg, N., Zacharski, R., Cognitive status and the form of referring expressions in discourse (1993) Language & Cognitive Processes, 69, pp. 274-307; Hoffman, R.R., Honeck, R.P., A peacock looks at its legs: Cognitive science and figurative language (1980) Cognition and Figurative Language, pp. 3-24. , Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Inc., Hillsdale, NJ; Kazmerski, V.A., Blasko, D.G., Dessalegn, B.G., ERP and behavioral evidence of individual differences in metaphor comprehension (2003) Memory & Cognition, 31 (5), pp. 673-689; Kintsch, W., van Dijk, T.A., Toward a model of text comprehension and production (1978) Psychological Review, 85, pp. 363-394; Lemaire, B., Bianco, M., Contextual effects on metaphor comprehension: Experiment and simulation (2003); Linderholm, T., Predictive Inference Generation as a Function of Working Memory Capacity and Causal Text Constraints (2002) Discourse Processes, 34 (3), pp. 259-280; Link, K., Kreuz, R., Do men and women differ in their use of nonliteral language when they talk about emotions?

To test this view, we looked into interpretations of salience-based (here, literal) interpretations and expectation-based (here, ironic) interpretations in contexts inducing an expectation for irony. In Experiment 1, expectancy was manipulated by introducing an ironic speaker in vivo who also uttered the target utterance. Findings show that ironic targets were slower to read than literal counterparts. Experiment 2 shows that ironies took longer to read than literals and that response times to ironically related probes were longer than to literally related probes, regardless of context. Experiments 3 and 4 show that, even when participants were given extra processing time and were exclusively presented ironically biasing contexts, the expectancy for irony acquired throughout such exposure did not facilitate expectancy-based compared to salience-based interpretations.",,,,,,,"Tel Aviv University, TAU","The studies reported here were supported by a grant to the first author by Adams Super Center for Brain Tel Aviv University, and by Tel Aviv University Basic Research Fund.

In fact, the very theory of natural selection is couched in a system of metaphors that exhibit striking consistency and coherence. I argue that the phenomenon for which Darwin tries to detect the basic mechanisms, that is, biological evolution, involves vast, indeterminate, and ambiguous observations that are difficult to subject to the empirical methods. This fact motivates Darwin's extensive use of metaphors to organize his observations, structure the vague concepts, and ultimately render his observations meaningful and intelligible. I demonstrate that Darwin's metaphors, as far as they are elements of Idealized Cognitive Models, prove valuable in achieving this goal. First, I identify the conceptual metaphors underlying the main metaphorical expressions and show how these conceptual metaphors give rise to entailments and inferences central to Darwin's theory. The conceptual metaphors I identify are ""NATURE IS A MOTHER,"" ""NATURE IS A BREEDER,"" ""LIFE IS WAR,"" ""LIFE IS A RACE,"" and ""EVOLUTION IS PROGRESS."" I also comment briefly on the conceptual blending involved in these metaphorical mappings. I then turn to characterizing the idealized cognitive models (ICMs) that function as the pre-conceptual ground in virtue of which Darwin's metaphors are meaningful, coherent, and helpful to scientific thinking.

Despite extensive discussion of this metaphor by critics and supporters of Lakoff and Johnson, it has so far escaped serious scrutiny on several key points. English-speakers can identify verbal exchanges as arguments without resort to metaphorical comparisons or transfers, and speakers' use of war metaphors to characterize verbal dispute depends on conventional understandings rather than personal experience of war or of other kinds of physical struggle. Much of the evidence for Lakoff and Johnson's claims - a culture that metaphorizes argument as dance; the historical and personal priority of force over verbal dispute; the influence of metaphor on action; even the experience supposedly shaping source domains - depends on supposition and ungrounded assertion. In making sense of how people use this metaphor, the discourse-based program elaborated by Naomi Quinn (1991, 1997) carries analysis further than a purely conceptualist approach.",,,,,,,,,,"Alvarez, T., Blasco, J., Bugel, J., Gálvez, J.A., Ramírez, O., Rodger, L., (2004) Larousse Gran Diccionario: Inglés-español, Español-inglés, , Ediciones Larousse, Mexico, D.F; Arderey, R., (1961) African Genesis; A Personal Investigation Into the Animal Origins and Nature of Man, , Atheneum, New York; Black, M., (1962) Models and Metaphors, , Cornell University Press, Ithaca, NY; Cacciari, C., Why do we speak metaphorically?

It was hypothesized that decomposable and nondecomposable idiomatic expressions are represented differently in memory and that this difference affects the processing time of idiomatic expressions. In 2 experiments, participants read sentences containing decomposable idioms, nondecomposable idioms, or control expressions and performed a lexical decision task on figurative targets presented 0 msec, 350 msec, or 500 msec after reading. Results demonstrated a clear effect of compositionality on the activation of figurative meaning: decomposable idiomatic expressions were processed sooner than nondecomposable idiomatic ones. These results are discussed in the framework of the hybrid model (Titone & Connine, 1999) and the construction-integration (CI) model (Kintsch, 1998).",,,,,,,,,,"Bobrow, S.A., Bell, S.M., On catching on to idiomatic expressions (1973) Memory and Cognition, 1, pp. 343-346; Cacciari, C., Tabossi, P., The comprehension of idioms (1988) Journal of Memory and Language, 27, pp. 668-683; Caillies, S., ; Caillies, S., Le Sourn-Bissaoui, S., Idiom comprehension inFrench children: A cock-and-bull story (2006) European Journal of Developmental Psychology, 3 (2), pp. 189-206; Cutting, J.C., Bock, K., That's the way the cookie bounces: Syntactic and semantic components of experimentally elicited idiom blends (1997) Memory and Cognition, 25, pp. 57-71; Gibbs, R.W., Spilling the beans on understanding and memory for idioms in conversation (1980) Memory and Cognition, 8, pp. 149-156; Gibbs, R.W., Linguistic factors in children's understanding of idioms (1987) Journal of Child Language, 14, pp. 569-586; Gibbs, R.W., Semantic analyzability in children's understanding of idioms (1991) Journal of Speech and Hearing Research, 34, pp. 613-620; Gibbs, R.W., What do idioms really mean?

Speaking is breathing, and hence words are breath. Words are formed in the chest, specifically the animus. In speaking they are ""ejected"" or ""emitted"" from the animus. Speech is either ""breathed"" or ""poured"" into an audience, or else listeners ""grasp"" or ""catch"" what is said. Increasing familiarity with writing seems to have suggested that words might have an existence independent of human beings but, for most purposes, the Roman model has only two parts: speaker and hearer. An analysis of Cicero's private correspondence suggests that this model was the dominant way the Romans had for describing communication - easily dwarfing the use of either classical rhetoric or other ancient metaphors for speech based on spinning.",,,,,,,,,,"Grady, J., The ""Conduit Metaphor"" revisited: A reassessment of metaphors for communication (1998) Discourse and Cognition: Bridging the Gap, pp. 205-218. , CSLI, Sanford, CA; Lakoff, G., (1980) Metaphors We Live By, , University of Chicago Press, Chicago; Reddy, M., The Conduit metaphor (1979) Metaphor and Thought, pp. 164-201. , Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK; Wiseman, R., (2003) The Development of Ideas About Communication in European Thought From Ancient Greece to the Early Modern Age; (1952) The Loeb Classical Library, , Cicero, Brutus and Orator William Heinemann, London; (1948) The Loeb Classical Library, , Cicero.

We present the ""metaphor identification procedure"" (MIP), followed by an example of how the procedure can be applied to identifying metaphorically used words in 1 text. We then suggest a format for reporting the results of MIP, and present the data from our case study describing the empirical reliability of the procedure, discuss several complications associated with using the procedure in practice, and then briefly compare MIP to other proposals on metaphor identification. The final section of the paper suggests ways that MIP may be employed in disciplinary and interdisciplinary studies of metaphor.",,,,,,,"Emory University

Taking a key Buddhist concept, EMPTINESS, to mean transcending the self, Buddhism may be misunderstood as promoting a view of the human mind as disembodied. Micro-level linguistic analysis, however, reveals a paradox between the central message of non-attachment to the body or to the sensations and the pervasiveness of lexical metaphors in the text involving sensori-motor experiences. Investigations of the overarching metaphors and oxymora at the macro-level, such as ""FORM IS EMPTY"" and ""EMPTINESS IS FORM"" suggest that Buddhism in fact bears some striking similarities to cognitive philosophy in its recognition of embodiment and categorization as key aspects of mind, whose figurative nature becomes comprehensible through EMPTINESS as a reflection of the dependent nature of all phenomena.",,,,,,,,,,"Charteris-Black, J., (2004) Corpus Approaches to Critical Metaphor Analysis, , Macmillan, New York; Chao, S., (1995) Baihua Sinching (The Heart Sutra Explained), , Jiou-yi, Taipei, Taiwan; Chiang, W., Lu, L.W., (2007) Conceptualizing an Ideal Self in Mahayana Buddhism: Evidence from the Diamond Sutra; Cooper, W.E., Ross, J.R., World order (1975) Functionalism, pp. 63-111. , Chicago Linguistic Society., Chicago; Croft, W., Cruse, A., (2004) Cognitive Linguistics, , Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, England; Gibbs, R., (1994) The Poetics of Mind: Figurative Thought, Language and Understanding, , Cambridge University Press, New York; Gibbs, R., Lima, P., Francozo, E., Metaphor is grounded in embodied experience (2004) Journal of Pragmatics, 36, pp. 1189-1210; Grady, J., Foundations of meaning: Primary metaphors and primary scenes (1997), Unpublished Ph.D. dissertation, University of California, Berkeley; Jameson, F., (1975) The Prison-house of Language: A Critical Account of Structuralism and Russian Formalism, , Princeton University Press, Princeton, NJ; Johnson, M., (1987) The Body in the Mind- the Bodily Basis of Meaning, Imagination, and Reason, , Chicago University Press, Chicago; Johnson, M., Merleau-Ponty's embodied semantics - From imminent meaning, to gesture, to language (2006) EurAmerica, 36, pp. 1-27; Lakoff, G., Johnson, M., (1980) Metaphors We Live By, , Chicago University Press, Chicago; Lakoff, G., Johnson, M., (1999) Philosophy in the Flesh: The Embodied Mind and Its Challenge to Western Thought, , Basic Books, New York; Lopez, D.S., (1988) The Heart Sutra Explained, , State University of New York Press, New York; Lopez, D.S., (1996) Elaborations on Emptiness, , Princeton University Press, Princeton, NJ; Payne, R., Buddhism and cognitive science: Contributions to an enlarged discourse, symposium proceedings (2002) Pacific World, 4, pp. 1-14; Shi, S., (1997) Sin De Jingdian (The Sutra of Heart), , Dharma Drum, Taipei, Taiwan; Slingerland, E., Conceptual metaphor theory as methodology for comparative religion (2004) Journal of the American Academy of Religion, 72 (1), pp. 1-31; Varela, F.J., Thompson, E., Rosch, E., (1991) The Embodied Mind: Cognitive Science and Human Experience, , MIT Press, Cambridge; Massachusetts","Chiang, W.Y.; Graduate Institute of Linguistics, Graduate Institute of Linguistics, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan",,,,,,,,10926488,,,,"English","Metaphor Symbol",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-41449115000

In particular, we postulate that the conflicting results of previous studies (Nayak & Gibbs, 1990; Glucksberg et al., 1993) may be due to either one or both of the two diverse methods employed: (1) the different task demands (a judgment task employed by the former versus a reading task employed by the latter) and (2) the distinct visual presentations of stimuli (a paragraph presentation in the former versus the line-by-line presentation in the latter). We carried out one off-line and four on-line tasks in order to examine which factors affect the access of conceptual mappings in on-going discourse. Our study supports the hypothesis that conceptual mappings exist and are accessed in on-going language processing when materials are presented in a paragraph style. We argue that the line-by-line presentation method creates an expectation for new information, and thus, does not facilitate the activation of conceptual mappings, while a paragraph presentation method allows for conceptual representations to be built and accessed, regardless of what type of task is used.",,,,,,,"National Science Council, NSC: NSC93-2411-H-002-018-ME, NSC91-2411-H-002-082-ME, NSC92-2411-H-002-076-ME","This research was supported by grants from the National Science Council of Taiwan to the second author (NSC91-2411-H-002-082-ME, NSC92-2411-H-002-076-ME and NSC93-2411-H-002-018-ME).

This paper argues that interpretive diversity better explains a metaphor-simile distinction than these properties. Interpretive diversity refers to the semantic richness of the figurative interpretation of a topic-vehicle pair and is determined depending on both the number of features involved in the interpretation and the uniformity of salience distribution of those features. The interpretive diversity view predicts that interpretively more diverse pairs should be easier to comprehend via a categorization process, and thus the preference for and the relative comprehensibility of the metaphor form should be greater. Two experiments demonstrated that, as predicted, interpretive diversity was correlated positively with metaphor preference (Experiment 1) and with the relative comprehensibility of the metaphor form compared to the simile form (Experiment 2). Furthermore, interpretive diversity was found to be more important in explaining metaphor-simile distinction than aptness, similarity, and conventionality.",,,,,,,"Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, MEXT","This research was supported by Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research C (No. 17500171) and for Encouragement of Young Scientists (No.14780263), The Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan.

In the reported studies the cost of the favor was manipulated (in terms of effort, resources or time needed to perform the favor) and whether the gender of the person performing the favor was the same or opposite as that for whom the favor was done. Across the two studies, the non-literal acknowledgment was less likely to be employed for high-cost favors, was more likely to be recalled compared to other acknowledgments generated at the same base rate and was used differently by female and male participants. These data demonstrate that people moderate their thanks as a function of the cost of the favor and to whom they are speaking, results indicating that gratitude acknowledgments cannot be considered mere phatic communication.

In a sentence-priming experiment, we compared sentences featuring verbs in idiomatic phrases with control sentences in which the same verbs were meant literally. Participants made lexical decisions about nouns that were associated with either the verb's literal meaning, with the figurative meaning of the phrase, or were unassociated nouns. Verbs in sentence-final position were highly predictable in both types of sentences and hence the phrasal meaning was rendered as figurative or literal before the sentence-final word. Our results showed that in literal sentences, the activation of literal associations was much stronger than that of figurative associations, whereas in idiomatic sentences, associations with the literal meaning of the verb were activated to the same degree as were associations with the figurative meaning. This contrasts with previous psycholinguistic research suggesting that literal associations should not be activated as soon as the phrase has been recognized as idiom. We argue that the literal verb meaning is essential in both figurative and nonfigurative language and present a model of idiom recognition that integrates our findings.",,,,,,,"Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG

Past studies assert that the origin of Chinese language metaphors for thinking and feeling can be found in traditional Chinese medico-philosophical theory, where the heart is viewed as the seat of thought and emotion, and the brain, which constitutes the cognitive center in western theories of the self, is secondary. While most participants employed heart metaphors to express thinking and feeling, many of the participants also employed brain metaphors. Instead of suggesting that this multiplicity implies westernization, this paper argues that cultural understandings of the self can be multiple. To appreciate this, it is necessary to look at spontaneously generated speech in a narrative context. This paper thus analyzes three participant narratives, a process that carries several implications for studies approaching the relationship between metaphor, culture, and the self.",,,,,,,,"This study was funded by Fulbright Student Fellowship and Jacob K.
