Using the situational theory of problem solving (STOPS), the current study investigates employees’ cognitive reactions as well as how their communicative behaviors are affected by the pre-crisis EOR and organizations’ symmetrical communication effort in a crisis. An online survey was conducted with 410 full-time U.S. employees working in large corporations. Results indicated that a favorable pre-crisis relationship between an organization and its employees significantly affects how they perceive a crisis and their communicative behaviors. Employees’ perceived symmetrical communication strengthens the relationship between the pre-established relationship with employees and their crisis perceptions. Findings provide a comprehensive picture of the process by which the EOR directs employee behaviors in a crisis, as well as the positive effects of symmetrical internal communication. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed. © 2020, © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Adamu, A.A., Mohamad, B., Rahman, N.A.A., Antecedents of internal crisis communication and its consequences on employee performance (2016) International Review of Management and Marketing, 6 (7S), pp. 33-41; Banks, S.D., Multicultural public relations (1995) A sociointerpretive approach, , Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage,.

However, the connection between advocacy and virality received limited scholarly scrutiny. This study extends our knowledge of advocacy by examining the relationships between advocacy strategies, tactics, and virality. For this study, Facebook posts of LGBTQ advocacy organizations from January 2016 to December 2018 were collected. Content analysis of 1,500 Facebook posts revealed advocacy and relationship building strategies of LGBTQ nonprofit organizations. MANOVA analyses signaled that advocacy strategies and tactics are significant predictors for virality.

Employing key variables from the situational theory of problem solving and the technology acceptance model, this study proposes an emerging Situational Technology Acceptance Model (STAM). A nationwide survey of 994 American respondents in Spring 2016 and a two-step structural equation modeling process empirically supported STAM. By digging into the nuances of people’s situational motivations to solve a problem and their attitudes toward using a new technology, STAM found that the respondents’ donation intentions were more associated with their technological attitudes. Finally, this study uses awareness of mobile donation and mobile donation intention as two dimensions to segment mobile phone users to active, aware, latent, and non-publics, and offers practical advice for nonprofits to better target their fundraising efforts. © 2020, © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Aldoory, L., Sha, B.-L., The situational theory of publics: Practical applications, methodological challenges, and theorical horizons (2007) The future of excellence in public relations and communication management: Challenges for the next generation, pp. 339-355. , Toth E.L., (ed), Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum, &,.

A better understanding of the role of organizations in forming and monitoring such issue debates is necessary, given the influence of public affairs activities and media debates on politicians’ and public opinion. However, such a macro perspective is largely missing. This study analyzes the debate around the use of the pesticide glyphosate when the European Union decided on a license renewal in 2017. To uncover emerging salient topics and their relations with organizations, the online global coverage of the issue from the GDELT database (N = 1677) was analyzed using inductive automated content analysis (LDA topic modeling). Only three topics were salient in the arena, most prominently the carcinogenicity of glyphosate, thereby sidelining other relevant aspects. Furthermore, online issue arenas reach globally and are converged communicative spaces where a variety of media participate. Thus, the article develops and tests a typology of online news media for issue arena research.

These products have received criticism for co-opting LGBTQ symbols for commercial purposes. Using samples of heterosexual and LGBTQ participants, this study examines the impact of model gender expression (masculine, feminine) and non-profit contribution amount (1%, 100% of sales) on for-profit consumer responses (attitude toward the ad, brand, and purchase inten tion) to Pride collection advertisements. In contrast to previous literature about monetary contributions on behalf of companies, a lower contribution amount (1%) was consistently found to produce more positive consumer responses than an advertisement that touted a complete (100%) contribution to a related non-profit organization. Additionally, heterosexual participants exhibited more positive attitudes toward the brand and advertisement than did LGBTQ participants. Findings from this study also show that social responsibility campaigns, such as Pride collection advertisements, can have positive societal outcomes. In recent years, support has grown for the LGBTQ community in many countries. It is advantageous for global brands to consider if and how they might take a stand on this important social issue. © 2020, © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Abad-Santos, A., (2018) How LGBTQ pride month became a branded holiday: And why that’s a problem, , https://www.vox.com/2018/6/25/17476850/pride-month-lgbtq-corporate-explained, Vox.com; Abitbol, A., Sternadori, M., Championing women’s empowerment as a catalyst for purchase intentions: Testing the mediating roles of oprs and brand loyalty in the context of femvertising (2019) International Journal of Strategic Communication, 13 (1), pp. 22-41. , https://doi.org/10.1080/1553118X.2018.1552963; Åkestam, N., Rosengren, S., Dahlen, M., Think about it–Can portrayals of homosexuality in advertising prime consumer-perceived social connectedness and empathy?

Drawing on the dialogic communication framework, this study captures these aspects and analyzes data from a public organization in Taiwan, including the content and linguistic analyses of this organization’s Facebook messages over a year, along with interviews and survey with the organization. The data show that the messages aiming to mobilize publics offline and communicated through conversation-style, informal language, and affective and motion words, exemplify dialogic orientation. These messages are positively associated with public engagement on Facebook in terms of the number of likes, comments, and shares. Further, analysis of the interviews and the survey shows that the organization and the targeted publics have mutual and interdependent relationships developed through varied uses of Facebook. Such relationships also influence the perceived effectiveness of the organization’s message strategies intended to foster dialogic communication. Nonetheless, the lack of communication among units within the organization, as well as its bureaucratic culture, result in negative effects for certain message strategies. © 2020, © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Agostino, D., Arnaboldi, M., A measurement framework for assessing the contribution of social media to public engagement: An empirical analysis on Facebook (2016) Public Management Review, 18 (9), pp. 1289-1307. , https://doi.org/10.1080/14719037.2015.1100320; Ao, S.H., Huang, Q.S., A systematic review on the application of dialogue in public relations to information communication technology-based platforms: Comparing English and Chinese contexts (2019) Public Relations Review, , https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pubrev.2019.101814, 46, (1), 101814; Arguello, J., Butler, B.S., Joyce, E., Kraut, R., Ling, K.S., Rosé, C., Wang, X., Talk to me: Foundations for successful individual-group interactions in online communities (2006) Proceedings of the SIGCHI conference on human factors in computing systems, pp. 959-968. , https://doi.org/10.1145/1124772.1124916, April, ACM, &,.

Data were used from the 2007 (N = 1,087) and 2016 (N = 2,710) editions of the European Communication Monitor, an annual survey among strategic communication professionals in Europe. For the first time a basic two-level multilevel regression model was used to assess country effects and individual predictors (age, gender, education, position, and experience in the field) of media use (of mass media, owned media, social media, and interpersonal communication) and perceptions of the level of excellence of communication of the organization. Country and generational effects on the perception of strategic issues for the field were analysed using chi-square tests. Results show that in 2016, country effects are significant for the perception of the importance of mass media and social media use, interpersonal communication, and strategic issues for the field. In 2007, no such country effects were found. These results suggest that the influence and the context of the country of residence of the strategic communication professional have increased between 2007 and 2016. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

Scholars, however, have not thoroughly examined the reasons why organizations choose to adopt new social media platforms. And existing research uses a variety of theoretical perspectives. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to examine organizational adoption of new social media channels using the Information and Communication Technology approach within the context of strategic communication in order to advance theory building about social media adoption and to better understand the multiple influences on organizational adoption of these channels for strategic communication purposes. Snapchat was selected as the social media platform of interest because it is relatively new and experienced rapid adoption among users and organizations. Qualitative interviews with 23 social media managers and consultants found that social processes within organizations (i.e., norms, agendas, and culture) and Snapchat’s materiality (i.e., features, benefits, and constraints) influenced organizational decisions about adopting the platform. They also show that these social and technological influences are framed around strategic communication concepts. However, in terms of strategic communication, Snapchat adoption was purposeful, but it did not rise to the level of being a strategic decision. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"How to use Snapchat to promote your brand and drive ROI [Infographic] (2017) Social Media Today, , https://www.socialmediatoday.com/social-business/how-use-snapchat-promote-your-brand-and-drive-roi-infographic, August, 26, Retrieved from; Alikilic, O., Atabek, U., Social media adoption among Turkish public relations professionals: A survey of practitioners (2012) Public Relations Review, 38 (1), pp. 56-63; Avery, E., Lariscy, R., Amador, E., Ickowitz, T., Primm, C., Taylor, A., Diffusion of social media among public relations practitioners in health departments across various community population sizes (2010) Journal of Public Relations Research, 22 (3), pp. 336-358; Avery, E., Lariscy, R., Sweetser, K.D., Social media and shared—Or divergent—Uses?

Recognizing that strategic communication is a sub-discipline of communication science, we study how the field is anchored in the corpus of established communication theories–including social science, interpretative, and critical approaches. To describe the use, development, and context of communication theories in strategic communication publications, we analyzed all articles published in ten public relations/ corporate communication/ organizational communication/ strategic communication journals over twenty years (N = 4,027). While the vast majority of articles did not refer to one of the 91 communication theories, the share of references to these theories has been increasing. Overall, we found a high diversity of approaches–with considerable differences among journals–indicating a broad discourse. However, we also found a growing relevance of the social science paradigm. We argue that a stronger focus on communication theories may facilitate a consilient synthesis and increase the relevance of the field, academically and practically. We therefore propose to strengthen the communication science perspective in strategic communication. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

Responsibility is understood as a social construct that depends on who attributes it. This also means that people can have very different perceptions of the responsibility of corporations, all of which may not be covered by typical Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) communication. Moreover, corporate legitimacy can be at risk if these perspectives drift too far apart. This article presents a public survey (N = 1,003) that was conducted in Germany, as well as a content analysis of responsibility judgments (N = 498) communicated by selected German corporations. The multi-method study uses the example of the clothing and banking industries. Results show differences between the self- and public images, particularly when it comes to the prioritization of responsibility fields. The people surveyed emphasize legal responsibility objects much more than the analyzed corporations. In addition, the self-image communicated by the researched clothing manufacturers deviates more from their public image than the self-image communicated by the banks. The findings suggest that corporations, especially from the clothing industry, should take stronger evaluation, communication monitoring and stakeholder dialogues into account. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,"Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG",This work was supported by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft.

The present study focuses on PSYOP effects. The few studies available on this area indicate that the effects of PSYOP generally tend to be on a minor scale, while PSYOP may have a stronger impact in specific contexts. We discuss possible explanations and suggest that a number of psychological factors inhibit PSYOP success. One major example is that of human cognitive conservatism. Other psychological mechanisms, mostly emotional ones, may promote PSYOP, for example, strong identification with one’s own (national, ethnic or religious) group, a sense of threat to the resources, status and/or survival of own group, a perception of hostility from other groups, and the experience that another group has devalued or offended the in-group. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

To stimulate further debate and identify areas of agreement, we suggest that the strategic value of integrated corporate communication (ICC) is in recognizing the unique interests and objectives associated with different functions of corporate communication while at the same time considering the cross-functional synergy as a knowledge transformation mechanism. The Competing Values Framework (CVF) is articulated as a lens with which functions of corporate communication can be grouped and differentiated according to common principles and practices. The CVF is beneficial for assessing the potential gap between expectations of stakeholders and corporate communication responses and for developing focused strategies that strengthen the reputational assets of companies. We illustrate the strategic value of the integrated approach in providing a consequential view of corporate communication events and activities through Chipotle’s strategic responses to the E. coli outbreak in 2015–2017.

Artificial Intelligence (AI), Big Data, and the Internet of Things (IoT) create a rapidly changing environment for organizations as well as system complexities. To fulfill its task in ensuring the long-lasting success of organizations’ strategic communication needs to continuously adopt to this revolution. This article approaches the question of how strategic communication can adapt to the digitalization. In order to do so, the article conceptualizes the corporate nervous net and a predictive reporting indicator module with real-time feedback loops. As a result, the strategic communication body of knowledge is extended to include digital, assisted, decentralized communication. Decentralized strategic communication proposes a self-organizing, bottom-up approach of strategic communication under the principle of subsidiarity. It keeps complexity at a manageable level and enables the usage of local knowledge and quick adaptation to rapid changes. The proposed resilient approach to strategic communication uses the driving forces of the digital revolution of big data, AI and IoT in its favor instead of trying to control them. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Appelbaum, J., Gibson, A., Guarnieri, C., Müller-Maguhn, A., Poitras, L., Rosenbach, M., Sontheimer, M., (2015) The digital arms race - NSA Preps America for future battle, , http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/new-snowden-docs-indicate-scope-of-nsa-preparations-for-cyber-battle-a-1013409.html, January, 17, Retrieved from, …; Armbruster, D., Kaneko, K., Mikhailov, A.S., (2005) Networks of interacting machines: Production organization in complex industrial systems and biological cells, , Singapore: World Scientific; Arthur, C., (2013) Tech giants may be huge, but nothing matches big data, , https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/aug/23/tech-giants-data, August, 23, Retrieved from; Bell, S., Morse, S., Sustainability indicators past and present: What next?

The study explored online employee communication and interaction during 60 ideation sessions, including 2,420 suggested ideas, 6,558 comments, and 3,017 likes since the implementation in 2011 in a large, knowledge-intensive Danish organization. One ideation session counting 70 ideas, including 263 comments and 340 likes, was selected for an in-depth analysis of employee communication when generating ideas on internal social media. The study found that employees ideate mostly through three dialogue strategies: anticipating objections, asking directional questions, and opening up to other viewpoints. With these strategies, employees addressed uncertainty in mitigating interactions imagined to be face-threatening. Moreover, the present research suggests that uncertainty and dialogue strategies are considered resources for online employee ideation. Uncertainty may offer the opportunity for open, reflective, and stimulating dialogues, and the dialogue strategies may enhance online ideation. It is not until after an idea starts to develop through the multi-vocal dialogues that opportunities for innovation may emerge. In that sense, online employee communication about ideas is considered of strategic significance to one of the organization’s goals of being an innovation leader. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Alvesson, M., (2004) Knowledge work and knowledge-intensive firms, , New York, NY: Oxford University Press; Arundale, R.B., Constituting face in conversation: Face, facework, and interactional achievement (2010) Journal of Pragmatics, 42 (8), pp. 2078-2105; Aten, K., Thomas, G.F., Crowdsourcing strategizing: Communication technology affordances and the communicative constitution of organizational strategy (2016) International Journal of Business Communication, 53 (2), pp. 148-180; Bakhtin, M.M., (1984) Problems of Dostoevsky’s poetics, , Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press; Bakhtin, M.M., (1986) Speech genres and other late essays, , Austin: University of Texas Press; Baxter, L.A., Montgomery, B.M., (1996) Relating: dialogues and dialectics, , New York, NY: The Guilford Press; Beretta, M., Idea selection in web-enabled ideation systems (2019) Journal of Product Innovation Management, 36 (1), pp. 5-23; Beretta, M., Björk, J., Magnusson, M., Moderating ideation in web-enabled ideation systems (2018) Journal of Product Innovation Management, 35 (3), pp. 389-409; Bergendahl, M., Magnusson, M., Creating ideas for innovation: Effects of organizational distance on knowledge creation processes (2015) Creativity and Innovation Management, 24 (1), pp. 87-101; Bergendahl, M., Magnusson, M., Björk, J., Ideation high performances: A study of motivational factors (2015) Creativity Research Journal, 27 (4), pp. 361-368; Berger, C.R., Calabrese, R.J., Some explorations in initial interaction and beyond: Toward a developmental theory of interpersonal communication (1975) Human Communication Research, 1, pp. 99-112; Birkinshaw, J., Bouquet, C., Barsoux, J.L., The 5 myths of innovation (2011) MIT Sloan Management Review, 52 (2), pp. 43-50; Björk, J., Boccardelli, P., Magnusson, M., Ideation capabilities for continuous innovation (2010) Creativity and Innovation Management, 19 (4), pp. 385-396; Björk, J., Di Vincenzo, F., Magnusson, M., Mascia, D., The impact of social capital on ideation (2011) Industry and Innovation, 18 (6), pp. 631-647; Björk, J., Magnusson, M., Where do good innovation ideas come from?

By using the concepts of celebrity endorsement and authenticity, the effect of celebrity and content characteristics on followers’ attitudes towards the content and, in the case of sponsored content, purchase intentions are scrutinized. Instagram followers (N = 592) of 45 celebrities responded to a survey on nine photos of the celebrities. The results show that both the perceived authenticity and attractiveness of the celebrity are positively related with photo attitudes, but only authenticity has an effect on purchase intentions. Photos of social media influencers, people who have become famous through social media, increase purchase intentions more than photos of general celebrities. Congruence between the photo and the celebrity has the strongest positive effect on photo attitudes and purchase intentions. Sponsored photos are less favorably perceived than non-sponsored photos, but, among sponsored photos, sponsor disclosure has no effect on purchase intentions. The perceived authenticity of both the celebrity and her content is said to explain favorable audience perceptions. The findings imply that organizations should seek authentic matches between their message and the endorsing celebrity and that the content should align with the usual style of the celebrity. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Abidin, C., Communicative intimacies: Influencers and perceived interconnectedness (2015) Ada: A Journal of Gender, New Media, and Technology, 8. , https://adanewmedia.org/2015/11/issue8-abidin/; Abidin, C., Ots, M., Influencers tell all?

Yet, little is known about the impact an SMI’s personal indiscretion has on their endorsing organizations. This article examines the factors that trigger these crises and their effects on the organizational image. Five cases–PewDiePie (U.S.), Munroe Bergdorf (UK), James Charles (U.S.), Grace Mongey (Ireland) and Sarah Bowmar (U.S.)–were analyzed using Rapid Issue Tracking, a method to capture stakeholders’ sentiments. Findings showed that SMIs’ personal indiscretions trigger paracrises. Organizations typically used distancing strategies but adopted image repair situationally. Anchored on image repair theory, we propose a framework for crisis identification and response strategies. With the increasing use of SMIs in marketing, their potential as a new type of crisis trigger warrants attention. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Ahrens, J., Coyle, J.R., A content analysis of registration processes on websites: How advertisers gather information to customize marketing communications (2011) Journal of Interactive Advertising, 11 (2), pp. 12-26; Alaska, B., Sarah Silverman gets hired regularly by @Disney for dressing in blackface.

In this paper, we offer a first conceptualization of streamers as social media influencers, and how effectively they can perform strategic communication for sponsors. We draw on extensive ethnographic research and over a hundred semi-structured interviews with streamers to address two questions: first, how does Twitch operate as a platform for strategic communication; second, what skills do streamers need to be successful influencers? In the first case, we show Twitch is well suited to influencing, in large part due to its integration of data analytics, while streamers are using these tools to adopt a business-oriented mindset; in the second case, we show the importance of authenticity to both streamers and clients, and how channels of different sizes offer strategic communication opportunities. The article contributes to the emerging literature on Twitch, developing insights from influencing and strategic communication, but given the increasing scope of live streaming, we also argue the phenomenon–particularly when combined with the economic dynamics of influencing–is just as important for making sense of the wider media landscape today. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,"UK Research and Innovation, UKRI

We conducted a systematic literature review of 39 peer-reviewed articles published between 2011 and 2018. Using Lasswell’s transmission model of communication as an approach to systemize communication acts, we identified, systematized, and synthesized main findings from existing literature. The review reveals a rag rug of fragmented research questions, combined with a lack of theoretical integration and a widespread methodological monism. Moreover, questions related to the implications of influencer communication for strategic planning are understudied. Hence, more research is required to understand underlying cause-and-effect relations and managerial implementation of strategic influencer communication. In conclusion, we encourage researchers to investigate the concept of social media influencer communication from a strategic communication perspective, including applying multidisciplinary approaches and a broader range of empirical methods, which would foster a deeper understanding of strategic influencer communication. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Abidin, C., Visibility labour: Engaging with Influencers’ fashion brands and #OOTD advertorial campaigns on Instagram (2016) Media International Australia, 161 (1), pp. 86-100; Abidin, C., Thompson, E.C., Buymylife.com: Cyber-femininities and commercial intimacy in blogshops (2012) Women’s Studies International Forum, 35 (6), pp. 467-477; Amos, C., Holmes, G., Strutton, D., Exploring the relationship between celebrity endorser effects and advertising effectiveness (2008) International Journal of Advertising, 27 (2), pp. 209-234; Araujo, T., Neijens, P., Vliegenthart, R., Getting the word out on Twitter: The role of influentials, information brokers and strong ties in building word-of-mouth for brands (2017) International Journal of Advertising, 36 (3), pp. 496-513; Archer, C., Harrigan, P., Show me the money: How bloggers as stakeholders are challenging theories of relationship building in public relations (2016) Media International Australia, 160 (1), pp. 67-77; Bakker, D., Conceptualising influencer marketing (2018) Journal of Emerging Trends in Marketing and Management, 1 (1), pp. 79-87; Bakshy, E., Hofman, J.M., Mason, W.A., Watts, D.J., Everyone’s an influencer: Quantifying influence on twitter (2011) Proceedings of the fourth ACM international conference on Web search and data mining - WSDM ‘11, pp. 65-74. , King I., Nejdl W., Li H., (eds), January, New York, NY: ACM Press, &,.

This study explores how positive and negative priming of sponsored content shapes the authenticity perception of the vlogger among its audience members. Four different manipulation conditions were constructed to study a U.S. based travel vlog on Qualtrics, with data collected via Amazon’s Mechanical Turk. A theory-guided content analysis of 211 open viewer responses was conducted to compare perceptions of authenticity between the manipulation groups. The results verified the significance of priming: the same sponsored content can result in opposite reactions among the audience members depending on the positive/negative valence of the introductory text attached, highlighting the central importance of strategic communication related to the perception of sponsored content. The results also point out the importance of audience member engagement for experienced authenticity: The manipulation of audience participation with the vlog had a stronger effect on the perception of authenticity of the vlogger than the positive/negative valence of the introductory text. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

However, despite the growing relevance of this new strategic communication instrument, research has paid only limited attention to elaborating its basic concepts. In this article, we adopt a strategic communication perspective to develop a conceptual framework for strategic social media influencer communication. Particularly, we draw on research findings that identify the external resources social media influencers contribute to organization-influencer cooperation. We use these findings to systematically develop functional definitions of social media influencers and of strategic social media influencer communication. We define social media influencers as third-party actors who have established a significant number of relevant relationships with a specific quality to and influence on organizational stakeholders through content production, content distribution, interaction, and personal appearance on the social web. Subsequently, we define strategic social media communication as the purposeful use of communication by organizations or social media influencers in which social media influencers are addressed or perform activities with strategic significance to organizational goals. We then situate these definitions within the broader framework of strategic communication by discussing related concepts and by describing the strategic action field that has emerged around strategic social media influencer communication. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Abidin, C., #In$tagLam: Instagram as a repository of taste, a brimming marketplace, a war of eyeballs (2014) Mobile media making in an age of smartphones, pp. 119-128. , Berry M., Schleser M., (eds), New York, NY: Palgrave Pivot,.

Survey results provide empirical support for the application of the STOPS in a CSR communication context and suggest that a collectivistic orientation predicts individuals’ situational perceptions and cognitive reactions toward organizations’ environmental CSR efforts. Theoretical and practical implications for strategic communicators are discussed. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Ajzen, I., (1988) Attitudes, personality, and behavior, , Homewood, IL: Dorsey Press; Aldoory, L., Sha, B.L., The situational theory of publics: Practical applications, methodological challenges, and theoretical horizons (2007) The future of excellence in public relations and communication management: Challenges for the next generation, , Tosh E.L., (ed), Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, &,.

In this institutional discourse about moral responsibilities, corporate actors aim at defending the legitimacy of digital platforms. This study conceptualizes strategic communication as a means for conveying conformity to legitimacy expectations, to shape legitimacy judgments, and to discursively conduct institutional work. A critical discourse analysis of Zuckerberg’s testimony before the European Parliament finds that pragmatic, moral, and cognitive legitimacy is signaled through corporate ability, responsibility, and conformity narratives, respectively. Moreover, Zuckerberg’s techno-libertarian talk advocates Silicon Valley ideology through utility narratives of artificial intelligence. Thus, Zuckerberg conducts institutional work as an institutional entrepreneur whose strategic communication seeks to manipulate views as well as institutions. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Alvesson, M., Hallett, T., Spicer, A., Uninhibited Institutionalisms (2019) Journal of Management Inquiry, 51. , 105649261882277; Ashforth, B.E., Gibbs, B.W., The double-edge of organizational legitimation (1990) Organization Science, 1 (2), pp. 177-194; Bannister, F., Connolly, R., The fourth power: ICT and the role of the administrative state in protecting democracy (2018) Information Polity, 23 (3), pp. 307-323; Beattie, V., Dhanani, A., Jones, M.J., Investigating presentational change in U.K. annual reports: A longitudinal perspective (2008) Journal of Business Communication, 45 (2), pp. 181-222; Bitektine, A., Haack, P., The “Macro” and the “Micro” of legitimacy: Toward a multilevel theory of the legitimacy process (2015) Academy of Management Review, 40 (1), pp. 49-75; Campbell, J.L., Why would corporations behave in socially responsible ways?

The objective of this study is to examine the influence of social media usage, leadership, crisis responsibility, and error management culture on internal crisis communication. In addition, this study investigates how internal crisis communication impacts affective organizational commitment and perceived organizational support. A survey was conducted of 325 employees of an electricity distribution company. Findings indicate that leadership and error management culture are significantly related to internal crisis communication. In contrast, social media usage and crisis responsibility do not have a significant effect on internal crisis communication. However, internal crisis communication is positively related to affective organizational commitment and perceived organizational support. The results of this study suggest that crisis managers should emphasize the need for organizational leaders to include employees as primary stakeholders in crisis management. Finally, this study demonstrates the need for researchers to further investigate different social media tools to assess their impact on internal crisis communication. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,"Ministry of Higher Education, Malaysia, MOHE

Although social media facilitate protests, they may also create a lazy form of activism known as slacktivism, potentially weakening the strength of a social movement. This dichotomy suggests the need to develop a theory to understand the connection between social media engagement, empowerment, and protest participation. We explore this connection via in-depth interviews with those who used social media in a case of social media-driven protest. Rather than limit analysis to outcomes like social media analytics, this research suggests the need to consider a model-based understanding of engagement, namely that social media activism proceeds from engagement antecedents and is supported by engagement attributes, towards, ultimately, engagement outcomes. Additionally, data suggest that this process is mediated by factors that include communicative competence, empowerment, and social stake. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Arnstein, S.R., A ladder of citizen participation (1969) Journal of American Planning Association, 35 (4), pp. 216-224; Barker, V., Dozier, D.M., Weiss, A.S., Borden, D.L., Harnessing peer potency: Predicting positive outcomes from social capital affinity and online engagement with participatory websites (2015) New Media & Society, 17, pp. 1603-1623; Bastos, M.T., Mercea, D., Charpentier, A., Tents, tweets, and events: The interplay between ongoing protests and social media (2015) Journal of Communication, 65, pp. 320-350; Bennett, W.L., Wells, C., Freelon, D., Communicating civic engagement: Contrasting models of citizenship in the youth web sphere (2011) Journal of Communication, 61, pp. 835-856; Botha, E., Mills, A.J., Managing the new media: Tools for brand management in social media (2012) Online consumer behavior: Theory and research in social media, advertising and E-tail, pp. 83-100. , Close A., (ed), New York, NY: Taylor & Francis, &,.

This research focuses on two countries that often dominate in international public diplomacy efforts and examines how Russian and American youth view the current relations between Russia and the United States (U.S.). The article contributes to advancing research on coorientation theory and argues that coorientation can be one of the theoretical foundations for the strategic communication field. Using the official documents produced by both countries, the study first identifies major issues affecting their relations. Then, using survey methodology, the study collects data from both U.S. and Russian respondents related to these issues. Previous research identified four major coorientation scenarios–monolithic consensus, pluralistic ignorance, false consensus, and dissensus. The study’s findings suggest that the type of coorientation scenario that best characterizes the U.S.-Russia relations is dissensus. The results also highlight the status of strategic communication as an interdisciplinary science with coorientation theory’s psychological roots providing a usable framework with a testable model for strategic communication scholarship. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Avery, E., Lariscy, R., Sweetser, K.D., Social media and shared–Or divergent–Uses?

Following a growing scholarly interest in how ambiguity can be seen as a productive strategic resource in strategy work, this article focuses on the interdependency of clarity and ambiguity in corporate communication strategies. Through an exploratory study, using interpretive discourse analysis of interviews with employees at a corporate communication department, the present article analyses how the employees perceived the writing, reading, and enactment of their organisation’s new corporate communication strategy. The analysis reveals that the employees sometimes use shared understandings to produce ambiguity in relation to engagement and responsibility, and how they use ambiguity to create a shared understanding of objectives and practices. Though this co-presence might cause the members to feel a lack of ownership, it does not impede the department’s ability to execute strategy-work. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Abdallah, C., Langley, A., The double edge of ambiguity in strategic planning (2014) Journal of Management Studies, 51 (2), pp. 235-264; Alvesson, M., Leadership studies: From procedure and abstraction to reflexivity and situation (1996) The Leadership Quarterly, 7 (4), pp. 455-485; Alvesson, M., Kärreman, D., Varieties of discourse: On the study of organizations through discourse analysis (2000) Human Relations, 53 (9), pp. 1125-1149; Argenti, P.A., (2007) Strategic corporate communication, , New Delhi, India: Tata McGraw Hill; Ashcraft, K.L., Kuhn, T.R., Cooren, F., Constitutional amendments: “Materializing” organizational communication (2009) The Academy of Management Annals, 3 (1), pp. 1-64; Balmer, J.M.T., Greyser, S.A., (2003) Revealing the corporation: Perspectives on identity, image, reputation, corporate branding and corporate-level marketing, , London, UK: Routledge, &, (Eds; Bednarek, R., Paroutis, S., Sillince, J., Transcendence through rhetorical practices: Responding to paradox in the science sector (2017) Organization Studies, 38 (1), pp. 77-101; Chia, R., Rasche, A., Golsorkhi, D., Seidl, D., Rouleau, L., Vaara, E., Building and dwelling world-views.

The use of high-quality narratives in particular is recommended to facilitate the understanding of an innovation, facilitate trust in it, and promote the perception of innovative strength as well as the development of positive attitudes. However, to date virtually no empirical evidence has been presented to support these assumptions. Therefore, we conducted an experiment in which participants were exposed to messages about an innovation that varied in narrative quality (low vs. medium vs. high), and the messages were told in different forms that are typical of social media (nonserial vs. serial) to take account of the ever-increasing importance of these channels in innovation communication. The results show that the understanding of an innovation increases linearly with a message’s narrative quality, serial storytelling impedes understanding, and narrative quality is conducive to the attitude towards the innovator when the story is told in nonserial form and has a detrimental effect when told in serial form. Thus, the results show that the current view on storytelling’s potential is overly optimistic and that using high-quality narratives can, under certain conditions, also have adverse effects. The practical implications of these findings are discussed. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Abbott, H.P., Hühn, P., Meister, J.C., Pier, J., Schmid, W., Narrativity (2014) The living handbook of narratology, , http://www.lhn.uni-hamburg.de/article/narrativity, Hamburg,. &, (Eds.),.

Results indicate activists’ sophisticated use of framing strategies following different stages of the issue life cycle to legitimately form an issue and successfully manage the issue in order to achieve their goals. This study offers meaningful theoretical implications for examining strategic communication in social movement campaigns. It also discusses practical lessons for applying these strategies to foster social change in similar contexts. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Anderson, D.S., Identifying and responding to activist publics: A case study (1992) Journal of Public Relations Research, 4 (3), pp. 151-165; Anderson, W.B., Social movements and public relations in the early twentieth century: How one group used public relations to curtail venereal disease rates (2017) Journal of Public Relations Research, 29 (1), pp. 3-15; Benford, R.D., Snow, D.A., Framing processes and social movements: An overview and assessment (2000) Annual Review of Sociology, 26, pp. 611-639; Berg, B., (2001) Qualitative research methods for the social sciences, , 4th, Boston, MA: Allyn and Bacon, ed; Bobel, C., ‘I’m not an activist, though I’ve done a lot of it’: Doing activism, being activist and the ‘perfect standard’ in a contemporary movement (2007) Social Movement Studies, 6 (2), pp. 147-159; Boyle, M.P., McCluskey, M.R., Devanathan, N., Stein, S.E., McLeod, D., The influence of level of deviance and protest type on coverage of social protest in Wisconsin from 1960 to 1999 (2004) Mass Communication & Society, 7 (1), pp. 43-60; Braun, V., Clarke, V., Using thematic analysis in psychology (2006) Qualitative Research in Psychology, 3 (2), pp. 77-101; Brunner, E., Wild public networks and affective movements in China: Environmental activism, social media, and protest in Maoming (2017) Journal of Communication, 67 (5), pp. 665-677; Ciszek, E.L., Digital activism: How social media and dissensus inform theory and practice (2016) Public Relations Review, 42 (2), pp. 314-321; Coombs, W.T., The failure of the task force on food assistance: A case study of the role of legitimacy in issue management (1992) Journal of Public Relations Research, 4 (2), pp. 101-122; Coombs, W.T., The internet as potential equalizer: New leverage for confronting social irresponsibility (1998) Public Relations Review, 24 (3), pp. 289-303; Cox, L., Nilsen, A.G., Barker, C., Tyldesley, M., “At the heart of society burns the fire of social movements”: What would a Marxist theory of social movements look like?

Interviews were conducted with 27 senior-level internal communication practitioners working for global companies. Practitioners said they use a variety of communication channels, including social media, to drive employee engagement. The findings revealed best practices in using internal social media to engage employees, including providing clear social media policies and employee training; empowering employee social advocates; involving leadership and securing endorsement; social media listening; sharable, relevant, and practical content strategies; and, authenticity and consistency. Future trends and evolvement of internal communication around social media are also discussed. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,"Pennsylvania State University, PSU",The authors thank the Arthur W.

One way companies can demonstrate legitimacy in their CSR efforts is by supporting causes that are perceived to “fit.” The goal of this study is to explore the effects of company–cause fit within the context of the CSR strategy of femvertising. Femvertising is defined as “advertising that employs pro-female talent, messages, and imagery to empower women and girls.” A survey of U.S. adults (n = 419) was employed to investigate consumer attitude toward femvertising as well as four specific femvertising messages as they related to respondents’ perceptions of company–cause fit, CSR associations, and purchase intentions. This study also examined the mediating roles of two related mechanisms–perceived organization-public relationship quality and company loyalty–in connecting CSR associations and purchase intention. The findings suggest that within a femvertising context, purchase intention is impacted by CSR associations and company–cause fit both directly and through loyalty. The findings clarify how company support of women-empowering causes can be an effective CSR strategy and how it fits with the current strategic communication literature. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Aaker, D.A., Brand extensions: The good, the bad, and the ugly (1990) MIT Sloan Management Review, 31 (4), pp. 47-56; Aaker, D.A., (1991) Managing brand equity: Capitalizing on the value of a brand name, , New York, NY: Free Press; Abitbol, A., Sternadori, M., You act like a girl: An examination of consumer perceptions of femvertising (2016) Quarterly Review of Business Disciplines, 3 (2), pp. 117-138; Assael, H., (1998) Consumer behavior and marketing action, , 6th, Cincinnati, OH: South-Western College Publishing, ed; Baldinger, A.L., Rubinson, J., Brand loyalty: The link between attitude and behavior (1996) Journal of Advertising Research, 36 (6), pp. 22-35; Bandyopadhyay, S., Martell, M., Does attitudinal loyalty influence behavioral loyalty?

To address this gap, this study introduces the concept employee communication responsibility and offers insight into factors influencing employees’ predisposition towards taking communication responsibility. Data were obtained from 4,726 employees working in ten Swedish organizations. Half the sample (2,244) was used for exploratory factor analysis that enabled the identification of a smaller number of factors to construct a model with four hypotheses, and half the sample (2,482) was used to test the proposed model through structural equation modeling (SEM). Hypotheses formulation was informed by previous research examining factors influencing employees’ communication. The study shows that all tested factors, internal communication climate openness, immediate supervisor communication, top management–employee communication, and perceived importance of communication significantly contribute to employees’ predisposition towards taking communication responsibility. Thus, the study provide knowledge useful to researchers interested in employees’ communication, and to strategic communication practitioners responsible for internal communication and employees’ communication. © 2018, Published with license by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC © 2018 [Rickard Andersson].",,,,,,,,,,"Allen, M.W., Communication and organizational commitment: Perceived organizational support as a mediating factor (1992) Communication Quarterly, 40 (4), pp. 357-367; Allison, P.D., Missing data techniques for structural equation modeling (2003) Journal of Abnormal Psychology, 112 (4), pp. 545-557; Alvesson, M., (2004) Knowledge work and knowledge-intensive firms, , Oxford, UK: Oxford university press; Ashish, M., Bishop, J.W., Dow, S., Does trust in top management mediate top management communication, employee involvement and organizational commitment relationships?

This research focuses on the characteristics, objectives, and practices of chief communication officers (CCOs) with successful measurement and evaluation programs. Three key dimensions of practice emerged from in-depth interviews: communication executives’ measurement practices and evaluation programs were used to adjust communication strategies; were aligned with other business units; and were integrated with business priority plans. Interviewees also focused on the ability of communication measurement practices and evaluation programs to provide insights for executives, to align communication with the work of other business units, and to connect the organization with the outside environment and stakeholders. This study extends strategic communication scholarship by discussing how overcoming barriers and advancing measurement and evaluation work relates to roles adopted by organizational leaders. This article also offers a preliminary, scalable maturity model that aids in the development, formalization, and optimization of strategic communication measurement and evaluation. This study demonstrates the capacity for communication evaluation to overcome perceived barriers, realize appropriate stature with organizations, and grow communication functions accordingly. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,Our research team appreciates a grant from the Institute for Public Relations that helped support research expenses.,,"Baerns, B., van Ruler, B., Tkalac Verčič, A., Verčič, D., Conclusions from a long-term project on professional public relations modeling and evaluation (2008) Public relations metrics: Research and evaluation, pp. 154-169. , New York, NY: Routledge,. &, (Eds; Baskin, O., Hahn, J., Seaman, S., Reines, D., Perceived effectiveness and implementation of public relations measurement and evaluation tools among European providers and consumers of PR services (2010) Public Relations Review, 36, pp. 105-111; Blissland, J.H., Accountability gap: Evaluation practices show improvement (1990) Public Relations Review, 16 (2), pp. 25-35; Broom, G., Smith, G., Testing the practitioner’s impact on clients (1979) Public Relations Review, 5 (3), pp. 47-59; Buhmann, A., Likely, F., Evaluation and measurement in strategic communication The International Encyclopedia of Strategic Communication, , in press, R.

In the context of a natural disaster, this study examines how publics respond to CSR-based initiatives by way of mobile corporate social responsibility (mCSR), including gratifications, social media engagement, perceived CSR motives, and the relationship outcomes as associated with mCSR practice. An online survey was conducted by sampling with 1,433 nationally representative adults in the United States. Findings indicated that four broad types of gratification, such as technological convenience, social interaction, recreation, and information exchange, significantly influenced relationship outcomes such as satisfaction, commitment, distrust, trust, and control mutuality. Results also demonstrated that perceived CSR motives and social media engagement on mobile devices were significantly related to relationship outcomes, providing empirical evidence for the important role that potential mCSR communications can play in engaging publics and cultivating relationships during natural disasters. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,"Pennsylvania State University, PSU","This project was supported by a Page Legacy Scholar Grant from the Arthur W.

Such effect is subject to the interaction between incidental and integral emotions. To effectively use emotional appeal in public service announcements (PSAs) for non-profit communication, studying the interaction between the carryover and direct effects of incidental and integral emotions, respectively, is specifically informative. In particular, this study focuses on the application of pride and hope as discrete integral emotions in blood donation PSAs, as well as the interaction between two integral and incidental emotions (i.e., potential donors’ pre-existing emotions of anger and fear before viewing PSAs). Results of a 2 × 2 factorial experiment involving 313 participants suggested that the congruence in appraisal dimensions between incidental and integral emotions could lead to improved effectiveness of perceived message, strong issue advocacy, high intention for blood donation, and enhanced attitudes for non-profit organizations. Furthermore, theoretical and practical implications are discussed in this research. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Agrawal, N., Menon, G., Aaker, J.L., Getting emotional about health (2007) Journal of Marketing Research, 44 (1), pp. 100-113; Allen, C.T., Machleit, K.A., Marine, S.S., Micheal, J., On assessing the emotionality of advertising via Izard’s differential emotions scale (1988) Advances in consumer research, 15, pp. 226-231. , Provo, UT: Association for Consumer Research, &,.

Automated content analysis methods were employed to analyze sentiment and emotionality and to identify corporate topics related to the companies. A positive relation of the amount of coverage and emotionality with the fluctuation of stock prices was detected for Shell and Philips. In addition, corporate topics were found to positively Granger cause stock price fluctuation, particularly for Philips. The study advances past research in showing that the prediction of stock price fluctuation based on media coverage can be improved by including sentiment, emotionality, and corporate topics. The findings inform strategic communication, and particularly investor relations, in suggesting that media attention, sentiment, and certain corporate topics are crucial when managing media relations and with regard to securing a fair evaluation of listed companies. Furthermore, the innovative research methods are useful for researchers and practitioners alike in showcasing how media coverage related to firms and their stock fluctuations can be identified and analyzed in a reproducible, hands-on and efficient manner. © 2017 [Joanna Strycharz, Nadine Strauss, and Damian Trilling].",,,,,,,,This study was carried out on the Dutch national e-infrastructure with the support of the SURF Foundation.,,"Ahmad, K., Hutson, E., Kearney, C., Liu, S., (2014) Media Pessimism and Stock Returns: A Time-Varying Analysis at the Firm Level, pp. 1-27. , http://eprints.soton.ac.uk/365557/1/Equity%20paper_INFINITI.pdf; Alanyali, M., Moat, H.S., Preis, T., Quantifying the relationship between financial news and the stock market (2013) Scientific Reports, 3, p. 3578; Antweiler, W., Frank, M.Z., Is all that talk just noise?

To date, most studies on the subject have relied on social identity theory, which focuses on cognitive categorization processes but overlooks the role of employees’ relationships within their organization. In this research, we introduce a social capital perspective into organizational identification models. We propose and test a model looking at the influence of an individual’s social capital, a variable deriving from different dimensions of an individual’s communication network (i.e., prestige, resourceful others, friendship), on organizational identification, mediated by the attractiveness of perceived organizational identity. The results from a survey conducted in a business organization suggest that a person’s social capital influences organizational identification, both directly and through the attractiveness of perceived organizational identity. Our organizational identification model contributes to extend knowledge on the complementarity of the cognitive and relational perspectives of strategic communication and on the role of relationship building and networks in strategic communication management. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Adler, P., Kwon, S., Social capital: Prospects for a new concept (2002) Academy of Management Review, 27, pp. 17-40; Ancona, D.G., Caldwell, D.F., Bridging the boundary: External activity and performance in organizational teams (1992) Administrative Science Quarterly, 37, pp. 634-665; Andrews, S.B., Basler, C.R., Coller, X., Organizational structures, cultures, and identities: Overlaps and divergences (1999) Research in the Sociology of Organizations, 16, pp. 213-235; Apker, J., Ford, W.S.Z., Fox, D.H., Predicting nurses’ organizational and professional identification: The effect of nursing roles, professional autonomy, and supportive communication (2003) Nursing Economics, 21 (5), pp. 226-232; Ashforth, B.E., Mael, F., Social identity theory and the organization (1989) Academy of Management Review, 14, pp. 20-39; Ashforth, B.E., The experience of powerlessness in organizations (1989) Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes, 43, pp. 207-242; Atouba, Y.C., Carlson, E.J., Lammers, J.C., Directives and dialogue: Examining the relationship between participative organizational communication practices and organizational identification among IT workers (2016) International Journal of Business Communication; Bantel, K.A., Jackson, S.E., Top management and innovations in banking: Does the composition of the top team make a difference?

With a public-centric perspective, our study highlights how social media publics interact with each other (i.e., interdependence) and share different information through crisis stages (i.e., dynamics). Following the situational approach to segmentation, we identify different types of social media publics (i.e., influentials, broadcasters, and followers) based on their informational behaviors and their positions in an information sharing network. Crisis managers are recommended to pay more attention to publics with higher influence, namely key influentials and broadcasters. In addition, we try to understand social media publics’ changing concerns by analyzing whether and how publics share messages of different themes and forms in different stages of a crisis. Crisis managers are recommended to customize crisis communication content to fit publics’ needs, prioritize organizational resources, and maximize positive communication effect. With big data from Chipotle’s E. coli crisis, we analyzed the Twitter activities surrounding this crisis over a 6-month period. Our segmentation receives initial support from the network analysis and content analysis on the Twitter data, which lays the foundation for effective social media crisis management. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Atkin, C.K., Instrumental utilities and information seeking (1973) New Models for Communication Research, pp. 205-242. , In P.

Consistent with the scope of strategic communication research, this study incorporates theoretical aspects of distinct areas of organizational communication to examine audience response to strategic messages, and makes recommendations for organizational communication strategies during crisis situations. The findings demonstrate that, instead of taking messages straightforwardly, people interpret the same messages divergently in their own ways, and these interpretations accordingly affect their attitudes and behavioral intentions. Findings indicate participants choose a dominant interpretation when given mixed messages, and subsequent responses are based on the initial interpretation, such that evaluating a mixed message as an apology yielded more positive outcomes than those who interpreted the message in other ways. In addition to people’s diverse interpretations, organizations’ crisis communication strategies and the business type also significantly influenced the outcomes. The apology-interpreters showed more positive outcomes than those who were exposed only to apology for an automaker’s crisis. On the other hand, for a nonprofit organization’s crisis, those who were exposed to a simple denial message showed more positive outcomes than those who perceived the mixed message as a denial. Based on these findings, this study offers practical recommendations on when to use single messages versus mixed messages, along with the explanation of how these divergent strategies work. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Beard, C., Amir, N., Interpretation in social anxiety: When meaning precedes ambiguity (2009) Cognitive Therapy & Research, 33 (4), pp. 406-415; Benoit, W.L., Millar, D.P., Heath, R.L., Image restoration discourse and crisis communication (2004) Responding to crisis: A rhetorical approach to crisis communication, pp. 263-280. , Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates,. &, (Eds; Berger, P.L., Luckmann, T., (1966) The social construction of reality: A treatise in the sociology of knowledge, , Garden City, NY: Anchor Books; Brewer, E.C., Holmes, T.L., Obfuscating the obvious (2009) Journal of Business Communication, 46 (4), pp. 480-496; Brown, T.J., Dacin, P.A., The company and the product: Corporate associations and consumer product responses (1997) Journal of Marketing, 61 (1), pp. 68-84; Cherry, J., The impact of normative influence and locus of control on ethical judgments and intentions: A cross-cultural comparison (2006) 01674544, , http://proxy-remote.galib.uga.edu/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=bth&AN=22838588&site=ehost-live, Retrieved from; Chew, F., The advertising value of making possible a public television program (1992) Journal of Advertising Research, 32 (6), pp. 47-52; Chomsky, N., Chomsky, N., An interview on minimalism (2002) On nature and language, pp. 92-161. , New York, NY: Cambridge University Press,.

The themes are identified by a systematic content analysis of peer-reviewed journal articles and conference papers (n = 104) published between 2004 and 2017. Five overall thematic “lessons” are identified and critically discussed. These are that effective social media crisis communication is about: (1) exploiting social media’s potential to create dialogue and to choose the right message, source and timing; (2) performing precrisis work and developing an understanding of the social media logic; (3) using social media monitoring; (4) continuing to prioritize traditional media in crisis situations; and finally, (5) just using social media in strategic crisis communication. These guidelines mainly emerged from quantitative research conducted in the context of the United Stated and on Twitter. There is need for more research focusing on other platforms and other empirical material. There is also a future need for an in-depth methodological discussion of how to further bridge the gap between research and practice on a global scale, and how to develop more evidence-based recommendations for strategic crisis communication practitioners. © 2018, Published with license by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC. © 2018, © 2018 [Mats Eriksson].",,,,,,,"Myndigheten fÃ¶r SamhÃ¤llsskydd och Beredskap, MSB",This work was supported by the Swedish Civil Contingencies Agency.,,"Abedin, B., Babar, A., Abbasi, A., Characterization of the use of social media in natural disasters: A systematic review (2014) Big Data and Cloud Computing (Bdcloud), 2014; (2013) Social media and disasters: Best practices and lessons learned disaster preparedness summit, August 21, 2013, , https://www.redcross.org/images/MEDIA_CustomProductCatalog/m22442828_Social_Media_-_Suzanne_Bernier_-_SB_Crisis_Consulting.pdf, Retrieved from; An, S.-K., Cheng, I.-H., Coombs, W.T., Holladay, S.J., Crisis communication research in public relations journals: Tracking research trends over thirty years (2010) The handbook of crisis communication research, pp. 65-90. , Hoboken, NJ: Wiley-Blackwell, &,. &, (Eds; Andrews, C., Fichet, E., Ding, Y., Spiro, E.S., Starbird, K., Keeping up with the Tweet-dashians: The impact of ‘Official’ accounts on online rumoring (2016) Proceedings of the 19th ACM Conference on Computer-Supported Cooperative Work & Social Computing 2016, pp. 452-465; Arlikatti, S., Taibah, H.A., Andrew, S.A., How do you warn them if they speak only Spanish?

The purpose of this research is to take a talent management approach to gain a deep understanding of millennial communication professionals’ (MCPs) generational attributes as related to their workplace values, and how such values would affect key phases such as recruitment, engagement, development and retention in talent management in strategic communication. Two national panels were recruited to run comparative analyses with one panel consisting of MCPs and the other panel consisting of communication managers and executives who have direct working and/or supervising experience with MCPs. The comparative results provide a detailed report on perceptual gaps on generational attributes, as well as different expectations on talent management. Research and practical implications are discussed. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"(2016), https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/global/Documents/About-Deloitte/gx-millenial-survey-2016-exec-summary.pdf, Retrieved from; Ariss, A.A., Cascio, W.F., Paauwe, J., Talent management: Current theories and future research directions (2014) Journal of World Business, 49 (2), pp. 173-179; Behrens, W., Managing millennials (2009) Marketing Health Services, 29 (1), pp. 19-21; Bolton, R.N., Parasuraman, A., Hoefnagels, A., Migchels, N., Kabadayi, S., Gruber, T., Solnet, D., Understanding generation Y and their use of social media: A review and research agenda (2013) Journal of Service Management, 24 (3), pp. 245-267. , …; Cafasso, E., Millennials in the workplace (2007) Public Relations Strategist, 13 (4), pp. 38-40; Collings, D.G., Mellahi, K., Strategic talent-management: A review and research agenda (2009) Human Resource Management Review, 19, pp. 304-313; Curtin, P.A., Gallicano, T.D., Matthews, K., Millennials’ approaches to ethical decision making (2011) Public Relations Journal, 5 (2), pp. 1-22; Deal, J., Altman, D., Rogelberg, S., Millennials at work: What we know and what we need to do (If anything) (2010) Journal of Business & Psychology, 25 (2), pp. 191-199; Farrell, L., Hurt, A.C., Training the millennial generation: Implications for organizational climate (2014) E Journal of Organizational Learning & Leadership, 12 (1), pp. 47-60; Ferri-Reed, J., Three ways leaders can help millennials succeed (2012) Journal for Quality & Participation, 35 (1), pp. 18-19; Fröhlich, R., Young future PR-professionals: Perceptions of the future occupational field and assessment of current PR education.

Using agenda-setting as a theoretical framework and the seven devices developed by the Institute for Propaganda Analysis (IPA) in the late 1930s as a deductive tool, this article demonstrates that the Brotherhood’s communication strategy strongly aligned with the seven devices developed by the IPA: more than one technique was identified in 97% of the movement’s communiqués analyzed. These findings indicate that persuasive techniques are being used by the Brotherhood as strategic communication devices to serve the goals of 1) discrediting the current military regime; 2) winning the hearts and minds of Egyptians; and, 3) establishing themselves as a legitimate political actor. This case study advances second-level agenda setting theory by suggesting that the IPA’s persuasive techniques reveal the specific mechanisms through which the Brotherhood seek to achieve their communication goals. By raising awareness of these techniques as a critical means of setting the Brotherhood’s agenda, this article also seeks to empower domestic and regional audiences consuming these messages. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"(2013) The social intelligence report, , https://success.adobe.com/assets/en/downloads/whitepaper/13926_di_social_sentiment_v10.pdf, Retrieved from; (2013) Cult growing around Egypt’s general sisi, , http://english.alarabiya.net/en/perspective/analysis/2013/08/01/Cult-growing-around-Egypt-s-General-Sisi-.html, August, Retrieved from; (2012) Egypt to remember Maspero clashes on Tuesday, , http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/1/64/55087/Egypt/Politics-/Egypt-to-remember-Maspero-clashes-on-Tuesday.aspx, October, Retrieved from; Al-Anani, K., (2016) Inside the Muslim Brotherhood: Religion, identity, and politics, , Oxford, UK: Oxford University Press; Alexander, Y., Kraft, M., (2007) Evolution of US counterterrorism policy, 2. , Westport, CT: Praeger Security International; (2014) Sisi mocked in Egypt internet campaign, , http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2014/03/sisi-mocked-egypt-internet-campaign-201433022548298607.html, March, Retrieved from; Allen, A., Just whose side is god on?

We argue that strategic communication encompasses all communication that is substantial for the survival and sustained success of an entity. Specifically, strategic communication is the purposeful use of communication by an entity to engage in conversations of strategic significance to its goals. Entity includes all kind of organizations (e.g., corporations, governments, or nonprofits), as well as social movements and known individuals in the public sphere. Communication can play a distinctive role for the formulation, revision, presentation, execution, implementation, and operationalization of strategies. While there are many ways to investigate these research objects, strategic communication as a discipline takes the perspective of the focal organization/entity and its calculus to achieve specific goals by means of communication under conditions of limited resources and uncertainty. The article takes a critical look at the current state of the field and outlines several requirements that will help scholars and practitioners alike to build a unique body of knowledge in strategic communication. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Alvesson, M., Spicer, A., (2016) The stupidity paradox: The power and pitfalls of functional stupidity at work, , London, UK: Profile Books; Argenti, P.A., (2016) Corporate communication, , 7th, New York, NY: McGraw-Hill, ed; Argenti, P.A., Howell, R.A., Beck, K.A., The strategic communication imperative (2005) MIT Sloan Management Review, 46 (3), pp. 83-89; Bernays, E., (1928) Propaganda, , New York, NY: Horace Liveright; Bloom, R.W., Gal, R., Mangelsdorff, A.D., Propaganda and active measures (1991) Handbook of military psychology, pp. 693-709. , Chichester, UK: John Wiley & Sons,. &, (Eds; Botan, C.H., (2018) Strategic communication theory and practice: The cocreational model, , Hoboken, NJ: Wiley Blackwell; Broom, G.M., Sha, B.-L., (2013) Cutlip and Center’s effective public relations, , 11th int., Harlow, UK: Pearson, &, ed; Chadwick, A., (2013) The hybrid media system: Politics and power, , Oxford, UK: Oxford University Press; Clausewitz, C., (1989) On war.

The disciplinary status of strategic communication is described through a content analysis of manuscripts published in the International Journal of Strategic Communication since its inaugural issue in 2007 (N = 207). Results reveal positive trends in research productivity, authorship, and globalization of the discipline over an 11-year period. However, analysis of the methodological and theoretical attributes of strategic communication scholarship suggests that more interdisciplinary research is needed. This study proposes definitional refinements that may strengthen the consistency of purpose among strategic communication scholars for future research and theory building.

Drawing on ideas about the evolution of academic disciplines proposed by Alexander M. Shneider, we argue that strategic communication is currently caught in a cycle of constant reinvention obscured by a discourse of emergence. Although the discipline is undoubtedly becoming more sophisticated, it is doubtful whether there is genuine progress. The authors examine facets of strategic communication that contribute to the current state of affairs. Although clearer conceptualization and a more realistic understanding of the discipline are identified as a prerequisite for maturation, progress—as opposed to sophistication—ultimately depends on the development of discipline-specific, unique, and robust methods. © 2018, Published with license by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC © 2018 [Howard Nothhaft, Kelly Page Werder, Dejan Verčič, and Ansgar Zerfass].",,,,,,,,,,"Alvesson, M., (2013) The triumph of emptiness: Consumption, higher education, and work organization, , Oxford, UK: Oxford University Press; Baecker, D., (2003) Organisation und Management, , Frankfurt am Main, Germany: Suhrkamp; Buhmann, A., Likely, F., Geddes, D., Communication evaluation and measurement: Connecting research to practice (2018) Journal of Communication Management, 22 (1), pp. 113-119; Caplan, B., (2018) The case against education: Why the education system is a waste of time and money, , Princeton, NJ: Princeton UP; Choi, B., Pak, A., Multidisciplinarity, interdisciplinarity and transdisciplinarity in health research, services, education and policy: 1.

The perspective embraces the various disciplinary traditions that are found under the strategic communication umbrella (e.g., advertising, corporate communication, organizational communication, and public relations) and gives primacy to communication as the constitutive element through which organizations make strategic decisions about network positioning and representation to stakeholders. We begin with an overview of the trends in strategic communication that suggest a network perspective is a viable and timely approach. Next, we present the underlying assumptions of a network perspective and identify the six network types applicable to strategic communication research and practice: activity coordination, affiliation, affinity, flow, representational, and semantic. Finally, we introduce a set of propositions to illustrate the heuristic value of the approach and lay the groundwork for future theorizing. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Albright, J., (2016) The #Election2016 micro-propaganda machine, , https://medium.com/@d1gi/the-election2016-micro-propaganda-machine-383449cc1fba, Retrieved from; Allagui, I., Breslow, H., Social media for public relations: Lessons from four effective cases (2016) Public Relations Review, 42 (1), pp. 20-30; Bortree, D.S., Seltzer, T., Dialogic strategies and outcomes: An analysis of environmental advocacy groups’ Facebook profiles (2009) Public Relations Review, 35 (3), pp. 317-319; Carley, K.M., (2017) Automap, , Pittsburgh, PA:Center for Computational Analysis of Social and Organizational Research, Institute for Software Research International, Carnegie Mellon University; Carley, K.M., Kaufer, D.S., Semantic connectivity: An approach for analyzing symbols in semantic networks (1993) Communication Theory, 3 (3), pp. 183-213; Cheney, G., Christensen, L.T., Jablin, F., Putnam, L.L., Organizational identity: Linkages between internal and external communication (2001) The new handbook of organizational communication: Advances in theory, research, and methods, pp. 231-269. , Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage, &,. &, (Eds; (2017) Our values, , http://www.chiquita.com/about-chiquita/ourvalues, Retrieved from; (2013) Cone communications launches new influencer identification platform, , http://www.conecomm.com/news-blog/conefluence, Retrieved from; (2014) Cone communications digital activism study, , http://www.conecomm.com/research-blog/2014-cone-communications-digital-activism-study, Retrieved from; Coombs, W.T., The failure of the task force on food assistance: A case study of the role of legitimacy in issue management (1992) Journal of Public Relations Research, 4 (2), pp. 101-122; Coombs, W.T., Holladay, S.J., Public relations’ “Relationship Identity” in research: Enlightenment or illusion (2015) Public Relations Review, 41 (5), pp. 689-695; Crable, R.E., Vibbert, S.L., Managing issues and influencing public policy (1985) Public Relations Review, 11 (2), pp. 3-16; Dabirian, A., Kietzmann, J., Diba, H., A great place to work!?

However, embracing the idea of emergence comes with several definitional, methodological, and programmatic challenges. This article responds to these challenges by proposing a dual narrative framework of strategic communication. The framework introduces an approach that explains both practice (strategizing process) and product (strategized communication) of strategic communication as narratively constituted and draws a distinction between preceding and proceeding forms of emergence. Preceding forms of emergence address the impact of strategic fashions and peripheral forms of strategizing on strategic communication. Proceeding forms of emergence address strategy attribution and strategy reframing that accompany strategic communication. The article contributes to a meaningful integration of the idea of emergence without tautologizing the concept of strategic communication. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Abrahamson, E., The iron cage: Ugly, uncool, and unfashionable (2011) Organization Studies, 32 (5), pp. 615-629; Aggerholm, H.K., Asmuß, B., A practice perspective on strategic communication.

Looking at modern strategy theory, this article focuses on communication theory as an ongoing process of meaning construction. It posits that communication is a process that is interactive by nature and participatory at all levels. This process is not necessarily two-way but omnidirectional diachronic, with an emphasis on the external and internal arenas of continuous meaning presentations, negotiations, and constructions. Strategic communication, therefore, needs to be conceptualized as an agile management process in which the focus is on feeding these arenas for strategy building and implementation, and on testing strategic decisions by presenting and negotiating these in a continuous loop. © 2018, Published with license by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC © 2018 [Betteke van Ruler].",,,,,,,,,,"Aggerholm, H.K., Thomsen, C., Holtzhausen, D.R., Zerfass, A., Strategic communication: The role of polyphony in management team meetings (2015) The Routledge handbook of strategic communication, pp. 172-189. , New York, NY: Routledge, &,. &, (Eds; Argenti, P.A., Howel, R.A., Beck, K.A., The strategic communication imperative (2005) MITSloan Management Review, 46 (3), pp. 83-89; Argyris, C., (1994) On organizational learning, , Cambridge, MA: Blackwell; Ashcraft, K., Kuhn, T., Cooren, F., Constitutional amendments: “Materializing” organizational communication (2009) Academy of Management Annals, 3, pp. 1-64; Berger, P., Luckmann, T., (1966) The social construction of reality.

Research in strategic communication has mostly focused on communication professionals working in communication departments or agencies as primary agents of communication. However, this reflects a limited comprehension of organizations.

These mechanisms evolved to solve long standing problems in the human ancestral environment. Cooperation in small foraging tribal communities of hunters and gatherers, and its use to gain reproductive advantages, was one of the problems the human mind has adapted to. Thus, this article argues that adopting evolutionary psychology as a framework for strategic communication research can improve understanding of why strategic communication exists in human societies and how it works. The idea of the modularity of mind suggests that separate modules inside the mind evolved during our evolutionary history to solve ancestral challenges. Some of these modules embody human fundamental motives, which can by triggered by strategic communication. By tapping into fundamental motives such as the longing for status, affiliation, and kin-care, strategic communication is able to exploit ancestral stimuli in today’s information society. Thus, a research program based on evolutionary psychology could be a valuable contribution to the field’s growing body of knowledge. © 2018, Published with license by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC © 2018 [Jens Seiffert-Brockmann].",,,,,,,,,,"Aldrich, H., Herker, D., Boundary spanning roles and organization structure (1977) The Academy of Management Review, 2 (2), pp. 217-230; Arpan, L.M., Pompper, D., Stormy weather: Testing “stealing thunder” as a crisis communication strategy to improve communication flow between organizations and journalists (2003) Public Relations Review, 29 (3), pp. 291-308; Barkow, J.H., Barkow, J.H., Cosmides, L., Tooby, J., Beneath new culture is old psychology: Gossip and social stratification (1992) The adapted mind.

Therefore, measurement and evaluation models and approaches provide insights into strategy. Furthermore, the most widely used approaches to evaluation are based on program logic models that identify objectives, planning, and inputs, as well as seek to track outputs, outcomes and impact, thus affording insights into the origins of strategy and strategic intent as well as its implementation. Given increasing focus on emergent strategy and participatory or networked strategy in place of internally predetermined strategy that is unilaterally focused on an organization’s goals and objectives, this article critically reviews widely used models for evaluation of communication to identify how well they support and enable broader contemporary approaches to organizational strategy and strategic communication. This analysis shows a narrow organization-centric focus on evaluating organizational messaging (one-way communication) directed at achieving organizational objectives in traditional evaluation models and calls for a more open, dynamic, and expanded approach to facilitate two-way communication. Furthermore, in showing the important role of formative as well as summative evaluation, this analysis identifies a number of ways that evaluation of communication can inform organizational strategy and transform strategic communication. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Aarts, N., (2009) Een gesprek zonder einde [A never ending conversation], , Amsterdam, Netherlands: Vosspuspers; Aarts, N., Van Woerkum, C., (2008) Strategische communicatie [Strategic communication], , Assen, The Netherlands: Van Gorcum; (2017) Integrated evaluation framework, , http://amecorg.com/amecframework, London, UK: Author, Retrieved from; Bakhtin, M., (1986) Speech genres and other late essays, , C.

Building upon a comprehensive literature review and systematization of concepts at the nexus of strategic communication and management research, a working definition and an integrative conceptual framework of alignment of strategic communication are suggested. The new definition describes alignment of strategic communication both as an outcome and an ongoing process and introduces a distinction between primary and secondary alignment. The new framework combines the multiple perspectives and types of alignment discussed so far, differentiating between external and internal alignment, intrafunctional and cross-functional alignment, management–strategy–activities alignment and process–structure–culture–people alignment. Six avenues for future conceptual, empirical, and critical research are pointed out to provide inspiration for strategic communication scholars to carry forward research of the alignment concept. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Alagaraja, M., Rose, K., Shuck, B., Bergman, M., Unpacking organizational alignment: The view from theory and practice (2015) Journal of Organizational Learning and Leadership, 13 (1), pp. 18-31; Alagaraja, M., Shuck, B., Exploring organizational alignment-employee engagement linkages and impact on individual performance: A conceptual model (2015) Human Resource Development Review, 14 (1), pp. 17-37; Alvesson, M., Spicer, A., A stupidity-based theory of organizations (2012) Journal of Management Studies, 49 (7), pp. 1194-1220; Argenti, P.A., (2016) Corporate communication (7th ed.), , New York, NY: McGraw-Hill; Argenti, P.A., Howell, R.A., Beck, K.A., The strategic communication imperative (2005) MIT Sloan Management Review, 46 (3), pp. 83-89; Avison, D., Jones, J., Powell, P., Wilson, D., Using and validating the strategic alignment model (2004) Journal of Strategic Information Systems, 13, pp. 223-246; Baker, J., Jones, D., A theoretical framework for sustained strategic alignment and an agenda for research (2008) Proceedings of JAIS Theory Development Workshop.

One of the main reasons why democratic states find it difficult to achieve victory in such asymmetrical conflicts is the tendency of NSAs to work within civilian populations; when democratic states try to fight the NSAs, they lose in the media battle, which tends to focus on civilian casualties. Photos of dead civilians and destruction lead to increasing criticism of the democratic state. As can be expected, state representatives try to restore their state’s media image. The article integrates theories and models from crisis communication and image repair to suggest a new model that examines media strategies used by state representatives during asymmetrical conflicts. The case study is based mainly on qualitative content analysis backed up by quantitative analysis of interviews given by Israeli representatives to the non-Israeli English media during the Gaza conflict in the summer of 2014. According to the model, a state’s representatives can use three kinds of strategies to repair their country image: source, message, and audience. The model can be used to analyze the image repair efforts of democratic countries during asymmetrical conflicts. © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Avraham, E., Marketing and managing nation branding during prolonged crisis: The case of Israel (2009) Place Branding and Public Diplomacy, 5 (3), pp. 202-212; Avraham, E., Changing the conversation: How developing countries handle the international media during disasters, conflicts and crises (2017) Journal of Information Policy, 7, pp. 275-296; Avraham, E., Ketter, E., (2008) Media strategies for marketing places in crisis: Improving the image of cities, countries and tourist destinations, , Burlington, MA: Routledge; Avraham, E., Ketter, E., (2016) Marketing tourism for developing countries: Battling stereotypes and crises in Asia, Africa and the Middle East, , London, UK: Palgrave-McMillan; Ayalon, A., Popovich, E., Yarchi, M., From warfare to imagefare: How states should manage asymmetric conflicts with extensive media coverage (2016) Terrorism And Political Violence, 28, pp. 254-273; Benoit, L.W., (2015) Accounts, excuses, and apologies: A theory of image restoration strategies, , New York, NY: State University of New York Press; Brinson, S.L., Benoit, W.L., The tarnished star restoring Texaco’s damaged public image (1999) Management Communication Quarterly, 12 (4), pp. 483-510; Coombs, W.T., The value of communication during a crisis: Insights from strategic communication research (2015) Business Horizons, 58 (2), pp. 141-148; Coombs, W.T., Holladay, S.J., (2010) PR, strategy and application.

Fox Foundation, and Live and Learn in Kenya. These organizations have raised millions of dollars/pounds/euros from avatars. The results reveal that social capital plays an important role in the motivation and success of virtual world fundraising activities, especially for individuals who may not otherwise engage due to physical, social, or geographic barriers. The results also highlight the opportunity for organizations to engage with international audiences and build active communities within virtual worlds. © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"(2017) Learn about relay, , https://secure.acsevents.org/site/SPageServer?pagename=relay_learn, Retrieved from; Avance, R., Peters, B., Community (2016) Digital keywords: A vocabulary of information society & culture, pp. 63-69. , Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press,.

The public may not view themselves as a stakeholder, particularly when they are unaware of, have no direct dealings with, or do not have any problems associated with such a corporation. The current study, utilizing a national survey of the United States public (N = 424) found that through directed strategic communication activities of a private spaceflight corporation, utilizing social and new media tools, a latent public can perceive a corporation and its mission in a positive manner, and transition it towards a status of an aware public and possible active public. Positive perceptions were found regarding corporate credibility, brand awareness, public engagement, communicating a corporate mission, educating the public, and influencing public opinion. © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Aldoory, L., Grunig, J.E., The rise and fall of hot-issue publics: Relationships that develop from media coverage of events and crises (2012) International Journal of Strategic Communication, 6, pp. 93-108; Aldrin, B., (2013) Mission to Mars: My vision for space exploration, , Washington, D.C.: National Geographic; Anderson, C., Rethinking public-private space travel (2013) Space Policy, 29, pp. 266-271; Bellavita, C., Perspectives on public policy: Public policy, organization theory and space stations (1987) Policy Studies Review, 7, pp. 275-289; Billings, L., 50 years of NASA and the public: What NASA?

In doing so, we unpack how citizens’ perceptions of the communication strategy adopted by the government, as well perceived authenticity of the government’s communication impact their sentiments toward the government. An online survey was conducted in South Korea (N = 1112) to understand these relationships. The results revealed that perceived use of bridging strategy by the government is associated with public engagement, and perceived use of the buffering strategy is related to public cynicism. We also found perceived authenticity to be significantly associated with public engagement and negatively associated with cynicism. Finally, the two types of public sentiment were found to partially mediate between perceived government communication strategies and citizens’ positive and negative megaphoning. Theoretical and empirical implications are discussed. © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Agerdal-Hjermind, A., Valentini, C., Blogging as a communication strategy for government agencies; A Danish case study (2015) International Journal of Strategic Communication, 9 (4), pp. 293-315; Andersson, L.M., Bateman, T.S., Cynicism in the workplace: Some causes and effects (1997) Journal of Organizational Behavior, pp. 449-469; Arthur, W., (2007) The authentic enterprise: An Arthur W.

Thus, this study poses the question of how HEIs’ identity and image through strategic communication influence parents of prospective students. We examined this question by conducting a web-based experiment with 314 United States (U.S.) parents of prospective college students. We explored their perceptions of university identity and image as their supportive condition based on the theoretical argument of relational reputation management. Although the results show that parents perceive both identity and image as important assets for HEIs, establishing a strong identity is critical to enhancing their perceptions of and behavioral intentions toward a university. The findings contribute to understudied strategic communication research assessing parents’ informational and cognitive processes toward HEI reputation and reveal how HEIs can build their strategic communication directions. © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Aaker, D.A., Shansby, J.G., Positioning your product (1982) Business Horizons, 25 (3), pp. 56-62; Alessandri, S.W., Yang, S., Kinsey, D.F., An integrative approach to university visual identity and reputation (2006) Corporate Reputation Review, 9 (4), pp. 258-270; Alves, H., Raposo, M., The influence of university image on student behaviour (2010) International Journal of Educational Management, 24 (1), pp. 73-85; Andreassen, T., Lindestad, B., Cutomer loyalty and complex services: The impact of corporate image on quality, customer satisfaction and loyalty for customers with varying degrees of service expertise (1998) Internatinal Journal of Service Industry Management, 9, pp. 7-23; Arnett, D.B., German, S.D., Hunt, S.D., The identity salience model of relationship marketing success: The case of nonprofit marketing (2003) Journal of Marketing, 67 (April), pp. 89-105; Balmer, J., Soenen, B., The acid test of corporate identity management (1999) Journal of Marketing Management, 15 (1-3), pp. 69-92; Baltaru, R., Do non-academic professionals enhance universities’ performance?

Through a quantitative online survey of 396 WeChat users in China, randomly selected via an international sampling firm and a structural equation modeling analysis, the results show that publics’ political discussion about Xi on social media in China significantly influences the perceived leadership effectiveness of the president. Specifically, the more the publics engage in positive discussion about the president on social media, the more they perceive him to be a better political leader, and vice-versa. The president’s leadership communication attributes of responsiveness and authenticity strongly and positively influenced perceived leadership effectiveness and the quality of government-public relationships. Publics’ evaluation of the president’s leadership effectiveness directly contributed to public trust and satisfaction toward the government. The theoretical and practical implications of the study are discussed. © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Aaldering, L., Vliegenthart, R., Political leaders and the media.

In media catching, journalists working on specific stories reach out to large numbers of public relations practitioners using a variety of technologically aided services with queries for specific information. Using quantitative and qualitative content analyses, this study examines journalist queries submitted through a media request service, Pressfeed.ru, to understand the dynamics of the media-catching trend in Russia. Findings show a substantial gap between reporters’ expectations and public relations professionals’ goals and abilities, and a fragmentation of media outlets’ practices. The findings also revealed similarities in the growth and usage patterns of the Russian service to the first American media-catching service, Help-a-Reporter-Out. An empirical investigation is warranted to test an emergent model of the mutual influences of reporters, public relations specialists, internal (organizational values) and external (societal culture, political climate) factors during the process of media catching across different cultures and countries. © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Agresti, A., (2002) Categorical data analysis, , 2nd ed., New York, NY: John Wiley and Sons; Bentele, G., Nothhaft, H., Zerfass, A., Van Ruler, B., Sriramesh, K., The intereffication model: Theoretical discussions and empirical research (2008) Public relations research: European and international perspectives and innovations, , Wiesbaden, Germany: VS Verlag für Sozialwissenschaften, &,.

Likewise, scholarly research has focused more on specific parts of strategic planning, such as message—and channel-level communication in social media, but little research has been done to understand program-level communication planning. The purpose of this study was to examine the confluence of current trends in social media use with strategic communication processes through in-depth interviews and a national survey of public relations practitioners. The in-depth interviews revealed two overarching themes: (1) social media use should be guided by strategic planning and (2) social media tactics should revolve around conversations. The survey results showed that practitioners are involved in social media strategy development and tactical implementation, yet see their involvement as linked mostly to their organizations’ strategic rather than tactical social media activities. In addition, practitioners delineate social media strategies and tactics differently than theoretical conceptualizations. © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"(2011) Alterian’s eighth annual survey: How engaged is your brand?, , http://www.alterian.com/resources/research/Alterian-Annual-Survey-Results-2010, Retrieved from; Atkin, C.K., Rice, R.E., Valdiva, A.N., Advances in public communication campaigns (2013) The international encyclopedia of media studies, , Oxford, UK: Blackwell Publishing, &,.

The findings validate the model and display strongly perceived “authenticity” in each case study, strengthening the reliability of the CEO brand. The study clearly shows that each of these successful CEO brands has: a clear brand identity, built on the alignment of its human identity and its managerial identity; a strong CEO brand reputation, built on its human reputation and aligned managerial reputation; clear congruence between the CEO brand identity and reputation, producing a distinct, differentiating CEO brand positioning leading to CEO brand equity. These findings, along with stakeholders’ internalization of CEO Brand Reputation values, produce stakeholder positive perceptions of the company—largely through the central role of the business media in the process of CEO branding. Surprisingly, none of these founder CEOs had any prior intention of creating a CEO brand. This study also offers a clear, detailed replication methodology for studying other types of CEOs, in other countries/cultures. © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Aaker, D.A., Measuring brand equity across products and markets (1996) California Management Review, 38 (3), pp. 102-120; Aaker, D.A., (2003) Building strong brands, , New York, NY: The Free Press; Argenti, P.A., Druckenmiller, B., Reputation and the corporate brand (2004) Corporate Reputation Review, 6 (4), pp. 368-374; Arruda, W., Dixson, K., (2007) Build your brand in bits and bytes, , http://changethis.com/manifesto/40.04.BuildYourBrand/pdf/40.04.BuildYourBrand, Retrieved from; Bendisch, F., Larsen, G., Trueman, M., (2007) Branding people: Towards a conceptual framework, , Bradford, UK: Bradford University of Management; Bendisch, F., Larsen, G., Trueman, M., Fame and fortune: A conceptual model of CEO brands (2013) European Journal of Marketing, 47 (3-4), pp. 596-614; Blackett, T., (2003) What is a brand?

Although studies have identified a lack of standards and a narrow focus on “activities” and “outputs” in traditional evaluation models and literature, a two-year international study, which examined a number of recently developed evaluation frameworks and models and accompanying implementation guidelines, identifies several new concepts and dimensions in evaluation, along with some remaining gaps for further research. Based on content analysis of evaluation literature, interviews, and ethnography, this article reports four key findings of recent research and explains how these can contribute to theory-building and practice to transform the planning, implementation, and evaluation of public relations and corporate, government, organizational and marketing communication. © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"(2010) Barcelona declaration of measurement principles, , http://amecorg.com/2012/06/barcelona-declaration-of-measurement-principles, London, UK: Author, Retrieved from; (2015) Barcelona principles 2.0., , http://amecorg.com/barcelona-principles-2-0, London, UK: Author, Retrieved from; (2017) AMEC integrated evaluation framework, , https://amecorg.com/amecframework, London, UK: Author, Retrieved from; Anderson, A., (2005) The community builder’s approach to theory of change: A practical guide to theory and development, , New York, NY: The Aspen Institute Roundtable on Community Change; Bartholomew, D., Chen, Z., (2016) Metrics man: It doesn’t count unless you can count, , New York, NY: Business Expert Press, Ed; Bauman, A., Nutbeam, D., (2014) Evaluation in a nutshell: A practical guide to the evaluation of health promotion programs, , 2nd ed., North Ryde, NSW: McGraw-Hill; (2016) Realist evaluation [Web site], , http://betterevaluation.org/approach/realist_evaluation, Melbourne, Vic: Author, Retrieved from; Bickman, L., Using program theory to describe and measure program quality (1990) New Directions for Evaluation, 47, pp. 61-72; Broom, G., (2009) Cutlip & Center’s effective public relations, , 10th ed., Upper Saddle River, NJ: Pearson; Chen, H., Rossi, P., Evaluating with sense: The theory-driven approach (1983) Evaluation Review, 7 (3), pp. 283-302; Clark, H., (2004) Deciding the scope of a theory of change, , New York, NY: ActKnowledge; Clark, H., Taplin, D., (2012) Theory of change basics: A primer on theory of change, , New York, NY: Actknowledge; (2017) New South Wales government evaluation framework for advertising and communication, , Sydney, NSW: Author; (2016) Worldwide ad spending growth revised downward [Web site], , http://www.emarketer.com/Article/Worldwide-Ad-Spending-Growth-Revised-Downward/1013858, April, Retrieved from; (2015) Better regulation guidelines, , http://ec.europa.eu/smart-regulation/guidelines/toc_guide_en.htm, Brussels, Belgium: Author, Retrieved from; (2015) Toolkit for the evaluation of communication activities, , http://ec.europa.eu/dgs/communication/about/evaluation/documents/communication-evaluation-toolkit_en.pdf, Brussels, Belgium: Author, Retrieved from; (2015) External communication network code of conduct on measurement and evaluation of communication activities, , Brussels, Belgium: Author; (2015) Synergies and efficiencies review: Report from the Working Group on External and Internal Communication., , November, Brussels, Belgium: Author, Have corrected bib type to Book from Other to match the preceding three same entries.

Company-cause fit has been incorporated as a strategic tool in marketing and advertising, yet transparency has been primarily discussed in terms of its ethical implications in PR literature. Most significantly, this study suggests a moderating role of transparency on the effect of CSR cause fit, in that partnering with an incongruent cause fit can help build trust with consumers when the CSR message is communicated in a highly transparent manner. Furthermore, this study suggests that transparency is a necessary condition to be strategically implemented in CSR communication to enhance trust with consumers. © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Ahn, S., Kim, H., Forney, J.A., Co-marketing alliances between heterogeneous industries: Examining perceived match-up effects in product, brand and alliance levels (2009) Journal of Retailing and Consumer Services, 16 (6), pp. 477-485; Albu, O.B., Wehmeier, S., Organizational transparency and sense-making: The case of Northern Rock (2014) Journal of Public Relations Research, 26 (2), pp. 117-133; Andrews, K., Can best corporations be made moral (1973) Harvard Business Review, 51 (3), pp. 57-64; Auger, G.A., Trust me, trust me not: An experimental analysis of the effect of transparency on organizations (2014) Journal of Public Relations Research, 26 (4), pp. 325-343; Balkin, J.M., How mass media simulate political transparency (1999) Cultural Values, 3 (4), pp. 393-413; Bartlett, J.L., Public relations and corporate social responsibility (2014) The handbook of communication and corporate social responsibility, pp. 67-86. , Ihlen O., Bartlett J.L., May S., (eds), Oxford, UK: Wiley-Blackwell,.

In this study, we conducted 42 in-depth interviews with advertising and public relations practitioners in the United States and mainland China to explore how emerging media and integrated marketing communication (IMC) are impacting advertising and public relations agencies in the two countries. This cross-cultural comparison revealed several critical insights, which were examined through the lenses of IMC and dimensions of culture. We found that emerging media lead to converging trends in various aspects of agency performance. The blurring of paid, earned, shared, and owned media (PESO) was evidentially observed in how executives of both countries defined and used media. Chinese agencies were media agnostic, concerned more with effectiveness of media practices. The U.S. agencies embraced collaboration and information technology better compared to their Chinese peers. This research contributes to the body of knowledge in strategic communication via providing empirical evidence of how Chinese and U.S. agencies coordinate IMC and perceive PESO media relative and in response to emerging media practices. © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"(1999) Ad age advertising century: Timeline, , http://adage.com/article/special-report-the-advertising-century/ad-age-advertising-century-timeline/143661/, Retrieved from; Bantel, K.A., Technology-based, “adolescent” firm configurations: Strategy identification, context, and performance (1998) Journal of Business Venturing, 13 (3), pp. 205-230; Batra, R., Keller, K.L., Integrating marketing communications: New findings, new lessons, and new ideas (2016) Journal of Marketing, 80, pp. 122-145. , November; Bayles, S., Hall, S., What value does paid media hold for the PR industry?

Dominance of such emotions, and the corresponding appraisal style, very often threaten societal security. Emotionally Based Strategic Communications (EBSC), proposed in this article, can be used as a communications strategy for mitigating negative and promoting positive emotions within societal groups exposed to radicalization processes. Essentially, EBSC as mechanisms of positive emotional regulation strategy are based on reshaping the (re)appraisal style of radicalized groups. Grounded in the appraisal theories of emotions, EBSC are entirely non-coercive, and applicable to a wide variety of groups. Such communications strategies are also extendible to Internet-based social media networks, opening new possibilities in deradicalization processes using sentiment analysis, cognitive computing, botnets and other ICT-based methods and techniques. © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Abraham-Dowsing, K., Godfrey, A., Khor, Z., Reframing the evidence debates: A view from the media for development sector (2014) Working paper, , http://downloads.bbc.co.uk/rmhttp/mediaaction/pdf/research/working_paper_reframing_the_evidence_debates.pdf, London, UK: BBC Media Action, Retrieved, from; Abubakar, I., (2016) Effective strategic communication in countering radicalism in Indonesia, , http://apcss.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Countering-radicalism-2016.pdf, Honolulu, HI: Asia-Pacific Center for Security Studies, Retrieved, from; Aggarwal, N.K., Cedeño, K., Bhui, K., The role of psychiatrists in countering violent extremism (2017) Psychiatric Times, 34 (2). , http://www.psychiatrictimes.com/special-reports/role-psychiatrists-countering-violent-extremism, Retrieved, from; Al Raffie, D., Whose hearts and minds?

It applies Symbolic Convergence Theory (SCT) and Fantasy Theme Analysis (FTA), aiming to provide a new operational method for textual analysis of Macau city branding. It examines fantasy themes embodied in media reports, blog articles and promotion materials, which were collected from three media types, namely earned media, shared media and owned media. Then the symbolic realities in varied media are compared. This research has identified 11 fantasy themes that have nongaming elements. We found the symbolic pictures of Macau represented in various media types to be different. The rhetoric of the themes was just flowing on the surface of the senses, and hardly ignites a deeper and enduring emotion for brand recognition. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Alemán, M.W., Embracing and resisting romantic fantasies as the rhetorical vision on a senior net discussion board (2005) Journal of Communication, 55, pp. 5-21; Basney, B., Brands as publishers: Using content and paid media to fuel a brand transformation (2014) Journal of Brand Strategy, 3 (2), pp. 101-110; Bormann, E.G., Fantasy and rhetorical vision: The rhetorical criticism of social reality (1972) Quarterly Journal of Speech, 58, pp. 396-407; Bormann, E.G., The symbolic convergence theory of communication: Applications and implications for teachers and consultants (1982) Journal of Applied Communication Research, 10 (1), pp. 50-51; Bormann, E.G., Symbolic convergence theory: A communication formulation (1985) The Journal of Communication, 35 (1), pp. 128-138; Bormann, E.G., (2000) The force of fantasy: restoring the American Dream, , Carbondale, IL: SIU Press; Bormann, E.G., Cragan, J.F., Shields, D.C., Defending symbolic convergence theory from an imaginary Gunn (2003) Quarterly Journal of Speech, 89 (4), pp. 366-372; Burcher, N., (2012) Facebook usage statistics by country, Dec. 2008–Dec. 2011, , http://www.nickburcher.com/2012/01/facebook-usage-statistics-by-country.html; Cai, L.A., Cooperative branding for rural destinations (2002) Annals of Tourism, 29; Cheng, C., (1999) Macau: a cultural Janus, , Hong Kong, China: Hong Kong University Press; Cheng, L.K.P., Taylor, J.L., Branding of former Soviet cities: The case of Almaty (2007) The ICFAI University Journal of Brand Management, 4 (4), pp. 7-13; Cragan, J.F., Shields, D.C., The use of symbolic convergence theory in corporate strategic planning: A case study (1992) Journal of Applied Communication Research, 20 (2), pp. 199-218; De Carlo, M., Canali, S., Pritchard, A., Morgan, N., Moving Milan towards Expo: Designing culture into a city brand (2009) Journal of Place Management and Development, 2 (1), pp. 8-22; De Chernatony, L., Brand Management through narrowing the gap between brand identity and brand reputation (1999) Journal of Marketing Management, 15 (1-3), pp. 157-179; Foss, K.A., Littlejohn, S.W., The day after: Rhetorical vision in an ironic frame (1986) Critical Studies in Media Communication, 3 (3), pp. 317-336; Foss, S.K., Framing the study of visual rhetoric: Toward a transformation of rhetorical theory (2004) In C.

Specifically, we believe that trust in government’s ability, benevolence and integrity matter more to contact-type political participation under a high level of perceived dialogic propinquity than under a low level. We use PROCESS to analyze third wave data from the Asian Barometer Survey to understand these moderation effects. Based upon the data from 3,472 mainland Chinese citizens, the results show that the more citizens trust their government’s ability, the higher their willingness to conduct contact-type participation under conditions of high perceived dialogic propinquity. Under conditions of low perceived dialogic propinquity, however, trust in government’s ability has no predictive effect on citizens’ willingness to participate in contact-type political activities. Moreover, compared with the dimension of trust in government’s ability, perceived dialogic propinquity fails to moderate the relationships between trust in government’s benevolence and integrity, and contact-type political participation. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Aberbach, M.D., Busch, R.J., Political competence, political trust, and the action orientations of university students (1975) The Journal of Politics, 37 (1), pp. 57-82; Abramson, P.R., Aldrich, J.H., Rohde, D.W., (1995) Change and continuity in the 1992 elections, , Washington, DC: Congressional Quarterly; Aiken, L.S., West, S.C., (1991) Multiple regression: Testing and interpreting interactions, , Newbury Park, CA: Sage; Avidar, R., The responsiveness pyramid: Embedding responsiveness and interactivity into public relations theory (2013) Public Relations Review, 39 (5), pp. 440-450; Tiger in the net (2014) The Economist, , https://www.economist.com/news/china/21636086-zhou-yongkang-may-well-have-been-corrupt-his-real-problem-was-losing-power-struggle-tiger, December, Retrieved from; Beck, U., From industrial society to the risk society: Questions of survival, social structure and ecological enlightenment (1992) Theory, Culture and Society, 9 (1), pp. 97-123; Bélanger, É., Nadeau, R., Political trust and the vote in multiparty elections: The Canadian case (2005) European Journal of Political Research, 44 (1), pp. 121-146; Berko, R.M., Rosenfeld, L.B., Samovar, L.A., (1997) Connecting: A culture-sensitive approach to interpersonal communication competency, , 2nd ed., Fort Worth, TX: Harcourt Brace; Brandtzæg, P.B., Heim, J., Why people use social networking sites (2009) Paper presented at the Proceedings of the HCI International 2009, San Diego, pp. 143-152. , July, Berlin, Heidelberg: Springer Verlag; Bratton, M., Political participation in a new democracy institutional considerations from Zambia (1999) Comparative Political Studies, 32 (5), pp. 549-588; Cai, Y., Managed participation in China (2004) Political Science Quarterly, 119 (3), pp. 425-451; Cai, Y., Local governments and the suppression of popular resistance in China (2008) The China Quarterly, 193, pp. 24-42; Caldwell, C., Clapham, S.E., Organizational trustworthiness: An international perspective (2003) Journal of Business Ethics, 47 (4), pp. 349-364; Cale, G., Shifting the ultimatum: Political alienation and participation (Master thesis) (2014) Retrieved from, , http://uknowledge.uky.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1017&context=sociology_etds; Callison, C., Seltzer, T., Influence of responsiveness, accessibility, and professionalism on journalists’ perceptions of Southwest Airlines public relations (2010) Public Relations Review, 36 (2), pp. 141-146; Catterberg, G., Moreno, A., The individual bases of political trust: Trends in new and established democracies (2006) International Journal of Public Opinion Research, 18 (1), pp. 31-48; Chang, E.C., Chu, Y.H., Corruption and trust: Exceptionalism in Asian democracies (2006) The Journal of Politics, 68 (2), pp. 259-271; Chen, J., Pan, J., Xu, Y., Sources of authoritarian responsiveness: A field experiment in china (2015) American Journal of Political Science, 60 (2), pp. 383-400; Citrin, J., Comment: The political relevance of trust in government (1974) American Political Science Review, 68 (3), pp. 973-988; Citrin, J., Luks, S., Political trust revisited: Déjà Vu all over again (2001) What is it about government that Americans dislike?, , Hibbing J.R., Theiss-Morse E., (eds), Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press, &,.

Crisis communication is viewed as a form of strategic communication, involving multiple stakeholders in situations that are dependent on context, space and time. This approach provides a much-needed path for investigating and understanding crisis communication practices in contemporary China. The distinct Chinese context for crisis communication, with both an authoritarian government structure and a digital transformation of society, challenges theories originally developed in the Western countries. To address this issue, this study proposes a three-theme analytical framework to examine crisis communication practices in the Chinese context: (1) an audience (or stakeholder) orientation—focusing sense-making, (2) a proactive and interactive approach—focusing communication, and (3) a community—focused approach—focusing a long-range precrisis perspective. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Abolafia, M.Y., Kilduff, M., Enacting market crisis: The social construction of a speculative bubble (1988) Administrative Science Quarterly, 33 (2), pp. 177-193; Alfonso, G., Suzanne, S., Crisis communications management on the web: How Internet-based technologies are changing the way public relations professionals handle business crises (2008) Journal of Contingencies and Crisis Management, 16 (3), pp. 143-153; Allen, M.W., Caillouet, R.H., Legitimation endeavors: Impression management strategies used by an organization in crisis (1994) Communication Monographs, 61 (1), pp. 44-62; Austin, J.L., (1962) How to do things with words, , Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press; Avery, E.J., Lariscy, R.W., Kim, S., Hocked, T., A quantitative review of crisis communication research in public relations from 1991 to 2009 (2010) Public Relations Review, 36 (2), pp. 190-192; (2013) China “smiling official” Yang Dacai jailed for 14 years, , http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china–23956170, Retrieved February 17, 2017, from; Bechler, C., Reframing the organizational exigency: Taking a new approach in crisis research (2004) Responding to crisis: A rhetorical approach to crisis communication, , Millar D.P., Heath R.L., (eds), London, UK: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates,.

Although the field has burgeoned enormously over the past two decades, there has been little discussion about what comprises an excellent comparative study, and little is known about the state-of-the-art of comparative research in the field of strategic communication. This article suggests a set of general scientific criteria for solid comparative research and applies these to assess the quality of comparative studies in strategic communication. Based on an analysis of 75 studies located through a systematic search in 16 journals, this article sketches the contours of a fast-emerging research field, which is increasingly driven by European and Asian scholars. The results identify common deficiencies and indicate that the potential of comparative research to contextualize and explain strategic communication in different countries has not yet been fully exploited. Future directions for engaging in more advanced comparative strategic communication research are given. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"An, S.-K., Park, D.-J., Cho, S., Berger, B., A cross-cultural study of effective organizational crisis response strategy in the United States and South Korea (2010) International Journal of Strategic Communication, 4 (4), pp. 225-243; Bardhan, N., Weaver, C.K., Introduction (2011) Public relations in global cultural contexts.

Eighty-one in-depth interviews with Chinese and South Korean millennials showed that they perceived postcrisis CSR positively even when they perceived an underlying self-serving motive. The interview data also revealed that postcrisis CSR initiatives relevant to the company’s business (CSR fit) and to the crisis at hand were more effective in both countries than the other CSR initiatives. Millennials in both countries valued CSR’s impact (benefiting the society as a whole), continuity (being long-term planned and sustainable), uniqueness (with few precedents), and transparency (fully disclosing detailed information) when evaluating various postcrisis CSR initiatives. Controllability (CSR being under full control of a company) was a significant criterion for South Korean millennials only. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Aguinis, H., Glavas, A., What we know and don’t know about corporate social responsibility: A review and research agenda (2012) Journal of Management, 38 (4), pp. 932-968; Aguinis, H., Glavas, A., Embedded versus peripheral corporate social responsibility: Psychological foundations (2012) Industrial and Organizational Psychology, 6 (4), pp. 314-332; Ailawadi, K.L., Neslin, S.A., Luan, Y.J., Taylor, G.A., Does retailer CSR enhance behavioral loyalty?

The current debate, however, neglects the fact that Europe, in the past, has already experienced attacks from terrorist groups that were accompanied by sophisticated public relations and propaganda, their motives, however, being social-revolutionary, not religious. Therefore, this article elaborates to what extent the Red Army Faction applied strategic communication in order to achieve its (political) goals. Theoretical considerations about the concepts of terrorism as propaganda of the deed, terrorism as a media event and Fourth Generation Warfare precede the case study. An important finding is that even though the RAF was indeed a very media-savvy group at the time, this savviness did not help them to achieve their long-term goal of political revolution. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Abich, H., (1984) Der Fall Lorenz: Das Fernsehen in der Rolle des genötigten Nothelfers, , Stuttgart, Germany:: Süddeutscher Rundfunk; Aust, S., (2010) Der Baader-Meinhof-Komplex, , München, Germany:: Wilhelm Goldmann Verlag; Benton, M.A.J., LeRoy, D., (2008) Fourth Generation Warfare: The need for a comprehensive approach, , Fort Leavenworth, KS: School of Advanced Military Studies; Bermes, J., (1991) Der Streit um die Presse-Selbstkontrolle: Der Deutsche Presserat.

This study analyzed strategic leadership communication fostering such coordination in a network consisting of 24 members representing a variety of authorities, organizations and units established during a large forest fire in Sweden. As the crisis unfolded over a two-week period, 10 network meetings were observed and audio recorded. Discourse analysis was employed to analyze network leaders’ and members’ communication during the meetings. Findings illustrate that leadership communication strategies that fostered networked coordination of organizations’ crisis communication differ in significant ways from leadership communication in noncrisis and team contexts. Salient leadership communication strategies of directing/structuring and encouraging/facilitating were employed during crisis network meetings and functioned to coordinate involved organizations’ crisis communication efforts during time pressure. The study contributes with new knowledge of strategic leadership communication for crisis network coordination, which is important to crisis management and can be used in crisis preparation to enhance resilience. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Adkins, G.L., Organizational networks in disaster response: An examination of the US Government network’s efforts in Hurricane Katrina (2010) The handbook of crisis communication, , Coombs W.T., Holladay S.H., (eds), Malden, MA: Wiley-Blackwell,.

Intelligence services operate in the dark, as far away as possible from the attention of the media and the public. However, in the new media age, intelligence services face a fresh set of unfamiliar challenges, including a dramatic change in the concept of time, the presence of alternative voices in the new media and a dramatic reduction in the ability to manage and control information. Using a case study approach, three traditional methods employed by Israeli intelligence services when addressing situations of exposure are examined: censorship, gag orders and the Editors’ Committee. The study addresses the organizations’ dilemmas, choices and difficulties in adjusting to the new media environment. On a broader theoretical level, the research demonstrates the importance of recognizing the differences among the diverse actors in the field of strategic communication as manifested within the well-established concepts of strategic communication, adaptation and adjustment. Since the field of strategic communication aims to include so many types of organizations and actors, it is crucial that nuances and differences among them are identified and analyzed within their specific context. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Aldrich, R.J., Regulation by revelation?

Reflecting the prevailing trend of nationalism around the globe, the study findings highlight the power of consumer nationalism on driving the effects of these culture-oriented positioning strategies. Furthermore, self-brand connection was found to be a critical mediator of the effects of consumer nationalism on brand evaluation. Based on the findings, this study provides strategic guidelines for both domestic and global brands to craft culturally relevant campaigns that capitalize on the growing trend of consumer nationalism in transitioning markets such as China. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Aaker, J.L., Brumbaugh, A.M., Grier, S.A., Nontarget markets and viewer distinctiveness: The impact of target marketing on advertising attitudes (2000) Journal of Consumer Psychology, 9, pp. 127-140; Alden, D.L., Steenkamp, J.B.E., Batra, R., Brand positioning through advertising in Asia, North America, and Europe: The role of global consumer culture (1999) The Journal of Marketing, 63 (1), pp. 75-87; Alden, D.L., Steenkamp, J.B.E., Batra, R., Consumer attitudes toward marketplace globalization: Structure, antecedents and consequences (2006) International Journal of Research in Marketing, 23, pp. 227-239; Arnett, J.J., The psychology of globalization (2002) American Psychologist, 57, pp. 774-783; Babayi, M., Rahmani, Z., The role of localization strategy in development of brand equity: A case study of Samsung firm (2015) Management Science Letters, 5, pp. 443-446; Balabanis, G., Diamantopoulos, A., Brand origin identification by consumers: A classification perspective (2008) Journal of International Marketing, 16 (1), pp. 39-71; Balabanis, G., Diamantopoulos, A., Mueller, R.D., Melewar, T.C., The impact of nationalism, patriotism and internationalism on consumer ethnocentric tendencies (2001) Journal of International Business Studies, 32, pp. 157-175; Baradat, L.P., (2015) Political ideologies, , New York, NY: Routledge; Belk, R.W., Hyperreality and globalization: Culture in the age of Ronald McDonald (1996) Journal of International Consumer Marketing, 8 (3-4), pp. 23-37; Billings, A.C., Brown, N.A., Brown, K.A., Guo, Q., Leeman, M.A., Ličen, S., Rowe, D., From pride to smugness and the nationalism between: Olympic media consumption effects on nationalism across the globe (2013) Mass Communication and Society, 16 (6), pp. 910-932; Blank, T., Schmidt, P., National identity in a united Germany: Nationalism or patriotism?

By using well-established theoretical approaches of communication research, such as the influence of presumed influence approach, this study sought to determine the extent to which the subjective perceptions of German political communication practitioners explain their professional social media activities. The results of a survey (N = 1,067) indicate that the more political communication practitioners perceived that other political communication practitioners used and were influenced by Facebook and Twitter, the more often they used social media themselves. In contrast, the presumed reach of Facebook and Twitter among politicians, journalists, and citizens, as well as the presumed influence of both media on these groups, were not related to the practitioners’ social media activities. These findings suggest that the practitioners’ social media activities are driven more by an in-group orientation toward their colleagues and less by a strategic orientation toward external stakeholders. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,"Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG

We conducted an online experiment (N = 445) with a 2 (duration of partnership: long-term vs. short-term) × 4 (response strategy: denial, ending partnership, continuing partnership, vs. no response) between-subject design, with two no-crisis control groups. The results confirmed the existence of negative spillover effects; when respondents were exposed to crisis information about a partner organization, their attitude toward the principal organization became less favorable. We found that, regardless of the partnership’s duration, announcing a decision about the partnership—either ending the partnership or continuing the partnership—was not effective in restoring the principal organization’s image. Denial strategies, however, significantly improved the image of the principal organization, up to its precrisis level. We discuss the practical and theoretical implications. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Aaker, D.A., Joachimsthaler, E., The brand relationship spectrum: The key to the brand architecture challenge (2000) California Management Review, 42 (4), pp. 8-23; Aaker, J., Vohs, K.D., Mogilner, C., Nonprofits are seen as warm and for-profits as competent: Firm stereotypes matter (2010) Journal of Consumer Research, 37, pp. 224-237; Ahluwalia, R., Burnkrant, R.E., Unnava, H.R., Consumer response to negative publicity: The moderating role of commitment (2000) Journal of Marketing Research, 38 (2), pp. 203-214; Ahluwalia, R., Unnava, H.R., Burnkrant, R.E., The moderating role of commitment on the spillover effect of marketing communications (2001) Journal of Marketing Research, 38 (4), pp. 458-470; Anderson, J.R., A spreading activation theory of memory (1983) Journal of Verbal Learning and Verbal Behavior, 22, pp. 261-295; Anderson, J.R., Bower, G.H., A propositional theory of recognition memory (1974) Memory & Cognition, 2 (3), pp. 406-412; Anderson, M.C., Neely, J.H., Interference and inhibition in memory retrieval (1996) Memory, , Bjork E.L., Bjork R.A., (eds), New York, NY: Academic Press; Bae, J., Cameron, G.T., Conditioning effect of prior reputation on perception of corporate giving (2006) Public Relations Review, 32, pp. 144-150; Balachander, S., Ghose, S., Reciprocal spillover effects: A strategic benefit of brand extensions (2003) Journal of Marketing, 67 (1), pp. 4-13; Baur, D., Schmitz, H.P., Corporations and NGOs: When accountability leads to co-optation (2012) Journal of Business Ethics, 106, pp. 9-21; Berinsky, A.J., Huber, G.A., Lenz, G.S., Evaluating online labor markets for experimental research: Amazon.com’s Mechanical Turk (2012) Political Analysis, 20 (3), pp. 351-368; Bhattacharya, C.B., Sen, S., Consumer-Company identification: A framework for understanding consumers’ relationships with companies (2003) Journal of Marketing, 67, pp. 76-77; Bowen, S.A., What communication professionals tell us regarding dominant coalition access and gaining membership (2009) Journal of Applied Communication Research, 37 (4), pp. 418-443; Buhrmester, M., Kwang, T., Gosling, S.D., Amazon’s Mechanical Turk: A new source of inexpensive, yet high-quality data?

The challenge is to understand the multiple goals and dimensions of the field, to acknowledge the principle of recursivity in all communicative practices, and to approach the individual not as a solitary mind, but a social being whose drives and proclivities are always socially and culturally mediated. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Berger, P.L., Luckmann, T., (1966) The social construction of reality.

The theoretical foundation used was an adaption of neo-institutional theory for strategic communication. The sample was an issue of Dabiq, an online propaganda magazine, from the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL). The qualitative method employed was ethnographic content analysis. The study found ISIL used Dabiq as a form of strategic communication to achieve organizational goals in compliance with neo-institutional theory. Furthermore, ISIL used strategic communication in a similar manner as nonextremist groups; it sought to advance its organization as being superior to rival ones. These findings indicate that neo-institutional theory can further understanding of how extremist groups use propaganda, as strategic communication, to achieve organizational goals. This is accomplished by analyzing the functions specified in neo-institutional theory that propagandists attempt to fulfill. In general, this study offers evidence that the academic field of strategic communication offers significant potential to advance propaganda theory. If neo-institutional theory, as adapted for strategic communication, can explain and predict what a propagandist does, other strategic communication perspectives might offer the same ability to analyze propaganda and develop propaganda theory. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Ali, A., Assimilation, integration or convivencia: The dilemma of diaspora Muslims from “Eurabia” to “Londonistan”, from “Lakembanon” to Sri Lanka (2010) Journal of Muslim Minority Affairs, 30 (2), pp. 183-198; Altheide, D.L., Johnson, J.M., Reflections on interpretive adequacy in qualitative research (2011) The Sage handbook of qualitative research, , Denzin N.K., Lincoln Y.S., (eds), 4th ed., Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage; Altheide, D.L., Schneider, C.J., (2013) Qualitative media analysis, , Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage; Archetti, C., (2013) Understanding terrorism in the age of global media.

Findings suggest that generating awareness, along with information sharing and word-of-mouth, cultivating long-term relationships, developing new businesses, and building image and reputation, are the primary purposes for stakeholder engagement. Thought leadership building, co-branding, and influencer endorsement were identified as new social media engagement strategies for startups.

Using in-depth interviews, it investigates the perceptions of mothers about the Maggi noodles lead crisis in India. The findings reveal three types of customers—the devotees, doubters and dropouts—who had different perceptions about the crisis and attributed different levels of responsibility to the corporation based on their attitude and affect toward the brand, attitude toward the corporation, attitude toward the regulatory institution, and levels of nationalism. The study recommends that corporate response strategies during a crisis should focus on the “customer type” and not just the “crisis type” in order to be effective. The theoretical implication and managerial implications for crisis and strategic communication are discussed. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Avery, E.J., Contextual and audience moderators of channel selection and message reception of public health information in routine and crisis situations (2010) Journal of Public Relations Research, 22 (4), pp. 378-403; Avery, E.J., Lariscy, R.W., Kim, S., Hocke, T., A quantitative review of crisis communication research in public relations from 1991 to 2009 (2010) Public Relations Review, 36 (2), pp. 190-192; Avraham, E., Crisis communication, image restoration, and battling stereotypes of terror and wars: Media strategies for attracting tourism to Middle Eastern countries (2013) American Behavioral Scientist, 57 (9), pp. 1350-1367; Bapna, A., Irani, D., Most trusted brands 2015: Earning the mother’s trust is Maggi’s key to survival and success (2015) The Economic Times, , http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2015-11-25/news/68560959_1_maggi-consumer-trust-brand-survey, November, Retrieved from; Benoit, W.L., (1995) Account, excuses, and apologies: A theory of image restoration strategies, , Albany, NY: State University of New York; Benoit, W.L., Image repair discourse and crisis communication (1997) Public Relations Review, 23 (2), pp. 177-186; Benoit, W.L., President Barack Obama’s image repair on HealthCare.gov (2014) Public Relations Review, 40 (5), pp. 733-738; Benoit, W.L., (2015) Account, excuses, and apologies: A theory of image restoration strategies, , Albany, NY: State University of New York; Benoit, W.L., Czerwinski, A., A critical analysis of USAir’s image repair discourse (1997) Business Communication Quarterly, 60 (3), pp. 38-57; Benoit, W.L., Lindsey, J., Argument strategies: Antidote to Tylenol’s poisoned image (1987) Journal of the American Forensic Association, 22 (3), pp. 136-146; Benoit, W.L., Pang, A., Crisis communication and image repair discourse (2008) Public relations: From theory to practice, pp. 244-261. , Hansen-Horn T.L., Neff B.D., (eds), Boston, MA: Pearson; Bhattacharjee, N., Nestlé argues against “arbitrary” Maggi ban in court (2015) Reuters, , http://www.reuters.com/article/india-nestle-idUSKBN0OS18Q20150612, June, Retrieved from; Blumer, H., (1969) Symbolic interactionism: Perspective and method, , Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice-Hall; Byun, K., Dass, M., An investigation of the effects of product recalls on brand commitment and purchase intention (2015) The Journal of Consumer Marketing, 32 (1), pp. 1-14; Charmaz, K., (2006) Constructing grounded theory: A practical guide through qualitative analysis, , London, UK: Sage; Chatterjee, P., FSSAI orders Nestlé to take all 9 Maggi Noodle variants off the shelves (2015) The Indian Express, , http://indianexpress.com/article/india/central-food-safety-regulator-fssai-orders-nestle-to-recall-9-maggi-noodle-variants-from-india/, June, Retrieved from; Coombs, W.T., The development of guidelines for the selection of the “appropriate” crisis-response strategies (1995) Management Communication Quarterly, 8 (4), pp. 447-476; Coombs, W.T., Protecting organization reputations during a crisis: The development and application of situational crisis communication theory (2007) Corporate Reputation Review, 10 (3), pp. 163-176; Coombs, W.T., Holladay, S.J., Communication and attributions in a crisis: An experiment study in crises communication (1996) Journal of Public Relations Research, 8 (4), pp. 279-295; Coombs, W.T., Holladay, S.J., Comparing apology to equivalent crisis response strategies: Clarifying apology’s role and value in crisis communication (2008) Public Relations Review, 34 (3), pp. 252-257; Creswell, J., (1998) Qualitative inquiry and research design: Choosing among five traditions, , Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage; Dardis, F.E., Haigh, M.M., Prescribing versus describing: Testing image-restoration strategies in a crisis situation (2009) Corporate Communications: An International Journal, 14 (1), pp. 101-118; Dawar, N., Pillutla, M.M., Impact of product-harm crises on brand equity: The moderating role of consumer expectations (2000) Journal of Marketing Research, 37, pp. 215-226; Dean, D.H., Consumer reaction to negative publicity: Effects of corporate reputation, response, and responsibility for a crisis event (2004) Journal of Business Communication, 41 (2), pp. 192-211; (2015) Nestlé posts first loss in 17 years after Maggi ban.

Employing a survey of 633 college students in the United States, this study examined the effects of college students’ public engagement on mobile phones and social media on their organizational identification and attachment and positive electronic word-of-mouth (e-WOM) communication. Findings suggested that college students’ public engagement with mobile phones and social media significantly impacted their attachment toward and identification with the university. Moreover, this study found that students’ public engagement and university identification strongly predicted their positive e-WOM communication about their university. Furthermore, students’ mobile phone engagement indirectly influenced positive e-WOM communication through organizational identification. The theoretical and practical implications of this study were also discussed. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Aaker, D.A., (1991) Managing brand equity, , New York, NY: Free Press; Avidar, R., Ariel, Y., Malka, V., Levy, E.C., Smartphones and young publics: A new challenge for public relations practice and relationship building (2013) Public Relations Review, 39, pp. 603-605; Bendell, J., (2000) Terms for endearment: Business, NGOs and sustainable development, , Sheffield, UK: Greenleaf; Bennett, W.L., Wells, C., Freelon, D., Communicating civic engagement: Contrasting models of citizenship in the youth web sphere (2011) Journal of Communication, 61, pp. 835-856; Bortree, D.S., Mediating the power of antecedents in public relationships: A pilot study (2011) Public Relations Review, 37, pp. 44-49; Bortree, D.S., Seltzer, T., Dialogic strategies and outcomes: An analysis of environmental advocacy groups’ Facebook profiles (2009) Public Relations Review, 35, pp. 317-319; Bowen, F., Newenham-Kahindi, A., Herremans, I., When suits meet roots: The antecedents and consequences of community engagement strategy (2010) Journal of Business Ethics, 95, pp. 297-318; Breakenridge, D., (2008) PR 2.0: New media, new tools, new audiences, , Upper Saddle River, NJ: Pearson Education; Brown, T.J., Barry, T.E., Dacin, P.A., Gunst, R.F., Spreading the word: Investigating antecedents of consumers’ positive word-of-mouth intentions and behaviors in a retailing context (2005) Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science, 33, pp. 123-138; Campbell, S.W., Kwak, N., Mobile communication and civic life: Linking patterns of use to civic and political engagement (2010) Journal of Communication, 60, pp. 555-563; Campbell, S.W., Kwak, N., Mobile communication and civil society: Linking patterns and places of use to engagement with others in public (2011) Human Communication Research, 37, pp. 207-222; Campbell, S.W., Kwak, N., Political involvement in “mobilized” society: The interactive relationships among mobile communication, network characteristics, and political participation (2011) Journal of Communication, 61, pp. 1005-1024; Campbell, S.W., Park, Y.J., Social implications of mobile telephony: The rise of personal communication society (2008) Sociology Compass, 2, pp. 371-387; Chu, S.C., Kim, Y., Determinants of consumer engagement in electronic word-of-mouth (eWOM) in social networking sites (2011) International Journal of Advertising, 30, pp. 47-75; Cramer, J., From financial to sustainable profit (2002) Corporate Social Responsibility and Environmental Management, 9, pp. 99-106; Crane, A., Livesey, S., Are you talking to me?

Insight into how and why individuals attempt to exert influence over organizations online is particularly underdeveloped. This study takes the first step in understanding sense of influence online through in-depth interviews with social media users. Findings call into question assumptions in research about the motives and meanings underlying individual efforts to exert influence via social media. The data from 19 in-depth interviews with active social media users suggest that sense of influence is enacted for social relationships rather than to influence organizations or society, and information is the driving force of that effort. Findings also place the imperative on strategic communication to emphasize the value of the organization’s role on social interaction toward a fully functioning society. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Austin, L., Liu, B.F., Jin, Y., How audiences seek out crisis information: Exploring the social-mediated crisis communication model (2012) Journal of Applied Communication Research, 40, pp. 188-207; Barnes, S.B., (2013) Social networks: From text to video, , New York, NY: Peter Lang; Botha, E., Mills, A.J., Managing the new media: Tools for brand management in social media (2012) Online consumer behavior: Theory and research in social media, advertising and E-tail, , Close A., (ed), New York, NY: Taylor & Francis; Briones, R.L., Kuch, B., Liu, B.F., Jin, Y., Keeping up with the digital age: How the American Red Cross uses social media to build relationships (2011) Public Relations Review, 37, pp. 37-43; Broom, G.M., Casey, S., Ritchey, J., Toward a concept and theory of organization-public relationships (1997) Journal of Public Relations Research, 9, pp. 83-98; Bruce, P., Shelley, R., Assessing stakeholder engagement (2010) Communication Journal of New Zealand, 11 (2); Campbell, C., Pitt, L.F., Parent, M., Berthon, P.R., Understanding consumer conversations around ads in a web 2.0 world (2011) Journal of Advertising, 40 (1), pp. 87-102; Chesebro, J.W., Borisoff, D.J., What makes qualitative research qualitative?

Grounded in uses and gratifications theory, consumption emotion theory, and temporal orientation framework, this study conducted an online survey among social media users in the United States (N = 940) to examine how individuals’ motivations, emotions, and temporal orientations in social media use might differ by multi-platform usage groups (i.e., Facebook+Instagram users vs. Facebook+Pinterset users). Our findings indicate that Facebook+Instagram users focus more on self-status seeking and entertainment, while Facebook+Pinterest users are more information-seeking driven and future-oriented. In addition, more optimism is detected among Facebook+Pinterest users. Implications for strategic communication theory development as well as insights for organization-stakeholder engagement on social media are discussed. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Al-Deen, H.S.N., Hendricks, J.A., (2013) Social media and strategic communications, , London, UK: Palgrave MacMillan; Anderson, M., Men catch up with women on overall social media use (2015) Pew Research Center, , http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2015/08/28/men-catch-up-with-women-on-overall-social-media-use/, August, Retrived from; Avery, E., Lariscy, R., Sweetser, K.D., Social media and shared—Or divergent—Uses?

This article contributes to the limited body of knowledge in the field by introducing the concepts, outlining opportunities and potential problems, and identifying current perceptions and applications in the professional field. A large-scale survey, with respondents from across more than 40 countries, explores the expertise of communication professionals, applications within communication departments and agencies, and consequences for the profession at large. The study shows a large gap between the perceived importance and current practices, a lack of competencies and ethical reflection, and a limited use of opportunities. The full potential of big data analytics and algorithms has not been leveraged until now, which calls for new initiatives in the practice and further research. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Ampofo, L., Collister, S., O’Loughlin, B., Chadwick, A., Text mining and social media: When quantitative meets qualitative, and software meets humans (2015) Innovations in digital research methods, , Halfpenny P., Procter R., (eds), Los Angeles, CA: SAGE Publications; Andersen, R., The emergence of content strategy work and recommended resources (2014) Communication Design Quarterly Review, 2 (4), pp. 6-13; Anderson, C.W., Towards a sociology of computational and algorithmic journalism (2012) New Media & Society, pp. 1-17; Banasiewicz, A.D., (2013) Marketing database analytics: Transforming data for competitive advantage, , New York, NY: Routledge; Banerjee, A., Bandyopadhyay, T., Acharya, P., Data analytics: Hyped up aspirations or true potential?

As sponsored content becomes more common, it raises novel ethical concerns that no industry alone can answer, such as How much disclosure is needed for transparency? Self-regulation via codes of ethics has been suggested as a remedy to meet the rising transparency expectations, and this article analysed 40 codes of ethics in the fields of communication, advertising, and journalism (United States and Finland) related to sponsored content. The results indicate that there remains excessive variation within the codes of ethics of how transparency of sponsored content is addressed. According to our analysis, most of the codes deal with transparency and the separation between commercial and editorial content only vaguely, and only eight of the total 40 guidelines take sponsored content into account. Therefore, we believe that the strategic benefit of sponsored content is threatened as long as no joint codes of ethics exist for sponsored content. To the degree that sponsored content is practiced across professions, we call for a joint code of ethics for sponsored content transparency, as the current codes of ethics fail to answer this emerging need. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"(2013), https://www.americanpressinstitute.org/publications/reports/white-papers/understanding-rise-sponsored-content/, November 13).

Our research question was whether media companies can gain legitimacy through CSR disclosures. There is reason to assume that CSR disclosures both directly increase and indirectly decrease a media company’s legitimacy. On one hand, CSR is regarded as a means of strengthening legitimacy; on the other hand, stakeholders might become skeptical and distrust disclosures about generous deeds. The experimental study detailed here considers both possibilities by using five CSR disclosures of a fictional media company as the stimuli, ranging from low- to high-communicated CSR engagement (single-factor between-groups design, 274 participants). According to the results of the Structural Equation Model (SEM), both assumptions are incorrect: CSR is not the crucial factor in determining whether or not stakeholders perceive a media company as legitimate, but rather its corporate credibility. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Altman, D.G., Bland, M., Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence (1995) BMJ: British Medical Journal, 311 (7003), p. 485; Altmeppen, K.-D., Journalistische Berichterstattung und Media Social Responsibility: Über die doppelte Verantwortung von Medienunternehmen (2011) Handbuch CSR.

Content analysis of 242 news articles and 200 corporate websites shows that although there are signs of a progressive CSR attitude, the news media and corporate discourse are still ignoring current issues and challenges relevant to Indian society. However, there were also indicators of tensions between moral and strategic intent, as well as intrinsic and extrinsic motivations that previous studies have argued should define CSR in the Indian context. Implications for international CSR research and practice in the context of sociocultural and media environment are discussed. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Arevalo, J.A., Aravind, D., Corporate social responsibility practices in India: Approach, drivers, and barriers (2011) Corporate Governance, 11, pp. 399-414; Aslam, A., (2006) Backgrounder: Corporate social responsibility, , New York, NY: Initiative for Public Dialogue.

To address this issue, this study proposes an emergent approach to strategy formulation by focusing on contextual impacts on social media crises and their implications for CCS. An online discussion on Sina Weibo, a Chinese microblogging platform, about a high-profile homicide in a McDonald’s restaurant, is taken as the case. Based on a multidisciplinary theoretical framework that consists of the theory of rhetorical arena and framing theory, an inductive framing analysis of 100 top forwarded posts indicates a complex negotiation process among multiple crisis communicators through various crisis frames. The results suggest that selection of CCS should be from contextually based behavior through investigating interaction among multiple crisis communicators and examining the contexts in which crises are situated. This study also contributes to advancing the CCS selection model of Situational Crisis Communication Theory by integrating contextual factors. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Akhavan-Majid, R., Mass media reform in China (2004) International Communication Gazette, 66 (6), pp. 553-565;

Through a national sample of communication professionals (N = 458), this study revealed the following key findings. The use of YouTube in professionals’ work, social media use in media relations, employee communications, and cause-related marketing/social marketing were significantly, positively associated with participants’ perceptions of the enhancing impact of social media use. Social media use in crisis management and employee communications significantly, positively predicted professionals’ perceptions of social media’s aggravating impact (e.g., extended work hours, increased workload) on their work. The use of Facebook and YouTube in strategic communication, the use of social media in environmental scanning, as well as the positive and negative impact of social media use all significantly and positively predicted communication professionals’ leadership behaviors. When the unintended negative effects of social media use happened, professionals perceived a low control over their work and thereby experienced a high level of time-based and strain-based work-life conflict. Finally, public affairs/governmental relations professionals who were frequent users of social media for their work reported a high level of strain-based work-life conflict. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Agostino, D., Using social media to engage citizens: A study of Italian municipalities (2013) Review, 39, pp. 232-234; Aldoory, L., Jiang, H., Toth, E.L., Sha, B.-L., Is it still just a women’s issue?

It examines the online information subsidies issued by the foreign ministries of three countries—the United States, China, and Singapore—to address a gap in the literature that has given scant attention to how governments use news releases through online newsrooms for public diplomacy. The study is significant for its conceptual explication of public relations and public diplomacy through an integrative strategic communication framework grounded in relationship building as an end goal of public diplomacy. A Leximancer textual analysis of 13,714 public diplomacy texts published through the three countries’ online press rooms over 5 years (2008–2012) found limited congruence in themes and concepts between and among the three countries, even on the issue of human rights, a major diplomatic point of contention. The weak congruence suggests a modelling of public diplomacy on one-way communication, and reveals a fundamental obstacle to grounding engagement, dialogue and collaboration strategically in a context of co-existence, understanding, mutual interdependence and relationship building. Through a three-country analysis, this study conceptually extends the view of public diplomacy beyond the dyadic construction of public diplomacy that dominates the existing literature. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Albright, M., (2013) The power of diplomacy: U.S. and EU approaches, , http://www.chathamhouse.org/sites/default/files/public/Meetings/Meeting%20Transcripts/190413Albright.pdf, Retrieved, June, 2013, from; Anderson, W.B., Crafting the national pastime’s image: The history of major league baseball public relations (2003) Journalism & Communication Monographs, 5 (1), pp. 6-43; Berkowitz, D., (1990) Refining the gatekeeping metaphor for local television news, , New York: Taylor and Francis; Bjola, C., Holmes, M., (2015) Digital diplomacy: Theory and practice, , New York, NY: Routledge; Cheng, Z., Golan, G.J., Kiousis, S., The second-level agenda building function of the Xinhua News Agency: Examining the role of government-sponsored news in mediated public diplomacy (2015) Journalism Practice, pp. 1-19; Chew, M., Human rights in Singapore: Perceptions and problems (1994) Asian Survey, 34 (11), pp. 933-948; Public diplomacy: A strategy for reform (2002) A report of an Independent Task Force on Public Diplomacy, , Washington, DC: Council on Foreign Relations; Cowan, G., Arsenault, A., Moving from Monologue to Dialogue to Collaboration: The Three Layers of Public Diplomacy (2008) Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science, 616, pp. 10-30; Curtin, P.A., Reevaluating public relations information subsidies: Market-driven journalism and agenda-building theory and practice (1999) Journal of Public Relations Research, 11 (1), pp. 53-90; Entman, R.M., Framing: Toward clarification of a fractured paradigm (1993) Journal of Communication, 43 (4), pp. 51-58; Entman, R.M., Theorizing mediated public diplomacy: The U.S case (2008) The International Journal of Press/Politics, 13 (2), pp. 87-102; Fahmy, S., Wanta, W., Nisbet, E.C., Mediated public diplomacy: Satellite TV news in the Arab world and perception effects (2012) International Communication Gazette, 74 (8), pp. 728-749; Fitzpatrick, K., Fullerton, J.D., Kendrick, A., Public Relations and Public Diplomacy: Conceptual and Practical Connections (2013) Public Relations Journal, 7 (4), pp. 1-7; Fitzpatrick, K.R., U.S. public diplomacy: Telling America’s story (2004) Vital Speeches of the Day, 70 (13), pp. 412-416; Fitzpatrick, K.R., Advancing the new public diplomacy: A public relations perspective (2007) The Hague Journal of Diplomacy, 2 (3), pp. 187-211; Fortner, R.S., (1993) Public diplomacy and international politics: The symbolic constructs of summits and international radio news, , Westport, CT: Greenwood Publishing Group; Frederick, H.H., (1993) Global communication & international relations, , Houghton Mifflin Harcourt P; Fullerton, J.A., Kendrick, A., Strategic Uses of Mediated Public Diplomacy International Reaction to US Tourism Advertising (2013) American Behavioral Scientist, 57 (9), pp. 1332-1349; Gamson, W.A., Modigliani, A., Media discourse and public opinion on nuclear power: A constructionist approach (1989) American Journal of Sociology, 95, pp. 1-37; Gandy, O.H., Information in health: Subsidised news (1980) Media, Culture & Society, 2 (2), pp. 103-115; Gandy, O.H., Is that all there is to love?

It also tests whether consumers’ involvement with the company’s products moderates these effects. Additionally, in the context of hybrid strategy, the order effect of receiving CA and CSR messages is discussed. Results of the experiment support the value of all three strategies in cultivating positive company evaluation. Findings pertaining to hybrid strategy scenarios generally show that a single CSR message performs as well as hybrid strategies because of the transferring effect of CSR. In addition, CSR was found to have an additive effect on CA when CA is the first message. However, the positive effect of CSR is discounted when CSR is the first message. Meanwhile, the moderating effect of product involvement is not supported. This study contributes to current strategic communication scholarship on corporate communication through proposing and empirically testing an interdisciplinary model that articulates the contingent relationship of corporate messages to consumer reactions. Its findings can aid in future theory building efforts and assist strategic communication professionals in determining the types of corporate communication messages, as well as the order in which they are presented, that will have an impact on consumers’ perceptions. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.",,,,,,,,,,"(2012) Building belief: A new model for activating corporate character & authentic advocacy, , http://www.awpagesociety.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Building-Belief-New-Model-for-Corp-Comms-2012.pdf, Retrieved from; Bennett, R., Härtel, C.E., McColl-Kennedy, J.R., Experience as a moderator of involvement and satisfaction on brand loyalty in a business-to-business setting (2005) Industrial Marketing Management, 34 (1), pp. 97-107; Berens, G., Riel, C.B.V., Bruggen, G.H.V., Corporate associations and consumer product responses: The moderating role of corporate brand dominance (2005) Journal of Marketing, 69 (3), pp. 35-48; Berens, G., van Riel, C.B.M., van Rekom, J., The CSR quality trade-off: When can corporate social responsibility and corporate ability compensate each other?

Results indicated that authentic leadership, organizational culture of supportiveness, emphasis on reward, and stability were significant predictors of the symmetrical internal communication system of an organization and EORs. Symmetrical internal communication cultivates quality EORs and mediates the effects of authentic leadership and cultural dimensions of supportiveness on EOR outcomes.

With respect to organizational identification, NGO managers expressed pride in their organization, frustration regarding public ignorance about their organization, and broader connection with NGO identity. Resulting identity tensions of certainty/uncertainty, transparency/opacity, and participation/restriction highlight that NGO managers identify more closely with their organization when it adheres to mission objectives and encourages stakeholder inclusivity, and less closely when their organization loses identity in the renaming process, or when there is less perceived transparency and inclusion. Findings suggest that NGO managers and organizational researchers may benefit from further investigation into renaming campaigns in light of NGO mission, as well as the resulting stakeholder identity implications. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.",,,,,,,,,,"Albert, S., Ashforth, B.E., Dutton, J.E., Organizational identity and identification: Charting new waters and building new bridges (2000) Academy of Management Review, 25, pp. 13-17; Al-sharafi, H., Rajiani, I., Promoting organizational citizenship behavior among employees: The role of leadership practices (2013) International Journal of Business and Management, 8 (6), pp. 47-54; Bejoy, K.T., Muradian, R., de Groot, G., de Ruijter, A., Confronting or completing?

Coworkers are, however, far from impulsive and spontaneous when they communicate on ISM. A case study in a Danish bank found that coworkers considered carefully the consequences of their posts or comments before publishing them. These coworkers perceived four different risks associated with ISM communication, and they used seven self-censorship strategies to ensure that both the content and the formulation of their communication were relevant and appropriate. Coworkers not only censor themselves by withdrawing, as previous studies have suggested, but they also postpone publishing content, phrase or frame content differently, imagine responses from organizational members, ask others for a second opinion, choose another channel, or write only positive comments. Through these seven self-censorship strategies, coworkers retain the quality of communication on ISM and prevent conflict or relational damage. Future research should explore the self-regulation strategies underlying self-censorship in order to improve understanding of the circumstances that increase the likelihood of responsible use of ISM. The potential dark side of self-censorship also requires exploration: when can self-censorship threaten coworkers’ freedom of expression, and develop into organizational silence? © 2016 Taylor & Francis.",,,,,,,,,,"Adler, P.S., Kwon, S.W., Social capital: Prospects for a new concept (2002) Academy of Management Review, 27 (1), pp. 17-40; Alvesson, M., Willmott, H., Identity regulation as organizational control: Producing the appropriate individual (2002) Journal of Management Studies, 39, pp. 619-644; Bateman, T.S., Organ, D.W., Job satisfaction and the good soldier: The relationship between affect and employee “citizenship (1983) Academy of Management Journal, 26 (4), pp. 587-595; Beers Fägersten, K., Snuff said!

The extant literature on professional roles in public relations has a tendency to render roles as static pregivens. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to contribute conceptually and empirically to role research by focusing on the process of “role-making” and how role actors purposefully engage in role construction in order to maintain legitimacy. The qualitative study of Scandinavian communication consultants reveals how these actors effectively refashion their role as expert advisors by describing the client and her problems, the competitors, their own knowledge and values. The role construct is supported by a narrative strategy and an epic storyline, where social media serves as a vehicle for self-definition and the consultancy role is framed and reinforced by social media. However, the jurisdictional claims of professional expertise and values that constitute the core of a consultant’s role construct are becoming increasingly difficult to sustain in a digital society. A critical reading of the consultants’ narrative thus implies that social media may in fact constitute a professional identity crisis rather than a consolidation of the expert role. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.",,,,,,,,,,"Abbott, A., (1988) The system of professions: An essay on the division of expert labor, , Chicago, IL: University of Chicago Press; Alikilic, O., Atabek, U., Social media adoption among Turkish public relations professionals: A survey of practitioners (2012) Public Relations Review, 38 (1), pp. 56-63; Alvesson, M., Organizations as rhetoric: Knowledge-intensive firms and the struggle with ambiguity (1993) Journal of Management Studies, 30 (6), pp. 997-1015; Alvesson, M., (2011) Interpreting interviews, , London, UK: Sage; Ashforth, B., (2001) Role transitions in organizational life: An identity-based perspective, , Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum; Bäcklund, J., Werr, A., Constructing the legitimate buyer of management consulting services (2008) Journal of Organizational Change Management, 21 (6), pp. 758-772; Berger, B.K., Reber, B.H., (2011) Gaining influence in public relations: The role of resistance in practice, , New York, NY: Routledge; Berger, P.L., Luckmann, T., (1991) The social construction of reality: A treatise in the sociology of knowledge, , London, UK: Penguin; Biddle, B.J., (1979) Role theory: Expectations, identities, and behaviors, , New York, NY: Academic Press; Biddle, B.J., Recent developments in role theory (1986) Annual Review of Sociology, 12, pp. 67-92; Bouwmeester, O., van Werven, R., Consultants as legitimizers: Exploring their rhetoric (2011) Journal of Organizational Change Management, 24 (4), pp. 427-441; Breakenridge, D., (2012) Social media and public relations: Eight new practices for the PR professional, , Upper Saddle River, NJ: Pearson Education; Broom, G.M., Smith, G.D., Testing the practitioner’s impact on clients (1979) Public Relations Review, 5 (3), pp. 47-59; Bruner, J., (1990) Acts of meaning, , Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press; Burt, T., (2012) Dark art: The changing face of public relations, , London, UK: Elliott & Thompson; Clark, T., Greatbatch, D., Knowledge legitimation and audience affiliation through storytelling: The example of management gurus (2002) Critical consulting.

We assume that mass media orientations within an organisation may affect an organisation’s external communication strategies of bridging and buffering. A survey among 150 Dutch communication professionals working for both for-profit and public organisations as well as NPOs was conducted. Our study shows that preferences for specific communication strategies are related to different forms of media orientation. Having media attention as an organisational goal is more strongly associated with buffering, that is, one-way and symmetric communication, yet a more negative attitude toward the media also hinders an organisation from bridging activities. Overall, few differences between the three types of organisations regarding communication strategies and media orientations were found. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.",,,,,,,,,,"Altheide, D.L., Snow, R.P., (1979) Media logic, , Beverly Hills, CA: Sage; Amenta, E., Caren, N., Olasky, S.J., Stobaugh, J.E., All the movements fit to print: Who, what, when, where, and why SMO families appeared in the New York Times in the twentieth century (2009) American Sociological Review, 74 (4), pp. 636-656; Andrews, K.T., Caren, N., Making the news: Movement organizations, media attention, and the public agenda (2010) American Sociological Review, 75 (6), pp. 841-866; Argyris, C., Schön, D.A., (1978) Organizational learning: A theory of action perspective, , Reading, MA: Addison-Wesley; Austin, E.W., Pinkleton, B.E., Dixon, A., Barriers to public relations program research (2000) Journal of Public Relations Research, 12 (3), pp. 235-253; Brickson, S.L., Organizational identity orientation: The genesis of the role of the firm and distinct forms of social value (2007) Academy of Management Review, 32 (3), pp. 864-888; Cancel, A.E., Cameron, G.T., Sallot, L.M., Mitrook, M.A., It depends: A contingency theory of accommodation in public relations (1997) Journal of Public Relations Research, 9 (1), pp. 31-63; Cancel, A.E., Mitrook, M.A., Cameron, G.T., Testing the contingency theory of accommodation in public relations (1999) Public Relations Review, 25 (2), pp. 171-197; Choi, Y., Cameron, G.T., Overcoming ethnocentrism: The role of identity in contingent practice of international public relations (2005) Journal of Public Relations Research, 17 (2), pp. 171-189; Christensen, L.T., Cornelissen, J., Bridging corporate and organizational communication: Review, development and a look into the future (2011) Management Communication Quarterly, 25 (3), pp. 383-414; Couldry, N., Hepp, A., Conceptualizing mediatization: Contexts, traditions, arguments (2013) Communication Theory, 23 (3), pp. 191-202; Cress, D., Snow, D., The outcomes of homeless mobilization: The influence of organization, disruption, political mediation, and framing (2000) American Journal of Sociology, 105 (4), pp. 1063-1104; Deacon, D., Stanyer, J., Mediatization: Key concept or conceptual bandwagon?

The change processes in the two cases of this study involved both a reorientation of the purpose of the communication function and a physical relocation of the professionals to a centralized department. In both organizations, the transformation toward a strategic management function failed and the communication professionals are now working in ways similar to those before the change was initiated. The analysis illustrates that the institutionalization of strategic communication is effected by organizational-level processes and mechanisms that are not always controlled by communication professionals. The institutionalization of strategic communication is bound by organizational discourses as well as by the actions of communication practitioners and general managers. The study also shows that macro- and mesolevel discourses influence the ways in which change initiatives are translated and strategic communication effected on an organizational level. Hence, institutionalization processes of strategic communication will comply with management trends but can change direction when these trends are challenged. Our results expose that new ideas or practices of strategic communication are translated discursively within organizations in processes of recontextualization, reinterpretation, and reframing. Consequently, new ideas and practices of strategic communication are adjusted to organizational discourses and organizational settings. The translation of a new idea or practice will therefore change the initial meaning of that same idea or practice. For that reason, institutionalization of strategic communication should not be reduced to a unidirectional process but conceptualized as a dynamic interplay between discourses on different levels that moves institutionalization in multiple directions. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.",,,,,,,,,,"Alvesson, M., Kärreman, D., Varieties of discourse: On the study of organizations through discourse analysis (2000) Human Relations, 53 (9), pp. 1125-1149; Chreim, S., Managerial frames and institutional discourses of change: Employee appropriation and resistance (2006) Organization Studies, 27 (9), pp. 1261-1287; Christensen, T., Lægreid, P., (2002) New public management: The transformation of ideas and practice, , Hampshire: Ashgate Publishing; Coombs, W.T., Holladay, S.J., Corporate social responsibility: Missed opportunity for institutionalizing communication practice?

Based on a quantitative content analysis, this study examines how social media, more specifically Sina Weibo, was used by the top 300 nonprofit public-fundraising foundations in China to advance their missions. Message strategy and dialogic communication strategy used to build and maintain organization-public relationships were identified. The result shows that top nonprofit foundations in China mainly relied on Sina Weibo to disseminate information, promoting issues and activities as well as calling for help. Two-way communication process and dialogic loops between foundations and audience were revealed. Audio, video, emotional appeals, dialogic, and interactive features have not been fully utilized, although micro-blog posts with certain multimedia and dialogic/interactive features were significantly more likely to be commented, shared, and liked. The implications of the findings are discussed. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.",,,,,,,,,,"Barash, V., Golder, S., Twitter: Conversation, entertainment, and information, all in one network (2011) Analyzing social media networks with NodeXL: Insights from a connected world, , Hansen D., Shneiderman B., Smith M.A., Burlington, MA: Morgan Kaufmann; Briones, R.L., Kuch, B., Liu, B.F., Jin, Y., Keeping up with the digital age: How the American Red Cross uses social media to build relationships (2011) Public Relations Review, 37 (1), pp. 37-43; Bürger, T., Use of digital advocacy by German nonprofit foundations on Facebook (2015) Public Relations Review, 41 (4), pp. 523-525; Carim, L., Warwick, C., Use of social media for corporate communications by research-funding organisations in the UK (2013) Public Relations Review, 39 (5), pp. 521-525; Chen, Y.R., Fu, J.S., How to be heard on microblogs?

From a corporate branding perspective, the choice of a new name can be seen as a wish to stand out from a group of similar organizations. Conversely, from an institutional perspective, name change can be perceived as a way to claim membership of a given organizational field. The framework integrates these understandings and serves a double purpose. First, it can be applied as a theoretical lens through which we can analyze and consequently understand naming in diverse sectors around the world. Second, it offers practical support to organizations, private as well as public, who find themselves in a situation where changing the name of the organization could be a way to reach either communicative or organizational goals. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.",,,,,,,,,,"Aaker, D.A., Joachimsthaler, E., (2000) Brand leadership, , New York, NY: Free Press; Albert, S., Whetten, D., Organizational identity (1985) Revealing the corporation: Perspectives on identity, image, reputation, corporate branding and corporate-level marketing, pp. 77-106. , Balmer J.M.T., Greyser S.A., (eds), 1st ed., London, UK: Routledge; Alvesson, M., Kärreman, D., (2011) Qualitative research and theory development: Mystery as method, , Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage Publications; Balmer, J.M.T., The three virtues and seven deadly sins of corporate brand management (2001) Journal of General Management, 27 (1), pp. 1-17; Balmer, J.M.T., An epiphany of three: Corporate identity, corporate brand management, and corporate marketing (2008) Facets of corporate identity, communication and reputation, pp. 35-55. , Melewar T.C., (ed), London, UK: Routledge; Baxter, L., Content analysis (1991) Studying interpersonal interaction, pp. 239-254. , Montgomery B., Duck V., (eds), New York, NY: The Guilford Press; Boxenbaum, E., Jonsson, S., Isomorphism, diffusion and decoupling (2008) Handbook of organizational institutionalism, pp. 78-98. , Greenwood R., Oliver C., Suddaby R., Sahlin K., (eds), London, UK: Sage; Coffey, A.J., Atkinson, P.A., (1996) Making sense of qualitative data, , London, UK: Sage; Cooper, M.J., Dimitrov, O., Rau, P.R., A rose.com by any other name (2001) The Journal of Finance, 56 (6), pp. 2371-2388; Cornelissen, J., Christensen, L.T., Bridging corporate and organizational communication: Review, development and a look to the future (2011) Management Communication Quarterly, 25 (3), pp. 383-414; Deephouse, D.L., Suchman, M., Legitimacy in organizational institutionalism (2008) Handbook of organizational institutionalism, pp. 49-77. , Greenwood R., Oliver C., Suddaby R., Sahlin K., (eds), London, UK: Sage; DiMaggio, P.J., Powell, W., (1983), http://www.jstor.org/stable/2095101, The iron cage revisited: Institutional isomorphism and collective rationality in organizational fields.

Strategic communication implicitly, perhaps even unintentionally, continues to rely on a classical understanding of organizations as “social units (or human groupings) deliberately constructed and reconstructed to seek specific goals” (Etzioni, 1964, p. 3). Assuming rather than exploring who the organization is, we argue, hinders a full explanation of how strategic communication works. Aiming to tackle this issue, we first present three ways in which the classical understanding of organizations is being theoretically challenged by organization studies and empirically challenged by new media, arguing that organizations are networked, sociomaterial, and contingent processes of meaning formation. Then we examine how the reconceptualization of the organization influences the concept of strategic communication, advocating that strategies should be seen as collaborative and networked flows (the how) of shared decision making by both human and nonhuman actors (the who). Finally, we discuss how this affects the notion of strategic action, and hence, strategic communication, asking what strategic action is and who performs it. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.",,,,,,,,,,"Anderson, J., Reckhenrich, J., Kupp, M., Strategy gaga (2013) Business Strategy Review, 24 (1), pp. 54-58; Argenti, P.A., Forman, J., (2002) The power of corporate communication.

According to the institutional approach, corporations and their reputations are enacted, sustained, and altered by their external stakeholders. This article posits that, in the online public sphere, corporate reputations are formed by narratives, in which stakeholders take different positions on intended actions. Using a qualitative data set derived from seventeen interviews with communication and risk management professionals, these positions were analyzed using a Burkean pentadic analysis combined with the Stakeholder Saliency Model. Using pentadic ratios, seven different narrative stakeholder positions were identified: Information seeker, Influencer, Pressurer, Communicator, Mender, Monitor, and Intermediator. These positions were taken by different actors, such as individual users, communities, online media and the organization itself. Analyzing the attributes of power, legitimacy and urgency related to these positions three transformations were identified: mobilizing crowds, issue recognition, and scene transformation. The proposed model helps to identify the different stakeholders in the digital communication sphere and to understand their agency through their narrative positions. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.",,,,,,,,This research was supported by Finnish Foundation for Economic Education and Tekes.,,"Anderson, F.D., Althouse, M.T., Five fingers or six?

Based upon an argument that the involvement in strategic communication is to be seen as part and parcel of a functional politicization of the civil service, the article identifies a significant and positive relationship between media awareness and functional politicization across the ministerial hierarchy as well as between media pressure and functional politicization, although moderated by organizational level and position. Based upon these empirical findings, the article demonstrates how strategic communication for pursuing and achieving political ends in central governments involves a permanent civil service aware of and positioned in organizations subject to pressures from the news media. The article discusses how these findings relate to different perspectives on strategic communication in central government organizations and identifies the need for mediatization research to re-emphasize central government organizations as organizations in their own right but just as importantly as an instrument for governments. Furthermore, the article points out the relevance for including non-elected actors into the research on political communication from politicians once elected into offices. The empirical analysis is performed in the context of Danish central government organizations. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.",,,,,,,,,,"Allison, G.T., (1971) Essence of decision, , Boston, MA: Little Brown; Andersen, L.B., Binderkrantz, A.S., Hansen, K.M., Forskningsdesign (2012) Metoder i Statskundskab, , Andersen L.B., Hansen K.M., Klemmesen R., (eds), Copenhagen, Denmark: Hans Reitzels Forlag; Aucoin, P., New political governance in Westminister systems: Impartial public administration and mangement performance at risk (2012) Governance, 25 (2), pp. 177-199; Bertelli, A.M., Sinclair, A., Lee, H., Media attention and the demise of agency independence: Evidence from a mass administrative reorganization in Britain (2015) Public Administration, 93 (4), pp. 1168-1183; Embedsmanden i det moderne folkestyre (2015) Bo Smith-udvalgets rapport om samspillet mellem politikere og embedsmænd, , Copenhagen, Denmark: DJØF Publishing; Canel, M.J., Sanders, K., Introduction: Mapping the field of government communication (2013) Government communication: Cases and challenges, , Sanders K., Canel M.J., (eds), London, UK: Bloomsbury; Deacon, D., Monk, W., Quangos and the communications dependent society (2001) European Journal of Communication, 16 (1), pp. 25-49; Dixit, A., Incentives and organizations in the public sector: An interpretative review (2002) The Journal of Human Resources, 37, pp. 696-727; Egeberg, M., How bureaucratic structure matters: An organizational perspective (2003) Handbook of public administration, , Peters G.B., Pierre J., (eds), London, UK: Sage; Eichbaum, C., Shaw, R., (2010) Partisan appointees and public servants: An international analysis of the role of the political adviser, , Cheltenham, UK: Edward Elgar; Esser, F., Strömbäck, J., (2014) Mediatization of politics: Understanding the transformation of Western democracies, , Basingstoke, UK: Palgrave Macmillan; Esser, F., Strömbäck, J., Conclusion (2014) Mediatization of politics: Understanding the transformation of Western democracies, , Esser F., Strömbäck J., (eds), Basingstoke, UK: Palgrave Macmillan; Frandsen, F., Johansen, W., Organizations, stakeholders, and intermediaries: Towards a general theory (2015) International Journal of Strategic Communication, 9 (4), pp. 253-271; Fredriksson, M., Pallas, J., Media enactments: Where to look for inspiration in mediatization studies (2014) Organizations and the media: Organizing in a mediatized world, , Pallas J., Strannegård L., Johnsson S., (eds), London, UK: Routledge; Fredriksson, M., Schillemans, T., Pallas, J., Determinants of organizational mediatization: An analysis of the adaption of Swedish government agencies to news media (2015) Public Administration, 93 (4), pp. 149-167; Garnett, J.L., Administrative communication: Domains, threats, and legitimacy (1997) Handbook of administrative communication, , Garnett J.L., Kouzmin A., (eds), New York, NY: Marcel Dekker; Graber, D.A., Political communication faces the 21st century (2005) Journal of Communication, 55 (3), pp. 479-507; Grøn, C.H., Salomonsen, H., Survey of Danish civil servants and politicians, 2014.

Research on strategic communication tends to oversee such differences and what consequences they have for what it is that mobilizes the use of communication in various settings. Informed by an increasing literature on organizational institutionalism we seek to overcome these limitations. With a textual analysis of policies and strategy documents from 179 Swedish government agencies, we examine what multiple and contradictory institutional conditions mean for how strategic communication is conceptualized. The results show that there are four frequent principles for strategic communication mobilized by the agencies. The results also show that a vast majority of the agencies are trying to handle conflicting principles when they form frameworks and strategies for their communication activities. We use the results as a point of departure for a discussion whether complex and pluralistic conditions are to be defined as problematic and necessary to be resolved (as mainstream literature would suggest) or as unavoidable and something authorities must be able to handle. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.",,,,,,,,,,"Åberg, L., Theoretical model and praxis of total communications (1990) International Public Relations Review, 13 (2), pp. 13-16; Argenti, P.A., Howell, R.A., Beck, K.A., The strategic communication imperative (2005) MIT Sloan Management Review, 46 (3), pp. 83-89; Blomgren, M., Hedmo, T., Waks, C., Struggles behind the scenes: Reputation managment in Swedish hospitals (2015) Organizational reputation in the public sector, pp. 163-184. , Waeraas A., Maor M., (eds), New York, NY: Routledge; Boltanski, L., Thévenot, L., (2006) On justification: Economies of worth, , Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press; Boxenbaum, E., Jonsson, S., Isomorphism, difussion and decoupling (2008) The SAGE handbook of organisational institutionalism, , Greenwood R., Oliver C., Sahlin K., Suddaby R., (eds), London, UK: Sage; Brown, A.D., Ainsworth, S., Grant, D., The Rhetoric of institutional change (2012) Organization Studies, 33 (3), pp. 297-321; Christensen, L.T., Firat, A.F., Torp, S., The organisation of integrated communications: Toward flexible integration (2008) European Journal of Marketing, 42 (3-4), pp. 423-452; Cloutier, C., Langley, A., Competing rationalities in organizations: A theoretical and methodological overview (2007) Cahiers De Recherche Du Géps, 3 (1); Coombs, W.T., (2014) Ongoing crisis communication: Planning, managing, and responding, , Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage; Czarniawska, B., Sevón, G., (1996) Translating organizational change, , Berlin, Germany: Walter de Gruyter; Falkheimer, J., Heide, M., Simonsson, C., Zerfass, A., Verhoeven, P., Doing the right things or doing things right?: Paradoxes and Swedish communication professionals’ roles and challenges (2016) Corporate Communications: An International Journal, 21 (2), pp. 142-159; Frandsen, F., Johansen, W., Institutionalizing crisis communication in the public sector: An explorative study in Danish municipalities (2009) International Journal of Strategic Communication, 3 (2), pp. 102-115; Frandsen, F., Johansen, W., Public relations and the new institutionalism: In search of a theoretical framework (2013) Public Relations Inquiry, 2 (2), pp. 205-221; Fredriksson, M., Olsson, E.-K., Pallas, J., Creativity caged in translation: A neo-institutional perspective on crisis communication (2014) Revista Internacional de Relaciones Públicas, 4 (8), pp. 43-64; Fredriksson, M., Pallas, J., Strategic communication as institutional work (2015) The routledge handbook of strategic communication, , Holtzhausen D., Zerfass A., (eds), New York, NY: Routledge; Fredriksson, M., Pallas, J., Wehmeier, S., Public relations and neo-institutional theory (2013) Public Relations Inquiry, 2 (2), pp. 183-203; Friedland, R., Alford, R.R., Bringing society back in: Symbols, practices, and institutional contradictions (1991) The new institutionalism in organizational analysis, , Powell W.W., DiMaggio P.J., (eds), Chicago, IL: The University of Chicago Press; Gregory, A., White, J., Introducing the chartered institute of public relations initiative: Moving on from talking about evaluation to incorporating it into better management of the practice (2008) Public relations metrics: Research and evaluation, , Ruler B.V., Vercic A.T., Vercic D., (eds), New York, NY: Routledge/Taylor and Francis; Grunig, L.A., Grunig, J.E., Dozier, D.M., (2002) Excellent public relations and effective organizations: A study of communication management in three countries, , Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum; Hallahan, K., Communication management (2004) Encyclopedia of public relations, 1. , Heath R.L., (ed), Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage; Hallahan, K., Holtzhausen, D., van Ruler, B., Verčič, D., Sriramesh, K., Defining strategic communication (2007) International Journal of Strategic Communication, 1 (1), pp. 3-35; Heide, M., Simonsson, C., Struggling with internal crisis communication: A balancing act between paradoxical tensions (2015) Public Relations Inquiry, 4 (2), pp. 223-255; Helder, B., (2011) Textual analysis: An approach to analysing professional texts, , Fredriksberg, Denmark: Samfundslitteratur; Holtzhausen, D., Zerfass, A., Strategic communication.

However, it often focuses on markets and perceives “corporations” as its role model. This means that the certain conditions that applies to other sectors—such as the public sector- tends to be overseen. Even though these conditions have extensive consequences for how, when, where, and why organizations can or are expected to communicate. This special issue is an attempt to reduce some of this imbalance and in this short introduction, we point out some of the characteristics that are typical for public sector organizations (PSO) in general; including their political nature, their lack of autonomy, their mission to handle problems rather than take advantage of an opportunities, their inherent conflicts between general principles, professional groups and stakeholder interests as well as an extensive demand for transparency.

Following a theoretical discussion of the interconnectedness of strategic communication and managerial legitimation, we present a case study analysis of management talk at three interrelated management meetings dealing with the implementation of New Public Management-based (NPM) reforms in a public sector organization. The context of NPM in the case study is particularly relevant for our investigation, because it sets the stage for the creation of legitimation by the public sector managers. Our analysis finds that these public sector managers use the integration of ‘voices’ (voices of authorization, rationalization and moral evaluation) of different actors (e.g., the Ministry, the organizational members, competitors, and partners) as a means of establishing legitimation. Specifically, this research shows how the integration of these (strong or weaker) ‘voices’ in management talk happens at a microlevel and is used as a particular mode of strategic communication. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.",,,,,,,,,,"Aggerholm, H.K., Thomsen, C., Strategic communication: The role of polyphony in management team meetings (2015) The Routledge handbook of strategic communication, pp. 172-189. , Holtzhausen D., Zerfass A., (eds), New York, NY: Routledge; Argenti, P.A., Howell, R.A., Beck, K.A., The strategic communication imperative: Companies that continue to take a tactical, short-term approach to communicating with key constituencies will find it increasingly difficult to compete.

This is the main question for this study, pursued through content analysis of one-stop web portals for national higher education from the 21 countries listed in the Times Higher Education’s Top 150 Universities ranking. Findings show that strategic communication is formed by national governments to depict their higher education sector as a coherent whole without letting prominent universities “represent” the higher education sector. The tension between similarity and difference that often occurs in public sector reputation-building is handled partly by emphasising similarity concerns in the structure and format of the presentations, and partly by emphasising differentiation concerns in the contents of the presentations. Furthermore, in contrast to previous studies addressing either the reputation management and branding efforts of single institutions, specific public sector entities, or those of nations, this study shows how higher education reputation-building integrates these different levels through strategic communication. © , Published with license by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC",,,,,,,,,,"Abolafia, M., Hatmaker, D., Fine-tuning the signal: Image and identity at the federal reserve (2013) International Public Management Journal, 16 (4), pp. 532-556; Anholt, S., Nation-brands of the twenty-first century (1998) The Journal of Brand Management, 5 (6), pp. 395-406; Anholt, S., (2006) Competitive identity–The new brand management for nations, Cities and Regions, , New York, NY: Palgrave; Antorini, Y.M., Schultz, M., Corporate branding and the conformity trap (2005) Corporate branding.

This article assumes that strategic communication may pave the way for a legitimacy-reputation dilemma, because organisations in highly institutionalised fields operate under strong isomorphic pressures to behave in line with shared norms and values in order to gain legitimacy. The article contributes to the discussion of the legitimacy-reputation dilemma by adding a sociological institutional perspective to strategic communication theory. Based on a qualitative in-depth study of what are assumed to be the most communicative hospitals in Sweden, the article investigates which strategies are used to balance the tension between legitimacy and reputation. The findings reveal that hospitals avoid unwanted institutional associations by communicating that they are ‘special in an ordinary way’. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.",,,,,,,,,,"Albert, S., Whetten, D., Organizational identity (1985) Research in organizational behavior, pp. 263-295. , Cummings L.L., Staw B., (eds), Greenwich, CT: JAI; Anell, A., Glenngård, A.H., Merkur, S., Sweden: Health system review (2012) Health Systems in Transition, 14 (5), pp. 1-159; Banerjee, S., Logo change: Little image touch up or serious overhaul!

By examining the Empty Plate Movement, a campaign advocating food saving in China, this study compared proactive engagement activities by traditional and virtual opinion leaders, organization advocates, and other participants. Specifically, this study focused on three proactive engagement activities: publishing descriptive and injunctive normative messages and messages showing supportive/adoptive behaviors. The findings reveal organization advocates are the most likely source of descriptive and injunctive normative messages, and the least likely source of messages showing adoptive/supportive behaviors. Virtual opinion leaders are the most likely to publish messages showing adoptive and/or supportive behaviors. Both message features and message sources influence users responses. The findings suggest that organizations practice strategic communication in advocacy. Because of their motivations for self-involvement and online interaction, virtual opinion leaders frequently publish messages about their supportive/adoptive behaviors. The strategic value of SNSs lies in the mimicking process. Practically, this study suggests that virtual opinion leaders and organization advocates are useful to advocacy campaigns on SNSs. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.",,,,,,,,,,"Ashforth, B.E., Mael, F., Social identity theory and the organization (1989) Academy of Management Review, 14 (1), pp. 20-39; Atkin, C.K., Anticipated communication and mass media information-seeking (1972) The Public Opinion Quarterly, 36 (2), pp. 188-199; Azjan, I., The theory of planned behavior (1991) Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes, 50, pp. 179-211; Belch, M.A., Krentler, K.A., Willis-Flurry, L.A., Teen internet marvens: Influence in family decision making (2005) Journal of Business Research, 58, pp. 569-575; Burke, M., Marlow, C., Lento, T., (2009) Feed me: Motivating newcomer contribution in social network sites, , Proceedings of the 27th Annual SIGCHI conference on Human Factors in Computing System, Boston, MA:; Burnett, G., Bonnici, L., Beyond the FAQ: Explicit and implicit norms in Usenet newsgroups (2003) Library & Information Science Research, 25 (3), pp. 333-351; Cha, M., Haddadi, H., Benevenuto, F., Gummadi, K.P., Measuring user influence in Twitter: The million follower fallacy (2010) Proceedings of the Fourth International AAAI Conference on Weblogs and Social Media, , Washington, DC:; Chan, K.K., Misra, S., Characteristics of the opinion leader: A new dimension (1990) Journal of Advertising, 19 (3), pp. 53-60; Cialdini, R.B., Descriptive social norms as underappreciated sources of social control (2007) Psychometrika, 72 (2), pp. 263-268; Cialdini, R.B., Borden, R.J., Basking in reflected glory: Three (football) field studies (1976) Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 34 (3), pp. 366-375; Cialdinii, R.N., Reno, R.R., Kallgren, C.A., A focus theory of normative conduct: Recycling the concept of norms to reduce littering in public places (1990) Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 58, pp. 1015-1026; Dalrymple, K.E., Shaw, B.R., Brossard, D., Following the leader: Using opinion leaders in environmental strategic communication (2013) Society and Natural Resource, 26, pp. 1453-1483; Dearing, J.W., Evolution of diffusion and dissemination theory (2008) Journal of Public Health Management Practice, 14 (2), pp. 99-108; Dearing, J.W., Maibach, E.W., Buller, D.B., A convergent diffusion and social marketing approach for disseminating proven approaches to physical activity promotion (2006) American Journal of Preventative Medicine, 31 (4S), pp. S11-S23; Feick, L.F., Price, L.L., The market maven: A diffuser of market place information (1987) Journal of Marketing, 51 (1), pp. 83-97; Gatignon, H., Robertson, T.S., A propositional inventory for new diffusion research (1985) Journal of Consumer Research, 11 (4), pp. 849-867; Hallahan, K., Holtzhausen, D., van Ruler, B., Verčič, D., Sriramesh, K., Defining strategic communication (2007) International Journal of Strategic Communication, 1 (1), pp. 3-35; Himelboim, I., McCreery, S., Smith, M., Birds of a feather tweet together: Integrating network and content analyses to examine cross‐ideology exposure on Twitter (2013) Journal of Computer‐Mediated Communication, 18, pp. 40-60; Ho, J.Y.C., Dempsey, M., Viral marketing: Motivations to forward online content (2010) Journal of Business Research, 63, pp. 1000-1006; Jeong, E., Jang, S., Restaurant experiences triggering positive electronic word-of-mouth (eWOM) motivations (2011) International Journal of Hospitality Management, 30, pp. 336-356; Kaplan, A.M., Haenlein, M., Users of the world, unite!

Norms of strategic communication are shaped by socially constructed standards of corporate social responsibility (CSR) and guide how strategic communication fosters organization-public relationships (OPR). Such norms are particularly important regarding deliberative strategic communication, which uses political CSR to guide corporations’ political role. Although principles of OPR and political CSR should foster more ethical strategic communication, some practices weaken such standards. To make that case, this article (1) reviews the historical foundations of deliberative discourse, (2) examines principles of OPR and political CSR, and (3) applies normative principles of deliberative discourse (4) to critique three cases of strategic political communication, known as astroturf lobbying, a deceptive lobbying practice that undermines and fakes grassroots movements. We conclude by integrating the findings into theory building that shifts CSR outcomes from advantaging individual organizations adding value to society. This theme uses ‘creating shared value’ to advocate shared strategic communication. This notion includes the normative claims of political CSR (open discourse, participation, transparency, accountability) to arrive at shared strategic communication that supports the ‘good’ organization and society simultaneously. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.",,,,,,,,,,"Nichomachean ethics (1952) Great books, 2. , Hutchins R.M., (ed), Chicago, IL: Encyclopaedia Briticannica, Inc; Rhetoric (1952) Great books, 2. , Hutchins R.M., (ed), Chicago, IL: Encyclopaedia Briticannica, Inc; Beschorner, T., Creating shared value: The one-trick pony approach – A comment on Michael Porter and Mark Kramer (2013) Business Ethics Journal Review, 17 (2013), pp. 106-112. , Nr. 1, S; Broom, G.M., Casey, S., Ritchey, J., Toward a concept and theory of organization-public relationships (1997) Journal of Public Relations Research, 9 (2), pp. 83-98; Burke, K., (1946) Kenneth burke file, , October, [Letter to Malcolm Cowley], State College, PA: Pennsylvania State University; Chappell, Z., (2012) Deliberative democracy.

Individual researchers open up new avenues of exploration and regularly arrive at answers to questions internally consistent with their respective perspectives. But the body of reasonably verified scientific knowledge that goes substantially beyond common sense remains underdeveloped. The author argues that biologist Edward O. Wilson identified the key characteristic of progressing fields correctly as consilience, i.e., the commitment to the unity of knowledge from physics to chemistry to biology and beyond: “a seamless web of cause and effect.” The article proposes that strategic communications research follow Wilson’s program, as other disciplines have done. For the field to mature, leading researchers need to work towards a consilient synthesis, i.e., a theoretical framework that contains nonrelativistic conjectures about the world which form a nucleus for research to accumulate around. It is furthermore necessary to reconnect strategic communication research to the rapidly progressing and highly relevant hybrid disciplines such as cognitive science and evolutionary psychology. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.",,,,,,,,,,"Baars, B.J., Gage, M.N., (2010) Cognition, brain, and consciousness, , Burlington, MA: AP, Elsevier; Barrett, L., Dunbar, R., Lycett, J., (2002) Human evolutionary psychology, , Basingstoke, UK: Palgrave Macmillan; Berger, P.L., Luckmann, T., (1966) The social construction of reality: A treatise in the sociology of knowledge, , New York, NY: Anchor Books; Bulbulia, J., Schjoedt, U., The neural basis of religion (2013) The neural basis of human belief systems, , Krueger F., Grafman J., (eds), Hove, UK: Psychology Press; Campbell, J.K., O’Rourke, M., Slater, M.H., (2011) Carving nature at its joints: Natural kinds in metaphysics and science, , Cambridge, MA: MIT Press; Canter, D., Turner, D., (2014) Biologising the social sciences.

However, listening is surprisingly and problematically overlooked in the large body of literature on organization-public communication including government, political, corporate, and marketing communication and related practices such as public relations. Based on critical analysis of relevant literature and primary research among 36 organizations in three countries, this analysis identifies a “crisis of listening” in organization-public communication and proposes strategies to address gaps in theory and practice including attention to the work of listening and the creation of an architecture of listening in organizations, which can offer significant stakeholder, societal, and organizational benefits. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.",,,,,,,,,,"Adler, R., Rodman, G., (2012) Understanding communication, , 11th ed., New York, NY: Oxford University Press; Atwill, J., (1998) Rhetoric reclaimed: Aristotle and the liberal arts tradition, , Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press; Bakhtin, M., (1981) The dialogic imagination: Four essays, , Austin, TX: University of Texas Press; Bakhtin, M., (1984) Problems of Dostoevsky’s poetics, , (C.

We argue that identity work is a core strategic communication effort, and furthermore that rhetoric is central to the process. To better understand such identity work, we engage in a case study of an emerging organizational form, social entrepreneurship (SE), by analyzing the identity rhetoric of three large SE umbrella organizations (Ashoka, The Skoll Foundation, Echoing Green). We find that SE identity work is constructed at both the organizational level and at the level of SE as a whole field or sector. Our contributions highlight the tensions brought about in communicatively constructing identity at multiple levels, and the need for further strategic communication scholarship that critiques identity work as arguments for a vision for social change agendas. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.",,,,,,,,,,"Albert, S., Whetten, D.A., Organizational identity (1985) Research in organizational behavior, , Cummings L.L., Staw B.M., (eds), Greenwich, CT: JAI Press; Alvesson, M., Kärreman, D., Varieties of discourse: On the study of organizations through discourse analysis (2000) Human Relations, 53, pp. 1125-1149; Auerswald, P., Creating social value (2009) Stanford Social Innovation Review; Bornstein, D., (2007) How to change the world: Social entrepreneurs and the power of new ideas, , New York, NY: Oxford University Press, USA; Brilliant, E., Young, D.R., The changing identity of federated community service organizations (2004) Administration in Social Work, 28 (3-4), pp. 23-46; Cheney, G., Christensen, L.T., Dailey, S.L., Communicating identity and identification in and around organizations (2014) The SAGE handbook of organizational communication, , Putnam L., Mumby D.K., (eds), 3rd ed., Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage; Cheney, G., McMillan, J.J., Organizational rhetoric and the practice of criticism (1990) Journal of Applied Communication Research, 18 (2), pp. 93-114; Conrad, C., (2011) Organizational rhetoric, , Cambridge, UK: Polity; Cornelissen, J., (2014) Corporate communication: A guide to theory and practice, , 4th ed., Los Angeles, CA: Sage; Crable, R.E., Vibbert, S.L., (1986) Public relations as communication management, , Edina, MN: Bellwether Press; Dees, J.G., A tale of two cultures: Charity, problem solving, and the future of social entrepreneurship (2012) Journal of Business Ethics, 111, pp. 321-334; Deetz, S., (1992) Democracy in an age of corporate colonization, , Albany, NY: State University of New York Press; Dempsey, S.E., Sanders, M.L., Meaningful work?

Findings show that English news media made largely oppositional readings, in contrast to the meanings encoded by the Chinese government. The research proposes that this was caused by the inherent tensions in China’s rhetoric, the top-down approach of propaganda, and the anticommunism ideology of the Western media, among others. This research provides an empirical case to illustrate Hallahan et al.’s (2007) proposition that meaning and influence are two fundamental emphases of strategic communication. It also provides an operational framework for analysis of political myth, which consists of four constructs, namely ways meaning is created, meaning created, meaning interpreted, and power relations manifested. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.",,,,,,,,,,"Adams, J.T., (1931) The epic of America, , Boston, MA: Little, Brown, and Company;

Multiple presidential information subsidies, national news content, and policymaking activity were monitored. The results revealed solid support for all three levels of agenda-building (i.e., object salience, attribute salience, and network associations among objects or attributes), but the linkages with media coverage and policymaking were not uniform across information subsidy types. Based on the analysis, presidential news releases, blog posts, and presidential speeches were the most effective all-around strategic agenda-building tools for media management and policymaking purposes during this time period. The theoretical and practical implications are discussed. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.",,,,,,,,,,"(2013) Top 25 U.S. newspapers for March 2013, , http://www.auditedmedia.com/news/research-and-data/top-25-us-newspapers-for-march-2013.aspx, Retrieved from; Avery, E.J., Graham, M.W., Political public relations and the promotion of participatory, transparent government through social media (2013) International Journal of Strategic Communication, 7 (4), pp. 274-291; Berger, B.K., Hertog, J.K., Park, D., The political role and influence of business organizations: A communication perspective (2002) Communication yearbook 26, , Gudykunst W.B., (ed), Mahwah, NJ: Erlbaum; Borgatti, S., Everett, M., Freeman, L., (1999) UCINET 6 for windows, , Natick, MA: Analytic Technologies; Boyle, T.P., Intermedia agenda setting in the 1996 presidential election (2001) Journalism & Mass Communication Quarterly, 78 (1), pp. 26-44; Bryant, J., Thompson, S., Finklea, B.W., (2013) Fundamentals of media effects, , 2nd ed., Long Grove, IL: Waveland Press; Carroll, C.E., (2005) Reputation by association: The news media’s agenda-setting power in the linking of firms with issues and other organizations, , November, Paper presented at the 4th Corporate Identity/Associations Research Group, The Netherlands: Rotterdam School of Management; Carroll, C.E., (2005) The news media’s role in forming corporate associations: A new level of analysis (and yet another new frontier) for agenda-setting theory, , October, Paper presented at the Università della Svizzera italiana, Facoltà di scienze della comunicazione, Istituto, Lugano, Switzerland: University of Lugano; Chaffee, S., Thinking about theory (2009) An integrated approach to communication theory and research, , Stacks D.W., Salwen M.B., (eds), 2nd ed., New York, NY: Routledge; Cohen, J.E., Presidential rhetoric and the public agenda (2005) American Journal of Political Science, 39 (1), pp. 87-107; Coleman, R., Wu, H.D., Proposing emotion as a dimension of affective agenda setting: Separating affect into two components and comparing their second-level effects (2010) Journalism & Mass Communication Quarterly, 87 (2), pp. 315-327; Cutlip, S.M., (1995) Public relations history: From the 17th to the 20th century: The antecedents, , Hillsdale, NJ: Erlbaum; Edwards, G., (2004) On deaf ears: The limits of the bully pulpit, , Westport, CT: Praeger; Entman, R.M., Framing: Toward a clarification of a fractured paradigm (1993) Journal of Communication, 43 (4), pp. 51-58; Eshbaugh-Soha, M., (2006) President’s speeches: Beyond “going public.”, , Boulder, CO: Lynne Rienner; Eshbaugh-Soha, M., Peake, J., Presidents and the economic agenda (2005) Political Research Quarterly, 58 (1), pp. 127-138; Fahmy, S., Wanta, W., Johnson, T.J., Zhang, J., The path to war: Exploring a second-level agenda-building analysis examining the relationship among the media, the public and the president (2011) International Communication Gazette, 73 (4), pp. 322-342; Foster, C., Thrasher, J., Kim, S.H., Rose, I., Besley, J.C., Navarro, A., Agenda-building influences on the news media’s coverage of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s push to regulate tobacco, 1993-2009 (2012) Journal of Health and Human Services Administration, 35, pp. 300-327; Retrieved from (2013) Presidential approval ratings – Barack Obama, , http://www.gallup.com/poll/116479/barack-obama-presidential-job-approval.aspx; Gandy, O.H., Jr., (1982) Beyond agenda-setting: Information subsidies and public policy, , Norwood, NJ: Ablex; Ghorpade, S., Agenda setting: A test of advertising’s neglected function (1986) Journal of Advertising Research, 26 (4), pp. 23-27; Guo, L., The application of social network analysis in agenda setting research: A methodological exploration (2012) Journal of Broadcasting & Electronic Media, 56 (4), pp. 616-631; Guo, L., Toward the third level of agenda-setting theory: A network agenda-setting model (2013) Agenda-setting in a 2.0 world: A tribute to Maxwell McCombs, , Johnson T.J., (ed), New York, NY: Routledge; Guo, L., Vu, H.T., McCombs, M., An expanded perspective on agenda-setting effects (2012) Exploring the Third Level of Agenda Setting.

Communicative leaders were defined and recontextualized as strategists, interpreters/translators, instructors/facilitators, and sensemakers, considering their communication behaviors and attitudes toward employees. Data suggest that the recontextualization of microdiscourses of communication and leadership emphasizes the interplay of local and global contexts in discourses of leadership. The data also indicate that contexts (and consequently macro- and microdiscourses) are blended in leaders’ and employees’ accounts, shaping constructions of communicative leadership depending on different contextual conditions. The interplay is important to form a suitable leadership discourse that makes sense for the local members and helps them work together more effectively. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.",,,,,,,,,,"Ailon, G., Mirror, mirror on the wall: Culture’s consequences in a value test of its own design (2008) Academy of Management Review, 33 (4), pp. 885-904;

Findings revealed that responsibility frames were dominant as the strategy used in environmental advertisements over time. The species/habitat protection issue was the dominant issue in 1990, and energy efficiency was the prevalent issue in 2000 and 2010. Advertisements primarily were sponsored by for-profit organizations and had a positive valence over time.

In this study, we investigate how civil servants use a blog in a government agency in Denmark and their viewpoints on the actual contribution of blogging for their organization’s communication goals. The study is longitudinal and qualitative. We collected and analyzed data from focus groups, interviews, observations and document analysis at different points of time from 2007 until 2013. The results indicate that the agency’s primary scope for blogging is increasing its visibility and being perceived as an expert source of information among the media and specialized publics. To a lesser extent, the government agency was able to communicate with the general public and involve its stakeholders by posting content of recreational nature and even less to develop dialogue with them. The analysis indicates that over the years blogging has become highly specialized and has lost part of its relevance, as it has not contributed to increasing agency visibility in the media nor to promote a more participatory and transparent government agency. This study shows that strategic communication via blogging for a government agency is often a complex, full of dilemmas activity to engage with, and its real value is often overestimated. © 2015, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Abdelsalam, H.M., Reddick, C.G., Gamal, S., Al-shaar, A., Social media in Egyptian government websites: Presence, usage, and effectiveness (2013) Government Information Quarterly, 30 (4), pp. 406-416; Andersen, K.N., Medaglia, R., Vatrapu, R., Henriksen, H.Z., Gauld, R., The forgotten promise of e-government maturity: Assessing responsiveness in the digital public sector (2011) Government Information Quarterly, 28 (4), pp. 439-445; Anderson, J.Q., Rainie, L., The impact of the Internet on institutions in the future (2010) Pew Research Center’s Internet & American Life Project, March 31, 2010, , http://www.pewinternet.org/, Retrieved from, on January 12, 2015; Aschenbrenner, A., Miksch, S., Blog mining in a corporate environment (2005) Research Studios Austria, Technical Report ASGAARD-TR_2005_11, Smart Agent Technologies, 2-19, , http://ieg.ifs.tuwien.ac.at/techreports/Asgaard-TR-2005-11.pdf, September, Retrieved from, on February 23, 2015; Thematic networks: An analytic tool for qualitative research (2001) Qualitative Research, 1 (3), pp. 385-405; Avery, E.J., Graham, M.W., Political public relations and the promotion of participatory, transparent government through social media (2013) International Journal of Strategic Communication, 7 (4), pp. 274-291; Baxter, G.J., Connolly, T.M., The “state of art” of organisational blogging (2013) The Learning Organization, 20 (2), pp. 104-117; Bertot, J.C., Jaeger, P.T., Hansen, D., The impact of polices on government social media usage: Issues, challenges, and recommendations (2012) Government Information Quarterly, 29 (1), pp. 30-40; Bonsón, E., Torres, L., Royo, S., Flores, F., Local e-government 2.0: Social media and corporate transparency in municipalities (2012) Government Information Quarterly, 29 (2), pp. 123-132; Braun, V., Clarke, V., Using thematic analysis in psychology (2006) Qualitative Research in Psychology, 3 (2), pp. 77-101; Bruns, A., Jacobs, J., (2006) Uses of Blogs, , New York, NY: Peter Lang Publishing; Catalano, C.S., Megaphones to the internet and the world: The role of blogs in corporate communications (2007) International Journal of Strategic Communication, 1 (4), pp. 247-262; Chun, S.A., Shulman, S., Sandoval, R., Hovy, E., Government 2.0: Making connections between citizens, data and government (2010) Information Polity, 15, pp. 1-9; Organization (2014) Official government agency website, , http://www.dkpto.org/facts–figures/organization.aspx, May 12, Retrieved from, on September 9, 2014; (2011) About us.

The primary function or mission of intermediaries is to mediate the relationship between an organization and its stakeholders; that is, to represent either the organization and/or the stakeholders, and/or to intervene in their relationship by furthering or impeding their interests and activities. We are in particular interested in how the specific status and function of intermediaries affect how they communicate. After a brief review of the research on stakeholders in general, and organization-stakeholder relationships and organization-public relationships in particular, a definition of intermediaries and a set of taxonomic criteria for the classification of intermediaries are presented.

Relationship contributes to predicting strength of political party affiliation, alongside personality. Weak relationships appear to be a significant indicator among those who are no longer loyal to their party and cross party lines. Future research should track the path of relationship from these first-time voters to more experienced voters and longer-standing constituents.

With an increasing number of organizations and brands involved in content marketing, it is becoming increasingly urgent for businesses to make strategic use of social media. In addition, the debate over “loss of control” calls for in-depth understanding of the dialogue between the brand and the public on branded social media sites. Given this background, a case study is employed to examine three branded blogs of Starbucks as Starbucks’ social media use is highly professional and advanced in comparison to most brands. The findings show that the socializing purpose of online communities is related to the affective and evaluative valence of proactive engagement. The use of conversation starters is significantly related to the size of proactive engagement. The use of hyperlinks is not associated with the evaluative valence of engagement. A significant positive relationship is revealed between the evaluative valence of proactive engagement and purchase intention. The findings suggest that the evaluative aspect of the emotional process links engagement with purchase intention, and brands should increase the sociability of their branded social media sites for brand lovers.

Using social network analysis, this study extends relationship management theory into the civil society arena and offers implications on how network approaches to examining relationships may help to move the theory forward. Using data gathered from a network of Peruvian civil society organizations, the article theoretically and methodologically links relationship management theory with social network perspectives, and the results of the study are discussed in terms of their contributions to extending relationship management theory and civil society research. Critiques of social network analysis and implications for its use in strategic communication research and theory development are also explored.

This study explored how social media use has affected leadership behaviors of 43 public relations leaders in the United States. Four key dimensions emerged from interview results on how public relations leaders can strategically use social media to establish leadership roles: exhibiting expert power, gaining decision power by demonstrating tangible outcomes, displaying leadership vision in social media use, and establishing leadership among peers. This study made theoretical contributions to the area of public relations leadership by developing three mechanisms for public relations managers to build their leadership through developing leadership capabilities in strategic social media management, gaining expert power to exert upward influence, and paralleling relationship building with peer leaders from other organizational functions. Suggested future research directions included how public relations leaders’ engagement in social media management has affected the whole leadership structure within the organization and to what extent public relations leaders could influence the ethical use of social media or the issue of social media governance.

The three case studies are the visit of Pope Benedict XVI to the United Kingdom, the marriage of HRH Prince William to Kate Middleton, and Queen Elizabeth II’s visit to Ireland. The analytical framework seeks to situate strategic communication theory within a political–economic environment pervaded by a dependence on the media and its institutions for sociopolitical knowledge. Therefore, while affirming the growth and influence of strategic communication as a social phenomenon, this article questions how processes of mediatization impact strategic communication, its organization and practices. The case studies reveal characteristic techniques such as managing mediated spaces for meetings and discussion; shaping the salience of target groups, stakeholders, and participants; an emphasis on values and norms that may be tailored efficiently to different circumstances; and, a strong focus on achieving strategic consistency across diverse messages and messengers. The results will be of interest to researchers and students interested in better understanding how organizations utilize complementary communicative techniques to shape knowledge and steer experiences of political events in ways supportive of their overarching goals. © , Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,"VetenskapsrÃ¥det, VR: 350-2012-343",The author wishes to thank the Swedish Research Council for their support (dnr 350-2012-343).,,"Andén-Papadopoulos, K., US soldiers imaging the Iraq war on YouTube (2009) Popular Communication, 7 (1), pp. 17-27; Bird, C., Strategic communication and behaviour change: Lessons from domestic policy (2008) Engagement: Public diplomacy in a globalised world, pp. 106-119. , Welsh J., Fearn D., (eds), London, UK: Foreign & Commonwealth Office; Comor, E., Bean, H., America’s ‘engagement’ delusion: Critiquing a public diplomacy consensus (2012) International Communication Gazette, 74, p. 203; Fitzpatrick, K.R., (2010) The future of U.S. Public Diplomacy: An uncertain fate, , Leiden: The Netherlands: Martinus Nijhoff Publishers; (2010) House of Commons Foreign Affairs Committee, Foreign and Commonwealth Office Annual Report 2008–09, , Foreign Affairs Committee (FAC), London, UK: The Stationery Office Limited; (2001) Foreign and Commonwealth Office Departmental Report 2001, , Foreign & Commonwealth Office (FCO), London, UK: Author; (2011) HMQ Visit to Ireland: Strategic Communications Plan; (2011) HM Queen’s State Visit to Ireland: Script, , Foreign & Commonwealth Office (FCO); (2011) HM Queen’s State Visit to Ireland - Joint Op-ed by the Foreign Secretary and the Irish Foreign Minister: International Coverage, , Foreign & Commonwealth Office (FCO); Gilmore, E., Hague, W., (2011) Joint Op-ed by the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Eamon Gilmore T.D. and the Rt.

First, image repair theory is used to analyze Paula Deen’s image repair campaign in the wake of the National Enquirer’s revelation that she admitted to using the “N-word” during a lawsuit deposition. Our analysis shows her response strategies were unsuccessful because her apology did not center on the allegations, and she was contradictory in her bolstering, minimization, and mortification strategies. We build on the Deen case study results by exploring the effectiveness of tweeted message strategies in a race-related crisis via Twitter. We use a mixed-design experiment examining how public figure type (politician v. TV celebrity) and response strategy (moral defense, performance defense, defiance defense, no defense) affect perceptions of a female public figure’s credibility and perceptions of the appropriateness of the response. Results show that any of the three responses are better than no response when addressing charges of racial insensitivity. A defiance defense, as newly tested strategy, and moral defense worked better for the TV celebrity condition than the politician condition. Implications are discussed. © , Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Adato, A., Arias, R., Dodd, J., Fleeman, M., Harrington, M., Lee, K., Baker, K.C., Braine, T., After a drunk-driving arrest and an anti-Jewish tirade, Mel Gibson checks in to rehab, saying “I am deeply ashamed (2006) People, 66 (7), p. 56; Apfelbaum, E.P., Norton, M.I., Sommers, S.R., Racial color blindness: Emergence, practice, and implications (2012) Current Directions in Psychological Science, 21 (3), pp. 205-209; Arnold, M., Controversy follows Deen’s diabetes campaign (2012) Medical Marketing & Media, 47 (2), p. 8; (2013), http://surveys.ap.org/data%5CGfK%5CAP-GfK%20December%202013%20Poll%20Topline%20FINAL_NYE.pdf, The AP-Times Square New Year’s Eve Poll.

Little research has focused on the influence of user comments on trust in NPOs regarding campaigns in social media. Stakeholders’ trust is seen as important for NPOs. Two experimental studies examine the influence of user comments with different connotations concerning campaigns that were published on the social networking site Facebook. The first experiment focused on the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF). The second experiment applied to a fictitious NPO, to avoid reputational influence. Irrespective of the NPO’s reputation, the results show that user comments in social media influence the perceived trustworthiness of NPOs. Negative comments resulted in a lower level of perceived trustworthiness. Positive comments, a balanced mixture of positive and negative comments, and the absence of any comments at all resulted in a higher level of perceived trustworthiness. In addition, the likelihood of an act of trust in the form of a donation or a recommendation of the campaign to others increased if the NPO was perceived as trustworthy. Finally, we were able to demonstrate the link between reputation and trustworthiness as two distinct constructs. Implications for the management of campaigns via social media are derived. © , Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,"Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG

The combination of social networking and mobile technologies presents an interesting phenomenon because the pervasive nature of mobile technologies significantly impacts on users’ privacy concerns about highly personal social media like Facebook. The massive amount of data collected from users’ mobile social media usage behaviors is beneficial to strategic communication professionals and practices. However, there are significant privacy concerns as a result of these big data applications. Because cultural context provides what is considered to be private and how individuals should respond to any infringement with their own privacy, Geert Hofstede’s 5-D cultural dimension framework was used as an interpretive framework to understand cross-cultural data collected from the Experience Sampling Method (ESM). The data were analyzed by examining country-specific differences in mobile social media users’ experiences, particularly, concerns over privacy among these cross-cultural mobile social media users. Individualism/Collectivism index was found to explain cross-cultural variations in our study. Theoretical and practical implications were discussed. © , Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Aquino, J., 5 hot marketing trends: Customer strategists must step up their engagement efforts as mobile’s mercury rises (2012) CRM Magazine, 16, p. 20. , January; Argenti, P.A., Howell, R.A., Beck, K.A., The strategic communication imperative (2005) MIT Sloan Management Review, 46 (3), pp. 83-89; Ball, S., (2014), http://www.prmoment.com/blog/strategic-communication-without-analytics-is-now-a-contradiction.aspx, March 3, Strategic communication without analytics is now a contradiction.

This integration is necessary to fully understand and explain the complexity of the phenomenon. As an observable manifestation of strategic communication, the campaign has received considerable attention across subdisciplines; however, no conceptualization of the strategic communication campaign as a distinct process has been forwarded, and no general theory has emerged to explain strategic communication campaigns or predict their outcomes. This article posits a definition of strategic communication campaigns that privileges the multidisciplinary capacity of the field and is distinct from other perspectives. In addition, an overview of current theoretical approaches that inform strategic communication campaigns is provided. © , Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Ajzen, I., (2005) Attitudes, personality, and behavior(2nd ed.), , Milton-Keynes, England: Open University Press/McGraw-Hill; Ajzen, I., Fishbein, M., (1980) Understanding attitudes and predicting social behavior, , Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice Hall; Atkin, C.K., Rice, R.E., (2013) Theory and principles of public communication campaigns.

More concretely, the intent is to increase understanding of how Findus Nordic in Sweden managed the crisis communication response and repair of its trust and corporate brand during and after the horsemeat scandal in 2013. The case study is based on a theoretical framework that consists of three theories or concepts: transboundary crisis, image repair strategy, and rhetorical arena. Findus Nordic followed its corporate values and applied a consistent image repair strategy: denial and blame shifting towards the supplier Comigel in an extremely multivocal arena. This strategy was supplemented with responsibility evasion. Towards the end of the public crisis, Findus Nordic used the crisis as an opportunity to recover their position and started a campaign that had a positive impact on trust and the corporate brand. The launch of the campaign was very fast and might have been dangerous. However, according to the analysis, the success of the campaign may be explained as a consequence of its sensemaking and auto-communicative approach. © , Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Ansell, C., Boin, A., Keller, A., Managing transboundary crises: Identifying the building blocks of an effective response system (2010) Journal of Contingencies & Crisis Management, 18 (4), pp. 195-207; Atkinson, P., Coffey, A., Analysing documentary realities (1997) Qualitative research: Theory, method and practice, pp. 45-62. , Silverman D., (ed), London, UK: Sage; Avraham, E., Crisis communication, image restoration, and battling stereotypes of terror and wars: Media strategies for attracting tourism to Middle Eastern countries (2013) American Behavioral Scientist, 57 (9), pp. 1350-1367; Badaracco, C.H., The transparent corporation and organized community (1998) Public Relations Review, 24 (3), pp. 265-272; Barnett, C., Cloke, P., Clarke, N., Malpass, A., (2010) Globalizing responsibility: The political rationalities of ethical consumption, , Oxford, UK: Wiley-Blackwell; Benoit, W.L., (1995) Accounts, excuses, and apologies: A theory of image restoration strategies, , Albany, NY: State University of New York Press; Boin, A., The new world of crises and crisis management: Implications for policymaking and research (2010) Review of Policy Research, 26 (4), pp. 367-377; Boin, A., Rhinard, M., Ekengren, M., Managing transboundary crises: The emergence of European Union capacity (2014) Journal of Contingencies and Crisis Management, 22 (3), pp. 131-142; Boin, A., ’t Hart, P., Stern, E.K., Sundelius, B., (2005) The politics of crisis management: Public leadership under pressure, , Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press; Botan, C., Ethics in strategic communication campaigns: The case for a new approach to public relations (1997) Journal of Business Communication, 34 (2), pp. 188-202; Bowen, S.A., What communication professionals tell us regarding dominant coalition access and gaining membership (2009) Journal of Applied Communication Research, 37 (4), pp. 418-443; Broms, H., Gahmberg, H., Communication to self in organizations and cultures (1983) Administrative Science Quarterly, 28 (3), pp. 482-495; Brønn, P.S., Reputation, communication, and the corporate brand (2010) The Sage handbook of public relations, pp. 307-320. , Heath R.

Results show that corporate prior ethical reputation affects consumers’ company evaluations regardless of CSR cause fit and information source, and that this effect is partially mediated by inferred CSR motives. Our study contributes to CSR scholarship in the domain of strategic communication. Through adopting an interdisciplinary approach advocated by strategic communication researchers, it carries current piecewise understanding of consumer responses to CSR a step forward to a holistic framework.

Connecting PCI and NI, this study aims to facilitate a better understanding of the formation of national image, as well as to achieve conceptual coherence about the role of valence framing in influencing people’s image perceptions and image building in the domain of mediated strategic communication. Using “Made in China” as an example in an experiment, a regression model reports significant direct and indirect framing effects over this process, and the framing influence on different dimensions of image perceptions. The practical implications for strategic communication campaigns within an international setting are also discussed. © , Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,This study was partially supported by a grant from the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences at Iowa State University.,,"Abrudan, M., Mucundorfeanu, M., Brand and nation-branding in the case of Romania (2009) Journal of Media Research, 5, pp. 89-100; Albritton, R.B., Manheim, J.B., Public relations effects for the Third World: Images in the news (1985) Journal of Communication, 35 (1), pp. 43-59; Anholt, S., Anholt nation brands index: How does the world see America?

In Experiment 1, we tested the effects of PIOC on individuals’ attention to the message, cognitive responses, and company evaluations. Results show that participants exposed to a PIOC message demonstrate fewer negative company-related thoughts and more positive company evaluations than participants exposed to a non-PIOC message. Experiment 2 was conducted to corroborate the results in an international setting and in comparison with the deliberate silence strategy. Results show that a PIOC message condition induced more positive company evaluations, while also reducing negative cognitive responses relative to a non-PIOC message and a nonresponse condition. © , Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Ahluwalia, R., Burnkrant, R.E., Unnava, H.R., Consumer response to negative publicity: the moderating role of commitment (2000) Journal of Marketing Research, 37 (2), pp. 203-214; Andriof, J., Waddock, S., Unfolding stakeholder engagement (2002) Unfolding Stakeholder Engagement: Theory, Responsibility and Engagement, 1, pp. 19-42. , Andriof J., Waddock S., Husted B., Rahman S.

Data from the 2013 Edelman Trust Barometer survey was used to analyze the relationship between stakeholders’ media use patterns and their trust in different types of organizations. Specifically, we focus our analysis on eight countries (four Western ones and the BRIC nations). Results suggest that media-source preferences do have an impact on public trust in business, government, and NGOs. Although we found trust levels to vary across different types of organizations noted above, an overall stable relationship between media selection and trust within each specific country is identified.

Although findings have been mixed among research on corporate mission statements' connection to performance, we found that looking for links in a CSR context lends new significance to mission statement instrumentality. Specifically, we content-analyzed Fortune 500 corporations' mission statements to compare/contrast language used regarding stakeholders and other specific characteristics central to CSR. Findings suggest that higher-performing corporations' mission statements devoted greater attention to accommodation variable components - such as desired public image, concern for satisfying employees, and concern for relationships. Higher-performing corporations' mission statements also attended more to advocacy variable components - addressing corporate concern for market/profit/product. Although findings do not definitively establish causality between mission statement and social/financial performance, discovering that higher-performing corporations attend more to stakeholders and to market/profit/product than lesser-performing corporations underscores mission statements' instrumentality and represents a more nuanced means for investigating mission statement/ performance linkages. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Amato, C.H., Amato, L.H., Corporate commitment to quality of life: Evidence from company mission statements (2002) Journal of Marketing Theory & Practice, 10 (4), pp. 69-87; Ashforth, B.E., Gibbs, B.W., The double-edge of organizational legitimation (1990) Organization Science, 1 (2), pp. 177-194; Banerjee, S.B., (2007) Corporate social responsibility: The good, the bad, and the ugly, , Cheltenham, UK and Northampton,: Edward Elgar Publishing, Inc; Banerjee, S.B., Corporate social responsibility: The good, the bad and the ugly (2008) Critical Sociology, 34 (1), pp. 51-79; Bart, C.K., Industrial firms and the power of mission (1997) Industrial Marketing Management, 26, pp. 371-383; Bart, C.K., Sex, lies and mission statements (1997) Business Horizons, pp. 9-18; Bart, C.K., Mission statements in Canadian not-for-profit hospitals: Does process matter?Health (2000) Care Management Review, 25 (2), pp. 45-63; Bart, C.K., Exploring the application of mission statements on the World Wide Web (2001) Internet Research, 11 (4), pp. 360-369; Bart, C.K., Baetz, M.C., The relationship between mission statements and firm performance: An exploratory study (1998) The Journal of Management Studies, 36 (26), pp. 823-853; Bart, C.K., Bontis, N., Taggar, S., A model of the impact of mission statements on firm performance (2001) Management Decision, 39 (1), pp. 19-35; Bartkus, B.R., Glassman, M., Do firms practice what they preach?

However, there is little empirical evidence on the accordance between both groups. Most research explores either communication professionals or chief communication officers (CEOs). Very few studies have combined both perspectives. This article identifies the research gap, explores insights from previous research, and contributes to the body of knowledge in strategic communication with an original study that is based on two surveys with replies from 602 CEOs and executive board members as well as 1,251 communication managers from companies in the largest European country, Germany. Although top executives rate the information and motivation of employees as the most important objective of corporate communication, communication professionals focus on the creation of a positive image. Respondents from both groups also state different opinions about dealing with the demand for transparency. Both top executives and communicators give most support to a role model that describes communication professionals as a facilitator between an organization and its publics. Nevertheless the overall conclusion is that perspectives diverge quite often and attention should be directed towards a better alignment between top management and those leading the strategic communication function. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,"Hypothesis 8 is supported by the data.

Having emerged during the 1950s, investor relations is a relatively new field that integrates the disciplines of communication, marketing, finance, and compliance with securities laws. Through qualitative interviews, the study provides insight into the relationship management function of investor relations from the perspectives of those whom investors ultimately hold accountable for a public company’s performance—CEOs. The dominant theme emerging from the study is the constant challenge CEOs of public companies face as they engage in relationships with investors, primarily due to the constraining effects of regulatory requirements. Although the study generally confirmed that the interviewees value Hon and Grunig’s qualities of trust, satisfaction, control mutuality and commitment in relationships with investors, CEOs’ most frequently discussed relationship quality that they work to achieve is trust. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"(2013), http://www.awpagesociety.com/insights/ceo-view-2013/, The CEO view: The impact of communications on corporate character in a 24x7 digital world.

Results show that, despite some differences, communication styles on both sites are more task-oriented than socioemotional-oriented. However, global brands adopt more “give suggestions” style (task-oriented) on Twitter but apply more “tension reduction” communication style (socioemotional-oriented) on Weibo. As for brand anthropomorphism strategies, global brands use more “first and second personal pronouns” on Twitter but more “nonverbal cues and consumer nicknames” on Weibo.

As both personalities determine the identity of a company and the relationship with its stakeholders, we investigate their relevance and the effect of incongruence between these two personalities on financial analysts. Eleven semistructured interviews were conducted to answer the theoretically derived research questions. Empirical findings show that both personalities are relevant to analysts and that perceived incongruence between these personalities can cause adverse effects. Company size, stage of company development and strength of the corporate brand emerge as influencing factors. The findings point to the importance of integrated communication concerning a company’s relevant personalities when relating to stakeholders. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Aaker, D.A., Jacobson, R., The value relevance of brand attitude in high-technology markets (2001) Journal of Marketing Research, 38 (4), pp. 485-493; Aaker, J.L., Dimensions of brand personality (1997) Journal of Marketing Research, 34 (3), pp. 347-356; Agle, B.R., Nagarajan, N.J., Sonnenfeld, J.A., Srinivasan, D., Does CEO charisma matter?

Drawing on an interdisciplinary methodological framework related to organizational identification theory and social semiotics, it proposes a multimodal analysis model through which several identification strategies are explored at the level of each semiotic mode and at the level of their interplay. The article explains how identity is strategically communicated in accordance with the potential and constraints of texts and images. It claims that by exploring how these semiotic modes reinforce, complement or subvert each other, the identification strategies can be more thoroughly addressed. Shedding light on how the multimodal interplay contributes to communicate identity, this model can also be employed by communicators in order to nuance and improve their strategic communicative practice. By examining the semiotic modes’ complex interconnectivity and functional differentiation in the strategic communication of identity, this article expands the existing research work as the usual textual focus is extended to a multimodal one. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Albert, S., Whetten, D., Organizational identity (1985) Research in organizational behaviour, , Cummings L.

The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in the United States announced that corporations may use social media to disclose mandatory key information required by law. With that ruling, social media communications leaves the sometimes fancy world of creativity and image creation and enters the core of strategic communication linked to corporate viability and success. Investor relations in general are essentially about engaging in dialogues with shareholders. Whereas disseminating information online is quite established, online dialogues offer a greater challenge. Dialogue-oriented and dialogic communication processes are not the same according to speech philosophy; and dialogic communication serves only as one possibility for corporations to build relationships with stakeholders. The research presented here analyzes how listed corporations deal with the highly participatory and fragmented communication environment on the web. The prevalence and intensity of social media dialogues was analyzed in an empirical study that focused on the 150 largest global corporations listed on DJIA (United States), FTSE (United Kingdom), CAC (France), DAX (Germany), and NIKKEI (Japan). A framework has been constructed to analyze dialogue-oriented and dialogic financial communications on the Internet and social web. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Argenti, P.A., (2007) Corporate communication, , 4th ed, New York, NY: McGraw Hill; Bassen, A., Basse Mama, H., Ramaj, H., Investor relations: a comprehensive overview (2010) Journal für Betriebswirtschaft, 60 (1), pp. 49-79; (2010), http://ssrn.com/abstract=1657169, Blankespoor, E., Miller, G.

This study, based on a content analysis, examines the relationships between the framing characteristics of news releases and subsequent publication to identify the predictors of news release selection for news coverage in the 2009 H1N1 A Influenza pandemic in Singapore. Through the news releases issued by the Singapore Ministry of Health and the resulting news stories in a Singapore newspaper, The Straits Times, this study found that six framing variables significantly predict a news release’s selection for news coverage: theme, episodic vs. thematic framing, emotion appeal, tone, gain vs. loss, and outbreak vs. nonoutbreak situation. News releases are more likely to be selected for news coverage when they focus on a preventive frame, rely on thematic framing, use emotion appeal, have a positive tone, are framed as gain, and are issued during an outbreak situation. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Akpabio, E., Management of “Killer” Indomie scare and impact on consumer confidence: A case study (2008) International Journal of Strategic Communication, 2 (4), pp. 244-252; Andsager, J.L., Powers, A., Social or economic concerns: How news and women’s magazines framed breast cancer in the 1990s (1999) Journalism & Mass Communication Quarterly, 76 (3), pp. 531-550; Ball-Rokeach, S.J., DeFleur, M.L., A dependency model of mass-media effects (1976) Communication Research, 3 (1), pp. 3-21; Bardhan, N., Transnational AIDS-HIV news narratives: A critical exploration of overarching frames (2001) Mass Communication & Society, 4 (3), pp. 283-309; Barry, J.M., May).

The results of the study indicate that the newspaper owners sound more certain in their communications with investors than expected by the normal range. In addition, some variations of the individual strategies showed unnecessary increases in language complexity and embellishment, which creates language that slows down the flow of information and de-emphasizes the actual actions performed by the management. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Allen, C.E., Building mountains in a flat landscape: Investor relations in the post-Enron era (2002) Corporate Communications: An International Journal, 7 (4), pp. 206-211; (2012) US Newspapers, , http://abcas3.auditedmedia.com/ecirc/newstitlesearchus.asp; (2005), http://online.wsj.com/public/article/SB111499919608621875-72vA7sUkzSQ76dPiTXytqgOMS5A_20050601.html; Argenti, P.A., (2007) Corporate communication, , 4th ed., New York.

However, shareholder activism with respect to CSR has thus far not received any scholarly attention in the field of strategic communication. This multidisciplinary study examines shareholder activism as a drive for change in CSR behavior. Using a case study approach, the study analyzes a shareholder resolution sponsored by NYC Public Pension Funds that resulted in an engagement process with CONSOL Energy Inc. regarding environmental responsibility. As a result of the engagement process, the company implemented a series of proactive procedural and structural changes. These findings suggest that reactive responses to societal demands of shareholders can elicit more proactive measures in CSR behavior that the target company would not have enacted otherwise. Consequently, the paper argues that an expanded role of investor relations pushes corporations to meet or even exceed societal expectations of a broader set of stakeholders. This change in practice ensures that corporations are committed to conducting socially desired actions in return for legitimacy in society. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,Greater Milwaukee Foundation,"This article is a part of a larger research project on shareholder activism for corporate social responsibility.

As in other world regions, parts of sub-Saharan Africa have, for decades, been trapped in a vicious cycle of conflicts and violence-in ethnopolitical and ethnoreligious contexts, even as foreign direct investment on the continent has increased 50% since 2005 and as the gross national product has increased significantly in countries such as Angola, Botswana, Kenya, Nigeria, and Rwanda, all of which are attracting international investors. This article examines the nation-building role of public relations by applying the general theory of relationship management, which is based on Grunig-Hunt two-way symmetrical model of public relations, to Sudan and Nigeria as a two-nation case study. It offers theory-informed guidelines that African states can use in managing conflicts and in developing communication strategies that engage stakeholders of disparate theological leanings at the individual level. The goal is to use communication strategies that emphasize mutually respectful Muslim-Christian dialogue on intractable, sensitive issues that have morphed into a bane of the economically burgeoning sub-Saharan African region, particularly. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Aapengnuo, C.M., Misinterpreting ethnic conflicts in Africa (2010) Joint Force Quarterly, 58, pp. 13-17; Abel, M., Richters, A., Memory, suffering, survival tactics, and healing among Jopadhola women in post-war Uganda (2009) Development in Practice, 19, pp. 340-349; Al Qurtuby, S., Peacebuilding in Indonesia: Christian-Muslim alliances in Ambon Island (2013) Islam and Christian-Muslim Relations, 24, pp. 349-367; Antal, C., Reflections on religious nationalism, conflict and schooling in developing democracies: India and Israel in comparative perspective (2008) Compare: A Journal of Comparative and International Education, 38, pp. 87-102; Ariyanto, A., Hornsey, M., Gallois, C., Group allegiances and perceptions of media bias: Taking into account both the perceiver and the source (2007) Group Processes & Intergroup Relations, 10, pp. 266-279; Ariyanto, A., Hornsey, M.J., Morton, T.A., Gallois, C., Media bias during extreme intergroup conflict: The naming bias in reports of religious violence in Indonesia (2008) Asian Journal of Communication, 18, pp. 16-31; Atzeni, M., Searching for injustice and finding solidarity?

One hundred seventy-five articles published in major communication journals from 1991 to 2011 were extracted as crisis communication articles. The results of a quantitative content analysis revealed that, among theories applied to crisis research, most were from communication and public relations disciplines, which included framing, image restoration, situational crisis communication, and excellence theory. Although outside disciplines that have studied crisis communication research included psychology, economics, mathematics, and sociology, those disciplines made up less than one-third of the articles. Regarding the methodological approach, each portion of articles using two or more methods (e.g., experiment and survey) and a triangulation approach (e.g., qualitative and quantitative) was less than 10%. However, the frequency of the triangulation, or mixed-method, approach has dramatically increased since 2006, which indicates that interdisciplinary crisis communication research is evolving into an interdisciplinary field. Another indication of this trend can be found in the variety of authors, institutions, and departments dedicated to crisis communication. Although crisis articles are published primarily by communication, journalism, and public relations departments, other diverse disciplines are also widely contributing to crisis communication research. © 2014 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Allen, M.W., Caillouet, R.H., Legitimation endeavors: Impression management strategies used by an organization in crisis (1994) Communication Monographs, 61, pp. 44-62; An, S., Cheng, I., Crisis communication research in public relations journals: Tracking research trends over thirty years (2010) The Handbook of Crisis Communication, pp. 65-90. , In: Coombs W.

This paper is organized as an in-depth case study of the TLC initiative, including interviews with key program developers. The research analyzes the TLC initiative as an exemplar of Entertainment-Education, and compares this example of Entertainment-Education to a strategic communication model. Known and accepted models of strategic communication that appear widely in the literature were referenced. To develop an Entertainment-Education model, a review of the relevant literature was conducted and social cognitive theory, elaboration likelihood model and diffusion of innovation theory were employed as foundational theoretical frameworks. Recommendations for future research on Entertainment-Education as a type of strategic communication are included. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Abroms, L., Maibach, E., The effectiveness of mass communication to change public behavior (2008) Annual Review of Public Health, 29, pp. 1-16; Bandura, A., Social cognitive theory for personal and social change by enabling media (2004) Entertainment-education and Social Change: History, Research, and Practice, pp. 75-96. , In A.

Developed and run as aWorldWildlife Fund (WWF) project in Sydney, Australia, Earth Hour was launched in 2007 as a symbolic ""lights off"" event. Five years later, 152 countries and over 6,895 towns, cities and municipalities have participated in this ""global display of climate action.""

However, there exist few theoretical deliberations on the underlying mechanisms of organization-public engagement on social media. This study focused on organization- public engagement and relationship management via social networking sites. We proposed and tested an integrative model that incorporated the antecedents of social media dependency, parasocial interaction, and community identification, as well as the effects of user engagement on relational outcomes of trust, satisfaction, and commitment. Acknowledging the worldwide popularity of social networking sites, the proposed model was tested among users of leading social networking site in China (i.e., Renren, Sina Weibo), the country with the world's largest Internet population and second- largest economy. The study findings well supported the proposed conceptual model.

The study argues that the reason for more enduring and salient transferring effects of prior CSR associations in crisis situations is because CSR associations are positioned on a company's virtue-related dimensions, whereas CA associations are positioned on its skill-focused dimensions. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Allen, M.W., Caillouet, R.H., Legitimation endeavors; Impression management strategies used by an organization in a crisis (1994) Communication Monographs, 61, pp. 44-62; Armour, S., Wal-Mart takes hits on worker treatment (2003) USAToday, , http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/money/workplace/2003-02-09-wal-mart-cov2x.htm, February 10, Retrieved from; Biehal, G.J., Sheinin, D.A., The influence of corporate messages on the product portfolio (2007) Journal of Marketing, 71, pp. 12-25; Brown, K.A., White, C.L., Organization-Public relationships and crisis response strategies: Impact on attribution of responsibility (2010) Journal of Public Relations Research, 23 (1), pp. 75-92; Brown, K.N., Wengreen, H.J., Dimmick, M., Eller, K., Frampton, A., Heaton, E.L., Staheli, T., Christensen, N.K., Improving diets of college students: Survey of dietary habits and focus group perspectives on how to best teach students (2011) Journal of Health Behavior and Public Health, 1 (1), pp. 23-29; Brown, T.J., Dacin, P.A., The company and the product: Corporate associations and consumer product responses (1997) Journal of Marketing, 61, pp. 68-84; Byrne, B.M., (2001) Structural Equation Modeling With AMOS: Basic Concepts, Applications, and Programming, , Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum; Coombs, W.T., An analytic framework for crisis situations: Better responses from a better understanding of the situation (1998) Journal of Public Relations Research, 10 (3), pp. 177-191; Coombs, W.T., (2007) Ongoing Crisis Communication: Planning, Managing, and Responding, , 2nd ed.).

This study examines the effects of a company's prior reputation and blog responsiveness on public perception of CSR motives, attitudes, and intention to engage in word-of-mouth (WOM) communication. The results show that prior company reputation has a strong effect on the public's interpretation of CSR motives, their attitudes towards the company, and their intentions to engage in WOM communication, while blog responsiveness influences the public's attitudes towards and perception of CSR motives. The interaction effect between prior reputation and blog responsiveness on WOM communication was confirmed, meaning that for a company with a negative reputation, responsiveness is critical when communicating CSR practices. We suggest that responding to the public's comments or questions about a company's CSR activities may convince them about the company's sincere motives whereas no response engenders suspicion toward a company's motives. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Aaker, D.A., Measuring brand equity across products and markets (1996) California Management Review, 38 (3), pp. 102-120; Ahluwalia, R., Burnkrant, R.E., Unnava, H.R., Consumer response to negative publicity: The moderating role of commitment (2000) Journal of Marketing Research, 37, pp. 203-214; Atkin, J.L., Beltramini, R.F., Exploring the perceived believability of DTC advertising in the US (2007) Journal of Marketing Communications, 13 (3), pp. 169-180; Bae, J., Cameron, G.T., Conditioning effect of prior reputation on perception of corporate giving (2006) Public Relations Review, 32 (2), pp. 144-150; Basu, K., Palazzo, G., Corporate social responsibility: A process model of sensemaking (2008) Academy of Management Review, 33 (1), pp. 122-136; Becker-Olsen, K.L., Cudmore, B.A., Hill, R.P., The impact of perceived corporate social responsibility on consumer behavior (2006) Journal of Business Research, 59, pp. 46-53; Bronn, P.S., Vidaver-Cohen, D., Corporate motives for social initiative: Legitimacy, sustainability, or the bottom line?

Given the dearth of studies of the strategic communication practices of non-West-based corporations and how such discourses are shaping the meanings of contemporary globalization, this study is a contribution to strategic communication via organizational communication and intercultural communication literature. The findings show that Haier's CEO and management discourse performs various rhetorical functions for internal and external stakeholders including leading, motivating, and inspiring Haier employees in China and around the world to navigate the global landscape with confidence. The ""glocal,"" hybrid, and transculturation practices highlighted within this discourse demonstrate that Haier is challenging West-centric interpretations of globalization in the 21st century. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Alvesson, M., Karreman, D., Varieties of discourse: On the study of organizations through discourse analysis (2000) Human Relations, 53, pp. 1125-1149; Appadurai, A., (1996) Modernity at large: Cultural dimensions of globalization, , Minneapolis, MN, Minneapolis, MN,: University of Minnesota Press; Baraldi, C., New forms of intercultural communication in a globalized world (2006) The International Communication Gazette, 68 (1), pp. 53-69; Bardhan, N., Culture, communication, and third culture building in public relations within global flux (2011) Public relations in global cultural contexts: Multi-paradigmatic perspectives, pp. 77-107. , In: Bardhan N., Weaver C.

Seventy-six global and Indian corporate websites were cross-examined to determine the prominence and extent of CSR reporting as well as the dimensions most salient in the CSR content to determine whether these corporations follow a global, local, or glocal CSR strategy. The findings revealed that most of the companies follow a global approach to CSR management and communication in India. This context-specific examination of CSR strategies expands the knowledge of global CSR practices. Also, it exemplifies how cultural, political, and economic environments can inform strategic communication's understanding of transnational CSR programs, and contribute to theory building in an emerging area of glocalization in a transnational context. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Arora, B., Puranik, R., A review of corporate social responsibility in India (2004) Development, 47 (3), pp. 93-100; Bardhan, N., Patwardhan, P., Multinational corporations and public relations in a traditionally resistant host culture (2004) Journal of Communication Management, 8 (3), pp. 246-263; Berg, N., Holtbrügge, D., Public affairs management activities of German multinational corporations in India (2001) Journal of Business Ethics, 30, pp. 105-119; Capriotti, P., Communicating corporate social responsibility through the Internet and social media (2011) The handbook of communication and corporate social responsibility, pp. 358-378. , In: Ihlen O., Bartlett J., May S., editors West Sussex, UK, West Sussex,: Wiley-Blackwell; Carroll, A.B., The pyramid of corporate social responsibility: Toward the moral management of organizational stakeholders (1991) Business Horizons, 34 (4), pp. 39-48. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0007-6813(91)90005-G; Carroll, A.B., Corporate social responsibility evolution of a definitional construct (1999) Business and Society, 38 (3), pp. 268-295. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/000765039903800303; Chahoud, T., Emmerling, J., Kolb, D., Kubina, I., Repinski, G., Schlager, C., (2007) Corporate social and environmental responsibility in India: Assessing the UN Global Compact's role, , http://www.die-gdi.de/CMS-Homepage/openwebcms3.nsf/%28ynDK_contentByKey%29/ENTR-7BMDUB/$FILE/Studies%2026.pdf; Chapple, W., Moon, J., Corporate social responsibility (CSR) in Asia: A seven country study of CSR web sites reporting (2005) Business & Society, 44 (4), pp. 415-441; Chaudhri, V., Wang, J., Communicating corporate social responsibility on the Internet: A case study of the top 100 Information technology companies in India (2007) Management Communication Quarterly, 21 (2), pp. 232-247; Child, J., Tsai, T., The dynamic between firms' environmental strategies and institutional constraints in emerging economies: Evidence from China and Taiwan (2005) Journal of Management Studies, 42, pp. 95-125; Cho, M., (2008) The level of glocalization of corporate social responsibility activities of multinational corporations: Content analysis of home and host countries' web sites, , August, August, Chicago, IL, Chicago, IL,: Paper presented at the annual meeting of the Association for Education in Journalism and Mass Communication, Marriott Downtown; Cohen, J., (1977) Statistical power analysis for the behavioral sciences, , Hillsdale, NJ, Hillsdale, NJ,: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates; (2009) 100 best corporate citizens 2009, , http://www.thecro.com/files/CRO100BestCorporateCitizensList2009.pdf, CRO; Dahlsrud, A., How corporate social responsibility is defined: An analysis of 37 definitions (2008) Corporate Social Responsibility and Environmental Management, 15 (1), pp. 1-13. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/csr.132; David, P., Kline, S., Yang, D., Corporate social responsibility practices, corporate identity, and purchase intention: A dual-process model (2005) Journal of Public Relations Research, 17 (3), pp. 291-313. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1207/s1532754xjprr1703_4; Dawkins, C., Ngunjiri, F.W., Corporate social responsibility reporting in South Africa: A descriptive and comparative analysis (2008) Journal of Business Communication, 45 (3), pp. 286-307. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0021943608317111; Deetz, S., Multiple stakeholders and social responsibility in the international business context: A critical perspective (1999) Organizational communication and change, pp. 289-319. , In: Salem P., editors Cresskill, NJ, Cresskill, NJ,: Hampton Press; Dhanesh, D., Better stay single?

Broad sections of the literature on consulting are marked by a very narrow focus on practical areas of application. The literature on management consulting, in particular, is largely practice-oriented and characterized by a low degree of scientific reflection on consulting practice. The objective of this article is to identify key building blocks of a sociologically based theory of external consulting in strategic communication and thereby redress a fundamental deficit in theory-building work. For this purpose, recourse is made to systems theory and the theory of systemic consulting, which represents the most fully developed theoretical approach to consulting at the present time. The central difference between classical organizational consulting approaches and systemic consulting lies in the understanding of the consultant's role. Whereas the role of the consultant in systemic consulting is primarily that of an observer who supports the client system through forms of systemic learning and self-reflection when overcoming complexity, classical approaches assign a more directive role to consultants. © 2013 Copyright Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Baecker, D., (1993) Die Form des Unternehmens, , Frankfurt/Main, Germany, Frankfurt/Main,: Suhrkamp; Bentele, G., Nothhaft, H., Auf der Suche nach Qualität.

Adapting and integrating indicators to assess professionalism, the study seeks to examine: 1) the level of expertise of public relations consultants in offering crisis management and communication consultancy to private and public organizations; 2) the level of experience of the consultants; and, 3) the value and expedience of the consultancy services offered to the clients. The research design comprised two stages. First, archival search of the websites of the public relations agencies that professed to offer crisis consultancy in the two countries was conducted. Second, the agencies that claimed to offer such services were contacted and a series of qualitative in-depth interviews with senior executives was conducted. The findings identified important differences and similarities between crisis consultancies in Singapore and Denmark. © 2013 Copyright Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Armbrüster, T., (2006) The economics and sociology of management consulting, , Cambridge, Cambridge,: Cambridge University Press; Brody, E.W., The credentials of public relations: Licensing?

The article begins by putting management consulting into context by relating it to three other fields of management: practice, education and publishing, pointing out how their interaction furthers the diffusion of management ideas. Then, the article provides an overview of the development of management consulting, showing how consulting activities and firms changed in line with their client organizations, while managing to derive continued legitimacy by adapting their image to different types of ""professionalism."" Finally, the article reviews the extant research on management consulting along three levels of analysis: industry, firm, and project, and discusses the implications of its main debates and insights for strategic communication consulting.The authors acknowledge support for the underlying research and the writing of this article from the European Commission (TSER Contract SOE1-CT97-1072) and the Marcus and Amalia Wallenberg Foundation. © 2013 Copyright Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,"European Commission, EC

The idea of communication professionals as consultants has already been introduced by a number of researchers. Nevertheless, the necessity of this task as well as the specific dimensions and practices of internal communication consulting have not been elaborated until now. This article takes an initial step towards closing this gap by developing a new framework. After a short introduction, the necessity of the consulting function will be emphasized by introducing the concept of the communicative organization. In order to fulfill this requirement, communicative competencies in a much broader sense have to be developed. This leads to a new challenge for communication professionals: they are asked to advise organizational members and to enable them to resolve communication-related issues as well as task-related issues. Based on a research review, a framework for internal communication consulting has been constructed by combining the dimensions of consulting forms and objectives. Qualitative interviews with communication executives have been conducted to verify the plausibility of this framework. The article closes by outlining implications for research, education, and practice. © 2013 Copyright Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,"One of the latest studies focusing on communication experts’ roles within organizations and stressing their consulting function is the research project Business Effective Communication supported by the Swedish Public Relations Association (Sveriges Informationsförening) (Hamrefors, 2009).",,"Arthur, W., Page Society (2007) The authentic enterprise, , New York, NY, New York, NY,: Arthur W.

A focus group with 13 strategic communication professionals and institutional partners unveiled their identification, roles, and responsibilities with the organizational motivations and strategy and the event itself: an annual festival. A face-to-face intercept survey of 575 visitors allowed the operationalization and testing of an index and identification of two factors of perceived authenticity (i.e., overall experience and active engagement), as well as significant associations between the dimensions and participants' gender, national origin, and age.

Until now, most research has considered integration a program of centralized control and has explored the impact of messaging and media that are coordinated for strategic impact. Underexplored are the internal implications of a concept that requires organizational change and stands to redefine functional boundaries.

The results suggest that CSR is important in China, with Chinese consumers having revealed a higher level of perceived importance of CSR and expectations about CSR than respondents in the United States. The findings also show significant differences between the two countries with respect to purchase intentions. These results are discussed in terms of the role of cultural values in perceptions and behavior towards CSR.

The analysis of data, consisting of 16 interviews and 84 hard copy and electronic documents, revealed that Arab embassies focus predominantly on media relations and reflect an old public diplomacy structure. Relationship management in public diplomacy may be complicated by political, cultural, and logistical constraints. In addition, the study suggests that religious diplomacy may offer new opportunities for government communication. Analysis of image repair strategies revealed that Arab embassies used three out of five strategies. Mortification and evading responsibility strategies were not used by the embassies. © 2013 Copyright Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Al-Kandari, A., Gaither, T.K., Arabs, the west and public relations: A critical/cultural study of Arab cultural values (2011) Public Relations Review, 37, pp. 266-273; Al-Yasin, Y., Dashti, A.A., Foreign countries and U.S. public relations firms: The case of three Persian Gulf states (2008) Journal of Promotion Management, 14, pp. 355-374; Barakat, H., (1993) The Arab world: Society, culture, and state, , Los Angeles, CA, Los Angeles, CA,: University of California; Bellamy, C., Weinberg, A., Educational and cultural exchanges to restore America's image (2008) The Washington Quarterly, 31 (3), pp. 55-68; Benoit, W.L., (1995) Accounts, excuses and apologies: A theory of image repair strategies, , Albany, NY, Albany, NY,: State University of New York Press; Benoit, W.L., Image restoration discourse and crisis communication (1997) Public Relations Review, 23, pp. 177-186; Benoit, W.L., Brinson, S.L., Queen Elizabeth's image repair discourse: Insensitive royal or compassionate queen?

Box 123, Broadway, Sydney, 2007, Australia; Zerfass, A., University of Leipzig, Leipzig, Germany","Organizations from government departments and corporations to small businesses are increasingly adopting social media for strategic corporate and organizational communication and public relations. This is seen by many as a positive development because the openness of the Web 2.0 environment potentially democratizes voice and affords participation, dialogue, and community-building. However, optimistic views of the benefits of organizational social media communication fail to adequately take account of potential conflict between the philosophy of openness that characterizes Web 2.0 and organizational strategy and management processes. Based on two international surveys from Australasia and Europe, this paper shows how social media are being deployed by organizations in a number of countries. These findings were further explored through depth interviews with a selection of social media specialists to examine how the tensions between the open, uncontrolled practices of social media and organizational strategy and management might be resolved or balanced, particularly in relation to objectives, control, and governance. The findings identify future directions in strategic communication that mediate the interests of organizations and online communities. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Aarts, N., (2009) Een gesprek zonder einde [A never end conversation], , Amsterdam: Vosspuspers; Aarts, N., van Woerkum, C., (2008) Strategische communicatie [Strategic communication], , Assen: Van Gorcum; Baxter, L., (2011) Voicing relationships: A dialogic perspective, , Thousand Oaks, CA, and London, UK: Sage; Bennett, W., Changing citizenship in the digital age (2008) Civic life online, pp. 1-24. , In: Lance Bennett W., editors Cambridge, MA: MIT Press; Bentele, G., New perspectives of public relations in Europe (2004) Public relations and communication management in Europe, pp. 485-496. , In: van Ruler B., Verčič D., editors Berlin and New York, NY: Mouton de Gruyter; Boler, M., (2008) Digital media and democracy: Tactics in hard times, , Cambridge, MA: MIT Press; (2010) Why social media project fail: A European perspective, , http://www.slideshare.net/Insidebsi/why-social-media-projects-fail-a-european-perspective?from=ss_embed, Brand Science Institute, Research report, 17 August.

Although most research on segmentation has used Grunig's situational theory of publics-a functional theory created for profit-based organizations-little attention has been paid to the process or thought behind how activist group organizations may segment their own publics. As such, this article discusses why the situational theory of publics is an inappropriate perspective from which to examine activist publics, and offers Giddens' structuration theory as a viable theoretical alternative to understand activist group publics. Using this framework, the article presents the results of an exploratory study of activist communication practitioners aimed at identifying how activists conceptualize and communicate with their publics. The results indicate that activist publics can be described by the dynamics of the power relationship a certain public has with the activist organization, and labels five recognizable activist publics as mediators, moderators, interferers, targets, and bystanders. Finally, implications for the role of structuration theory in explaining purposeful communication between organizations and publics are offered. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Aldoory, L., A (re)conceived feminist paradigm for public relations: A case for substantial improvement (2005) Journal of Communication, 55, pp. 668-684; Aldoory, L., Sha, B.-L., The situational theory of publics: Practical applications, methodological challenges and theoretical horizons (2007) The future of excellence in public relations and communication management, pp. 339-355. , In: Toth E.

The proposed models rely on various theoretical approaches such as Gilpin and Murphy's (2006, 2008, 2010) and Czarniawska's (2009) theories of ""classical"" and ""new"" paradigms for the understanding and practice of crisis management and crisis communication in general. This study's empirical material, on which the models are based and by which they are illustrated, comprises a series of in-depth interviews conducted between 2005 and 2011 with 24 Swedish strategic communication practitioners, who are experienced in the field of on-line crisis communication. Based on the study's results and the identified models, it is apparent that strategic on-line crisis communication is about more than just building relationships with external audiences and practicing issue management in times of crises. Therefore, this study highlights today's and tomorrow's interweaving of different logics and practices of strategic on-line crisis communication. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,"Myndigheten fÃ¶r SamhÃ¤llsskydd och Beredskap, MSB","This research was supported in part by grant from the Swedish Civil Contingencies Agency.

It describes the case of the Basque Country region where successive nationalist governments over the last 30 years have used soft and hard power methods for this purpose. The soft power methods have consisted fundamentally of the use of mass media campaigns and funded institutional publicity to generate a climate of opinion that opposes Basque identity and Spanish identity. Other soft power methods have involved the promotion of Basque culture, beliefs, and values through mostly public diplomacy efforts (which also had an impact among internal audiences). Soft power approaches have resulted in a positive climate of opinion concerning an inclusive (not ethnic) Basque identity without political connotations. Nevertheless, this positive outcome has been contradicted by other hard power approaches such as the implementation of coercive linguistic laws and a level of passivity towards terrorism. Far from reinforcing each other, the intensive use of one-way communication and hard power methods seems to have created a dissonance between Basque identity and Basque nationalism. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"(2011) History, , http://www.gastrovasca.com/es-asociacion-academia-vasca-de-gastronomia-historia.html, Academia Vasca de Gastronomía; Anholt, S., (2009) Places: Identity, image and reputation, , London: Palgrave Macmillan; Anderson, B., (1983) Imagined communities: Reflections of the origin and spread of nationalism, , New York: Verso; Aranda, J., La mezcla del pueblo vasco (1998) Empiria, 1, pp. 121-177; Arregi, J., (2000) La nación vasca posible, , Madrid, Criteria; Arregi, J., La estrategia del PNV y el terrorismo (2007) El Mundo; Arzalluz, X., I prefer a Black person who Speaks Basque, than a white person that does not speak it (1994) Argumentos para el bilinguismo, p. 143. , In: Royo J., editors Spain: Montesinos, Madrid; (1982), http://www.parlamento.euskadi.net/, Basic Law of Normalization of the use of the Basque Language; (2007) Kultura 07, , http://www.kultura.ejgv.euskadi.net/, Basque Observatory of Culture, Vitoria, Spain; http://www.kultura.ejgv.euskadi.net/r46518/es/contenidos/informacion/plan_deporte_2003_2007/es_6112/adjuntos/pres_plan_vasco_cas_23_07_03.pdf, Basque Plan of Sports 2003-2007, (2003); (2011) About Bculinary, , http://www.bculinary.com/public_sobre/ctrl_sobre.php, Basque Culinary Center; Benier, R., (1999) Theorizing nationalism, , Albany, NY: SUNY Press; Blasco, J.J., Public Funding of the Press in Spain's Autonomous Regions 2007: Tipology, Total Subsidies and Allocation Schemes (2008) Revista Telos, p. 75. , http://sociedadinformacion.fundacion.telefonica.com/telos/articulocuaderno.asp@darticulo=3&rev=75.htm; Burke, K., (1969) A rhetoric of motives, , Berkeley, CA: University of California; Calleja, J.M., (2002) ¡Arriba Euskadi!

The purpose of this article is to articulate a narrative vocabulary of corporate identity in order to address its implications for analyzing and storying identity. The central argument is that a narrative corporate identity vocabulary questions the usefulness of integrated communication and consequently introduces polyphonic assumptions regarding strategic organizational self-storying. Following a brief overview of existing corporate identity vocabularies articulated within mainstream research, a narrative vocabulary is constructed with reference to select contributions from organizational studies research. Third, an illustration of what corporate identity is when articulated from within a narrative point of view is offered with reference to the storying of the Danish-Swedish dairy cooperative Arla Foods during the controversy surrounding the 2006 Mohammed cartoon incident. Attention is given to the narrative construction and negotiation of the organization's identity with Danish consumers on its weblogs. In conclusion, focus is placed on the potential consequences a narrative vocabulary has for strategic self-storying. The consequences include ambiguous, collaborative and emergent storytelling practices. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Abosag, I., Dancing with macro-boycotters: the case of Arla Foods (2010) Marketing Intelligence & Planning, 28 (3), pp. 365-373; Alvesson, M., Kärreman, D., Working with mysteries and collapses: Empirical material as a critical conversational partner in theory development (2005) Kvalitative metoder i et interaktionistisk perspektiv.

Media data, in total 5,697 items, were collected from four newspapers in Finland over a period of six months in 2008. The interview data consist of eight interviews with Finnish party leaders. All materials were analyzed by qualitative content analysis. Two kinds of perspectives are described: the media perspective by illustrating what kind of descriptions, evaluations and requirements for communication of political leaders are established in newspapers and the political leaders' perspective by reporting the experiences and evaluations of political leaders themselves. These two perspectives are compared. The findings show that communication skills are a crucial part of competence of political leaders. Three main categories of communication competencies were oral communication skills, media skills, and leadership communication skills. The press emphasized public speaking and the party leaders themselves media skills and leadership communication skills, which seemed to be different from what the leaders in general have. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Bentele, G., Nothhaft, H., Strategic communication and the public sphere from a European perspective (2010) Internationa Journal of Strategic Communication, 4, pp. 93-116; Blumler, J., Coleman, S., Political Communication in Freefall: The British Case - and Others?

This article concerns a study of the Itaipu Technological Park, which was faced with the challenge of enacting an intensive and strategic communicational process. It indicates some ways in which communication can disclose strategy and strategic processes, at various levels of organizational analysis. Using the case method, this empirical research advances communication and strategic practices theory by contributing an empirical case. The case reveals insights into the interactions of strategies and practices as a fundamental process for creation of meanings whose expressiveness comes from communication and language. This strategy as communicational practice can occur at various levels of organizational relationships, and we are dependent on it to construct an organizational reality. The discussion of this idea is therefore the primary contribution of this study. The key issue is that humans communicatively constitute strategy by way of interaction and social practices that involve the entire organization and its environment. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Berger, P., Luckmann, T., (2003) A Construção Social da Realidade, , In: Fernandes F., editors Petrópolis: EditoraVozes TradOriginal work published in 1966; Bulgacov, S., Marchiori, M., Estratégia como prática: A construção de uma realidade social em processos de interação organizacional (2010) Comunicação e Organização: Reflexões, processos e práticas, pp. 149-165. , In M.

Specifically, it intends to examine the roles of organization-public relationships in each stage of the strategic management process, namely, strategic analysis, strategy formulation, strategy implementation, and strategic control. The findings show that OPRs can contribute to strategic analysis by being the source of information, channel of information, active information detector and foundation for internal analysis. It contributes to strategy formulation by providing broad information, incorporating intelligence, perspectives and insights and engaging employees in decision making. In strategy implementation, OPRs can generate support from parties involved and facilitate the strategy execution process. In strategic control, OPRs can provide feedback and updated information for strategy adjustments and strategy review, engage employee in self-management and facilitate organizational control through relational trust, commitment and satisfaction. Through playing multiple roles in each strategic management stage, relationships can eventually contribute to sustainable competitive advantage, achievement of organizational goals, and organizational effectiveness. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Berg, B.L., (2007) Qualitative research methods for the social sciences, , 6 th, Boston, MA: Allyn and Bacon; Broom, G.M., Casey, S., Ritchey, J., Toward a concept and theory of Relationships (1997) Journal of Public Relations Research, 9, pp. 83-93; Brunner, G., (2000) Measuring students' perceptions of the University of Florida's commitment to public Relationships and diversity, , Gainesville: Unpublished doctoral dissertation, University of Florida; Chen, Y.R.R., Effective government affairs in China: Antecedents, strategies, and outcomes of government affairs (2006) The future of excellence in public relations and communication management: Challenges for the next generation, pp. 477-506. , In: Toth E.

However, the kinds of information stakeholders rely on to decide about causes and responsibility for crises are still not well researched. Therefore, this study investigates if and how stakeholders covary organizations with crisis causes and how this affects their perceptions of organizational responsibility and reputation. An experimental study that was conducted with stakeholders of a German university showed that covariation information patterns as proposed by Kelley are significantly related to causal attributions. The subsequent structural equation modeling analysis revealed support for the assumption that organizational responsibility mediates the effect of causal attributions on reputation. Finally, potential applications of findings in the field of strategic crisis communication are discussed. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Allen, M.W., Caillouet, R.H., Legitimation endeavors: Impressions management strategies used by an organization in crisis (1994) Communication Monographs, 61, pp. 44-62; Benoit, W.L., (1995) Accounts, excuses, apologies: A theory of image restoration strategies, , Albany: State University of New York Press; Bortz, J., (1993) Statistik für Sozialwissenschaftler, , 4th, Berlin: Springer-Verlag; Bromley, D.B., (1993) Reputation, image and impression management, , Chichester, UK: Wiley; Byrne, B.M., (2001) Structural equation modeling with AMOS: Basic concepts, applications, and programming, , Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates; Cameron, G.T., Cropp, F., Reber, B.H., Getting past platitudes: Factors limiting accommodation in public relations (2001) Journal of Communication Management, 5 (3), pp. 242-261; Choi, Y., Lin, Y.-H., Consumer responses to Mattel product recalls posted on online bulletin boards: Exploring two types of emotion (2009) Journal of Public Relations Research, 21 (2), pp. 198-207; Coombs, W.T., Choosing the right words: The development of guidelines for the selection of the ""appropriate"" crisis-response strategies (1995) Management Communication Quarterly, 8 (4), pp. 447-476; Coombs, W.T., Information and compassion in crisis responses: A test of their effects (1999) Journal of Public Relations Research, 11 (2), pp. 125-142; Coombs, W.T., Impact of past crises on current crisis communication: Insights from situational crisis communication theory (2004) Journal of Business Communication, 41 (3), pp. 265-289; Coombs, W.T., (2006) Crisis management: A communicative approachPublic relations theory II, pp. 171-197. , In: Botan C.

Applying a discourse analytical approach, we empirically investigated how employees interpret and relate to management information concerning strategic goals. Inspired by Lewis (2000), the empirical analysis focuses on the disparate discursive positions expressed in interviews with employees. In particular, the article discusses organization-wide meetings as a potential forum for disseminating the goals of an enterprise, fostering a mutual understanding of the external, strategic context, and generating commitment to these strategic goals. The interview findings reveal how the asymmetric type of organizational communication that is characteristic for such meetings seems to generate more tension than unity within the organization due to decontextualized or deficient communication of multiple strategic goals and change initiatives, inconsistencies between the speakers, and heterogeneity among the receiving employees with their misaligned interests and intra-institutional incompatibilities. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Agar, M.H., (1986) Speaking of ethnography, , Newbury Park, CA: Sage; Aronson, J., (1994) A pragmatic view of thematic analysis, 2 (1). , http://www.nova.edu/ssss/QR/Backlssues/QR2-1/aronson.html, Qualitative Report; Ashforth, B.E., Kreiner, G.E., How can you do it?: Dirty work and the challenge of constructing a positive self-identity (1999) Academy of Management Review, 24, pp. 413-434; Bakhtin, M.M., Discourse in the novel (1981) The dialogic imagination, pp. 259-422. , In: Emerson C., Holquist M., editors Austin, TX: University of Texas Press; Balogun, J., Johnson, G., Organizational restructuring and middle manager sensemaking (2004) Academy of Management Journal, 47, pp. 523-549; Barrett, D.J., Change communication: Using strategic employee communication to facilitate major change (2002) Corporate Communications: An International Journal, 7 (4), pp. 219-231; Bateson, G., Jackson, D.D., Haley, J., Weakland, J.H., Toward a theory of schizophrenia (2000) Steps to an ecology of mind, pp. 201-227. , In: Bateson G., editors Chicago, IL: The University of Chicago Press; Bernard, R.H., (1995) Research methods in anthropology: Qualitative and quantitative approaches, , Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage; Boyatzis, R.E., (1998) Transforming qualitative information: Thematic analysis and code development, , Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage; Braun, V., Clarke, V., Using thematic analysis in psychology (2006) Qualitative Research in Psychology, 3, pp. 77-101; Deetz, S., Conceptual foundations (2001) The new handbook of organizational communication.

The study shows significant linkages among the constructs except for the effect that behavioral loyalty has on passive communicative action.

We see consumers' negative WOM as a process of problem solving when consumers encounter an organization's service failure that dissatisfies them. This study suggests a strategic management of public relations as a principle for consumer complaint management. Based on case studies, this study finds that negative WOM is formed by the dynamics of experience sharing, advice giving, agreement, and disagreement. In particular, we discovered that information sharing is predominant among negative WOM behaviors. Finally, the case study reveals that while a high-performing business tends to have a proactive approach to resolving consumer complaints, a low performer tends to have a defensive approach. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Best, A., Andreasen, A., Consumer response to unsatisfactory purchases: A survey of perceiving defects, voicing complaints and obtaining redress (1977) Law and Society Review, 11 (4), pp. 701-742; Blodgett, J.G., Granbois, D.H., Walters, R.G., The effects of perceived justice on complainants' negative word-of-mouth behavior and repatronage intentions (1993) Journal of Retailing, 69 (4), pp. 399-428; Boote, J., Towards a comprehensive taxonomy and model of consumer complaining behavior (1998) Journal of Consumer Satisfaction, Dissatisfaction and Complaining Behavior, 11, pp. 141-151; Day, R.L., Modeling choices among alternative responses to dissatisfaction (1984) Advances in Consumer Research, 11, pp. 496-499. , In: Kinnear Thomas C., editors Ann Arbor, MI: Association for Consumer Research; Day, R.L., Ash, S.B., Consumer response to dissatisfaction with durable products (1979) Advances in Consumer Research, 6, pp. 438-444. , In: Wilkie W.

We propose a dynamic model which highlights the impact of interpersonal communicative action in ongoing task negotiations in trust formation among organization members. According to our model, individuals approach initial negotiations with a baseline of trust in their organization which influences their initial level of cooperativeness and assertiveness when engaging in interpersonal task negotiations. Individuals' levels of cooperativeness and assertiveness then influences their communicative action (i.e., information acquisition, selection, and transmission), which, in turn, impacts the amount of trust these individuals perceive toward their counterpart (i.e., interpersonal trust). Finally, interpersonal trust impacts trust in the organization as a whole, at which point new tasks build on the previous cycle of negotiation and trust formation. We conclude by highlighting the conceptual contribution of the paper and its implications for both future research and organizational practices related to trust formation and workflow coordination. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Allert, J., Chatterjee, S., Corporate communication and trust in leadership (1997) Corporate Communications: An International Journal, 2 (1), pp. 14-21; Andrei, D., Otoiu, C., Isaila, A., Baban, A., What does it mean to trust your team colleague?

Hot-issue publics typically communicate actively only about a single problem that involves nearly everyone in the population and that has received extensive media coverage. Hot-issue publics tend to emerge when a triggering event occurs, such as an accident, crisis, or media controversy. Hot-issue publics, however, tend to dissipate after media coverage of the problem subsides. This study addresses the extent to which organizations need relationships with hot-issue publics or whether they need only to address media coverage of a crisis at the time it occurs. More than 90 qualitative interviews were conducted over several years with individuals about a number of hot issues. Results suggest that most hot-issue publics do not become active publics but that they remain aware after the problem gets less attention. Thus, organizations need to use principles of crisis communication to cultivate a short-term relationship with hot-issue publics and to continue a longer-term relationship with the now more aware public. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Bandura, A., Self-efficacy: Toward a unifying theory of behavioral change (1977) Psychological Review, 84, pp. 191-215; Dayan, D., Katz, E., (1992) Media events, , Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press; Dearing, J.W., Rogers, E.M., (1996) Communication concepts 6: Agenda setting, , Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage; Dewey, J., (1938) Logic: The theory of inquiry, , New York, NY: Henry Holt; Grunig, J.E., The role of information in economic decision making (1968) Journalism Monographs, 3, pp. 1-53; Grunig, J.E., Information and decision making in economic development (1969) Journalism Quarterly, 46, pp. 565-575; Grunig, J.E., Communication and the economic decision making processes of Colombian peasants (1971) Economic Development and Cultural Change, 19, pp. 580-597; Grunig, J.E., Developing economic education programs for the press (1982) Public Relations Review, 8 (3), pp. 43-62; Grunig, J.E., Communication behaviors and attitudes of environmental publics: two studies (1983) Journalism Monographs, 81, pp. 1-47; Grunig, J.E., Washington reporter publics of corporate public affairs programs (1983) Journalism Quarterly, 60, pp. 603-615; Grunig, J.E., Sierra club study shows who become activists (1989) Public Relations Review, 15 (3), pp. 3-24; Grunig, J.E., A situational theory of publics: Conceptual history, recent challenges and new research (1997) Public relations research: An International Perspective, pp. 3-46. , In: Moss D., MacManus T., Vercic D., editors London: International Thomson Business Press; Grunig, J.E., Paradigms of global public relations in an age of digitalisation (2009) PRism, 6 (2). , http://www.prismjournal.org/fileadmin/Praxis/Files/globalPR/GRUNIG.pdf; Grunig, J.E., Public relations and strategic management: Institutionalizing organization-public relationships in contemporary society (2011) Central European Journal of Communication, 41 (6), pp. 11-31; Grunig, J.E., Huang, Y.H., From organizational effectiveness to relationship indicators: Antecedents of relationships, public relations strategies, and relationship outcomes (2000) Public relations as relationship management: A relational approach to the study and practice of public relations, pp. 23-53. , In: Ledingham J.

A critical case study of the dynamic this paper examines Chinese students in Korea who once liked their host country, attracted by the appeal of Korean popular culture abroad (Hallyu), but dislike it as they interact with Korea's people and everyday culture and customs in the flesh. It also delves into their communicative actions in response to their strained contact experiences. To chart out the whole dynamic involving the Chinese, our study approaches it in both continuity and discontinuity with the experience of student sojourners in history. The conclusion of this investigation on the Chinese is both complex and troubling to Korea. Like their precedents in the past, the Chinese still harbor a prospect for recovering their once favorable feelings about their host country; however, this prospect has less chance to be realized as time passes. This paper explores the position that the experience of Chinese students would pose graver consequences and risks for Korea's soft power and argues the presence of foreign students is just the start of a dynamic long second-round sociological process for recalibrating real soft power. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Bae, J.S., Chinese account for 70% of foreign students (2010) Korea Times, , http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/2010/06/113_67966.html; Becker, T., Patterns of attitudinal changes among foreign students (1968) American Journal of Sociology, 73 (4), pp. 431-442; Bennett, J.W., Passin, H., McKnight, R.K., (1958) In search of identity: The Japanese overseas scholar in America and Japan, , Minneapolis, MN: Minnesota University Press; Black, J.S., Mendenhall, M., The U-curve adjustment hypotheses revisited: A review and theoretical framework (1991) Journal of International Business Studies, 22 (2), pp. 225-247; Chang, H.B., Attitudes of Chinese students in the United States (1973) Sociology and Social Research, 58, pp. 66-77; Cho, H.Y., A study of the perceptions of Hallyu and images of Korea among Chinese students in Korea (2003) Korean Journal of Sociology of Education, 13 (2), pp. 209-234; Choe, S.H., South Koreans struggle with race (2009) New York Times, , www.nytimes.com/2009/11/02/world/asia/02race.html; Chung, T.G., (1998) Nihon (Irubon) no Imeji: Kankokujin no Nihonkan [The Image of Japan: Korean Perception of Japan], , Tokyo, Japan: Chuo Koronsha; Coelho, G.V., (1958) Changing Images of America: A Study of Indian Students' Perceptions, , Glencoe, IL: Free Press; Davis, F.J., The two-way mirror and the U-curve: America as seen by Turkish students returned home (1971) Sociology and Social Research, 56, pp. 29-43; (2010) Chinese perceptions of Korea and proposals for strengthening Korea's public diplomacy toward China, , East Asia Institute and Sciences, Social, Seoul, Korea: National Research Council for Economics, Humanities; Farrar, L., 'Korean Wave' of pop culture sweeps across Asia (2010) CNN.com, , http://edition.cnn.com/2010/WORLD/asiapcf/12/31/korea.entertainment, December 31; Golden, J.S., Student adjustment abroad: A psychiatrist's view (1973) International Education and Cultural Exchange, 8 (4), pp. 28-36; Greenblat, C., Foreign students in the U.S.: A study of attitudes and orientations (1971) Sociological Focus, 4 (3), pp. 17-35; Han, D., Zweig, D., Images of the World: Studying abroad and Chinese attitudes towards international affairs (2010) China Quarterly, 202, pp. 290-306; Heath, L., Foreign student attitudes (1970) International Education and Cultural Exchange, 5 (3), pp. 66-70; (1997) Tokyo Daigaku no Kankokujin Ryugakusei: Sono Seikatsu Jokyo to Nikan Kankei e no Teigen [Korean International Students at the University of Tokyo: Their Living Conditions and Proposals for Japan-Korea Relations], , Higashi Chiiki Kenkyukai, Tokyo, Japan: Tokyo University Press; Hofstede, G., (2001) Cultural consequences, , Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage; Hogg, C., Japan racism ""deep and profound"" (2005) BBC News, , http://news.bbc.co.uk/go/pr/fr/-/2/hi/asia-pacific/4671687.stm, July 11; Hsiao-Ying, T., Sojourner adjustment: The case of foreigners in Japan (1995) Journal of Cross-Cultural Psychology, 26 (5), pp. 523-536; Hull, W.F., (1978) Foreign Students in the U.S, , New York: Praeger; Iwao, S., Hagiwara, K., (1991) Nihon de Manabu Ryugakusei- Shakai Shinrigaku Bunseki [International Students in Japan: Social Psychological Analysis], , Tokyo: Keisoushobo; Kakuchi, S., Japan-China: Moving closer, say students and academics (2010) University World News, , http://www.universityworldnews.com/article.php?story=20100911065818454, September 12; Kang, B.L., Japan-educated Chinese don't hate Japan: survey (2007) Reuters, , http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/04/12/us-japan-china-survey-idUSPEK29159620070412, April 12; Kim, J.-N., Grunig, J.E., Problem solving and communicative action: A situational theory of problem solving (2011) Journal of Communication, 61, pp. 120-149; Kim, J.-N., Grunig, J.E., Ni, L., Reconceptualizing the communicative action of publics: Acquisition, selection, and transmission of information in problematic situations (2010) International Journal of Strategic Communication, 4 (2), pp. 126-154; Kim, J.-N., Ni, L., The nexus between Hallyu and soft power: Cultural public diplomacy in the era of sociological globalism (2011) Hallyu: Influence of Korean popular culture in Asia and beyond, pp. 131-154. , In: Kim D.

It aims to explore how relationships can be managed strategically to influence the formation of important publics through influencing the perceptual variables in the situational theory of problem solving (STOPS, J.

In other words, how relationships can be managed strategically to bring value to an organization through potentially fostering or cultivating different types of publics that are critical to organizations. This article is a conceptual piece laying out the necessity of studying the formation of and potential change in publics using a quasi-cross-situational approach. Given the importance of understanding publics as well as the complexity in the process of how these publics are formed and how they might be changed, research should start to delve into exploring factors that will influence the perceptual variables of different publics facing the same situation. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Aldoory, L., Making health communications meaningful for women: Factors that influence involvement (2001) Journal of Public Relations Research, 13, pp. 163-185; Bishop, J.W., Scott, K.D., Burroughs, S.M., Support, Commitment, and employee outcomes in a team environment (2000) Journal of Management, 26, pp. 1113-1132; Clarke, P., Kline, F.G., Mass media effects reconsidered: Some new strategies for communication research (1974) Communication Research, 1, pp. 224-270; Eagley, A.H., Chaiken, S., (1993) The psychology of attitudes, , Fort Worth, TX: Harcourt Brace; Grunig, J.E., A situational theory of publics: Conceptual history, recent challenges and new research (1997) Public Relations Research: An international perspective, pp. 3-48. , In: Moss D., MacManus T., Vercic D., editors London: International Thomson Business Press; Grunig, J.E., Huang, Y., From organizational effectiveness to relationship indicators: Antecedents of relationships, public relations strategies, and relationship outcomes (2000) Public relations as relationship management: A relational approach to the study and practice of public relations, pp. 23-53. , In: Ledingham J.

Study suggests, that stakeholder theory is useful in identifying and prioritizing stakeholders that organization is aware of. However, theory is argued being ineffective in finding stakeholders on new environments (social media), where connectivity and relationships play a key role. The argument stems from the need to assess stakeholder presence beyond the dyadic ties. Consequently, the combination of the Stakeholder Salience Model (SSM) and social network analysis (SNA) is proposed as a more holistic solution for stakeholder identification including those from social media. A process of finding ""unknown"" but important stakeholders from social media was identified incorporating the content search and the principles of SNA. Consequently, stakeholders from social media are identified based on the dimensions of connectivity and the content shared. Accordingly, the study introduces four groups of important actors from social media: unconcerned lurkers, unconcerned influencers, concerned lurkers and concerned influencers and integrates them into the existing Stakeholder Salience Model (SSM). © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Barabasi, A.L., (2002) Linked: The New Science of Networks, , Cambridge, MA: Perseus Publishing; Baumann, S., (2010) Political Campaigning 2.0: Are Grassroots Activation Strategies and Citizen Participation the New Scheme to Win Elections?, pp. 12-15. , Paper Presented At ECREA 3rd Conference ""Transcultural Communication - Intercultural Comparisons,"" Hamburg; Bekmeier-Feuerhahn, S., Eichenlaub, A., What makes for trusting relationships in online communication?

It also looks at how congruent CSR strategies are with cultural values of the host country. It used a qualitative analysis of 90 news releases found on Romanian Web sites of U.S. corporations, written in Romanian, and analyzed by Romanian researchers who provided a cultural lens through which to assess cultural congruency. Findings show CSR activities of U.S. companies are not always congruent with Romanian cultural norms, but may contribute to a culture-building process in transitional, post-Communist countries. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Bohas, A., The paradox of anti-Americanism: Reflection on the shallow concept of soft power (2006) Global Society, 20, pp. 395-414; (2001), http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriSery/site/en.com2001_0366en01.pdf, Commission of the European Communities, Retrieved September 20, 2007, from; Dahlsrud, A., How corporate social responsibility is defined: An analysis of 37 definitions (2006) Corporate Social Responsibility and Environmental Management, 15, pp. 1-13; Denzin, N.K., Lincoln, Y.S., (2008) Collecting and Interpreting Qualitative Materials, , 3rd Ed.

Results indicate that the effects of negative advertising on the sponsoring candidate's personal attributes depend on issue relevance. That is, participants gave the highest evaluations of the sponsoring candidate's personal attributes when exposed to positive advertising with low-relevance issues. When it comes to the sponsoring candidate's qualification attributes, participants were more likely to give higher evaluations when issue relevance was high regardless of the tone of the advertising. As would be expected, the emerging challenger encountered unintended consequences in terms of participants' likelihood of voting when employing negative advertising to attack the leading candidate. Participants exposed to negative ads were less likely to vote for the sponsoring candidate than those who were exposed to positive ads. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Abramowitz, A.I., A comparison of voting for U.S. Senator and Representative in 1978 (1980) American Political Science Review, 74 (3), pp. 633-640; Althaus, S.L., Kim, Y.M., Priming effects in complex information environments: Reassessing the impact of news discourse on presidential approval (2006) Journal of Politics, 68 (4), pp. 960-976; Ansolabehere, S.D., Iyengar, S., (1995) Going Negative: How Political Advertisements Shrink and Polarize the Electorate, , New York, NY: Free Press; Austin, E.W., Pinkleton, B.E., The relation between media content evaluations and political disaffection (1999) Mass Communication & Society, 2 (3), pp. 105-122; Bean, C., The election influence of party leader images in Australia and New Zealand (1993) Comparative Political Studies, 26 (1), pp. 111-132; Benoit, W.L., McHale, J.P., Candidates' personal qualities: Computer content analysis (2004) Presidential Candidate Images, pp. 49-63. , In K.

Box 882, Helsingborg, 251 08, Sweden","Coworkers have received remarkably little attention in research and in practice within the field of strategic communication. The heroic view of leadership has nourished a view of coworkers as passive recipients rather than active and influential communicators. The first aim of this article is to illuminate how coworkership can be described and understood from a communication perspective. A greater focus on coworkers in strategic communication research will give a better understanding of the complex relationship between communication and organizing as coworker interpretations and actions constitute an organization. A second aim is to discuss new challenges for communication professionals resulting from coworkership. When communication professionals also support coworker communication processes, they will be perceived as a natural part of basic organizational processes. This conceptual paper emanates from the CCO (Communication Constitutes Organizing) perspective as a general meta-theory. We argue that coworkers must be put in the limelight since changes in organizational life have resulted in new demands on coworker communication practices and skills - not only in relation to their manager, but also in relation to colleagues and in relation to their employer as ambassadors. The article concludes with a discussion about five challenges for communication professionals. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Alvesson, M., (2004) Knowledge Work and Knowledge-intensive Firms, , Oxford: Oxford University Press; Alvesson, M., Spicer, A., Theories of leadership (2010) Metaphors We Lead By: Understanding Leadership In the Real World, pp. 8-30. , In M.

Greenwood Ave., Tulsa, OK 74106, United States","This research examined the retrospective views of U.S. public diplomats on the bases of anti-American attitudes among people abroad. The study sought a better understanding of the most important causes of anti-Americanism through the first hand experiences of the men and women who have served on the frontlines of U.S. public diplomacy as strategic communications experts charged with enhancing U.S. relations with foreign publics. A factor analysis revealed four underlying dimensions of anti-Americanism, which were labeled Information, Culture, Policy, and Values. The public diplomats rated the Policy factor as the most important, followed by the Information factor, the Culture factor, and the Values factor. This empirical assessment of U.S. public diplomats' collective view helps to explain the dimensions of anti-Americanism from the perspective of an elite group and suggests future directions for U.S. public diplomacy and strategic communication. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Cattell, R.B., The scree test for the number of factors (1966) Multivariate Behavioral Research, 1 (2), pp. 245-276; Mitchell, K.A., Beard, F., (2009) Measuring Internet Dependence Among College Students: A Replication and Confirmatory Analysis, , as cited in, Paper presented at the 2009 Southwest SymposiumSouthwest Education Council for Journalism and Mass Communication, Arlington, TX; Chadha, K., Kavoori, A., McAdams, K., (2004) The Rise of Anti-Americanism in India: A Case Study, , August, Paper presented at the annual conference of the Association for Education in Journalism and Mass Communication in Toronto, Canada; Chiozza, G., (2009) Anti-Americanism and the American World Order, , Baltimore, MD: The Johns Hopkins University Press; Chiozza, G., A crisis like no other?

The ""projective hearing"" concept is introduced to capture this underrated ability that may explain why a strong delivery style is not the highway to effective leadership: what happens interactionally is probably more interesting. Projective hearing with reflexive responding allows for immediate responses in a variety of situations, acknowledges that signals have more influence than messages, and is rooted in daily interactional practices. It fits in with recent planning theory that stresses a flexible response in complex, dynamic environments. It is also linked to the question of how to motivate coworkers and to the media richness theory, stressing and explaining the value of face-to-face encounters. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Agarwal, R.D., (1982) Organization and Management, , New Delhi: Tata McGraw-Hill; Barge, J.K., Reflexivity and managerial practice (2004) Communication Monographs, 71 (1), pp. 70-96; Bhardwaj, K., (2008) Professional Communication, , New Delhi: I.K.

It explores the role of strategic communication in building and protecting corporate reputations, promoting organisational values, and in employee communication during structural change. The article uses these roles to support the view of scholars that in its best-practice role assisting organisations to re-build reputations after the global economic crisis, strategic communication can consolidate its value to senior management. The article theorises that the economic recovery presents an opportunity for a paradigm shift that would explicitly re-align strategic communication with the second and third management horizons to consolidate its value to dominant coalitions. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Alexander, D., Reframing leadership communication: Consequences for organisational leaders resulting from communication failure: An Australian case study (2006) Empowerment, Creativity and Innovation: Challenging Media and Communication in the 21st Century, , ANZCA and University of Adelaide; An, S.-K., Gower, K.K., How do the news media frame crises?

In the context of the European way of doing business with the typical dialogical stakeholder approach, strategic versus instrumental action and the reflective dimension of communication that has been found in Europe, the strategic orientation of European professionals is assessed. A so-called strategic orientation index was constructed consisting of the professional role enactment of communication managers, the use of inbound strategic activities, the use of strategies and plans and the use of evaluation and controlling tools in the organization. The results show that there is a considerable strategic orientation of communication professionals in Europe. Professionals in Northern and Eastern Europe score highest on the strategic orientation index. Western European professionals score significantly lower than their colleagues in the North and in the East. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Aarts, N., (2009) Een Gesprek Zonder Einde [A Never Ending Conversation], , Amsterdam: Vossiuspers; Aarts, N., van Woerkum, C., (2008) Strategische Communicatie [Strategic Communication], , Assen: Van Gorcum; Austin, E.W., Pinkleton, B.E., Dixon, A., Barriers to public relations program research (2000) Journal of Public Relations Research, 12, pp. 235-253; Bentele, G., New perspectives of public relations in Europe (2004) Public Relations and Communication Management In Europe, pp. 485-496. , B. van Ruler & D.

Eight of the roles were previously tested in public relations research, and a ninth, the role of strategist, was conceptualized for this study based on the work of Steyn (2002, 2007). Reliability analysis confirmed seven of the nine roles existed in South African communication practice: strategist, cultural interpreter, media relations, communication facilitator, expert prescriber, liaison, and process facilitator. However, factor analysis reduced data to four parsimonious roles: strategist, media specialist, liaison, and cultural interpreter. Statistically significant ANOVA findings showed the cultural interpreter role was most performed in government and the mining/industrial/manufacturing sectors. A synergistic worldview helped practitioners to better perform the cultural interpreter role. The findings showed that these roles were largely performed across different contexts, indicating that strategic communication can be viewed as a common denominator for all forms of communication practice. This research challenges the siloed study of communication practice in forms such as public relations, advertising, or government relations, and indicates that there is more common ground between communication practice in different settings than previously thought. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"(2008) About the ACA, , http://www.acasa.co.za/about.aspx, ACA, Website accessed on October 30, 2008 at; Aldoory, L., The standard white woman in public relations (2001) The Gender Challenge to Media, pp. 105-149. , In E.

The study also looks at how online social community sites played a critical role in converting inactive publics into active publics by enhancing individuals' (the stroller moms') knowledge and involvement to be engaged with active communication behavior of information seeking and protesting against the Korean government's decision on U.S. beef import. Strategic lessons for organizations (e.g., Korean government) and communicative entities, and new considerations for the Issues Process Model are also discussed. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Aldoory, L., Making health communications meaningful for women: Factors that influence involvement (2001) Journal of Public Relations Research, 13 (2), pp. 163-185; Arndt, J., May, F.E., The hypothesis of a dominance hierarchy of information sources (1981) Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science, 9 (4), pp. 337-351; Babbie, E., (2004) The Practice of Social Research (10th Ed.), , Wadsworth; Belmont, CA; Bayus, B.L., Word of mouth: The indirect effects of marketing efforts (1985) Journal of Advertising Research, 25 (3), pp. 31-39; Beck, U., (1992) Risk Society: Toward a New Modernity, , London: Sage; Bennett, L.W., (2001) News: The Politics of Illusions, , New York, NY: Addison Wesley Longman; Blumer, H., Collective behavior (1969) The Principles of Sociology, , In A.M.

This study aimed to analyze the impacts of the feminization of public relations, and whether this is benefiting women practitioners and the overall industry in Indonesia. This study sought to answer: (1) Does the public relations practitioner's gender influence his/her dominant role? And, (2) What are the impacts of the feminization of public relations in Indonesia? In answering these questions, in-depth interviews with 53 public relations practitioners and educators in Jakarta were conducted. Results show that indeed gender influences the Indonesian public relations practitioner's dominant role. Also, the impacts of the feminization of the public relations industry in Indonesia are: Degradation of the public relations profession; Appearance as a job prerequisite; Male practitioners regarded as gay; Encroachment; Low budget allocation; Low remuneration; and Sexual harassment in the workplace. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Arivia, G., (2006) Indonesia Outlook 2006 - Political: Feminism An Alternative to Women Under Patriarchy, , http://www.thejakartapost.com/Outlook2006/po104b.asp, Retrieved July 4, 2007, from; Blackburn, S., (2001) Women and The Nation, , http://www.insideindonesia.org-edit66-susan1.htm, Retrieved July 4, 2007, from; Kesehatan, D., (2008) Laporan Hasil Riset Kesehatan Dasar 2007, , http://www.docstoc.com/search/Laporan%20Hasil%20Riset%20Kesehatan%20Dasar%20%28RISKESDAS%29%20Nasional%202007, Retrieved July 1, 2010 from; Dozier, D., Breaking public relations' glass ceiling (1988) Public Relations Review, 14, pp. 6-14; Farrell, W., (2005) Why Men Earn More, , New York, NY: Amacom; Fröhlich, R., Feminine and feminist values in communication professions: Exceptional skills and expertise or 'friendliness trap'?

And yet, students continually believe their campus is safer than other campuses across the country. This study places rampage school shootings in the context of terrorism and examines campus safety campaigns through the lens of terror management theory. An analysis of sample campus safety campaign tactics demonstrates the potential for campus safety campaigns to actually decrease safety by spurring attacks on others as a protection mechanism. School violence and terror management literature is reviewed, the phenomenon of optimistic bias is described, and campus safety campaigns are analyzed to make recommendations for future research and campaign development. © 2010 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Armstrong, T.A., Webb, V., The school-based violence prevention planning program (2006) Journal of School Violence, 5 (4), pp. 79-97; Astor, R.A., Meyer, H.A., The conceptualization of violence-prone school subcontexts: Is the sum of the parts greater than the whole?

Thirteen PR agencies and 12 subject areas were analyzed. A formula was developed to pinpoint the successful PR elements in 575 published news items emanating from these press releases. The main elements underlying publication success were importance of the item, its novelty and its practical usefulness; text composition and timely transfer to the journalist; and original source of the item. Overall, the public information model had the higher average success rate. The study's ramifications for organizations' overall communication strategy are also discussed. © 2010 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Anderson, W., Lawrey, W., What factors influence control over work in the journalism/public relations dynamic?

Benoit's (1995, 1997) image repair theory is used to analyze Duke's strategy in 54 public statements, news releases, and documents. Additionally, 870 local newspaper stories about the Duke case from The News & Observer (n = 443) and The Herald Sun (n = 427) are analyzed by crisis stage. Results show that Duke initially relied most on simple denial and mortification to defend its athletes, and engaged in bolstering, corrective action, separation, and attacking one's accuser to defend the university's reputation. Findings suggest a new defense category: expression of disappointment, which is related to the concept of separation. Use of the strategy of attacking one's accuser was associated with the most positive local news coverage. © 2010 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"(2006) A Community of One, , http://www.dukenews.duke.edu/mmedia/pdf/communityofone.pdf, (April 17).

Students responded to hypothetical news stories. The results showed that students in a highly collectivistic culture had more anger, negative attitudes, and impressions toward the organization than students in a highly individualistic culture, when the organization used the individualistic-level strategy. The results suggest organizations may benefit by using a strategy in which they accept responsibilities for crises. © 2010 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Averill, J.R., (1982) Anger and aggression: An essay on emotion, , New York: Springer-Verlag; Avruch, K., Black, P., Conflict resolution in intercultural settings (2001) The conflict & culture: Reader, pp. 7-16. , In P.

In fact, there were only minor differences between the groups with regard to agreement, accuracy, and congruency in social media use. In terms of understanding, reporters noted they were more likely to work with practitioners who were using social media tools. Thus, although usage gaps did emerge, journalists and practitioners appear to have overall convergence and shared orientations in their understandings of the other's use of social media, and important implications of these orientations on organizations' strategic visions emerge. © 2010 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,"This research was funded by a grant from the Public Relations Society of America Foundation.

However, little research, especially in Europe, has been done so far exploring how NPOs are actually taking advantage of this. This study analyzes how charitable fundraising NPOs in Germany and Switzerland employ their Web sites for dialogic communication with donors and media. Results indicate that NPOs provide well-designed Web sites, yet, fail to engage publics in dialogue. New trends, such as Web 2.0, are still hardly taken into account. Whereas donor publics are often addressed, media are often neglected. © 2010 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Callison, C., Media relations and the Internet: How fortune 500 company websites assist journalists in news gathering (2003) Public Relations Review, 29 (1), pp. 29-41; Catalano, C.S., Megaphones to the Internet and the world: The role of blogs in corporate communication (2007) International Journal of Strategic Communication, 1 (4), pp. 247-262; Cooley, T., Interactive communication-public relations on the Web (1999) Public Relations Quarterly, 44 (2), pp. 41-42; Esrock, S.L., Leichty, G.B., Corporate world wide web pages: Serving the news media and other publics (1999) Journalism & Mass Communication Quarterly, 76 (3), pp. 456-467; Esrock, S.L., Leichty, G.B., Organization of corporate web pages: Publics and functions (2000) Public Relations Review, 26 (3), pp. 327-344; Flanagin, A.J., Metzger, M.J., Internet use in the contemporary media environment (2001) Human Communication Research, 27 (1), pp. 153-181; Goatman, A., Lewis, B.R., Charity E-volution?

The study used data from a telephone survey of 998 residents of a mid-sized city during early 2008 to examine the interaction among interpersonal communication, media use, interpersonal trust, perceptions of respondents' relationships with their political parties, civic and political participation, and confidence in government. Results indicated that interpersonal communication, new media use, and relationship with political parties were related to increases in civic and political participation. Strong relationships with parties were also related to increased confidence in government. Implications of the integration of OPR variables into social capital theory are discussed as well as implications of social capital theory and OPR for strategic communication. © 2010 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Beaudoin, C.E., Thorson, E., Social capital in rural and urban communities: Testing differences in media effects and models (2004) Journalism and Mass Communication Quarterly, 81 (2), pp. 378-399; Brady, H.E., Political participation (1999) Measures of political attitudes, pp. 737-801. , In J.

A difficult-to-explain-and-predict chaos theory has ensued as professional media have lost their monopoly of knowledge to an immense number of purveyors of seemingly infinite user-provided content traveling on inexpensive and easily accessible electronic channels of communication. Much of this content is ideological, refocusing responsibility on consumers. The only strategic public that can be identified with certainty is the general public during a time in which infinite numbers of volatile publics worldwide can form immediately and unpredictably and can act seemingly chaotically and with unforeseen power.

Valenti School of Communication, University of Houston, Houston, TX, United States","This article proposes a new concept about communication behaviors related to problem solving. Communicative action is epiphenomenal to problem solving: As problem solvers, members of a public use communication as an instrument to cope with their problematic life situations. A good theoretical description of the communicative features of problem solving, therefore, is critical to understanding the social phenomena related to the development and behavior of publics. In existing literature, however, communication behaviors are conceptualized mostly as acts of information acquisition with little regard to other communicative actions such as information transmission. In this article, we propose a new model, communicative action in problem solving, which encompasses broader aspects of communication behaviors related to a problematic life situation: information acquisition, information selection, and information transmission. We then test the reliability and validity of the new construct for one personal and two social problems. Finally, we discuss the theoretical and practical implications of the new concept for public relations research and practice. © 2010 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Asen, R., Seeking the ""counter"" in counterpublics (2000) Communication theory, 10, pp. 424-446; Bateson, G., (1972) Steps to an ecology of mind, , New York: Ballantine Books; Blumer, H., Collective behavior (1946) New outlines of the principles of sociology, pp. 167-222. , In A.

We intend to examine whether specific forms of correlations between supervisory communication and commitment to workgroup could be distinguished from each other at the individual or higher level of analysis. We present results from an individual, dyadic and group sample taken from a Malaysian organization. We relate the measures of supervisory communication and commitment to workgroup from individuals embedded in a specific workgroup to reflect individual communication with their immediate supervisor as possible antecedents for commitment to their workgroup. To examine this relationship, we follow Within and Between Analysis (WABA) statistical procedures proposed by Dansereau, Alutto, and Yammarino (1984). This procedure involves: (a) testing the total deviation scores for each variable presented within cell, or between cell scores known as WABA I; (b) testing the level of analysis that may underlie relationships among all variables taken two at a time, known as WABA II, and (c) testing the total correlation and component analysis through the combination of WABA I and WABA II. We find that the relationships between supervisory communication and commitment to workgroup are relevant for the whole group. The correlations between these two variables are interpreted as group differences where the individuals in a group are viewed as homogenized, and each workgroup is assigned one score on each variable. Implications of these findings are discussed. © 2010 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Allen, N.J., Meyer, J.P., The measurement and antecedents of affective, continuance and normative commitment to the organization (1990) Journal of Occupational Psychology, 63 (1), pp. 1-18; Allen, N.J., Meyer, J.P., Affective, continuance, and normative commitment to the organization: An examination of construct validity (1996) Journal of Vocational Behavior, 49 (3), pp. 252-276; Andrews, M.C., Kacmar, K.M., Confirmation and extension of the sources of feedback scale in service-based organizations (2001) Journal of Business Communication, 38 (2), pp. 206-226; Ansari, M.A., Lee, B.B., Aafaqi, R., LMX and work outcomes: The mediating role delegation in the Malaysian business context (2007) Academy of Management Proceedings, pp. 1-6; Ashkanasy, N.M., Leadership in the Asian century: Lessons from GLOBE (2002) International Journal of Organizational Behaviour, 5 (3), pp. 150-163; Asma, A., Lim, L., Cultural dimensions of Anglos, Australians and Malaysian (2001) Malaysian Management Review, 36 (2), pp. 1-17; Bochner, S., Cross-cultural differences in the self concept: A test of Hofstede7rsquo;s individualism/collectivism distinction (1994) Journal of Cross-Cultural Psychology, 25 (2), pp. 273-283; Cashman, D., Dansereau, F., Graen, G., Haga, W.J., Organizational understructure and leadership: A longitudinal investigation of the managerial role-making process (1976) Organizational Behavior and Human Performance, 15 (2), pp. 278-296; Castro, S.L., Data analytic methods for the analysis of multilevel questions: A comparison of interclass correlation coefficients, rwg(j), hierarchical linear modeling, within and between analysis and random group resampling (2002) Leadership Quarterly, 13 (1), pp. 69-93; Chan, C.C.A., Pearson, C.A.L., Comparison of Managerial work goals among Bruneian, Malaysian and Singaporean managers (2002) Journal of Management Development, 21 (7), pp. 545-556; Cogliser, C.C., Schriesheim, C.A., Exploring work unit context and leader-member exchange: A multi-level perspective (2000) Journal of Organizational Behavior, 21 (5), pp. 487-511; Dansereau, F., A dyadic approach to leadership: Creating and nurturing this approach under fire (1995) Leadership Quarterly, 6 (4), pp. 479-490; Dansereau, F., Alutto, J.A., Yammarino, F.J., (1984) Theory testing in organizational behavior: The varient approach, , Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey: Prentice-Hall; Dansereau, F., Graen, G., Haga, W.J., A vertical dyad linkage approach to leadership within formal organizations: A longitudinal investigation of the role making process (1975) Organizational Behavior and Human Performance, 13 (1), pp. 46-78; Dansereau, F., Markham, S.E., Superior-subordinate communication (1987) Handbook of organizational communication, pp. 343-388. , In F.

This paper defines an emergent communication strategy as a communication construct derived from the interaction between reader/hearer response, situated context, and discursive patterns. The definition is based on the work of Mintzberg (1988) on emergent business strategies, Jeffrey Goldstein (1999) on emergence in organizational complexity theory, and other communication theorists (e.g., Boden, 1994; Taylor & Van Every, 2000), who take a constructionist view of organizations. Additionally, the paper draws from Burke (1945, 1955, 1968) to examine reader response, Burke (1955) and ethnography of communication (Carbaugh, 2008; Gumperz & Hymes, 1972; Hymes, 1962; Philipsen, 1992) to explicate situated context, and discourse analysis to derive discursive patterns. To illustrate emergent communication strategies, a sample analysis of a letter issued in response to TA unionization at University of Washington is provided. © 2010 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Alvesson, M., Karreman, D., Varieties of discourse: On the study of organizations through discourse analysis (2000) Human Relations, 53, pp. 1207-1226; Armstrong, J., West, A., Look at the numbers again (2000) The Daily, p. 11. , [Letter to the editor].

This article presents a grounded approach to understanding and managing the rhetorical nature of recall announcements as a discourse genre for strategic communication. After brief discussion of genre theory applied to strategic communication, the essay places recall messages in the context of the relevant research literature. An analysis of product recall messages reveals the genre to be comprised of fear-appeal elements, stylistic choices related to language intensity, and pragmatic concerns for projecting an organizational image focused on quality. The essay concludes with implications for theory, practice, and future research. © 2010 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Austin, J.L., (1975) How to do things with words, , (2nd ed.).

Analyses are required that see corporate legitimacy also in relation to society's constitution. Legitimating notions regulate the interrelation between organization and society, and set the premises for strategic communication. As globalizing organizations increasingly face conflicting perceptions of legitimacy, new challenges to strategic communication arise. Different types of societal constitution breed different legitimating corporate settings. Taking as the empirical example the transnational Scandinavian dairy group Arla Foods, three fundamentally different legitimacy conflicts and their interplay with strategic communication are analyzed: between Western and Middle-East values; between former and present ideals as society changes from solid to fluid modernity; and between the neighboring Scandinavian welfare states of Sweden and Denmark. By relating legitimating notions to society's constitution and forms of social coordination generic patterns are identified in the multitudinous diversity of legitimacy conflicts within which global organizations are embedded. © 2010 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Baraldi, C., New forms of intercultural communication in a globalized world (2006) The International Communication Gazette, 68 (1), pp. 53-69; Bigum, J., Dear employee at Arla Foods (2003) Nyt i noter, , Arla Foods, Århus: 1; Børsting, M., Klingsey, M., (2005) Ytringsfrihed: DF: Fogh bør mødes med ambassadører [Freedom of expression: DF: Fogh ought to meet with ambassadors], p. 2. , Information, Copenhagen, (28.12.2005); Campbell, J.L., Hall, J.A., Pedersen, O.K., (2006) National identity and the varieties of capitalism: The Danish experience, , Montreal: McGill-Queen's University Press; Gagalon, E., Karaca, S., Legitimacy across national borders.
