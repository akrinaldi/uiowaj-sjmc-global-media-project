This interplay has historical antecedents and contemporary applications. Conflicts involving Indigenous Peoples and colonizers appear in literary representations (e.g. Shakespeare’s The Tempest), and contests between communities and cultures in historical, political and social settings. Amnesty International reports Indigenous Peoples’ realities and efforts to lobby for social justice. One effort is in becoming visible and seeking meaningful recognition examined in media coverage of the First Peoples’ holiday in Trinidad and Tobago, and resonates in conflicts reported elsewhere between Indigenous Peoples and others. Using media reports, interviews and other texts, this article employs a critical discourse studies approach to trace narrative elements and themes of communication, culture and conflict interplay, and interpret the contested expression and meaning of these texts to describe, understand, explain and construct a theoretical and applied account of resistance against unequal treatment. © The Author(s) 2020.","Amerindian; Caribbean; case study; communication; critical discourse studies; culture; Indigenous Peoples; intercultural conflict; interview; intractable media; reparation; Santa Rosa; social justice; textual analysis; Trinidad and Tobago",,,,,,,,,"Indigenous Peoples, , https://www.amnesty.org/en/what-we-do/indigenous-peoples/; Azar, E., (1990) The Management of Protracted Social Conflict: Theory and Cases, , Aldershot, Dartmouth; Baya, S.Y., (2009) Communication and conflict: A case study of indigenous mechanisms of conflict resolution among the Mijikenda, , University of Nairobi, Nairobi, Kenya, Master’s Thesis; Catalans declare independence as Madrid imposes direct rule (2017) BBC, , https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-41780116, 27, October; Bharath Hernandez, R., (2017) On becoming visible towards meaningful recognition, ‘not with spear, bow and arrow’ but with ‘pen and advocacy’, , 14, September, Arima, Trinidad, Santa Rosa First Peoples Community; Bharath Hernandez, R., Forte, M.C., ‘In this place where I was chief’: History and ritual in the maintenance and retrieval of traditions in the Carib community of Arima Trinidad (2006) Indigenous Resurgence in the Contemporary Caribbean, pp. 107-131. , Forte M.C., (ed), New York, Peter Lang, In:, (ed; First peoples one-off holiday Trinidad and Tobago (2017) Blue Edition, , https://theblueedition.com/2020/04/21/the-first-people-of-trinidad/, 12, October; Boodram, K., Christopher Columbus monument defaced (2017) Express, p. 9. , 11, October, p; Calfas, J., Here are the cities that celebrate Indigenous Peoples’ day instead of Columbus day (2017) Time, , http://time.com/4968067/indigenous-peoples-day-columbus-day-cities/, 8, October; Columbus day shines light on growing movement to replace holiday (2017) CBS, , https://www.cbsnews.com/news/columbus-day-2017-movement-holiday-indigenous-peoples-day/, 9, October; Clark, H.H., Brennan, S.E., Grounding in communication (1991) Perspectives on Socially Shared Cognition, pp. 127-149. , Resnick L.B., Levine J.M., Teasley S.D., (eds), Washington, DC, American Psychological Association, In:, (eds; Coleman, P.T., Conflict intelligence and systemic wisdom: Meta-competencies for engaging conflict in a complex, dynamic world (2018) Negotiation Journal, 34 (1), pp. 8-35; Enns Fehr, N., (2010) Locating Canada’s truth and reconciliation commission in global trends, , https://www.beyondintractability.org/casestudy/fehr-locating; Euwema, M.C., Van Emmerik, H.I., Intercultural competencies and conglomerated conflict behaviors in intercultural conflicts (2007) International Journal of Intercultural Relations, 31 (4), pp. 427-441; Euwema, M.C., Van De Vliert, E., Bakker, A.B., Substantive and relational effectiveness of organizational conflict behavior (2003) International Journal of Conflict Management, 14, pp. 119-139; (2019), Protecting intellectual property and the environmental rights of Indigenous Peoples Trinidad and Tobago.

Critical discourse analysis, the verbal irony principle and semi-structured interviews were employed to compare participants from mainland China and Hong Kong, including opinion leaders and casual users. This research suggests a three-stage analytical framework that clearly emphasizes the act of rhetorical discourse and the practice of self-censorship. As such, it reveals citizens’ intrinsic motivation related to self-efficacy, resistance or empowerment. This research argues that dissidents’ shared knowledge and ideology are structurally represented in the ‘binary opposition’ mode of rhetorical discourse, concerning the discursive construction of Hong Kong identity. The proliferation of rhetorical discourse, evolving shoulder to shoulder with Internet self-censorship, results from the complexity of politics, history and digital technology development within China. © The Author(s) 2020.","China; critical discourse analysis; Hong Kong Election; political rhetoric; self-censorship",,,,,,"Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China, MOE: 19YJC860027","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship and/or publication of this article: This research has been supported by the Humanities and Social Sciences Youth Foundation of the Ministry of Education of China (Grant No. 19YJC860027).",,"Anderson, R., Cissna, K.N., Clune, M.K., The rhetoric of public dialogue (2003) Communication Research Trends, 22 (1), pp. 3-37; Attardo, S., Irony markers and functions: Towards a goal-oriented theory of irony and its processing (2000) Rask, 12 (1), pp. 3-20; Bar-Tal, D., Self-censorship as a socio-political-psychological phenomenon: Conception and research (2017) Political Psychology, 38, pp. 37-65; Burgers, C., van Mulken, M., Schellens, P.J., Finding irony: An introduction of the verbal irony procedure (VIP) (2011) Metaphor and Symbol, 26 (3), pp. 186-205; Chun, W.H.K., (2006) Control and Freedom: Power and Paranoia in the Age of Fiber Optics, , Boston, MA, The MIT Press, (illustrated edition; Cook, P., Heilmann, C., Two types of self-censorship: Public and private (2013) Political Studies, 61 (1), pp. 178-196; Eisterhold, J., Attardo, S., Boxer, D., Reactions to irony in discourse: Evidence for the least disruption principle (2006) Journal of Pragmatics, 38 (8), pp. 1239-1256; Festenstein, M., Self-censorship for democrats (2018) European Journal of Political Theory, 17 (3), pp. 324-342; Gibbs, R.W., Irony is talk among friends (2000) Metaphor and Symbol, 15 (2), pp. 5-27; Hayes, A.F., Scheufele, D.A., Huge, E.M., Nonparticipation as self-censorship: Public observable political activity in a polarized opinion climate (2006) Political Behavior, 28, pp. 259-283; Horton, J., Self-censorship (2011) Res Publica, 17, pp. 91-106; Jiang, Y., ‘Reversed agenda-setting effects’ in China case studies of Weibo trending topics and the effects on state-owned media in China (2014) Journal of International Communication, 20 (2), pp. 168-183; King, G., Pan, J., Roberts, M., How censorship in China allows government criticism but silences collective expression (2013) American Political Science Review, 107 (2), pp. 1-18; Kotthoff, H., Responding to irony in different context: On cognition in conversation (2003) Journal of Pragmatics, 35 (9), pp. 1387-1411; Lagerkvist, J., (2010) After the Internet, Before Democracy: Competing Norms in Chinese Media and Society, , New York, Peter Lang; Lam, T., Freedom Hi: When the tear gas clears, Hong Kong’s masses of protesters remain strong.

Following a terminological insight into the linguistic and cognitive complexities of the notion, we proceed to a semantic analysis of press articles in major Anglo-Saxon newspapers, focusing on the explanation strategies used by the media to simplify their presentation. We show that in the mediation process, biopesticides (and co-referent terms) are systematically described as being environmentally friendly, and opposed to chemical pesticides, consistently shown to be detrimental to the environment. We hypothesize that this simplistic binary framing is exploited by journalists as it is easy to understand in a context of agroecological transition and commonly shared distrust for chemical pesticides. In that respect, it proves to be adequate for purposes of explanation and simplification. However, by outlining this discursive process based on duality, we aim to draw attention to the potential misconceptions of plant protection issues in general, and biopesticides in particular.

Drawing on the notions of entextualization and resemiotization, I will trace and analyse the patterned ways in which pre-existing linguistic resources are creatively reworked by the app to achieve new identity-making purposes. Situating the changes of the field of healthcare in China within a worldwide shift towards neoliberal ideologies and practices, I will also briefly discuss how the emergence of such new social space in digital settings may impact the production and communication of health knowledge and services in China. © The Author(s) 2020.","Chinese Internet vernacular; doctors; Mainland China; popular science article; professional identity; sociolinguistic resources",,,,,,,,,"Bailey, B., Heteroglossia (2012) The Routledge Handbook of Multilingualism, pp. 499-507. , Martin-Jones M., Blackledge A., Creese A., (eds), New York, Routledge, In:, (eds; Bakhtin, M.M., (1981) The Dialogic Imagination: Four Essays, , Austin, TX; London, University of Texas Press; Bauman, R., Briggs, C.L., Poetics and performances as critical perspectives on language and social life (1990) Annual Review of Anthropology, 19, pp. 59-88; Bian, Q., Gao, B., From watching to action: Emotion, micro-blogging and reason (2012) Journalism & Communication, 19 (6), pp. 10-17. , [,]; Billig, M., (1999) Freudian Repression: Conversation Creating the Unconscious, , Cambridge, Cambridge University Press; Blommaert, J., Backus, A., Superdiverse repertoires and the individual (2013) Multilingualism and Multimodality: Current Challenges for Educational Studies, pp. 11-32. , de Saint-Georges I., Weber J., (eds), Rotterdam, Sense Publishers, In:, (eds; Blommaert, J., Varis, P., (2015) Enoughness, accent and light communities: Essays on contemporary identities, , https://research.tilburguniversity.edu/en/publications/enoughness-accent-and-light-communities-essays-on-contemporary-id, (Tilburg papers cultural studies, paper no. 139; Blommaert, J., Lu, Y., Li, K., From the self to the selfie: Draft chapter (2019) Contributions to Identity: Identity in Non-Western Contexts, , https://alternative-democracy-research.org/2019/02/19/from-the-self-to-the-selfie/, Byron A., Fons V., (eds), accessed 22 February 2019, In:, (eds; Bolander, B., Locher, M., Doing sociolinguistic research on computer-mediated data: A review of four methodological issues (2014) Discourse, Context & Media, 3, pp. 14-26; Bourdieu, P., The economics of linguistic exchanges (1977) Social Science Information, 16 (6), pp. 645-668; Bray, D., (2005) Social Space and Governance in Urban China: The Danwei System from Origins to Reform, , Stanford, CA, Stanford University Press; Breiner, S.J., Sexuality in traditional China: Its relationship to child abuse (1992) Child Psychiatry and Human Development, 23 (2), pp. 53-67; Bucholtz, M., Hall, K., Identity and interaction: A sociocultural linguistic approach (2005) Discourse Studies, 7 (4-5), pp. 585-614; Bullough, V.L., Masturbation: A historical overview (2002) Journal of Psychology and Human Sexuality, (14-3), pp. 17-33; Chen, M., (1998) ‘I am an animal!’: Lexical reappropriation, performativity, and queer, pp. 128-140. , Engendering communication: Proceedings from the fifth Berkeley women and language conference, Berkeley, CA, 24–26 April, Berkeley, CA, University of California, In; (2016) ‘Healthy China 2030’ plan outline‘2030’, , http://www.gov.cn/zhengce/2016-10/25/content_5124174.htm, [,] 健康中国 规划纲要; De Fina, A., Schiffrin, D., Bamberg, M., (2006) Discourse and Identity, , Cambridge, Cambridge University Press; De Seta, G., ‘Meng?

A corpus of 515 headlines produced between May and June 2017 is examined using an interdisciplinary critical discourse analytic framework. Analysis is conducted at two levels: a textual level concerned with the analysis of the semantic and syntactic aspects of headlines and a socio-cognitive level informed by insights from Van Dijk’s ideological square concept and his mental model theory and Laclau and Mouffe’s discourse theory.

Existing studies of YouTube review work have focused on how vloggers manage conflicting neoliberal identity discourses such as ‘authenticity’, ‘being entertaining’ and ‘selling’. I argue that this focus has been at the expense of the communicative work involved in constructing products in reviews, and I suggest that identity issues should be conceptually expanded through a much broader focus on communicative action and conventions of practice. In order to achieve a first step in this expansion, my analysis focusses on reviewers’ sensorial engagement with objects and explores the communicative processes through which they symbolically transform products into enlivened, sensorially rich phenomena. I argue that these communicative strategies are important for situating neoliberal discourses within ‘mundane’ actions of description and in broader cultural practices of reviewing. © The Author(s) 2020.","Accountability; computer-mediated communication; discourse analysis; gestures; interactional sociology; multimodality; product reviews; sense work; sociology of the senses; YouTube",,,,,,,,,"Alač, M., We like to talk about smell: A worldly take on language, sensory experience, and the Internet (2017) Semiotica, 2017 (215), pp. 143-192; Alexander, V.D., Blank, G., Hale, S.A., Digital traces of distinction?

It was found that (1) In the text dimension, lexicon features regarding vocabulary volume, vocabulary highlighting, readability and sentiment are unique to MD&As; (2) the genre of MD&As corresponds to a rhetorical structure of 3 moves and 10 steps; (3) the professional practice of MD&As is represented by three types of interdiscursivity, that is, shifting, mixing and embedding; (4) the professional culture of MD&As is embodied through identity enculturation, human-oriented value, cooperation awareness and self-serving manner.

The framework is demonstrated in being applied to an examination of the construal of putative addressee positioning in a selection of mass media texts concerned with the Israeli military’s invasion of Gaza in 2014. The framework is novel in the way in which it mobilises the account of the options for dialogistic positioning offered by the appraisal-framework literature, combined with some insights from Toulmin’s notion of the argumentative ‘warrant’. Conclusions are offered as to how such analyses of the readers being ‘written into the text’ can extend insights into the rhetorical workings of such texts and their ideological functionality in naturalising particular value positions. © The Author(s) 2020.","appraisal; argumentation; persona; readership; stance",,,,,,,,,"Bakhtin, M., The problem of speech genres (1986) Speech Genres and Other Late Essays, pp. 60-103. , Emerson C., Holquist M., (eds), Austin, TX, University of Texas Press, In:, (eds; Becker, A., Modality and ENGAGEMENT in British and German TV interviews (2009) Contrastive Pragmatics - Special Issue of Languages in Contrast, 9 (1), pp. 5-22; Bekalu, M.A., Presupposition in news discourse (2006) Discourse & Society, 17 (2), pp. 147-172; Caldwell, D.L., Affiliating with rap music: Political rap or gangsta rap?

Most research to date has considered how protest movements, as preexistent entities, use such social media to communicate with stakeholders, but little, if any research, has considered how a protest movement is constituted in and through communication. Using the Montreal School’s ventriloquial approach to communication and using YouTube video footage of the gilets jaunes – a contemporary French protest movement – in action, the purpose of this article is to explicate how a protest movement that resists the state’s authority is constituted in and through a textual artifact (a video clip on YouTube). Findings indicate that the protest movement is not only discursively constructed through the commentary that accompanies the video, but it is also constituted by non-human actants such as space, buildings and clothing. The protest movement mobilizes networks of human and non-human actants that invoke a moral authority that resists legally authorized state-sponsored networks which are also made up of human and non-human actants. © The Author(s) 2020.","Actor Network Theory; authority; Montreal School; socio-materiality; ventriloquism; yellow vest (gilet jaune)",,,,,,,,,"Barad, K., Posthumanist performativity: Toward an understanding of how matter comes to matter (2003) Signs: Journal of Women in Culture and Society, 28 (3), pp. 801-831; Bencherki, N., Ethnomethodology and the Montreal School (2014) Méthodes de recherche sur l’information et la communication (Research Methods Concerning Information and Communication), pp. 141-166. , Bourdeloie H., Douyère D., (eds), Paris, Mare & Martin, [,].

The State has failed in an attempt to establish policies that support truth, justice and reparation as it has been recalled by United Nations experts to the Government of Spain, and the reports and documentaries have become vehicles to capture and recover memories. Our objective is to analyze how this collective awareness has been realized and the contribution of reports and documentaries. Our results show that the Spanish television channels silence the Francoist context to depict the thefts as the product of economical mobs focused on child trafficking.

I use the Discourse Historical Approach to reveal and compare the discursive strategies that the official Turkish news agency has used as part of its public diplomacy efforts in their mass communication efforts regarding Syrian refugees during the last 8 years. The results reveal how a humanitarian issue such as the plight of refugees might be employed to establish a government’s political position, affirm its involvement and influence public opinion about a conflict that exceeds national boundaries and has turned into a challenge for international dominance involving world superpowers. The topics highlighted in the Turkish news reports and the argumentations that these reports put forward reveal that the Turkish government is highly critical of the international community, especially Western powers, for not fulfilling their humanitarian responsibilities. This specific criticism from Turkey regarding its outsized role in hosting refugees has become a leverage point to claim a place in the decision table about the future of Syria. © The Author(s) 2019.","Anadolu Agency; critical discourse analysis; Discourse Historical Approach; news agencies; news releases; public diplomacy; Syrian refugees; Turkey",,,,,,,,,"(2018) History of Anadolu Agency from its foundation to the present, , https://www.aa.com.tr/en/p/history, accessed 2 October 2018; Anholt, S., Hildreth, J., Let freedom and cash registers ring: America as a brand (2005) Place Branding, 1 (2), pp. 164-172; Asante, M.K., (2014) Facing South to Africa: Toward an Afrocentric Critical Orientation, , Lanham, MD, Lexington Books; Beaumont, P., Smith, H., Erdoğan: I’ll let Syrian refugees leave Turkey for west unless safe zone set up (2019) The Guardian, , https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/sep/05/erdogan-ill-let-syrian-refugees-leave-turkey-for-west-unless-safe-zone-set-up, 5, September, accessed 30 October; Bigo, D., Security and immigration: Toward a critique of the governmentality of unease (2002) Alternatives: Global, Local, Political, 27 (1), pp. 63-92; Chavez, L.R., (2001) Covering Immigration: Popular Images and the Politics of a Nation, , Berkeley, CA, University of California Press; Cisneros, J.D., Contaminated communities: The metaphor of ‘immigrant as pollutant’ in media representations of immigration (2008) Rhetoric and Public Affairs, 11, pp. 569-601; Dimitrova, D.V., Ozdora-Aksak, E., Connolly-Ahern, C., On the border of the Syrian refugee crisis: Views from two different cultural perspectives (2018) American Behavioral Scientist, 62 (4), pp. 532-546; Fairclough, N., (1989) Language and Power, , London, Longman; Fairclough, N., (1995) Media Discourse, , London, Edward Arnold; Fairclough, N., Wodak, R., Critical discourse analysis (1997) Discourse Studies: A Multidisciplinary Introduction, pp. 258-284. , Van Dijk T., (ed), London, SAGE, In:, (ed; Fitzgerald, J., Curtis, K.A., Corliss, C.L., Anxious publics worries about crime and immigration (2012) Comparative Political Studies, 45 (4), pp. 477-506; Gabrielatos, C., Baker, P., Fleeing, sneaking, flooding: A corpus analysis of discursive constructions of refugees and asylum seekers in the UK press 1996- 2005 (2008) Journal of English Linguistics, 36 (1), pp. 5-38; Grunig, J.E., Public relations and international affairs: Effects, ethics and responsibility (1993) Journal of International Affairs, 47 (1), pp. 137-162; Guilfoyle, A., Hancock, P., Discourses and refugees’ social inclusion: Introduction to method and issues (2009) Tamara: Journal of Critical Organization Inquiry, 8 (1-2), pp. 123-132; Hercowitz-Amir, A., Raijman, R., Davidov, E., Host or hostile?

I discuss how the opinion articles and editorial collected from The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, USA Today and New York Post constructed the social reality (the Iran nuclear programme and deal) differently, as a result of their differing political ideologies, and sought to influence American foreign policy in line with their interests. Integrating securitisation theory with CDS, I investigated three types of discursive strategies (representational, dialogical and argumentative strategies) employed by these articles and discussed their contribution to the construction of elements of securitisation. The findings showed that American newspapers’ commentary articles systematically securitised Iran (but sometimes desecuritised its nuclear programme).1 © The Author(s) 2019.","American newspapers; constructivism;

It emphasises the discursive construction of governmental paternalism that forms the dominant ideological disposition of China Daily’s (CD) coverage. The results reveal how Chinese official English newspapers facilitate the government’s dissemination of paternalistic discourse in the news of a large population of Chinese Muslims over the period. The investigation combines topic modelling with topos analysis to identify topics and topoi and to exhibit the ideology through the corpus compiled with CD’s news about Chinese Muslims. Our findings both uncover the extent to which CD is used to promote paternalistic discourse by topic and reveal how paternalism is constructed by topoi. CD can be seen to strongly legitimise the paternalistic framework corresponding with the government’s promotion of social development and security in the region.

They most likely communicate their suicidal thoughts to family members or close friends, whose responses may sound unhelpful and/or dismissive, thus reinforcing suicidal ideation. This national emergency has been tackled via a social media campaign, #YouCan Talk, launched by a government-supported digital platform, BeyondBlue. This article adopts a multimodal discourse analysis approach to investigate how peer support is encouraged and articulated in the context of mental health discourse for suicide prevention. The two case studies selected for analysis from the BeyondBlue platform are (1) the #YouCanTalk social media campaign, designed to teach carers to identify severe depression and effectively respond to suicide warning signs and (2) a sample of posts from a thread for peer support in a monitored online forum devoted to help carers who seek peer advice. Unlike previous research, the article focuses on how pronouns and verbs index interpersonal relations in a systemic-functional perspective as well as other multimodal resources, such as visuals, layout and hyperlinking, to understand how identities are entextualised by both professional health providers and peer carers in digital platforms that address mental health issues. © The Author(s) 2019.","Discourse in digital governmental mental health platforms; distance; identity; mental health discourse; multimodal discourse analysis; peer support in digital environments; suicide",,,,,,,,,"Androutsopoulos, J., Moments of sharing: Entextualization and linguistic repertoires in social networking (2014) The Pragmatics of Textual Participation in the Social Media, 73, pp. 4-18. , Bou-Franch P., Blitvitch P.G., (eds), In:, (eds), (Special Issue of Journal of Pragmatics; Baldry, A., Thibault, P., (2006) Multimodal Transcription and Text Analysis, , London, Equinox; Baldry, A., Thibault, P., Applications of multimodal concordances (2008) Hermes, 41, pp. 11-41; Barak, A., Emotional support and suicide prevention through the Internet: A field project report (2007) Computers in Human Behavior, 23, pp. 971-984; Barak, A., Miron, O., Writing characteristics of suicidal people on the Internet: A psychological investigation of emerging social environments (2005) Suicide and Life-Threatening Behaviour, 35, pp. 507-524; Bathje, G., Pryor, J., The relationships of public and self-stigma to seeking mental health services (2011) Journal of Mental Health Counseling, 33 (2), pp. 161-176; Bernstein, B., Codes, modalities and the process of cultural reproduction: A model (1981) Language and Society, 10, pp. 327-363; Bondi, M., Cacchiani, S., Mazzi, A., (2015) Discourse in and through the Media: Recontextualizing and Reconceptualizing Expert Discourse, , Newcastle upon Tyne, Cambridge Scholars Publishing, (eds; Calsamiglia, H., van Dijk, T.A., Popularization discourse and knowledge about the genome (2004) Discourse & Society, 15 (4), pp. 369-389; Chafe, W., Integration and involvement in speaking, writing, and oral literature (1982) Spoken and Written Language: Exploring Orality and Literacy, pp. 35-53. , Tannen D., (ed), Norwood, NJ, Ablex, In:, (ed; Church, K., de Oliveria, R., (2013) What’s up with WhatsApp?

This study seeks to further that line of inquiry by investigating politeness in Nigerian news-based virtual communities. Taking an etic interpretive analytical approach which relies on the facework and relational-work paradigms, it studies virtual communities generated by four Nigerian online newspapers purposively sampled to represent the Nigerian geo-political zones and political ideologies between 2015 and 2018. Given the relative newness of the virtual community in Africa as well as its significant impacts on socio-political activities and attitudes to democracy and governance, the research will contribute significantly to the exploration of online communicative behaviour in the African humanities. © The Author(s) 2019.","Computer-mediated communication;

Although it is widely acknowledged that employees rarely control decisions in these settings, little is known about the interactional resources that employees and managers draw upon when negotiating consensus about which initiatives to pursue in the future.

Although it is widely acknowledged that employees rarely control decisions in these settings, little is known about the interactional resources that employees and managers draw upon when negotiating consensus about which initiatives to pursue in the future.

Evidence emerged of positive self-presentation and negative other representation through denials of prejudice, discursive de-racialisation and the use of war metaphors and lexis referencing legality, criminality and the collective. However, the control over this forum was its defining feature which appeared to propagate an anti-immigration stance and normalise the aforementioned lexis. This control was evident through the selection and placement of contributors, the influence of cognitively central participants, the foregrounding of Trump’s rhetoric, topic selection, protection offered to in-group members and topicalisation which supported the in-group and served to vilify the views and identity of the out-group. All of which led to the creation of a closed community devoid of alternatives. © The Author(s) 2019.","Brexit; control; critical discourse analysis; Nigel Farage; prejudice; social influence; socio-cognitive approach;

This study investigates how Chinese companies respond to this challenge by analyzing the representations of occupational fatalities and injuries in 92 CSR reports from 37 Chinese Fortune 500 companies. A move-step analysis was performed on one part of the CSR report, which is the section providing information on occupational incidents. It was found that the negative information was typically disclosed via four rhetorical moves, which are ‘preparing the reader’, ‘delivering the bad news’, ‘mitigating the bad news’ and ‘reassuring the reader’. Communicating bad news through the four moves helps manage the reader’s perception of the reporting company and its CSR performance.

As public understanding of scientific issues is partly influenced by news reporting, this article is the first to study how the British press has discussed nitrogen pollution. A corpus-assisted frame analysis of newspaper articles (1984–2018) highlighted five frames: Activism, where environmental charities and organizations are portrayed as having an active role in fighting pollution; Government Responsibility, where privatization is presented as central and positioned as one of the main causes of pollution; Industry Responsibility, in which industries’ actions are depicted as causing pollution to increase; Pollutions as Politics, in which pollution is not discussed as a problem to be solved but rather as a means to increase votes; and Risk, where readers are warned about the possible effects of pollution on human health, flora and fauna. The analysis also points to the absence of named scientists and sources with the coverage being dominated by politicians. © The Author(s) 2019.","Ammonia; British press; corpus-assisted frame analysis; environmental issues; framing; nitrates; nitrogen pollution",,,,,,,"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This research was funded by the N8 Agri Food Programme’s Project Resources & Seed Corn Funding as part of the project: The Language of Nitrogen: Why Is Public Understanding of the Environmental Challenges Caused by Nitrogen From Agriculture So Low? conducted at the Lancaster Environment Centre, Lancaster University.",,"Akerlof, K., DeBono, R., Berry, P., Public perceptions of climate change as a human health risk: Surveys of the United States, Canada and Malta (2010) International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health, 7 (6), pp. 2559-2606; Atanasova, D., Moving society to a sustainable future: The framing of sustainability in a constructive media outlet (2019) Environmental Communication, 13 (5), pp. 700-711; Atanasova, D., Koteyko, N., Brown, B., Representations of mental health and arts participation in the national and local British press, 2007–2015 (2017) Health, 23 (1), pp. 3-20; Baker, P., (2006) Using Corpora in Discourse Analysis, , London; New York, Continuum; Baker, P., Gabrielatos, C., McEnery, A., (2013) Discourse Analysis and Media Attitudes: The Representation of Islam in the British Press, , Cambridge, Cambridge University Press; Bednarek, M., An increasingly familiar tragedy’: Evaluative collocation and conflation (2008) Functions of Language, 15 (1), pp. 7-34; Bednarek, M., Caple, H., (2017) The Discourse of News Values.

Despite the outcome, research and media alike concluded that the main pro-independence campaign, Yes Scotland (YS), outdid the main pro-union campaign, Better Together (BT), in the online battle. This article addresses this discrepancy by exploring how YS and BT used social media affordances in order to legitimize their own and de-legitimize their opponents’ positions. The material consists of multimodal tweets published by YS and BT in the run-up to the referendum. The article employs a model for multimodal legitimation that takes into consideration the construction of authority, moral evaluation and the construction and justifications of means and goals. The findings show that both campaigns made extensive use of de-legitimating strategies, although YS was more balanced. The article also shows that the campaigns’ communicative choices had implications for the construction and justification of goals and means, with YS running a more visionary campaign than BT. © The Author(s) 2020.","Labour; nationalism; referendum; Scotland; Scottish National Party; social media; Twitter; unionism",,,,,,,,,"Baxter, G., Marcella, R., Does Scotland ‘like’ this?

Applied CA has become especially beneficial for informing areas of practice such as health, social care and education, and is an accepted form of research evidence in the scientific rhetoric. There are different ways of undertaking applied CA, with different foci and goals. In this article, we articulate one way of conducting applied CA, that is especially pertinent for practitioners working in different fields. We conceptualise this as Reflective Interventionist CA (RICA). We argue that this approach to applied CA is important because of its emphasis on the reflective stance that is valuable to an understanding of research data, its commitment to collaboration with practitioners, and its inductive style. In this paper, we outline the core premises and benefits of this approach and offer empirical examples to support our argument. To conclude, we consider the implications for evidence-based practice. © The Author(s) 2020.","Applied; collaboration; conversation analysis; evidence; practitioner; reflection",,,,,,,,,"Antaki, C., Six kinds of applied conversation analysis (2011) Applied conversation analysis: intervention and change in institutional talk, pp. 1-14. , Antaki C., (ed), Hampshire, Palgrave MacMillan, In:, (ed; Atkinson, J.M., Drew, P., (1979) Order In Court: The Organization of Verbal Interaction in Judicial Settings, , London, MacMillan; Barnes, R., Conversation analysis of communication in medical care: Description and beyond (2019) Research on Language and Social Interaction, 52 (3), pp. 300-315; Beeke, S., Johnson, F., Beckley, F., Enabling better conversations between a man with aphasia and his conversation partner: Incorporating writing into turn taking (2014) Research on Language and Social Interaction, 47 (3), pp. 292-305; Bickman, L., Rog, D., Applied research design: A practical approach (2009) The Sage Handbook of Applied Research Method, pp. 3-43. , Bickman L., Rog D., (eds), London, Sage, (eds; Drew, P., Conversation analysis (2004) Handbook of Language and Social Interaction, pp. 71-102. , Fitch K., Sanders R., (eds), Mahwah, NJ, Lawrence Erlbaum, In:, (eds; Drew, P., Heritage, J., Analyzing talk at work: An introduction (1992) Talk at Work, pp. 3-65. , Drew P., Heritage J., (eds), Cambridge, Cambridge University Press, In:, (eds; Lester, J., O’Reilly, M., (2019) Applied Conversation Analysis: Social Interaction in Institutional Settings, , Thousand Oaks, CA, Sage; Hepburn, A., Wilkinson, S., Butler, C., Intervening with conversation analysis in telephone helpline services: Strategies to improve effectiveness (2014) Research on Language and Social Interaction, 47 (3), pp. 239-254; Heritage, J., Conversation analysis at century’s end: practices of talk-in-interaction, their distributions, and their outcomes (1999) Research on Language & Social Interaction, 32 (1-2), pp. 69-76; Heritage, J., Conversation analysis and institutional talk (2005) Handbook of Language and Social Interaction, pp. 103-149. , Fitch K., Sanders R., (eds), Mahwah, NJ, Lawrence Earlbaum, In:, (eds; Jefferson, G., Glossary of transcript symbols with an introduction (2004) Conversation Analysis: Studies from the First Generation, pp. 13-31. , Lerner G.H., (ed), Amsterdam, John Benjamins, In:, (ed; Jenkins, L., Reuber, M., A conversation analytic intervention to help neurologists identify diagnostically relevant linguistic features in seizure patients’ talk (2014) Research on Language and Social Interaction, 47 (3), pp. 266-279; Kiyimba, N., O’Reilly, M., Reflecting on what ‘you said’ as a way of reintroducing difficult topics in child mental health assessments (2018) Child and Adolescent Mental Health, 23 (3), pp. 148-154; O’Reilly, M., Kiyimba, N., Karim, K., This is a question we have to ask everyone”: Asking young people about self-harm and suicide (2016) Journal of Psychiatric and Mental Health Nursing, 23 (8), pp. 479-488; O’Reilly, M., Lester, J., Muskett, T., How parents build a case for autism spectrum disorder during initial assessments: ‘We’re fighting a losing battle’ (2017) Discourse Studies, 19 (1), pp. 69-83; Pomerantz, A., Fehr, B.J., Conversation analysis: An approach to the study of social action as sense making practices (1997) Discourse as social interaction, 2, pp. 64-91; Sackett, D., Rosenberg, W., Gray, J., Evidence-based medicine: What it is and what it isn’t (1996) British Medical Journal, 312 (7023), pp. 71-72; Sacks, H., Notes on methodology (1984) Structures of Social Action, pp. 21-27. , Atkinson J., Heritage J., (eds), Cambridge, Cambridge University Press, In:, (eds; Sacks, H., (1992) Lectures on Conversation, Vols.

This article presents a sociosemiotic study of such practices as reflected in a corpus of headlines of eight newspapers of four countries in the early stages of the COVID-19 crisis. After an analysis of the institutional naming choices of the World Health Organization (WHO) and the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses, the study focuses on the changes in newspapers’ naming patterns following the WHO’s announcement of the disease name on 11 February 2020. A subsequent political controversy related to naming in the United States is then examined in reports of The New York Times and The Washington Post as a further illustration of how public discourses and perceptions can rapidly evolve in the context of health crises. © The Author(s) 2020.","Coronavirus; COVID-19; headline; institutional discourse; naming; news media; politics; sociosemiotics; World Health Organization",,,,,,,,,"Ainiala, T., Östman, J., Introduction: Socio-onomastics and pragmatics (2017) Socio-Onomastics: The Pragmatics of Names, pp. 1-18. , Ainiala T., Östman J., (eds), Amsterdam, John Benjamins, In:, (eds; Cheng, L., Cheng, W., Sin, K.K., Revisiting legal terms: A semiotic perspective (2014) Semiotica, 202, pp. 167-182; Conboy, M., (2012) Journalism Studies, , London, Routledge; Dahlen, H.G., Homer, C.S.E., Web-based news reports on midwives compared with obserticians: A prospective analysis (2012) Birth, 39 (1), pp. 48-56; Danesi, M., (2007) The Quest for Meaning: A Guide to Semiotic Theory and Practice, , Toronto, University of Toronto Press; Dor, D., On newspaper headlines as relevance optimizers (2003) Journal of Pragmatics, 35 (5), pp. 695-721; Enserink, M., Swine flu outbreak: Swine flu names evolving faster than swine flu itself (2009) Science, 324 (5929), p. 871; Enserink, M., Amid heightened concerns, new name for novel coronavirus emerges (2013) Science, 340 (6133), p. 673; Frege, G., On sense and reference (1960) Translations from the Philosophical Writings of Gottlob Frege, pp. 56-68. , Geach P., Black M., Black, (eds), Oxford, Basil Blackwell, In:, (eds), (trans; Fukuda, K., Wang, R., Vallat, B., Naming diseases: First do no harm (2015) Science, 348 (6235), p. 643; Gorbalenya, A.E., Baker, S.C., Baric, R.S., The species Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus: Classifying 2019-nCoV and naming it SARS-CoV-2.

The backbone of participatory democracy is that some authority is granted to the citizenry and by drawing on video data (38 hours) from a year-long participatory project, this conversation analytic study shows that the adolescents are instructed to a deontic role rooted in epistemics, benefactive considerations, as well as temporal aspects relating to future citizenship and hope. The institutional representatives perform actions that determine how the adolescents should, in their turn, perform actions of influence.

Its aim is to investigate whether the Protestant work ethic still pervades the American thinking about work. Through a qualitative analysis of the corpus of 100 randomly selected commencement addresses delivered during 2016 and 2017 graduation ceremonies in American universities, it is shown how work-related topics are employed by the speakers celebrating the graduates’ academic achievements and providing them with advice for the future. The Discourse-Historical Approach, committed to Critical Discourse Analysis, has been chosen as a methodological approach, integrating the interpretation of discourses and texts with sociological and historical research, studies on narration, stylistics, rhetoric and argumentation theory.

The analytic interest lies in how confessions are locally and interactionally managed, that is, how ‘doing confessing’ is achieved in the television interview context. We show how the host’s opening turn constrains the celebrity guest’s contribution and secures overt admission of guilt, while simultaneously inviting the celebrity guest to tell their side of the story. We also show how celebrity guests produce descriptions which minimize the extent and severity of their transgressions, reduce agency and transform the character of their transgression. In doing so, we argue that celebrity interviewees can convey mitigations and extenuations which diminish the extent of their responsibility – calling into question the very nature of their confession. We propose that our findings demonstrate the hybrid nature of interviewing in the celebrity TV confessional and contribute to our understanding of how ‘doing confessing’ in the public eye is discursively and interactionally negotiated. © The Author(s) 2019.","Accusation; admitting guilt; broadcast talk; celebrity TV interview; confession; conversation analysis; discourse analysis; facework; image repair/restoration",,,,,,,,,"Adelswärd, V., Aronsson, K., Jönsson, L., The unequal distribution of interactional space: Dominance and control in courtroom interaction (1987) Text, 7 (4), pp. 313-346; Atkinson, J.M., Drew, P., (1979) Order in Court: The Organization of Verbal Interaction in Judicial Settings, , London, Macmillan Press; Auburn, T., Drake, S., Willig, C., ‘You punched him, didn’t you?’: Versions of violence in accusatory interviews (1995) Discourse & Society, 6 (3), pp. 353-386; Bell, P., Van Leeuwen, T., (2006) The Media Interview: Confession, Contest, Conversation, , Sydney, NSW, Australia, University of New South Wales Press; Benoit, W.L., (1995) Accounts, Excuses, and Apologies: A Theory of Image Restoration Discourse, , Albany, NY, State University of New York Press; Benoit, W.L., Hugh Grant’s image restoration discourse: An actor apologizes (1997) Communication Quarterly, 45 (3), pp. 251-267; Benoit, W.L., (2015) Accounts, Excuses, and Apologies: Image Repair Theory and Research, , 2nd edn., Albany, NY, State University of New York Press; Clayman, S.E., Tribune of the people: Maintaining the legitimacy of aggressive journalism (1994) Media, Culture & Society, 24 (2), pp. 197-216; Clayman, S.E., Heritage, J., (2002) The News Interview: Journalists and Public Figures on the Air, , Cambridge, Cambridge University Press; Drew, P., Contested evidence in courtroom cross-examination: The case of a trial for rape (1992) Talk at Work: Interaction in Institutional Settings, pp. 470-520. , Drew P., Heritage J.C., (eds), New York, Cambridge University Press, In:, (eds; Edwards, D., Intentionality and mens rea in police interrogations: The production of actions as crimes (2008) Intercultural Pragmatics, 5 (2), pp. 177-199; Edwards, D., Fasulo, A., ‘To be honest’: Sequential uses of honesty phrases in talk-in-interaction (2006) Research on Language and Social Interaction, 39 (4), pp. 343-376; Galatolo, R., Drew, P., Narrative expansions as defensive practices in courtroom testimony (2006) Text & Talk, 26 (6), pp. 661-698; Goffman, E., On face work: An analysis of ritual elements in social interaction (1967) Interaction Ritual, pp. 5-45. , Goffman E., (ed), New York, Double Day, In:, (ed; Goffman, E., (1971) Relations in Public: Microstudies of the Public Order, , New York, Basic Books; Goodman, S., Walker, K., ‘Some I don’t remember and some I do’: Memory talk in accounts of intimate partner violence (2016) Discourse Studies, 18 (4), pp. 375-392; Goodwin, C., (1981) Conversational Organization: Interaction between Speakers and Hearers, , New York, Academic Press; Goodwin, C., Between and within: Alternative sequential treatments of continuers and assessments (1986) Human Studies, 9 (2-3), pp. 205-217; Hambrick, M.E., Frederick, E.L., Sanderson, J., From yellow to blue: Exploring Lance Armstrong’s image repair strategies across traditional and social media (2013) Communication & Sport, 3 (2), pp. 196-218; Hepburn, A., Bolden, G., (2017) Transcribing for Social Research, , London, SAGE; Heritage, J., Designing questions and setting agendas in the news interview (2002) Studies in Language and Social Interaction, pp. 57-90. , Glenn P., LeBaron C., Mandelbaum J., (eds), Mahwah, NJ, Lawrence Erlbaum, In:, (eds; Heritage, J., Questioning in medicine (2010) Why Do You Ask?

Certain discourse genres, however, like application letters, job interviews or the LinkedIn summaries which are the research object of this article serve, by definition, to promote the professional as skilful. Hence, the question arises to what extent these discourse genres take into account the (potentially) risky nature of self-praise. On the basis of a corpus of some 90 French and US LinkedIn summaries, this article shows, on one hand, that besides asserting explicitly which competent identity and skills one has, LinkedIn-members use a whole array of more or less subtle indirect strategies to express skilfulness, including strategies pertaining to the area of reported speech. On the other hand, the analysis reveals that downgrading devices are hardly attested, contrary to upgrading modifiers, which also exhibit a remarkable variation. © The Author(s) 2019.","Downgraders; indirect/direct speech acts; LinkedIn; politeness theory; pragmatic modifiers; self-praise; self-promotion; skilfulness; strengtheners",,,,,,,,,"Ariel, M., (2010) Defining Pragmatics, , Cambridge, Cambridge University Press; Austin, J.L., (1962) How to Do Things with Words, , Oxford, Oxford University Press; Barrick, M.R., Shaffer, J.A., DeGrassi, S.W., What you see may not be what you get: Relationships among self-presentation tactics and ratings of interview and job performance (2009) Journal of Applied Psychology, 94 (6), pp. 1394-1411; Dayter, D., Self-praise in microblogging (2014) Journal of Pragmatics, 62, pp. 91-102; Dayter, D., (2016) Discursive Self in Microblogging: Speech Acts, Stories and Self-praise, , Amsterdam, John Benjamins Publishing Company; Fragale, A.R., Grant, A.M., Busy brains, boasters’ gains: Self-promotion effectiveness depends on audiences cognitive resources (2015) Journal of Experimental Social Psychology, 58, pp. 63-76; Fraser, B., ‘Pragmatic competence: The case of hedging (2010) New Approaches to Hedging, pp. 15-34. , Kaltenböck G., Mihatsch W., Schneider S., (eds), Bingley, Emerald Group Publishing Limited, In:, (eds; Goffman, E., On face-work: An analysis of ritual elements of social interaction (1981) Psychiatry: Journal for the Study of Interpersonal Processes, 18 (3), pp. 213-231; Heritage, J., Raymond, G., The terms of agreement: Indexing epistemic authority and subordination in talk-in-interaction (2005) Social Psychology Quarterly, 68 (1), pp. 15-38; Higgins, C., Judge, T., The effect of applicant influence tactics on recruiter perceptions of fit and hiring recommendations: A field study (2004) Journal of Applied Psychology, 89 (4), pp. 622-632; Hofstede, G., Hofstede, G.J., Minkov, M., (2010) Cultures and organizations: Software of the Mind, , New York, McGraw-Hill; House, J., Kasper, G., Politeness markers in English and German (1981) Conversational Routine: Explorations in Standardized Communication Situations and Prepatterned Speech, pp. 157-185. , Coulmas F., (ed), The Hague; Paris; New York, Mouton Publishers, (,):, In:, (ed; Johnson, G., Griffith, J., Buckley, R., A new model of impression management: Emotions in the ‘black box’ of organizational persuasion (2016) Journal of Occupational and Organizational Psychology, 89, pp. 111-140; Kacmar, M., Delery, J., Ferris, G., Differential effectiveness of applicant impression management tactics on employment interview decisions (1992) Journal of Applied Social Psychology, 22, pp. 1250-1272; Leech, G., (1983) Principles of Pragmatics, , London, Longman; Leech, G., (2014) The Pragmatics of Politeness, , Oxford, Oxford University Press; Locher, M.A., Polite behavior within relational work: The discursive approach to politeness’ (2006) Multilingua, 25-3, pp. 249-267; Locher, M.A., Watts, R., Politeness theory and relational work (2005) Journal of Politeness Research, 1, pp. 9-33; Locher, M.A., Watts, R., Relational work and impoliteness: Negotiating norms of linguistic behaviour (2008) Impoliteness in Language: Studies on its Interplay with Power in Theory and Practice, pp. 77-99. , Bousfield D., Locher M.A., (eds), Berlin, De Gruyter Mouton, In:, (eds; Martin, J., White, P.R.R., (2005) The Language of Evaluation, , New York, Palgrave Macmillan; Matley, D., ‘This is NOT a# humblebrag, this is just a# brag’: The pragmatics of self-praise, hashtags and politeness in Instagram posts (2018) Discourse, Context & media, 22, pp. 30-38; Meinl, M., (2010) Electronic complaints: An empirical study on British English and German complaints on eBay, , PhD Dissertation, University of Bonn, Bonn; Miller, L.C., Cooke, L.L., Tsang, J., Should i brag?

While previous studies of short messaging service (SMS) communication show that users usually send clusters of FPPs and that SPPs are ordered in the same chronology, little is known about sequential practices of dealing with multiple FPPs in text-based WhatsApp communication. This article shows that in German WhatsApp dialogues, users apply a chronological as well as a reversed ordering of SPPs. It is argued that this result can only be partly attributed to the affordances of the mobile messenger.

The primary purpose is to reveal its preferential ways of representing Hong Kong and explicate the intricate relations between language use and the historical and socio-political contexts. Through an integration of the methods and theories associated with critical discourse analysis and corpus linguistics, this study conducts both synchronic and diachronic analyses of the representations of Hong Kong from 1997 to 2017. The findings suggest that The Times’ representations of Hong Kong tend to be crisis- and conflict-oriented. While evoking constant fear about the future of Hong Kong, it still suggests that it is Britain’s duty and moral obligation to protect the former British colony. The same trend can also be identified in The Times’ representations of the mass protests against the proposed extradition bill in 2019. © The Author(s) 2019.","Britain; corpus-assisted discourse study; critical discourse analysis; Hong Kong; news; the extradition bill; The Times",,,,,,"17CYY065","The authors thank the anonymous reviewer and Prof. Tuen van Dijk for their critical comments on an earlier version of this article.

This practice marks a shift in the journalistic norms, positioning journalism and news users within the neoliberal paradigm. In this view, the study proposes a discursive approach to examine how gamified news discourse is colonized by the neoliberal values of marketization and commodification. The analysis takes a case study of Pirate Fishing: An Interactive Investigation, a gamified news launched by Al Jazeera. It is not just the narrative of Pirate that carries ideological bearings, rather the ludic design itself is found to be fit within the neoliberal mentality. Therefore, the ludic semiosis of Pirate Fishing is examined as well. As such, a dialectical relation between discourse, semiotics and neoliberal ideologies, in the context of gamification, is drawn in this article.

By analyzing the university presidents’ messages published in the websites of 36 top-ranked universities in China, the aim is to ascertain the extent to which this institutionalized genre imbricates a marketizing role with other ideological imperatives. Informed by the theoretical principles of Critical Discourse Analysis and adopting a genre analysis methodological approach, we first examined the macro-level rhetorical structure followed by a micro-level analysis of the discursive strategies used in the presidents’ messages. The findings reveal a dynamic interweaving of three distinct discursive strands – bureaucratic, conversational and advertising – constructed in and around the move structure of the presidents’ messages. This interdiscursive analysis reveals competing imperatives and contestations that reflect the dual role of the presidents’ messages to project a globalized, international outlook while maintaining an allegiance to political ideologies and national interests that top-ranked universities in China have to simultaneously negotiate. © The Author(s) 2019.","China; critical discourse analysis; genre analysis; interdiscursive analysis; marketization of universities; president’s message",,,,,,,,,"Albers-Miller, N.D., Gelb, B.D., Business advertising appeals as a mirror of cultural dimensions: A study of eleven countries (1996) Journal of Advertising, 25 (4), pp. 57-70; Altbach, P.G., Knight, J., The internationalization of higher education: Motivations and realities (2007) Journal of Studies in International Education, 11 (3-4), pp. 290-305; Askehave, I., The impact of marketization on higher education genres – The international student prospectus as a case in point (2007) Discourse Studies, 9 (6), pp. 723-742; Bhatia, V.K., Towards critical genre analysis (2008) Advances in Discourse Studies, pp. 166-177. , Bhatia V.K., Flowerdew J., Jones R.H., (eds), New York, Routledge, In:, (eds; Bhatia, V.K., Interdiscursivity in professional communication (2010) Discourse & Communication, 21 (1), pp. 32-50; Bhatia, V.K., (2013) Analysing Genre: Language Use in Professional Settings, , Oxon, Routledge; Biber, D., Connor, U., Upton, T.A., (2007) Discourse on the Move: Using Corpus Analysis to Describe Discourse Structure, , Amsterdam; Philadelphia, PA, John Benjamins Publishing; Burbules, N.C., Torres, C.A., (2000) Globalization and Education: Critical Perspectives, , New York and London, Routledge; Chan, D., Mok, K.-H., Educational reforms and coping strategies under the tidal wave of marketisation: A comparative study of Hong Kong and the mainland (2001) Comparative Education, 37 (1), pp. 21-41; Cheng, Y., Wang, Q., Building world-class universities in Mainland China (2012) Journal of International Higher Education, 5 (2), pp. 67-69; (2017) (shuāngyīliú dàxué): Double top university plan, , http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/opinion/2017-09/25/content_32446664.htm, accessed 31 March 2019, Available online at 双一流大学; Chouliaraki, L., Fairclough, N., (1999) Discourse in Late Modernity: Rethinking Critical Discourse Analysis, , Edinburgh, Edinburgh University Press; Connell, I., Galasiński, D., Academic mission statements: An exercise in negotiation (1998) Discourse & Society, 9 (4), pp. 457-479; DeWitt, A.O., Dahlin, L.A., Socially responsible marketing (2009) Northeast Business & Economics Proceedings, 36, pp. 69-72; Eisenberg, E.M., Ambiguity as strategy in organizational communication (1984) Communication Monographs, 51 (3), pp. 227-242; Fairclough, N., (1992) Discourse and Social Change, , Cambridge, Polity Press; Fairclough, N., Critical discourse analysis and the marketization of public discourse: The universities (1993) Discourse & Society, 4 (2), pp. 133-168; Fairclough, N., (1995) Critical Discourse Analysis: The Critical Study of Language, , London and New York, Longman; Fairclough, N., (2001) Language and Power, , Harlow, Longman; Fairclough, N., (2003) Analysing Discourse: Textual Analysis for Social Research, , London and New York, Routledge; Furedi, F., Introduction to the marketisation of higher education and the student as consumer (2010) The Marketisation of Higher Education and the Student as Consumer, pp. 1-8. , Molesworth M., Scullion R., Nixon E., (eds), London and New York, Routledge, In:, (eds; Halliday, M.A.K., (1978) Language as Social Semiotic: The Social Interpretation of Language and Meaning, , London, Edward Arnold; Halliday, M.A.K., (1994) An Introduction to Functional Grammar, , London, Edward Arnold; Han, Z., The marketization of public discourse: The Chinese universities (2014) Discourse & Communication, 8 (1), pp. 85-103; Hartmann, D.P., Considerations in the choice of interobserver reliability estimates (1977) Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis, 10 (1), pp. 103-116; Kotler, P., Armstrong, G., (2011) Principles of Marketing, , Uer Saddle River, NJ, Pearson Prentice Hall; Kwong, J., Introduction: Marketization and privatization in education (2000) International Journal of Educational Development, 20, pp. 87-92; Laczniak, G.R., Murphy, P.E., Normative perspectives for ethical and socially responsible marketing (2006) Journal of Macromarketing, 26 (2), pp. 154-177; Liu, J., Fang, X., What are the dispute of the existence and abolition of ‘211’ and ‘985’ (2016) Contemporary Educational Management, 6, pp. 20-25; McCaig, C., Access agreements, widening participation and market positionality: Enabling student choice?

The study combines corpus semantic tagging analysis for readers’ choices of evaluative lexis with a manual analysis of Appraisal resources for reading position construction based on a whole text perspective. The results show that readers are likely to use Appraisal resources strategically to defend their own opinions against other commenters or affiliate with large numbers of potential readers without commenting. Furthermore, comments were found to be directed either at the text or at other commenters, and through this a number of different reading positions were revealed.

Using video-recordings of orientation lectures as data, the study focuses on question–answer sequences in which the lecturer’s question probes into the state of the employees’ knowledge; in particular, it looks at the third turn of the sequence, in which the lecturer comes to a conclusion concerning the participants’ knowledge. This is shown to be an unavoidably practical accomplishment, which is contingent on both the often ambivalent responses of the participants and the design of the knowledge-probing question. Also, the lecturer orients to being responsible for providing the employees with the necessary knowledge that they do not have. The study contributes to discussion of the interactional organization of knowledge in institutional settings, and it sheds light on the pros and cons of lectures as interactional encounters. © The Author(s) 2019.","Conversation analysis; knowledge-probing question; lecture; multimodality; new employee orientation; question–answer sequence",,,,,,"TyÃ¶suojelurahasto","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was supported by the Finnish Work Environment Fund.",,"Antaki, C., Six kinds of applied conversation analysis (2011) Applied Conversation Analysis: Intervention and Change in Institutional Talk, pp. 1-14. , Antaki C., (ed), London, Palgrave Macmillan, In:, (ed; Artemeva, N., Fox, J., Awareness versus production: Probing students’ antecedent genre knowledge (2010) Journal of Business and Technical Communication, 24 (4), pp. 476-515; Day, D., Kjærbeck, S., Treating student contributions as displays of understanding in group supervision (2012) Evaluating Cognitive Competences in Interaction, pp. 67-88. , Rasmussen G., Brouwer C.E., Day D., (eds), Amsterdam, John Benjamins Publishing, In:, (eds; Goodwin, C., Professional vision (1994) American Anthropologist, 96 (3), pp. 606-633; Goodwin, C., Action and embodiment within situated human interaction (2000) Journal of Pragmatics, 32, pp. 1489-1522; Griffin, A., Colella, A., Goparaju, S., Newcomer and organizational socialization tactics: An interactionist perspective (2000) Human Resource Management Review, 10 (4), pp. 453-474; Hakulinen, A., Vilkuna, M., Korhonen, R., (2004) Iso suomen kielioppi (The large grammar of Finnish), , Helsinki, The Finnish Literature Society, [,]; Heritage, J., Epistemics in action: Action formation and territories of knowledge (2012) Research on Language and Social Interaction, 45 (1), pp. 1-29. , (, a; Heritage, J., The epistemic engine: Sequence organization and territories of knowledge (2012) Research on Language and Social Interaction, 45 (1), pp. 30-52. , (, b; Hindmarsh, J., Reynolds, P., Dunne, S., Exhibiting understanding: The body in apprenticeship (2011) Journal of Pragmatics, 43, pp. 489-503; Kim, Y., ‘What is story-steruh type?’ Knowledge asymmetry, intersubjectivity, and learning opportunities in conversation-for-learning (2017) Applied Linguistics, 40, pp. 307-328; Klein, H., Weawer, N., The effectiveness of an organizational-level orientation training program in the socialization of new hires (2000) Personnel Psychology, 53, pp. 47-66; Koskela, I., Arminen, I., The embedded evaluations in air traffic control training (2012) Evaluating Cognitive Competences in Interaction, pp. 15-42. , Rasmussen G., Brouwer C.E., Day D., (eds), Amsterdam, John Benjamins Publishing, In:, (eds; Lindwall, O., Lymer, G., Uses of ‘understand’ in science education (2011) Journal or Pragmatics, 43, pp. 452-474; Margutti, P., ‘Are you human beings?’ Order and knowledge construction through questioning in primary classroom interaction (2006) Linguistics and Education, 17, pp. 313-346; Mehan, H., (1979) Learning Lessons: Social Organization in the Classroom, , Cambridge, MA, Harvard University Press; Melander, H., Sahlström, F., Learning to fly – The progressive development of situation awareness (2009) Scandinavian Journal of Education Research, 53 (2), pp. 151-166; Mondada, L., Working with video: How surgeons produce video records of their actions (2003) Visual Studies, 18 (1), pp. 58-73; Nissi, R., Lehtinen, E., Negotiation of expertise and multifunctionality: PowerPoint presentations as interactional activity types in workplace meetings (2016) Language & Communication, 48, pp. 1-17; Raymond, G., Grammar and social relations.

First, corpus-based discourse analysis was employed to explore the construction of the Malaysian Airlines tragedy MH17 in four selected Malaysian and British newspapers. In addition, an attitudinal study examining 50 Malaysian and 50 UK nationals’ perceptions of the tragedy was conducted. Keywords analysis revealed an overall tendency for the news media to construct the air tragedy through classifications between ‘us’ and ‘others’. Specifically, important ‘Us’ (Malaysian elites) and non-important ‘Other’ (non-Malaysian) in the Malaysian newspapers, versus good ‘Us’ (the West) and evil ‘Others’ (Russia) in the British newspapers. The attitudinal analysis shows, for both the Malaysian and the UK respondents, the most salient associations with the MH17 tragedy related to ‘conflicts’. © The Author(s) 2019.","Corpus; discourse analysis; keyword analysis; language attitudes; MH17",,,,,,,,,"Ashlin, A., Ladle, R.J., ‘Natural disasters’ and newspapers: Post-tsunami environmental discourse (2007) Environmental Hazards, 7 (4), pp. 330-341; Baker, P., (2010) Sociolinguistics and Corpus Linguistics, , Edinburgh, Edinburgh University Press; Berry, T.R., Wharf-Higgins, J., Naylor, P.J., SARS Wars: An examination of the quantity and construction of health information in the news media (2007) Health Communication, 21 (1), pp. 35-44; Boltanski, L., (1999) Distant Suffering: Morality, Media and Politics, , Cambridge, Cambridge University Press; Bonanno, G.A., Brewin, C.R., Kaniasty, K., Weighing the costs of disaster: Consequences, risks, and resilience in individuals, families, and communities (2010) Psychological Science in the Public Interest, 11 (1), pp. 1-49; Bondi, M., Scott, M., (2010) Keyness in Texts, , Amsterdam, John Benjamins Publishing; Boyle, D., Was MH17 flying through warzone to save fuel?

The affair, a significant event in Israel’s collective memory, was narrativized as a ‘media scandal’ with multiple discourses of guilt, blame and victimhood. Analysis of the linguistic and visual coverage of Jewish Israeli mothers in six newspapers shows how mothers were reconstructed as guilty for the loss of the babies’ lives and well-being. In addition, the mothers were called to ‘come back’ to breastfeeding, an act that could have saved their children. Overall, this coverage reaffirmed the traditional social norms of the ‘ideal Jewish mother’ who sacrifices herself for her baby and is objectified as ‘food’, norms that were not commonly practiced by most Jewish Israeli families at the time. © The Author(s) 2019.","Blame; critical discourse analysis; feeding; guilt; health; motherhood; newspaper",,,,,,,,,"Alroi de Behr, H., Returning to the sources?

Using Van Leeuwen’s legitimation framework, three different data sets are analysed: 47 ‘platform of values’ texts, a focus group discussion with seven senior HR officers, and a quantitative questionnaire study answered by civil servants at three public authorities. The analysis shows how the existence of ‘platform of values’ texts and practices is legitimized through rationalizations, above all by describing the texts as concrete means for reaching specific ends and, with regard to the choice of core values, through a custom-conformity type of authority. Thus, this article addresses discursive transformations of contemporary organizations with a particular focus on available discursive space for critical thinking in the wake of New Public Management and related developments. © The Author(s) 2019.","Conformity; core values; discursive identity; legitimation; New Public Management; professional practice; public authorities; rationalization; ‘platform of values’",,,,,,"Riksbankens Jubileumsfond, RJ","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work is part of the research project The archaeology of a new genre: Vision and values texts of public authorities in Sweden supported by the Riksbankens Jubileumsfond (The Swedish foundation for humanities and social sciences) (Grant No. P15-0119).",,"Alvesson, M., (2013) The Triumph of Emptiness: Consumption, Higher Education, and Work Organization, , Oxford, Oxford University Press; Alvesson, M., Värdegrunder ett surrogat för verkliga förbättringar [Platforms of values a surrogate for real improvements] (2015) Dagens Nyheter, , https://www.dn.se/debatt/vardegrunder-ett-surrogat-for-verkliga-forbattringar/, 3, April; Alvesson, M., Spicer, A., (2016) The Stupidity Paradox: The Power and Pitfalls of Functional Stupidity at Work, , London, Profile Books; Alvesson, M., Willmott, H., Identity regulation as organizational control: Producing the appropriate individual (2002) Journal of Management Studies, 39 (5), pp. 619-644; Bao, G., Wang, X., Larsen, G.L., Beyond new public governance: A value-based global framework for performance management, governance, and leadership (2013) Administration & Society, 45 (4), pp. 443-467; Bhatia, V.K., (2017) Critical Genre Analysis: Investigating Interdiscursive Performance in Professional Practice, , Abingdon, Routledge; Björkvall, A., Critical genre analysis of management texts in the public sector: Towards a theoretical and methodological framework (2018) Kritiska text- och diskursstudier, pp. 57-79. , Wojahn D., Seiler Brylla C., Westberg G., (eds), Huddinge, Södertörns högskola, In:, (eds), [Critical text and discourse studies]; Bourdieu, P., (1977) Outline of a Theory of Practice, , Cambridge, Cambridge University Press; Brereton, M., Temple, M., The new public service ethos: An ethical environment for governance (1999) Public Administration, 77 (3), pp. 455-474; Chaidas, D., The benefits of narratology in the analysis of multimodal legitimation: The case of new democracy (2018) Discourse & Communication, 12 (3), pp. 258-277; Chouliaraki, L., Introduction: The soft power of war.

Using analytical categories developed within the discourse-historical approach, the analysis indicates three general, strongly secularist, representations of tunisianité. One of these, which can be called essentialist, claims an unmistakable ethnolinguistic connection to a glorified pre-Arabo-Islamic classicism which goes back to the foundation of Carthage (814–146 BC). A second and a more dominant (avowedly consensual) one construes tunisianité in assimilationist terms, that is, Tunisia as a ‘melting pot’ lumping different Eastern and Western ethnolinguistic and cultural traditions. A third emerging, but a marginalized trend in the data, grounds tunisianité within the Enlightenment/Revolutionary ideals of Democracy, Dignity and Freedom and warns against its possible disintegration because of its vulnerability to the upheavals of terrorism, corporatism, populism and socioeconomic insecurity. While the third representation is laudable from the perspective of the Revolutionary demands, the dominant nationalist identity discourse remains backward-looking, reactionary and strongly preoccupied with a perceived political invasion by the Islamist-Arabist Other. It is argued that the dominant model of identity politics and the political economy associated with it are incompatible with Tunisians’ aspirations for socioeconomic development and social justice. © The Author(s) 2019.","Arabism; critical discourse analysis; identity politics; Islamism; media discourse; power; the Arab Spring; Tunisia/Maghreb",,,,,,,,,"Anderson, B., (1983) Imagined Communities: Reflections on the Origins and Spread of Nationalism, , London, Verso; Billig, M., (1995) Banal Nationalism, , London, SAGE; Blommaert, J., Debate is closed (1999) Language Ideological Debates, pp. 425-438. , Blommaert J., (ed), Berlin; New York, Mouton de Gruyter, In:, (ed; Blommaert, J., (2005) Discourse: A Critical Introduction, , Cambridge, Cambridge University Press; Costelloe, L., Discourses of sameness: Expressions of nationalism in newspaper discourse on French urban violence in 2005 (2014) Discourse & Society, 25 (3), pp. 315-340; Foucault, M., (2002) The Archaeology of Knowledge, , London, Routledge Classics, 1972, (, [,]; Georgalou, M., ‘Scoring a hat trick’: Nation, football, and critical discourse analysis (2009) Rice Working Papers in Linguistics, 1, pp. 108-141; Habermas, J., Why Europe needs a constitution (2001) New Left Review, 11, pp. 5-26; Heller, M., Language and dis-citizenship in Canada (2013) Journal of Language, Identity and Education, 12 (3), p. 189; Howard, P., Parks, M., Social media and political change: Capacity, constraint, and consequence (2012) Journal of Communication, 62, pp. 359-362; Jerad, N., La politique linguistique dans la Tunisie postcoloniale [Language policy in post-colonial Tunisia] (2004) Trames de Langues: Usages et Métissage Linguistiques dans l’Histoire du Maghreb, pp. 523-544. , Jocelyne D., (ed), Paris, Masisonneuve et Larose, In:, (ed; Kalantzis, M., Antinomies of identity (2018) Honorary doctorate award speech, , Rhodes, Greece, 9, November, In; Laclau, E., Mouffe, C., (2014) Hegemony and Socialist Strategy: Towards a Radical Democratic Politics, , London, Verso; Lakhal, M., Tunisia and its debt (2018) Nawaat, , https://nawaat.org/portail/2018/11/14/tunisia-and-its-debt-our-invasive-friends-the-creditors/, 14, November; Mandaville, P., Reimagining Islam in diaspora: The politics of mediated community (2001) International Communication Gazette, 63 (2-3), pp. 169-186; Masri, S., (2017) Tunisia: An Arab Anomaly, , New York, Columbia University Press; (2017), http://tunisia.mom-rsf.org/en/service/Contact; Mouffe, C., For a politics of nomadic identity (1994) Travelers’ Tales: Narratives of Home and Displacement, pp. 102-111. , Robertson G., (ed), London, Routledge, In:, (eds; Reisigl, M., Wodak, R., (2001) Discourse and Discrimination, , London, Routledge; Ricento, T., The discursive construction of Americanism (2003) Discourse & Society, 14 (5), pp. 611-637; Rijkers, B., Freund, C., Nucifora, A., (2014) All in the Family: State Capture in Tunisia, , Washington, DC, The World Bank; Middle East and Northern Africa Region, Peterson Institute for International Economics; Smith, A.D., (1998) Nationalism and Modernism: A Critical Survey of Recent Theories of Nations and Nationalism, , London, Routledge; van Dijk, T.A., Race, riots and the press: An analysis of editorials in the British press about the 1985 disorders (1989) International Communication Gazette, 43, pp. 229-253; van Dijk, T.A., On the analysis of parliamentary debates on immigration (2000) The Semiotics of Racism: Approaches to Critical Discourse Analysis, pp. 85-103. , Reisigl M., Wodak R., (eds), Vienna, Passagen Verlag, In:, (eds; van Dijk, T.A., Ideology and discourse analysis (2006) Journal of Political Ideologies, 11, pp. 115-140; van Leeuwen, T., The representation of social actors (1996) Readings in Critical Discourse Analysis, pp. 32-70. , Coulthard C.R., Coulthard M., (eds), London, Routledge, In:, (eds; Vermeren, P., Maghreb: des élites entre deux mondes [Maghreb: An Elite Between Two Worlds] (2005) Revue Internationale d’education de Sèvres, 39, pp. 47-55; Wodak, R., Language, power and identity (2012) Language Teaching, 45, pp. 215-233; Wodak, R., Discourses about nationalism (2018) The Routledge Handbook of Critical Discourse Studies, pp. 403-420. , Flowerdew J., Richardson J., (eds), London, Routledge, In:, (eds; Wodak, R., Boukala, S., (Supra)national identity and language: Rethinking national and European migration policies and the linguistic integration of migrants (2015) Annual Review of Applied Linguistics, 35, pp. 253-273; Wodak, R., De Cillia, R., Resigl, M., Liebhart, K., (2009) The Discursive Construction of National Identity, , Edinburgh, Edinburgh University Press; Zubaida, S., Islam and nationalism: Continuities and contradictions (2004) Nations and Nationalism, 10, pp. 407-420","Helal, F.; University of JendoubaTunisia; email: fethi_helal@yahoo.fr",,,"SAGE Publications Ltd",,,,,17504813,,,,"English","Discourse Commun.",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85064845771

We seek to identify how space is constructed as a (de)legitimation strategy in relation to the actors involved and the actions taking place across four different news broadcast pieces in the light of Multimodal Critical Discourse Analysis and Systemic Functional Linguistics. Results show that the multimodal representations of space are crucial to identify and functionalize hooded rioters as belonging to the student movement. Actions are dependent on the spaces in which actors operate, restricting the occupation of certain spaces to specific actors. Thus, transgressive protest actions are to be contained to educational spaces and represented as naturalized vandalism, ignoring the students’/demonstrators’ motivations to recuperate/vindicate the public space. © The Author(s) 2019.","Chile; framing; hooded rioters; legitimation; multimodal analysis; multimodal metaphor; narrative analysis; news broadcasts; space; student movement",,,,,,"Fondo Nacional de Desarrollo CientÃ­fico y TecnolÃ³gico, FONDECYT: 1161126

Through analyzing 584 online reviews (256 in Chinese and 328 in English), we found similar moves in both sets of data, including reviews about the accommodation and about the host, expressing feelings, and making a recommendation. However, we found significant differences in expressing these moves in communication styles. We found that there was a stronger sense of a close and family- like relationship between the guest and the host in the Chinese reviews, while English reviews stressed the importance of space and privacy. © The Author(s) 2019.","Airbnb; Confucian cultural values; cross-cultural rhetoric; genre analysis; peer-to-peer online reviews; sharing economy context",,,,,,"17JZD020","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/ or publication of this article: This work is supported by the China Humanities and Social Science Research Foundation of the Ministry of Education, major Grant Project No. 17JZD020.",,"(2018) Fast facts, , https://press.atairbnb.com/fast-facts/, accessed 24 June 2018; Aristotle, O., (1991) On Rhetoric: A Theory of Civic Discourse, , New York, Oxford University Press, (edited and translated by; Basturkmen, H., Commenting on results in published research articles and masters dissertations in language teaching (2009) Journal of English for Academic Purposes, 8 (4), pp. 241-251; Belk, R., You are what you can access: Sharing and collaborative consumption online (2014) Journal of Business Research, 67 (8), pp. 1595-1600; Berkenkotter, C., Huckin, T.N., Rethinking genre from a sociocognitive perspective (1995) Genre Knowledge in Disciplinary Communication: Cognition/Culture/Power, pp. 1-25. , Berkenkotter C., Huckin T.N., (eds), Hillsdale, NJ, Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, In:, (eds; Bhatia, V., (2004) Worlds of Written Discourse: A Genre-based View, , London; New York, Continuum; Bhatia, V.K., (1993) Analysing Genre: Language Use in Professional Settings, , New York, Longman Group; Bhatia, V.K., Genre analysis, ESP and professional practice (2008) English for Specific Purposes, 27 (2), pp. 161-174; Braun, V., Clarke, V., Using thematic analysis in psychology (2006) Qualitative Research in Psychology, 3 (2), pp. 77-101; Bridges, J., Vásquez, C., If nearly all Airbnb reviews are positive, does that make them meaningless?

The movement is sometimes framed as a religion, with rituals, psalms, creeds and the invocation of a deity (Ana) who personifies the ED. The latter aspect is likely to influence identities and behaviours as well as providing emotional support and motivation for community members. However, there is little sustained empirical analysis of how members themselves orient to and self-position within the religious discourse. Here, we apply the concept of interdiscursivity to examine the construction of Ana as god(dess). Drawing on a body of online interactions from one pro-ana website over a 47-day period, we discursively analyse members’ constructions of Ana and their relationship with her. With reference to biblical texts, we consider how these constructions directly reference concepts of Christian religion and faith. Implications for understanding pro-ana and interdiscursivity are discussed. © The Author(s) 2019.","Ana; discourse analysis; eating disorder; identity; interdiscursivity; online community; pro-ana; religious metaphor",,,,,,,,,"Anderluh, M., Tchanturia, K., Rabe-Hesketh, S., Childhood obsessive-compulsive personality traits in adult women with eating disorders: Defining a broader eating disorder phenotype (2003) American Journal of Psychiatry, 160 (2), pp. 242-247; (2012) Ethical Decision-making and Internet Research, , Chicago, IL, Association of Internet Researchers; Bardone-Cone, A., Cass, K., What does viewing a pro-anorexia website do?

Internet memes are multimodal artifacts featuring ideological singularities designed for ‘flash’ consumption, often composed by numerous voices echoing popular, online culture. This study proposes that ‘Fake News’ Internet memes are weaponized iconoclastic multimodal propaganda (WIMP) discourse and attempts to delineate them as such by asking: What power relations and ideologies do Internet memes featuring the expression ‘fake news’ harbor? How might those manifestations qualify as WIMP discourse? A multimodal critical discourse analysis of a small pool of ‘fake news’ Internet memes drawn from four popular social media websites revealed what agencies were often targeted and from what political canons they likely emerged. Findings indicate that many Internet memes featuring ‘fake news’ are specifically directed, revealing an underlying hazard that WIMP discourse could diminish democratic processes while influencing online trajectories of public discourse. © The Author(s) 2019.","Fake News; Internet memes; multimodal critical discourse analysis; propaganda; weaponized discourse",,,,,,,,,"Anderson, E., Inclusive masculinity in a fraternal setting (2008) Men and Masculinities, 105 (5), pp. 604-620; Bateman, J., (2014) Text and Image: A Critical Introduction to the Visual/Verbal Divide, , Abingdon; New York, Routledge; Bawarshi, A.S., Reiff, M.J., (2010) Genre: An Introduction to History, Theory, Research, and Pedagogy, , Washington, DC, Parlor Press; Berger, P., Luckmann, T., (1966) The Social Construction of Knowledge: A Treatise in the Sociology of Knowledge, , New York, Doubleday; Bernays, E.L., (1927) The Verdict of Public Opinion on Propaganda, , New York, Universal Trade Press Syndicate; Bernays, E.L., The marketing of national policies: A study of war propaganda (1942) The Journal of Marketing, 63 (3), pp. 236-244; Börzsei, L.K., Makes a meme instead: A concise history of internet memes (2013) New Media Studies Magazine, 7 (7), pp. 152-189; Bouvier, G., What is a discourse approach to Twitter, Facebook, YouTube and other social media: Connecting with other academic fields?

Survey evidence has shown that Brazilians’ degree of concern about climate change is higher than almost anywhere else, with nine out of 10 Brazilians considering climate change a serious problem. The primary purpose of this study is to investigate how the press engendered Brazilians’ striking level of climate change concern, with special attention to how the discourse developed over time. To this end, I undertake a corpus-assisted discourse analysis to examine the most dominant linguistic patterns in the discourse, presenting evidence on an unprecedented scale and with considerable depth. The corpus consists of 19,686 newspaper texts (11.4 million words) published by 12 Brazilian broadsheet papers. The results are interpreted in the light of available opinion polls on the public’s perception of climate change as well as Brazil’s national context and environmental governance. © The Author(s) 2019.","Brazil; climate change; corpus discourse analysis; global warming; media discourse; media representations",,,,,,"Economic and Social Research Council, ESRC: ES/K002155/1","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/ or publication of this article: This research was funded by the Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) as part of the Changing Climates project (http://cass.lancs.ac.uk/?page_id=79) conducted at the ESRC Centre for Corpus Approaches to Social Science (ES/K002155/1).",,"Anthony, L., (2016) SarAnt (Version 1.1.0).

Set in an international business context, all communication took place in English and for the most part via email. Complex discursive processes facilitated close interdisciplinary engagement and, more particularly, required that a single individual assume a key interactional role to oversee and advance the negotiation activities. This pivotal role entailed the strategic use of language and discourse to negotiate, account for, and justify the various stages of the negotiation. In addition to textual analyses of the negotiated contract and attendant emails, interviews were conducted with the principal lawyer and her senior partner in order to examine the textual findings grounded in the organisational context of a law firm and produce an ontology of this negotiation process. These research findings could be used to assist novice lawyers and business professionals to understand some of the discourse strategies and interactional roles that are often so critical for commercial contract negotiation activities. © The Author(s) 2019.","Contract negotiation; discourse analysis; discourse role performance; discursive expertise; English for Legal/Business Purposes; genre analysis; legal-business practice; mergers and acquisitions",,,,,,"5201300322","The ethical aspects of this study were approved by the law firm in Istanbul that participated in this research project and the Macquarie University Human Research Ethics Committee in accordance with the Australian Code for the Responsible Conduct of Research and the National Statement on Ethical Conduct in Human Research (2007) – (Ref No: 5201300322).",,"Bakhtin, M.M., (1981) The Dialogic Imagination, , Austin, TX, University of Texas Press; Berkenkotter, C., Huckin, T.C., (1995) Genre Knowledge in Disciplinary Communication, , Mahwah, NJ, Lawrence Erlbaum Associates; Bhatia, A., Bhatia, V.K., Discursive illusions in legislative discourse: A socio-pragmatic study (2011) International Journal for the Semiotics of Law, 24 (1), pp. 1-19; Bhatia, V.K., Genre-mixing in academic introductions (1997) English for Specific Purposes, 16 (3), pp. 181-196. , (, a; Bhatia, V.K., Power and politics of genre (1997) World Englishes, 16 (3), pp. 359-372. , (, b; Bhatia, V.K., Applied genre analysis: A multi-perspective model (2002) Iberica, 4, pp. 3-19; Bhatia, V.K., (2004) Worlds of Written Discourse: A Genre-Based View, , London, Continuum; Bhatia, V.K., Interdiscursivity in professional communication (2010) Discourse & Communication, 21 (1), pp. 32-50; Breeze, R., The discursive construction of professional relationships through the legal letter of advice (2014) Interpersonality in Legal Genres, pp. 280-302. , Breeze R., Gotti M., Sancho Guinda C., (eds), Bern, Peter Lang, In:, (eds; Bremner, S., Intertextuality and business communication textbooks: Why students need more textual support (2008) English for Specific Purposes, 27, pp. 306-321; Candlin, C.N., How can discourse be a measure of expertise?

The processes of problem-solving are, simultaneously, processes of self/other positioning. We take an Interactional Sociolinguistic perspective and draw on audio-recorded meeting talk collected in a multinational corporate workplace. Our analysis shows that interactants draw on issues of accountability, perceived/projected responsibilities and expertise in pursuit of their own interactional agenda in the problem-solving meeting.

Increased representation has not been equally distributed, however, as bisexuality remains an obscured sexual identity in discourses of sexuality. Through the use of diachronic corpus-based critical discourse analysis, this study seeks to uncover how bisexual people have been represented in the British press between 1957 and 2017. By specifically focusing on the discursive construction of bisexuality in The Times, the results reveal how bisexual people are represented as existing primarily in discourses of the past or in fiction. The Times corpus also reveals significant variation in the lexical meaning of bisexual throughout the 60 years in question. These findings contribute to contemporary theories of bisexual erasure which posit that bisexual people are denied the same ontological status as monosexual identities, that is, homosexuality and heterosexuality. © The Author(s) 2019.","Bisexual erasure; bisexuality; British Press; collocation analysis; concordance analysis; corpus analysis; corpus linguistics; corpus-assisted discourse studies; critical discourse analysis; diachronic corpus-based critical discourse analysis; diachronic variation; discourse analysis; discursive construction of identity; historical discourse analysis; LGBTQI studies; media representation; newspaper discourse; semantic variation; sexual identity; The Times",,,,,,,,,"Angelides, S., (2001) A History of Bisexuality, , Chicago, IL, University of Chicago Press; Angelides, S., Historicizing (bi)sexuality (2006) Journal of Homosexuality, 52 (1-2), pp. 125-158; Baker, P., (2005) Public Discourses of Gay Men, , London, Routledge; Baker, P., (2010) Sociolinguistics and Corpus Linguistics, , Edinburgh, Edinburgh University Press; Baker, P., (2014) Using Corpora to Analyze Gender, , London, Bloomsbury; Baker, P., Gabrielatos, C., McEnery, T., (2013) Discourse Analysis and Media Attitudes: The Representation of Islam in the British Press, , Cambridge, Cambridge University Press; Butler, J., (1991) Gender Trouble: Feminism and the Subversion of Identity, , New York, Routledge; Du Plessis, M., Blatantly bisexual; or, unthinking queer theory (1996) Representing Bisexualities: Subjects and Cultures of Fluid Desire, pp. 19-54. , Pramaggiore M., Hall D.E., (eds), New York, NYU Press, In:, (eds; Fairclough, N., (1989) Language and Power, , London, Longman; Foucault, M., (1972) The Archaeology of Knowledge, , London, Tavistock Publications; Foucault, M., (1978) The Will to Knowledge: The History of Sexuality, 1. , London, Penguin Books; hooks, B., (1992) Black Looks: Race and Representation, , Boston, MA, South End Press; Johnson, H., Bisexuality, mental health, and media representation (2016) Journal of Bisexuality, 16 (3), pp. 378-396; Kilgarriff, A., Rychly, P., Smrz, P., Itri-04-08 the sketch engine (2004) Information Technology, 105, p. 116; Kaestle, C., Ivory, A., A forgotten sexuality: Content analysis of bisexuality in the medical literature over two decades (2012) Journal of Bisexuality, 12 (1), pp. 35-48; Kilgarriff, A., Kovář, V., Krek, S., A quantitative evaluation of word sketches (2010) Proceedings of the 14th EURALEX International Congress, pp. 372-379; MacDowall, L., Historicising contemporary bisexuality (2009) Journal of Bisexuality, 9 (1), pp. 3-15; McEnery, T., Baker, H., (2017) Corpus Linguistics and 17th-Century Prostitution: Computational Linguistics and History, , London, Bloomsbury, (, a; McEnery, T., Baker, H., The public representation of homosexual men in seventeenth-century England – A corpus based view (2017) Journal of Historical Sociolinguistics, 3 (2), pp. 197-217. , (, b; (2018) s.v.

The validity of these assumptions is first empirically tested with a group of 10 male informants and then those implied meanings are bundled into thematic cores for their qualitative and quantitative description. Findings reveal that these ads still rely on stereotypical constructs and traditional discourses of what it takes to be a man. For example, men are invited to consume grooming products but reminded to do it the men’s way. Men are also reminded of their sexual power to seduce and attract women with the aid of the product. Likewise, by portraying male ad personae in traditional manly activities while emphasizing their toughness and body strength, or their resourcefulness when faced with challenging situations, the ads portray a rather skewed view of contemporary men, which fails to take into account the myriad roles a modern man can play in contemporary societies. © The Author(s) 2018.","male identities-implied meanings-semiotic analysis-stereotyped portrayals-grooming products",,,,,,,,,"Alexander, S.M., Stylish hard bodies: Branded masculinity in Men’s Health magazine (2003) Sociological Perspectives, 46, pp. 535-554;

Using a corpus of 2321 texts collected from five Turkish daily newspapers, concordances of the words Syrian, refugee and asylum seeker were examined and grouped along patterns through which discourses on and around Syrian asylum seekers were uncovered. We found differing discourses that framed asylum seekers as ‘our brothers’, ‘victims’, ‘needy people’ and/or ‘threat’, ‘criminals’ and so on. Newspapers maintained one or a combination of these discourses to construct their own reality about the refugee crisis in Turkey. The analysis also reveals that Turkish newspapers use pertinent terms interchangeably, leading to an ambiguity which reflects the political as well as daily usage of the terms. © The Author(s) 2018.","Asylum seekers; refugees; representation; Syria; Turkey; Turkish newspapers",,,,,,"TÃ¼rkiye Bilimsel ve Teknolojik AraÅtirma Kurumu, TÃBITAK: 115K268","This article uses part of the findings of the research project titled ‘Representation of Syrian Asylum Seekers in the Turkish Press (RoSR)’, funded by the TUBİTAK.

The representation of Syrian asylum seekers was examined in the five most circulated daily newspapers (Hürriyet, Sabah, Sözcü, Posta and Zaman) of the time using a combination of corpus linguistics (CL), critical discourse and semiotic analyses.

Many studies on this topic have focused on the question of whether this debate ‘militarized’ LGB people. This study takes a broader view, tracking five rhetorical archetypes (the Gay Warrior, the Gay Spoiler, the Gay Victim, the Gay Family Member and the Gay Activist) through two US Congressional Hearings. I identify and track these archetypes using a coding procedure that draws on concepts from Membership Categorization Analysis, rhetorical theory, discourse analysis and elsewhere. The result is a holistic picture of how LGB people were represented across the hearings. While they were increasingly associated with military values in the later hearing, they were also less often represented as victims, spoilers or activists in a negative sense. These findings offer additional insights into how the meanings-in-use of identity categories are changed in discourse. © The Author(s) 2018.","Discourse analysis; identity categories; LGBTQ rights; membership categorization; military service; rhetorical analysis; rhetorical archetypes; U.S. congressional hearings",,,,,,"Carnegie Mellon University, CMU","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/ or publication of this article: This essay was adapted from a portion of the author’s dissertation, which was completed under the supervision of Linda Flower, Barbara Johnstone and Andreea Ritivoi, and supported by a Dissertation Completion Fellowship from the Dietrich College of Humanities and Social Sciences at Carnegie Mellon University.",,"Adam, E.M., Cooper, B.L., Equal rights vs. special rights: Rights discourses, framing, and lesbian and gay antidiscrimination policy in Washington state (2017) Law & Social Inquiry, 42 (3), pp. 830-854; Allsep, L.M., The myth of the warrior: Martial masculinity and the end of Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell (2013) Journal of Homosexuality, 60 (2-3), pp. 381-400; Antaki, C., Widdicombe, S., Identity as an achievement and as a tool (1998) Identities in Talk, pp. 1-14. , Antaki C., Widdicombe S., (eds), Thousand Oaks, CA, Sage Publications, In:, (eds; Asen, R., Imagining in the public sphere (2002) Philosophy & Rhetoric, 35 (4), pp. 345-367. , (, a; Asen, R., (2002) Visions of Poverty: Welfare Policy and Political Imagination (Rhetoric and Public Affairs Series), , East Lansing, MI, Michigan State University Press; Asen, R., Reflections on the role of rhetoric in public policy (2010) Rhetoric & Public Affairs, 13 (1), pp. 121-143; Baker, P., (2005) Public Discourses of Gay Men, , (Routledge Advances in Corpus Linguistics).

Analysis of audio- and video-recorded data from racially diverse business members of two Texas chambers of commerce illustrates how chamber members indirectly index neoliberal ideology through taking stances toward government policies. White, upper class participants display neoliberal stances through using complaints – constituted by questions, humor, idioms and inference-rich terms – about the Affordable Care Act because it is a form of government interference that increases taxes and the federal deficit. Minority business members use discursive strategies such as double-voiced discourse and self-repairs to balance tensions between criticizing neoliberal ideology because it does not benefit minorities yet still orient to its taken-for-granted value in their business community. Overall, while participants’ interactions generally seem to operate within the structural constraints of neoliberal ideology, our analysis illustrates how participants take up neoliberal ideology in situated ways that, at times, provide avenues for negotiating the relevance of neoliberal ideology to everyday life. © The Author(s) 2018.","Complaints; discourse analysis; double-voiced discourse; idioms; institutional talk; neoliberal ideology; political identity; race; Texas",,,,,,,,,"Artz, L., Animating transnational capitalism (2015) Journal of Intercultural Communication Research, 44 (2), pp. 93-107; Bailey, B., The language of multiple identities among Dominican Americans (2000) Journal of Linguistic Anthropology, 10 (2), pp. 190-223; Bakhtin, M.M., (1981) The Dialogic Imagination: Four Essays by MM Bakhtin, , Austin, TX, University of Texas Press; Bassiouney, R., Politicizing identity: Code choice and stance-taking during the Egyptian revolution (2012) Discourse & Society, 23 (2), pp. 107-126; Beach, W.A., Transitional regularities for ‘casual’ ‘Okay’ usages (1993) Journal of Pragmatics, 19 (4), pp. 325-352; Bennett, J., Moralising class: A discourse analysis of the mainstream political response to Occupy and the August 2011 British riots (2013) Discourse & Society, 24 (1), pp. 27-45; Billig, M., MacMillan, K., Metaphor, idiom and ideology: The search for ‘no smoking guns’ across time (2005) Discourse & Society, 16 (4), pp. 459-480; Breeze, R., Legitimation in corporate discourse: Oil corporations after Deepwater Horizon (2012) Discourse & Society, 23 (1), pp. 3-18; Brown, R., Gilman, A., The pronouns of power and solidarity (1960) Style in Language, pp. 253-276. , Sebeok T.A., (ed), Cambridge, MA, The MIT Press, In:, (ed; Bucholtz, M., You da man: Narrating the racial other in the production of white masculinity (1999) Journal of Sociolinguistics, 3 (4), pp. 443-460; Bucholtz, M., Hall, K., Identity and interaction: A sociocultural linguistic approach (2005) Discourse Studies, 7 (4-5), pp. 585-614; Buttny, R., Morris, G.H., Accounting (2001) The New Handbook on Language and Social Psychology, pp. 285-302. , Robinson W.P., Giles H., (eds), Malden, MA, Wiley, In:, (eds; Cammaerts, B., Neoliberalism and the post-hegemonic war of position: The dialectic between invisibility and visibilities (2015) European Journal of Communication, 30 (5), pp. 522-538; Carbaugh, D., (1988) Talking American: Cultural Discourses on Donahue, , Norwood, NJ, Ablex Publishing Corporation; Chiapello, E., Fairclough, N., Understanding the new management ideology: A transdisciplinary contribution from critical discourse analysis and new sociology of capitalism (2002) Discourse & Society, 13 (2), pp. 185-208; Clayman, S.E., Heritage, J., Questioning presidents: Journalistic deference and adversarialness in the press conferences of U.S. presidents eisenhower and reagan (2002) Journal of Communication, 52 (4), pp. 749-775; Couldry, N., (2010) Why Voice Matters: Culture and Politics after Neoliberalism, , Thousand Oaks, CA, SAGE; Drew, P., Holt, E., Complainable matters: The use of idiomatic expressions in making complaints (1988) Social Problems, 35 (4), pp. 398-417; Du Bois, J.W., The stance triangle (2007) Stancetaking in Discourse: Evaluation, Interaction, pp. 139-182. , Englebretson R., (ed), Amsterdam, John Benjamins, In:, (ed; Eckert, P., Rickford, J.R., (2001) Style and Sociolinguistic Variation, , Cambridge, Cambridge University Press; Ehrlich, S., Freed, A., The function of questions in institutional discourse: An introduction (2010) Why Do You Ask?

The analysis focusses on when the customer requests a price, what that implies as well as how the price discussion is conducted. Marketing literature usually considers product/service price to be an obstacle that the salesperson needs to overcome; we demonstrate that the price question is a positive signal for the salesperson. By requesting the price, the customer claims sufficient understanding of the offer, recognition of the service value and a readiness to move to the next phase in the meeting. The salesperson initiates an insert expansion to tailor the price to her or his customer and then informs the price in an expanded clausal response to build customer value. The conversation analytic study was based on a dataset of 13 video-recorded B2B sales meetings in Finland. © The Author(s) 2018.","Business meetings; conversation analysis; customer interaction; industrial marketing; institutional interaction; questions; sales encounters; service price; software-as-a-service",,,,,,"3751/31/2015","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/ or publication of this article: This research was partly funded by Business Finland (project number 3751/31/2015).",,"Atkinson, J.M., Heritage, J., (1984) Structures of Social Action, , Cambridge, Cambridge University Press; Bolden, G., Robinson, J., Soliciting accounts with why-interrogatives in conversation (2011) Journal of Communication, 61 (1), pp. 94-119; Clark, C., Drew, P., Pinch, T., Managing customer ‘objections’ during real-life sales negotiations (1994) Discourse & Society, 5 (4), pp. 437-462; Clark, C., Drew, P., Pinch, T., Managing prospect affiliation and rapport in real-life sales encounters (2003) Discourse Studies, 5, pp. 5-31; Couper-Kuhlen, E., Prosody and sequence organization in English conversation: The case of new beginnings (2004) Sound Patterns in Interaction: Cross-Linguistic Studies from Conversation, pp. 335-376. , Couper-Kuhlen E., Ford C., (eds), Amsterdam, John Benjamins, In:, (eds; Drew, P., Comparative analysis of talk-in-interaction in different institutional settings: A sketch (2002) Excavating the Taken-for-Granted: Essays in Language and Social Interaction, pp. 293-308. , Glenn P.J., LeBaron C.D., Mandelbaum J.S., (eds), Mahwah, NJ, Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, In:, (eds; Dubinsky, A.J., A factor analytic study of the personal selling process (1981) Journal of Personal Selling & Sales Management, 1, pp. 26-33; Erringer, A., (1996) The functions of demonstrative adjectives semmoinen, tämmöinen and tuommoinen in Finnish Conversations, , MA Thesis, University of Colorado, Boulder, CO; Fox, B.A., Heinemann, T., The alignment of manual and verbal displays in requests for the repair of an object (2015) Research on Language and Social Interaction, 48 (3), pp. 342-362; Grönroos, C., Value co-creation in service logic: a critical analysis (2011) Marketing Theory, 11 (3), pp. 279-301; Hakulinen, A., English abstract on the different roles of word order (1975) Virittäjä, 79 (1), pp. 85-93. , [,]; Hakulinen, A., Vilkuna, M., Korhonen, R., (2004) Iso suomen kielioppi (The Comprehensive Grammar of Finnish), , Helsinki, Finnish Literature Society, [,]; Halonen, M., Koivisto, A., [Four fifty.

However, counter to common belief that scripted communication is well-controlled and homogeneous in its execution, observation of actual talk reveals interesting patterns and variations that reflect the ways in which participants make meaning of and perform their respective roles within the interaction towards achieving the overall goal of the service communication. Applying the analysis of speech functions and sequential order of talk in audio-recorded verbal exchanges between servers and customers at the service counter of a fast-food restaurant, acts in the fast-food service interaction are interpreted and explained in relation to management-prescribed service script, servers’ script-in-use and customers’ script within an institutional discourse framework.

This article focuses on two related textual aspects: how consumers are discursively construed and how conditional constructions are used in order to persuade and convince consumers of the adequacy of the hotel. The framework adopted for the analysis combines Stern’s notion of ‘implied consumer’ with a corpus-driven approach. The corpus data comprises 114 British hotel websites and totals half a million words. This is a subcorpus of COMETVAL, a database compiled at the University of València. The results reveal the importance of a number of words that address consumers directly or indirectly. These words intertwine with others to form patterns that help establish a bond between hoteliers and their clients. Further exploration of the corpus confirmed that some conditional sequences such as if you and should you are used by advertisers to speculate about the needs and wishes of consumers that the hotel can fulfil for them. The analysis suggests that conditional structures are a distinctive discursive characteristic strongly associated with the dialogic nature of the discourse hotel websites. © The Author(s) 2018.","Advertising; British hotel websites; conditional constructions; corpus linguistics; implied consumer; promotional and non-promotional discourse; tourism",,,,,,,,,"Akatsuka, N., Conditionals are discourse-bound (1986) On Conditionals, pp. 333-352. , Traugott E.C., (ed), Cambridge, Cambridge University Press, In:, (ed; Anthony, L., (2017) AntConc, , http://www.laurenceanthony.net/, Tokyo, Japan, Waseda University, (Version 3.5.0.

We examine the use of metaphor in narratives contributed to an online forum for Spanish speakers afflicted with various types of cancer. Specifically, we identify, quantify and discuss three categories of metaphors: violence, journey and other. Our study expands prior work on cancer communication by examining a language other than English, by focusing on how cancer victims communicate among themselves, and by examining how cancer narratives discuss concerns about personal experiences with this disease. Research thus far has focused on English. The work also expands on what is known about how people use the metaphor ‘in the wild’. © The Author(s) 2018.","Blogs; cancer communication; medical discourse; metaphor; Spanish narratives",,,,,,,,,"Armstrong, L., (2000) It’s Not about the Bike: My Journey Back to Life, , New York, G.P.

The data come from two purpose-built corpora. One comprises all the forum messages posted on the flag ship crypto-drug market Silk Road during the years in which it traded on the hidden net (c. 250 million words). The other corpus comprises all the reports published by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) during the same period (c. 153,000 words). Our analysis of trust focuses on the identities of those buying and selling drugs. The findings reveal that the Silk Road community members (a) regularly discussed vendors’ identities alongside a continuum of trust–risk calculation, explicitly identifying both ‘good’ and ‘bad’ practices and hence engaging in self-regulatory discourses, and (b) mainly constructed drug users’ identities in relation to values of expertise, integrity and benevolence. The findings also suggest that hard law enforcement activity, such as crypto-drug market closure, may encourage technological innovation within these markets. Moreover, our results show a disconnect between the discursive reality of the policy-making documents we examined and the very crypto-drug markets that they seek to legislate. © The Author(s) 2018.","Crypto-drug markets; discourse; drug policy making; drug user; drug vendor; escrow; Silk Road; trust",,,,,,"Swansea University

Despite affecting one in 10 women, the worldwide average diagnosis time is 7.5 years, and it is mainly diagnosed when exploring infertility rather than complaints about incapacitating pain and other associated manifestations. The aim of this article is to identify dis/empowerment caused by discourses in the healthcare and social environment of women as manifested in their accounts of endometriosis experiences. Having been informed and shaped by a corpus analysis of online forum data, this work explores accounts collected through interviews with women who have endometriosis using discourse analytical tools. Through an examination of the dialectics between micro-level language choices inscribing agency, or lack of, and macro-level discourses in the contexts in which women interact, the findings indicate that disempowerment is mostly a consequence of the perceived lack of agency over achieving diagnosis and knowledge of the condition in order to understand and learn coping strategies. The article concludes with implications for endometriosis communication practices and suggestions for broader enquiries in the field. © The Author(s) 2018.","Appraisal; dis/empowerment; discourse; endometriosis; illness; metaphor",,,,,,"Manchester Metropolitan University, MMU","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/ or publication of this article: The author received support from The Centre for English, Language and Linguistics and the Department of Languages, Information and Communications at the Faculty of Arts and Humanities, Manchester Metropolitan University.",,"Acién, P., Velasco, I., Endometriosis: A disease that remains enigmatic (2013) Obstetrics and Gynecology, , 30, May, Epub ahead of print; Archer, D., Does frequency really matter?

Building on a critical discourse perspective employing corpus-based text analysis methods, the composition of news discourses about cybervictimisation are analysed, alongside the relationship between such representations and news media discourse on crime victimisation generally. The aim is to see what effect the presence of a digital dimension has for how the notion of victimisation is socially and culturally understood. The study shows, first, that news reporting on cybervictimisation has a strong bias towards crimes that fit well with the notion of ‘the ideal victim’ (such as sexual victimisation and bullying) while excluding other types like hacking and identity theft. The question is raised whether ‘victim’ discourse is able to account for the latter types or if new understandings and concepts will emerge. Second, the study shows that discourses promoting understandings of technology as contributing to amplifying danger, and that represent technology as potentially undermining social order, are strong in cybervictimisation news reports. These discourses are consequential for who is seen as a legitimate victim and not. Just as it can be very difficult to identify and apprehend perpetrators of cybercrime, so is also the identification and definition of cybervictims ambiguous and demands to be further researched. © The Author(s) 2018.","CDS; Internet; topic modelling; victimisation",,,,,,,"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/ or publication of this article: This research was supported by The Swedish Crime Victim Compensation and Support Authority.",,"Afful-Dadzie, E., Afful-Dadzie, A., Liberation of public data: Exploring central themes in open government data and freedom of information research (2017) International Journal of Information Management, 37 (6), pp. 664-672; Albert, R., Jeong, H., Barabási, A.-L., Diameter of the world-wide web (1999) Nature, 401 (6749), pp. 130-131; Baker, P., (2006) Using Corpora in Discourse Analysis, , London, Bloomsbury Publishing; Baker, P., Gabrielatos, C., KhosraviNik, M., A useful methodological synergy?

First, patterns of contextualisation of images and text in the online magazines Dabiq and Rumiyah produced by the Islamic extremist organisation which refers to itself as Islamic State (referred to here as ISIS) are examined. The second data set consists of a sample of texts from Western online news and blog sites which include recontextualisations of images found in the first data set. A sample of examples of the use and re-use of images is discussed in order to identify patterns of similarity and difference when images and text are recontextualised. It is argued that the ISIS material tends to foreground the interpersonal metafunction in combination with the textual metafunction (i.e. the stance towards the content and the organisation of the message for this purpose), while the other data set tends to foreground the ideational metafunction (the participants, processes and circumstances of what is being reported). These inferences indicate that further exploration of a larger data set is worth pursuing. Such studies would provide deeper insights helping to distinguish between online material which supports terrorism and that which opposes it, as well as facilitating the further development of multimodal social semiotic approaches to image and text relations. © The Author(s) 2018.","Image and text relations; ISIS; jihad; multimodal discourse analysis; social semiotics",,,,,,,,,"Bateman, J., Looking for what counts in film analysis: A programme of empirical research (2014) Visual Communication, pp. 301-329. , Machin D., (ed), Berlin, De Gruyter Mouton, In:, (ed; Halliday, M.A.K., (1978) Language as Social Semiotic, , London, Edward Arnold; Halliday, M.A.K., (1994) An Introduction to Functional Grammar, , 2nd edn., London, Edward Arnold; Halliday, M.A.K., Matthiessen, C., (2014) Halliday’s Introduction to Functional Grammar, , London; New York, Routledge; Kress, G., Van Leeuwen, T., (2006) Reading Images: The Grammar of Visual Design, , 2nd edn., London, Routledge; Martin, J.R., Stenglin, M., Materialising reconciliation: Negotiating difference in a transcolonial exhibition (2007) New Directions in the Analysis of Multimodal Discourse, pp. 215-238. , Royce T., Bowcher W., (eds), Mahwah, NJ, Lawrence Erlbaum, In:, (eds; Martin, J.R., Rose, D., (2003) Working with Discourse: Meaning beyond the Clause, , London; New York, Continuum; Martinec, R., Salway, A., A system for image–text relations in new (and old) media (2005) Visual Communication, 4 (3), pp. 337-371; O’Halloran, K.L., Systemic Functional Multimodal Discourse Analysis (SF-MDA): Constructing ideational meaning using language and visual imagers (2008) Visual Communication, 7 (4), pp. 443-475; O’Halloran, K.L., Tan, S., Wignell, P., Intersemiotic translation as resemiotisation: A multimodal perspective (2016) SIGNATA Annales Des Semiotiques/Annals of Semiotics, 7, pp. 199-229. , (, a; O’Halloran, K.L., Tan, S., Wignell, P., SFL and multimodal discourse analysis The Cambridge Handbook of Systemic Functional Linguistics, , Thompson G., Bowcher W.L., Fontaine L., (eds), Cambridge, Cambridge University Press, (in press), In:, (eds; O’Halloran, K.L., Tan, S., Wignell, P., Interpreting text and image relations in violent extremist discourse: A mixed methods approach for big data analytics (2016) Terrorism and Political Violence, , 18, October, (, b), Epub ahead of print; O’Halloran, K., Tan, S., Wignell, P., Multimodal recontextualisations of images in violent extremist discourse (2017) The Art of Multimodality: Social Semiotic and Discourse Research in Honour of Theo Van Leeuwen, , Zhao S., Djonov E., Björkvall A., (eds), New York; London, Routledge,.

Research has suggested that a participant’s engagement in the decision-making process has direct relevance to his or her role(s) in the team or organization. This study extends the investigation of communicative behavior in decision-making to a special meeting setting where all participants assume similar organizational roles and where there is no designated chair. In particular, it draws on conversation analytic methods and a recently developed framework of participant roles to examine discursive strategies and discourse roles on a moment-by-moment basis in the process of consensus negotiation. Findings show that participants’ choices of discursive strategies and the display of discourse roles vary as the discussion proceeds. A limited range of discursive strategies and discourse roles are identified when the discussion fails to lead to consensus. Our analysis also suggests that certain discourse roles appear to have a greater impact on reaching consensus decisions. © The Author(s) 2018.","Business meetings without designated chairs; conversation analysis; decision-making; discourse analysis; discourse roles; negotiating consensus; participant roles",,,,,,"City University of Hong Kong, CityU","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/ or publication of this article: This article is based on two research grants (GRF Project #9041451) funded by the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) and by the CLASS Research Writing Fund Project #9618006 at the City University of Hong Kong.

Accordingly, photographs of disability could shape our cultural perceptions about disability and disabled persons. In response to this position, we engage in a critical semiotic inquiry into press photographs of disability (N = 1002) from The Star, a Malaysian mainstream English newspaper. We adapted Van Leeuwen’s (2008) social and visual actor networks to understand the visual techniques employed in depicting disabled actors in these images. The depiction is examined in relation to their absence and/or presence in these published photographs. If absent, the inclusion of non-disabled is analyzed. When present, the social categorizations of roles, grouping and specific/generic depictions are investigated. Findings reveal disabled persons have been symbolically excluded and thus, socially othered. These exclusionary strategies imply disabling journalistic practices which should be cautioned as they could could potentially undermine the advocacy for an inclusive society. © The Author(s) 2018.","Critical disability studies; critical discourse analysis; critical semiotics; discourses of disability; exclusionary practice; news photographs; photojournalism; visual actors",,,,,,"PGRF42638593

Variously referred to as equivocation, evasion, obfuscation, strategic ambiguity and topic avoidance, among other terms, the concept has a rich history in the communication literature. Covertly dodging questions presents serious social and political problems. This essay focuses on theoretical issues of dodging, specifically the ability for a person to change the subject with an irrelevant answer. Discussion primarily draws upon Grice’s theory of conversational implicature and deception research inspired by Grice. Theoretical impediments to detecting dodges are discussed, as well as barriers to accuracy from the perspective of discourse analysts and societal perceptions. © The Author(s) 2018.","Conversational implicatures; dodging questions; equivocation; evasion; information manipulation theory; truth-default theory",,,,,,,,,"Afifi, T., Afifi, W., Morse, C., Adolescents’ avoidance tendencies and physiological reactions to discussions about their parents’ relationship (2008) Communication Monographs, 75 (3), pp. 290-317; Bavelas, J., Black, A., Bryson, L., Political equivocation: A situational explanation (1988) Journal of Language and Social Psychology, 7 (2), pp. 137-145; Bavelas, J., Black, A., Chovil, N., (1990) Equivocal Communication, , Newbury Park, CA, SAGE; Bickart, B., Morris, M., Ratneshwar, S., Does it pay to beat around the bush?

The analysis focuses on the linguistic forms and socio-pragmatic functions of this dark humour in the wake of the tragedy. We argue that the creative humorous posts are meant to communicate Internet users’ ideologies conceptualised as their true beliefs about the sociopolitical situation and that they are oriented primarily towards criticising terrorism-related themes, notably: inept security enforcement, radical Islam, political and public reactions and integration policies. The humour in the Italian posts is used as a means of displaying Internet users’ wit and attracting other users’ attention. © The Author(s) 2018.","Comments/posts; conversational humour; dark humour; ideology; Islamic terrorism; online news; social media",,,,,,,,,"Achter, P., Comedy in unfunny times: News parody and carnival after 9/11 (2008) Critical Studies in Media Communication, 25 (3), pp. 274-303; Aillaud, M., Piolat, A., Influence of gender on judgment of dark and non-dark humor (2012) Individual Differences Research, 10 (4), pp. 211-222; Al Zidjaly, N., Memes as reasonably hostile laments: A discourse analysis of political dissent in Oman (2017) Discourse & Society, 28 (6), pp. 573-594; Billig, M., Humour and hatred: The racist jokes of the Ku Klux Klan (2001) Discourse & Society, 12 (3), pp. 267-289; Billig, M., (2005) Laughter and Ridicule: Toward a Social Critique of Humour, , London, SAGE; Bucaria, C., Dubbing dark humor: A case study in audiovisual translation (2008) Lodz Papers in Pragmatics, 4 (2), pp. 215-240; Charteris-Black, J., (2011) Politicians and Rhetoric: The Persuasive Power of Metaphor, , 2nd edn., Basingstoke; New York, Palgrave MacMillan; Chovanec, J., Dynel, M., Researching interactional forms and participant structures in public and social media (2015) Participation in Public and Social Media Interactions, pp. 1-23. , Dynel M., Chovanec J., (eds), Amsterdam; Philadelphia, PA, John Benjamins Publishing Company, In:, (eds; Davey, L., (2013) Puppets of terror: The limits and opportunities of creating ambiguity about terrorists and terrorism through humor, , Poster session presented at IUPUI Research Day, Indianapolis, IN; Demjén, Z., Laughing at cancer: Humour, empowerment, solidarity and coping online (2016) Journal of Pragmatics, 101, pp. 18-30; Draitser, E., Sociological aspects of the Russian Jewish jokes of the exodus (2009) Humor, 7 (3), pp. 245-268; Dundes, A., At ease, disease: Aids jokes as sick humor (1989) American Behavioral Scientist, 30 (3), pp. 72-81; Dynel, M., Beyond a joke: Types of conversational humour (2009) Language and Linguistics Compass, 3 (5), pp. 1284-1299; Dynel, M., Isn’t it ironic?

The research examines discourse structures, such as language use that clearly or implicitly produces propositions of conflict and war, tribalism and hate-speech. Discursive strategies such as labelling, exaggeration, metaphor and contradiction applied by the group to produce ideological discourses of outrage are also analysed. Moreover, conflicting discourses produced by the Igbo politicians and factions of IPOB and other Biafra campaign groups are analysed in terms of their political implications to the overall self-determination efforts of the Biafra nation. The study concludes that the pragmatic implications of discourses that reflect opposing views, as well as varied ideological perspectives by group members, suggest that Biafra is a nation divided against itself and are a people incapable of the separate nation that they seek. © The Author(s) 2018.","Biafra;

These reports incorporate other discourses which indicate the presence of interdiscursivity. The article examines interdiscursivity in Malaysian CSR reports. It selects the CSR reports of 10 major corporations and pursues an interdiscursive analysis which involves four sequential stages. CSR reports contain discourses of public relations, sustainability, strategic management, compliance and financial accounting. Although the discourses are often multisemiotic, language maintains primacy in content, while image tends to exemplify or simplify content. These discourses constitute an interdiscursive profile, and it has central and auxiliary discourses. The central discourse is public relations discourse, and it promotes corporations helping and not harming society. The auxiliary discourses are sustainability, strategic management, compliance and financial accounting discourses, and these discourses mitigate the promotional focus. Interdiscursivity enables the primarily promotional CSR reports to not seem overtly promotional. The choice of discourses is probably influenced by coercive, mimetic and normative reasons. These discourses enhance the reliability of CSR reports because their disclosure is anchored to various CSR aspects, international or reporting practices and professional domains. Interdiscursivity helps to build stakeholders’ confidence in disclosure and, therefore, in corporations. It joins other functions in CSR reports to convey corporations as agents of positive social change. The article also probes the relationship between interdiscursivity and intertextuality and advances a matrix of intertextual–interdiscursive use. © The Author(s) 2018.","Corporate social responsibility; CSR reports; disclosure; interdiscursive analysis; interdiscursive profile; interdiscursivity; multisemiotic",,,,,,,,,"Bakan, J., (2005) The Corporation, , New York, Free Press; Baughn, C., Bodie, N., McIntosh, J., Corporate social and environmental responsibility in Asian countries and other geographical regions (2007) Corporate Social Responsibility and Environmental Management, 14 (4), pp. 189-205; Bhatia, V., (2004) Worlds of Written Discourse, , London, Continuum; Bhatia, V., Interdiscursivity in professional communication (2010) Discourse and Communication, 21 (1), pp. 32-50; Boxenbaum, E., Jonsson, S., Isomorphism, diffusion and decoupling (2008) The SAGE Handbook of Organizational Institutionalism, pp. 78-98. , Greenwood R., Oliver C., Suddaby R., (eds), London, SAGE, In:, (eds; (2017) Report, , http://www.bursamalaysia.com/market/sustainability/sustainabilityreporting/sustainability-reporting-guide-and-toolkits/, accessed 22 December 2017; (2016) Citizenship Report 2016, , Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, CIMB Group Holdings Berhad; Corona, I., Confidentiality at risk: The interdiscursive construction of international commercial arbitration (2011) Discourse and Communication, 5 (4), pp. 355-374; Crawford Camiciottoli, B., Earnings calls: Exploring an emerging financial reporting genre (2010) Discourse and Communication, 4 (4), pp. 343-359; Cutlip, S., Center, A., Broom, G., (2000) Effective Public Relations, , 8th edn., London, Prentice Hall; Dawkins, J., Corporate responsibility: The communication challenge (2004) Journal of Communication Management, 9 (2), pp. 108-119; Deegan, C., (2014) Financial Accounting Theory, , 4th edn., North Ryde, NSW, Australia, McGraw-Hill Education; Dess, G., Lumpkin, G., Eisner, A., (2012) Strategic Management, , 6th edn., New York, McGraw-Hill Irwin; (2016) Sustainability Report 2016, , Shah Alam, Malaysia, DiGi.Com Berhad; DiMaggio, P., Powell, W., The iron cage revisited: Institutional isomorphism and collective rationality in organizational fields (1983) American Sociological Review, 48 (2), pp. 147-160; Fage-Butler, A., Investigating interdiscursivity in hospital strategic plans using Foucauldian discourse analysis (2015) Hermes, 54, pp. 35-47; Fairclough, N., (1995) Media Discourse, , London, Hodder Arnold; Fairclough, N., (2006) Language and Globalization, , Oxon, Routledge; Fairclough, N., Critical discourse analysis and critical policy studies (2013) Critical Policy Studies, 7 (2), pp. 177-197; Felker, G., Malaysia’s development strategies (2015) Routledge Handbook of Contemporary Malaysia, pp. 133-147. , Weiss M., (ed), London, Routledge, In:, (ed; Frankental, P., Corporate social responsibility: A PR invention?

These French government policies have been highly criticized both within France and by international political and aid organizations. However, the analysis shows how these brutal, anti-humanitarian events became recontextualized in the Romanian Press to represent the French government’s actions as peaceful and consensual. In addition, the demonization of the Roma in the press serves as a strategy to continuously disassociate them from their Romanian counterparts. While there is a long history of discrimination against the Roma in Romania, these particular recontextualizations can be understood in the context of the Romanian government’s need to gloss over its failure to comply with the Schengen accession requirements and acquire full European Union (EU) membership. © The Author(s) 2018.","Camp evictions; Critical Discourse Analysis; France; Roma; Schengen",,,,,,,,,"Achim, V., (2004) The Roma in Romanian History, , Budapest, Central European University Press; Chased away: Forced evictions of Roma in Ile-de-France (2012) Amnesty International, , http://www.amnesty.eu/en/news/statements-reports/eu/discrimination/report-chased-away-forced-evictions-of-roma-in-ile-de-france-0654/, (, a; France: Protect against forced evictions (2012) Amnesty International, , https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2012/11/france-protect-against-forced-evictions/, 29, November, (, b; Q&A: France Roma expulsions (2010) BBC News, , http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-11027288; Beciu, C., Mădroane, I.D., Ciocea, M., Media engagement in the transnational social field: Discourses and repositionings on migration in the Romanian public sphere (2017) Critical Discourse Studies, 14 (3), pp. 256-275; Bhabha, J., Mirga, A., Matache, M., (2017) Realizing Roma Rights, , Philadelphia, PA, University of Pennsylvania Press; Bunescu, I., (2014) Roma in Europe: The Politics of Collective Identity Formation, , Farnham, Ashgate Publishing; Caldas-Coulthard, C.R., (1997) News as Social Practice: A Study in Critical Discourse Analysis, , Florianópolis, Brazil, Federal University of Santa Catarina Press; Castle, S., Bennhold, K., Dispute grows over France’s removal of Roma camps (2010) The New York Times, , http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/17/world/europe/17union.html, 16, September; Catalano, T., The denaturalization of Romanies in Italy: How language and image work together (2012) The International Journal of the Image, 2 (4), pp. 159-172; Cretu, G., Roma minority in Romania and its media representation (2014) Sfera Politicii, 22 (4-5), pp. 112-120; Delanty, G., Wodak, R., Jones, P., (2008) Identity, Belonging and Migration, , Oxford, Oxford University Press; Romania and the EU: Not ready for Schengen (2013) The Economist, , https://www.economist.com/blogs/easternapproaches/2013/03/romania-and-eu, 17, November; Erjavec, K., Media representation of the discrimination against the Roma in Eastern Europe: The case of Slovenia (2001) Discourse & Society, 12 (6), pp. 699-727; Census of forced evictions in living areas occupied by Roma (or persons designated as such) in France (2016) ERRC, , http://www.errc.org/cms/upload/file/france-second-quarter-census-of-forced-evictions-july-2016.pdf; (2017) Will Macron turn the tide on Roma evictions?

Although the term is not explicitly gendered, this study demonstrates that food advertising using otona becomes a conduit for the construction of gendered lifestyle formulations via consumption practices offering consumers entrance into a range of gendered adult life stage practices. Unlike the socially aspirational consumption practices described by Agha, the consumption of inexpensive otona-marked products, which cost the same as their non-otona-marked counterparts but are intended by commercial producers to be viewed by prospective consumers as more mature, is linked to the process of entering adulthood. However, whereas male performance of otona masculinity is shown in the commercials to be based on psychological maturity and economic and social independence, female performance of otona femininity is determined by the commercial producers and the product manufacturers to be based on successful performance of external beauty, sexuality and support of male social sphere members. This article shows how otona becomes a catch-all for aspirational gendered performance, arguing that terms like otona are particularly suited for normative gendered performance presentations. © The Author(s) 2018.","Advertising;

In this study, we examine the audio-recorded Q&A sections of applicant webinars delivered by a major philanthropic foundation in the United States, with a particular focus on the foundation representatives’ complex responses to audience members’ yes–no questions that seek specificity. Within a conversation analytic framework, we show how the practice of going general is engaged to manage the demands of being helpful to the individual questioner without appearing to guarantee a particular outcome while foregrounding the foundation’s principles and priorities for the broader audience.

This article investigates the construction of this ‘third space’ in the resultant ‘moral panic’ about undesired immigration from other EU countries and its potential drain on the social services of the United Kingdom and links it to Euroskeptic discourse in British media. The article uses construal operations from cognitive linguistics combined with critical discourse studies as a way of denaturalizing the discourse in online comments that focus on the Bulgarian/Romanian immigration issue which we then connect to anti-Roma discourse. Results reveal a view of the United Kingdom as contaminated by Roma and underscore the need for novel metaphors to be countered before they become entrenched and used as tools for political propaganda. © 2018, © The Author(s) 2018.","Brexit; immigration; metaphor/metonymy; online comments; Roma; United Kingdom",,,,,,,,,"Angermuller, J., Maingueneau, D., Wodak, R., (2014) The Discourse Studies Reader: Main Currents in Theory and Analysis, , Amsterdam, John Benjamins Publishing Company; Barrett, D., Swinford, S., Number of Bulgarian and Romanian migrant workers reaches record high (2014) The Telegraph, , http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/immigration/10648646/Number-of-Romanian-and-Bulgarian-migrant-workers-reaches-record-high.html, 19, February, accessed 10 March 2014; Bhabha, H., (1994) The Location of Culture, , London and New York, Routledge; Binns, A., Don’t feed the trolls!

Underpinned by critical discourse analysis, our purpose is to analyze the embedded ideologies in discursive practices within the UFSC/EBSERH public sphere, especially those perpetrated by the federal government’s bureaucratic means as to mystify reality, and also promote and legitimize dominant interests and actions with regard to the UH/UFSC’s affiliation to the EBSERH. We organized this analysis in five main categories: (1) staff shortage and the ideological use of the double standard policy, (2) the ideology of neo-liberalism and managerialism, (3) blame avoidance behavior and the ideological dispute between ideology and pragmatism, (4) the policy of terror and the fallacy of choice and (5) ideology of participationism. © 2018, © The Author(s) 2018.","Brazilian public universities; critical discourse analysis; decisions; deliberations; discourse; ideology; public sphere; university hospitals",,,,,,,,,"Bhaskar, R., (1989) The Possibility of Naturalism: A Philosophical Critique of the Contemporary Human Sciences, , Hemel Hempstead, Harvester Wheatsheaf; Böhm, S., (2006) Repositioning Organization Theory, , New York, Palgrave Macmillan; Chandler, J., Barry, J., Clark, H., Stressing academe: The wear and tear of the new public management (2002) Human Relations, 55 (9), pp. 1051-1069; Chouliaraki, L., Fairclough, N., Critical discourse analysis in organizational studies: Towards an integrationist methodology (2010) Journal of Management Studies, 47 (6), pp. 1211-1218; Clegg, S., Hardy, C., Introduction Organizations, organization and organizing (1996) Handbook of Organization Studies, pp. 1-16. , Clegg S., Hardy C., Lawrence T.B., (eds), London, SAGE, In:, (eds); Dunmire, P., ‘Emerging threats’ and ‘coming dangers’: Claiming the future for preventive war (2007) Discourse, War and Terrorism, pp. 19-44. , Hodges A., Nilep C., (eds), Amsterdam, John Benjamins Publishing Company, In:, (eds); Eagleton, T., (1991) Ideology: An Introduction, , London, New Left Books; Fairclough, N., (1989) Language and Power, , London, Longman; Fairclough, N., (1992) Discourse and Social Change, , Cambridge, Polity Press; Fairclough, N., Critical discourse analysis as a method in social scientific research (2001) Methods of Critical Discourse Analysis, pp. 121-138. , Wodak R., Meyer M., (eds), London, SAGE, In:, (eds), (Introducing Qualitative Methods series); Fairclough, N., (2003) Analysing Discourse: Textual Analysis for Social Research, , London, Routledge; Fairclough, N., Discourse analysis in organizational studies: The case for critical realism (2005) Organization Studies, 26 (6), pp. 915-939; Fairclough, N., Fairclough, I., (2012) Political Discourse Analysis: A Method for Advanced Students, , London, Routledge; Fairclough, N., Jessop, B., Sayer, A., Critical realism and semiosis (2002) Journal of Critical Realism, 5 (1), pp. 2-10; Fairclough, N., Mulderrig, J., Wodak, R., Critical discourse analysis (2011) Discourse Studies: A Multidisciplinary Introduction, pp. 357-378. , Van Dijk T.A., (ed), London, SAGE, In:, (ed.); Fournier, V., Grey, C., At the critical moment: Conditions and prospects for critical management studies (2000) Human Relations, 53 (1), pp. 7-32; Fraser, N., Rethinking the public sphere: A contribution to the critique of actually existing democracy (1990) Social Text, 1 (25-26), pp. 56-80; Granemann, S., Fundações estatais: projeto de Estado do capital (2011) Cadernos De Saúde, pp. 50-55. , Bravo M.I.S., Menezes J.S.B., (eds), Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, UFRJ, Rede Sirius, [, ].

Multimodal legitimation research, however, seems to be in need of a better conflation of the theoretical backgrounds of disciplines, such as narratology. This article focuses on the multimodal discourse of three political advertisements of the political party New Democracy, filmed for the needs of the Greek legislative election of January 2015. What is investigated is the multimodal means by which New Democracy’s president, and Prime Minister at the time, Antonis Samaras attempted to legitimise his candidacy. In this article, I use the six-layer framework proposed by Mackay for multimodal legitimation analyses and I argue that multimodal legitimation research can benefit and get enhanced from the use of narratology and its analytical categories, such as perspective. © 2018, © The Author(s) 2018.","Antonis Samaras; critical discourse studies; electoral discourses; Greece; Greek crisis; January 2015; legislative election; legitimation; multimodality; narratology; New Democracy; perspective; political advertising",,,,,,,,,"Anastasiades, G., (1993) Contemporary political history of Greece (1974–1992), , Athens, Malliaris Paideia; Angouri, J., Wodak, R., ‘They became big in the shadow of the crisis’: The Greek success story and the rise of the far right (2014) Discourse & Society, 25 (4), pp. 540-565; Boukala, S., Waiting for democracy: Political crisis and the discursive (re)invention of the ‘national enemy’ in times of ‘Grecovery’ (2014) Discourse & Society, 25 (4), pp. 483-499; Boukala, S., Dimitrakopoulou, D., The politics of fear vs. the politics of hope: analysing the 2015 Greek election and referendum campaigns (2016) Critical Discourse Studies, 14, pp. 39-55; Chouliaraki, L., The soft power of war: Legitimacy and community in Iraq war discourses (2005) Special Issue of Journal of Language and Politics, 4 (1), pp. 1-10; Day, N., (1999) Advertising: Information or Manipulation?, , Springfield, NJ, Enslow; Genette, G., (1972) Narrative Discourse: An Essay in Method, , Oxford, Blackwell; Georgakopoulou, A., Small stories transposition and social media: A micro-perspective on the ‘Greek crisis’ (2014) Discourse & Society, 25 (4), pp. 519-539; Heldman, C., Campaign advertising and American democracy.

Much of this debate is rooted in how opposing discourse clans, such as liberal and conservative ideologies, construct a narrative of nationhood around contested views of refugees. Examining mainstream and alternative media from a critical discourse analytic perspective, the article uncovers how two key narratives about the Syrian refugee crisis emerge when the media attempt to orient their respective audiences to government policy through the discursive formation of the American Dream. Drawing on aspects of historicity, linguistic and semiotic action, and social impact, the analysis of the data reveals a discursive fracas between a humanistic perspective on the crisis that exploits a banal understanding of the American Dream and a more dichotomous narrative that homogenises refugees as a threat to the American way of life. These observations add to the growing body of literature that questions the ways in which the media discursively shapes, and is shaped by, political ideologies. © 2018, © The Author(s) 2018.","American Dream; ideology; immigration; media discourse; nationalism; Syrian refugees; Trump",,,,,,,,,"Altman, A., A Syrian refugee story (2017) TIME Magazine, , http://time.com/a-syrian-refugee-story/, accessed 7 August 2017; Babin, B., America’s refugee program: A clear and present danger (2016) National Review, , www.nationalreview.com/article/439122/syrian-refugee-program-dangerous-americans-we-must-reform-it-now, 18, August, accessed 4 August 2017; Baker, P., McEnery, T., A corpus-based approach to discourses of refugees and asylum seekers in UN and newspaper texts (2005) Journal of Language and Politics, 4 (2), pp. 197-226; Basu, M., Strangers in a strange land: Refugees face hurdle to American Dream (2016) CNN, , http://edition.cnn.com/2016/06/20/world/world-refugee-day-vignettes/index.html, 20, June, accessed 3 July 2017; Bhatia, A., (2015) Discursive Illusions in Public Discourse: Theory and Practice, , New York, Routledge; Billig, M., (1995) Banal Nationalism, , London, SAGE; Burke, P., History as social memory (1989) History, Culture, and the Mind, , Butler T., (ed), New York, Basil Blackwell, In:, (ed.), :,. 97–113; Charteris-Black, J., (2004) Corpus Approaches to Critical Metaphor Analysis, , Basingstoke, Palgrave Macmillan; Cissel, M., Media framing: A comparative content analysis on mainstream and alternative news coverage of Occupy Wall Street (2012) The Elon Journal of Undergraduate Research in Communications, 3 (1), pp. 67-77; Fairclough, N., (1989) Language and Power, , New York, Longman; Gabrielatos, C., Baker, P., Fleeing, sneaking, flooding: A corpus analysis of discursive constructions of refugees and asylum seekers in the UK Press, 1996–2005 (2008) Journal of English Linguistics, 36 (1), pp. 5-38; Gal, S., Irvine, J.T., The boundaries of language and disciplines: How ideologies construct difference (1995) Social Research, 62 (4), pp. 967-1001; Gale, P., The refugee crisis and fear (2004) Journal of Sociology, 40 (4), pp. 321-340; Gosh, C., (2013) The Politics of the American Dream, , Basingstoke, Palgrave Macmillan; Hall, S., Introduction (1975) Paper Voices: The Popular Press and Social Change 1935–1965, , Smith A.C.H., (ed), London, Chatto and Windus, In:, (ed.); Haynie, D., Syrian refugees in Trump’s America (2016) USA News, , https://www.usnews.com/news/best-countries/articles/2016-12-19/syrian-refugees-in-the-us-maintain-hope-after-trumps-win, 19, December, accessed 31 July 2017; Hipp, V., Six ways Trump can show real leadership (and keep Americans safe) in the fight against radical Islam (2016) Fox News, , http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2016/12/21/six-ways-trump-can-show-real-leadership-and-keep-americans-safe-in-fight-against-radical-islam.print.html, 21, December, accessed 7 August 2017; Hochschild, J.L., (1995) Facing Up to the American Dream, , Princeton, NJ, Princeton University Press; Jayyusi, L., (1984) Categorization and the Moral Order, , Boston, MA, Routledge & Kegan Paul; Jordan, M., When Syria came to Fresno: Refugees test limits of outreached hand (2017) The New York Times, , https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/20/us/fresno-syrian-refugees.html?mcubz=3, 20, July, accessed 31 July 2017; Kansteiner, W., Finding meaning in memory: A methodological critique of collective memory studies (2002) History and Theory, 41, pp. 179-197; Lappin, A.D., Terror is only a symptom of a greater threat to Western civilization (2017) The American Spectator, , https://spectator.org/terror-is-only-a-symptom-of-a-great-threat-to-western-civilization/, 7, June, accessed 7 July 2017; Leudar, I., Nekvapil, J., Practical historians and adversaries: 9/11 revisited (2011) Discourse & Society, 22 (1), pp. 66-85; Loveluck, L., Trump’s executive order crushed A Syrian family’s dream: A Judge gave them hope (2017) The Washington Post, , www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2017/02/07/from-aleppo-to-america-a-syrian-odyssey/?utm_term=.955112a97870, 7, February, accessed 3 July 2017; McHugh, K., Refugees admit sex attack on disabled girl in Idaho (2017) Brietbart, , www.breitbart.com/big-government/2017/04/06/idaho-refugees-convicted-of-felonies-after-filming-sex-attack-on-disabled-child/, 6, April, accessed 7 August 2017; Marcus, L., Why do leftists hate America?

During this period, various employment and lifestyle opportunities have given rise to a growing Black middle class (BMC). Against this backdrop, the article draws upon an intersectional approach to corpus-assisted discourse studies in order to examine the construction of the BMC in a 1.4 million-word corpus composed of 20 mainstream Anglophone South African newspaper titles published between 2008 and 2014. With the help of the corpus tool AntConc, the article investigates the collocates of ‘black middle class’, ‘black diamonds’, ‘clever blacks’ and ‘coconuts’, classifying results according to semantic categories in order to provide an idea of the multiple but nuanced representations of the BMC in contemporary SA. The analysis finds several lexically rich moralizing and paternalistic discourses that, in accordance with an intersectional perspective, enact a complex pattern of strategies that are simultaneously exclusionary and inclusionary. © 2018, © The Author(s) 2018.","Black diamonds; black middle class; clever blacks; coconuts; corpus linguistics; critical discourse studies; intersectionality; metaphor; newspaper discourse; South Africa",,,,,,"National Kidney Foundation of South Africa: KIC160301159575

A concordance analysis of the term bike lanes in news media, blogs and online news comments helps to explain the variation in the indexical meanings of bike lanes between those who oppose and those who support bike lanes.

However, state structures remain relevant. With Brexit, the year 2016 featured an exemplary case in which the ongoing importance of nation states came to the fore. Preceding the British referendum to exit the European Union (EU), discourses of national identity were deployed to promote a vote for the anti-globalization campaign. It is against this background that this research investigates how the relationship between multinational corporations and nation states is constructed in news discourse. The underlying assumption is that news actively construct rather than merely reflects the nature of this relationship. Drawing on Social Actor Analysis and Transitivity as a theoretical framework, this study examines news coverage of the BP oil spill that occurred in the United States in 2010 but was caused by a multinational company headquartered in the United Kingdom. The main research question is ‘How does the media establish a link between multinational corporations and nation states?’. To address this central question, this study investigates how (1) corporate responsibility is assigned, (2) the role of the nation state is portrayed and (3) victim status is allocated in the news. Findings show that the nature of the problem is constructed differently according to diverging national interests or priorities of the two nations represented by the media sources analyzed. The study indicates that the discourse around British nationality emphasized in the political struggle around Brexit was already mobilized extensively in the years leading up to the referendum. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.","BP; corporate responsibility; multinational corporations; nation states; national identity; news discourse; social actor analysis; transitivity",,,,,,,,,"Ashlin, A., Ladle, R.J., Natural disasters and newspapers: Post-tsunami environmental discourse (2007) Environmental Hazards, 7, pp. 330-341; Bednarek, M., Caple, H., (2012) News Discourse, , London and New York, A & C Black; Bevitori, C., (2010) Representations of Climate Change: News and Opinion Discourse in UK and US Quality Press: A Corpus-assisted Discourse Study, , Bologna, Bononia University Press; Boykoff, M.T., (2011) Who Speaks for the Climate?

I argue that the televised national ceremonies should be approached as an example of multi-genre epideictic rhetoric, working up meanings through a hybrid combination of genres (speeches, poems, readings), author/animators and modes (speech, music, light, movement and silence). Epideictic rhetoric has often been depreciated as simply ceremonial ‘praise or blame’ speeches. However, given that the topics of praise/blame assume the existence of social norms, epideictic also acts to presuppose and evoke common values, in general, and a collective recognition of shared social responsibilities, in particular. My methodology draws on the Discourse-Historical Approach to Critical Discourse Analysis, given, first, its central prominence in analysing argumentative strategies in discourse and, second, the ways it facilitates a reflexive ‘shuttling’ between text-discursive features, intertextual relations and wider contexts of society and history. Here, I examine how a catastrophic past is invoked in speech and evoked through image and music, in response to the demands that uncertainty of the future ‘places upon one’s conscience’. © 2018, © The Author(s) 2018.","Commemoration; discourse-historic analysis; epideictic; Holocaust Memorial Day; multimodality; rhetoric",,,,,,"Leverhulme Trust","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/ or publication of this article: This research was funded by a Leverhulme Trust Research Fellowship.

The authors included in the corpus, who tend towards the left of the political spectrum, use metaphor to express moral judgements on the actions and decisions of the conservative, centre-right People’s party (Partido Popular or PP), which governs Spain with an overall majority. With the aim of describing this discourse, we have undertaken a qualitative analysis with a conceptual framework deriving from CDA and cognitive linguistics. First, therefore, we have made use of the methodology developed by Steen and the Pragglejaz group to extract the discourse units that could be considered as the lexical expression of an underlying mapping between domains, that is, the metaphors; second, according to the descriptions of Talmy, Croft, Sweetser, Sullivan, and Dancygier and Sweetser, we have verified that the different types of grammatical structure in which the lexical items appeared also indicated the existence of a metaphorical thought process; and third, in the words of van Dijk, we have studied the ideological semantics underlying conceptual structures and conceptual content. As we have demonstrated, all the samples of linguistic metaphors found led readers to construct the same interpretation of the meaning: The Spanish People’s party government is the past, a past that provokes rejection and which was thought to be definitively ended. © 2018, © The Author(s) 2018.","ACD; cognitive linguistics; conceptual content; conceptual structure; ideology; metaphor; mininarrative; political discourse; scenario",,,,,,,,,"Barcelona, A., La metonimia conceptual [Conceptual Metonymy] (2012) Lingüística Cognitiva, pp. 123-146. , Ibarretxe-Antuñano I., Valenzuela-Manzanares J., (eds), Madrid, Anthropos, In:, (eds), [Cognitive Linguistics]; Cameron, L., (2003) Metaphor in Educational Discourse, , London, Continuum; Cameron, L., Patterns of metaphor use in reconciliation talk (2007) Discourse & Society, 18, pp. 197-222; Cameron, L., Deignan, A., Combining large and small corpora to investigate tuning devices around metaphor in spoken discourse (2003) Metaphor and Symbol, 18 (3), pp. 149-160; Campos, H., Transitividad e intransitividad [Transitiveness and Intransitiveness] (1999) Gramática descriptiva de la lengua española, pp. 1519-1574. , Bosque I., Demonte V., (eds), Madrid, Espasa Calpe, In:, (eds), [A Descriptive Grammar of the Spanish Language]; Charteris-Black, J., (2004) Corpus Approaches to Critical Metaphor Analysis, , Basingstoke, Palgrave MacMillan; Chilton, P., (2004) Analyzing Political Discourse: Theory and Practice, , London, Routledge; Chilton, P., Missing links in mainstream CDA: Modules, blends and the critical instinct (2005) A New Agenda in (Critical) Discourse Analysis: Theory, Methodology and Interdisciplinarity, pp. 19-53. , Wodak R., Chilton P., (eds), Amsterdam, John Benjamins, In:, (eds); Chilton, P., Lakoff, G., Foreign policy by metaphor (1995) Language and Peace, pp. 37-59. , Schäffner C., Wenden A.L., (eds), Dartmouth, Aldershot,, In:, (eds); Cienki, A., The application of conceptual metaphor theory to political discourse: Methodological questions and some possible solutions (2008) Political Language and Metaphor.

However, these conversations between researcher and journalist have often largely been treated as a transfer of neutral, transparent information about news practice rather than a discursive practice in itself. Discourse analysis has been extensively applied to the output of news, yet is underdeveloped in the area of production studies. This article argues that a more discursive approach to news production studies yields a more nuanced understanding of journalistic culture and practice. This is illustrated by using the tools of discursive social psychology to analyse interviews with 23 broadcast journalists about the nature of news. The analysis helps with the identification of the use of empiricist discourse to construct a ‘natural’ journalism and to justify certain constructions of journalistic practice. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.","Discourse analysis; discursive social psychology; empiricist discourse; journalism; news production; television news",,,,,,,,,"Ahva, L., Public journalism and professional reflexivity (2012) Journalism, 14 (6), pp. 790-806; Allan, S., (1999) News Culture, , Buckingham, Open University Press; Bell, A., (1991) The Language of the News Media, , Oxford, Blackwell; Billig, M., (1991) Ideology and Opinions, , London, SAGE; Blommaert, J., (2005) Discourse: A Critical Introduction, , Cambridge, Cambridge University Press; Boyd, A., (2008) Broadcast Journalism: Techniques of Radio and TV News, , 6th edn., Amsterdam, Focal Press; Cameron, D., (2001) Working with Spoken Discourse, , London, SAGE; Catenaccio, P., Cotter, C., De Smedt, M., Towards a linguistics of news production (2011) Journal of Pragmatics, 43 (7), pp. 1843-1852; Conboy, M., (2006) Tabloid Britain: Constructing a Community through Language, , Abion, Routledge; Cotter, C., Discourse and media (2003) The Handbook of Discourse Analysis, pp. 416-436. , Schiffrin, Tannen, Hamilton, (eds), Oxford, Blackwell,.

However, the relevant literature has exclusively investigated Western news texts. In this study, we challenge the dominance of the inverted news structure by including a non-Western and less-investigated culture and ask whether textual structure of news texts can differ between cultural contexts. In total, 100 crime news texts from national Iranian and Dutch newspapers were analyzed for both the overall text and the journalists’ statements. Those texts that showed a hybrid structure (combining inverted pyramid and chronology) were subsequently studied qualitatively to understand how chronology is applied in them. News texts from the two cultures were significantly different in their structure. Qualitative analysis of the journalistic statements uncovered a quotation-based structure, a way of news writing in Iranian journalistic statements in which the journalist mainly narrates reporting eventualities that are new to Western eyes. The study offers implications for further ethnography of news and communication, suggesting that the role, pattern and effects of (journalistic) communication can be culture-specific. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.","Chronology; discourse analysis; hybrid news; Iranian news; news structure",,,,,,,,,"Ansary, H., Babaii, E., A cross-cultural analysis of English newspaper editorials: A systemic-functional view of text for contrastive rhetoric research (2009) RELC Journal, 40 (2), pp. 211-249; Badiee, N., Ghandi, H., (2016) Rʊ̈znɑmenegɑrɪye novɪn, , 10th edn., Tehran, Iran, Allɑme Tæbɑtæbɑyɪ University; Bell, A., (1991) The Language of News Media, , Oxford, Blackwell Publishers; Bell, A., The discourse structure of news stories (1998) Approaches to Media Discourse, pp. 64-104. , Bell, Garrett, (eds), Oxford, Blackwell Publishers,.

Data include documentation from classes and interviews with the presenters. This twofold dataset enables investigation into how ideologies of communication figure into the production of discourse. A dominant idea is that discourse can stand in for lived experience in the endeavor to decrease nervousness and fear in the expectant parents. The observation data are therefore analyzed by paying attention to how the expectant parents’ future deliveries are discursively represented. Drawing on the conceptual framework for analyzing anticipatory discourse, the study shows how the midwives largely frame this future as predictable and the mother as highly agentive. When addressing unexpected turbulence, however, the midwives use the opportunity to stress the agency of medical professionals to maintain a representation of the delivery event as generally predictable. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.","Anticipatory discourse; childbirth; health communication; ideologies of communication; language ideology; parental education; preparation",,,,,,,,,"Agha, A., Meet mediatization (2011) Language & Communication, 31 (3), pp. 163-170; Al Zidjaly, N., Disability and anticipatory discourse: The interconnectedness of local and global aspects of talk (2006) Communication & Medicine, 3 (2), pp. 101-112; Bauman, R., Briggs, C.L., Poetics and performance as critical perspectives on language and social life (1990) Annual Review of Anthropology, 19, pp. 59-88; Bourdieu, P., (1977) Outline of a Theory of Practice, , Cambridge, Cambridge University Press; Bredmar, M., (1999) Att göra det ovanliga normalt: Kommunikativ varsamhet och medicinska uppgifter i barnmorskors samtal med gravida kvinnor [Making the Unusual Normal.

Specifically, it investigates the interplay of ‘techno-optimism’ (a form of ideological bias) and propositional certainty in the NIC’s ‘Future Global Trends Reports’. In doing so, it answers the following questions: To what extent was techno-optimism present in the discourse? What level of propositional certainty was expressed in the discourse? How did the discourse deal with the inherent uncertainty of the future? Overall, the discourse was pronouncedly techno-optimist in its stance towards the future role of technology: high-technological solutions were portrayed as solving a host of problems, despite the readily available presence of low-technology or no-technology solutions. In all, 75.1% of the representations were presented as future categorical certainties, meaning the future was predominantly presented as a known and closed inevitability. The discourse dealt with the inherent uncertainty of the subject matter, that is, the future, by projecting the past and present into the future. This was particularly the case in relation to the idea of technological military dominance as a guarantee of global peace, and the role of technology as an inevitable force free from societal censorship. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.","Categorical certainties; futurological discourse; ideological bias; objective epistemic modality; possibilities; probabilities; relative certainties; techno-optimism; technology",,,,,,,,,"Abdi, R., Rizi, M.T., Tavakoli, M., The cooperative principle in discourse communities and genres: A framework for the use of metadiscourse (2010) Journal of Pragmatics, 42, pp. 1669-1679; Adam, B., (1995) Timewatch: The Social Analysis of Time, , Cambridge, MA, Polity Press; Alessandrini, A., Reading the future (2003) Culture Studies, 17 (2), pp. 211-229; Asayama, S., Catastrophism toward ‘opening up’ or ‘closing down’?

The selected debate sessions (Ondo Governorship Debate and Lagos Governorship Debate) are recovered from YouTube files and transcribed. However, only utterances from candidates in the two major political parties in Nigeria, namely, Action Congress of Nigeria (ACN) (now renamed All Progressives Congress (APC)) and the People’s Democratic Party (PDP), are subjected to content analysis. Context models in the aspects of discourse meaning and argumentation are also considered. Findings reveal that first, candidates’ utterances range from acclaims to attacks and defenses. Second, topics help to derive candidates’ ideologies which are further exemplified within the ambience of shared background knowledge (presupposition). Finally, candidates adopt legal/illegal jargons, explanations, statements of evidence, examples and illustrations to explicitly exemplify their mental dispositions and beliefs. We conclude by stating that candidates’ utterances were found to be relevant within the context of the debates and, by extension, the prevalent socio-political problems in Nigeria. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.","Campaign discourse; critical discourse analysis; gubernatorial debates; Nigeria; political communication; socio-cognition",,,,,,,,,"Abidi, M., Euphemism in Tony Blair’s political discourse in the Iraqi war 2003: A socio-cognitive CDA account (2015) International Journal of Humanities and Cultural Studies, 2 (1), pp. 8-28; Adekunle, A.S., (2011) A pragmatic analysis of President Goodluck Jonathan’s inaugural speech, Nigeria: Our nation in mourning, , University of Ilorin, Ilorin, Nigeria,.

Reports about the event in local Chinese media were remarkably different in stance and attitude. To understand the ideological dissonances and their linguistic construction, this article analyzes a corpus of 120 reports on the Occupy Central Movement from four major Chinese newspapers in Hong Kong, namely, Apple Daily, Ming Pao, Oriental Daily News and Ta Kung Pao, which cover the political spectrum from anti-Beijing to pro-Beijing. In total, 856 concordance lines of the two selected words (occupy Central) and (occupy) were annotated using the Attitude framework. Analysis shows that their attitudes toward the event form a continuum from supportive, through neutral, to antipathic. The attitudes do not simply reflect the stances of the newspapers, but are strategically selected and designed to legitimize or delegitimize the event. The pattern of attitudes reflects the ideological divergence in Hong Kong society, and at the same time, the news reports also exacerbate the divergence by reinforcing the attitudes of their readers. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.","Attitudes; Chinese-language newspapers; framing; Hong Kong; ideological dissonances; Occupy Central Movement",,,,,,"Hong Kong Polytechnic University, PolyU: G-YBCC","the occupiers’ positive attributes (moralization/ethos), which include their determination and perseverance in fighting for democracy, their sacrifice for the future of Hong Kong and the quality exhibited during the OCM. It also emphasizes the righteous nature of the OCM (rationalization/logos) and the support from citizens (authorization/pathos) to align its readers and to mobilize readers to join the movement. For TKP, the dominant attitudes are Affect, and the newspaper highlights the anger and frustration of people from all walks of life (authorization/pathos). It also highlights the disastrous damage caused by the OCM (rationalization/logos) and the selfishness of the occupiers (moralization/ethos) to strengthen readers’ antipathy toward the OCM. In terms of the construction of attitudes, TKP uses more strategies than other newspapers to delegitimize the OCM, including detailed representations of its damage, intensification and metaphor. For ODN, the most important delegitimization strategy is the negative Appreciation of the nature, purpose and consequence of the OCM (rationalization/logos). In comparison with AD and TKP, ODN avoids the Judgment of occupiers to maintain its objectivity. Finally, for MP, the reports are characterized by its neutral stance and impartiality. Compared with the other three newspapers, its reports are mostly factual and the OCM is not intentionally legitimized or delegitimized. Therefore, to varying degrees, the newspapers are not simply providing information, but are persuading readers to accept their biased version of reality through the strategic selection and design of attitudes.","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/ or publication of this article: The research for this paper was funded by Central Research Grant, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (Grant No.: G-YBCC).","(2007) On Rhetoric: A Theory of Civic Discourse, , 2nd edn., New York, Oxford University Press, (trans; Ashley, L., Olson, B., Constructing reality: Print media’s framing of the women’s movement (1998) Journalism & Mass Communication Quarterly, 75, pp. 263-277; Bednarek, M., (2006) Evaluation in Media Discourse: Analysis of a Newspaper Corpus, , London, Continuum; Bell, A., The discourse structure of news stories (1998) Approaches to Media Discourse, pp. 64-104. , Bell, Garrett, (eds), Oxford, Wiley-Blackwell,.

Using ideological discourse analytic tools, this article demonstrates how two prominent Russian TV channels shaped the persuasive message, creating strong unity and mobilizing a high level of support among the national audience. Based on legitimation and de-legitimation patterns, Channel One and Russia-1 built ideologically polarized opposition between ‘Our’ and ‘Their’ sides of the conflict. The wide range of editorializing tools, socio-cultural and historical Soviet-time constructs, and references to gay culture served to promote one group and to debase the opposition. Close institutional ties between government and media in Russia sustain multiplicity and intertextuality of ‘general line’, thus eliminating discordant interpretations. The article shows strong evidence that the analyzed TV news programs present a typical illustration of ideological discourse, exploited by the Russian government in order to achieve its political goals. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.","Critical discourse analysis; Euromaidan; framing; group polarization; hybrid war; ideological media discourse; legitimation; Russian media; Ukrainian crisis",,,,,,"Shell United States, Shell

Recently, offers of genetic testing have expanded from scientific and clinical genetic settings to general medicine (e.g. in hereditary cancer) and non-medical domains (e.g. aptitude tests). The wider availability of tests, however, has raised concerns about the currently available scientifically proven utility of these tests. Using theme-oriented discourse analysis, we analyse the specific discursive modalities through which the DTC companies in Hong Kong make inflated claims about the value of genetic tests to pursue their marketing agenda. We show that in this way the companies are selling ‘more’ than specific products to consumers: they are selling ‘hope’ and ‘increased autonomy’, that is, an opportunity to buy commodities online that promise consumers control of their health and wellbeing. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.","Commodification; direct-to-consumer genetic testing; discourse analysis; empowerment discourse; genetic determinism; genetic testing; marketisation; personalisation; websites",,,,,,"National Health and Medical Research Council","Deliberate misrepresentation or withholding of information about limitations of genetic testing carries the potential risk of litigation. Legal regulation of genetic testing, however, is still a grey area, not only in Hong Kong but also in other countries where genetic testing is more established. According to the National Human Genome Research Institute (2016) in the USA, genetic tests ‘go to market without any independent analysis to verify the claims of the seller’. Rafiq et al. (2015) have conducted a systematic review of position statements, guidelines and recommendations on the responsible provision of DTC genetic tests produced by professional organisations in 10 European countries. Their results have shown a similar lack of regulation of DTC organisations in European countries, and that the legislation on DTC genetic testing is largely fragmented and widely variable across different countries. They have also noted that regulations about the safety and quality of DTC genetic tests are still lacking. Despite the lack of formal legal regulations, various professional associations across the world (e.g. American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics, 2016; Australian Government National Health and Medical Research Council, 2014) have published statements and guidelines that seek to establish principles for the provision of genetic testing services directly to consumers. These organisations recommend that companies provide scientific evidence about the clinical validity and utility of genetic tests; disclose potential benefits, risks and limitations of undertaking genetic testing; use Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA)-certified laboratories; involve health professionals in the testing process; and provide genetic counselling to their clients (Lachance et al., 2010).",,"Agurs-Collins, T., Ferrer, R., Ottenbacher, A., Public awareness of direct-to-consumer genetic tests: Findings from the 2013 U.S. Health Information National Trends Survey (2015) Journal of Cancer Education, 30 (4), pp. 799-807; Direct-to-consumer genetic testing: A revised position statement of the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (2016) Genetics in Medicine, 18 (2), pp. 207-208; Arribas-Ayllon, M., Sarangi, S., Clarke, A., Promissory accounts of personalisation in the commercialisation of genomic knowledge (2011) Communication and Medicine, 8 (1), pp. 53-66; (2014) Direct-to-consumer genetic testing: A statement from the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC), , https://www.nhmrc.gov.au/_files_nhmrc/publications/attachments/g9_direct_to_consumer_genetic_testing_nhmrc_statement_141208.pdf, accessed 15 November 2016,. :; Bhatia, V.K., Generic patterns in promotional discourse (2005) Persuasion across Genres: A Linguistic Approach, pp. 213-225. , Halmari, Virtanen, (eds), Amsterdam, John Benjamins,.

Using the theoretical framework of critical discourse analysis, which approaches media as constructing rather than mirroring social reality and driven by the interests behind them, this article explores representations of Argentina’s last dictator, Leopoldo Galtieri, within broader discourses on nationalism in three newspapers that supported the regime. The methodological framework of the study is mixed, combining qualitative elements of the discourse-historical approach with corpus tools for an investigation into collocations and metaphors employed. Findings suggest that linguistic and discursive features used in relation to Galtieri change over the course of the year, reflecting shifting discourses on nationalism and Argentina’s period of socio-political crisis. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.","Argentina; corpus-assisted discourse studies; dictatorship; discourse analysis; discourse-historical approach; identity; ideology; media; nationalism",,,,,,"Irish Research Council","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/ or publication of this article: This work was supported by The Irish Research Council.",,"Achugar, M., Constructing the past and constructing themselves: The Uruguayan military’s memory of the dictatorship (2009) Critical Discourse Studies, 6 (2), pp. 283-295; Anderson, B., (1983) Imagined Communities, , London, Verso Books; Avellaneda, A., (1986) Censura, autoritarismo y cultura: Argentina, , Buenos Aires, Argentina, CEAL, ] 1960-1983/1; Baker, P., (2005) Public Discourses of Gay Men, , New York, Routledge; Baker, P., McEnery, T., ‘A corpus-based approach to discourses of refugees and asylum seekers in UN and newspaper texts (2005) Journal of Language and Politics, 4 (2), pp. 197-226; Baker, P., Gabrielatos, C., KhosraviNik, M., A useful methodological synergy?

We utilise a data set of harvested tweets gathered from a high-profile public ‘celebrity antagonist’ in order to systematically identify types of antagonistic formulation that have generated different levels of interest within the social media community and beyond. Drawing from classic ethnomethodological studies of banner headlines and other means of generating public interest and ‘making sense’, we respecify high-profile antagonistic tweets as category formulations that exhibit particular and regular membership category features that are reflexively bound to potential antagonistic readings, interest and controversy. In conclusion, we consider how such formulations may be understood to represent resources that constitute ignition points within antagonistic flows of communication and information that can be metaphorically understood as ‘digital wildfires’. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.","Antagonism; formulations; membership categorisation analysis; social media; texts; Twitter",,,,,,"Economic and Social Research Council, ESRC: ES/L013398/1, ES/K008013/1","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/ or publication of this article: This research received support from the ESRC (UK), grant numbers ES/K008013/1 and ES/L013398/1.",,"Atkinson, M., (1984) Our Masters’ Voices: The Language and Body Language of Politics, , London, Psychology Press; Atkinson, P., Housley, W., (2003) Interactionism, , London, SAGE; Boden, D., Zimmerman, D.H., (1991) Talk and Social Structure: Studies in Ethnomethodology and Conversation Analysis, , Berkeley, CA, University of California Press, (eds) (; Dutton, W.H., The fifth estate emerging through the network of networks (2009) Prometheus, 27 (1), pp. 1-15; Edwards, A., Housley, W., Williams, M., Digital social research, social media and the sociological imagination: Surrogacy, augmentation and re-orientation (2013) International Journal of Social Research Methodology, 16 (3), pp. 245-260; Eglin, P., Hester, S., Category, predicate and task: The pragmatics of practical action (1992) Semiotica, 88 (3-4), pp. 243-268; Fairclough, N., (2013) Critical Discourse Analysis: The Critical Study of Language, , London, Routledge; Fitzgerald, R., Housley, W., Identity, categorization and sequential organization: The sequential and categorial flow of identity in a radio phone-in (2002) Discourse & Society, 13 (5), pp. 579-602; Fitzgerald, R., Housley, W., (2015) Advances in Membership Categorisation Analysis, , London, SAGE, (eds) (; Fitzgerald, R., Housley, W., (2016) Media, Policy and Interaction, , London, Routledge, (eds) (; Garfinkel, H., (1967) Studies in Ethomethodology, , Prentice Hall,.

I have made a comparative analysis of two different political contexts to observe different social parameters at work: the current democratic system and the post-Spanish Civil War dictatorial regime. In both cases, they are exploited by third parties to validate a particular political stance. The analysis made in this work draws on Edwards’ ‘emotion in use’ and the lexical framework within Martin and White’s ‘appraisal model’. The way emigration is emotionally verbalized determines issues such as responsibility. Negative emotion remarks require some agent to be blamed, normally the government for its economic policies, whereas the positive ones have a reinforcement effect and work as a bonding mechanism to the system. Judgment and Affect are found to be interrelated. More specifically, and following Martin and White’s terminology, Affect may work as a graduation instrument in the expression of Judgment. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.","Appraisal; emigration; emotion(al) talk; politics; Spain; the media",,,,,,"FFI2013-47792-C2-1-P","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/ or publication of this article: This work was supported by the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness, through the Emo-Fundett project (FFI2013-47792-C2-1-P).",,"Alba-Juez, L., Evaluation in the headlines of tabloids and broadsheets: A comparative study (2017) Evaluation in Media Discourse: European Perspectives, pp. 81-120. , Breeze, Olza, (eds), Bern, Peter Lang,.

We combined discourse analysis and corpus-linguistic approaches to investigate the relationship between lexical items used by the students to express their attitudes toward Arab women and those featuring in news headlines about them published in British, American, and German news media. Results show that the portrayal of Arab women in Western news headlines has a clear impact on German students’ opinions of them. The findings also show that our participants tend to be aware of this effect, which could be partly due to their familiarity with discourse analysis as students of linguistics.

We draw on Strauss’ theory of negotiated order and a discourse analytical approach, seeking to gain insight into the complex accomplishment of making a decision in an inter-professional and multi-party setting. Working with data from 97 team meetings in a social work setting, we identify two patterns of negotiation in talk: expanding and postponing. ‘Expanding’ covers a group of interactional actions involving turn-taking and closure, while ‘postponing’ includes a group of actions whereby assessments or topics are avoided or made irrelevant. Both are examples of the complex ways in which team members negotiate both the institutional order and the decision to be made in the specific case in situ. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.","Decision making; expanding; meeting talk; multi-party interaction; negotiation order; postponing; social work",,,,,,,,,"Angouri, J., Managing disagreement in problem solving meeting talk (2012) Journal of Pragmatics, 44 (12), pp. 1565-1579; Angouri, J., Bargiela-Chiappini, F., ‘So what problems bother you and you are not speeding up your work?’ Problem solving talk at work (2011) Discourse & Communication, 5 (3), pp. 209-229; Baraldi, C., Forms of decision making: Gatekeeping and dialogic coordination in CISV organizational meetings (2013) Journal of Business Communication, 50 (4), pp. 339-361; Boden, D., (1994) The Business of Talk: Organizations in Action, , Cambridge, Polity Press; Drew, P., Heritage, J., (1992) Talk at Work: Interaction in Institutional Settings, , Cambridge, Cambridge University Press; Fine, G.A., Negotiated orders and organizational cultures (1984) Annual Review of Sociology, 10 (1), pp. 239-262; Griffiths, L., Accomplishing team: Teamwork and categorisation in two community mental health teams (1997) Sociological Review, 45 (1), pp. 59-78; Griffiths, L., Categorising to exclude: The discursive construction of cases in community mental health teams (2001) Sociology of Health & Illness, 23 (5), pp. 678-700; Gumperz, J., On interactional sociolinguistic method (1999) Talk, Work and Institutional Order: Discourse in Medical, Mediation and Management Settings, pp. 453-473. , Sarangi, Roberts, (eds), Berlin, Moutoe Gruyter,.

Specifically, I analyze 100 tweets that include #refugeesnotwelcome, and explore how this hashtag is used to express negative feelings, beliefs and ideologies toward refugees and (im)migrants in Europe. Guided by critical discourse studies, I focus on Twitter users’ discursive strategies as well as form and function of semiotic resources and multimodality. Twitter users who include this particular hashtag use a rhetoric of inclusion and exclusion to depict refugees as unwanted, criminal outsiders. These tendencies align with current trends in Europe where nationalist-conservative and xenophobic right-wing groups gain power and establish a socially accepted discourse of racism. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.","Critical discourse studies; discursive strategies; European migrant crisis; hashtag; ideologies; political online discourse; racist discourse; refugees; Twitter",,,,,,,,,"Androutsopoulos, J., Online data collection (2013) Data Collection in Sociolinguistics: Methods and Applications, pp. 236-250. , Mallinson, Childs, Herk, (eds), London, Routledge,.

I adopted methods modified from the Biber Connor Upton Approach to retrieve the expanded concordances of the lexical units almarᵓa (woman) and alnisāᵓ (women) from the corpus. The extracted text reveals the discursive patterns regarding a number of topics which are discussed in Arabic newspapers, namely, socio-culture (social practices) and eco-politics. The results of the study show how and why topics related to Arab women are discursively constructed, revealing negative patterns with regard to the topics discrimination, the veil, sports, male guardianship, driving, pro-divorce settlements and municipal elections, and positive patterns concerning the topics marital status, violence, education, travel, sexual harassment, the removal of male guardianship, employment, ministerial election and political participation. The specific case of the topic (un)veil is subsequently analysed in more detail and the results reveal that the topic is associated with negative patterns within a wider socio-cultural discourse. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.","Anti-feminism; Arab women; Arabic newspapers; corpus-based discourse analysis; discourse studies; discursive patterns; eco-political practices; KACST Arabic corpus; pro-feminism; social problems",,,,,,"Deanship of Scientific Research, King Saud University: NFG-14-01-02","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: The author extends his appreciation to the Deanship of Scientific Research at King Saud University for funding this work through the Research Project No: NFG-14-01-02.",,"Al-Mujaiwel, S., Free/Open KACSTAC and its processing tools: Lexical resources for Arabic lexicogrammatical microstructures based on collocational indicators (2016) Input a Word, Analyze the World: Selected Approaches to Corpus Linguistics, pp. 153-170. , Alonso Almeida, Ortega, Quintana, (eds), Newcastle upon Tyne, Cambridge Scholars Publishing,.

This study attempts to advance our understanding of the interview by including the use of gesture, gaze, and other embodied resources in concert with speech. Looking at a focus group interview evaluating community policing policy, I show how inclusion of embodied conduct offers a more robust approach to co-constructed meaning in the interview than looking at language practices alone. More explicitly, I investigate how an interviewee’s narrative includes gestures to solicit an affiliative stance from other interviewees and how ambiguous metacommunicative norms in the focus group influence the contributions of other police participants. I show how jurisdictional boundary and professional identity emerge in and through the integration of embodied conduct and sociocultural solidarity. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.","Community policing; embodied conduct; evaluation; focus group interviews; gaze; gesture; police culture",,,,,,,,,"Atkinson, P., Silverman, D., Kundera’s immortality: The interview society and the invention of the self (1997) Qualitative Inquiry, 3 (3), pp. 304-325; Barbour, R., Kitzinger, J., (1999) Developing Focus Group Research: Politics, Research and Practice, , London, SAGE, (eds) (; Barbour, R., (2007) Doing Focus Groups, , London, SAGE; Beach, W., Language as and in technology: Facilitating topic organization in a videotext focus group meeting (1990) Communication and the Culture of Technology, pp. 197-220. , Medhurst, Gonzalez, Peterson, (eds), Pullman, WA, Washington State University Press,.

Throughout, I focus on the construal operation of framing and identify a host of discursive patterns via which minors and adolescents are recurrently placed within the semantic frame CRIME, and within this, they profile the frame elements (as per the mappings in the database FrameNet) of perpetrators of violent crimes rather than victims (e.g. of abuse and domestic violence). I argue that, in the context of the referendum, these discursive strategies run the risk of facilitating the consolidation of a strong conceptual link whereby youth become readily associated with criminality (ignoring other aspects of children’s situation in Uruguay, such as their waning access to education, child poverty, child protection laws and health issues), and are subservient to the political views of groups supporting a lower cut-off age for criminal responsibility and more stringent punishments. The observations arrived at in this instance set the foundations for a future experimental study testing whether the discursive patterns unearthed here have an effect on how readers conceptualize minors outside the texts. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.","Cognitive Critical Discourse Studies; frame semantics; FrameNet; Uruguay; youth crime",,,,,,,,,"Baker, C., Fillmore, C., Lowe, J., (1998) The Berkeley FrameNet project, vol. 1, pp. 86-90. , Proceedings of the 17th International Conference on Computational Linguistics (COLING ’98), Montreal, QC, Caa, Stroudsburg, PA, Association for Computational Linguistics,.

The findings suggest that they converge in representing China’s smog as a kind of severe air pollution that has some consequences on residents in China and poses a problem that the government must tackle. However, the Chinese English-language newspaper prefers to represent it as a kind of weather phenomenon without serious impact on public health and to construct a positive and responsible image of the Chinese central government. The Anglo-American English-language newspapers are inclined to dramatize it as a disaster with a huge health impact, and construct a negative image of the Chinese government with a view to pressurizing it to take responsibility in the context of climate change. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.","Air pollution; corpus-assisted discourse study; critical discourse analysis; environmental communication; media discourse; smog",,,,,,,,,"Alexander, R., (2010) Framing Discourse on the Environment: A Critical Discourse Approach, , London, Routledge; Baker, P., (2006) Using Corpora in Discourse Analysis, , London; New York, Continuum; Baker, P., Gabrielatos, C., KhosraviNik, M., A useful methodological synergy?

This study examines how language and communication are linked with historical narratives through the use of multimodal stories in which US political commercials link candidates’ present actions with historical events, dynamics, artifacts, and/or figures. This ‘historical coherence’ is constructed through the following strategies: (1) constructing a narrative in which popular historical figures or archetypal figures are in agreement with the candidate; (2) preempting charges of lack of historical coherence; and (3) presenting historical restrictions to freedom and casting the candidate, or the candidate’s party, in general, as a preventative from future calamities and transgressions to freedom. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.","Discourse analysis; existential coherence; historical coherence; multimodality; narrative coherence; political commercials; super PACs; transcription; video analysis",,,,,,,,,"Anderson, K., ‘Rhymes with Blunt’: Pornification and U.S. political culture (2011) Rhetoric & Public Affairs, 14 (2), pp. 327-368; (2010) Gather Your Armies: Rick Barber for Congress, , http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iQ7ZDUutU4, 13, June, accessed 20 October 2011, a),. :; (2010) Slavery: Rick Barber for Congress, , http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn14RwuJJRg, 27, June, accessed 20 October 2011, b),. :; Barthes, R., (1957) Mythologies, , New York, HarperCollins, 1972; Barty-King, H., (1988) The Drum: A Royal Tournament Tribute to the Military Drum, , London, Royal Tournament; Brown, P., Levinson, S., (1987) Politeness: Some Universals in Language Usage, , Cambridge, Cambridge University Press; Cameron, D., Ette-ymology (2015) Language: A feminist guide, , https://debuk.wordpress.com/2015/08/16/ette-ymology/, 15, August, accessed 20 August 2015,. :; Confessore, N., Lichtblau, E., ‘Campaigns’ aren’t necessarily campaigns in the age of ‘Super PACs.’ (2015) The New York Times, , http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/18/us/politics/super-pacs-are-remaking-16-campaigns-official-or-not.html?_r=0, 17, May, accessed 20 August 2015,. :; Corrigan, T., (2011) A Short Guide to Writing about Film, , New York, Longman; Daughton, S., Women’s issues, women’s place: Gendered related problems in presidential campaigns (1994) Communication Quarterly, 42 (2), pp. 106-119. , http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01463379409369920, :; Duranti, A., Narrating the political self in a campaign for US Congress (2006) Language in Society, 35 (4), pp. 467-497; Eckholm, E., Using history to mold ideas on the right (2011) The New York Times, , http://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/05/us/politics/05barton.html, 4, May,. :; Eisenstein, S., (1949) Film Form: Essays in Film Theory, , New York, Harcourt; Fairclough, N., (1998) Media Discourse, , New York, Bloomsbury; Foner, E., (2010) The Fiery Trial: Abraham Lincoln and American Slavery, , New York, W.

Drawing on the analysis of linguistic move structure and communication styles employed by researchers, this study adopts a multidimensional framework by using both discourse and quantitative analysis to compare how leaders in Global 500 corporations in China and the United States rely upon specific linguistic features to engage stakeholders in corporate discourse published on their websites. The results show pertinent differences in communication styles, where Chinese corporations tend to be more instrumental, elaborate and competitive while US corporations are more affective, succinct and harmonious. These observations depart from previous findings on interpersonal communication styles in cross-cultural research. This study also extends the boundary of corporate genre analysis by suggesting that the moves adopted in the structure of corporate messages are highly specific to the particular genre. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.","Communication styles; corporate public relations discourse; cross-cultural; global corporations; leaders’ messages; move structure analysis",,,,,,,,,"Amernic, J.H., Craig, R.J., (2006) CEO-Speak: The Language of Corporate Leadership, , Montreal, QC, Caa, McGill-Queen’s University Pres; Bakhtin, M., (1981) The Dialogical Imagination, , Austin, TX, University of Texas Press, (trans; Becker, C.B., Reasons for the lack of argumentation and debate in the Far East (1986) International Journal of Intercultural Relations, 10, pp. 75-92; Bhatia, V.K., (1993) Analysing Genre: Language Use in Professional Settings, , London, Longma; Bhatia, V.K., (2004) Words of Written Discourse: A Genre-based View, , London, Continuu; Bhatia, V.K., Towards critical genre analysis (2008) Advances in Discourse Studies, pp. 166-177. , Bhatia, Flowerdew, Jones, (eds), London and New York, Routledge,.

We propose that Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC), a software for automated text analysis widely used in social sciences, can enrich the CDA toolkit. The methodological advantage of LIWC is that its semantic categorization was developed and validated independently, which addresses the concerns about subjectivity. In two case studies we use LIWC to analyze the construction and representation of the ‘Other’ in mass media. Study 1 focuses on the representation of Russia in The New York Times (NYT) before and after its annexation of Crimea; Study 2 analyzes the change in sentiment toward Islam in NYT before and after 9/11. We find that in both cases the change in attitude is driven by an increase in negative emotion words rather than by a decrease in positive words. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.","9/11 and Islam; critical discourse analysis; mass media; positive and negative emotions; quantitative methods; representation of the ‘Other’; Russia’s annexation of Crimea; sentiment analysis",,,,,,,,,"Alazzany, M.A.O.A., Wong, B.E., Islam and Muslims in the New York Times: Two versions, two camps (2014) Pertanika Journal of Social Sciences & Humanities, 22, pp. 33-58; Back, M.D., Küfner, A.C., Egloff, B., ‘Automatic or the people?’ Anger on September 11, 2001, and lessons learned for the analysis of large digital datasets (2011) Psychological Science, 22 (6), pp. 837-838; Baker, P., (2006) Using Corpora in Discourse Analysis, , London, Continu; Baker, P., Gabrielatos, C., Khosravinik, M., A useful methodological synergy?

In this context, the metaphor of the nomad appears to be an understandable way to position the employees of organizations within non-territorial workspaces. Drawing on the empirical data of a study of organizational change in a Nordic media company, this study applied the discursive resources from the field of institutional interaction in the analysis. This article presents how the participants employed the same metaphor of the nomad as a rhetorical strategy to support and resist change, and suggests that the use of a particular discourse does not necessarily contribute to the desired outcomes. Furthermore, the study shows how constructing senses of legitimacy involves the use of the same metaphor to construct arguments and counter-arguments toward the change. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.","Discursive legitimation; organizational change; rhetorical strategies; workshop talk",,,,,,,,,"Alvesson, M., Kärreman, D., Taking the linguistic turn in organizational research: Challenges, responses, consequences (2000) Journal of Applied Behavioral Science, 36 (2), pp. 136-158. , a); Alvesson, M., Kärreman, D., Varieties of discourse: On the study of organizations through discourse analysis (2000) Human Relations, 53 (9), pp. 1125-1149. , b); Alvesson, M., Kärreman, D., Decolonializing discourse: Critical reflections on organizational discourse analysis (2011) Human Relations, 64 (9), pp. 1121-1146; Anderson, D.L., ‘What you’ll say is…’: Represented voice in organizational change discourse (2005) Journal of Organizational Change Management, 18 (1), pp. 63-77; Atkinson, P., Hammersley, M., Ethnography and participant observation (1994) Handbook of Qualitative Research, pp. 248-261. , Denzin, Lincoln, (eds), Thousand Oaks, CA, SAGE,.

This critical discourse analysis is on print and online news reporting of the case of ‘Kings Cross Nightclub Rapist Luke Lazarus’, who in March 2015 was tried and convicted of raping a female club-goer in a laneway behind his father’s nightclub in Sydney, Australia. We explore the journalism discursive practices employed in the production of the news reports about the Lazarus trial. Our analysis shows how some lexical features, quoting strategies and structuring elements serve to minimise the victim’s experience while emphasising the adverse effects of the trial on the accused. Furthermore, we demonstrate how such practices allow for the graphic representation of the attack in a salacious manner while minimising the impact of the crime on the victim by selectively referencing her victim impact statement. We found some differences between print and online news stories about this case, some of which may be attributable to the greater space available to the telling of news stories online. We conclude that in news reporting of the Lazarus case, routine journalism discursive practices, such as the inverted pyramid news-writing structure and decisions about who and what to quote, serve simultaneously to diminish the victim’s experience while objectifying her. These results build on international findings about media reporting practices in relation to violence against women and add substantially to what we know about these practices in Australia. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.","Critical discourse analysis; journalism discursive practices; news reporting; reporting practices; violence against women",,,,,,,,,"Alat, Z., News coverage of violence against women: The Turkish case (2006) Feminist Media Studies, 6 (3), pp. 295-314; Luke Lazarus jailed for raping teenager in alleyway of father Andrew’s Soho nightclub in Kings Cross (2015) ABC News, , http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-03-27/luke-lazarus-jailed-for-nightclub-rape/6353016, 27, March, a); Man who bragged to friend after rape outside Sydney club jailed for three years (2015) The Guardian, , http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/mar/27/man-with-world-at-his-feet-jailed-for-outside-sydney-club, 27, March, b); Barnett, B., Toward authenticity: Using feminist theory to construct journalistic narratives of maternal violence (2013) Feminist Media Studies, 13 (3), pp. 505-524; Bibby, P., Luke Lazarus nightclub rape conviction to be overturned (2016) The Sydney Morning Herald, , http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/luke-lazarus-nightclub-rape-conviction-to-be-overturned-20160219-gmycr9.html#ixzz41njp9LdT, 19, February; Bullock, C.F., Framing domestic violence fatalities: Coverage by Utah newspapers (2007) Women’s Studies in Communication, 30, pp. 34-63; Carlyle, K.E., Slater, M.D., Chakroff, J.L., Newspaper coverage of intimate partner violence: Skewing representations of risk (2008) Journal of Communication, 58, pp. 168-186; Carvalho, A., Media(ted) discourse and society: Rethinking the framework of critical discourse analysis (2010) Language and Journalism, pp. 10-26. , Richardson, (ed), Oxford, Routledge,.

Moreover, such processes are not necessarily linked to role hierarchy but may be emergent and distributed within teams. However, the micro-processes through which this occurs are not well understood. The significance of the article lies in its contribution to an understanding of the emergence of leadership in teams, and in particular how humour and laughter are drawn on as a resource by which to exert social influence. Here, we use the construct of the play frame, ‘non-serious’ talk in which participants jointly construct extended humorous sequences as improvisations, to analyse how team members manoeuvre in order to accomplish influence, decision-making and leadership. In taking this approach, we are not concerned with considerations of how managers use jokes to exercise control, or workers use humour to subvert management. Rather, we examine how humour, and particularly the laughter it engenders, can contribute to an understanding of organisations as centred on communication and founded on the precept that organisations are ‘talked into being’. We show how talk in a play frame institutes a context which can be utilised by participants to exert influence, and we demonstrate the highly contingent and contextual nature of the emergence of leadership within teams. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.","Communicative constitution of organisation; humorous discourse; play frame; relational leadership; strategic accomplishment",,,,,,,,,"Boden, D., (1994) The Business of Talk: Organizations in Action, , Cambridge, Polity Press; Clifton, J., Beyond taxonomies of influence: ‘Doing’ influence and making decisions in management team meetings (2009) Journal of Business Communication, 46 (1), pp. 57-79; Coates, J., Talk in a play frame: More on laughter and intimacy (2007) Journal of Pragmatics, 39 (1), pp. 29-49; Cooren, F., Kuhn, T., Cornelissen, J.P., Introduction to the special issue: Communication, organizing and organization: An overview (2011) Organization Studies, 32, pp. 1149-1170; Fayard, A., Weeks, J., Photocopiers and water-coolers: The affordances of informal interaction (2007) Organization Studies, 28 (5), pp. 605-634; Gronn, P., From distributed to hybrid leadership practice (2009) Distributed Leadership, pp. 197-217. , Harris, (ed), Dordrecht, Springer,.

Furthermore, narrators draw on shared cultural knowledge and master narratives that tend to form an implicit backdrop of their stories. Yet in this article we focus on how some of these master narratives may be mobilized explicitly when default identities are at stake. In particular, we investigate interviews with successful female professionals from diverse geographical contexts. We found that the interviewees deal with challenges to their ‘successful professional’ identities by drawing on categorical narratives or categorical statements. As such, the interviewees talk into being a morally ordered gendered worldview, thus making explicit gendered master narratives about their societies and workplaces. In general, this article shows that categorical narratives and statements can bring (the typically rather elusive) master narratives to the surface and that these can thus contribute to the narrators’ identity work. © The Author(s) 2017.","Belgium; Categorical narrative; Categorical statements; Category-bound activities; Croatia; Discourse; Discourse analysis; Gender; Generic narrative; Generic second person pronoun; Identity; India; Master narratives; Narrative analysis; Research interviews; Story type; Storytelling; Workplace; ‘Big D’ Discourse",,,,,,,,,"Andrews, M., Opening to the original contributions: Counter-narratives and the power to oppose (2004) Considering Counter-Narratives: Narrating, Resisting, Making Sense, pp. 1-6. , Bamberg M and Andrews M, Amsterdam: John Benjamins Publishing Company; Bamberg, M., Considering counter narratives (2004) Considering Counter-Narratives: Narrating, Resisting, Making Sense, pp. 351-371. , Bamberg M and Andrews M, Amsterdam: John Benjamins Publishing Company; Bamberg, M., Master narratives (2005) The Routledge Encyclopedia of Narrative Theory, pp. 287-288. , Herman D, Jahn M and Ryan M-L, New York: Routledge; Baynham, M., Performing self, narrative and community in Moroccan narratives of migration and settlement (2006) Discourse and Identity, pp. 376-397. , De Fina A, Schiffrin D and Bamberg M, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press; Brown, P., Levinson, S.C., (1987) Politeness: Some Universals in Language Usage, , Cambridge: Cambridge University Press; Buttny, R., Reported speech in talking race on campus (1997) Human Communication Research, 23 (4), pp. 477-506; Chatterjee, A., Van De Mieroop, D., Indian women at work: Struggling between visibility and invisibility (2017) Identity Struggles: Evidence from Workplaces around the World, pp. 149-166. , Van De Mieroop D and Schnurr S, Amsterdam: John Benjamins Publishing Company; Clifton, J., Van De Mieroop, D., (2016) Master Narratives, Identities, and the Stories of Former Slaves, , Amsterdam: John Benjamins Publishing Company; De Fina, A., Narratives in interview-The case of accounts: For an interactional approach to narrative genres (2009) Narrative Inquiry, 19 (2), pp. 233-258; De Fina, A., Positioning level 3: Connecting local identity displays to macro social processes (2013) Narrative Inquiry, 23 (1), pp. 40-61; De Fina, A., Georgakopoulou, A., (2012) Analyzing Narrative: Discourse and Sociolinguistic Perspectives, , Cambridge: Cambridge University Press; De Fina, A., Schiffrin, D., Bamberg, M., Introduction (2006) Discourse and Identity, pp. 1-23. , De Fina A, Schiffrin D and Bamberg M, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press; Every, D., Augoustinos, M., Constructions of racism in the Australian parliamentary debates on asylum seekers (2007) Discourse & Society, 18 (4), pp. 411-436; Gee, J.P., (1999) An Introduction to Discourse Analysis: Theory and Method, , London; New York: Routledge; Georgakopoulou, A., (2007) Small Stories, Interaction and Identities, , Amsterdam: John Benjamins Publishing Company; Georgakopoulou, A., Building iterativity into positioning analysis: A practice-based approach to small stories and self (2013) Narrative Inquiry, 23 (1), pp. 89-110; Georgakopoulou, A., Small stories research: Methods-Analysis-Outreach (2015) The Handbook of Narrative Analysis, pp. 255-271. , De Fina A and Georgakopoulou A, Chichester: Wiley-Blackwell; Hester, S., Eglin, P., Membership categorization analysis: An introduction (1997) Culture in Action: Studies in Membership Categorization Analysis, pp. 1-23. , Hester S and Eglin P, Washington, DC: University Press of America; Holstein, J.A., Gubrium, J.F., Active interviewing (2003) Holstein JA and Gubrium JF, pp. 67-80. , (eds) Postmodern Interviewing.

The results of such studies indicate that media systematically discriminate these minority groups and deem them as a security, economic and hygiene threat to the majority groups. Through the use of Lakoffand Jonson’s conceptual metaphor theory, this study compares and contrasts the representation of Syrian refugees in the online media discourse of not only host countries but also non-host countries, which, in this study, refers to nations that do not host Syrian refugees. The results show that statistical differences between the metaphors used by host and non-host countries only occur when using the metaphors that describe the entry of refugees and the burden they are inflicting on the host countries.

Focus is placed specifically on combining Talmy’s theory of Force Dynamics with methods of Critical Discourse Studies in order to investigate diverging forms of schematisation of forceful interactions among protest participants. The most frequently recurring opposing force-dynamic patterns identified are defying a hindrance, prevailing stability and causation of action as well as inaction. Notable differences may be observed between mass media and social media in regard to the representation of dynamic power relations between police and protesters. © The Author(s) 2017.","Cognitive linguistics; Critical discourse studies; Force dynamics; Media language; Political protest",,,,,,,,,"Bebawi, S., Bossio, D., (2014) Social Media and The Politics of Reportage: The ‘Arab Spring’, , Basingstoke: Palgrave Macmillan; Ben Mhenni, L., (2011) Vernetzt Euch!

The right wing Brazilian media played a crucial role in this coup by manipulating public opinion as well as the politicians who voted against Dilma. In particular, the media of the powerful Globo Corporation, such as O Globo newspaper, and especially Globo’s Jornal Nacional, the pervasive TV news program, systematically demonized and delegitimized Dilma, as well as ex-President Lula and the PT, in their news reports and editorials by selectively associating them with pervasive corruption and attributing the serious economic recession to them.

Within the intersecting fields of gender and language and workplace discourse, consultancy research-that is, practitioner-commissioned research to resolve work-related, communication problems-is still uncommon. This article presents a study of Monika, a senior leader in an engineering company, who commissioned me to find out why she was experiencing communication problems with her teams. By using interactional sociolinguistic analysis, I was able to show Monika how her authority was being resisted on gendered, linguistic grounds. In making the case for more consultancy research, I discuss how we might use insights from discourse analysis to offer guidance to practitioners seeking our help. © The Author(s) 2017.","Communication; Consultancy research; Gender and language; Leadership; Practitioner; Problem-solving; Workplace discourse",,,,,,,,,"Angouri, J., Managing disagreement in problem solving meeting talk (2012) Journal of Pragmatics, 44 (12), pp. 1565-1579; Angouri, J., Marra, M., (2011) Constructing Identities at Work, , Basingstoke: Palgrave Macmillan; Bargiela-Chiappini, F., Nickerson, C., Planken, B., (2007) Business Discourse, , Basingstoke: Palgrave Macmillan; Baxter, J., (2010) The Language of Female Leadership, , Basingstoke: Palgrave Macmillan; Baxter, J., (2014) Double-Voicing at Work: Power, Gender and Linguistic Expertise, , Basingstoke: Palgrave Macmillan; Brown, P., Levinson, S., (1987) Politeness: Some Universals in Language Usage, , Cambridge: Cambridge University Press; Burns, A., (2010) Doing Action Research in English Language Teaching: A Guide for Practitioners, , New York: Routledge; Cameron, D., Language, gender and sexuality: Current issues and new directions (2005) Applied Linguistics, 26 (4), pp. 482-502; Cameron, D., Theorising the female voice in public contexts (2006) Speaking Out: The Female Voice in Public Contexts, pp. 3-20. , Baxter J (ed.), Basingstoke: Palgrave Macmillan; Cook, G., (2003) Applied Linguistics, , Oxford: Oxford University Press; Denzin, N.K., Lincoln, Y.S., (2000) The Handbook of Qualitative Research, , London: SAGE; Grant, T., TXT 4N6: Idiolect free authorship analysis?

This article aims to characterize some dominant stylistic patterns in magazine articles devoted to environmental issues by identifying the devices used to enhance newsworthiness, given the fact that for some readers environmental topics may no longer seem engaging. The analytic perspective is an adaptation of the newsworthiness framework that has been applied in news discourse studies. The material is a sample of the 38 most-read environment-oriented articles in the online version of the international science magazine New Scientist collected between late 2013 and late 2014. The articles are analysed qualitatively to show the instantiations of such newsworthiness criteria as novelty and superlativeness, timeliness and impact, negativity and positivity as well as other strategies aimed at engaging the readers: rationalization and speculation, direct address and conversational style. The analysis reveals how, in this case study, science communication is turned into infotainment and considers the implications of this discursive shift for the public understanding of environmental science. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.","Discourse analysis; environmental coverage; infotainment; New Scientist; news values; newsworthiness; popular journalism; public understanding of science; science journalism; stylistic analysis",,,,,,,,,"Badenschier, F., Wormer, H., Issue selection in science journalism: Towards a special theory of news values for science news?

First, it aims to identify the moves present in the review response genre; second, it aims to explore how the hotel management attempts to achieve service recovery with the moves of the genre.

The significance of media stance towards the miners remains a controversial issue today, as attested by recent publications looking back at the strike (Williams, 2009a, 2014). Here, authors including miners, journalists and other commentators argue that media coverage of the strike followed a consistently anti-trade union agenda in which the media sought to destabilise the strike. An internal British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) report, only recently made public, shows that the BBC themselves had concerns over possible imbalances in their coverage of the so-called ‘Battle of Orgreave’ (Harcup, 2014). Despite the weight attached to media coverage in this context, however, surprisingly little research has been conducted from a discourse-analytical perspective to show systematically and empirically how such an agenda may have been manifested across media texts. In this article, drawing on Cognitive Linguistic Critical Discourse Studies (CL-CDS), I show how one particular metaphorical framing of the strike, which construed the strike as a war between the State and the National Union of Miners, persisted through the year-long period and consider the potential ideological functions of this framing in media strategies of (de)legitimation. I show how this metaphor featured in linguistic, visual and multimodal forms of media representation. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.","British Miners’ Strike; framing; multimodal metaphor; news photographs",,,,,,,,,"Barthes, R., (1972) Mythologies, , New York, Nooay Press; Barthes, R., (1977) Image Music Text, , London, Fontana Press; Bednarek, M., Caple, H., (2012) News Discourse, , London, Continuum; Bounegru, L., Forceville, C., Metaphors in editorial cartoons representing the global financial crisis (2011) Visual Communication, 10 (2), pp. 209-229; Cameron, L., Patterns of metaphor use in reconciliation talk (2007) Discourse & Society, 18 (2), pp. 197-222; Cappella, J.N., Jamieson, K.H., (1997) Spiral of Cynicism: The Press and the Public Good, , New York, Oxford University Press; Charteris-Black, J., (2004) Corpus Approaches to Critical Metaphor Analysis, , Basingstoke, Palgrave Macmillan; Chilton, P., (1996) Security Metaphors: Cold War Discourse from Containment to Common House, , New York, Peter Lang; Chouliaraki, L., The aestheticization of suffering on television (2006) Visual Communication, 5 (3), pp. 261-285; De Vreese, C.H., News framing: Theory and typology (2005) Information Design Journal + Document Design, 13 (1), pp. 51-62; Demmen, J., Semino, E., Demjén, Z., A computer-assisted study of the use of violence metaphors for cancer and end of life by patients, family carers and health professionals (2015) International Journal of Corpus Linguistics, 20 (2), pp. 205-231; Dirven, R., Frank, R., Pütz, M., (2003) Cognitive Models in Language and Thought: Ideology, Metaphors and Meanings, , Berlin, Moutoe Gruyter, (eds) (; Dirven, R., Polzenhagen, F., Wolf, H.-G., Cognitive linguistics, ideology and critical discourse analysis (2007) The Oxford Handbook of Cognitive Linguistics, pp. 1222-1240. , Geeraerts, Cuckyens, (eds), Oxford, Oxford University Press,.

Civil organisations have been instrumental in the secessionist movement and have used social media to mobilise the Catalan public and raise national consciousness. Drawing on theories of national identity, gender and nation, and the discursive construction of national identity, this article examines constructions of national identity and the gendered dimensions of these constructions in a Twitter corpus collected in the week up to the public consultation on independence held in Catalonia in November 2014. Analysis of the contrasting representations of men and women found in the data suggests that, among both the elites and the public, the contemporary Catalan nationalist project continues to be built on traditional gender normative models of nationalism. The study concludes that this type of nationalism has now become so banal that it has been naturalised and suggests that a more inclusive approach may be needed in future campaigns or in the Catalan nationalist project as a whole. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.","Catalonia; discourse analysis; gender; independence; national identity; nationalism; Twitter",,,,,,,,,"Anderson, B., (1986) Imagined Communities: Reflections on the Origin and Spread of Nationalism, , London, Verso; Anduiza, E., Cristancho, C., Sabucedo, J.M., Mobilization through online social networks: The political protest of the Indignados in Spain (2014) Information, Communication & Society, 17 (6), pp. 750-764; Anthony, L., (2015) AntConc (Version 3.4.4): Computer Software, , http://www.laurenceanthony.net/, Tokyo, Japan, Waseda University, accessed 19 May 2015,. :; Anyefru, E., Cyber-nationalism: The imagined Anglophone Cameroon community in cyberspace (2008) African Identities, 6 (3), pp. 253-274; Arvidsson, V., Foka, A., Digital gender: Perspective, phenomena, practice (2015) First Monday, 20 (4). , http://www.ojphi.org/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/5930/4430, accessed 7 June 2015; Bailey, J., Steeves, V., Burkell, J., Negotiating with gender stereotypes on social networking sites: From ‘bicycle face’ to Facebook (2013) Journal of Communication Inquiry, 37 (2), pp. 91-112; Baker, P., (2006) Using Corpora in Discourse Analysis, , London, Continuum; Bamman, D., Eisenstein, J., Schnoebelen, T., Gender identity and lexical variation in social media (2014) Journal of Sociolinguistics, 18 (2), pp. 135-160; Bekkers, V., Moody, R., Edwards, A., Micro-mobilization, social media and coping strategies: Some Dutch experiences (2011) Policy & Internet, 3 (4), pp. 1-29; Bell, D.S., Mythscapes: Memory, mythology, and national identity (2003) British Journal of Sociology, 54 (1), pp. 63-81; Bergès, K., La nacionalización del cuerpo femenino al servicio de la construcción de la identidad nacional en las culturas políticas falangistas y franquistas [Nationalisation of the female body in the service of constructing a national identity in Falangist and Francoist cultures] (2012) Mélanges de la Casa de Velázquez, 42 (2), pp. 91-103; Billig, M., (1995) Banal Nationalism, , London, SAGE; boyd, D., Crawford, K., Critical questions for big data: Provocations for a cultural, technological, and scholarly phenomenon (2012) Information, Communication & Society, 15 (5), pp. 662-679; Bryman, A., (2012) Social Research Methods, , 4th edn., Oxford, Oxford University Press; Castells, M., (2010) The Power of Identity: The Information Age: Economy, Society, and Culture, , 2nd edn., Malden, MA, Wiley-Blackwell; Conversi, D., (2000) The Basques, the Catalans, and Spain: Alternative Routes to Nationalist Mobilisation, , London, Hurst; Crameri, K., Banal Catalanism?

This article uses positioning analysis to discuss challenges that use of humour poses for the identity of public organizations. Drawing on interviews with communications professionals working in the emergency services sector, the article suggests six evaluative themes that factor into organizational identity construction, such as the frequency and type of humour in social media posts. Indeed, while humour helps fashion more flexible and risk-taking organizational identities, it can also stand contrary to a bureaucratic ethos of public servantship and equal treatment. Dilemmas thus arise for public authorities that seek to adjust to the times and still remain ‘in character’. The article contributes to organizational identity research by considering the hitherto overlooked immersion of social media use, humour and organizational identity formation. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.","Communication professionals; discourse; humour; organizational identity; positioning analysis; public authorities; social media",,,,,,,,,"Albert, S., Whetten, D.A., Organizational identity (1985) Research in Organizational Behavior, pp. 263-295. , Cummings, Staw, (eds), Greenwich, CT, JAI Press,.

Yet few studies have investigated the schematic structure and persuasive style of editorials. Hence, this study aims to compare the generic characteristics in 240 editorials of The New York Times (NYT, n = 120) and New Straits Times (NST, n = 120). To realize the objectives, the corpus was subjected to a content analysis based on a composite framework drawn from the data and previous models. The findings revealed that American and Malaysian editorials share a similar schematic structure at the move level including four obligatory moves. However, at the step level, evidence of disparity of the style of writing was apparent. The data obtained could be used as informed input in the English for Specific Purposes (ESP) classroom, so that English as a Secondary Language (ESL)/English as a Foreign Language (EFL) students’ awareness on the conventional structures in editorial writing could be heightened. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.","Contrastive analysis; genre analysis; newspaper editorial; schematic structure",,,,,,"Ministry of Higher Education, Malaysia, MOHE: KPT.B.600-18/3 JILID 4","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was supported by the Ministry of Higher Education Malaysia (grant no: KPT.B.600-18/3 JILID 4).",,"Ansary, H., Babaii, E., The generic integrity of newspaper editorials: A systemic functional perspective (2005) RELC Journal, 36 (3), pp. 271-295; Ansary, H., Babaii, E., A cross-cultural analysis of English newspaper editorials: A systemic-functional view of text for contrastive rhetoric research (2009) RELC Journal, 40 (2), pp. 211-249; Bell, A., (1991) The Language of News Media, , Oxford; Cambridge, MA, Blackwell Publishers; Bhatia, V.K., (1993) Analyzing Genre: Language Use in Professional Settings, , London and New York, Longman; Bhatia, V.K., Integrating products, processes, purposes and participants in professional writing (1999) Writing: Texts, Processes and Practices, pp. 21-39. , Candlin, Hyland, (eds), London, Longman Group,.

The texts are analyzed on the theoretical basis of critical discourse analysis (CDA) and considering the following analytical categories: metaphor, representation of social actors and intertextuality.

The two central questions of this article are as follows: first, ‘how much religious difference and of what kind is compatible within Europe?’ and second, ‘to what extent can Muslim diversity be integrated into Europe?’. This article undertakes an investigation of these questions and explores the extent to which discourses on religious diversity imply boundary making and aim at limiting the religious freedom of Muslims. Empirically, I scrutinize press coverage between 2009 and 2010, the years in which the minarets ban entered the sociopolitical arena of European public debate. The methodology adopts a social network analysis to uncover semantic macro-structures and elicit common discourses in the press of France, Germany, Italy and the United Kingdom. Subsequently, discourse analysis of relevant samples is applied to examine textual strategies used to legitimate inclusion or exclusion of religious difference. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.","Critical discourse analysis; discourse; diversity; Europe; France; Germany; integration; Islam; Italy; media; method-mix; Muslim; network analysis; press; public debate; religion; semantics; United Kingdom",,,,,,,,,"Allievi, S., How the immigrant has become Muslim (2008) Revue Européenne des Migrations Internationales, 21, pp. 135-163; Baker, P., Representations of Islam in British broadsheet and tabloid newspapers 1999–2005 (2010) Journal of Language and Politics, 9 (2), pp. 310-338; Baker, P., Acceptable bias?

On the one hand, analyses predominantly grasp the debate in terms of pro-and-con dialectics, as if the pro-shale gas camp faced the anti-shale gas camp in a dyadic clash of opposing voices. On the other hand, it is commonly recognised that this debate is driven by multi-party and multi-position argumentative dynamics. In this broader context, I focus on one pivotal contribution to the debate – Gazprom’s press release from October 2013 outlining Russia’s energy giant’s strategy of dealing with unconventional gas production. I employ concepts and methods of argumentative discourse analysis to contend that an arguer to a multi-party debate – argumentative polylogue – faces a number of constraints and opportunities that cannot be adequately grasped in terms of dyadic pro-and-con dialectics. The analysis reveals how Gazprom needs to simultaneously design its discourse to address a number of other parties who might also disagree among themselves: from Greenpeace to European Union governments to shale gas companies. I show why and how a stakeholder analysis used in organisational communication might lead to a better understanding of this form of multi-party public argumentation. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.","Argumentation; climate change; dialectics; energy policy; fracking; Gazprom; hydraulic fracturing; polylogue; shale gas; stakeholder analysis",,,,,,"Universidade Nova de Lisboa, UNL","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: The author received financial support from an exploratory grant for international projects, awarded by the Faculty of Social Sciences and Humanities (FCSH), Universidade Nova de Lisboa, entitled Practical argumentation in the European energy and climate debates: Values, argumentative strategies, and discursive representations across Europe.",,"Aakhus, M., Lewiński, M., Advancing polylogical analysis of large-scale argumentation: Disagreement management in the fracking controversy (2016) Argumentation, , 1, June,.

The analysis details the grammatical and semantic clusters within the controversial environmental debate and how these clusters reflect the values and beliefs of each group as well as their conceptualization of the mountains and the environment. The integration of the ecolinguistic framework with corpus linguistic methods of keyword analysis as well as part of speech (POS) and semantic tag analysis facilitated the identification of clusters of linguistic features perpetuating a dominant and ultimately destructive cultural discourse that places humans in a role of dominion and authority over the environment in the company texts. In contrast, clusters within the oppositional discourse forwarded by the environmental group promote the aesthetic value of the land and a need for responsible environmental stewardship. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.","Corpus-aided discourse analysis; ecolinguistics; ecological discourse analysis; environmental communication; environmental discourse",,,,,,,,,"Alexander, R., Everyone is talking about ‘sustainable development’.

Print headlines are mostly contiguous with the story to which they refer. Broadcast headlines, however, are often at some temporal distance from their associated news item. In the print medium every story carries a headline. In broadcast news only some items are headlined. And yet, whereas the linguistic properties of print headlines have been much studied, almost no attention has been given to broadcast headlines. This article uses a corpus of headlines from BBC television news to explore their discursive form and function. It isolates a basic structure of {heading (+supplement)} for television news headlines and delineates a repertoire of patterns through which the structure is realised. In doing so, it suggests that the core function of television news headlines is to engage with the audience by projecting aspects of their news values forward through the programme. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.","Direct address; heading; sequential organisation; summary; supplement; systemic functional grammar; television news headline; trailer; transitivity",,,,,,,,,"Atkinson, J.M., Drew, P., (1979) Order in Court: The Organisation of Verbal Interaction in Judicial Settings, , London, Macmillan; Bateson, G., A theory of play and fantasy (1955) Steps to an Ecology of Mind: Collected Essays in Anthropology, Psychiatry, Evolution, and Epistemology, pp. 138-148. , Bateson, (ed), London, Jason Aronson,.

During these discussions, various conceptions of publicness and public space have been articulated. Indeed, one may view the killings as a ‘critical discourse moment’ in which a range of discourses have been employed to help interpret, understand, and deal with what happened. In several of these discourses, conceptions of publicness play a central part. This article sets out to investigate the conceptions of publicness that were articulated in the Danish public spheres following the attacks. The article maps out some of the key different and partly contradictory notions of publicness that the reactions to the killings brought to the fore. The investigation thus focuses on the articulation of normative expectations and ideals of public spheres, on the limitations and restrictions that were acknowledged, and on the main societal problems and (inter)national contexts to which publicness was viewed as related. The analysis will cover national newspapers and center on the discursive resources of the media elite in early responses to the attacks, for example in editorials, or comments by writers, academics, debaters, and intellectuals. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.","dialogism; Discourse analysis; little ‘d’ versus big ‘D’ discourse; public space; terrorism",,,,,,,,,"Alvesson, M., Kärreman, D., Decolonializing discourse: Critical reflections on organizational discourse analysis (2011) Human Relations, 64 (9), pp. 1121-1146; (2007) Retorik, , Odense, Museum Tusculanum; Bakhtin, M.M., (1986) Speech Genres and Other Late Essays, , Austin, TX, University of Texas Press; Billig, M., (1996) Arguing and Thinking: A Rhetorical Approach to Social Psychology, , 2nd edn., Cambridge, Cambridge University Press; Bitzer, L., The rhetorical situation (1968) Philosophy & Rhetoric, 1 (1), pp. 1-14; Boukala, S., Waiting for democracy: Political crisis and the discursive (re)invention of the ‘national enemy’ in times of ‘Grecovery’ (2014) Discourse & Society, 25 (4), pp. 483-499; Carvalho, A., Representing the politics of the greenhouse effect: Discursive strategies in the British media (2005) Critical Discourse Studies, 2 (1), pp. 1-29; Charteris-Black, J., (2013) Analysing Political Speeches – Rhetoric, Discourse and Metaphor, , Basingstoke, Palgrave Macmillan; Chilton, P., Metaphor, euphemism and the militarization of language (1987) Current Research on Peace and Violence, 10, pp. 7-19; Chilton, P., (2004) Analysing Political Discourse: Theory and Practice, , London, Routledge; Chouliaraki, L., Watching The politics of pity (2004) Discourse & Society, 15 (2-3), pp. 185-198. , 11, September; Fahnestock, J., (2011) Rhetorical Style: The Uses of Language in Persuasion, , Oxford, Oxford University Press; Fairclough, N., (2003) Analysing Discourse: Textual Analysis for Social Research, , London, Routledge; Fairclough, N., Discourse analysis in organization studies: The case for critical realism (2005) Organization Studies, 26 (6), pp. 915-939; Fairclough, N., (2010) Critical Discourse Analysis, , 2nd edn., London, Longman; Foucault, M., (1969) L’archéologie du savoir, , Paris, Gallimard, [The Archeology of Knowledge]; Foucault, M., (1971) L’ordre du discours, , Paris, Gallimard, [The Order of Discourse]; Fraser, N., Rethinking the public sphere: A contribution to the critique of actually existing democracy (1992) Habermas and the Public Sphere, pp. 109-142. , Calhoun, (ed), Cambridge, MA, MIT Press,.

Here, we focus on argumentation in a television ‘civic debate’ about abolishing compulsory military service. To provide a unified and integrated overview of the debate dynamics, we combine the Dialogical Model of Argumentation and the Argumentum Model of Topics, which share a similar emphasis on the discursive dimension of argumentation.

It tracks the mediated trajectory of an attempt by a group of academics to connect with audiences beyond academia, comparing a magazine article in which their opinions first became public, to its recontextualisation across various UK newspapers and their Internet spin-offs. A mediated stylistic analysis reveals the discursive, rhetorical and performative techniques via which a sociologically imaginative attempt to transform a seemingly-personal-trouble into a definitively-public-issue got recontextualised as if merely the public projection of personal angst. The article concludes by noting that in an era where public engagement increasingly means mediated public engagement, to take seriously the interactive, intertextual and rhetorical affordances of media discourse is to understand that and how sociologically imaginative work can – but does not always – end up circulating within public debate. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.","Higher education; media discourse; mediated stylistics; public engagement; recontextualisation",,,,,,,,,"Attenborough, F., ‘I don’t f***ing care!’ Marginalia and the (textual) negotiation of an academic identity by university students (2011) Discourse & Communication, 5 (2), pp. 99-121; Attenborough, F., Jokes, pranks, blondes and banter: Recontextualising sexism in the British print press (2014) Journal of Gender Studies, 23 (2), pp. 137-154; Attenborough, F., Rape is rape (except when it’s not): The media, recontextualisation and violence against women (2015) Journal of Language Aggression and Conflict, 2 (2), pp. 183-203; Austin, J.L., (1975) How to Do Things with Words, , Cambridge, MA, Harvard University Press; Bal, M., (2009) Narratology, , 3rd edn, London, University of Toronto Press; Billig, M., (1995) Banal Nationalism, , London, SAGE; Blommaert, J., (2005) Discourse, , Cambridge, Cambridge University Press; Bloom, A., What Miss really means (2014) Times Educational Supplement, , https://www.tes.co.uk/article.aspx?storyCode=6427726, 9, May, accessed 3 August 2016,. :; Boynton, P., Getting the press we deserve: Opportunities and challenges for innovative media practice (2012) Feminism & Psychology, 22 (4), pp. 536-540; Buckingham, D., Representing audiences: Audience research, public knowledge and policy (2013) The Communication Review, 16 (1-2), pp. 51-60; Cline-Cohen, P., (1982) A Calculating People: The Spread of Numeracy in Early America, , Chicago, IL, Chicago University Press; Collini, S., (2012) What Are Universities for?, , London, Penguin Group; (2015) Call teachers names if you must, just not their first ones, p. 22. , 15, May, p; Dunleavy, P., (2012) From research to policy: Academic impacts on government, , http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/impactofsocialsciences/2012/03/12/from-research-to-policy-academic-impacts-on-goverment/, accessed 3 August 2016,. :; Durkheim, E., (1938) The Rules of Sociological Method, , Glencoe, IL, The Free Press; (2016) Funding opportunities, , http://www.esrc.ac.uk/funding/funding-opportunities/, :; Edwards, D., Moaning, whinging and laughing: The subjective side of complaints (2005) Discourse Studies, 7 (1), pp. 5-29; Eglin, P., Hester, S., (2003) The Montreal Massacre, , Waterloo, ON, Wilfrid Laurier University Press; Ehrlich, S., Post-penetrative rape and the decontextualization of witness testimony (2013) Coercion and Consent in the Legal Process: Linguistic and Discursive Perspectives, pp. 189-205. , Ehrlich, Eades, Ainsworth, (eds), New York, Oxford University Press,.

This article proposes a new approach to analyzing such meetings that integrates conversation analysis (CA) and issue framing (IF). While CA and IF have both been applied to collaborative decision-making, each approach, on its own, suffers from significant limitations. Combined, they allow negotiation talk in meetings to be examined holistically, integrating a consideration of both process and content. New relationships among interactional sequences and framing processes are revealed, leading to the discovery of patterns across the decision-making activity as a whole. These patterns, in turn, can be situated in the context of the institutions within which the negotiations take place. This novel integrative approach is illuminated through application to a 162-turn decision-making activity. © The Author(s) 2016.","Collaboration; conversation analysis; decision-making; ethnography; integration of methods; issue framing; meetings; negotiation; participation",,,,,,,,,"Asmuss, B., Oshima, S., Negotiation of entitlement in proposal sequences (2012) Discourse Studies, 14, pp. 67-86; Barnes, R., Formulations and the facilitation of common agreement in meetings talk (2007) Text & Talk, 27, pp. 273-296; Bateson, G., A theory of play and phantasy (1955) Psychiatric Research Reports, 2, pp. 39-51; Bateson, G., (1972) Steps to an Ecology of Mind: Collected Essays in Anthropology, Psychiatry, Evolution, and Epistemology, , San Francisco, CA: Chandler Publishing Co; Beyerlein, M., Johnson, D., (1994) Theories of Self-managing Work Teams, , Greenwich, CT: JAI Press; Boden, D., (1994) The Business of Talk: Organizations in Action, , Cambridge: Polity Press; Bolden, G.B., Robinson, J.D., Soliciting accounts with why-interrogatives in conversation (2011) Journal of Communication, 61, pp. 94-119; Brenneis, D., Performing passions: Aesthetics and politics in an occasionally egalitarian community (1987) American Ethnologist, 14 (2), pp. 236-250; Brugnach, M., Dewulf, A., Henriksen, H.J., More is not always better: Coping with ambiguity in natural resources management (2011) Journal of Environmental Management, 92, pp. 78-84; Choi, S., Schnurr, S., Exploring distributed leadership: Solving disagreements and negotiating consensus in a ‘leaderless’ team (2014) Discourse Studies, 16, pp. 3-24; Cooke, B., Kothari, U., (2001) Participation: The New Tyranny?, , New York: Zed Books; Dalton, M., (1959) Men Who Manage, , New York: John Wiley & Sons; Davidson, J., Subsequent versions of invitations, offers, requests, and proposals dealing with potential or actual rejection (1984) Structures of Social Action: Studies in Conversation Analysis, pp. 102-128. , Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.

I posit that the female viewers connect subconsciously with the image of the proactive female protagonists through the psychological mechanism in which we identify with ‘our like’ on the screen. This, in turn, allows for the projection of ‘common ground’, a positive politeness strategy, to favourably dispose the female audience towards the protagonists and, by extension, the products advertised. The success of these ads depends on women viewers identifying with the apparently dominant female protagonists – a case of ‘gender stereotype reversal’. However, I put forward that through the violent modification of their partners’ behaviour, the women become responsible for them, and so the ads convey the common gender stereotype of women as carers. © The Author(s) 2016.","Commercials; critical discourse analysis; gender; politeness; Spain; stereotypes; television",,,,,,,,,"Alreck, P.L., Commentary: A new formula for gendering products and brands (1994) The Journal of Product and Brand Management, 3 (1), pp. 6-18; Ambady, N., Koo, J., Lee, F., More than words: Linguistic and nonlinguistic politeness in two cultures (1996) Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 70 (5), pp. 996-1011; Bartsch, R., Burnett, T., Diller, T., Gender representation in television commercials: Updating an update (2000) Sex Roles, 43, pp. 735-743; Beetles, A., Harris, L.C., Consumer attitudes towards female nudity in advertising: An empirical study (2005) Marketing Theory, 5, pp. 397-432; Bell, P., Milic, M., Goffman’s Gender Advertisements revisited: Combining content analysis with semiotic analysis (2002) Visual Communication, 1 (2), pp. 203-222; Bourdieu, P., (1990) The Logic of Practice, , Palo Alto, CA: Stanford University Press; Bresnahan, M.J., Inoue, Y., Liu, W.Y., Changing gender roles in prime-time commercials in Malaysia, Japan, Taiwan, and the United States (2001) Sex Roles, 45 (1-2), pp. 117-131; Brown, P., Levinson, S.C., (1987) Politeness: Some Universals in Language Usage, , Cambridge: Cambridge University Press; Butler, J., (1990) Gender Trouble: Feminism and the Subversion of Identity, , London; New York: Routledge; Cohen-Eliya, M., Hammer, Y., Advertisements, stereotypes, and freedom of expression (2004) Journal of Social Philosophy, 35 (2), pp. 165-187; Coltrane, S., Messineo, M., The perpetuation of subtle prejudice: Race and gender imagery in 1990s television advertising (2000) Sex Roles, 42 (5-6), pp. 363-389; Conway, M., Vartanian, L.R., A status account of gender stereotypes: Beyond communality and agency (2000) Sex Roles, 43 (3-4), pp. 181-199; Corner, J., Ad worlds (2004) The Television Studies Reader, pp. 226-241. , London: Routledge.

The role of language in synchronous computer-mediated discourse (CMD) used in virtual teamwork is now emerging as a key area of research concern in business management and information technology disciplines. This article uses linguistic frameworks, most particularly critical discourse analysis (CDA) and systemic functional linguistics (SFL), in particular appraisal analysis, to demonstrate how interpersonal meanings may create dominance, power and solidarity within a sample of a virtual team management meetings. Focusing on one manager case study, we investigate how language is used, consciously or unconsciously, to dominate and close down discussion with his colleagues. We first present the key findings from a turn-taking analysis and then present, through the application of appraisal analysis, how this manager opens or contracts the space available for others to participate. By revealing how power and control unfold through this analysis, the findings may lead to an enhanced self-awareness among all members in virtual teams and reveal how language plays a crucial role in engaging members during a meeting, or in this case, disengaging them. © The Author(s) 2016.","Appraisal analysis; power and dominance; systemic functional linguistics; virtual team management",,,,,,,,,"Bargiela-Chiappini, F., Nickerson, C., Planken, B., (2013) Business Discourse, , Basingstoke: Palgrave Macmillan; Barner-Rasmussen, W., Ehrnrooth, M., Koveshnikov, A., Cultural and language skills as resources for boundary spanning within the MNC (2014) Journal of International Business Studies, 45, pp. 886-905; Blommaert, J., Bulcaen, C., Critical discourse analysis (2000) Annual Review of Anthropology, 29, pp. 447-466; Cameron, D., (2000) Good to Talk?

Drawing upon the previous analyses on relations of trust and discourse, and on the crucial aspects of trustworthiness, it examines how the officials struggled for trustworthiness discursively, and how their ‘doing’ trustworthiness varied in two phases of crisis communication. The analysis reveals markedly different approaches to the officials’ ‘doing’ trustworthiness in two phases. In the ‘unsatisfactory’ phase, the officials mainly constructed the aspect of expertise, with few expressions conveying integrity and none conveying care; while in the ‘well-handled’ phase, the officials constructed all three aspects. In addition, their discursive strategies of constructing expertise changed from extensively using ‘techs’ to combining ‘techs’ and vernacular language, and those of constructing integrity changed from not saying ‘what lacks evidence’ to providing information with adequate evidence. Effects of different aspects and discursive strategies on trust are also discussed. © The Author(s) 2016.","Benevolence; care; China; crisis communication; discursive strategies; expertise; identity construction; integrity; press conferences; Tianjin blasts; trust",,,,,,,,,"Aikhenvald, A.Y., (2004) Evidentiality, , Oxford: Oxford University Press; Antaki, C., Widdicombe, S., (1998) Identities in Talk, , London: SAGE; (1954) The Rhetoric and the Poetics, , London: Random House, (trans.); Arnot, D.C., Trust: Current thinking and future research (2007) European Journal of Marketing, 41 (9), pp. 981-987; Becker, H.S., (1971) Sociological Work: Method and Substance, , London: Allen Lane; Boin, A., Hart, P., Stern, E., Sundelius, B., (2005) The Politics of Crisis Management: Public Leadership under Pressure, , Cambridge: Cambridge University Press; Burke, K., (1969) A Rhetoric of Motives, , Berkeley, CA: University of California Press; Buttny, R., Wal-Mart’s presentation to the community: Discursive practices in mitigating risk, limiting public discussion, and developing a relationship (2009) Discourse & Communication, 3 (3), pp. 235-254; Candlin, C.N., Crichton, J., (2012) Discourses of Trust, , Basingstoke: Palgrave Macmillan; Fetzer, A., Weizman, E., Berlin, L.N., (2015) The Dynamics of Political Discourse: Forms and Functions of Follow-ups, , Amsterdam; Philadelphia, PA: John Benjamins Publishing Company; Fischer, F., (2000) Citizens, Experts and the Environment, , Durham, NC: Duke University Press; Fuoli, M., Assessing social responsibility: A qualitative analysis of appraisal in BP’s and IKEA’s social reports (2012) Discourse & Communication, 6 (1), pp. 55-81; Fuoli, M., Paradis, C., A model of trust-repair discourse (2014) Journal of Pragmatics, 74, pp. 52-69; Garfinkel, H., A conception of, and experiments with, ‘trust’ as a condition of stable concerted actions (1963) Motivation and Social Interaction: Cognitive Approaches, pp. 187-238. , New York: Ronald Press.

The few linguistics-related studies that have examined the media reportage of the BH activities, with emphasis on the discourse and linguistic strategies deployed in the representations, have not been sufficient. This study, therefore, identifies the linguistic and discourse strategies deployed by selected newspapers in representing the BH and other social actors. For data, headline and overline stories are purposively sampled from four newspapers, published from 2011 to 2014, from the northern (Daily Trust and Leadership Nigeria) and southern (The Punch and The Nation) parts of Nigeria. The analysis is guided by a combination of critical discourse analysis and systemic functional linguistics. In all the reports subjected to analysis, 13 representational strategies were identified, while at least 15 tools from Van Leeuwen’s categorisations were used in representing social actors. The newspapers also deployed discourse strategies to manage the voices of social actors, identify and specify the social actors and action, label, condemn BH activities, among others. The mediated reports on BH insurgency orientate Nigerians. © The Author(s) 2016.","Boko Haram; discourse strategies; linguistic strategies; media representation; Nigerian newspapers; terrorism",,,,,,"Carnegie Corporation of New York, CCNY","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: The manuscript for this publication was prepared with the support of the African Humanities Fellowship Program established by the American Council of Learned Societies with a generous grant from the Carnegie Corporation of New York.",,"Adesoji, A.O., The Boko Haram uprising and Islamic revivalism in Nigeria (2010) African Spectrum, 45 (2), pp. 95-108; Adesoji, A.O., Between maitatsine and Boko Haram (2011) Africa Today, 57 (4), pp. 99-118. , http://dx.doi.org/10.2979/africatoday.57.4.99, accessed 25 June 2014; Agbiboa, D.E., No retreat, no surrender: Understanding the religious terrorism of Boko Haram in Nigeria (2013) African Study Monographs, 34 (2), pp. 65-84; Agbiboa, D.E., Boko-Haram and the global Jihad: ‘Do not think Jihad is over.

Based on the analysis of a comparable corpus of Chinese and Australian hard news reporting on risk events, the study investigates the cultural variability of engagement patterns and indicates how text patterns point to distinctions in the ways the power relations are reproduced in news production processes. Corpus findings show that Chinese and Australian journalists mediate news sources of different statuses in different ways. Chinese journalists tend to close down the dialogic space of elite sources but to open up that of ordinary citizens’ sources. Australian journalists tend to contract the dialogic space of elite sources as much as they expand it. It is argued that such different patterns of engaging with news sources are related to the power relations between journalists and news sources in each context. © The Author(s) 2015.","Chinese and Australian hard news; corpus-based studies; engagement patterns; epistemic discourse analysis; power relations",,,,,,,,,"Bagnall, N., (1993) Newspaper Language, , Oxford: Focal Press; Bednarek, M., Epistemological positioning and evidentiality in English news discourse: A text-driven approach (2006) Text & Talk, 26 (6), pp. 635-660; Bednarek, M., (2006) Evaluation in Media Discourse: Analysis of a Newspaper Corpus, , London; New York: Continuum; Bell, A., (1991) The Language of News Media, , Oxford; Cambridge, MA: Blackwell; Biber, D., Johansson, S., Leech, G., (1999) Longman Grammar of Spoken and Written English, , London: Longman; Bourdieu, P., Social space and symbolic power (1989) Sociological Theory, 7 (1), pp. 14-25; Bourdieu, P., (1991) Language and Symbolic Power, , Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press; Caldas-Coulthard, C.R., On reporting: The representation of speech in factual and factional narratives (1994) Advances in Written Text Analysis, pp. 295-308. , London; New York: Routledge,,.

Five main frames emerged: social change, personal frame, risks of late parenting, older continued parenting and reproductive technology–enabled parenting. The relationship of these framings to the discursive construction of ageing and late parenting reveals varying positionings of older parents, which tend to reinforce, but also at times challenge, conventional expectations of ‘age-appropriate’ timing of reproduction, especially regarding women. Media framing analysis, critical discourse analysis and a social constructionist orientation to age(ing) and lifespan identity are drawn on in the analysis. The study also highlights how framing, as a concept from communication theory, together with different perspectives on ageing and different dimensions of age, can complement discourse analysis of news texts. © The Author(s) 2015.","Age; critical discourse analysis; fatherhood; lifespan identity; media framing analysis; motherhood; news discourse; parenting; representation; United Kingdom",,,,,,,,,"Angouri, J., ‘The older I get the less I trust people’: Constructing age identities in the workplace (2012) Pragmatics, 22 (2), pp. 255-277; Assarsson, L., Aarsand, P., ‘How to be good’: Media representations of parenting (2011) Studies in the Education of Adults, 43 (1), pp. 78-92; Bednarek, M., Caple, H., Why do news values matter?

In total, 8.4 million words in 57,000 posts were transformed into a structured, grammatically annotated corpus and investigated using systemic functional linguistics (SFL) as a theoretical framework, focusing on interpersonal and experiential meanings. The findings of mood and transitivity analyses show marked differences between new and veteran members’ language choices over the course of membership in the OSG: particularly, in how veteran members provide advice, and in how new and veteran members ascribe and attribute bipolar disorder to both the self and others.

Keyword analysis and concordance analysis are applied within a framework of grammatical-semantic theory of tense and modal verbs and semantic-pragmatic theory of time meaning, modality and speech acts. The results suggest, unexpectedly, that the newspapers – and news reports in particular – seem to have become less future-oriented in the period. At the same time, however, the articles – and particularly news commentary, in itself increasing – might have become slightly more speculative. Thus, the journalists themselves have become the main source of ‘guessing’, that is, predicting and speculating, with the keywords vil (will) and ville (would), including unreal and counterfactual speculations in the past tenses. © The Author(s) 2015.","Concordance analysis; corpus linguistics; counterfactual journalism; Danish newspapers; future-oriented journalism; guessing; keyword analysis; political journalism; predicting; speculating; speech acts; unreal journalism",,,,,,,,,"Baker, P., (2006) Using Corpora in Discourse Analysis, , London and New York: Bloomsbury Academic; Barnhurst, K.G., The problem of modern time in American Journalism (2011) KronoScope, 11, pp. 98-123; Barnhurst, K.G., Newspapers experiment online: Story content after a decade on the web (2013) Journalism, 14, pp. 3-21; Barnhurst, K.G., Mutz, D., American Journalism and the decline in event-centered reporting (1997) Journal of Communication, 47, pp. 26-53; Bednarek, M., (2006) Evaluation in Media Discourse: Analysis of a Newspaper Corpus, , London and New York: Continuum; Bednarek, M., Constructing ‘nerdiness’: Characterisation in The Big Bang Theory (2012) Multilingua, 31, pp. 199-229; Bell, A., (1991) The Language of News Media, , Oxford: Blackwell Publishers; Boye, K., The force-dynamic core meaning of Danish modal verbs (2001) Acta Linguistica Hafniensia: International Journal of Linguistics, 33, pp. 19-66; Dahl, Ö., The grammar of future reference in European languages (2000) Tense and Aspect in the Languages of Europe, pp. 309-328. , Berlin: Moutoe Gruyter,,.

And yet journalists and experts differ in what they consider as newsworthy and relevant. This article analyses in detail a current affair interview with a health expert reporting on a new research on attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Applying Bamberg’s three-level model for positioning analysis, the interview is searched for the stories that speakers introduce, attend to their embedding in the design of questions and answers and examine how their tellers are positioned therein as knowledgeable regarding ADHD. The narratives identified are shown to enable the adopting and shifting between various expert positions including that of the scientific researcher, the advice-giving expert and the more specific identity of the public health clinician. Shifts between these positions are shown to reflect the claims and counter-claims that the interviewee and interviewers are making and backing. These findings are discussed for their implications regarding the use of narratives in presenting science to media audiences. © 2015, The Author(s) 2015.","Conversation analysis; expert interviews; narrative analysis; news narratives; positioning; science communication; science in context; storytelling",,,,,,"European Commission, EC: FP7-PEOPLE-2012-IEF","The work leading to this article was supported as part of a Marie Curie Fellowship granted to the author by the European Union (FP7-PEOPLE-2012-IEF) and supervised by Alexandra Georgakopoulou.",,"Albaek, E., The interaction between experts and journalists in news journalism (2011) Journalism, 12 (3), pp. 335-348; Allan, S., Anderson, A., Petersen, A., Framing risk: Nanotechnologies in the news (2010) Journal of Risk Research, 13 (1), pp. 29-44; Anderson, A., Petersen, A., David, M., Communication or spin?

On 11 April 2015, in the run-up to Turkey’s parliamentary elections, a gunfight broke out in the south-eastern province of Ağrı, resulting in six Kurdish people being killed and four Turkish military personnel wounded. Although skirmishes like this are not unusual, this caught the public imagination as it became clear that Kurdish civilians had helped wounded Turkish soldiers after the shoot-out. The government denied such help and was keen to place the blame for the fight on the Kurdish opposition in its attempt to dissuade the public from voting for Kurdish-oriented parties, thereby increasing their chances of securing a parliamentary majority. The Kurds were keen to do the same to the government for the sake of votes, while the mainstream opposition saw this as an opportunity to represent the government and Kurds as poor voting options. The Turkish media, polarised and closely aligned to political interests, recontextualised events in ways which showed their political ties. This article uses critical discourse analysis to show how this was done in three national newspapers.

This text analyses the subsequent debate by identifying the discursive and rhetorical resources used by the involved parties. The analysis shows how the parties negotiate accountability, manage dilemmas of stake and what the possible social consequences of these are. Five narratives are singled out in the debate: the counter narrative, the victim narrative, the defence-speech narrative, the expert narrative and the ‘not-us-narrative’. In these narratives, the involved parties used rhetorical resources to account for reality. Hence, the gymnastics community, the research community, individuals and journalists are all portrayed as actors co-producing a social problem. © 2015, The Author(s) 2015.","Discursive and rhetorical resources; discursive psychology; gymnastics; leadership culture; media narratives; newspaper; social problem",,,,,,,,,"Abell, J., Stokoe, E.H., I take full responsibility, I take some responsibility, I’ll take half of it but no more than that’: Princess Diana and the negotiation of blame in the ‘Panorama’ interview (1999) Discourse Studies, 1 (3), pp. 297-319; Báez, J., Castañeda, M., Two sides of the same story: Media narratives of Latinos and the subprime mortgage crisis (2013) Critical Studies in Media Communication, , October,,.

Meanwhile, due to the competitive pressure and driven by profit, Chinese legal news reports are characteristic of an evident trend of marketization. This article examines how and to what extent sensationalism invades Chinese legal news reports. The research methodology combines the theoretical paradigms of critical discourse analysis and genre analysis, with particular attention paid to the notions of genre and interdiscursivity. The data include 70 legal news reports in Legal Daily. Analytical results show that Chinese legal news reports, although being a highly institutional genre, include a number of sensational strategies which promote the restructuring of legal news reports in China. © 2015, The Author(s) 2015.","Critical discourse analysis; genre; interdiscursivity; legal news reports; marketization; sensationalism",,,,,,"14SQR021

This article examines the emergence of Integrated Reporting (IR) as a new hybrid genre in which, along with financial information, organisations may choose to report the social and environmental impacts of their activities in one single document. Specifically, this article analyses a selected sample of IRs produced by early adopters to explore how discourses of sustainability have been recontextualised into financial and economic macro discourses and how different intertextual/interdiscursive relations have played out in linguistic constructions of ‘sustainability’. We contend that, by and large, the term sustainability has been appropriated, mixed with other discourses and semantically ‘bent’ to construct the organisation itself as being financially sustainable, that is, viable and profitable and for the primary benefit of shareholders. From this stance, we argue that, through the hybridity of IR, most companies have primarily colonised discourses of sustainability for the rhetorical purpose of self-legitimation. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.","Accountability; corporate social responsibility; critical discourse analysis; financial communication; genre analysis; hybridity; integrated reporting; interdiscursivity; recontextualisation; semantic bending; sustainability",,,,,,,,,"(2011), http://www.aegon.com/Documents/aegon-com-old/Sitewide/Reports-and-Other-Publications/Annual-reviews/2011/2011-Review.pdf, accessed 27 October 2014; (2013), http://www.aegon.com/Documents/aegon-com/Investors/Financial-Reporting/2013/Aegon-Review-2013.pdf, accessed 27 October 2014,) :; Anthony, L., (2012) AntConc, , Tokyo, Japan, Waseda University, (Version 3.3.2); Bakhtin, M.M., Holquist, J.M., (1981) The Dialogic Imagination: Four Essays, , Austin, TX, University of Texas Press; Bhatia, A., The corporate social responsibility report: The hybridization of a ‘Confused’ genre (2007–2011) (2012) IEEE Transactions on Professional Communication, 55, pp. 221-238; Bhatia, V.K., (1993) Analysing Genre: Language Use in Professional Settings, , London, Longman; Bhatia, V.K., Interdiscursivity in professional communication (2010) Discourse & Communication, 4, pp. 32-50; Bhatia, V.K., Critical reflections on genre analysis (2012) Iberica, 24, pp. 17-28; Bhatia, V.K., Bonini, A., Figueiredo, D.C., Rauen, F., (2012) Interdiscursivity in critical genre analysis, 1, pp. 391-400. , Proceedings from the 4th International Symposium on Gender Studies SIGET, Tubarao: Unisul,.

Viewing visitor books as situated, public media, the study asks two related questions: how museums and institutions that employ this medium frame participation of ‘ordinary’ people in the public sphere, and how, in return, visitors variously articulate their participation. The article first examines the context in which visitor books mediate participation, and how museums frame them so as to invite ‘authentic’ expressions by ‘ordinary’ visitors. The analysis depicts a taxonomy of participation, evincing five types of entitlements found in visitor book texts. These entitlements shed light on how participation in the public sphere is both understood and pursued (performed). The article responds to calls for empirically rich studies on mediation practices and processes. It adds to the literature on communicative entitlements by examining an under-researched hitherto public medium and by illuminating a shift from talk-in-interaction to the context of text-in-interaction. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.","Communicative entitlement; entitlements; heritage; media; moral discourse; museums; public sphere; texts; writing",,,,,,,,,"Blair, C., Michel, N., Reproducing civil rights tactics: The rhetorical performances of the Civil Rights Memorial (2000) Rhetoric Society Quarterly, 30 (2), pp. 31-55; Cameron, F., Kenderdine, S., (2007) Theorizing Digital Cultural Heritage: A Critical Discourse, , Cambridge, MA: MIT Press,, (eds) (; Conley, D.S., Mullen, L.J., Righting the commons in Red Rock Canyon (2008) Communication and Critical/Cultural Studies, 5 (22), pp. 180-199; Dori-Hacohen, G., The commercial and the public ‘public spheres’: Two types of political talk-radio and their constructed publics (2012) Journal of Radio and Audio Media, 19 (2), pp. 152-171; Dori-Hacohen, G., ‘With whom do I have the pleasure?’ Callers’ categories in political talk radio programs (2012) Journal of Pragmatics, 44 (3), pp. 280-297; Goffman, E., (1981) Forms of Talk, , Philadelphia, PA: University of Pennsylvania Press; Henning, M., (2006) Museums, Media and Cultural Theory, , New York: Open University Press; Hutchby, I., ‘Witnessing’: The use of first-hand knowledge in legitimating lay opinions on talk radio (2001) Discourse Studies, 3 (4), pp. 481-497; Illouz, E., (1997) Consuming the Romantic Utopia: Love and the Cultural Contradictions of Capitalism, , Berkeley, CA: University of California Press; Illouz, E., (2007) Cold Intimacies: The Making of Emotional Capitalism, , Cambridge: Polity Press; Katriel, T., (1997) Performing the Past: A Study of Israeli Settlement Museums, , Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates; Kirshenblatt-Gimblett, B., (1998) Destination Cultures: Tourism, Museums, and Heritage, , Berkeley, CA: University of California Press; Levinson, S., Putting linguistics on a proper footing: Explorations in Goffman’s concepts of participation (1988) Erving Goffman: Exploring the Interaction Order, pp. 161-227. , Boston, MA: Northeastern University Press,,.

I examine newspaper stories published in two widely circulated newspapers, The Times of India and Dainik Jagran from 17 December to 31 December, two days after the victim died of the injuries incurred during the rape on 16 December. Studies have shown that English or regional language newspapers in India do not give fair treatment in terms of coverage of incidents related to violence against women. This story, however, was different. I provide a critical discourse analysis of news reports, editorials, and comments on this episode to show that the social construction of violence against women, ideological prisms of the reporters, socio-cultural contexts of the media reports, and neoliberal subjectivity that was shaken by this episode played into the newspapers’ treatment of this news. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.","Critical discourse analysis; neoliberalism; rape; reporting; violence",,,,,,,,,"Alexander, R., Framing the female subject: The women’s section and ‘You’ (1999) Language and Communication, 19 (3), pp. 229-242; Bohner, G., Writing about rape: Use of the passive voice and other distancing text features as an expression of perceived responsibility of the victim (2001) British Journal of Social Psychology, 40, pp. 515-529; Butler, J., (1990) Gender Trouble, , New York: Routledge; Chatterjee, P., (2004) The Politics of the Governed: Reflections on Popular Politics in Most of the World, , New York: Columbia University Press; Clark, K., The linguistics of blame (1992) Language, Text, and Context, pp. 208-224. , London: Routledge,,.

The purpose of this case study was to locate one potential source of the meanings ascribed to the SA experience, through analysis of multimodal representations on the institutional website of a popular SA program provider. In this study, Kress’ model of multimodal social semiotic (MSS) communication was employed in the analysis of the ensemble of modes of communication (e.g. written language, layout, visual language) on the website, and their role in the production and dissemination of discourses of SA. Findings indicate that discourses of tourism prevail over discourses of education, and the representations enacted on the institutional website are mirrored in the discursive practices of students. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.","Communication; discourse analysis; higher education; multimodality; promotional websites; social semiotics; study abroad; tourism discourse",,,,,,,,,"(2011) Study abroad website, , http://www.arcadia.edu/studyabroad/, accessed 5 December 2011,,. :; (2015) Student network, Chile, , http://abroadcommunity.arcadia.edu/, accessed 25 July 2015,,. :; Askehave, I., Nielsen, A., Digital genres: A challenge to traditional genre theory information (2005) Technology & People, 18 (2), pp. 120-141; Our view essays: How are we doing?, , http://www.cieeorg/study/advisors/our-viewaspx, accessed 18 May 2011,, :; Davis, T.M., (2000) Open Doors Report on International Educational Exchange, , New York: Institute of International Education; Fairclough, N., (2006) Language and Globalization, , New York: Routledge; Fairclough, N., Wodak, R., Critical discourse analysis (1997) Discourse as Social Interaction, pp. 258-284. , London: SAGE,,.

This article aims to address this gap by conducting a case study of innocent, a UK producer of fruit juices. Combining corpus analytical tools with discourse analytical techniques and considering both text and multimodal features, we explore some of the strategies through which innocent creates a set of inter-related and closely intertwined identities on its website, thereby constructing the company’s brand image. However, our findings also reveal that some of the company’s identity claims (especially in relation to being an inclusive and welcoming ‘family’) are relativised and to some extent contradicted by the discursive processes through which these claims are articulated. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.","Corpus analysis; discourse analysis; identity construction; website",,,,,,,,,"Anderson, E., Richard Reed: From innocent smoothies to changing the world (2014) The Telegraph, , http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/businessclub/11154017/Richard-Reed-from-Innocent-Smoothies-to-changing-the-world.html, October, accessed 7 July 2015,,. :; Angouri, J., Marra, M., (2011) Constructing Identities at Work, , Houndmills: Palgrave Macmillan; Aston, G., Burnard, L., (1998) The BNC Handbook: Exploring The British National Corpus With SARA, , Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press; Baker, P., Levon, E., Picking the right cherries?

Three commercials from the food and beverage category are selected on the basis of the country of origin of the endorsing company and the patterns of glocalization. Multimodal discourse analysis reveals that the commercials construct the glocal identity in several ways. In the Knorr Soups commercial, the melody of the title song is contemporary pop, whereas the delivery style and crooning are distinctively Western. The language is predominantly Hindi with deft use of selected English words. The Funda Mint commercial casts a rebel voice-support executive who rejects the pseudo-glocal identity and asserts his true identity. In the Cadbury Bournvita Folk commercial, the two boys represent the global and the local in the realm of creativity. The study advances the knowledge of product positioning and brand identity involving the intersemiosis of discursive elements from different cultural spaces within the contemporary Indian consumerist culture. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.","Cultural identity; food and beverage; glocalization; Indian TV commercials; multimodal discourse analysis",,,,,,,,,"Baldry, A.P., (2000) Multimodality and Multimediality in the Distance Learning Age, , Campobasso: Palladino Editore,, (ed.)

Discursive analysis found that immigrant groups were discussed by about one-third of respondents in predominantly negative ways. People employed categorization, comparison, consensus, generalizations, metaphors, rhetorical questions, and directive speech acts to discuss the commercial and immigration, more generally. The frequent presence of such negative responses to the commercial suggests that anti-immigrant sentiments continue and possibly are intensifying among segments of the population in the United States.

This article addresses this question by analyzing the discourse of CSR consultants with the aim of understanding how they deal with such tensions through identity work. Our findings suggest that people who claim, or who are ascribed, paradoxical professional identities may engage in ‘paradoxical identity mitigation’ – a process whereby the concomitant and paradoxical use of linguistic strategies is aimed at simultaneously embracing and distancing oneself from contradictory identity demands. In uncovering how CSR professionals discursively manage the tensions engendered by CSR commodification, our results also advance current knowledge of CSR by shedding light on the underlying processes whereby new ‘hybrid’ identities are constituted and mobilized by actors to make sense of their professional activities. © 2015, © The Author(s) 2015.","Consultants; corporate social responsibility; identity; paradox",,,,,,"Fonds de Recherche du QuÃ©bec-SociÃ©tÃ© et Culture, FRQSC

In spoken interaction (face-to-face), we orient to this difficulty through the design of our responses. An agreement response (preferred) is characteristically said straightaway with minimal gap between request and response. A disagreement response (dispreferred) is characteristically delayed through silence and by prefacing the disagreement turn with tokens such as ‘well’, ‘uhm’ and ‘uh’ or with accounts as to why the recipient cannot accept the request or invitation. The question for this article concerns what occurs when requests or invitations are made via texting. The results from 329 texting interactions showed that if responses to a request or invitation were delayed by more than 1 minute, it was much more likely be a ‘no’ rather than a ‘yes’ response (p<0.001). In other words, preferred responses were sent quickly; dispreferred responses were delayed. Understanding texting as social interaction is increasingly important as the range of communicative options continues to widen (e.g. Facebook, Short Message Service (SMS), Multimedia Messaging Service (MMS), Instant Messaging (IM), email). This study shows preference organisation similarities between spoken interaction and texting with texters orienting to social norms concerning delayed responses. Further research is needed to understand in what contexts a person might choose one communicative medium over another. © 2015, © The Author(s) 2015.","Cell phones; conversation analysis; dispreferred responses; invitations; mobile phones; preference organisation; preferred responses; requests; texting; time delay",,,,,,,,,"Anderson, J.F., Beard, F.K., Walther, J.B., Turn-taking and the local management of conversation in a highly simultaneous computer-mediated communication system (2010) Language@Internet, 7. , http://www.languageatinternet.org/articles/2010/2804, 7, accessed 12 July 2013; Baron, N.S., Discourse structures in Instant Messaging: The case of utterance breaks (2010) Language@Internet, 7. , http://www.languageatinternet.org/articles/2010/2651, 4, accessed 12 July 2013; Bryant, J.A., Sanders-Jackson, A., Smallwood, A.M.K., IMing, text messaging, and adolescent social networks (2006) Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication, 11 (2), p. 10. , http://jcmc.indiana.edu/vol11/issue2/bryant.html, accessed 12 July 2013; (2013) Chart of the day: Kids send a mind boggling number of texts every month, , http://www.businessinsider.com.au/chart-of-the-day-number-of-texts-sent-2013-3, accessed 8 November 2014; Clayman, S., Address terms in the service of other actions: The case of news interview talk (2010) Discourse & Communication, 4 (2), pp. 161-183; (2012) Communications report 2011–2012, , http://www.acma.gov.au/webwr/_assets/main/lib550049/comms_report_2011-12.pdf, accessed 8 November 2014; Crystal, D., (2001) Language and the Internet, , Cambridge: Cambridge University Press; Goffman, E., (1961) Encounters, , New York: Bobbs-Merrill; Hedbring, S., (2002) Mobile messaging usability – Social and pragmatic aspects, , http://cid.nada.kth.se/pdf/CID-192.pdf, CID, Centre for User Oriented IT Design, Royal Institute of Technology; Heritage, J., (1984) Garfinkel and Ethnomethodology, , Cambridge: Polity Press; Herring, S., Computer-mediated discourse (2003) The Handbook of Discourse Analysis, , http://www.blackwellreference.com.virtual.anu.edu.au/subscriber/tocnode.html?id=g9780631205968_chunk_g978063120596832, Schiffrin D., Tannen D., Hamilton H.E., (eds), Blackwell Publishing,,.

As such, these texts become accessible for study, critique and evaluation. Additionally, discourses previously confined to the written domain are now increasingly multimodal. Thus, an approach is required that is capable of relating detailed, complex multimodal discourse analyses to broader sociocultural perspectives to account for the complex meaning-making practices that operate in online leadership discourses. For this purpose, a digital multimodal discourse approach is proposed and illustrated via a small-scale case study of the online leadership discourse of an Australian university. The analysis of two short video texts demonstrates how a digital multimodal discourse perspective facilitates the identification of key multimodal systems used for meaning-making in online communication, how meaning arises through combinations of semiotic choices (not individual choices), and how the results of multimodal discourse analysis using digital technology can reveal larger sociocultural patterns – in this case, divergent leadership styles and approaches as reflected in online discourse, at a time of immense change within the higher education sector. © 2015, © The Author(s) 2015.","Collegial and managerial leadership; digital multimodal discourse perspective; multimodal analysis; online leadership discourse; social semiotics; university leadership communication",,,,,,,,,"Bateman, J., Looking for what counts in film analysis: A programme of empirical research (2014) Visual Communication, pp. 301-329. , Machin D., (ed), Berlin: De Gruyter Mouton,,.

In this program, young male and female lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) participants, who have not come out yet for various reasons, reveal their homosexuality to their family, peers, and colleagues while being documented on camera. We problematize the compatibility of the genre ‘reality television’, which by definition focuses on personal emotions and conflict, with subjects that have emancipatory goals, such as the creation of more awareness for and acceptance of homosexuality. The data reveal that in the show LGB emancipation is framed as a personal problem and not as a socio-political issue with moral and ideological dimensions. In the end, we argue, the effect could very well be that the show does not promote but rather – ironically – hinders LGB emancipation. © 2015, © The Author(s) 2015.","Coming out; critical discourse analysis; difference discourse; discursivity; ethnography of communication; face; gender; heteronormativity; homosexuality; media; privacy discourse; reality TV; social practices; stigma",,,,,,,,,"Austin, J., (1962) How to Do Things with Words, , Oxford: Oxford University Press; Beck, D., Hellmueller, L., Aeschbacher, N., Factual entertainment and reality TV (2012) Communication Research Trends, 31 (2), pp. 4-27; Biressi, A., Nunn, H., (2005) Reality TV: Realism and Revelation, , London: Wallflower Press; Brown, P., Levinson, S., (1978) Politeness: Some Universals in Language Use, , Cambridge: Cambridge University Press; Cameron, D., Kulick, D., (2003) Language and Sexuality, , Cambridge: Cambridge University Press; Chirrey, D.A., ‘I hereby come out’: What sort of speech act is coming out?

It considers such signifiers as rhetorical devices to influence the prospective subscribers to invest in shares, thereby saving for the proverbial rainy day. Data for the study comprise eight adverts culled from some of Nigeria’s national daily newspapers and news magazines between March and December 2005. Lemke’s multimodal semiotic theory and Barthes’ conception of the interaction of signs as encapsulated in the concepts of ‘anchorage’ and ‘relay’ provide the theoretical perspective for the data analysis. The study reveals that the advertisers creatively blend verbal and visual cues in the discourse largely to elicit certain sensibilities in the readers so as to make them think and act in the direction of the investment offer being touted. Generally, the advertisers’ appropriation of culture-specific issues in the Nigerian context, building a strong and credible brand to enhance the integrity of the respective banks and harping on the exigency of keying into the investment offers, serves as useful rhetorical appeals for the effectiveness of the multimodal semiotic resources in the discourse. © 2015, © The Author(s) 2015.","Bank recapitalisation; investment; multimodality; Nigeria; shares offers",,,,,,,,,"Abdullahi, I.B., Banking sector reforms and consolidation in Nigeria: Challenges and prospects (2007) BJMASS, 6 (1), pp. 116-125. , https://www.unilorin.edu.ng/publications/abdullahiib/scan0002.pdf; Abdullahi, S.A., Assessment of the impact of banking sector consolidation on the real sector of the Nigerian economy (2009) Journal of Finance and Accounting Research, 1 (3), pp. 1-23. , https://www.academia.edu/315018/Journal_of_Finance_and_Accounting_Research._Volume_1_Number_3_SEPTEMBER_2009; Abdulraheem, A., Consolidating the banking sector reforms (2006) Perspectives on Nation-building and Development in Nigeria, pp. 239-249. , Saliu H.A., Aderinto A.A., Jimoh H.I., (eds), Ilorin, Nigeria: Faculty of Social and Business Sciences, University of Ilorin; Abdurahman, S., An exploration of the performances of the Nigerian capital market before and after banking sector consolidation exercise (2001–2010) (2013) Kuwait Chapters of Arabian Journal of Business and Management Review, 2 (6), pp. 8-16; Adeusi, S., Oke, M., Impact of bank consolidation on Nigeria economic growth (2013) International Journal of Innovative Research and Development, 2 (5), pp. 1196-1212; Awolusi, O.D., Empirical assessment of merger and acquisition implementation on customer service management in the Nigerian banking industry (2012) Universal Journal of Marketing and Business Research, 1 (4), pp. 112-122; Barthes, R., (1977) Image, Music and Text, , London: Fontana Press; Bello, Y.A., Banking sector consolidation in Nigeria and some regional experiences: Challenges and prospects (2005) CBN Journal, 29 (2), pp. 46-49; Ernest, I.E., Bank consolidation in Nigeria: Marketing implications and challenges for the surviving banks (2012) Arts and Social Sciences Journal, 31, pp. 1-15. , http://astonjournals.com/manuscripts/Vol2012/ASSJ-31_Vol2012.pdf; Authorised King James Version Thessalonians; Kress, G., Van Leeuwen, T., (2001) Multimodal Discourse: The Modes and Media of Contemporary Communication, , Oxford: Oxford University Press; Kress, G., Van Leeuwen, T., (2006) Reading Images: The Grammar of Visual Design, , 2nd edn., London: Routledge; Kress, G., Leite-Garcia, R., van Leeuwen, T., Discourse semiotics (1997) Discourse as Structure and Process, pp. 257-291. , Van Dijk T., (ed), London: SAGE,,.

A supplementary data set of ethnographic semi-structured interviews with professional team sports players is also used to develop insider perspectives on the discursive behaviour of professional team sports players when speaking to the media. What is argued is that the acts and stances employed by team sports players can be interpreted as indexing a media self, or media identity, one that professional team sports players construct in order to strategically negotiate a public version of self that presents them positively to their audience and maintains their relationships with other members of their team. © 2015, © The Author(s) 2015.","Identity construction; media discourse; media identity; professional sports player discourse",,,,,,,,,"Altheide, D., The media self (1984) The Existential Self in Society, pp. 177-195. , Kotarba J., Fontana A., (eds), Chicago, IL: University of Chicago Press,,.

It focuses more specifically on the case of Saudi Arabia to show how television interviewers there have performed their roles throughout three different phases. The first phase covers the period when the media was still controlled by Arab governments, the second focuses on the advent of satellite and the third focuses on the aftermath of the recent series of uprisings which has become known as the Arab Spring. An examination of these three phases, which includes a discussion of some illustrative examples, will show how television interviewers have shifted from initially taking a very cautious and overtly deferential approach with interviewees, officials and public figures to adopting a more aggressive approach in the third phase. © 2015, © The Author(s) 2015.","Aggressiveness; Arab media; broadcast interviews; conversation analysis; media talk",,,,,,"King Saud University, KSU","This study was funded through a scholarship from King Saud University, Saudi Arabia.",,"Adkins, B., Arguing the point: The management and context of disputatious challenges in radio current affairs interviews (1992) Australian Journalism Review, 14, pp. 37-49; Saudi Arabia ranks first in YouTube views (2012) Al Arabiya News, , http://www.alarabiya.net/articles/2012/05/22/215774.html; (2012) Al-ʿAwdah yataḥaddā manʿ Asʾilat al-Thawrah, , http://www.aleqt.com/2012/03/21/article_638949.html; Alfahad, A., (2013) A conversation analysis of aggressiveness and deference in Arabic news interviews, , Leeds University, Leeds:,.

The Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC) recently released an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) and takes questions from the New York State Assembly. Assembly members pose concerns with the EIS. The DEC’s responses at times appear to not address the question, but rather to challenge or rework the question in a way that can be answered from the DEC perspective. Assembly members assess seeming evasive answers in critical ways. This interactional pattern is examined from a discursive analysis perspective as problem–accounts–assessments sequences. Especially notable are the discursive practices of reported speech and metadiscourse in these accounting sequences. The conflicting assessments are not based on ‘the facts’, but on which facts are relevant. The DEC can be heard as advocating for their draft of the EIS despite the concerns raised by the Assembly. At certain junctures, Assembly members accuse the DEC of being biased or evasive, which does not make for the trust needed to reach consensus. At stake in this hearing is the construction of environmental or public health risk and whether or not to permit hydrofracking. © 2015, © The Author(s) 2015.","Accounts; assessment; environmental controversy; environmental impact statement; hydrofracking; inter-governmental hearing",,,,,,,,,"Boholm, Å., The public meeting as a theatre of dissent: Risk and hazard in land use and environmental planning (2008) Journal of Risk Research, 11, pp. 119-140; Boholm, Å., Speaking of risk: Matters of context (2009) Environmental Communication: A Journal of Nature and Culture, 3, pp. 335-354; Bora, A., Hausendorf, H., Participatory science governance revisited: Normative expectations versus empirical evidence (2006) Science and Public Policy, 33, pp. 478-488; Boynton, G.R., When senators and publics meet at the Environmental Protection Subcommittee (1991) Discourse & Society, 2, pp. 131-155; Buttny, R., (1993) Social Accountability in Communication, , London: SAGE; Buttny, R., Citizen participation, metadiscourse and accountability: A public hearing on a zoning change for Wal-Mart (2010) Journal of Communication, 60, pp. 636-659; Clayman, S.E., Footing in the achievement of neutrality: The case of news interview discourse (1992) Talk at Work: Interaction in Institutional Settings, pp. 163-198. , Drew P., Heritage J., (eds), New York: Cambridge University Press,,.

Following a critical social semiotic approach, the analysis of intersemiotic relationships demonstrates that approximately half of the semiotic texts analyzed communicate an overall transformative message by challenging the negative representations of Latin@s in the mainstream media. The strong presence of transformative ideologies in the verbal and visual modes underscores the potential for Spanish-language media to represent Latin@s as powerful social actors who stand up to negative treatment through activism. Moreover, the contrast of ideologies across the verbal and visual modes may incite the audience to participate in activism that supports Latin@ immigrants in the United States. © 2015, © The Author(s) 2015.","Critical discourse analysis; ideology; intersemiotic relationship; social semiotics; Spanish-language media",,,,,,,,,"Baptista da Silva, P., Rosemberg, F., Negros y blancos en los media brasileños: el discurso racista y las prácticas de resistencia (2007) Racismo y Discurso en América Latina, pp. 89-136. , Van Dijk T., (ed), Barcelona: Gedisa,, ].

Using the classic Aristotelian tripartition of logos, ethos, and pathos, the article unfolds the argumentative structure of the controversies. Carter and Saramago used the combination of their own personal status and the controversial nature of their analogies to trigger a debate. Commentators focused very much on the ethos (arguments around the authority and the character of the authors) and the pathos, and tended to ignore the logos (the factual relevance of the analogy). Opponents, who made up the majority of commentators, considered analogies as a way of passing judgment on and mobilizing against one of the actors in the conflict (Israel in our cases). This analysis suggests that despite the call for a more cautious use of (or even a prohibition of) the analogies discussed, participants in the debate on the Israeli–Palestinian conflicts are bound to resort to them – even if only to condemn them. © 2015, © The Author(s) 2015.","Apartheid; argumentation; Auschwitz; Carter; discourse analysis; historical analogy; Israeli–Palestinian conflict; press analysis; public controversy; rhetoric; Saramago; Shoah",,,,,,,,,"Bishara, M., (2003) Palestine/Israel: Peace or Apartheid, , London: Zed Books,, (French edition 2001); Bourdon, J., (2009) Le Récit Impossible: Le conflit israélo-palestinien et les médias (The Impossible Narrative.

We observed and recorded Israeli children talk in everyday, natural settings in two separate studies, in 1999–2002 and in 2012–2013. Detailed discourse analysis of television-based interactions from an ethnographic, child-centered perspective reveals the enduring centrality of television as an enjoyable, available, and shared cultural resource with valuable social, cognitive, and discursive affordances: it is frequently mentioned during everyday adult-free interactions; utilized as the basis for drawing and negotiating boundaries and hierarchies within the peer community; and facilitates experiencing a variety of discursive literacy skills, ranging between practicing adherence to original texts and creativity and distancing from them. These findings provide further evidence for the mediatization of everyday life, and may have educational implications, which are discussed. © 2015, © The Author(s) 2015.","Child discourse; discursive literacy; media discourse; mediatization; peer talk; pretend play; television-based interactions",,,,,,"Israel Science Foundation, ISF

The perspective of the research is interdisciplinary, its methodology is qualitative, and the process guiding the textual analysis is inductive and hermeneutic. The corpus is made up of the news related to the studied legislative process. The news analysis was carried out according to the proposal of a Sociological and Linguistic Discourse Analysis. Thus, the argumentative strategies and the linguistic resources deployed were associated with the interpretive models of reality underlying those texts, and moreover, the similarities and differences among the various news articles were examined as regards the representation of (a) working conditions; (b) workers and employers and their respective rights and obligations; (c) the legitimacy, need, and legality of the regulation passed; (d) the scope of the protection granted to workers; and (e) the effect of this regulation on workers’ constitutional rights and guarantees. © The Author(s) 2015","Categorization; media discourse; political discourse; social representations; sociological and linguistic discourse analysis; working conditions",,,,,,"Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones CientÃ­ficas y TÃ©cnicas, CONICET

It tries to explore how media discourse can be constructed to facilitate crisis control in natural disaster situations. Set in a context of nationalistic culture in contemporary China, this paper dissects how state media in China frame narratives and represent meanings to construct national cultural identity in earthquake coverage. In analysing this discursive process, this research adopts the methodology of critical discourse analysis and cluster criticism; the findings indicate that the discourse of resistance deals with the disorderly information flow in a crisis by differentiating the messages, framing media stories and engaging with the broad nationalistic culture, to construct positive representations of disaster relief. Specifically, a strong sense of belonging to a national community is constructed for people trapped in uncertainty, anxiety and trauma. This study concludes that, in doing so, discourse of resistance enhances disaster relief by controlling the meaning of the crisis. © The Author(s) 2015","Chinese state media; crisis control; discourse analysis; discourse of resistance; meaning production; media framing; national cultural identity; nationalistic culture; signifying practice; the Wenchuan earthquake",,,,,,,"This study was funded by China Scholarship Council University of Adelaide Joint Postgraduate Fellowship.",,"Alexander, J.C., Jacobs, R.N., (1998) Media, Ritual and Identity, pp. 23-41. , Liebes TCurran J, ed.

The link between ineffective communication, patient dissatisfaction and critical incidents is well established. Family Planning New South Wales (FPNSW) has sought to address patient-centred care and communication in its policy platform. This article reports on research conducted within FPNSW, which analysed the discourse features that constituted effective doctor–patient1 communication in sexual and reproductive health consultations. The principal aim of the research was to understand how effectively messages were conveyed and received and to what degree patients were active participants in their own sexual healthcare. Analysed consultations were characterised by extremely high levels of communicative competence on the part of the doctors who integrated medical expertise with the development of interpersonal relationships with patients, thus positioning patients as active contributors to the consultations and to decisions about their ongoing treatment. The detailed linguistic analysis identified characteristic features of patient-centred communication that are essential to patient-centred care. These interactions demonstrate that communicating care is just as important as delivering care and involves a drawing together of the medical and the interpersonal in consultations. The article details strategies for interweaving medical knowledge and establishing rapport that can inform practitioner communication practices across different healthcare contexts. © The Author(s) 2015","Clinical consultations; communication strategies; discourse of sexual health; family planning discourse; healthcare communication; linguistic analysis; medical discourse; patient-centred healthcare; reproductive and sexual health; research",,,,,,,,,"http://www.safetyandquality.gov.au/publications/nsqhs-standards-fact-sheet-standard-6-clinical-handover, Australian Commission on Safety and Quality in Health Care (ACSQHC) (2010) Clinical Handover.

While previous studies have mostly explored the discourse of nuclear proliferation through the analysis of newspaper texts, few have considered corpora from different sites or considered the changes, transformations and contradictions that take place when meanings are delocated from one site and relocated in another. Elements of poststructuralist discourse theory, critical linguistics and corpus linguistics are brought together to consider how events were constructed within two corpora: UN Security Council (UNSC) resolutions and newspaper articles published in prominent UK and US broadsheets. WordSmith Tools (Version 5) was used to analyse word frequencies, statistical patterns of keywords, word collocation profiles and concordance patterns. Results indicate that the most salient lexical items refer to actors, strategic actions and technologies. As these constituents of nuclear proliferation are delocated from the political sphere and relocated in the public sphere, three discursive strategies unfold: personalisation, normalisation or exceptionalisation, and reification. © The Author(s) 2015.","Corpus analysis; critical linguistics; discourse; international relations; newspapers; resolutions; security; UNSC",,,,,,"University of Warwick: RDF1063","The research was supported by a University of Warwick Strategic Award (RDF1063).",,"Agamben, G., (2005) State of Exception, , Chicago, IL: ; :, The University of Chicago Press; Baker, P., Representations of Islam in British Broadsheet and Tabloid Newspapers (2010) Journal of Language and Politics, 9 (2), pp. 310-338; Baker, P., (2006) Using Corpora in Discourse Analysis, , London: ; :, Continuum; Baker, P., McEnery, T., A corpus-based approach to discourses of refugees and asylum seekers in UN and newspaper texts (2005) Journal of Language and Politics, 4, pp. 197-226; Bakhtin, M., (1981) The Dialogic Imagination: Four Essays, , Austin, TX: ; :, University of Texas Press; Behnam, B., Zenouz, R.M., (2008) Systemic Functional Linguistics in Use: Odense Working Papers in Language and Communication, pp. 199-218. , Nørgaard N, ed.

One aim is to test and evaluate the integration of corpus techniques in applying discursive news values analysis (DNVA). We employ and evaluate corpus techniques that have not been tested previously in relation to the large-scale analysis of news values. These techniques include tagged lemma frequencies, collocation, key part-of-speech tags (POStags) and key semantic tags. A secondary aim is to gain insights into how a specific happening – Hurricane Katrina – was linguistically constructed as newsworthy in major American news media outlets, thus also making a contribution to ecolinguistics. © The Author(s) 2015.","corpus linguistics; news discourse; News values; newsworthiness; tagging",,,,,,"Economic and Social Research Council, ESRC: ES/K002155/1","This work was supported in part by the ESRC Centre for Corpus Approaches to Social Science [grant number ES/K002155/1].",,"http://ucrel.lancs.ac.uk/usas/usasguide.pdf, ArcherDWilsonARaysonP (2002) Introduction to the USAS category system.

Differences are identified in the reporting strategies of The Guardian, Daily Mail and The Sun that provide insight into the ideology of the British press. There is significant variation in the style, content and stances of each newspaper towards state surveillance, as well as clear evidence of ideology within each paper: The Guardian is critical of surveillance and defensive of its decision to publish classified documents; the Daily Mail focuses heavily on personalisation and the personal life of Edward Snowden; and The Sun perpetuates an us/them ideology that is highly supportive of state surveillance. These differences are motivated by each newspaper’s ideology, news values and audience considerations and demonstrate how British newspapers offer radically different perspectives on the same events. © The Author(s) 2015","Comparative keyword analysis; corpus; Critical Discourse Analysis; Edward Snowden; ideology; press; surveillance",,,,,,,,,"http://www.antlab.sci.waseda.ac.jp/, AnthonyL (2011) AntConc, version 3.2.2 (Computer Software).

One analyst used a 41.5 million word corpus of articles, while the other focused on a down-sampled set of 51 articles from the same corpus. The two ensuing research reports were then critically compared in order to elicit shared and unique findings and to highlight strengths and weaknesses between the two approaches.

The focus of the analysis is upon the contrast between how the event was reacted to by the UK National Press and on social media. To explore this contrast, we undertook a corpus-assisted discourse analysis to look at three periods during the event: the initial attack, the verdict of the subsequent trial and the sentencing of the murderers. To do this, we constructed and analysed corpora of press and Twitter coverage of the attack, the conviction of the suspects and the sentencing of them. The analysis shows that social media and the press are intertwined, with the press exerting a notable influence through social media, but social media not always being led by the press. When looking at social media reaction to such an event as this, analysts should always consider the role that the press are playing in forming that discourse. © The Author(s) 2015","Corpus analysis; ideology; media; murder; twitter",,,,,,"Economic and Social Research Council, ESRC

These conceptual frameworks are capable of influencing how readers perceive and interpret news events, ultimately influencing their behavior as consumers and the financial decisions they make. This article explores the relationship between editorial positioning and ideology in financial news and the types or ontologies of metaphors used to describe the nature of the stock market via reporting on the stock market crash of 2008 in online news media. Results indicate a statistically significant preference for TheNew York Times and The Wall Street Journal, liberally positioned newspapers, for animate-biological metaphors which promote understanding of the stock market in terms of a living being that must be ‘nurtured’ through intervention as opposed to being ‘left alone’, which is more consistent with laissez-faire approaches to economic crisis scenarios. © The Author(s) 2014.","crisis solution marketing (CSM); Critical discourse analysis; financial news reporting; frames; ideology; metaphor; metaphor ontology; online journalism",,,,,,,,,"Boers, F., (1997) Voices of Power: Co-operation and Conflict in English Language and Literatures, , Maufort Mvan Noppen J-P, ed.

Representations of the situation in the media shape how citizens understand and respond to it. We explore the role of proximity in media discourse about the closing of a coal-fired power plant near Waynesburg, a small city in a Pennsylvania coal-mining region. Comparing reporting in smaller-circulation newspapers closer to the site with reporting in larger-circulation regional newspapers, we find that Waynesburg-area papers simply describe the events leading to the closure while regional papers analyze the events in larger contexts, and that politicians, not the plant owners, are represented as blaming environmentalists for job loss. Our findings point to the importance of proximity in environmental discourse and to the need to examine not only what kinds of discourse circulate, but also how and to whom. © The Author(s) 2014.","Circulation; coal mining; discourse and place; energy generation; environmental discourse; environmental regulation; FirstEnergy; job blackmail; news reporting; newspapers; Pennsylvania; proximity",,,,,,,,,"https://www.firstenergycorp.com/content/fecorp/newsroom/news_releases/firstenergy-to-deactivate-two-coal-fired-power-plants-in-pennsyl.html, FirstEnergy (2013) FirstEnergy to deactivate two coal-fired power plants in Pennsylvania, 9July.

This article aims to investigate how Muslim women are represented in BBC News website texts using a purpose-built corpus (1.9 million words in 3269 articles). The research employs analytical tools from the discourse-historical, socio-cognitive, and sociosemantic approaches to critical discourse studies. These are combined with corpus-based methodologies to investigate the semantic macrostructures that tend to be associated with Muslim women and the discursive strategies employed in the representation of the hijab. The study is novel in its exhaustive approach to identifying salient and underreported issues related to Muslim women in news discourse. It also introduces a more integrated analysis that combines manual and automated techniques and tackles the quantification of qualitative results where possible. Findings suggest that Muslim women’s representations are largely restricted in terms of regional coverage. Semantic macrostructures related to conflict and crime are prevalent. The hijab remains a nodal discourse surrounding Muslim women whose function as a descriptive feature is often unclear, raising serious questions about its relevance. A number of recommendations are made for journalists to become cognizant of their own context models when reporting on Muslim women. © The Author(s) 2014.","BBC; corpus linguistics; critical discourse analysis; Muslim women; news discourse; online news",,,,,,,"This research was kindly funded through a scholarship from the Saudi Arabian Institute of Public Administration.",,"Abbas, T., Media capital and the representation of South Asian Muslims in the British press: An ideological analysis (2001) Journal of Muslim Minority Affairs, 21 (2), pp. 245-257; Abu Odeh, L., Post-colonial feminism and the veil: Thinking the difference (1993) Feminist Review, 43, pp. 26-37; Afshar, H., Aitken, R., Franks, M., Feminisms, Islamophobia and identities (2005) Political Studies, 53 (2), pp. 262-283; Ahmad, F., British Muslim perceptions and opinions on news coverage of (2006) Journal of Ethnic and Migration Studies, 32 (6), pp. 961-982; Ahmed, L., (2005) On Shifting Ground: Muslim Women in the Global Era, pp. 153-171. , Nouraie-Simone F, ed.

We use critical discourse analysis, notions of remediation and immediacy to scrutinize discourse structures and other discursive strategies designed to conceal mediation and authorial prejudices, and to make the reader ‘experience’ the actual content. In addition to making the anti-immigrant rhetoric appear legitimate, and the danger immediate and real, we argue that the apparent seamless content is often biased by selection and structured in such a way as to deny voice to immigrants and their advocates. Among other things, we conclude that since the readers’ interpretations are filtered through lenses of subjectivities defined by communicative contexts characterized by job scarcity, poverty, crime and wanting healthcare, the news content heightens anxiety and miseducates more than it enlightens readers on migration issues. Hence there is a danger of SAM becoming unwitting conveyors of the same vices they preach against. © The Author(s) 2014.","Communicative contexts; discourse structures; immediacy; immigration; media; moral panics; remediation; South Africa; xenophobia; Zimbabwe",,,,,,,,,"Bolter, J., Grusin, R., (1999) Remediation: Understanding New Media, , Cambridge, MA: ; :, MIT Press; Cohen, S., (2002) Folk Devils and Moral Panics: The Creation of the Mods and Rockers, , London: ; :, Routledge; http://www.queensu.ca/samp/sampresources/samppublications/policybriefs/brief25.pdf, CrushJ (2011) Complex movements, confused responses: Labour migration in South Africa.

As opposed to other studies that have applied it to the United States, Finland, etc., it applies this theory to an African (Nigerian) political debate. It asserts as against others that candidates distinguish themselves from their opponents using the major functions of campaign discourse in a reversed order, that is, attacks, defences and acclaims rather than acclaims, attacks and defences which is popular in US debates. Furthermore, it also examines how attacks are pragmatically encoded by candidates in Lagos State debate, what illocutionary forms candidates utilize when informing voters of an opponent’s potential costs/weakness. Thus, this current study can be viewed as a comparative study that aims to unravel a sequence present in Nigerian debate different from what is obtainable in US political debates. © The Author(s) 2014.","Acclaims; attacks; defences; functional theory of campaign discourse; illocution; political debate",,,,,,,,,"An, C., Pfau, M., The efficacy of inoculation in televised political debates (2004) Journal of Communication, 54, pp. 421-436; Benoit, W.L., (1999) Seeing Spots: A Functional Analysis of Presidential Television Advertisements from 1952–1996, , New York: ; :, Praeger; Benoit, W.L., (2002) The Primary Decision.

In this article, we propose to decenter our analytical position by acknowledging what artifacts, tools and architectural elements contribute to human activities and practices. Starting from a 'ventriloqual' perspective on communication, we demonstrate that the accountable character of people's activities presupposes a form of material agency that tends to be neglected in our analyses. Far from neglecting human beings' contributions to their own activities, we show that this approach allows us to acknowledge their capacity to skillfully react and respond to what things indicate, say, or tell them to do. It is, we contend, in this back-and-forth process of actions and reactions that a certain dialogicity of things can be recognized. Decentering the analytical position by focusing on how things traceably contribute to shaping human interactions has, we contend, dramatic theoretical and methodological consequences. In the discussion we argue that resistance in taking a ventriloqual perspective to analyze the social life of things partially depends on its impact on the sensitive notion of responsibility. © The Author(s) 2013.","Actor-Network Theory; artifacts; doctor-nurse communication; embodied interaction; health care practices; interaction analysis; material agency; materiality; repair; responsibility; speech acts; ventriloquism; workplace studies",,,,,,,"This ethnographic study is part of a larger research project (Phenomenology of Infectious Diseases in Intensive Care Units, PHENICE), financed by the ‘Mario Negri’ Institute for Pharmacological Research (Milan, Italy) coordinated by Dr Guido Bertolini.

'Women' as a social category is made relevant to this study by virtue of the lack of female senior leaders in UK businesses (Sealy and Vinnicombe, 2013). Much previous research has analysed leadership discourse in mixed gender groups, relying on theories that imply comparisons between men and women. Using an Interactional Sociolinguistic approach, this study aims to learn more about how women perform leadership in the absence of men by analysing the spoken interactions of a women-only team who were engaged in a competitive leadership task. The analysis reveals that the women accomplish leadership in multiple and complex ways that defy binary gendered classifications. Nonetheless, there is a distinctive gendered dynamic to the team's interactions which, it is argued, might be disadvantageous to women aspiring to senior positions. © The Author(s) 2013.","Discourse; feminist linguistics; gender; Interactional Sociolinguistic analysis; leadership language; management team meetings",,,,,,,,,"Angouri, J., We are in a masculine profession...'

Bhatia's (2002) framework of applied genre theory was central to this study of the letters to the editor corpus that focused on textual links, rhetorical structure, and argumentative patterns in the Pakistani LE discourse. The corpus-driven discourse analysis demonstrated diversity in organization patterns, and the juxtaposition of general discussion, references to particular incidents, and personal accounts, exhibiting what Bhatia (2002) calls the 'seemingly chaotic realities' of a society in transition. The findings reveal an overwhelming dissatisfaction of the people vis-a-vis life in general, and the government and its seemingly insurmountable distance from Pakistani people, more specifically. The study draws attention to letters to the editor as a resistant genre in public discourse. © The Author(s) 2013.","Corpus; discourse analysis; genre; letters to the editor; Pakistan; public discourse",,,,,,,,,"Ambrosi, E., Tissardo, M., (1991) Dalla Parte Del Lettore: Ricerca Sulla Posta Deil Quotidiani Italini, , Rome: Edizioni Iavaoro; Anderson, B., (1991) Imagined Communities: Reflections on the Origin and Spread of Nationalism, , London: Verso Books; Atkins, A., Richardson, E., Arguing about Muslims: (Un)Reasonable argumentation in letters to the editor (2007) Text & Talk, 27 (1), pp. 1-25; Baker, P.P., Gabrielatos, C., KhosraviNik, M., A useful methodological synergy?

A sole concentration on the production of new knowledge and the education of students does not ensure the prosperity or even survival of universities any longer, and equally important are the admission of elite students, the outcome-based evaluation of academic performance, the establishment of alumni network and also fundraising. This article examines how and to what extent this trend of marketization has invaded the order of discourse of Chinese universities. The research methodology combines the paradigms of critical discourse analysis (CDA) and the tenets of critical genre analysis [Bhatia VK (2007) Towards critical genre analysis. In: Bhatia VK, Flowerdew J and Jones RH (eds) Advances in Discourse Studies. London: Routledge, pp. 166-177], with particular attention paid to the notion of genre, interdiscursivity and conversationalization. The texts examined include ceremonial speeches, regulatory documents, insiders' accounts and field notes. Analytical results show that the trend of marketization, in spite of a potential threat for academic integrity, does facilitate the institutional restructuring and transformation of universities in the context of Mainland China. © The Author(s) 2013.","Conversationalization; higher education; institution and authority; institution and identity; interdiscursivity; marketization",,,,,,"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities

The article explores the ways that text and verbal talk are organized by the participants as inter-connecting modes of interaction. Focusing on Initiation, Response and Feedback sequences as an example of a form of exchange, the article shows that the interaction was comparatively disorderly where conducted across talk and text modes. For instance, written responses to questions or to encouragement turns often overlapped with verbal answers from other students or with encouragement turns from the tutor.

Two of these are the widely discussed community of practice and the lesser known micro-community of knowledge. Within such organizational communities collegial relationships are formed and maintained, norms and expectations learned, experiences shared, and ideas articulated and developed. The quality of collegial relations fostered by such communities, together with the importance of productive dialogue, have been identified as key components in organizations with the capability for ongoing innovation. Although communities of practice have long been recognized as contexts for both learning and the development of collegial relations, little attention has been paid to micro-communities of knowledge. Using examples from a micro-community of knowledge found in a small New Zealand-based IT company, I demonstrate the ways in which participants ‘do collegiality’ towards establishing relational engagement. An example of collegial interaction in a community of practice is provided by way of contrast. The article concludes by arguing that despite being two distinct interactional contexts, the repertoire of relational skills required and the potential for social learning through participation in these two kinds of communities renders them not only complementary, but tightly interdependent. © The Author(s) 2014.","Collegiality; community-of-practice; discourse; knowledge enabling context; micro-community of knowledge; quality of relationships; rapport management; relational engagement; self-distanciation",,,,,,,,,"Angouri, J., (2007) Language in the workplace: A multi-method study of communicative activity in seven multinational companies situated in Europe, , PhD thesis, University of Essex; Angouri, J., Tseliga, T., ‘YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHAT YOU’RE TALKING ABOUT!’: From e-disagreement to impoliteness in two online fora (2010) Journal of Politeness Research, 6, pp. 57-82; Brown, J.S., Duguid, P., Organizational learning and communities-of-practice: Toward a unified view of working, learning and innovation (1991) Organization Science, 2 (1), pp. 40-57; Brown, J.S., Duguid, P., Organizing knowledge (1998) California Management Review, 40 (3), pp. 90-111; Brown, J.S., Duguid, P., Balancing act: How to capture knowledge without killing it (2000) Harvard Business Review, 78 (3), pp. 73-80; Brown, P., Levinson, S.C., (1987) Some Universals in Language Usage, , Cambridge: Cambridge University Press; Bucholtz, M., ‘Why be normal?’: Language and identity practices in a community of nerd girls (1999) Language & Society, 28 (2), pp. 203-223; Carlile, P.R., Transferring, translating and transforming: An integrative framework for managing knowledge across boundaries (2004) Organization Science, 15 (5), pp. 555-568; Cook, S., Brown, J.S., Bridging epistemologies: The generative dance between organizational knowledge and organizational knowing (1999) Organization Science, 10 (4), pp. 381-400; Eckert, P., McConnell-Ginet, S., Think practically and look locally: Language and gender as community-based practice (1992) Annual Review of Anthropology, 21; Eelen, G., (2001) A Critique of Politeness Theories, , Manchester: St Jerome’s Press; Fletcher, J.K., (1999) Disappearing Acts: Gender Power and Relational Practice, , Cambridge, MA: MIT Press; Franziskus, A., (2013) Getting by in a multilingual workplace: Language practices, norms and ideologies of cross-border workers in Luxembourg, , PhD thesis, University of Luxembourg; Goffman, E., (1959) The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life, , Edinburgh: The University of Edinburgh Social Sciences Research Centre: Anchor Books; Goffman, E., (1967) Interaction Ritual, , New York: Doubleday Anchor; Grover, V., Davenport, T.H., General perspectives on knowledge management: Fostering a research agenda (2001) Journal of Management Information Systems, 18 (1), pp. 5-21; Holmes, J., (1995) Women, Men and Politeness, , London: Longman; Holmes, J., (2001) Introduction to Sociolinguistics, , 2001, 2nd edn.Harlow: Pearson.Harlow: Pearson; Holmes, J., Politeness, power and provocation: How humour functions in the workplace (2000) Discourse Studies, 2 (2), pp. 159-185; Holmes, J., Socio-pragmatic aspects of workplace talk The First International Conference on Linguistic Informatics: State of the Art and the Future, , 2004Tokyo University of Foreign Studies; 2004; Holmes, J., (2006) Gendered Talk at Work, , London: Blackwell; Holmes, J., Marra, M., Having a laugh at work: How humour contributes to workplace culture (2002) Journal of Pragmatics, 34, pp. 1683-1710; Holmes, J., Meyerhoff, M., The community of practice: Theories and methodologies in language and gender research (1999) Language in Society, 28, pp. 173-183; Holmes, J., Stubbe, M., (2003) The Handbook of Language and Gender, pp. 573-599. , Holmes JMeyerhoff M, ed.

Consequently, corporate branding has become more focused on associating and imbuing corporate brands with supposedly positive values and attributes. This article locates this emphasis in the context of Singapore’s marketized higher education sector, and examines how conceptual values like flexibility, freedom and empowerment are expressed linguistically and, more significantly, symbolized in and through photographic images in corporate brand communication. It is argued that while the circulation of conceptual values in branding has arisen in part due to the imperatives of branding, the privileging of values like flexibility, freedom and empowerment is symptomatic of neoliberal capitalist influence and the subjection of higher education in Singapore to a knowledge-based economic logic. This helps to shape stakeholders’ concepts and expectations of higher education as well as public attitudes towards the neoliberal knowledge-based market system more broadly. © The Author(s) 2014.","Corporate branding; critical discourse analysis; knowledge economy; metaphor; multimodality; neoliberal capitalism; photographic images; semiotics; Singapore higher education",,,,,,,,,"Aaker, J.L., Dimensions of brand personality (1997) Journal of Marketing Research, 34 (3), pp. 347-356; (2013) Values & Culture, , www.aimco.com/values-culture, (accessed June 2013); Askegaard, S., (2006) Brand Culture, pp. 91-102. , Schroeder JESalzer-Mörling M, ed.

Not only that, but they seem to have the habit of ordering us around. This aspect of TV ads has often been commented on by experts and laypersons alike. Therefore, we decided to tackle this issue and look at the prototypical expression of directives, that is, imperatives in voice-overs in television commercials. To this end we have carried out an empirical analysis of imperatives in voice-overs in the MATVA corpus (Multimodal Analysis of TV Ads) which contains transcriptions of nearly 800 voice-overs in British TV ads recorded on six days during 2009, 2010 and 2011. We provide an exhaustive quantitative and qualitative profile of imperatives in contemporary TV advertising. This includes information on the distribution of imperatives, the most common verbs in imperative clauses, and their discourse function. We are also able to show conclusively that the directive force of imperatives in TV ads is more akin to advice or recommendation than commands, and explain from a discourse-pragmatic perspective why this is so. © The Author(s) 2014.","Advertising; corpus analysis; directives; discourse; engagement; imperatives; persuasion; pragmatics; television",,,,,,,,,"Anthony, L., (2007) AntConc 3.2.1w (Windows), , Tokyo, Japan: Waseda University; Barron, A., (2012) Public Information Messages: A Contrastive Genre Analysis of State–Citizen Communication, , Amsterdam: John Benjamins; Biber, D., Johansson, S., Leech, G., (1999) Longman Grammar of Spoken and Written English, , Harlow: Pearson; Blum-Kulka, S., Indirectness and politeness in requests: Same or different (1987) Journal of Pragmatics, 11, pp. 131-146; Bowker, L., Towards a methodology for a corpus-based approach to translation evaluation (2001) Meta: Translators’ Journal, 46 (2), pp. 345-364; Brierley, S., (2000) The Advertising Handbook, , London: Routledge; Brown, P., Levinson, S., (1978) Politeness: Some Universals in Language Usage, , Cambridge: Cambridge University Press; Byrne, B., Relevance Theory and the Language of Advertising (1992) Trinity College Dublin, CLCS Occasional Paper, p. 31; Coltrane, S., Adams, M., Work–family imagery and gender stereotypes: Television and the reproduction of difference (1997) Journal of Vocational Behaviour, 50, pp. 323-347; Condoravdi, C., Lauer, S., (2012) Empirical Issues in Syntax and Semantics, pp. 37-58. , Piñon C, ed; Downing, A., Locke, P., (2006) English Grammar: A University Course, , London: Routledge; Downs, A.C., Harrison, S.K., Embarrassing age spots or just plain ugly?

Drawing upon the appraisal systems of attitude and engagement, this article examines how the reportage has changed over time in terms of the type and source of attitude. Through a comparative analysis of the news reports and editorials in the latest and back issues of the official English-language newspaper China Daily, this article identifies two major attitudinal shifts: 1) from an absence of inscribed attitude representing air quality as something natural to negative judgement of social sanction judging foreign embassies’ monitoring; 2) from judgement to three interwoven strands of appreciation, with the air quality, Western experience and prospective opportunities evaluated by both Chinese and international communities. When reporting and commenting on environmental issues of global concern, the national media voice may seek to achieve attitudinal consensus with the international community while adhering to the official discourse. © The Author(s) 2014.","Air pollution; appraisal; attitude; China; China Daily; editorial; engagement; globalization; news report; newspapers; quoted utterances",,,,,,"Ministry of Education, MOE: 11YJC740015

From the perspective of critical discourse analysis, Fairclough hypothesizes that university discourse will be colonized by business discourse. While a number of studies have been conducted, to my knowledge no study has compared university discourse and business discourse both synchronically and diachronically. This article compares how employer organizations are discursively constructed synchronically and diachronically in 240 academic and business job advertisements. The analytical frameworks are transitivity analysis and modality. The results indicate that academic job advertisements have changed from not mentioning organizations to discursively constructing organizations in a promotional manner like business job advertisements. In addition, universities reframe themselves as businesses, entrepreneurs and service providers. This article contends that universities should be selective in adopting business discourse and maintain their identity as educational institutions. © The Author(s) 2014.","Business discourse; critical discourse analysis; diachronic comparison; job advertisements; marketization of higher education; modality; synchronic comparison; transitivity; university",,,,,,"London Business School: B2010 2228, A2010 1/1575

A1971 14","The analysis of actions that employer organizations are construed as performing shows a clear change in the university advertisements, from a tendency to reticence in the 1970s to willingness in 2010 to construct themselves as influential, entrepreneurial and enthusiastic. This portrayal of employer organizations makes academic job advertisements in 2010 promotional and persuasive. Business job advertisements on the other hand show less change, having been self-promotional since the 1970s. There are seven types of actions that employer organizations are construed as performing. These are: Recruiting; Working; Promising work conditions; Financing; Developing/creating; Requiring; Urging contact; Others. Examples of each category are shown below. At the end of each example there is a code identifying the job advert from which the excerpt is taken, with ‘A’ standing for Academic and ‘B’ for Business. The first four digits are the year of the advertisement and the rest are the code used for each advertisement. Examples are drawn from all data sets wherever possible.

(A2010 202) It is apparent from these examples that three categories are inherently persuasive and promotional – promising work conditions, financing and developing/creating . When employer organizations are construed as offering a good work environment or career prospects, the job advertisements incentivize potential applicants to apply for a job. The financing category construes employer organizations as having abundant resources, thereby promoting the employer organizations while incentivizing potential applicants at the same time. The developing/creating category consists of words which construe employer organizations as growing or establishing themselves. The growth of an organization indicates its good prospects, financial strength and influence. This category is consequently self-promotional. Table 1 shows the frequency of each category across the four data sets to facilitate diachronic and synchronic comparisons. Here ‘A’ stands for academic job advertisements, whereas ‘B’ stands for business job advertisements. The numbers following ‘A’ and ‘B’ represent the year of job advertisements. Table 1. Frequency of actions which employers are construed as performing.

The use in the A2010 adverts of the promising work conditions and developing/creating categories, which are inherently promotional, shows that academic job advertisements have become more promotional and aligned themselves with business job advertisements. Other categories of actions which show the alignment of university discourse with business discourse, namely, recruiting, working and requiring , do not seem inherently promotional on the surface. However, an investigation of the linguistic features within these categories indicates an attempt to appeal to potential applicants.

A critical discourse analysis of The Daily Yomiuri reveals that Japanese national identity and the ideology of technoscience are reproduced through two discursive constructions: a diminished 'risk' from Fukushima radiation and citizens' national duty in the nuclear crisis. Within these two constructions, 11 major techniques are identified by which The Yomiuri discursively mitigates the risks from Fukushima and calls Japanese national identity into the service of the nuclear industry. The article concludes with implications for understanding the impact of political discourse in mass media on other policy debates in Japan and elsewhere. © The Author(s) 2013.","Critical discourse analysis; Fukushima; Great East Japan Earthquake; high reliability organization; Japan; legitimization; mass media; national identity; news in the press; nuclear power; representation; technoscience; Tohoku earthquake; Yomiuri",,,,,,"University of Hong Kong, HKU: 201107170198","This work was supported by The University of Hong Kong (grant number 201107170198).",,"Abe, Y., Why Safecast matters: A case study of collective risk assessment (2013) Forum on the 2011 Fukushima East Japan Disastert, , http://fukushimaforum.wordpress.com/, University of California at Berkeley, 11-14May.

In this study, forms of moral argumentation are seen as enthymemes, that is, claim-reason units based on moral norms as premises. The material consists of a total of 900 asynchronous online comments in English and 900 in Finnish. In addition to rhetorical argumentation analysis, the study investigates the dependency of moral argumentation on three contextual variables: gendered violence as the topic of discussion (domestic violence/female celebrities' fights), as the shared culture of participants (Finnish-speaking, 'national'/English-speaking, 'multicultural' participants) and a media institution as the moderator of online discourse (media-generated/user-generated websites). Four forms of moral argumentation were found in the material: 1) theoretical (deductive), 2) practical (contextual), 3) categorical (stereotype-based) and 4) digital ('crowding') enthymeme. Theoretical, practical and categorical enthymemes are rhetorical in a traditional sense because they include the hierarchical idea of moral norms as the shared, more or less authoritarian, basis of a community. Digital enthymemes, conversely, are texts without clear borders or any notion of moral norms. Such arguments characterized especially user-generated, English-language discussions concerning female celebrities' fights. This indicates that the digital enthymeme is particularly prevalent where there is a lack of obvious hierarchies in the context of argumentation. As this study argues, however, the seemingly non-hierarchical and individualistic participation through digital enthymemes is a mere illusion, for these enthymemes are based on crowd behaviour supportive of sexist and class-bound domination. © The Author(s) 2013.","Argumentation; context; enthymeme; internet; morality; popular culture",,,,,,,"This research has received funding from Viestintäalan tutkimussäätiö which made it possible to conduct this study during a visit in North Carolina State University.",,"The Internet Classics Archive, , http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/rhetoric.html, Aristotle (1994-2009/ 350 BC) Rhetoric (trans.

Drawing on data from ethnographic field notes, audio-recorded interactions and interviews involving one NP and 20 patients, the article outlines ways in which the NP creates a sense of solidarity by lessening the social distance between herself and her patients. These attempts at solidarity do not correlate with what has been noted in previous studies of medical visits involving medical doctors (MDs) and may represent a difference in how both the NP and the patients view the NP as a mid-level provider. As NPs are taking on a more prominent role in the healthcare landscape, it is important to understand what the interactional norms are and how these may deviate from the norm set by MDs. © The Author(s) 2014.","Alignment; health communication; institutional power; solidarity",,,,,,,,,"Ainsworth-Vaughn, N., (1998) Claiming Power in Doctor-Patient Talk, , Oxford: Oxford University Press; (2010) Access to care and advanced practice nurses: A review of southern U.S. practice laws, pp. 1-8; Baratt, J., A case study of styles of patient self-presentation in the nurse practitioner primary health care consultation (2005) Primary Health Care Research and Development, 6, pp. 329-340; Barry, C., Stevenson, F., Britten, N., Giving voice to the lifeworld: More humane, more effective medical care?

During this time, the British press focused particularly on Spain, watching the potentially volatile political situation with interest, and documenting the negotiations between Spanish and European leaders. This article considers how this situation was reported in two British newspapers, The Guardian and The Independent, applying corpus linguistics techniques to identify salient aspects of the crisis and to detect patterns in language use that had an ideological dimension. The 2012 crisis emerges mainly as a political issue, and the reporting focuses on solutions rather than causes or effects. However, even though these two publications are not noted for Euroscepticism, they both show a strong tendency to group South European countries together within a negative frame, collectivizing them and establishing a dichotomy with Northern Europe. © The Author(s) 2014.","Corpus linguistics; discourse analysis; Eurozone crisis; financial reports; Spain",,,,,,"Ministerio de EconomÃ­a y Competitividad, MINECO","This research was carried out within the framework of the project: “Metadiscurso y lenguaje evaluativo: perspectivas teóricas y de análisis en el discurso periodístico”, funded by the Spanish Ministerio de Economía y Competitividad (ref.

Conversely, research on written text or writing rarely focuses on interaction. In this article, we examine repair in written discourse; specifically in online settings. The data corpus comprises one-to-one quasi-synchronous Facebook 'chat'. First, we show that, as in spoken interaction, repair happens. This basic observation supports conversation analytic arguments that features of talk, like repair and laughter, do not 'leak randomly' into interaction but are precision-timed and designed to accomplish action. Second, we report on two types of repair: visible repair which can be seen and oriented to by both participants in the interaction, and message construction repair, which is available only to the message's writer. While the practice of message construction repair is made possible through the affordances of the online medium, it nevertheless shows how participants in written interaction are oriented to the same basic contingencies as they are in spoken talk: building sequentially organized courses of action and maintaining intersubjectivity. We suggest that assumptions about differences between spoken and online interaction are premature. Rather, we argue that online interaction should be treated as an adaptation of an oral speech-exchange system. © The Author(s) 2013.","Conversation analysis; Facebook; online; repair; screen-capture methods",,,,,,"Economic and Social Research Council, ESRC: ES/I903321/1","This work was supported by the Economic and Social Research Council (grant number: ES/I903321/1).",,"Antaki, C., Ardévol, E., Núñez, F., Vayreda, A., For she who knows who she is': Managing accountability in online forum messages (2005) Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication, 11 (1). , http://jcmc.indiana.edu/vol11/issue1/antaki.html, Available at;

The study focuses in particular on political interviews broadcast on 'morning show' type programmes. The analysis distinguishes the characteristics that make up the news interview turn-taking system in order to explore the degree to which information and entertainment come together in political interviews broadcast on morning shows. The results show, primarily, that political interviews shown on public service broadcasters' morning shows adhere to the journalistic standards of neutralism and adversarialness. This is precisely how they strive to make the politician publicly accountable. In political interviews broadcast by commercial broadcasters, however, these rules are followed intermittently. The aim of these interviews appears to be different: to penetrate politicians' personal sphere with the discernible purpose of entertaining. These differences reflect different interview styles which, in turn, reveal different conceptions of journalism, politics and society. This investigation utilizes the research tools developed in conversation analysis (CA). © The Author(s) 2013.","Broadcast political interviews; commercial broadcasting; conversation analysis; morning show; news interview; public service broadcasting",,,,,,"Ministerio de Ciencia e InnovaciÃ³n, MICINN: CS02008-02589/S0CI","This work was supported by Spain’s Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovación (grant number CS02008-02589/S0CI).",,"Antaki, C., Barnes, R., Leudar, I., Diagnostic formulations in psychotherapy (2005) Discourse Studies, 7 (6), pp. 627-647; Baum, M.A., Talking the vote: Why presidential candidates hit the talk show circuit (2005) American Journal of Political Science, 49 (2), pp. 213-234; Becker, A., (2007) Political Discourse in the Media, pp. 109-137. , Fetzer ALauerbach GE, ed.;, Amsterdam: John Benjamins; Blum-Kulka, S., The dynamics of political interviews (1983) Text, 3 (2), pp. 131-153; Cantavella, J., (2002) Historia De La Entrevista En Prensa, , Madrid: Editorial Universitas; Clayman, S.E., (1992) Talk at Work: Interaction in Institutional Settings, pp. 163-198. , Drew PHeritage J, ed.;, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press; Clayman, S.E., Disagreements and third parties: Dilemmas of neutralism in panel news interviews (2002) Journal of Pragmatics, 34 (10-11), pp. 1385-1401; Clayman, S.E., Address terms in the service of other actions: The case of news interview talk (2010) Discourse & Communication, 4 (2), pp. 161-183; Clayman, S.E., Heritage, J., (2002) The News Interview: Journalists and Public Figures on the Air, , Cambridge: Cambridge University Press; Llibre d'estil de la CCMA, , http://www.ccma.cat/llibredestil/manuals-destil/entrevistes, Corporació Catalana de Mitjans Audiovisuals (CCMA) (n.d.)

Adapting conversation analysis for the study of textual interactions, the research observes the linguistic means used by interlocutors to signal attention, interest, and agreement - these being identified as important constituents of contact. The corpus comprises 60 chats, collected from 20 participants who chat in a mixture of English and Indian languages such as Marathi and Hindi. Openings, middles, and closings of these interactions are analyzed to study the ways in which participants establish, maintain, and terminate contact. The use of various linguistic means in these interactions such as back-channels, evaluations, expressives, and questions draws attention to a significant amount of interactional work done by interlocutors towards maintaining contact. © The Author(s) 2013.","Bronislaw Malinowski; chat; computer-mediated communication; conversational contact; instant messaging; phatic communion; Roman Jakobson",,,,,,"Indian Institute of Technology Delhi, IIITD","I would also like to acknowledge the financial assistance I received from the Indian Institute of Technology Delhi.",,"Beisswenger, M., Situated chat analysis as a window to the user's perspective: Aspects of temporal and sequential organization (2008) Language@Internet, 5; Candlin, C.N., (2000) Small Talk, pp. xiii-xixx. , Coupland J, ed.;, Harlow: Pearson Education; Cheepen, C., (1988) The Predictability of Informal Conversation, , London: Pinter; Cheepen, C., (2000) Small Talk, pp. 287-311. , Coupland J, ed.;, Harlow: Pearson Education; Coupland, J., Coupland, N., Robinson, J., How are you?'

A discursive psychological analysis of expert board meetings shows that experts invoke various forms of reported dialogue/thoughts and dispositional statements when problems with technology and with program funding are discussed. Forms of reported dialogue serve to demonstrate that experts engage in dialogue with users, understand and are reasonable about users' concerns, and that the content of user concerns does not agree with expert views.

Data for the study comprised 60 full-page newspaper election campaign adverts of the two strongest political parties in the country: the People's Democratic Party (PDP) and Action Congress of Nigeria (ACN) published between February and April 2011, a period that can be referred to as the peak period of electioneering campaigns for the 2011 elections in Nigeria. The data gathered were analysed using the analytical tools of critical discourse analysis, with emphasis on Fairclough's discourse as a social practice approach to the theory. Findings reveal that the text producers employed discursive strategies such as the metaphorization of party symbols, the use of deictic pronouns for inclusion and exclusion, deployment of rhetorical questions for persuasion, identification with the youth culture, employment of historical allusions, giving appeal to good luck, and negative other representation. In addition, the packaging of the information, graphological foregrounding, imagery, repetition and lexical choice reveal the intent of the campaign advertiser to persuade, appeal to sentiments, legitimize and delegitimize their positions in the discourse. © The Author(s) 2013.","Advertising;

Based on the results, the need for and possibility of drawing genre boundaries between texts with different genre labels is discussed. The study is based on four communication strategy texts from two Finnish insurance companies. Communication strategy texts, such as communication strategies, policies and plans, are used in organizations to regulate the corporate communication function. The analysis is based on genre theory and the model of intertextual analysis presented by Charles Bazerman. The results indicate that the intertextual profile of the texts studied is relatively uniform, whereas the interdiscursive profile tends to vary according to the company and the intended audience. The texts studied form overlapping combinations of genres with multiple communicative purposes, which reflects the somewhat labile character of strategy texts in general. © The Author(s) 2013.","Bazerman; communication policy; communication strategy; communication strategy texts; corporate communication; disclosure policy; discourse analysis; genre; genre analysis; genre system; interdiscursivity; intertextuality",,,,,,"Alfred Kordelinin SÃ¤Ã¤tiÃ¶","This research has received funding from Alfred Kordelin foundation.",,"Bakhtin, M., (1981) The Dialogic Imagination, , Austin: University of Texas Press; Bazerman, C., (1994) Genre and New Rhetoric, pp. 79-101. , Freedman AMedway P, ed., London: Taylor and Francis; Bazerman, C., (2004) What Writing Does and How It Does It: An Introduction to Analyzing Texts and Textual Practices, pp. 83-96. , Bazerman CPrior P, ed., Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates; Bhatia, V.K., (2004) Worlds of Written Discourse, , London: Continuum; Bhatia, V.K., Interdiscursivity in professional communication (2010) Discourse & Communication, 4 (1), pp. 32-50; Caballero, R., Theorizing about genre and cybergenre (2008) CORELL: Computer Resources for Language Learning, 2, pp. 14-27; Cornelissen, J., (2011) Corporate Communication: A Guide to Theory and Practice, , 2011) Corporate Communication: A Guide to Theory and Practice, 3rd edn.Los Angeles, CA: SAGE.;, Los Angeles, CA: SAGE; Cornut, F., Giroux, H., Langley, A., The strategic plan as a genre (2012) Discourse & Communication, 6 (1), pp. 21-54; Devitt, A., (1991) Textual Dynamics of the Professions, pp. 336-355. , Bazerman CParadis J, ed., Madison: University of Wisconsin Press; Fairclough, N., (1992) Discourse and Social Change, , Cambridge: Polity Press; Fairclough, N., (1995) Media Discourse, , London and New York: Arnold; Fairclough, N., (2003) Analysing Discourse: Textual Analysis for Social Research, , London and New York: Routledge/Taylor & Francis Group; (2013) Disclosure Obligation, , http://www.finanssivalvonta.fi/en/Listed_companies/Disclosure_obligation/Pages/Default.aspx, Financial Supervisory Authority (FSA), (accessed 18 March 2013); Garzone, G., (2012) Genre Change in the Contemporary World: Short-Term Diachronic Perspectives, pp. 21-40. , Garzone GCatenaccio PDegano C, ed., Bern: Peter Lang; Gilsdorf, J.W., Written corporate communication policy: Extent, coverage, costs, benefits (1987) Journal of Business Communication, 24 (4), pp. 35-52; Greckhamer, T., The stretch of strategic management discourse: A critical analysis (2010) Organization Studies, 31 (7), pp. 841-871; Griffig, T., (2006) Intertextualität in Linguistischen Fachaufsätzen Des Englischen Und Deutschen, , Frankfurt am Main: Peter Lang; Grove Ditlevsen, M., Kastberg, P., When corporate communication goes public: Communication policies in public communication (2007) Hermes - Journal of Language and Communication Studies, 38, pp. 11-40; Johnson, G., Scholes, K., (1993) Exploring Corporate Strategy, , 3rd edn.New York: Prentice Hall; Koskela, M., (2008) Valtionhallinnon tekstilajiketjujen intertekstuaalisuuden piirteitä, , Erikoiskielet, käännösteoria ja monikielisyys.

Both the expressed and omitted variants of the subject will be considered, even if omission is by far the more frequent choice in Spanish and the more communicatively versatile one. The particularly vague reference of omitted nosotros 'we' - always involving an extension of the self towards a wider notional scope - results in a remarkable variety of possible contextual projections. It can be used to signal speaker identities as well as manage interpersonal relationships through the iconic suggestion of viewpoint coincidence. First-person plural clauses are quantitatively and qualitatively investigated across two corpora of contemporary Spanish comprising a variety of spoken and written genres. It is found that, aside from the basic distinction between hearer-exclusive and hearer-inclusive first persons, a third, intermediate variant can be considered, that of empathic hearer-exclusive uses. These are typical of interactions where involvement of the audience is sought even if they are not referentially included in the subject, as is usual in some varieties of spoken mass-media discourse. Each one of the referential variants is used with different frequencies and contextual repercussions, depending on the socio-functional demands and goals of particular textual genres. © The Author(s) 2013.","Mass media; nosotros; plural first person; pronouns; style; subject; variation",,,,,,"Universidad de Salamanca, USAL: FS/3-2012

This article explores the potential of an interactive blog about asylum-seekers to serve as part of the Habermasian 'public sphere', facilitating debate between those with opposing views. We offer evidence that pro- and anti-asylum seeker arguments made in blogs construct a binary between those in favour and those against. Arguments are collectively constructed producing relatively coherent discourses, despite being articulated by different individuals. We then explore the ways in which pro-asylum seeker postings utilize strategies which social scientists have identified as effective in challenging racism. As such, the blog is a site where what has come to be called 'bystander anti-racism' is being practised, producing a counter-hegemonic discourse. Our evidence suggests that despite arguments to the contrary, blogs are potentially useful sites for the development of communicative consciousness in relation to race issues, particularly the challenging of racism. © The Author(s) 2013.","Asylum seeker; Australia; blog; bystander anti-racism; counter-hegemony; discourse analysis; public sphere",,,,,,"Australian Research Council, ARC: FT100100432","This research received no specific grant from any funding agency in the public, commercial or not-for-profit sectors.

Thus, the blog-as-diary approach has shown its limitations. Viewing blogs as a genre is also misleading, as it confuses medium and genre. Considering that the studies of blog genres still need further theoretical and empirical investigations, we propose a method to assess blog posts, understood as utterances, the minimal unit of a blog. We then conduct an analysis of two large datasets from 100 Brazilian blogs. Three reviewers read and judged 5218 posts from 50 A-list blogs and 1527 posts from 50 non-A-list blogs, captured in a 30-day period. Posts' compositional form, theme and style were cross-analyzed in and between datasets. Our findings lead to the conclusion that blogs in the A-list group tend to post more and stick to themes that attract audiences. Non-A-list blogs post less and focus on themes of interest to bloggers themselves, not necessarily hype topics. © The Author(s) 2013.","Blog; compositional form; genre; style; theme; utterance",,,,,,"Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento CientÃ­fico e TecnolÃ³gico, CNPq: 483173/2010-0

A corpus of 10 episodes of News Simulcast was selected as the database, from which a subset of four episodes were thoroughly examined from the macro-level of discoursal and thematic structure to the micro-level of linguistic and semiotic structure. It demonstrates that, due to its historic background and political privilege, News Simulcast broadcasts news with an authoritative national voice, speaking primarily in the interests of the Communist Party, the government and the people, and it thus forms a rather stereotyped discourse structure: positive 'us' versus negative 'them'. © The Author(s) 2013.","Discourse structure; ideology; national voice; news; News Simulcast",,,,,,"Universidade de Macau, UM","This article is part of my PhD research project supported by the University of Macau.

The discourse analysis presented in this study shows that in their official online biographies, that is, as given on websites provided by the US government, congresswomen devoted more space to describing their own personal traits than did congressmen. In particular, women tended to stress the masculine aspects of their personalities by using so-called masculine words such as tough and fighter much more than their male counterparts did. Such masculine terminology was scarcely evident in the biographies of male House members in the same states and committees as the female members. These findings imply that female politicians are more active in strategically presenting themselves as tough leaders in what appears to be a self-conscious effort to counteract detrimental gender stereotypes. © The Author(s) 2013.","Biography; congresswoman; discourse; female politician; gender; Internet; language; masculine; politics; self-presentation; sex; stereotype; strategy; trait",,,,,,,,,"Banwart, M., (2004) The Internet Election, pp. 37-55. , Williams APTedesco J, ed.;, Lanham, MD: Rowman & Littlefield; Banwart, M., Gender and candidate communication: Effects of stereotypes in the 2008 election (2010) American Behavioral Scientist, 54 (3), pp. 265-283; Baxter, J., Survival or success?

Along with the technical skills entailed in learning a new job, apprentices need to acquire proficiency in appropriate ways of communicating in order to construct a convincing professional identity. Data collected on a New Zealand building site provides evidence of the extent of the situated learning in which building apprentices engage. Becoming an accepted member of the community of practice centrally involves learning to recognize and respond appropriately to a wide range of differently encoded directives, for instance. But membership also entails developing an understanding of more subtle interactional norms, such as acceptable topics of small talk and appropriate forms and quantities of humour on the job. This article examines evidence that suggests these understandings develop gradually as apprentices move from peripheral to core status in their chosen professional community of practice. We also explore the implications of the analysis for a more nuanced understanding of the complexities of the community of practice framework. © The Author(s) 2013.","Apprenticeship; building site; community of practice; directives; humour; workplace discourse",,,,,,"Victoria University of Wellington

Drawing on Bucholtz and Hall's (2005, 2006) framework of identity, and recent research on stance (e.g. Du Bois, 2007), it illustrates how metaphor marks attitudes and orientations to context, propositions and social and political structures/relationships. The analysis highlights similarities in the depiction of the organization over two terms of office, but also reveals differences in identity positioning and inter-subjective framing. Particular metaphorical scenarios and mappings are used rhetorically to strengthen subject positions and alignments, and mark evaluations, supporting Du Bois's theory of stance as a 'triune' act. It is argued that a combined analysis of stance and metaphor provides an important framework and instrument for further research on identity construction, especially in organizational and political discourse. Moreover, the theory of stance can be further enhanced through an investigation of metaphorical mappings. © The Author(s) 2013.","Identity; metaphor; metaphor analysis; myth-making; organizations; political discourse; speech-making; stance; United Nations",,,,,,,,,"Bourdieu, P., (1997) Language and Symbolic Power, , Oxford: Polity Press; Bucholtz, M., (2009) Stance: Sociolinguistic Perspectives, pp. 146-170. , Jaffe A, ed.;, Oxford: Oxford University Press, pp; Bucholtz, M., Hall, K., Identity and interaction: A sociocultural linguistic approach (2005) Discourse Studies, 7 (4-5), pp. 585-614; Bucholtz, M., Hall, K., (2006) A Companion to Linguistic Anthropology, pp. 369-394. , Duranti A, ed.;, Oxford: Blackwell, pp; Charteris-Black, J., (2006) Politicians and Rhetoric: The Persuasive Power of Metaphor, , New York: Palgrave Macmillan; Chilton, P., (1985) Language and the Nuclear Arms Debate: Nukespeak Today, , London: Pinter; Chilton, P., (1996) Security Metaphor: Cold War Discourse from Containment to Common House, , New York: Peter Lang; Chilton, P., (2006) Analysing Political Discourse: Theory and Practice, , London: Routledge; Chilton, P., Ilyin, M., Metaphor in political discourse: The case of the 'Common European House (1993) Discourse & Society, 4 (1), pp. 7-31; Chilton, P., Schäffner, C., (1997) Discourse as Social Interaction, pp. 206-230. , Van Dijk T, ed.;, London: SAGE; Chilton, P., Schäffner, C., (2002) Politics as Talk and Text: Analytical Approaches to Political Discourse, , Amsterdam: John Benjamins; Coupland, J., Coupland, N., (2009) Stance: Sociolinguistic Perspectives, , Jaffe A, ed.;, Oxford: Oxford University Press; du Bois, J., (2007) Stancetaking in Discourse, pp. 139-182. , Englebretson R, ed.;, Amsterdam: John Benjamins; Flood, C., (2002) Political Myth: A Theoretical Introduction, , New York and London: Routledge; Flowerdew, J., Leong, S., Metaphors in the discursive construction of patriotism: The case of Hong Kong's constitutional reform debate (2007) Discourse & Society, 18 (3), pp. 278-294; Goodwin, C., Participation, stance and affect in the organization of activities (2007) Discourse & Society, 18 (1), pp. 53-73; Grant, D., Oswick, C., (1996) Metaphor and Organizations, , Thousand Oaks, CA: SAGE; Hunston, S., Thompson, G., (2000) Evaluation in Text: Authorial Stance and the Construction of Discourse, , Oxford: Oxford University Press; Irvine, J., (2009) Stance: Sociolinguistic Perspectives, pp. 53-71. , Jaffe A, ed.;, Oxford: Oxford University Press; Jaffe, A., (2009) Stance: Sociolinguistic Perspectives, pp. 3-28. , Jaffe A, ed.;, Oxford: Oxford University Press; Jaffe, A., (2009) Stance: Sociolinguistic Perspectives, pp. 119-145. , Jaffe A, ed.;, Oxford: Oxford University Press; Jaffe, A., (2009) Stance: Sociolinguistic Perspectives, , Oxford: Oxford University Press; Jaworski, A., Thurlow, C., (2009) Stance: Sociolinguistic Perspectives, pp. 195-226. , Jaffe A, ed.;, Oxford: Oxford University Press; Kiesling, S., Dude (2004) American Speech, 79 (3), pp. 281-305; Kiesling, S., (2009) Stance: Sociolinguistic Perspectives, pp. 171-194. , Jaffe A, ed.;, Oxford: Oxford University Press; Kövesces, Z., (2010) Metaphor: A Practical Introduction, , Oxford: Oxford University Press; Lakoff, G., (1987) Women, Fire, and Dangerous Things: What Categories Reveal about the Mind, , Chicago, IL: University of Chicago Press; Lakoff, G., The invariance hypothesis: Is abstract reason based on image-schema?

While in previous research these features have been seen as signs for a new, popular feminism, more recently they have also been connected to the growing hegemony of neoliberal governance, a mode of power that ultimately aims at the economization of the social and is fundamentally exercised in and through discourse. The aim of this article is to investigate further the interconnectedness of these two phenomena, postfeminism and neoliberalism, in the domain of work, using the example of the German edition of Cosmopolitan. For a detailed and multilayered investigation the study draws on linguistically oriented discourse analysis, focusing on the operation of a 'discourse of postfeminist self-management'. The examination shows how this discourse, while on the one hand evoking an ethos of feminist engagement, on the other seeks to guide readers to mould themselves into a version of the entrepreneurial self required by the neoliberalized world of work. © The Author(s) 2013.","Discourse analysis; discourses; empowerment; gender; Germany; governmentality; neoliberalism; postfeminism; power; women's magazines",,,,,,"Academy of Finland","The article has been written in the context of the Peripheral Multilingualism research project ( www.peripheralmultilingualism.fi ), funded by the Academy of Finland.",,"Ballaster, R., Beetham, M., Frazer, E., Hebron, S., (1991) Women's Worlds: Ideology, Femininity and the Women's Magazine, , Basingstoke: Macmillan; Blommaert, J., (2005) Discourse: A Critical Introduction, , Cambridge: Cambridge University Press; (2010), http://www.bmfsfj.de/BMFSFJ/Service/Archiv/16-legislatur,did=88094.html, BMFSFJ Erwerbstätigkeit [BMFSFJ Employment] (n.d.)

Sensationalism is understood here as a discourse strategy of 'packaging' information in news headlines in such a way that news items are presented as more interesting, extraordinary and relevant than might be the case. Unlike previous content analyses of sensational coverage, this study demonstrates how sensationalism is instantiated through specific illocutions, semantic macrostructures, narrative formulas, evaluation parameters, and interpersonal and textual devices. Examples are drawn from a corpus of headlines of the 'most read' articles in the online outlet of the British mid-market tabloid Daily Mail compiled in early 2012. Sensationalized instances are identified through surveys and focus group discussions and subsequently analyzed quantitatively and qualitatively. The study is located within the context of media scholarship on news values and current trends in journalism. © The Author(s) 2013.","Attention; critical discourse analysis; Daily Mail; headlines; news discourse; newsworthiness; popular journalism; pragma-linguistics; sensationalism",,,,,,,,,"Allan, S., (2004) News Culture, , Maidenhead: Open University Press; Andrew, B., Media-generated shortcuts: Do newspaper headlines present another roadblock for low-information rationality?

However, past research focused mostly on dyadic host-caller interactions. Radio talk shows in Hong Kong, in contrast, often have more than one host. This study is interested in the implications of the triadic setting of radio talk shows in Hong Kong. It uses Radio Television Hong Kong's evening program Open Line Open View as a case study. Employing the techniques of conversation analysis, this study replicates some of past studies' findings about the source of host power. More importantly, the analysis shows that the second host in a triadic setting can play three important roles: the program conductor, the buffer, and the counterweight. The micro-level interactional patterns have important implications for the overall character of the program itself and the role of talk radio in the politics of public opinion in Hong Kong. More generally, this study illustrates the utility of paying attention to the differences between dyads and triads in the microsociological analysis of conversations in broadcast media. © The Author(s) 2013.","Conversation analysis; Hong Kong; host power; talk radio; triadic conversation",,,,,,,"The research reported in this study is supported by a General Research Fund offered by the Research Grant Council of the Hong Kong government to the second author (Project No. CUHK446409).",,"Clayman, S., Heritage, J., (2002) The News Interview: Journalists and Public Figures on the Air, , New York: Cambridge University Press; Čmejrková, S., Prevignano, C.L., (2003) Discussing Conversation Analysis: The Work of Emanuel A.

This study examines the cultural reproduction of that 'doing' through the onscreen discourse of the animated television sitcom. A conversation-analytic approach to various excerpts from two popular series reveals the ways in which the situated interactions of these programs make gender and sexuality overtly relevant to viewers through polarization of 'the norm' versus deviations from it at the level of talk. In temporarily deviating from their everyday, normative speech practices, characters tap into viewers' preconceived notions of the behaviors of different gendered and sexual identities in interaction. These non-normative actions are then oriented to as such in the onscreen discourse, thereby making gender, sexuality, and the conduct associated with those identities simultaneously salient for the at-home viewer. It is hypothesized that, while these gender-/sexuality-based associations can be used as a tool through which to offer critiques of the social stereotypes that they parody, they can also serve to re-create those hegemonic divisions at a discursive level through homogenization of the complex range of human identities being represented. © The Author(s) 2013.","Conversation analysis; discourse; gender; interaction; mass communication; methodology; norms; popular culture; sexuality; stereotyping; television",,,,,,,,,"American Dad!

'How do I look?' is therefore a salient question in terms of personal ageing. Dance makes bodies watchable, while ageing has been claimed to make bodies 'unwatchable'. Ethnographic research conducted amongst a group of older dancers provides an opportunity to study these ideological tensions empirically, by analysing the discursive representations of older dancers and their teacher. 'The mirror' is a productive theme in the data, giving access to understandings of (un)watchability of more and less literal sorts. It proves to be the case that, while dance as a practice for older women remains fitfully tainted by culturally dominant ageist assumptions about the body and ageing, it also opens up far more emancipating ideologies. Older dancers' articulation of these ideologies are suggestive of how embodied ageing can be reconstrued, well beyond dance contexts. © The Author(s) 2013.","Ageing; dance; ethnography; gender; identity;

I examine how an NBC News broadcast selected verbal-visual representations of the past in order to enact a context for an upcoming discourse moment: Colin Powell's 2003 United Nations (UN) address. The article draws on appraisal analysis (Martin and White, 2005), multimodal video analysis (Baldry and Thibault, 2005) and scholarship on the rhetoric of futurity (e.g. Dunmire, 2011). I show that the NBC journalists who precontextualized Powell's address on the night before its delivery presented viewers with a supportive context for understanding Powell's argument. By representing Saddam Hussein as deceptive and even deserving of future violence, the journalists essentially pre-confirmed arguments that Powell employed the next day. More importantly, because the news representations were presented as factual, they allowed viewers little space to consider alternative viewpoints - and little reason to question or resist the seemingly inexorable push for war. © The Author(s) 2013.","America; appraisal; attitude; Colin Powell; critical discourse analysis; engagement; future; graduation; intertextuality; Iraq War; legitimation; multimodality; NBC; precontextualization; recontextualization; television news",,,,,,,,,"(2007) On Rhetoric, , New York: Oxford University Press; Bakhtin, M.M., (1981) The Dialogic Imagination, , Austin: University of Texas; Baldry, A.P., Thibault, P.J., (2005) Multimodal Transcription and Text Analysis: A Multimodal Toolkit and Coursebook with Associated On-Line Course, , London: Equinox; Bauman, R., Briggs, C.L., Poetics and performance as critical perspectives on language and social life (1990) Annual Review of Anthropology, 19, pp. 59-88; (2003) Powell takes Iraq case to U.N., , http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/2727489.stm, BBC News, 5February.

Drawing on repair image theory (Benoit, 1997), narrative theory (Labov and Waletsky, 1967), and argumentation theory (Aristotle), this article aims to investigate which discursive strategies and which linguistic structures have been instrumental in this construction. Three analytical categories were investigated in this study, namely, image repair strategies, construction of ethos, and narratives. In each of these categories, special attention is paid to lexico-grammatical features (e.g. active voice/passive voice, grammatical metaphor, etc.) and socio-pragmatic strategies (e.g. redundancy). The analysis shows that the core image repair strategy is denial, which is accomplished through a highly rhetorical language. It also demonstrates how the public statements create a secondary narrative of the companies' good sense, good moral character, and goodwill, through the use and abuse of linguistic and pragmatic devices. © The Author(s) 2013.","Chile; crisis communication; ethos; image repair theory; primary narratives; public statements; secondary narratives",,,,,,,,,"Avery, E.J., Lariscy, R.W., Kim, S., Hocke, T., A quantitative review of crisis communication research in public relations from 1991 to 2009 (2010) Public Relations Review, 36, pp. 190-192; Banks, D., (2003) Grammatical Metaphor, pp. 127-147. , Simon-Vandenbergen A-MTaverniers MRavelli L, ed., Amsterdam: John Benjamins; Benoit, W.L., Image repair discourse and crisis communication (1997) Public Relations Review, 23 (2), pp. 177-186; Benoit, W.L., Brinson, S.L., AT&T: Apologies are not enough (1994) Communication Quarterly, 42, pp. 75-88; Bhatia, V.K., Genre analysis, ESP and professional practice (2008) English for Specific Purposes, 27, pp. 161-174; Brennan, E., An open letter to Sears' customers (1992) New York Times, pp. A56; Bruner, J., (2002) Making Stories: Law, Literature, Life, , New York: Farrar, Straus and Giroux; de Fina, A., Pronominal choice, identity, and solidarity in political discourse (1995) Text, 15 (3), pp. 379-410; de Raaf, D.I., (2000) Protecting Brands: How to Respond on Adverse Brand Publicity, , Tilburg: Van Spaenendonck Drukkerij; Fairclough, N., (1989) Language and Power, , Harlow: Longman; Fairclough, N., (1994) The Authority of the Consumer, pp. 253-268. , Keat RWhiteley NAbercrombie N, ed., London: Routledge; Fowler, R., (1991) Language in the News, , London: Routledge; Fowler, R., Hodge, B., Kress, G., Trew, T., (1979) Language and Social Control, , London: Routledge; Gilpin, D.R., Narrating the organizational self: Reframing the role of the news release (2008) Public Relations Review, 34 (1), pp. 9-18; Grice, H.P., (1975) The Philosophy of Language, pp. 171-181. , Martinich AP, ed., New York: Oxford University Press; Griffin, F., Merck's open letters and the teaching of ethos (2008) Business Communication Quarterly, 72 (1), pp. 61-72; Gutiérrez, R.M., (2008) Géneros Académicos Y Géneros Profesionales: Accesos Discursivos Para Saber Y Hacer, pp. 269-288. , Parodi G, ed., Valparaíso: Ediciones Universitarias; Halliday, M.A.K., (1993) The Language of Early Childhood, pp. 327-352. , Webster J, ed., London: Continuum; Halliday, M.A.K., (1997) The Language of Science, pp. 181-198. , Webster J, ed., London: Continuum; Halliday, M.A.K., Matthiessen, C., (2004) An Introduction to Functional Grammar, , London: Arnold; Jacobs, G., Self-reference in press releases (1999) Journal of Pragmatics, 31, pp. 219-242; Labov, W., Waletsky, J., (1967) Essays on the Verbal and Visual Arts, pp. 12-44. , Helm J, ed., Seattle: University of Washington Press; Lassen, I., (2003) Accessibility and Acceptability in Technical Manuals, , Amsterdam: John Benjamins; Lassen, I., Is the press release a genre?

The study is based on 46 interviews conducted with employees in three chemical factories, and combines Michel Foucault's conception of governmentality with a discursive psychology approach. The study demonstrates how dilemmas emerge when 1) respondents make others responsible for health and safety risks; 2) they personally assume responsibility as 'risky' workers; and 3) different rationalities - such as environmental and behavioural or hierarchical - appear in the same set of statements. Overall, occupational health and safety management tends to exclude egalitarian beliefs, which creates dilemmas that become visible as speakers find themselves compelled to excuse, ironize or systematically downplay discursive moves that may diminish or exclude themselves or others. Given that previous research suggests that behavioural approaches to health become increasingly widespread in working life, this article contributes by highlighting the presence of dilemmas that implies some flux and openness to change. © The Author(s) 2013.","Behaviour-based safety; chemical industry; collective prevention; dilemmas; discourse analysis; discursive psychology; Foucault; governmentality; individual prevention; naming; neoliberalism; organizational discourse; responsibilization; risk; safe design; Sweden; welfarism; workplace safety",,,,,,"Centre of Expertise in Energetic Materials, CEEM

The present study examines the 'rationality' of entrepreneurship policies by analyzing how actors in charge of the grassroots level policy implementation in the farming context use entrepreneurship discourse and argue for the communicative and interactive viability of their mission. The analysis of stances and positioning in interview talk reveals that policy implementers are active discourse users who, on the one hand, are able to reflect on the dilemmas and problems inherent in their task but, on the other hand, use their rhetorical agency to maintain and defend their mission as promoters of entrepreneurship policy and to save and support their own face as experts. As a result, the implementation emerges as a delicately managed interaction process. © The Author(s) 2013.","Agency; entrepreneurial governance; entrepreneurship discourse; expertise; farming; policy implementation; rhetorical social psychology",,,,,,,"The data used in this article were generated in a research project funded by the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry in Finland (Rural Policy Committee).",,"Armstrong, P., Styles of illusion (2001) Sociological Review, 49 (2), pp. 155-173; Audretsch, D.B., Beckmann, I.A.M., (2007) Handbook of Research on Entrepreneurship Policy, pp. 36-53. , Audretsch DBGrilo IThurik RA, ed., Cheltenham: Edward Elgar; Augoustinos, M., Walker, I., Donaghue, N., (2006) Social Cognition: An Integrated Introduction, , 2006) Social Cognition: An Integrated Introduction, 2nd edn.London: SAGE., London: SAGE; Bateson, G., Bateson, M.C., (1988) Angels Fear: Towards an Epistemology of the Sacred, , New York: Bantam; Billig, M., (1987) Arguing and Thinking: A Rhetorical Approach to Social Psychology, , Cambridge: Cambridge University Press; Billig, M., (1991) Ideology and Opinions: Studies in Rhetorical Social Psychology, , London: SAGE; Billig, M., MacMillan, K., Metaphor, idiom and ideology: The search for 'no smoking guns' across time (2005) Discourse & Society, 16, pp. 459-480; Billig, M., Condor, S., Edwards, D., (1988) Ideological Dilemmas: A Social Psychology of Everyday Thinking, , London: SAGE; Brehm, S.S., Brehm, J.W., (1981) Psychological Reactance: A Theory of Freedom and Control, , New York: Academic Press; Burchell, G., Gordon, C., Miller, P., (1991) The Foucault Effect: Studies in Governmentality, , London: Harvester Wheatsheaf; Burr, V., (1995) An Introduction to Social Constructionism, , London: Routledge; Chell, E., Social enterprise and entrepreneurship: Towards a convergent theory of the entrepreneurial process (2007) International Small Business Journal, 25, pp. 5-26; Curran, J., What is small business policy in the UK for?

Findings show that a variety of discursive strategies are adopted by the newspapers to construct national identity and intergroup relations, including: 1) the discursive categorization of group identity, 2) the discursive re-categorization of intergroup relations, and 3) the discursive re-categorization of intragroup relations. Even though both newspapers are products of globalization, and purport to target international and cosmopolitan audiences, the reporting of the East China Sea incident closely adheres to official narratives and discourses of the respective governments. © The Author(s) 2012.","China; critical discourse analysis; editorials; globalization; ideology; intergroup communication; Japan; national identity; newspapers; opinions",,,,,,,,,"Akhavan-Majid, R., Ramaprasad, J., Framing and ideology: A comparative analysis of U.S. and Chinese newspaper coverage of the Fourth United Nations Conference on Women and the NGO Forum (1998) Mass Communication and Society, 1 (3-4), pp. 131-152; Anderson, B., (1991) Imagined Communities, , London: Verso; Appadurai, A., (1996) Modernity at Large: Cultural Dimensions of Modernity, , Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press; Calder, K.E., China and Japan's simmering rivalry (2006) Foreign Affairs, 82 (2), pp. 129-139; de Cillia, R., Reisigl, M., Wodak, R., The discursive construction of national identities (1999) Discourse & Society, 10 (2), pp. 149-173; de Fina, A., Schiffrin, D., Bamberg, M., (2006) Discourse and Identity, , Cambridge: Cambridge University Press; Entman, R.M., Framing: Toward clarification of a fractured paradigm (1993) Journal of Communication, 43, pp. 51-58; Gaertner, S.L., Dovidio, J.F., Anastasio, P.A., The common ingroup identity model: Recategorization and the reduction of intergroup bias (1993) European Review of Social Psychology, 4, pp. 1-26; Halbwachs, M., (1992) On Collective Memory, , Chicago, IL: University of Chicago Press; Hall, S., The problem of ideology: Marxism without guarantees (1986) Journal of Communication Inquiry, 10 (2), pp. 28-44; He, Y., History, Chinese nationalism and the emerging Sino-Japanese conflict (2007) Journal of Contemporary China, 16, pp. 1-24; Hsiung, J.C., (2007) China and Japan at Odds: Deciphering the Perpetual Conflict, pp. 1-22. , Hsiung JC, ed., New York: Palgrave Macmillan; Hutcheson, J., Domke, D., Billeaudeaux, A., Garland, P., U.S. national identity, political elites, and a patriotic press following September 11 (2004) Political Communication, 21, pp. 27-50; Izadi, F., Saghaye-Biria, H., A discourse analysis of elite American newspaper editorials: The case of Iran's nuclear program (2007) Journal of Communication Inquiry, 31 (2), pp. 140-165; Koh, Y., Japanese tourism to China tapers off (2010) Wall Street Journal, , http://blogs.wsj.com/japanrealtime/2010/10/18/japanese-tourism-to-china-tapers-off, 18October.

Mediaset is the largest commercial broadcaster in the country and is owned by former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi. By drawing on critical discourse analysis of broadcast news, it is argued that linguistic elements such as pronouns, choice of words, and metaphors, together with tendentious editing and framing of interviews, were part of a strategy of positive representation of the broadcaster's interests in the transition and negative representation of media policies opposing such interests. In particular, the analysis brings to the surface the ideological usage of interviews. Interviews in this case did not function as an act of control over the powerful, but as a way to illuminate the broadcaster's strategic interests while obfuscating the reasons behind attempts to regulate the transition to digital television and open the market to competition. The data attest that the way in which news programs covered the digital transition exposes the connections between media content, media ownership, and governmental institutions. Indeed, all three news programs, TG5, TG4, and Studio Aperto, despite their different target audience and the reputation of one of them (TG5) as the most objective and authoritative newscast on Italian commercial television, echoed each other in unified support of the sort of interests and media legislation that best fitted the corporation, especially at times when those interests were threatened. The corpus consists of 13 newscasts grouped in two clusters aired in 2006 and 2009. The main participants in the story were Mediaset's president, often interviewed as the 'expert' on the TV industry, the communications minister for the center-left Prodi government (in the 2006 cluster), and the communications undersecretary for the center-right Berlusconi government (in the 2009 cluster). Citizens and consumer groups were never given the opportunity to voice their positions or be an active part of the narration. © The Author(s) 2012.","Broadcast news; digital television; discourse analysis; Italian media; media legislation; news interviews",,,,,,,,,"Baaren, B., More pixels, less vision: The politics of HDTV in the Netherlands (2011) Paper delivered at the International Communication Association conference, , Boston, MA; Baym, G., Constructing moral authority: We in the discourse of television news (2000) Western Journal of Communication, 64 (1), pp. 92-111; Boxer, D., The news interview on morning television: A sociolinguistic analysis (1988) Working Papers in Educational Linguistics, 4 (1), pp. 101-116; Brown, A., Picard, R., (2005) Digital Terrestrial Television in Europe, , London: Routledge; Colombo, F., (2007) La Digitalizzazione Dei Media, , Rome: Carocci; D'Arma, A., (2010) Beyond Monopoly Globalization and the Media in Italy, pp. 3-20. , Ardizzoni MFerrari C, ed., Lanham, MD: Rowman & Littlefield; Davidson, R., Schejter, A., Their deeds are the deeds of Zimri; but they expect a reward like Phineas': Neoliberal and multiculural discourses in the development of Israeli DTT policy (2011) Communication, Culture & Critique, 4, pp. 1-22; de Sola Pool, I., (1983) Technologies of Freedom, , Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press; Ekström, M., Politicians interviewed on television news (2001) Discourse & Society, 12 (5), pp. 563-584; Fairclough, N., (2001) Language and Power, , London: Longman; Fairclough, N., (2006) Media Studies: A Reader, pp. 308-325. , Marris PThornham S, ed., New York: New York University Press; Galperin, H., (2004) New Television, Old Politics: The Transition to Digital TV in the United States and Britain, , Cambridge: Cambridge University Press; (2012) Norme di principio in materia di assetto del sistema radiotelevisivo e della RAI-Radiotelevisione italiana S.p.a, , www.comunicazioni.it/it/index.php?IdPag=836, Gasparri Law 3 May 2004, n. 112, Available at, (accessed 4 April); Garnham, N., Public service versus the market (1983) Screen, 24 (1), pp. 6-27; (1976) Bad News, , London: Routledge; (1982) Really Bad News, , London: Writers and Readers Co-operative; Hallin, D., (1994) We Keep America on Top of the World, , London: Routledge; (2006) Disegno di Legge Gentiloni: L'Impatto sul Mercato Televisivo (Gentiloni Bill: The Impact on the Television Market), , http://www.primaonline.it/wp-content/plugins/Flutter/files_flutter/1229957351file15027639930792.pdf, IT Media, Rome, 30October.

In Spain, for instance, the private domain has gradually invaded the public domain in an attempt to increase audience ratings and also reflect patterns of asymmetrical societal organization (García-Gómez, 2009). Different television formats, which range from docusoaps to the most blatant examples of so-called 'voyeur television' (Higgins, 2009), have occupied the prime-time hours. In particular, a wide range of reality television shows has taken the place that mini-series, sitcoms and films of the week used to occupy. These reality television programmes show the transformation of the private domain into one which can be manipulated and incorporated as an essential element in the theatricalization of the intimate experiences of anonymous people (Myers, 2001). By addressing the relationship between mothering and gendered styles, this study adds to the field of research on reality television research by investigating language and gender within the institutional setting of a docusoap and throwing light on the discursive strategies which two different generations of women use to express anger and assertiveness and impose on others. The study reveals that the strategies used by the Spanish female teenagers under scrutiny are associated with hostile laddish verbal behaviour, whereas the mothers' strategies relate to an instrumental view of aggression. © The Author(s) 2012.","Femininity; gendered discourses; linguistic strategies; reality television; verbal conflict",,,,,,"Ministerio de Ciencia e InnovaciÃ³n, MICINN","The present study was financially supported by a grant (ID No: FFI2009-7308) from the Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovación.

Drawing on recent work in critical discourse analysis of text and visual design, the article uses multimodal discourse analysis and draws from Halliday's Systemic Functional Grammar's transitivity analysis to analyze family planning pamphlets, focusing on the discursive construction of women as contraceptive users. The article argues that the salience of the language of risk and vulnerability, which is textually and visually deployed throughout the pamphlets, discursively constructs risk as a feature of unequal power relations. The article further argues that underlying the overarching discourse on risk are multiple 'silences' that discursively construct an ideological difference consisting of oppositional binaries between 'us' and 'them' in terms of power relations. The differentiation of social groups reflects 'hidden' social inequalities in the text and visual images. © The Author(s) 2012.","Critical discourse analysis; difference; discourse of silence; family planning; marginalization; multimodality; risk; vulnerability",,,,,,,,,"Armstrong, D., Public health spaces and the fabrication of identity (1993) Sociology, 27 (3), pp. 340-393; Armstrong, D., (1998) Reassessing Foucault: Power, Medicine and the Body, pp. 17-27. , Jones CPorter R, ed., London: Routledge; Bell, A., Language style as audience design (1984) Language in Society, 13 (2), pp. 145-204; Bradbury, J., The policy implications of differing concepts of risk (1989) Science, Technology and Human Values, 14 (4), pp. 380-399; Byrman, G., From marital precautions to love power: Gender construction in Swedish contraceptive brochures (2001) Nordic Journal of Women's Studies, 9 (2), pp. 89-97; Carabine, J., (2001) Discourse as Data: A Guide for Analysis, pp. 267-307. , Wetherell MTaylor SYates SJ, ed., London: SAGE; Fairclough, N., (1992) Discourse and Social Change, , Cambridge: Polity; Fairclough, N., (2001) Discourse as Data, pp. 229-266. , Wetherell MTaylor SYates SJ, ed., London: SAGE; Fiske, J., Browne, A.J., Aboriginal citizens, discredited medical subject: Paradoxical constructions of subjectivity in health care policies (2006) Policy Sciences, 39 (1), pp. 91-111; Foucault, M., (1978) The History of Sexuality: An Introduction, , New York: Pantheon; Foucault, M., (1980) Power/Knowledge: Selected Interviews and Other Writings, 1972-1977, , New York: Pantheon; Greco, M., Psychosomatic subjects and the 'duty to be well': Personal agency within medical rationality (1993) Economy and Society, 22 (3), pp. 357-372; Hall, S., (1989) Rethinking Communication: Paradigm Exemplars, pp. 40-52. , Dervin BGrossberg LO'Keefe BWartella E, ed., London: SAGE; Halliday, M.A.K., (1994) An Introduction to Functional Grammar, , 2nd edn.London: Arnold., London: Arnold; Halliday, M.A.K., Matthiessen, C.M.I.M., (2004) An Introduction to Functional Grammar, , 3rd edn.London: Arnold., London: Arnold; Hansen, A., Machin, D., Visually branding the environment: Climate change as a marketing opportunity (2008) Discourse Studies, 10 (6), pp. 777-794; Hayter, M., The social construction of 'reproductive vulnerability' in family planning clinics (2005) Journal of Advanced Nursing, 51 (1), pp. 46-54; Holland, J., Ramazanoglu, C., Scott, S., Thomson, R., (1994) AIDS: Setting a Feminist Agenda, pp. 61-79. , Lesley DTamsin WNaidoo J, ed., London: Taylor & Francis; Howson, A., Surveillance, knowledge and risk: The embodied experience of cervical screening (1998) Health, 2 (2), pp. 195-212; Kaufert, P.A., (1990) Social Science Perspectives on Medical Ethics, pp. 121-141. , Weisz G, ed., Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press; Kress, G., van Leeuwen, T., (1996) Reading Images: The Grammar of Visual Design, , 1st edn.

However, most of the studies are located in non-religious professional settings. This article presents research in a particular religious professional setting, daee/propagator of Islam-client/outsider interaction. The research aims to study the daees' spoken discourse when interacting face to face with their clients/the outsiders. This particular article focuses on the analysis and discussion of the daees/propagators of Islam's spoken discourse strategies when interacting with non-Muslim individuals/potential converts who seek conversion to Islam in a communicative event called the Conversion to Islam Ceremony at a da'wah/Islamic propagation center in Malaysia. Ethnographic discourse analysis is employed to examine the daees/propagators of Islam's spoken discourse strategies in managing and maintaining involvement when interacting with their client during the Q&A session of the event. The analysis reveals that the daees, in order to propagate Islam, engage politeness strategies, topic management strategies, code-switching and humor. © The Author(s) 2012.","da'wah discourse; discourse; ethnographic discourse analysis; investigative interview; Islamic discourse; religious discourse; religious professional setting; spoken interaction",,,,,,,,,"Ainsworth-Vaughn, N., Topic transitions in physician-patient interviews: Power, gender, and discourse change (1992) Language in Society, 21 (3), pp. 409-426; Ainsworth-Vaughn, N., (1998) Claiming Power in Doctor-Patient Talk, , Oxford: Oxford University Press; Al-Hamawi, A.W., Ibrahim, A.K., (1999) Da'wah: Getting it Right.

Therefore, it should concern us that current research evidence suggests that the discourse of public relations is growing in influence over the discourse of journalism to an extent that journalists are relinquishing their agenda-setting function (Davies, 2008; Moloney, 2006). Using the concepts of intertextuality and genre, the form and content of examples of public relations material and the news stories which resulted from them are discussed. Erjavec's (2005) method of comparative analysis is employed to examine the texts as well as discuss the discourse processes. Fairclough's (1995) argument that texts are a set of options is used to show that the options journalists are choosing are not necessarily based on the accepted rules of news values (Galtung and Ruge, 1965). © The Author(s) 2012.","Intertextuality; news discourse; news report genre; press release genre",,,,,,,,,"Bell, A., (1991) The Language of News Media, , Oxford: Basil Blackwell; Burton, B., (2007) Inside Spin: The Dark Underbelly of the PR Industry, , Sydney: Allen and Unwin; Catenaccio, P., Press releases as a hybrid genre: Addressing the informative/promotional conundrum (2008) Pragmatics, 18 (1), pp. 9-33; Davies, N., (2008) Flat Earth News, , London: Chatto and Windus; Erjavec, K., Hybrid public relations news discourse (2005) European Journal of Communication, 20 (2), pp. 155-179; Fairclough, N., (1995) Media Discourse, , London: Arnold; Fairclough, N., (2001) Language and Power, , 2nd edn.London: Longman., London: Longman; Galtung, J., Ruge, M., The structure of foreign news: The presentation of the Congo, Cuba and Cyprus crises in four Norwegian newspapers (1965) Journal of Peace Research, 2, pp. 64-79; Gandy, O., (1982) Beyond Agenda Setting.

The study explores how interviewees use their gaze, in coordination with talk, in receiving and answering adversarial questions. It is guided by conversation analysis (CA), Goffman's work on gaze in interaction, and the approach on embodied actions developed primarily by Goodwin. Gaze is described as a flexible recipient and speaker resource available for stance-taking, the downgrading and upgrading of actions, and the claiming of the floor. The study is based on taped and transcribed data from two formats of election campaign interviews on Swedish television, including 350 question and response sequences. © The Author(s) 2012.","Adversarial questions; conversation analysis; downgrading; embodied interaction; focus of attention; gaze shift; media interview; political interview; stance-taking; upgrading",,,,,,,,,"Broth, M., The studio interaction as a contextual resource for TV-production (2008) Journal of Pragmatics, 40, pp. 904-926; Bull, P., (2003) The Microanalysis of Political Communication, , London: Routledge; Bull, P., Mayer, K., Interruptions in political interviews: A study of Margaret Thatcher and Neil Kinnock (1988) Journal of Language and Social Psychology, 7, pp. 34-45; Cienki, A., Bush's and Gore's language and gestures in the 2000 US presidential debates: A test case of two models of metaphors (2004) Journal of Language and Politics, 3, pp. 409-440; Clayman, S., Answers and evasions (2001) Language in Society, 30, pp. 403-442; Clayman, S., Address terms in the service of other actions: The case of news interview talk (2010) Discourse & Communication, 4, pp. 161-183; Clayman, S., (2010) Why Do You Ask?

One important factor in this process is humor (Plester and Sayers, 2007). We present a case study of how a newcomer transitioning towards integral status interacts with the use of humor in her new workplace. Using the Communities of Practice framework (Wenger, 1998), we examine workplace discourse collected from a new recruit, Emma, and her colleagues in a Hong Kong firm. The analysis portrays a picture of how humor is a critical element as Emma negotiates relationships with other colleagues and works towards her assigned tasks. Findings suggest that humor can be an indicator to newcomers of appropriate or inappropriate behavior. Humor can be used for newcomers' integration into the workplace; humor can be used by integral members to mold newcomers into the normative ways of doing things. We argue that humor may be used as a regulating and coping mechanism in workplace socialization. © The Author(s) 2012.","Hong Kong; humor; workplace communication; workplace discourse; workplace learning; workplace socialization",,,,,,,,,"Adelsward, V., Oberg, B.-M., The function of laughter and joking in negotiation activities (1998) Humor, 11 (4), pp. 411-429; Anderson, N., Thomas, H.D.C., (1996) Handbook of Work Group Psychology, pp. 423-450. , West MA, ed., Chichester: John Wiley and Sons; Bauer, T.N., Morrison, E.W., Callister, R.R., (1998) Research in Personnel and Human Resources Management, pp. 149-214. , Ferris GR, ed., Greenwich, CT: JAI Press; Bell, A., Language style as audience design (1984) Language in Society, 13, pp. 145-204; Billett, S., Critiquing workplace learning discourses: Participation and continuity at work (2002) Studies in the Education of Adults, 34 (1), pp. 56-66; Blaka, G., Filstad, C., How does a newcomer construct identity?

This article illustrates some significant aspects of everyday uses of morality and the socio-communicative organization of public judgements on moral transgression. The article considers the range of public reactions and commentaries to a public confession of having been an informer for the former Romanian secret police. Moral reasoning around transgression takes several forms: a) invoking everyday psychological categories and morally implicative descriptions associated with identities of persons and actions; b) drawing upon culturally available metaphors and images with roots in Judaeo-Christian ethics and morality; c) using the wider political context of coming to terms with the past as foundation and criterion for moral judgement. This article argues that rather than attempting to analyse moral (public) judgement in abstract, one must focus on the everyday constructions and uses of morality found in social interaction and social responses to moral transgression. © The Author(s) 2012.","Coming to terms with the past; discourse analysis; everyday morality; moral reasoning; moral transgression; public responses to transgression",,,,,,,,,"Adler, P., Adler, P., (2000) Constructions of Deviance: Social Power, Context, and Interaction, , Belmont, CA: Wadsworth Publishing; Adut, A., (2008) On Scandal: Moral Disturbances in Society, Politics and Art, , Cambridge: Cambridge University Press; Alexander, J., (1988) Durkheimian Sociology: Cultural Studies, pp. 187-224. , Alexander J, ed., Cambridge: Cambridge University Press; Atkinson, J., Drew, P., (1979) Order in Court: The Organisation of Verbal Interaction in Judicial Settings, , London: Macmillan; Bakhtin, M., (1984) Problems of Dostoevsky's Poetics, , Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press; Becker, H., (1973) Outsiders: Studies in the Sociology of Deviance, , 2nd edn.New York: Free Press., New York: Free Press; Ben-Yehuda, N., (1990) The Politics and Morality of Deviance: Moral Panics, Drug Abuse, Deviant Science, and Reversed Stigmatization, , Albany: State University of New York Press; Berard, T., Attributions and avowals of motive in the study of deviance: Resource or topic?

Hashtags are a potent resource within this system for promoting the visibility of a Twitter update (and, by implication, the update's author). This study analyses the frequency, types and grammatical context of hashtags which occurred in a dataset of approximately 92,000 tweets, taken from 100 publically available Twitter accounts, comparing the discourse styles of corporations, celebrity practitioners and 'ordinary' Twitter members. The results suggest that practices of self-branding and micro-celebrity operate on a continuum which reflects and reinforces the social and economic hierarchies which exist in offline contexts. Despite claims that hashtags are 'conversational', this study suggests that participatory culture in Twitter is not evenly distributed, and that the discourse of celebrity practitioners and corporations exhibits the synthetic personalization (Fairclough, 1989) typical of mainstream media forms of broadcast talk. © The Author(s) 2012.","Broadcast talk; hashtags; identity; micro-celebrity; participatory culture; self-branding; Twitter",,,,,,,,,"Anstead, N., O'Loughlin, B., (2010) The Emerging Viewertariat: Explaining Twitter Responses to Nick Griffin's Appearance on BBC Question Time, , http://newpolcom.rhul.ac.uk/storage/Anstead_OLoughlin_BBCQT_Twitter_Final.pdf, UEA School of Political, Social and International Studies Working Paper Series 1.

This is a paradigm shift from verbal argumentation to visual argumentation. The aim of this article is to contribute to the understanding of visual analysis and visual literacy, a part of discourse analysis. Visuals employ a number of rhetorical devices; however, understanding the effectiveness of these devices is still a challenge. Adopting Visual Argumentation Theory, the article analyzes argumentation in cartoons on the post-election violence that rocked Kenya in 2007/2008. From the analyses, it is concluded that visuals can argue as simply and forcefully as their verbal counterparts. The blending of caricature and portraiture makes them even more explicit as portraiture denotes the characters so that we can recognize who they are; caricature ridicules them, analogy attributes actions to them in a satirical or sarcastic way, and cultural memory is needed to access the reference to the analogies. Visuals are designed to make the reader think not only about the event or the people being portrayed but also about the message being communicated. This means visuals have the ability to stretch the truth beyond caricature or mere amusement. © The Author(s) 2012.","Caricature; cartoons; cultural memory; emotional memory; portraiture; visual analogy; visual analysis; visual arguments",,,,,,,,,"Barbatsis, G.S., Look, and I will show you something you will want to see': Pictorial engagement in negative political campaign commercials (1996) Argumentation and Advocacy, 33, pp. 69-78; Barthes, R., (1977) Image, Music, Text, , London: Fontana Press; Birdsell, D.S., Groarke, L., Toward a theory of visual argument (1996) Argumentation and Advocacy, 33, pp. 1-10; Blair, J.A., The possibility and actuality of visual arguments (1996) Argumentation and Advocacy, 33, pp. 23-39; Burack, J., (1994) Understanding and Creating Editorial Cartoons: A Resource Guide, , Madison, WI: Knowledge Unlimited; El Refaie, E., Understanding visual metaphor: The example of newspaper cartoon (2003) Visual Communication, 2 (1), pp. 75-95; Fleming, D., Can pictures be arguments?

By examining ST applications in three interpersonal relationships (business stranger, friend and partner), the author explores how the interactional patterns of ST are associated with communicators' interpersonal cognitive processes, demonstrating why ST should not be deemed 'small' in task-oriented contexts. The findings yield that ST constructs an integral, and even essential, part of business communication for various social and professional purposes. Its allocations, topic typologies and move systems in negotiations are not randomly positioned, selected and developed, but strategically organized and interpersonally related. As a meaningful, politic and intentional activity, ST reflects business people's social and professional cognition, relational negotiation and interactive frame, forming communicative primitives that are used in the underlying negotiation, the rapport management in negotiation and cultural disciplines for business people. © SAGE Publications 2012.","Business negotiations; interpersonal relations; rapport management; small talk",,,,,,"Guangdong University of Foreign Studies, GDUFS: 11YJA740064

The article describes two dominant interpretive strategies Hungarian speakers use to identify instances of 'hate speech'. Motivated by an interest in the observable use of the term, the author draws on speech codes theory to investigate how public speakers use the two competing meanings of 'hate speech' to achieve moral challenges and counter-challenges in broadcast talk. The author finds that Hungarian speakers accused of 'hate speech' can effectively accomplish denials in response to actual or anticipated normative challenges by opting for an alternative meaning of 'hate speech'.

This article employs Appraisal theory in a comparative analysis of BP's and IKEA's 2009 social reports, each company's record of their non-financial performance. The main objective is to explore how, through Appraisal resources, BP and IKEA construct their corporate identity and relationship with their stakeholders. The analysis reveals two markedly different approaches to the construction of a responsible corporate identity. While BP deploys interpersonal resources to portray itself as a trustworthy and authoritative expert, IKEA discloses itself as a sensitive and caring corporation, engaged in a continual effort to improve. These differences are interpreted in light of the legitimization challenges the two companies face. © SAGE Publications 2012.","Appraisal; corporate identity; corporate social reports; corporate social responsibility; corpus-based approaches to evaluation; discourse analysis; evaluation; legitimacy theory; stance",,,,,,,,,"Adams, C., Harte, G., The changing portrayal of the employment of women in British banks' and retail companies' corporate annual reports (1998) Accounting, Organizations and Society, 23 (8), pp. 781-812; Arnold, P., The state and political theory in corporate social disclosure research: A response to Guthrie and Parker (1990) Advances in Public Interest Accounting, 3 (2), pp. 177-181; Artstein, R., Poesio, M., Inter-coder agreement for computational linguistics (2008) Computational Linguistics, 34 (4), pp. 555-596; Bakhtin, M., (1981) The Dialogical Imagination, , Austin: University of Texas Press; Bebbington, J., Larrinaga, C., Moneva, J., Corporate social reporting and reputation risk management (2008) Accounting, Auditing & Accountability Journal, 21 (3), pp. 337-361; Bednarek, M., (2006) Evaluation in Media Discourse: Analysis of a Newspaper Corpus, , London: Continuum International Publishing Group Ltd; Biber, D., Finegan, E., Adverbial stance types in English (1988) Discourse Processes, 11 (1), pp. 1-34; Biber, D., Finegan, E., Styles of stance in English: Lexical and grammatical marking of evidentiality and affect (1989) Text: Interdisciplinary Journal for the Study of Discourse, 9 (1), pp. 93-124; Biber, D., Johansson, S., Leech, G., Conrad, S., Finegan, E., Quirk, R., (1999) Longman Grammar of Spoken and Written English, , Cambridge, MA: MIT Press; Brown, N., Deegan, C., The public disclosure of environmental performance information: A dual test of media agenda setting theory and legitimacy theory (1998) Accounting and Business Research, 29 (1), pp. 21-41; Buhr, N., Environmental performance, legislation and annual report disclosure: The case of acid rain and Falconbridge (1998) Accounting, Auditing & Accountability Journal, 11 (2), pp. 163-190; Buhr, N., Reiter, S., Ideology, the environment and one world view: A discourse analysis of Noranda's environmental and sustainable development reports (2006) Advances in Environmental Accounting & Management, 3, pp. 1-48. , In: Freedman M and Jaggi B (eds), Bradford: Emerald Group Publishing Limited; Campbell, D., Craven, B., Shrives, P., Voluntary social reporting in three FTSE sectors: A comment on perception and legitimacy (2003) Accounting, Auditing & Accountability Journal, 16 (4), pp. 558-581; Carroll, A., Shabana, K., The business case for corporate social responsibility: A review of concepts, research and practice (2010) International Journal of Management Reviews, 12 (1), pp. 85-105; Chafe, W., Nichols, J., (1986) Evidentiality: The Linguistic Coding of Epistemology, , (eds), Norwood, NJ: Ablex Publishing Corporation; Chafe, W., Evidentiality in English conversation and academic writing (1986) Evidentiality: The Linguistic Coding of Epistemology, pp. 261-272. , In: Chafe W and Nichols J (eds), Norwood, NJ: Ablex Publishing Corporation; Cohen, J., A coefficient of agreement for nominal scales (1960) Educational and Psychological Measurement, 20 (1), pp. 37-46; Conrad, S., Biber, D., Adverbial marking of stance in speech and writing (2000) Evaluation in Text: Authorial Stance and the Construction of Discourse, pp. 56-73. , In: Hunston S and Thompson G (eds), Oxford: Oxford University Press; Deegan, C., Introduction: The legitimising effect of social and environmental disclosures - a theoretical foundation (2002) Accounting, Auditing & Accountability Journal, 15 (3), pp. 282-311; Deegan, C., Gordon, B., A study of the environmental disclosure practices of Australian corporations (1996) Accounting and Business Research, 26, pp. 187-199; Deegan, C., Rankin, M., Do Australian companies report environmental news objectively?

Based on the recorded mobile communication of 14-year-olds in Denmark and a conversation-analytic approach, the article will show that after a text message in a continuous communication sequence, four different types of conversation may follow: the answer (after a text message demanding a reply), the reminder (in case of a missing text message), the resumption of conversation (after a closed text message exchange) and the confirmation (after a text message with a request for/promise of a call). In itself, the change from text message to conversation requires no interactional efforts from the participants. However, changes of mode are related to the different communicative possibilities the text message and the phone call offer: text messages and calls have distinct formal qualities that govern their uses, and participants in a given sequence move between the two modes, exploiting the potential of each as they ascribe meaning to the written and spoken media. © SAGE Publications 2012.","CMC; conversation analysis; interconnected communication sequences; mobile phone calls; mobile phone communication; sequence organization; SMS; technologically mediated interaction; telephone communication; text messaging; young people",,,,,,,,,"Arminen, I., Leinonen, M., Mobile phone call openings: Tailoring answers to personalized summonses (2006) Discourse Studies, 8 (3), pp. 339-368; Firth, A., (1991) Discourse at Work: Negotiating by Telex, Fax and Phone, , Aalborg: Aalborg University; Fortunati, L., (2001) The mobile phone between orality and writing.

However, little attention has been paid to advertorials as an emerging hybridized genre. To identify the generic and linguistic characteristics of advertorials, and therefore to classify advertorials into an appropriate genre, this study carries out a comprehensive genre analysis of advertorials based on Bhatia's (1993) seven-step genre analysis methodology. A corpus of 55 advertorials was collected from four English-language magazines and two English-language newspapers, from which a sub-corpus of 12 samples was further selected for a thorough examination of linguistic characteristics. Attempting to gain a comprehensive view of generic features of advertorials, this study makes a critical comparison of advertorials with three inextricably related genres: advertisements, news stories and editorials. Linguistic evidence sufficiently demonstrates that advertorials share fundamental generic and linguistic natures with advertisements and proposes classifying advertorials as a sub-genre of advertisements. © The Author(s) 2012.","Advertorial; appraisal theory; evaluative language; genre analysis; move analysis",,,,,,"Universidade de Macau, UM","This research was supported by the University of Macau as well as by the Erasmus Mundus MULTI research project.",,"Bhatia, V.K., (1993) Analyzing Genre: Language Use in Professional Settings, , London: Longman; Bhatia, V.K., (2004) Worlds of Written Discourse: A Genre-Based View, , London: Continuum; Brett, P., A genre analysis of the results section of sociology articles (1994) English for Specific Purposes, 13 (1), pp. 47-59; Halliday, M.A.K., (1994) Introduction to Functional Grammar, , London: Edward Arnold; He, P., (2006) Genre Analysis on English Political Speaking, , http://www.read.com.tw/web/hypage.cgi?HYPAGE=index.htm, Available at, (accessed 6 December 2006); Holmes, R., Genre analysis and social sciences: An investigation of the structure of research article discussion section in three disciplines (1997) English for Specific Purposes, 16 (4), pp. 321-337; Martin, J.R., White, P.R.R., (2005) The Language of Evaluation: Appraisal in English, , New York: Palgrave Macmillan; Mulken, M., Meer, W., Are you being served?

Hedges and boosters, two subcategories of metadiscourse markers, are among the rhetorical tropes which assist politicians to increase or decrease commitment, blur or sharpen the boundaries between good and evil, and bolster or emasculate solidarity. Despite the many functions hedges and boosters can play in political discourse, studies that address these devices in relation to their persuasive effect in televised presidential debates cross-linguistically are tremendously scant. To this aim, the current study examined the hedging and boosting strategies used by the winners of American and Iranian presidential elections during one of their latest televised debates. A bottom-up method of analysis was adopted to analyze the debates in terms of hedges and boosters, and a functional model in light of what surfaced in the analysis along with awareness of the existing literature (e.g. Fraser, 2010a; Holmes, 1984) was proposed. The study showed that not only were the frequencies significantly different, but the functions these devices fulfilled were also varied cross-linguistically as the winners of both groups (Obama and Ahmadinejad) demonstrated diverse tendencies towards using hedges and boosters. © The Author(s) 2012.","Boosters; hedges; Iran; televised presidential debates; the United States",,,,,,,,,"Bashiriyeh, H., (2002) Dibäche'ee bar Jäme'é-Shenäsiyé Siäsiyé Iran, , Tehran: Negähé Mo'äser Publication; Benoit, W.L., Acclaiming, attacking, and defending in presidential nominating acceptance addresses, 1960-1996 (1999) Quarterly Journal of Speech, 85, pp. 247-267; Benoit, W.L., Harthcock, A., Functions of the great debates: Acclaims, attacks, and defenses in the 1960 presidential debates (1999) Communication Monographs, 66, pp. 341-357; Bhatia, A., Critical discourse analysis of political press conferences (2006) Discourse & Society, 17 (2), pp. 173-203; Blas-Arroyo, J.L., No diga chorradas: La descortesia en el debate político cara a cara.

It takes the theoretical concept of interdiscursivity in critical genre analysis to show that texts are the result of a combination of a very complex range of resources brought about by genres, professional practices and professional cultures, which derive not only from the 'local' representation of the transnational arbitration process, but also from the different corporate identities and their ways of coping with the increasing publicity of the facts of arbitration. © The Author(s) 2011.","confidentiality versus publicity; corporate press releases; critical genre analysis; interdiscursivity; international commercial arbitration practices; media discourse; news reports; professional discourse",,,,,,"FFI2009-09792

WIPO domain name arbitration consists of an alternative dispute resolution process in which one or more panelists make a binding decision over the legitimacy of a domain. This article investigates the structure of the discourse of this professional genre. Following Maley (1987), this study focuses, first, on spotting the generic moves of WIPO domain name arbitration decisions. Second, the analysis unveils patterns shaping WIPO domain name arbitration decisions, hence exploring how discursive features work within this specialized discourse. Third, it examines whether corpus data reveal that this type of professional discourse has entered into a process of standardization. The study is based on Bhatia's multi-perspective four-space model of discourse (2004). This analytical framework emphasizes a multidisciplinary and multidimensional perspective which highlights that discourse is indistinguishable from constructing reality. © The Author(s) 2011.","corpus-based analysis; discourse analysis; domain name arbitration; efficiency; genre studies; professional discourse; standardization; World Intellectual Property Organization",,,,,,,,,"Austin, J.L., (1962) How to Do Things with Words?, , Oxford: Oxford University Press; Austin, J.L., (1970) Philosophical Papers, , Oxford: Oxford University Press; Bagner, H., Confidentiality: A fundamental principle in international commercial arbitration?

That Western and Arabic ideologies arise from divergent political, national, cultural, and religious traditions is well understood in the West. Indeed, this understanding is generally implicit and unconscious, often leading to perception of Arabic culture and ideology as a monolithic whole. Lost in this division between 'Us' and 'Other' are the multitude of inner-Arabic ideological divisions. Among these is an important inner-Arabic ideological division that reflects the larger Arab-Western ideological split, a split between those in support of Saddam's reign and the post-invasion Iraqi insurgency and those in opposition. Cultural ideologies, all-encompassing yet often unstated, are difficult to summarize and analyze through the examination of indigenous news media. The media must balance truthful accuracy and objectivity with self-preservation. They must be exceedingly sensitive to the moods and outlooks of their target audiences in order to survive politically as well as economically. This work is a comparative, descriptive analysis of Saddam's execution as covered by Arab and Western media, making use of Van Dijk's Socio-ideological Discourse Theory as embodied in the Theories of Semantic Macroproposition and the concept of the Ideological Square as well as the Discourse-Historical Approach of Wodak. This combination of theoretical elements constitutes a basis for comparative Arabic-English discourse analysis with a focus on socio-linguistic analysis of text and rhetoric, rather than the more common functional Systemic Linguistic analysis or grammar theory considerations. These analytical elements also enable the de-construction of news media coverage in terms of macro-microstructures, micro-semantics, and the rhetoric news discourse. Technical analysis of news article word count, lexical selection, grammar, literary style, and rhetoric provides a portal through which hidden opinion, ideology, and dogma are made visible. © The Author(s) 2011.","Arab power discourse; Arabic news text; Arabic newspaper discourse; critical discourse analysis; cross-cultural communication; English-Arabic discourse",,,,,,,,,"Ali, G., (2010) How Arab Journalists Translate English-Language Newspaper Headlines: Case Studies in Cross-Cultural Understanding, , New York: Edwin Mellen Press; Baalbaki, M., (1996) AlMawrid English-Arabic, Arabic-English Dictionary, , Beirut: Librairie du Liban; Bell, A., (1991) The Language of News Media, , Oxford: Blackwell; (1998) Approaches to Media Discourse, , Bell AGarrett P, ed., Oxford: Blackwell Publishers; (1987) Hans Wehr: A Dictionary of Modern Written Arabic (Arabic-English), , Cowan JM, ed., Beirut: Librairie Du Liban; Evans, H., (1976) News Headlines: An Illustrated Guide, , London: Heinemann; Fowler, R., (1991) Language in the News: Discourse and Ideology in the British Press, , London: Routledge; Jucker, A., News actor labeling in British News (1996) Text, 16, pp. 373-390; Mardh, I., (1980) Headlinese: On the Grammar of English Front Page Headlines, , LiberLaromedel Lund: CWK Gleerup; van Dijk, T.A., (1980) Macrostructures, , Hillsdale, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum; van Dijk, T.A., (1980) Macrostructures: An Interdisciplinary Study of Global Structures in Discourse, Interaction, and Cognition, , Hillsdale, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum; Van Dijk, T.A., (1985) Handbook of Discourse Analysis, , van Dijk T.A., ed., London: Academic Press; Van Dijk, T.A., (1985) Discourse and Communication: New Approaches to the Analysis of Mass Media Discourse and Communication, , van Dijk T.A., ed., New York: Walter de Gruyter; van Dijk, T.A., (1985) Structures of News in the Press: Discourse and Communication, , Berlin: Walter de Gruyter; van Dijk, T.A., (1988) News Analysis: Case Studies of International and National News in the Press, , Hillsdale, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum; van Dijk, T.A., (1988) News as Discourse, , Hillsdale, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum; van Dijk, T.A., (1991) Racism and the Press, , London: Routledge; van Dijk, T.A., (1998) Ideology: A Multidisciplinary Approach, , London: SAGE; van Dijk, T.A., (1998) Language Structure, Discourse and the Access to Consciousness, pp. 189-226. , Stamenov M, ed., Amsterdam: John Benjamins; Wodak, R., (2001) Methods of Critical Discourse Analysis, , Wodak RMeyer M, ed., London: SAGE; (2008) Qualitative Discourse Analysis in the Social Sciences, , Wodak RKrzyzanowski M, ed., Basingstoke: Palgrave Macmillan","Ali, G.

It focuses on the role of metaphor in constructing a common 'imagining' of international diplomacy and legitimizing an international organizational identity. The SG legitimizes the organization, in part, through the delegitimization of agents/actions/events constructed as threatening to the international community and to the well-being of mankind. It is a desire to combat the forces of menace or evil which are argued to motivate and determine the organizational agenda. This is predicated upon an international ideology of humanity in which difference is silenced and 'working towards the common good' is emphasized. This is exploited to rouse emotions and legitimize institutional power.

Consultations are fully transcribed and analysed to understand the participatory roles patients' companions play in the medical exchanges. In addition, the type of linguistic functions associated with each role and the advantages or downsides of companions' involvement in the encounters are also investigated. The analysis reveals seven prominent roles that companions may engage in during the visits. These are studied in detail. The results show that although companions may not always provide information that is consistent with the patients' views, they can be of great help. Relieving the patients of many daunting tasks, monitoring their well-being, establishing a partnership and bringing vital information to the clinic are instances where the controlling power that some may exercise in the medical encounter can be outweighed. © The Author(s) 2011.","cancer consultations; Chilean Spanish interactive patterns; medical communication; participatory roles; triadic medical exchanges",,,,,,,"This research would not have been possible without the support received from both the hospital and its extraordinarily committed oncological team.

Despite its importance, however, there is relatively little (socio)linguistic research which looks at the complex ways in which problems are constructed in discourse. This article sees the enactment of a 'problem' as a discursive phenomenon with fluid boundaries. It draws on business meeting data recorded in multinational companies in Europe and focuses on excerpts identified by the participants as having a PbS function. The data show that problem solving processes and practice are anchored to the structure of the organizations, the local history and employees' shared perceptions of professional practices and hierarchies in their workplace. The analysis also shows two focal points in the PbS talk of the participants in this study, namely identification of a problem (what the problem is) and its ownership (whose problem it is). These, however, are not predetermined starting points but rather locally constructed in relation to the status, expertise and shared/past history of the interactants. © The Author(s) 2011.","decision-making; meeting talk; multinational companies; problem solving talk",,,,,,,,,"Angouri, J., Language in the Workplace (2007) A Multimethod Study of Communicative Activity in Seven Multinational Companies Situated in Europe, , PhD Thesis, University of Essex; Angouri, J., Using textbook and real life data to teach turn taking in business meetings (2010) Handbook of Teaching Materials, pp. 373-395. , In: Harwood N (ed.), Cambridge: Cambridge University Press; Angouri, J., Harwood, N., This is too formal for us.

Their talk appears dilemmatic: 'sympathy talk', comprising rhetorical displays of 'care', tolerance and aesthetic evaluations, is woven together with more pejorative messages. In this article we investigate how 'sympathy talk' functions as a discursive resource in talk-in-interaction when people give accounts of minority group individuals. A 'synthetic' discursive psychological approach was employed to analyse a corpus of 12 talkback radio calls to an evening 'shock jock' radio personality in Adelaide, Australia, after the stabbing death of a Sudanese-Australian refugee. Analysis shows how host and callers dialogically negotiate and orientate to various sympathetic and humanitarian descriptions/evaluations. We contend that sympathetic talk advances the activity of conversation, softening complaints that could be made accountable as prejudiced. Sympathy talk also functions as a counter-argument to perceived punitive or 'racist' complaints. Moreover, this article proposes that such rhetoric shares an ideological thread that potentially undermines Sudanese refugees' social positioning. Dialogue that deploys sympathetic formulations may be an element in the increasingly varied and subtle activity of 'new racism'.

A case in point was the sport talk show interview. The data included an interview extracted from the Iranian popular sport show, Navad (meaning 'ninety'), broadcast every Monday by Channel 3 in Iran. The interview was with the former president of the Football Federation of the Islamic Republic of Iran (IRIFF). Analysis of the data was done within the framework of Toulmin's (2003) conception of argument as a form of conversation. Accordingly, the propositions produced collaboratively by the host and guests were used to reconstruct the argument structure of the interview in terms of Toulminian schemata. The qualitative analysis of the data revealed that: 1) the argument structure of the interview was that of substantial argument (argument requiring an inference to move from the data to the claim) rather than the analytic one. 2) Little if any formal validity (the validity of the argument in terms of the notion of forms) was found in the skeleton of the argument. 3) The talk seemed to be subjective, and backing and qualifier elements widely used by the guest were not in some parts satisfactory. 4) Warrant, considered as one of the essential components of practical arguments, was not, in some parts, explicitly referred to, but must have been be implicitly inferred by the listeners. © The Author(s) 2011.","argumentation theory; media discourse; sport talk show interview; talk show",,,,,,,,,"Bell, P., van Leeuwen, T., (1994) The Media Interview: Confession, Contest, Conversation, , Kensington, NSW: University of New South Wales Press; Blum-Kulka, S., The many faces of With Meni: The history and stories of one Israeli talk show (2001) Television Talk Shows: Discourse, Performance, Spectacle, pp. 89-116. , In: Tolson A (ed.)., Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum; Clayman, S., Heritage, J., (2002) The News Interview: Journalists and Public Figures on the Air, , Cambridge: Cambridge University Press; Fetzer, A., Well if that had been true, that would have been perfectly reasonable: Appeals to reasonableness in political interviews (2007) Journal of Pragmatics, 39, pp. 1342-1359; Grice, H.P., Logic and conversation (1975) Syntax and semantics, Vol. 3: Speech Acts, pp. 41-58. , In: Cole J and Morgan J (eds), New York: Academic Press; Haarman, L., Argument, style and performance in audience discussion shows (1997) Understanding Argument.

Do women make less of a linguistic impact in the boardroom than men? By analysing linguistic data from senior management meetings and follow-up interviews in seven multinational UK companies, we suggest that senior women and men use a very similar range of linguistic strategies to lead their teams except in one key respect. Women appear to monitor and regulate their use of language more than men, adjusting what they say in the light of their colleagues' concerns and agendas. This use of 'double-voiced discourse' (Bakhtin, 1994/1963) enables women to survive in a male-dominated business world, but this can sometimes make their voice 'harder to hear'. However, double-voiced discourse is also a form of linguistic expertise and potentially might offer women leaders a strategy for success. © The Author(s) 2011.","double-voiced discourse; gender; interactional sociolinguistic analysis; leadership discourse; linguistic expertise; senior women; workplace talk",,,,,,"Economic and Social Research Council, ESRC: ES/G035008/1",,,"Angouri, J., We are in a masculine profession': Doing gender in a consortium of two multinational engineering companies Gender and Language, Special Issue on 'gender and Language in the Workplace, 4 (2). , (in press) (ed.

Our purpose is to establish rhetorical moves that exist in these 419 messages, and then analyze the intention of the scammers behind each move - a scam must shake the potential victim out of the status quo behavior. In other words, how is the content of particular moves able to facilitate change in a potential victim's mind, goading him or her to unwise action? After examining each move in light of features considered necessary for mind change, it was determined that the scammers are most concerned about building solidarity with the mark and playing to a mark's egocentrism, both of which keep the mark from making well-informed decisions. © The Author(s) 2011.","419; change; con game; discourse analysis; persuasion; rhetorical moves; scam; trigger",,,,,,,,,"(2008), http://www.419baiter.com/, 419 Baiter.com,Available online at,accessed 17 September,2009; Andersson, B., Gunnarsson, B., A Contrastive Study of Text Patterns in Conference Abstracts (1995), in B.

Previous research into aspects of student interaction that take place within university tutorial sessions has suggested that different kinds of student identity come into conflict as students interact, face-to-face. Most notably, the imperative of 'doing education' - as a keen proto-academic seeking a good final degree classification - is often overridden by the imperative of 'doing being a student' - as an average and/or indifferent student who does not stand out. In this article, however, it is not the university tutorial but a slightly different and hitherto unexplored site of interaction that is foregrounded: the university library textbook. As with tutorials, the margins of library textbooks are spaces within which individually accomplished research becomes publicly observable - in the former as group work, and in the latter as student marginalia. Drawing on discourse analytic concepts such as 'footing' and 'stake' this article seeks to understand what student marginalia can tell us about the ways in which the tension between 'doing education' and 'doing being a student' is managed and negotiated in sites other than the university tutorial. © The Author(s) 2011.","academic culture; discourse analysis; footing; library textbooks; marginalia; stake; student identities",,,,,,,,,"Basturkmen, H., (1996) The Discourse of Academic Seminars: Structures and Strategies of Interaction', Unpublished PhD Thesis, , Aston University, Birmingham; Benwell, B., (1996) The Discourse of University Tutorials', Unpublished PhD Thesis, , University of Nottingham; Benwell, B., The Organisation of Knowledge in British University Tutorial Discourse: Issues, Pedagogic Discourse Strategies and Disciplinary Identity (1999) Pragmatics, 9 (4), pp. 535-565; Benwell, B., Stokoe, E., Constructing Discussion Tasks in University Tutorials: Shifting Dynamics and Identities (2002) Discourse and Society, 4 (4), pp. 429-453; Benwell, B., Stokoe, E.H., The Social in the Educational and the Educational in the Social: University Students Interacting in Ordinary and Institutional Settings (2009), Conference Presentation at 42nd Annual Meeting Language, Learning, and Context, Newcastle University; Benwell, B., Stokoe, E.H., University Students Resisting Academic Identity Language In Use: A Reader, pp. 83-94. , in P.

I propose that in the British Parliament's House of Lords, interlocutors deal with dilemmas of disagreement by doing something I refer to as 'talking around the issue', a practice involving 1) institutional positioning, 2) display of emotionality, and 3) orientation to the issue. I suggest that these practices are indicative of institutional norms, but also comprise some of the argumentative resources available to interactants in everyday argumentative practice. These practices also reflect key areas of interest in disagreement and conflict research related to context, style, and issues in conflict. © The Author(s) 2011.","argument; conflict; context; disagreement; discourse analysis; emotionality; institutionality; politics; positioning; strategy",,,,,,,,,"Bailey, F.G., (1983) The Tactical Uses of Passion: An Essay on Power, Reason, and Reality, , London: Cornell University Press; Baldwin, N., The Membership and Work of the House of Lords (1999) The House of Lords: Its Parliamentary and Judicial Role, pp. 29-52. , in P.

Not only have advances in technology changed the ways in which audiences engage with business information, the pervasiveness of internet and cable television networks has led to the emergence of new hybrid forms of business news discourse, blending verbiage, images, graphics, audio, and video clips. Combining discourse analysis, social semiotic theory, and other interdisciplinary approaches, this article explores the multiple ways in which business news are mediated on the internet by continuous 24-hour business news networks such as Bloomberg, CNBC, FOXBusiness, and Reuters. In particular, this article is concerned with how events are contextualized, that is, how identities and social relationships are constructed and represented within and across different modes, media, and networks. The analysis focuses on what is foregrounded or backgrounded, what is thematized or unthematized in each mode and medium, and what process types and categories are drawn upon to represent events, social actors, and social (inter)actions. In this context, special interest is being paid to the semiotic shifts or transformations (and ensuing re-contextualizations) that multimodal representations undergo across modes, media, and news networks. © The Author(s) 2011.","business news discourse; cable network television; cable news networks; discourse analysis; internet news; multimodal representations; online business news; recontextualization; social actor; social interaction; social semiotic theory",,,,,,,,,"Bateman, J., Delin, J., Henschel, R., Mapping the Multimodal Genres of Traditional and Electronic Newspapers (2007) New Directions in the Analysis of Multimodal Discourse, pp. 147-172. , in T.D.

This article aims to explore non-lexicalized allusion variation between TS headlines and NYT headlines as a discourse strategy. A textual survey was conducted on a corpus comprising 605 TS news articles and their corresponding NYT articles. Non-lexicalized allusions were identified and explored within a reader-oriented approach. And a stylistic analysis was performed to explore cognitive, pragmatic, and rhetorical roles of non-lexicalized allusions in the corpus. The results show that non-lexicalized allusions occur in far fewer TS than NYT headlines. The allusion downsizing increases the accessibility of TS headlines to general TS readers at the cost of cultural diverseness and stylistic expressiveness in the headline language, making the language of TS headlines stylistically more restricted and culturally less Western. NYT headline language exemplifies English as a native language (ENL), whereas TS headline language is a specific genre of English as an international language (EIL). This article also discusses cultural implications of non-lexicalized allusions for EIL learning. It is pointed out that EIL is an integration of elements of all varieties of English involved in international or intercultural discourse. The cultural knowledge behind non-lexicalized allusions dealt with in this article represents one such element of EIL. © 2011 The Author(s).","EIL culture; Headlines; Non-lexicalized allusions; The New York Times; The Times Supplement",,,,,,,,,"Alptekin, C., Toward Intercultural Communicative Competence in ELT (2002) ELT Journal, 56 (1), pp. 57-64; Alptekin, C., Alptekin, M., The Question of Culture: EFL Teaching in Non-English Speaking Countries (1984) ELT Journal, 38 (1), pp. 3-10; Bal, M., (1997) Narratology: Introduction to the Theory of Narrative, , 2nd edn, Toronto: University of Toronto Press; Barthes, R., (1977) Image-Music-Text, , London: Fontana; Bartlett, F.C., (1932) Remembering: A Study in Experimental and Social Psychology, , Cambridge: Cambridge University Press; Bell, A., (1991) The Language of the News Media, , Oxford: Basil Blackwell; Bronson, F., (2003) The Billboard Book of Number One Hits, , 4th edn, New York: Watson-Guptill Publications; Chovanec, J., Focus on Form: Foregrounding Devices in Football Reporting (2008) Discourse & Communication, 2 (3), pp. 219-242; Cortazzi, M., Jin, L., Cultural Mirrors: Materials and Methods in the EFL Classroom (1999) Culture in Second Language Teaching, pp. 196-219. , in E.

As they do so, they make clear what they know, whether they already know it or are discovering it in the moment, whether it comes from the file in hand, and whether the applicant holds primary rights to confirm or amend that information. In these moments, participants work out issues of epistemic authority through an orchestration of multimodal behaviors, including talk, gesture, gaze, and touch. Our analysis focuses specifically on two discourse slots: when interviewers confirm specific information in side sequences; and when they gloss and assess general information while calling for an account. In the former, interviewers display minimal knowledge and secondary (deferred) epistemic authority; in the latter, they show strong knowledge and assert primary epistemic authority. This article demonstrates how epistemic authority, negotiated through embodied talk-in-interaction, contributes to how interviews unfold. © 2011 The Author(s).","Accounts; Conversation analysis; Employment interviews; Epistemic authority; Gaze; Gesture; Multimodality; Questions; Touch",,,,,,,,,"Argote, L., McEvily, B., Reagans, R., Managing Knowledge in Organizations: An Integrative Framework and Review of Emerging Themes (2003) Management Science, 49 (4), pp. 571-582; Atkinson, J., Heritage, J., (1984) Structures of Social Action, , Cambridge: Cambridge University Press; Button, G., Answers as Interactional Products: Two Sequential Practices Used in Job Interviews (1992) Talk at Work, pp. 101-134. , in P.

After reviewing past work on stancetaking and person referencing, I provide background on appellate oral argument and the three cases. Combining discourse analysis with simple quantitative coding, the study shows that attorneys' and judges' choices of terms for gay parties and the frequency of their use marked the stance of appellate parties toward same-sex marriage. Then, I describe how person-referencing terms for gays, both in the larger society and in appellate courts, changed in the 20 years preceding the cases. The article concludes by arguing for the value of studying state appellate court discourse; I also reflect about the complexities in linking changes in usage of person-referencing terms with attitudinal stance changes. © 2011 The Author(s).","Appellate discourse; Membership categorization; Oral argument; Person reference; Same-sex marriage; Stance; State supreme courts",,,,,,,,,"Amsterdam, A.G., Bruner, J., (2000) Minding the Law, , Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press; Andersen, R., Fetner, T., Cohort Differences in Tolerance of Homosexuality: Attitudinal Change in Canada and the United States (2008) Public Opinion Quarterly, 72, pp. 311-330. , 1981-2000; Benoit, W., Attorney Argumentation and Supreme Court Opinions (1989) Argumentation and Advocacy, 26, pp. 22-38; Besnier, N., Literacy and Feeling: The Encoding of Affect in Nukulaelae Letters (1989) Text, 9, pp. 69-91; Biber, D., Finegan, E., Styles of Stance in English: Lexical and Grammatical Marking of Evidentiality and Affect (1989) Text, 9, pp. 93-124; Brown, P., Levinson, S.C., Universals in Language Usage: Politeness Phenomena (1978) Questions and Politeness: Strategies in Social Interaction, pp. 56-310. , in E.N.

Specifically, it explores how images (photographs and videos) captured by ordinary people on their mobile devices were used in the live news reportage of 7/7 and, given the current salience of commemorative journalism, how these were (re-)used in the tragedy's first year anniversary coverage. The analysis reveals broadcasters' selection of uniform, repetitive and 'sanitized' mobile media footage, as well as a tendency towards non-attribution. This article contributes to the scant body of discourse analytic research into 'participatory journalism' practices, particularly their interaction with 'traditional' forms of journalism. © 2011 The Author(s).","Commemoration; Means of framing; Mobile media; Participatory journalism; Recontextualization; Television news; The 2005 London bombings",,,,,,"Arts and Humanities Research Council, AHRC: AH/E002579/1

The secondary aim is to understand why the need for legitimacy was the reason behind the Government's decision to allow media coverage of the disaster. Critical linguistics and critical discourse analysis underpin the study. The article concludes that the Government's aim in 'opening up' access to the media to provide coverage was to provide a public relations exercise, nationally and globally, of the Communist Party of China's governance capabilities. © The Author(s) 2010.","Chinese media; disaster; discourse; legitimacy; myth",,,,,,,,,"Adorno, T., Freudian Theory and the Pattern of Fascist Propaganda (2001) The Culture Industry: Selected Essays on Mass Culture, pp. 132-157. , in J.M.

A stated goal of such police work is to be service-minded and contribute to a positive encounter. This article analyses service requests in calls to the duty desk of a large police station and focuses on how officers deal with requests that have to be rejected. It reveals a general pattern in which officers produce the rejection in a dispreferred format and include displays of empathy, accounts for the rejection and suggestions for alternative solutions. However, in certain types of requests the rejections are not infrequently produced in a direct and unmitigated fashion, without accounts or explanations.This is especially notable in requests that touch upon institutional constraints, such as professional secrecy. And in certain cases the rejections are even delivered in an aggravated form, involving an explicit or implicit challenge to the legitimacy of the request. These rejections cast the caller in an oppositional role, infringing the professional constraints of the police. However, the constraints in question may not be accessible to the callers. The officers will consequently be experienced as hostile and will subvert their own objectives of showing service-mindedness. © The Author(s) 2010.","conflict; police communication; preference organization; rejections; requests; service interaction; service-mindedness; telephone calls",,,,,,,,,"Bolden, G., Beyond Answering: Repeat-prefaced Responses in Conversation Communication Monographs, 76, pp. 121-143; Couper-Kuhlen, E., A Sequential Approach to Affect: The Case of 'Disappointment (2009) Talk in Interaction - Comparative Dimensions, pp. 94-123. , in M.

Using critical discourse analysis, we examined interjournalistic discourse about African Americans in national network and cable news programs that aired after Hurricane Katrina reached New Orleans. While we expected conversational semantic items from conservative Fox News to reflect racial ideology, we also found such discursive elements from politically moderate and progressive news organizations such as CBS, CNN, and MSNBC. These findings are consistent with Anxiety Uncertainty Management theory, which predicts that exposure to stressors in unfamiliar settings causes individuals to think in ethnocentric, dichotomous, stereotypical ways. Our research underscores the impact of white privilege on language, communication, and news production, and the need for cultural competence training to enhance journalists' ability to discuss racial matters with ease. © The Author(s) 2010.","African Americans; Anxiety Uncertainty Management theory; discourse semantics; Hurricane Katrina; New Orleans",,,,,,,,,"Ackerman, S., The Most Biased Name in News (2001) Extra, , http://www.fair.org/index.php?page=1067, (July/August).

The discursive, qualitative approach used here contrasts with surveys and experiments prevalent in TPE research: groups watched a news program and responded to non-directional questions in a naturalistic setting. Group members, who reported feeling better informed about current events than the average person, alternately identified themselves as invulnerable and vulnerable to media influence. Discourse analysis showed participants using the pronoun 'they' to distinguish themselves from the mass audience; however, they also used 'I', 'we' and 'you' to convey first-person and second-person perceptions, suggesting multiple and shifting identifications. This study reveals three conversational strategies - role-playing, inventing dialogue and posing hypothetical statements - through which even people who feel a sense of 'media superiority' over others imagine themselves being susceptible to mainstream news. The results, derived from a context allowing people to express mobile and conflicting identities, have implications both for communication scholarship and for social-change agents. © The Author(s) 2010.","activism; alternative media; audience studies; critical discourse analysis; focus groups; journalism; mainstream media; mass audience; media effects; news; third-person effect",,,,,,,,,"Adorno, T., Horkheimer, M., (1972) The Dialectic of Enlightenment, , New York: Herder and Herder; Andsager, J.L., White, H.A., (2007) Self versus Others: Media, Messages & the Third-Person Effect, , Mahwah, NJ: Erlbaum; Boyle, M., Media and Protest: Implications of Mainstream and Alternative Media for Student Protest Participation (2005), Paper presented at the annual international meeting for the Association for Education in Journalism and Mass Communication, San Antonio, TX, 10-13 August; Brosius, H.B., Engel, D., The Causes of Third-person Effects: Unrealistic Optimism, Impersonal Impact or Generalized Negative Attitudes towards Media Influence?

Some of these involve disaligning actions such as topic shifts, non-conforming responses, and disagreements. Others involve the presentation of views as particularly significant or sincere.

The analysis, based on aspects of adjacency sequencing, question/ response design, and narrative organization, explores the ways in which a personal account is elicited about an event that had been highly prominent in the news. However, I also look at how 'accountability' emerges as an issue during the interview, and on how the tensions between these two types of interview are played out in its design and subsequent editing. Although the interview displays many of the characteristics identified by Montgomery (2007) as 'experiential', where the interviewee is positioned as 'one of us', with knowledge and experience of an event she is not to be held accountable for as a result of her high profile in the news coverage of the Iranian hostage crisis (in April 2007), Faye Turney had already become a public figure during the time she was held in Iran. Furthermore, she had already been positioned by the media as accountable for some of her actions during her captivity. I show that the personal dimensions of the interview as interaction are framed by the interview as documentary, thus producing a hybrid form in which both the experiential and the accountable can be managed. © The Author(s) 2010.","Accountability; Emotionality; Experiential; Interview; Narrative; Public and private discourse",,,,,,,,,"Clayman, S., Heritage, J., (2002) The News Interview: Journalists and Public Figures on Air, , Cambridge: Cambridge University Press; Greatbatch, D., A Turntaking System for British News Interviews (1988) Language in Society, 17, pp. 401-430; Heritage, J., Analysing News Interviews (1985) Handbook of Discourse Analysis, 3, pp. 95-117. , in T. van Dijk (ed.)

The article presents a case study of such an interview, focusing on the ways in which the interaction between the verbal, the visual and the rhythmic modalities of the interview is employed by the multiple authors of the text to construct a variety of interpersonal footings for interviewer and interviewee on the one hand and a series of preferred interpretations for the audience on the other. The method is deviant case analysis, using tools from semantics and pragmatics, discourse and conversation analysis, and visual analysis of news images. To explore the manner of interaction between the verbal and visual channel, the concept of rhythm is developed for dialogic audiovisual texts. Dialogic audiovisual rhythm is defined as arising from the interaction of speaker or addressee change with onset of new shot, and with frequency of shots per turn/ generic unit of the interview. Rhythmic sequences can then be segmented which make up the textual structure of the interview, delineating its semantic units and areas of strategic positioning between the private, the personal and the political. Three types of the personalization of politics can be discerned in the text: that of the private domain, that of political relations as private ones, and that of politics as history being made by great men. A forth type of personalization is that of the relations between the media and politics. Different combinations of verbal, visual and rhythmic means are used to realize these types discursively. © The Author(s) 2010.","Audiovisual rhythm; Audiovisual rhythm of interviews; Multimodality; Personalization of politics; Political talk show interview; Pragmatic potential of audiovisual rhythm",,,,,,,,,"Barthes, R., (1977) Image, Music, Text, , London: Fontana; Bell, P., van Leeuwen, T., (1994) The Media Interview: Confession, Contest, Conversation, , Kensington, NSW: New South Wales Press; Blum-Kulka, S., The Dynamics of Political Interviews (1983) Text, 3 (2), pp. 131-153; Burke, P., (1992) The Fabrication of Louis XIV, , New Haven, CT: Yale University Press; Clayman, S., News Interviews Openings - Aspects of Sequential Organization (1991) Broadcast Talk, pp. 48-75. , in P.

Without losing sight of the analytical-critical-reflexive moments that have typified discourse analytical endeavours, this article explores a form of DA that moves from discourse as object to be collected and processed away from where it is practised, towards discourse as dynamically emerging reality shared by (clinical) practitioner-participants and researchers, and as flexible means to intervene in the quality and safety of care practices. The article begins with highlighting the productive potential of discourse research in health. The ethics informing this mode of DA, the article goes on to explain, is interested and trustful 'entanglement' with those who populate this field of practice and structure it with discourse. Elsewhere referred to as 'experience-based enquiry', the initiative to reframe discourse research as a mode of intervention involves keeping practitioners' interpretations and analysts' questions, critiques and conclusions in tension. The article argues that this approach capitalizes on the intrinsically reflexive, dialogic and emergent nature of discourse. To illustrate these issues, the article presents two case studies drawn from recent projects that have manifested these researcher and practitioner-participant dynamics. The article concludes that, as emergent practice, the analysis of discourse benefits from entanglement with the people and the contexts where discourse is produced. Here, analysis vacillates between a feedback device that enables both research participants and researchers to re-appraise their and each other's practices, and a knowledge production device that generalizes about these practices and the changes to these practices that result from the research. © The Author(s) 2010.","Emergence; Entanglement; Feedback; Reflexivity; Video ethnography",,,,,,,,,"Baker, G.R., Norton, P., (2004) Patient Safety and Healthcare Error in the Canadian Healthcare System: A Systematic Review and Analysis of Leading Practices in Canada with Reference to Key Initiatives Elsewhere, , Ottawa: Health Canada; Barthes, R., (1978) A Lover's Discourse: Fragments, , New York: Hill and Wang; Bauman, Z., (2000) Liquid Modernity, , Cambridge: Polity Press; Berry, M., Systemic Linguistics and Discourse Analysis: A Multi-Layered Approach to Exchange Structure (1981) Studies in Discourse Analysis, pp. 120-145. , in M.

The focus is on a particular kind of new, multisemiotic news story genre that appears regularly in this newspaper, and that makes use of word-image play. Using a social semiotic framework and employing Appraisal theory, we analyse a corpus of 40 stories in terms of evaluative meanings in heading, image and caption, and interpret the significance of our findings in terms of both Critical Discourse Analysis and Positive Discourse Analysis. In particular, we question whether the playing with environmental stories in the news, and the resulting clash between the humorousness of the play and the seriousness of the reported environmental event, is good or bad practice. With its multisemiotic focus, this article aims to make a significant and innovative contribution to the emerging field of ecolinguistics, and the development of Appraisal theory. © The Author(s) 2010.","Allusion; Appraisal; Corpus; Critical discourse analysis; Ecolinguistics; Environmental reporting; Positive discourse analysis",,,,,,,,,"Armstrong, D.T., Literary Allusions (1945) English Journal, 34 (4), pp. 218-219; (2007) Language, Ecology and Society: A Dialectical Approach, , Bang, J., Door, J., Steffensen, S. and Nash, J.

In particular, communications for purposes of financial disclosure have evolved from traditional written reports or oral presentations to new ICT-driven forms. This study describes the generic profile of earnings calls, that is, conference calls during which company executives present periodic financial results to investment analysts connected via telephone and the Internet. A qualitative discourse analysis performed on the transcripts of 20 earnings calls revealed a rather consistent structural patterning, as well as evidence of intertextuality and interdiscursivity that shows how the financial community has shaped its own distinctive communicative practices. For additional interpretive insights, a professional informant from the financial sector was consulted. These findings enhance our understanding of a spoken genre that is destined to play an increasingly important role in corporate financial disclosure. © The Author(s) 2010.","corporate discourse; earnings calls; financial disclosure; interdiscursivity; intertextuality; rhetorical strategies; structural moves; teleconferencing",,,,,,,,,"Askehave, I., Ellerup Nielsen, A., (2004) Web-Mediated Genres.

Data analyzed were gathered within the framework of a year-long EU research pilot project aimed at developing a cost-effective methodology to comparatively analyze print media content from six EU member states (FRA2-2007-3200-02-NP-02, 2008). Within the paradigm of CDA and drawing on Appraisal Theory (Martin and White, 2005), we analyzed the writer's use of different types of reported speech, the corresponding reporting verbs, the endorsement of the reported voices, and the attitudes and emotions that these denote. Results show some significant differences in the way immigrants' voices are reported in Spanish broadsheets and freesheets. While the stories from the broadsheets depict voices of human suffering, freesheets articles show a different immigrant voice: one which is confident, successful, and well-adapted to the host environment. © The Author(s) 2010.","immigrants; news discourse; quoting patterns; Spanish broadsheets and freesheets",,,,,,,,,"(2008) Estudio de Medios para Inmigrantes, , http://www.acpi-emi.com/resumen_emi2008ok.pdf, Available at, ACPI - Asociación para el Población Inmigrante, (May-June 2008); Aimc, (2007) Estudio general de Medios, , http://www.aimc.es/aimc.php?izq=egm.swf&op=cuatro&pag_html=si&dch=02egm/24.html, Available at; Bakhtin, M.M., (1981) The Dialogic Imagination, , Austin, TX: University of Texas Press; Bañón, A.M., (2002) Discurso e Inmigración.

This article examines a major strand of news interviewing which it identifies as 'experiential' and argues, on the basis of close discourse analysis of interviews drawn from coverage of the 2008 Beijing Olympics and the 2005 London bombings, that the focus on personal experience and emotion in them is managed in ways quite distinct from accountability interviewing. Indeed, the apparently formulaic quality of the verbal performance in these interviews gives shape to experience in a fashion close to ritual but demands a quite different kind of alignment from the audience than that implicated by accountability interviewing. © The Author(s) 2010.","Adversarialism; Broadcast news; Discourse analysis; Fourth Estate; Narrative; Personal experience; Public sphere; Sporting news; Television news; Verbal ritual; Witnessing",,,,,,,,,"Allan, S., (2004) News Culture, , Maidenhead: Open University Press; Becker, K., Media and the Ritual Process', Media (1995) Culture & Society, 17, pp. 629-646; Blum-Kulka, S., The Dynamics of Political Interviews (1983) Text, 32, pp. 131-155; Bull, P.E., On Identifying Questions, Replies and Non-replies in Political Interviews (1994) Journal of Language and Social Psychology, 13, pp. 115-131; Bull, P.E., Equivocation Theory and News Interviews (1998) Journal of Language and Social Psychology, 17 (1), pp. 36-51; Bull, P.E., Equivocation and the Rhetoric of Modernisation: An Analysis of Televised Interviews with Tony Blair in the 1997 British General Election (2000) Journal of Language and Social Psychology, 19 (2), pp. 222-247; Bull, P.E., Mayer, K., How Not to Answer Questions in Political Interviews (1993) Political Psychology, 14 (4), pp. 651-666; Carey, J., (1989) Reportage, , London: Faber; Clayman, S., News Interview Openings: Aspects of Sequential Organization (1991) Broadcast Talk: A Reader, pp. 48-75. , in P.

The emphasis on text-external properties of genre has brought into focus the notion of interdiscursivity as distinct from intertextuality, which is primarily viewed as appropriation of text-internal resources. Drawing evidence from a number of professional contexts, this article explores the nature, function, and use of interdiscursivity in genre theory, defining interdiscursivity as a function of appropriation of generic resources across discursive, professional and cultural practices, which, it is claimed, is central to our understanding of the complexities of genres that are typically employed in professional, disciplinary, and institutional communication. © The Author(s) 2010.","Appropriation of generic resources; Arbitration practices; Corporate disclosure practices; Interdiscursivity; Professional discourse; Text-external resources",,,,,,,,,"Bakhtin, M.M., (1986) Speech Genres and Other Late Essays, , Austin: University of Texas Press; Bazerman, C., Systems of Genres and the Enhancement of Social Intentions (1994) Genre and New Rhetoric, pp. 79-101. , in A.

All 14 contributions in the data approach women's life in terms of female embodiment, challenging hegemonic expectations of bodily existence. The analysis will focus on the dynamic web of 'said' and 'unsaid' statements and explore the relative openness of the contributions to multiple ways of categorization. The analysis of the texts' orientation to difference has explored four dimensions of categorization, producing a complex differentiation of feminist voices. It contributes to the contemporary debate about the depoliticizing effects of postfeminism, arguing in favour of an ideology critique of gender relations of power. © 2009 SAGE Publications.","Female embodiment; Ideology; Intertextuality; Linguistic assumptions; Postfeminism",,,,,,,,,"Bakhtin, M., (1981) The Dialogical Imagination.

Three major discursive themes are identified, which are constitutive of this postfeminist feminine identity: 1) 'It's about me!' focuses on pampering and pleasuring the self; 2) 'Celebrating femininity' reclaims and rejoices in feminine stereotypes; and 3) 'Girling women' encourages a youthful disposition in women of all ages. The article shows that entitled femininity occupies an ambivalent discursive space, which celebrates as well as repudiates feminism, and re-installs normative gendered stereotypes. The ambivalence, it is argued, contributes to fostering a culture of post-critique, which numbs resistance and deflects criticism. For all its appearances to be pro-women, feminine entitlement based squarely on an entitlement to consume offers a rather limited and problematic vision of femininity and gender equality. © 2009 SAGE Publications.","Beauty advertisements; Consumerism; Entitled femininity; Pleasure; Post-critique; Postfeminist discourse",,,,,,,,,"Bellafante, G., (1998) It's All About Me!, , http://www.time.com/Time/magazine/article/0,9197,988616,00html, Time, 29 June; Bordo, S., (1995) Unbearable Weight: Feminism, Western Culture and the Body, , Berkeley, CA: University of California Press; (1986) Films for Women, , Brundson, C.

It identifies three different interpretative repertoires which together structure constructions of sexual relationships: the intimate entrepreneurship repertoire, organized around plans, goals and the scientific management of relationships; men-ology, in which women are instructed in how to learn to please men; and transforming the self, which calls on women to remodel their interior lives in order to construct a desirable subjectivity. The article considers each repertoire in turn, and also looks at how they work together in order to privilege men and heterosexuality. Discussion focuses in particular on the postfeminist nature of the advice, in which pre-feminist, feminist and anti-feminist ideas are entangled in such a way as to make gender ideologies more pernicious and difficult to contest. © 2009 SAGE Publications.","Discourse; Feminism; Intimacy; Magazines; Media; Postfeminism",,,,,,,,,"Baker, C.N., Images of Women's Sexuality in Advertisements: A Content Analysis of Black- and White-oriented Women's and Men's Magazines (2005) Sex Roles, 52, pp. 13-27; Ballaster, R., Beetham, M., Frazer, E., Hebron, S., (1991) Women's Worlds: Ideology, Femininity and Women's Magazines, , London: Palgrave Macmillan; Bartky, S.L., (1990) Femininity and Domination: Studies in the Phenomenology of Oppression, , New York: Routledge; Bhattacharyya, G., (2002) Sexuality and Society: An Introduction, , London: Routledge; Blackman, L., Self Help, Media Cultures and the Production of Female Psychopathology (2004) European Journal of Cultural Studies, 7, pp. 219-36; Bordo, S.R., (1993) Unbearable Weight: Feminism, Western Culture, and the Body, , Berkeley: University of California Press; Boynton, P., Enough with the Advice and Thangs: The Experience of a Critically Reflexive, Evidence-based Agony Aunt (2006) Feminist Media Studies, 6, pp. 541-6; Brown, W., Neo-liberalism and the End of Liberal Democracy (2003) Theory & Event, 7 (1). , http://muse.jhu.edu/theoryandevent, retrieved 20 July 2009 from; Carpenter, L.M., From Girls into Woman: Scripts for Sexuality and Romance in Seventeen Magazine, 1974-1994 (1998) The Journal of Sex Research, 2, pp. 158-69; Coward, R., (1984) Female Desire, , London: Paladin; Cronin, A., Consumerism and Compulsory Individuality: Women, Will and Potential (2000) Transformations: Thinking through Feminism, pp. 273-87. , in S.

The matter of analytic interest is to find out how the semiotic sign 'I' acquires its semantic property of power in the pragmatic context of doctoral supervision. The data under consideration consist of two dyadic interactions conducted respectively by a PhD candidate with her two supervisors in an American university. The data analyses reveal that professorial power may be performed in two different ways (personal and positional) in three types of communicative acts - directive, evaluative, and explanative. The findings here may have some important implications for academic supervision in terms of the relationship between language and power. © 2009 SAGE Publications.

The article argues for a critical and ecologically valid approach that articulates how discursive practices are influenced by, and in turn shape, the organizational settings in which they occur. It makes a methodological contribution using decision-making episodes of a senior management team meeting of a multinational company to demonstrate the insights that can be obtained from embedding the Discourse-Historical Approach (DHA) to Critical Discourse Analysis (CDA) within a longitudinal ethnography. The approach illuminates the latent and intricate power dynamics and range of potentials of agents, triangulating micro-level discursive strategies with macro-level historical sources and background knowledge on the social and political fields. The article also makes a theoretical contribution by demonstrating the dependency of decision outcomes on often unpredictable and subtle changes in the power-context relationship. © 2009 SAGE Publications.

Given the ongoing controversy and criticisms from local residents, it is interesting to see Wal-Mart's strategies in attenuating these risks and negative impacts. The discursive practices found here are: formulating prior citizen complaints by a neutral-sounding, legalistic language which works euphemistically or as a gloss. Citizen concerns are fitted into a problem-solution format where the solutions involve engineering technology. The Wal-Mart representatives display their expertise through describing these technological answers. Scientific documents or tests are presented which point to counter-intuitive results. They draw on a discourse of 'facts' and 'information', but use these to make arguments in support of their proposals. In addition to displaying scientific-technological expertise, they avow openness to dialogue and willingness to work with the town. The Wal-Mart representatives present themselves as both technical experts and trustworthy partners, but they also may be seen as rhetor in using facts, findings, and documents to make an argument for their project. © 2009 SAGE Publications.

However, over the same time period, the use of images in hard-news stories on its home page was remarkably consistent, both diachronically and synchronically. These hard-news images are small 'thumbnails', and are most typically close crops of faces. Their small size, their consistent and limited subject matter, and their positioning in news stories represent a new practice in hard-news reporting, and raise questions about the role they play in the multimodal story-telling practices of the newspaper, and about the discursive practices of online newspapers more generally. This article presents an analysis of these thumbnails using tools from systemic functional semiotics, and an investigation from three socio-historical perspectives (news photography, typography, and punctuation). On this basis, I argue that in the specific discursive context of the home page of the Sydney Morning Herald online during the time period studied, thumbnails function less as images and more as an expression of the expanding system of language in computer-mediated communication. © 2009 SAGE Publications.","Emoticons; Images; Multimodality; News design; News discourse; Newsbites",,,,,,,,,"Alexander, J.J.G., (1978) The Decorated Letter, , London: Thames and Hudson; Arant, M.D., Anderson, J.Q., 'Newspaper Online Editions Support Traditional Standards' (2001) Newspaper Research Journal, 22 (4), pp. 57-69; Baldry, A., Thibault, P.J., (2006) Multimodal Transcription and Text Analysis, , London: Equinox; Barnhurst, K.G., 'News Geography and Monopoly: The Form of Reports on US Newspaper Internet Sites' (2002) Journalism Studies, 3 (4), pp. 477-489; Barnhurst, K.G., Nerone, J., (2001) The Form of News: A History, , New York: Guilford Press; Barthes, R., (1977) Image-Music-Text, , trans.

This study aims to better understand the relative impact of channel of communication versus topic of communication by comparing chat about four different topics. Discourse analysis and coding for topic drift were applied to two hours of chat devoted to the topics of politics, auto racing, entertainment, and cancer support. Findings demonstrate that topic may have an effect on the coherence of chat, with discussion in the politics chat room surprisingly being more coherent than in the other rooms. This research suggests that users can sustain relatively coherent interaction on political talk, suggesting chat technology may not be an inherently problematic medium for political discourse. © 2009 SAGE Publications.","CMC; Coherence; Dynamic topic analysis; Online discussion; Political chat; Topic",,,,,,,,,"Bretz, R., (1983) Media for Interactive Communication, , Thousand Oaks, CA: SAGE; Chafe, W.L., 'Givenness, Contrastiveness, Definiteness, Subjects, Topics, and Point of View' (1976) Subject and Topic, pp. 26-56. , in C.N.

By drawing on Hunston's model of evaluation in written academic discourse, it is argued that this conversational news format serves as a vehicle for evaluation, allowing the anchorpersons and journalist panels more freedom to voice concrete views. More specifically, prime-time news is generally cast in terms of two major sub-genres, namely the debate and the structured panel discussion. These sub-genres particularly lend themselves to the performance of acts of evaluation by TV journalists. Far from merely reporting events, journalists unequivocally show that their main task is to jointly interpret reality (news events and the actions of news makers) on behalf of the viewer audience. They set about this task by explicitly encoding their personal attitudes, while directly challenging government spokespersons and policies. It is argued that, in so doing, media personalities in effect shape audience opinions. The data attest to the increasing empowerment of the Greek media, and illustrate the ways in which conversational processes bring into being the continuously evolving public sphere in contemporary Greece. © 2009 SAGE Publications.","Conversation; Conversationalization; Debate; Evaluation; Journalistic discourse; Prime-time news",,,,,,,,,"Almeida, E.P., 'A Category System for the Analysis of Factuality in Newspaper Discourse' (1992) Text, 12, pp. 233-262; Boyd, A., (2001) Broadcast Journalism.

However, the understanding of the exact ways in which national imagination becomes engrained in the narrative conventions of news reporting is still rather limited, in particular when it comes to audiovisual genres. This article aims to fill a part of this blank by examining the links between national imagination and the narrative conventions of television news. Building on existing debates about different modes of news reporting, the article distinguishes two distinct sets of narrative conventions at work in television news: one typically found in routine reporting, the other characteristic of crisis and celebratory reporting. It is argued that each of these two sets of conventions is tied to a different form of nationalism, and normally arises in a different political climate. Links between national imagination and narrative conventions vary accordingly. To demonstrate this, the article provides a comparative analysis of narrative structures in selected samples of television news bulletins broadcast in the early 1990s in the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. The concluding section reflects on the external validity of the chosen case study and surveys supportive evidence from four other relevant cases, drawn from the UK and Israel. © 2009 SAGE Publications.","Celebratory reporting; Crisis reporting; Journalistic conventions; Narrative; Nationalism; News genres",,,,,,,,,"Abu-Lughod, L., (2005) Dramas of Nationhood: The Politics of Television in Egypt, , Chicago, IL: Chicago University Press; Allan, S., (1999) News Culture, , Buckingham: Open University Press; Anderson, B., (1983) Imagined Communities: Reflections on the Origins and Spread of Nationalism, , (1991) 2nd edn.

Against this background, this article considers the ways in which two clinician-managers who work in a large metropolitan teaching hospital speak about their organizational roles. Reflecting the complexity of their part of the organization, the emergency department, the interviewees position themselves as operating at the interstice between the competing and contradictory spatial logics of locality and mobility. With their identities strongly anchored in emergency as locality, the clinician-managers intervene in the flows of meanings and resources that affect its processes in ways that require intra- and inter-organizational mobility and which are incommensurate with traditional perceptions of middle managers. In regarding the interviews as 'practical authoring' (Shotter and Cunliffe, 2003), we note our own spatial ambiguity as academic researchers interested in organizations other than our own and suggest that our insider-outsider positionings are reflected in the interviews' complex spatialities. We conclude that the interviewees' boundary-spanning and cross-spatial self-positionings are indicative of the hybrid roles that workers under NPM increasingly embody and are in contrast to traditional perceptions of how the provision and management of public service work is carried out. © 2009 SAGE Publications.","Identity; Middle management; New Public Management; Space",,,,,,,,,"Alvesson, M., 'The Play of Metaphors' (1993) Post-modernism and Organization, pp. 114-131. , in J.

In this article we examine the appropriation of self-help discourse in one of Slovenia's most influential management magazines, Manager. On the basis of a critical discourse analysis of Manager's articles, we argue that the magazine predominantly uses spiritual self-help vocabulary and accordingly transforms definitions of basic business vocabulary. It offers a spiritual self-growth discourse as a solution to any current management or social problems and in doing so supports the (neo)liberal capitalism. This discourse attempts to advise managers as to how to adapt to the new competitive business environment. It furthermore promotes the belief that solely spiritual self-growth will help managers and their business partners to resist political and economic barriers and assure the business success in times of global corporate 'survival'. © 2009 SAGE Publications.","(Neo)liberalism; Management; Media; Organization studies; Recontextualization; Spiritual self-help discourse",,,,,,,,,"Abrahamson, E., Fairchild, G., 'Management Fashion: Lifecycles, Triggers, and Collective Learning Processes' (1999) Administrative Science Quarterly, 44 (4), pp. 708-740; Askehave, I., 'If Language is a Game - These are the Rules: A Search into the Rhetoric of the Spiritual Self-help Book If Life is a Game - These are the Rules' (2004) Discourse & Society, 15, pp. 5-31; (2006) Dnevnik, p. 4. , Barometer priljubljenosti 4 June; Bleicher, K., (1999) Das Konzept Integriertes Management, , 5 th edn.

This article explores the ways in which candidates shape their talk to interact interpersonally with their interviewers, so as to construct affiliation and solidarity. Drawing on Systemic Functional Linguistics Appraisal theory, in particular its system of Attitude, this article examines a set of authentic job interviews in French, or French and English. The interview analyses are complemented by the candidates' comments on the impressions they had tried to convey and the interviewers' comments about their impressions of the candidates. The analysis identifies two strategies whereby candidates may construct affiliation and solidarity with their interviewers: expressing their enthusiasm for and interest in their work and profession, and demonstrating their professional ability. It also highlights the damaging effect of expressing negative feelings and opinions. © 2008 SAGE Publications.","Appraisal theory; Attitude; Evaluation; Impression management; Job interviews; Solidarity; Systemic Functional Linguistics",,,,,,,,,"Adelswärd, V., (1988) Styles of Success: On Impression Management As Collaborative Action in Job Interviews, , Linköping: Linköping University, Linköping Studies in Arts and Science 23; Adelswärd, V., 'Laughter and Dialogue: The Social Significance of Laughter in Institutional Discourse' (1989) Nordic Journal of Linguistics, 12, pp. 107-136; Akinnaso, F.N., Ajirotutu, C.S., 'Performance and Ethnic Style in Job Interviews' (1982) Language and Social Identity, pp. 119-144. , in J.

These interactions are between the Filipino Customer Service Representatives (CSRs) and American clients who initiate the calls to seek information, clarification, or resolution to a problem. The study draws on Appraisal theory (Martin and White, 2005) to analyse the contribution of the caller and the CSR to initiating, maintaining and adjusting the interpersonal intensity of the interaction. Findings point to a limited reliance on explicit attitude on the part of both speakers, with attitude more often implied rather than expressed explicitly. Of note, too, is the interdependence of the attitudinal choices on the part of each speaker, and the role that concessive contractors such as just, already, once, yet and actually, as well as moments of silence can play in the management of the emotive intensity. While we intend the outcomes to make a contribution to professional training in the industry, we also look beyond that context to contribute in theoretical and methodological terms to the analysis of interactions in other contexts where problems need to be resolved through talk. © 2008 SAGE Publications.","Appraisal analysis; Call centre; Concessive contraction; Interpersonal meaning; Spoken interaction; Systemic functional linguistics",,,,,,,,,"Adolphs, S., Brown, B., Carter, R., Crawford, P., Sahota, O., 'Applying Corpus Linguistics in a Health Care Context' (2004) Journal of Applied Linguistics, 1 (1), pp. 9-28; Amaratunga, D., Haigh, R., Sarshar, M., Baldry, D., 'Application of the Balanced Score-card Concept to Develop a Conceptual Framework to Measure Facilities Management Performance within NHS Facilities' (2002) International Journal of Health Care Quality Assurance, 15 (4), pp. 141-151; Antaki, C., Wetherell, M., 'Show Concessions' (1999) Discourse Studies, 1 (1), pp. 7-27; Baker, C.D., Emmison, M., Firth, A., (2005) Calling for Help: Language and Social Interaction in Telephone Helplines, , Amsterdam: John Benjamins; Berardi, L., 'Globalization and Poverty in Chile' (2002) Discourse & Society, 12 (1), pp. 47-58; Bowles, H., 'Bridging the Gap between Conversation Analysis and ESP: An Applied Study of the Opening Sequences of NS and NNS Service Telephone Calls' (2006) English for Specific Purposes, 25 (3), pp. 332-357; Brooke, C., 'Information Systems at Call Centres' (2002) International Journal of Information Management, 22, pp. 389-401; Cameron, D., 'Styling the Worker: Gender and the Commodification of Language in the Globalized Service Economy' (2000) Journal of Sociolinguistics, 4 (3), pp. 323-347; Cameron, D., (2000) Good to Talk?

Bush and Osama bin Laden - in the aftermath of 9/11 and within the ongoing 'war on terror', followed by a more detailed analysis of two political cartoon texts from the corpus - one in Arabic about Bush and the other in English about bin Laden. A rationale for the combination of semiotics and critical discourse analysis and a discussion of the nature and functions of political cartoon are provided. These are followed by a review of the relevant literature with a focus on political cartoons. The analysis, drawing upon the 'dispositive' model and the incongruity theory of humor, addresses the verbal and visual aspects of the cartoons, instances of blending, incongruity and visual metaphors therein. Some major notions in CDA, for example Van Dijk's ideological square and Chilton's (de)legitimation and proximization, are also utilized in examining the sample cartoons. The detailed analysis of the two cartoons elaborates on the salient features and generic aspects of the sample, specifically on incongruity, blending and visual metaphor, toward an understanding of the messages of the cartoons, the tools used to convey these messages and how they contribute to the ongoing war of ideological misrepresentation. © 2008 SAGE Publications.","Bin Laden; Bush; Dispositive; Incongruity and blending; Intertextuality; Political cartoon",,,,,,,,,"Agathangelou, A.M., Ling, L.H.M., 'Power, Borders, Security, Wealth: Lessons of Violence and Desire from September 11' (2004) International Studies Quarterly, 48, pp. 517-538; Ali, T., (2002) The Clash of Fundamentalisms: Crusades, Jihads and Modernity, , New York: Verso; Allan, K., Burridge, K., (1991) Euphemism and Dysphemism: Language Used As Shield and Weapon, , New York: Oxford University Press; Allan, K., Burridge, K., (2006) Forbidden Words: Taboo and the Censoring of Language, , Cambridge: Cambridge University Press; Attardo, S., (2001) Humorous Texts.

Data comprise 73 vehicle stickers collected in Lagos and Ota, between 2006 and 2007 and are analysed within the framework of the post-structuralist model of discourse analysis which views discourse as a product of a complex system of social and institutional practices that sustain its continuous existence (Derrida, 1982; Fairclough, 1989, 1992, 1995; Foucault, 1972, 1981). Results show that through stickers people define their individual and group identities within religious institutional practices. And as a means of group identification, they guarantee social security and privileges. In constructing social vision the stickers help mould the individual aspiration about a future which transcends the present. Significantly, stickers in the data also reveal the tension between Islam and Christianity and the struggle to propagate one above the other. © 2008 SAGE Publications.","Assumption; Discourse; Discursive; Practices; Religion; Stickers",,,,,,,,,"Aito, O., 'Graffiti Language as an Expression of Identity in Contemporary Nigeria' (2004) The Domestication of English in Nigeria.

Indeed the 'manifestos' usually published at the beginning of an election campaign are a study in pledges, promises and wishes that parties use to entice the electorate to vote for them. Whilst talk of the future often dominates election discourse, one aspect of the future that is largely passed over without comment is the actual make up of the result, despite the relentless publication of opinion polls results. However, towards the end of the general election campaign in the UK in 2001, the Conservative Party began to warn of the dangers of the Labour Party winning the election by a large majority. The media gave wide prominence to this event, seen as tantamount to conceding defeat to the Labour Party, though the reaction of all the main political parties was to downplay its significance. In this article, we explore the discursive manipulation of temporal relations in the 2001 election campaign, and the politicians' work in gaining political capital out of the Conservative Party 'breach' in the routine election prediction structure. © 2008 Sage Publications.","Broadcast talk; Election campaigns; Future; Media discourse; News; Political discourse",,,,,,,,,"Aristotle, (1954) The Rhetoric and Poetics of Aristotle, , trans.

Expanding on the cognitive theory of metaphor developed by Lakoff and Johnson (1980), scholars in the fields of sociolinguistics and discourse analysis have examined politicians' use of metaphorical concepts to justify policies and define events. The metaphors examined in these studies frequently have attained the status of idioms; they consequently pass unnoticed while retaining their ability to frame perspectives. However, political discourse does not limit itself to such lexicalized metaphors, but makes use of new metaphors (or new uses of existing metaphors) as well. Such uses are specifically designed to attract attention, which may become problematic if the metaphor is rejected, resulting in a classic 'failure to launch'. This article examines such a case. Through an analysis of the metaphors used to describe President Bush's military plan to increase US forces in Iraq, I explore the mechanisms by which the meanings of novel metaphors are negotiated in the political arena, and demonstrate that, although their vivid imagery can generate persuasive force in political language, this effect may backfire when they encounter resistance. © 2008 Sage Publications.","Idiom; Iraq War; Metaphor; Neologism; Political discourse",,,,,,,,,"(2007) 'Iraq: A Turning Point - With Reports from Iraq from Senators John McCain and Joseph Lieberman', , http://www.aei.org/include/event_print.asp?eventID=1146, American Enterprise Institute for Public Policy Research available online at: accessed 15 March 2007; Baker III, J.A., Hamilton, L., Eagleburger, L.S., Jordon Jr., V.E., Meese III, E., O'Connor, S.D., Panetta, L.E., Simpson, A.K., (2006) 'The Iraq Study Group Report', , http://www.usip.org/isg/iraq_study_group_report/report/1206/index.html, (co-chairs) available online at: accessed 8 March 2007; Baker, G.P., 'Quotation Marks in Philosophical Investigations Part' (2002) I', Language & Communication, 22, pp. 37-68; Baker, P., Wright, R., 'Bush Appears Cool to Key Points Of Report on Iraq: President Talks of Forming ""New Strategy ""' (2006) Washington Post, pp. A1. , 8 December; Baldwin, H.W., 'War Game Opens in Mojave Dese rt: ""Escalation"" Theory Being Studied in Maneuvers' (1964) New York Times, , 17 May; Barnes, J., 'Pentagon's Plan: More US Troops in Iraq: Boosting Presence and Aid, and an Anti-Sadr Offensive, Carry Risks but Offer the Best Path to Victory, Military Officials Say' (2006) Los Angeles Times, , 13 December; Bellantoni, C., 'Obama Joins '08 Hopefuls in Call against Troop Surge; Wants Course Change' (2007) The Washington Times, p. 8. , 1 January; Billig, M., Macmillan, K., 'Metaphor, Idiom and Ideology: The Search for ""No Smoking Guns"" across Time' (2005) Discourse & Society, 16, pp. 459-480; Blommaert, J., (2005) Discourse: A Critical Introduction, , Cambridge: Cambridge University Press; Bush, G.W., (2002) 'State of the Union Address', , http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2002/01/print/20020129-11.html, 29 January, available online at: accessed 19 March 2007; Bush, G.W., (2007) 'Address to the Nation', , http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2007/01/print/20070110-7.html, 10 January, available online at: accessed 13 January 2007; Campbell, D., (1992) Writing Security: United States Foreign Policy and the Politics of Identity, , Minneapolis, MN: University of Minnesota Press; Chilton, P., (1988) Orwellian Language and the Media, , London: Pluto Press; Chilton, P., Ilyin, M., 'Metaphor in Political Discourse: The Case of the ""Common European House""' (1993) Discourse & Society, 4, pp. 7-31; Chilton, P., Lakoff, G., 'Foreign Policy by Metaphor' (1995) Language and Peace, pp. 37-69. , in C.

However, there is mounting evidence that the pressures of communication in high stress work areas such as hospital emergency departments (EDs) present particular challenges to the delivery of quality care. A recent report on incident management in the Australian health care system (NSW Health, 2005a) cites the main cause of critical incidents (that is, adverse events such as an incorrect procedure leading to patient harm), as being poor and inadequate communication between clinicians and patients. This article presents research that describes and analyses spoken interactions between health care practitioners and patients in one ED of a large, public teaching hospital in Sydney, Australia. The research aimed to address the challenges and critical incidents caused by breakdowns in communication that occur between health practitioners and patients and by refining and extending knowledge of discourse structures, to identify ways in which health care practitioners can enhance their communicative practices thereby improving the quality of the patient journey through the ED. The research used a qualitative ethnographic approach combined with discourse analysis of audio-recorded interactions. Some key findings from the analysis of data are outlined including how the absence of information about processes, the pressure of time within the ED, divergent goals of clinicians and patients, the delivery of diagnoses and professional roles impact on patient experiences. Finally, the article presents an in-depth linguistic analysis on interpersonal and experiential patterns in the discursive practices of patients, nurses and doctors. © 2008 SAGE Publications.","Discourse; Functional linguistics; Health communication; Hospital emergency departments; Organizational studies; Spoken interactions",,,,,,"National Health and Medical Research Council",", Australian Review of Applied Linguistics 19 : 123 - 50 .

Examples, as concrete instances or events used to substantiate a wider argument, have been variedly regarded in different research traditions. Classical logic and rhetoric have considered them an inferior form of argument, useful for pedagogic or public debate but inadequate for higher forms of thought. This spirit still permeates much psychological research on communication, where the great persuasive import of examples has been contrasted with more scientific and formal resources for argumentation. Considered in this light, the contingent and episodic nature of examples seems to make them cognitively inferior to explicit statements of general rules. However, various strands of research on the nature of scientific knowledge have shown that implicit forms of knowledge are an integral part of scientific expertise. Examples may thus be more central to disciplinary thought than the conventional normative view seems to allow. In this spirit, we explore the use of examples in a hotly contested field, that of popular discourse on business and management. The profusion of examples in this kind of writing has been often noted, and almost as often criticized. We seek to explore more fully how these examples are deployed, examining the discursive devices that mark examples within the development of the text, their function as rhetorical moves, and their role in presenting arguments that are never otherwise made explicit. © 2008 SAGE Publications.","Disciplinary conventions; Exemplification; Management discourse; Postmodern management; Tacit knowledge",,,,,,,,,"Alonso, L.E., 'El discurso de la sociedad del conocimiento y el declive de la reforma social. del management del caos al caos del management' (2002) VII Congreso Español De Sociología, , in Salamanca; Alonso, L.E., Fernández Rodríguez, C.J., 'El imaginario managerial: El discurso de la fluidez en la sociedad económica' (2006) Política Y Sociedad, 43 (2), pp. 127-151; 'Rhetoric' (1984) The Complete Works of Aristotle: The Revised Oxford Translation, Volume LXXI, Tome I of Bollingen Series, , Aristotle in J.

Given this goal, this article sought to help clear the ground for such interdisciplinary development by investigating how organizational researchers use the terms 'discourse' and 'communication' and cast discourse-communication relationships. By reviewing 112 organizational discourse studies from major journals in communication, organizational studies, and interdisciplinary journals published between 1981 and 2006, this study identified diverse conceptualizations of these basic concepts. The findings help dispel some of the misunderstandings that scholars from one research field may possess toward the other and sort through some, if not all, the confusions regarding the terms 'discourse', 'communication', and their relationships. © 2008 SAGE Publications.","Communication; Discourse; Discourse analysis; Organizational communication; Organizational discourse",,,,,,,,,"Acker, J., 'Hierarchies, Jobs, Bodies: A Theory of Gendered Organizations' (1990) Gender & Society, 4, pp. 139-158; Alvesson, M., Kärreman, D., 'Varieties of Discourse: On the Study of Organizations through Discourse Analysis' (2000) Human Relations, 53, pp. 1125-1149; Anderson-Gough, F., Grey, C., Robson, K., 'In the Name of the Client: The Service Ethic in Two Professional Services Firms' (2000) Human Relations, 53, pp. 1151-1174; Austin, J.L., (1962) HoW to Do Things With Words, , Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press; Axley, S.R., 'Managerial and Organizational Communication in Terms of the Conduit Metaphor' (1984) Academy of Management RevieW, 9, pp. 428-437; Ball, K., Wilson, D.C., 'Power, Control and Computer-based Performance Monitoring: Repertoires, Resistance and Subjectivities' (2000) Organization Studies, 21, pp. 539-565; Banerjee, M., Capozzoli, M., McSweeney, L., Sinha, D., 'Beyond Kappa: A Review of Interrater Agreement Measures' (1999) Canadian Journal of Statistics, pp. 223-273; Barge, J.K., Fairhurst, G., 'Living Leadership: A Systemic Constructionist Approach' Leadership, , (in press); Berger, P., Luckman, T.L., (1966) The Social Construction of KnoWledge: A Treatise on the Sociology of KnoWledge, , Garden City, NY: Doubleday; Boden, D., (1994) The Business of Talk: Organizations in Action, , Cambridge: Polity; Boje, D., 'The Storytelling Organization: A Study of Story Performance in an Office Supply Firm' (1991) Administrative Science Quarterly, 36, pp. 106-126; Brown, A.D., Coupland, C., 'Sounds of Silence: Graduate Trainees, Hegemony and Resistance' (2005) Organization Studies, 26, pp. 1049-1069; Burke, K., (1969) A Grammar of Motives, , Berkeley: University of California Press.

The purpose of the article is to delineate this communicative phenomenon, which we call moral muting. Moral muting occurs when a message either blunts the moral considerations involved in a case or presents an equivocal moral meaning. Moral muting overlaps with but is distinct from mitigation, and even when it involves mitigation, moral muting depends on devices that go beyond those generally associated with conversational mitigation. The examination of moral muting offered here contributes to a better understanding of moral communication in general and of the conduct of the American public sphere. © 2008 Sage Publications.","Editorials; Ethics; Iraq; Mitigation; Moral discourse; Morality",,,,,,,,,"Ackerman, B., 'The Legality of Using Force' (2002) NeW York Times, p. 15. , 13 September; Ardener, E., 'The ""Problem"" Revisited' (1975) Perceiving Women, pp. 19-27. , in S.

To address this issue, this article proposes a conceptual model to study cross-cultural discursive competence exhibited in individual interactions in business settings. The model is based on relational empathy and genre theories and, in particular, it develops the notional concepts of 'cultural space' and 'text reconstruction' that stress a two-way cultural adaptation underpinned by building relational empathy and intercultural alliances. In addition, the study proposes that the triangulation of cultural, institutional and sociocognitive spaces is the key to understanding and interpreting text reconstruction as a dynamic process of two-way cultural adaptation. The three-space model is exemplified through an analysis of cross-cultural interactions that occurred at a business negotiation meeting. © 2008 Sage Publications.","Cross-cultural discursive competence; Cultural space; Text reconstruction",,,,,,,,,"Adair, W.L., Brett, J.M., 'The Negotiation Dance: Time, Culture, and Behavioural Sequences in Negotiation' (2005) Organization Science, 16 (1), pp. 33-51; Allan, B.J., Broome, B.J., Jones, T.S., Chen, V., Collier, M.J., 'Intercultural Alliances: A Cyberdialogue among Scholars-Practitioners' (2003) Intercultural Alliances: Critical Transformation, pp. 249-319. , in M.J.
