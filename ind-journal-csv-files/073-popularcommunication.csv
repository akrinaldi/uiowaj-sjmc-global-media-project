Part of this NDA stipulates that they will pay a 500,000 USD penalty for every instance in which they disclose information about the show’s business practices. In this paper, I present NDAs as a mechanism used in reality television, and throughout society, for powerful wealthy interests to silence subordinates. To do this I use the case study of The Voice to demonstrate how the show conceals precarious and exploitative labor practices. Most of the current literature on NDAs is located in Business disciplines and focuses on the business benefits of having employees sign NDAs. This paper intervenes in this literature from a sociological perspective by exploring NDAs as social institutions deployed by the Culture Industry to exploit the labor of cultural workers. © 2020, © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Intellectual property; law; law and policy; media economics; media industries; political economy of communication; popular music; reality TV; television; work and labor",,,,,,,,,"Abidin, C., (2018) Internet celebrity: Understanding fame online, , England, UK: Emerald Publishing Limited; Arditi, D., (2014) iTake-over: The Recording industry in the digital era, , Lanham, MD: Rowman & Littlefield Publishers; Armstrong, M., CBS Sues Stacey Back (2001) E!

With the aim of interrogating continuity and change in the representation of Africa, this paper explores African exoticism in Travel Channel’s Bizarre Foods with Andrew Zimmern. Framed within a critical cultural/postcolonial perspective that anchors discourses of exoticism in Bizarre Foods with Andrew Zimmern, the study identifies the spectacular representational modes of the “crude” native, poverty, and primitivism as evidences of African otherness. Key findings of the study indicate that food in many African destinations is portrayed as mere materiality, and that African foodways are unsophisticated and lack any perceptible aesthetics or influence. Furthermore, the show stubbornly insists on Africa’s “primitiveness” as a binary condition to be contrasted with Western modernity, which, like the spectacle of poverty, marks the salience of African alterity. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Africa; Bizarre Foods; commodification; culinary adventure programs; exoticism; postcolonial theory; primitivism; reality television; spectacular consumption",,,,,,,,,"Abiye, Y., Attorney general to sue Dutch company over teff patent (2018) The Reporter, , https://www.thereporterethiopia.com/article/attorney-general-sue-dutch-company-over-teff-patent, May, 19, Retrieved from; Achebe, C., An image of Africa (1978) Research in African Literatures, 9 (1), pp. 1-15; Adichie, C., (2009), https://www.ted.com/talks/chimamanda_adichie_the_danger_of_a_single_story?language=en, The danger of a single story.

Con-bloggers share desirable strategies for navigating the convention, including access to tickets, hotel rooms, and panels. I argue that con-blogging’s focus on wait times, the convention space, and communal experiences among fans functions as an adjacent yet external “extra” to the industry’s promotional discourse. The popularity of con-blogging demonstrates that fans’ interests exceed industrial offerings. Con-bloggers’ primary fandom is the ephemeral experience rooted in a specific time (four days in July) and space (the San Diego Convention Center), expanding the usual definition of fandom as centering on a media text. Even though con-bloggers’ fandom remains apart from industry buzz, they adopt industrial strategies to promote their blogs, including branding, sponsorships, and swag. The complex economy of knowledge production among con-bloggers reorients our understanding of industry-fan interactions at conventions and beyond. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","blogging; fan practices; fandom; media industry; San Diego Comic-Con",,,,,,,,,"Andersen, K., Actualized fantasy at Comic-Con and the confessions of a ‘Sad Cosplayer’ (2014) It happens at Comic-Con: Ethnographic essays on a pop culture phenomenon, pp. 91-107. , Bolling B., Smith M.J., (eds), Jefferson, NC: McFarland,.

This paper analyzes the public-facing operations: website, books, and celebrity benefit concerts, through which the David Lynch Foundation interacts with its American audience and charts two moves that the David Lynch Foundation has made in order to market TM. First, I assert that they have positioned TM as a technique rather than a spiritual practice and I understand this through Foucault’s theory of techné. Second, I argue that they have leveraged the auracular quality of celebrity as a modality through which to brand TM for the spiritual consumer. Ultimately, I made claims on how these moves represent a shift in how American spiritual seekers are understood and marketed to in popular culture. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","branding; celebrity; marketing; religion; spirituality; Transcendental meditation",,,,,,,,,"Banet-Weiser, S., (2012) Authentic TM: The politics of ambivalence in brand culture, , New York: New York University Press; Benjamin, W., The work of art in the age of its technological reproducibility [First Version] (2010) Grey Room, 39, pp. 11-37; Berger, P., (1967) The sacred canopy: Elements of a sociological theory of religion, , Garden City, NY: Doubleday; Booth, P., (2010) Digital Fandom: New media studies, , New York, NY: Lang; Campbell, C., (2007) The Easternization of the West: A thematic account of cultural change in the modern era, , Boulder, CO: Paradigm; Carrette, J., King, R., (2005) Selling spirituality: The silent takeover of religion, , New York, NY: Routledge; Cimino, R., Lattin, D., (1998) Shopping for Faith: American religion in the new millennium, , San Francisco, CA: Jossey-Bass; Cowan, D.E., Bromley, D.G., Transcendental meditation: The question of science and therapy (2008) Cults and new religions: A brief history, 48-71, , Cowan D.E., Bromley D.G., (eds), Malden, MA: Blackwell Publishing, &,.

The site’s interface is evaluated to determine its overall folksonomy-friendliness using a framework based upon an analysis of wayfinding features. Folksonomy is a social tagging strategy that exemplifies the innovation of dynamic web interfaces but is surprisingly scarce in music streaming interfaces. It can be found in sites composed of user-made content, where users categorize music in their own words. How music is organized in streaming interfaces, and whether it reflects a user’s own musical vocabulary, impacts upon a user’s access to a variety of music, their modes of interaction, and overall power dynamics, in which one path of listening may have more influence than another. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Folksonomy; music discovery; music streaming interfaces; Spotify",,,,,,,,,"Anderson, C., (2010) The long tail: How endless choice is creating unlimited demand, p. 11. , New York, NY: Random House, (p; Cairo, A., (2012) The functional art: An introduction to information graphics and visualization, p. 22. , Berkeley, CA: New Riders, (p; Eriksson, M., Fleischer, R., Johansson, A., Snickars, P., Vonderau, P., (2019) Spotify teardown: Inside the black box of streaming music, , Cambridge, MA: MIT Press; Gaffney, M., Rafferty, P., Long tail visible: Social networking sites and independent music discovery (2009) Program: Electronic Library & Information Systems, 43 (4), pp. 375-391, 377; Gensler, A., (2014) Twitter #Music pulled from app store, shutting down April 18, , http://www.billboard.com/biz/articles/news/digital-and-mobile/5944820/twitter-music-pulled-from-app-store-shutting-down-april, Retrieved from Billboard Biz; Governor, J., Nickull, D., Hinchcliffe, D., (2009) Web 2.0 architectures: What entrepreneurs and information architects need to know, p. 62. , Sebastopol, CA: O’Reilly Media, &, (p; Hagen, A.N., The playlist experience: Personal playlists in music streaming services (2015) Popular Music and Society, 38 (5), pp. 625-645; Harper, R., Rodden, T., Rogers, Y., Sellen, A., (2008) Being human: Human-computer interaction in the year 2020, , Cambridge, UK: Microsoft Research Ltd; Hogan, B., From invisible algorithms to interactive affordances: Data after the ideology of machine learning (2015) Roles, trust, and reputation in social media knowledge markets, pp. 103-117. , Bertino E., Matei S., (eds), Red., New York, NY: Springer International Publishing; Hu, C., (2016) What is “Escape Room” and why is it one of my top genres on spotify?, , https://festivalpeak.com/what-is-escape-room-and-why-is-it-one-of-my-top-genres-on-spotify-a886372f003f, December, 15, Retrieved from Festival Peak; Ingham, T., (2016) Spotify is making its own records … and putting them on playlists, , https://www.musicbusinessworldwide.com/spotify-is-creating-its-own-recordings-and-putting-them-on-playlists/, August, 31, Retrieved from Music Business Worldwide; Ingold, T., (2016) Lines: A brief history, , London, UK: Routledge; Jeorett, P., Watkinson, N., (2015) From taxonomy to folksonomy: How librarians organise things, , https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCLf5xz-Dk8, Retrieved from YouTube; Khan, I.H., Kolay, S., Study of wayfinding behaviours in an outdoor environment (2017) Research into design for communities, p. 174. , Chakrabarti A., Chakrabarti D., (eds), Singapore, Singapore: Springer, &,.

While it is well known that streaming services collect troves of data, little is known about how stakeholders, including managers or label executives, make metric-based decisions and how they understand the impact of algorithms. The article uses anonymized interviews with music industry professionals, exploring how they use metrics in streaming services and examining their decision-making processes. The analysis concludes that they rely on a growing volume of data when making decisions about what to promote, and how. Nevertheless, most of the stakeholders focused on fairly simple metrics, such as salient spikes that were noticeable “at a glance.” When discussing these findings, we draw attention to the reinforcing feedback loops between metrics, data-based decisions and algorithms, questioning whether datafication acts to intensify trending events and diffusion of new music. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

During the rapid expansion of commercial music streaming services between 2016 and 2018, musician and recording industry enthusiasm for revenue growth was tempered by trepidation surrounding change. This article presents findings from interview research conducted with Australian artists and music industry professionals to provide insight on the promotion of popular music within the often opaque blend of human and algorithmic structures inside the digital music streaming commodity. It explores the apprehension and enthusiasm over the affordances of the new recommendation and discovery ecosystems, centered around the in-house curated Spotify playlist. Debates surrounding the topics of revenue, access, and engagement are explored. Analysis will demonstrate the increasingly influential role music streaming services and recommendation tools are perceived to play in the sectors of retail, promotion, and distribution. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Australia; digital media; information society; media industries; new media; popular music; sound studies; work and labor",,,,,,,,,"Aguiar, L., Waldfogel, J., (2018) Platforms, promotion, and product discovery: Evidence from Spotify playlists, , https://ec.europa.eu/jrc/sites/jrcsh/files/jrc112023.pdf, Retrieved from; Alacovska, A., Gill, R., De-westernizing creative labour studies: The informality of creative work from an ex-centric perspective (2019) International Journal of Cultural Studies, , 1367877918821231; Albury, K., Spaceship triple J: Making the national youth network (1999) Media International Australia Incorporating Culture and Policy, 91 (1), pp. 55-66; (2019) ARIA 2018 music industry figures show 12.26% growth [Press release, , https://www.ariacharts.com.au/news/2019/aria-2018-music-industry-figures-show-12-26-growth, Retrieved from; Australia, P.O., (2019) Report on the inquiry into the Australian music industry, , https://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Committees/House/Communications/Australianmusicindustry/Report, Canberra: Retrieved from; Baym, N.K., The Swedish model: Balancing markets and gifts in the music industry (2011) Popular Communication, 9 (1), pp. 22-38; Baym, N.K., Data not seen: The uses and shortcomings of social media metrics (2013) First Monday, 18 (10); Baym, N.K., (2018) Playing to the crowd: Musicians, audiences, and the intimate work of connection, , New York: New York University Press; Bourdieu, P., (1984) Distinction a social critique of the judgement of taste, , London, UK: Routledge & Kegan Paul; Bourdieu, P., The forms of capital (1986) Handbook of theory and research for the sociology of education, pp. 46-58. , Richardson J., (ed), New York, NY: Greenwood, (R.

I begin by introducing the music scenes of Beirut, Lebanon, where I have done ethnographic research since 2015. I then lay out the importance of online modes of sociality for these musicians and their fans, focusing on social media and streaming services.

There has also been important work calling for a shift of attention away from the algorithms themselves to the actors that control them: the fundamental questions we should be asking of algorithms, after all, concern more than the specifics of code. This paper applies the arguments developed by Gillespie and Bucher to the algorithms utilised by music streaming services–the powerful but opaque curatorial systems that suggest songs to users. Although there has been important work on algorithms in the context of music streaming, this focus on music streaming remains relatively unusual. Even in the context of music streaming algorithms, our approach is also novel, in that we focus not on the possible effects upon users of music streaming platforms–that is, music fans–but, rather, on the possible effects on music creators. What, then, might be the effects upon songwriters and artists of the increasing prevalence of recommendation systems in music streaming?. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Digital media; information society; media economics; media industries; personalised playlist; popular music; recommendation system; Spotify",,,,,,,,,"Airoldi, A., Beraldo, D., Gandini, A., Follow the algorithm: An exploratory investigation of music on YouTube (2016) Poetics, 57, pp. 1-13; Ed Sheeran talks hangovers and Spotify (2015) Billboard, , https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop-shop/6738253/ed-sheeran-hangovers-spotify, October, 22, Retrieved from; Aswad, J., Spotify Reaches 87 Million paid subscribers (2018) Variety, , https://variety.com/2018/music/news/spotify-reaches-87-million-paid-subscribers-1203017004, November, 1, Retrieved from; Banks, M., (2007) The politics of cultural work.

Yet the ideas about commons articulated at the turn of the millennium by anti-capitalist movements today show signs of exhaustion and disintegration. One reason is their failure to adequately reckon with the power of the modern state and its role as an organizational hub of contemporary capitalism. Starting with a recent exchange on this topic between peer-to-peer computing theorists Michel Bauwens and Jose Ramos and political economist Graham Murdock, this paper looks back at the alter-globalist movement in which contemporary “commonism” incubated and at why such analysis often circumvented the issue of the state. The shortfall in that position is demonstrated by an examination of how deeply state power was involved in the collapse of alter-globalism, and in the rise of the platform capitalism that appropriated many of its experiments in digital commoning. The role the digital pseudo-commons created by Google, Facebook, Twitter, and other platform capitalists played in both the immediate successes and longer-term failure of occupy movements, and in the subsequent rise of neofascism and right wing populism, is reviewed. The paper then discusses how, in the aftermath of these setbacks, contending models of left populism and communizing riots mutate or repudiate earlier notions of commons. It concludes by reviewing the possibilities, positive and negative, for the relation of commonists, populists, and communards. © 2020, © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Activism; political economy of communication; politics; social change; social movements",,,,,,,,,"Albright, J., The #election2016 micro-propaganda machine (2016) Medium, , https://medium.com/@d1gi/the-election2016-micro-propaganda-machine-383449cc1fba/, November, 18, Retrieved from; (2019) Putting technology at the service of people, , http://cat/digital @BCN digital, Barcelona; Spain, Retrieved from; Bastani, A., (2019) Fully automated luxury communism, , London, UK: Verso; Bauwens, M., Ramos, J., Re-imagining the left through an ecology of the commons: Towards a post-capitalist commons transition (2018) Global Discourse, 8 (2), pp. 325-342; Bernes, J., Logistics, counterlogistics and the communist prospect (2013) Endnotes 3, , https://endnotes.org.uk/issues/3/en/jasper-bernes-logistics-counterlogistics-and-the-communist-prospect, Retrieved from; Blanc, E., Why kautsky was right (and why you should care) (2019) Jacobin, , https://jacobinmag.com/2019/04/karl-kautsky-democratic-socialism-elections-rupture, April, 2, Retrieved from; Bolton, M., Pitt, H., (2018) Corbynism: A critical analysis, , Dublin, Ireland: Emerald; Bonefeld, W., (2017) The strong state and the free economy, , New York, NY: Rowman & Littlefield; Bria, F., A new deal for data (2018) Economics for the many, pp. 2694-2839. , McDonnell J., (ed), London, UK: Verso.

The mobilization of the Standing Rock Sioux is perhaps the best-known example of a continent-wide cycle of resistance in which Indigenous communities have employed a combination of collectively governed land-based encampments and sophisticated trans-media assemblages to challenge the further enclosure of their territories by the state and fossil fuel industries and instead represent their political and media sovereignty, and prefigure a more reciprocal relationship with other humans and with nature. Although their practices of commoning resemble other radical commons projects, the contemporary Indigenous commons begs for a reassessment of the critical framework of the commons. In this article, I discuss the critical commons literature and compare it with the practices of commoning in the anti-extractivist encampments of Standing Rock. © 2020, © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","anti-colonial; Commons; communications commons; environmental justice; extra-activism; extractivism; indigenous history; indigenous media; social media; social movements",,,,,,,,,"Allard, L.D., Why do we punish Dakota pipeline protesters but exonerate the Bundys?

However, in 2019, the Ethiopian House of Representatives passed the Communications Service Proclamation, a historic bill that deregulated the Ethiopian telecommunications sector, paving the way for domestic and foreign companies to invest in one of the last remaining state-controlled telecommunications markets in the world. By probing the limitations of Ethiopia’s monopolistic arrangement in telecommunications akin to state vanguardism as well as critically examining the potential pitfalls of the impending liberalization of the sector and privatization of the sole telecommunication operator Ethio-Telecom, this article makes the case for instituting a commons-based approach that is pro-poor, pro-development, and contextually streamlined.

However, its growing organic integration into the industry, into the market and into a group of innovative forms of capitalistic competition is challenging the early interpretations of this phenomenon and, at the same time, is shedding new light on the forms that these new commons can take and on the potential role they will play in the new productive arrangements that are emerging on the frontier of the digital revolution. This article engages with these new evolutions and develops innovative approaches to this phenomenon. Specifically, it makes an original contribution in two directions. The first is by developing a new framework for analyzing the relationships between commons and markets. The framework is organized under three concepts: semi-commons, shared infrastructures and creation of ecosystems. As a whole, the framework highlights the importance of studying these new commons within hybrid combinations of regimes of property and economic appropriation. The second contribution is the development of interpretative keys for analyzing the evolution of the FOSS ecosystem. This is carried out through the experimental application of two frameworks of analysis to this phenomenon: the multi-level perspective and the theory of the techno-economic paradigms. These contributions allow us to draw conclusions regarding new directions for research and policy on FOSS and the new commons. © 2020, © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Digital Commons; free and open source software; information society; intellectual property; media economics; multi-level perspective; social change; social movements; techno-economic paradigms",,,,,,,,,"Bauwens, M., Kostakis, V., From the communism of capital to capital for the commons: Towards an open co-operativism (2014) tripleC: Communication, Capitalism & Critique, 12 (1), pp. 356-361; Benkler, Y., (2006) The wealth of networks: How social production transforms markets and freedom, , New Haven and London: Yale University Press; Benkler, Y., Commons and growth: The essential role of open commons in market economies (2013) University of Chicago Law Review, 80 (3), p. 12; Berlinguer, M., The value of sharing.

This article explores collective knowledge production networking, and self-organized community building, which are grounded on commons-based artistic intervention and political struggle. Focusing on the practices of Networks of Dispossession (2013–present), which collectively compiles publicly available data and maps the exploitative and tactically obfuscated relations of capital and power in Turkey, findings reveal an emerging way of commoning that produces situated knowledges by information artifacts, material evidence, aesthetic forms and civic resistance. Departing from Science, Technology and Society (STS) studies, the article explores and introduces a distinctive notion of commoning, which is conceptualized as paratactic commoning. © 2020, © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","commoning; Commons; control; data; obfuscation; paratactic; tactic",,,,,,,,,"Adanalı, Y.A., Aldatmaz, A., Arıkan, B., Ince, E., Gurakar, E., Ustun, Z., Zıngıl, O., (2013) Networks of dispossession: Collective data compiling and mapping on the relations of capital and power in Turkey, , http://mulksuzlestirme.org/index.en//, present, Retrieved from, &, …; Adanalı, Y.A., Gribat, N., Make the invisible visible: The networks of dispossession map Turkish urban development processes.

It does so by observing that, along with the expropriation of forests, soil, and water, voice is an essential commons expropriated as a resource, relationship, and entitlement. Considering that the preservation of the commons (in terms of resources needed for human existence) depends on dialogue and discussion, its expropriation carries for the media and communications field of study the duty of creating instances of dialogue and discussion as the most basic and necessary form of resistance. The challenge lies in imagining ways to do it when the logics of dialogue, dissent, and cooperation have been discouraged by neoliberalism. Therefore, in this paper, I will propose some options united by a common thread: understanding communication as a subversive action. © 2020, © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Commons; communicative and media practices; neoliberalism; voice",,,,,,,,,"Arancibia, J.P., Comunicación Política (2006) Fragmentos para una Genealogía de la Mediatización en Chile, , Santiago, Chile: Universidad Arcis; Arendt, H., (1998) The human condition, , Chicago: The University of Chicago Press; Barnes, P., (2006) Capitalism 3.0: A guide to reclaiming the commons, , San Francisco, CA: Berrett-Koehler Publishers Inc; Bauwens, M., Kostakis, V., Pazaitis, A., (2019) Peer to peer: The commons manifesto, , London: University of Westminster Press; Benkler, Y., (2006) The wealth of networks: How social production transforms markets and freedom, , New Haven, CT: Yale University Press; Benkler, Y., Practical anarchism: Peer mutualism, market power, and the fallible state (2013) Politics & Society, 41 (2), pp. 213-251; Birkinbine, B., Commons praxis: Towards a critical political economy of the digital commons (2018) tripleC, 16 (1), pp. 290-305; Blanco, S., La tecnocracia desaloja la política (2011) El País, , https://elpais.com/diario/2011/11/18/internacional/1321570805_850215.html, November, 18, Retrieved from; Bollier, D., (2014) Think like a commoner: A short introduction to the life of the commons, , Gabriola Island: New Society Publishers; Brown, W., (2005) Edgework, critical essays on knowledge and politics, , Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press; Brown, W., (2015) Undoing the demos: Neoliberalism’s Stealth revolution, , New York, NY: Zone Books; Cabalín, C., The conservative response to the 2011 Chilean student movement: Neoliberal education and media (2014) Discourse: Studies in the Cultural Politics of Education, 35 (4), pp. 485-498; Calderón, F., Piscitelli, A., Reyna, J., Social movements: Actors, theories, expectations (1992) The making of social movements in Latin America, pp. 19-36. , Escobar A., Alvarez S., (eds), Boulder, CO: Westview Press, &,.

Escape rooms are live-action puzzle games in which groups of participants are locked in a room and surrounded by puzzles and clues. Since at least 2017, a number of escape rooms function as franchise-branded experiences. In this paper, I highlight two such experiences, Doctor Who: Worlds Collide and Sherlock: The Game Is Now. Branded escape rooms function as sites of multiple overlapping connections between media tourism and ludic fandom, where the brand harnesses fan engagement. Playing the game allows the fan to feel closer to the text, but precludes fan transformational work, linking escape rooms to authorized tourist experiences. © 2020, © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","branding; Cult media; doctor who; escape room; fandom; game; licensing; media tourism; sherlock",,,,,,,,,"Alston, A., The promise of experience: Immersive theatre in the experience economy (2016) Reframing immersive theatre, pp. 243-264. , Frieze J., (ed), London, UK: Palgrave,.

I argue that the streamification builds on an underlying tangle of transcodes. I base this on empirical findings from a qualitative study of digital online music uses and the technologies that operate beyond the interface of streaming media. I map the typical online path of music files and exemplify the tangle of transcodes with three empirical cases and detail their meaning-making processes: 1) The most informal and tangled, when a listener is stream-ripping from YouTube. 2) The re-appropriation of informal YouTube material by a musician. 3) The more formal transcoding performed by a distributor.

Their argument for taking this perspective on Bildung builds on Heidegger’s thinking concerning technology and his notion of a step back out of metaphysics and into a thinking of what is essential in technology. Moreover, departing from both Gadamer’s and Heidegger’s thinking the authors analyze how streaming media as art as well as art within streaming media can contribute to develop the notion of an evolving Bildung. The authors, furthermore, use Spotify as an example of a streaming medium which has the possibility to change the way art is experienced, and also how an evolving Bildung can develop education into an authentic human engagement with what can be called the Other, in the broad sense of this term, and so away from instrumentalism and calculative thinking. © 2020, © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Art; Bildung; Gadamer; Heidegger; hermeneutics; Spotify; streaming media; technology",,,,,,,,,"Åker, P., Spotify as the soundtrack to your life: Encountering music in the customized archive (2017) Streaming music: Practices, media, cultures, pp. 81-104. , Johansson S., Werner A., Åker P., Goldenzwaig G., (eds), London, UK: Routledge,.

Dozens of other technology startups have promised to deliver “a Spotify for books”, “a Spotify for movies”, “a Spotify for journalism” or even “a Spotify for art”. Yet, most attempts to replicate the model has actually failed. Analyzing a large body of Swedish and US news articles from 2008–2018, this article demonstrates how the metaphor of “Spotify” has been filled with very different meaning. Not only has the early promises of relying on advertising to make consumption “free but legal” been discarded, in favor of subscription-based models. Another major trend in the development of streaming services, including Spotify, has been the shift toward curation and algorithmic recommendation systems, which has added new associations to the metaphor or “a Spotify for x”. © 2020, © 2020 The Author(s).

The practice is performed, however, by a population (i.e., parents) that is generally inclined to protect its children, raising the present research question of whether sharenting could be alternatively guided by self-presentational goals. Guided by the theoretical notion of the extended self, the present study qualitatively examines parents’ Instagram posts using constant comparative analysis to identify how parents self-present in their sharenting posts. The results identify three self-presentational categories that illustrate how parents’ social media posts that depict a parent–child relational identity may actually be intended representations of the parent’s self. Implications for theory are discussed, as well as practical implications for the appropriate management of parents’ identities in a manner that respects children’s rights and privacy. © 2020, © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","extended self; parents; self-representation; Sharenting; social media; visual analysis",,,,,,,,,"Åberg, E., Huvila, J., Hip children, good mothers–Children’s clothing as capital investment?

It demonstrates how these for-profit podcasts documenting the launching of private companies represent the culmination of longterm historical processes in the public media sector and U. S society more broadly. It argues that the leveraging of public radio expertise and capital to launch reality soundwork programs promoting for-profit media companies is symptomatic of a broader shift in American cultural towards entrepreneurship of the self. These programs, and the companies and personalities behind them, are thus emblematic of both a distinct phase in the development of podcasting as a medium and the pervasiveness of market fundamentalist ideologies in contemporary U.

The models of four U.S.-based collectives demonstrate an industry in transition and the evolving place of self, community, and publicity in contemporary soundwork. This article uses intimate soundwork and collective individualism as frames for understanding how some podcasters negotiate the tensions between the role of the collective and the individual in an ill-defined industry. In turn, the sonic aesthetics they create are symptomatic of the long-established intimacies of radio sound, the precarities of independent labor, and the increasing presence of a public process of self-discovery as creative material in digital media.

With approximately six million (11%) of the UK population now listening to podcasts in an average week, the podcast renaissance raises new questions about the relationship between cultural production, consumption and representation. This paper explores the significance of the new wave of podcasts, specifically with regards to racial politics in the UK and its potential power as an anti-racist tool. Through a series of interview and focus group discussions with black and Asian podcasters in the UK, it asks what role podcasts play in providing an alternative space for ‘communities of resistance’. These issues are examined against the dual contexts in the UK of an intensifyingly hostile environment for black and minority ethnic groups and a digital and creative sector marked by social and cultural inequalities. The article suggests that in a ‘post fact’ international climate of disinformation that bolsters populist rhetoric around minority cultural groups, podcasts have become a rare space for articulating the lived experiences of these groups, whilst also challenging broader patterns of racialized disenfranchisement, including in the creative industries. Podcasts facilitate new forms of social affiliation and anti-racism; which we analyse through Fraser’s concept of “subaltern counterpublics” to unveil the interruptive potentiality of the medium for marginalised communities seeking to make accessible alternative representations and perspectives on the relationship between race and society. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

Similar to many children of Vietnamese refugees, Tan’s knowledge of Vietnam and her family’s history contains gaps of silences created by trauma, which are often filled by non-Vietnamese American voices and pop culture. Through engaging these gaps, Second Wave aims to create sound among diasporic silences to challenge dominant narratives about Vietnamese Americans. While the podcast has several limitations due to its narrative format, Second Wave ultimately pluralizes historical narratives of Vietnamese diasporas, opening spaces for Vietnamese diasporic subjects to discuss their families’ refugee experiences. In doing so, Second Wave is a step towards encouraging quieted voices to speak up and ask questions that continue to disrupt singular narratives of the Vietnam War and its’ aftermath. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","diaspora; podcasting; public sphere; Second Wave; Vietnamese American",,,,,,,,,"Berry, R., A golden age of podcasting?

One form works along the lines of the punctual circulation of media released regularly and professionally into the public sphere. The other emphasizes media accessibility and the present moment, creating a sense of continual connection with the national public. These two representations work alongside each other within podcasting, complicating a clear division between national communities imagined through “new” and “old” media. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","listener; liveness; nation; Podcasting; public; recognition; temporality",,,,,,,,,"Abumrad, J., Krulwich, R., (2002) Radiolab, , https://www.wnycstudios.org/shows/radiolab, Retrieved from; Anderson, B.R.O.G., (1991) Imagined communities: Reflections on the origin and spread of nationalism, , London, UK: Verso; Auslander, P., (2008) Liveness: Performance in a mediated culture, , 2nd, New York, NY: Routledge, ed; Barbaro, M., (Host)., (2017) The daily, , https://www.nytimes.com/column/the-daily, Retrieved from; Couldry, N., Liveness, ‘reality’, and the mediated habits from television to the mobile phone (2004) Communication Review, 7 (4), pp. 353-361; Crisell, A., (2012) Liveness and recording in the media, , London, UK: Palgrave; Douglas, S., (2004) Listening in: Radio and the American imagination, , Minneapolis, MN: University of Minnesota Press; Favreau, J., Lovett, J., Pfeiffer, D., Vietor, T., (Hosts)., (2017) Pod save America, , https://crooked.com/podcast-series/pod-save-america/, Retrieved from; Hilmes, M., Radio and the imagined community (2012) Sound studies reader, , Taylor and Francis,.

We argue that these texts prompt the notion of childlike listening, a mode of listening that harnesses the innocence and curiosity of the child for the sake of deep discussion and interpersonal connection. This ideal listening mode is achieved through performative unplugging, whereby listening party attendees show their ability to delay gratification by turning off their phones. By unpacking the ideals constructed by the coloring book and listening party kit, we argue that the cultural values they seek to convey align with wider views about the power of podcasts to bring us together. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","adult coloring books; audio storytelling; Invisibilia; paratexts; Podcasts; unplugging",,,,,,,,,"Barber, B.R., (2008) Consumed: How markets corrupt children, infantilize adults, and swallow citizens whole, , New York, NY: Norton; Barthes, R., (1957) Mythologies, , New York, NY: Hill and Wang; Bernardini, J., The infantilization of the postmodern adult and the figure of Kidult (2014) Postmodern Openings/Deschideri Postmoderne, 5 (2), pp. 39-55; Berry, R., Podcasting: Considering the evolution of the medium and its association with the word ‘radio’ (2016) Radio Journal: International Studies in Broadcast & Audio Media, 14 (1), pp. 7-22; Berry, R., ‘Just because you play a guitar and are from nashville doesn’t mean you are a country singer’: The emergence of medium identities in podcasting (2018) Podcasting, pp. 15-33. , Llinares D., Fox N., Berry R., (eds), Cham, Switzerland: Springer,.

The hypothesis is that by analyzing cartoons we can explore the underlying moral and normative confrontations linked to current political populism in the Nordic liberal democracies, which arose during the insurgent phase of the domestic right-wing parties. In total, 60 political cartoons are analyzed by means of content categorization and visual semiotics. The most popular caricatures in the cartoons depicted the leaders of the populist parties, while the most common signifiers linked the populism in the cartoons explicitly to fascism, Nazism, nativism, and racism. In this, the cartoons differed from news journalism, reflecting the specific role of cartoons in public opinion discourse and indicating special characteristics that derive from particular political contexts and also the cartoonists’ own perspectives. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","life cycle model; moral order; Nordic countries; political cartoons; Populism; visual semiotics",,,,,,"Academy of Finland: 259393

Both frames attempt to reach the public by transcending the discursive reality. Employing well-established stylistic devices (court culture, Japanese cute), prestigious metanarratives (Japanese as nature people), and established institutional systems of tourism and governance, the frames have reached huge popularity. Yet awareness surveys indicate that people continue to consider biodiversity a matter of governmental policy rather than individual lifestyle. There has been a clear positive effect on the localities singled out for satoyama campaigns. However, it can be argued that the overall effect of celebratory framing coupled with pleasing aesthetics favors complacency and does not invite new forms of civic mobilization. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

By connecting this protest’s mobilization of this anime text as both a cultural referent and an allegorical evocation of collective political power to a wider history of anime culture in Chile, this case study illuminates intangible but powerful and largely unexamined dimensions of Japanese media’s influence in Latin American culture and the articulation of social agendas in the region. It likewise suggests in what ways similar textual trajectories and flows may be understood outside dominant Anglo-American perspectives of cross-cultural affective relationships with globally circulating media. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis.",,,,,,,,,,"Minuto a Minuto de las elecciones presidenciales 2013 - Decision Final (2013) 24 Horas, , http://www.24horas.cl/politica/decisionfinal/article984721.ece, December, 15, Retrieved from; Annett, S., (2015) Anime fan communities: Transcultural flows and frictions, , Basingstroke, England: Palgrave Macmillan; Barthes, R., (1991) Mythologies, , New York, NY: Noonday Press; Bishop, K.W., (2009) Dead Man Still Walking: A Critical Investigation Into the Rise and Fall…and Rise of Zombie Cinema, , Doctoral dissertation), University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ; Brough, M.M., Shresthova, S., Fandom meets activism: Rethinking civic and political participation (2012) Transformative Works and Cultures, p. 10); Bryce, M., Davis, J., Woods, T.J., An overview of manga genres (2010) Manga: An anthology of global and cultural perspectives, pp. 34-61. , New York, NY: Continuum, &,.

The Sinophone concept, proposed by Shih Shu-mei, highlights a very important ideological intention: anti-China-centrism. Thus, this study further investigates these filmmakers’ level of resistance to China-centrism in constructing their local identities. Based on analysis of a few films, such as South of South, Nasi Lemak 2.0, Petaling Street Warrior, Woohoo!, and Ice Kacang Puppy Love, a narrative was found, proclaiming a “from China to local” identity.

Drawing on comparative research consisting of interviews of artists in France, the United Kingdom, and the United States and textual analyses of their performances, we discuss specific motivations and diverse representational practices that aim to enact togetherness-in-difference. We discuss the potentials and risks of convivial artistic productions, which we argue produce a politics of endurance that, as Feldman has said, helps “people live better with circumstances they cannot change.”. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis.",,,,,,,"British Council: 216314572

This article explores how digital technologies interact with embodied, material experiences within the geographical location refugees are residing in. Empirical examples from ethnographic research conducted among Iraqi urban refugees, living in prolonged uncertainty in Jordan, shows how situated experiences of legal, material, and social uncertainty reinforce particular mediated socialities. Pivotal studies have shown how digital connections engender virtual home-making practices and a wide variety of connected presences. This study points to the other side of the same coin: the cultivation of “absent presence.” “Absent presence” refers to feelings—the ambivalence that experiences of prolonged displacement bring about—but also to active disengagement and affective tactics in response. These engender a further separation from the physical world where forced migrants are not deemed welcome. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Abu-Hamdi, E., Amman.

Effectively, it argues, the powerful, even iconic, imagery that the media produced and shared during the 2015 “crisis” affirmed ideological frames of incompatible difference, perpetually dividing European citizens and refugees. The article focuses on some of the fundamental elements of the 2015 crisis’s visual grammar to demonstrate how they have (re-)produced popular fears of strangeness and the need for containment and control of foreign bodies. This visual grammar, we argue, imitated and procreated recognizable representations of popular culture to exaggerate newcomers’ strangeness and incompatible difference from the national subject. On the one hand, many news media simulated zombies’ threatening strangeness in images of refugee massification; on the other, many news media images reaffirmed the decisive power of the national subject over refugees’ fate, not unlike the video game player who unilaterally controls a game and takes action when confronted by zombies. This grammar, we argue, symbolically predetermines encounters between citizens and refugees, by emphasizing their incompatible difference and newcomers’ strangeness. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Agamben, G., (1998) Homo sacer: Sovereign power and bare life, , Stanford, CA: Stanford University Press; Ahmed, S., (2000) Strange encounters: Embodied others in post-coloniality, , London, UK: Routledge; Backe, H.-J., Aarseth, E., Ludic zombies: An examination of zombieism in games (2013) Proceedings of DiGRA 2013: DeFragging Game Studies, , August, &,.

It discusses the news and entertainment consumption of Filipino nurses in London and how this figures in their imaginary of social and political bonds with refugees. Drawing on ethnographic interviews, I argue that these Filipino migrants can only articulate a compromised solidarity: one fractured between empathy with refugees and concern about what these newer arrivals might mean for settled migrants in the city. I then explain how the media contribute to this fracturing. One way is that the xenophobia in popular media content on social media leads the Filipinos to assert their difference with other migrants, including refugees. A second is that the Filipinos deploy popular media content, especially on British television, to assert that they belong to UK society more than other migrants, again including refugees. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Abbas, T., Apart: Alienated and engaged Muslims in the West (2011) Global Policy, 2 (1), pp. 125-126; Alcantara, G., Hoegsholm, F.M., Permission to work: Migrant workers in the UK (2007) In de olde worlde: Views of Filipino migrants in Europe, pp. 243-269. , Quezon City, Philippines: PMRN-PSCC,.

The celebrity actor produces familiarity, or “audibility,” for contents of the stories. Yet at the same time, the familiarity of the actor alerts the visitor to the politics of listening. The artworks therefore produce the potential for ethical listening, which requires interrogation into the privileges of the listener. The artworks produce a kind of sociality different from that of typical celebrity advocacy. Instead of being at the center of attention, the actors’ presence draws critical attention to the politics of listening. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,"Academy of Finland","This work was supported by the Academy of Finland [Remembering Migration: Memory politics of forced migration in mediated societies].",,"Andersin, M., (2017) Personal communication, , January, 18; Belfiore, E., Bennett, O., (2008) The social impact of the arts: An intellectual history, , Basingstoke, UK: Palgrave; Bickford, S., (1996) The dissonance of democracy: Listening, conflict and citizenship, , London, UK: Cornell University Press; Breitz, C., (2018) Personal communication, , August, 3; Breitz, C., Why I’m sabotaging my own work (2017) Wilson Must Go.

With selfie activism, the campaign expanded the “space of appearance” and introduced new voice and visuality to the public debate. The case depicts politics of claiming citizenship and social value through self-presentation to counter views of refugees as economic burden, noncitizens, and surplus humanity. The empirical material is based on analysis of the Facebook and Twitter campaign and interviews with the participants. It is argued that selfie activism may occasionally, through new voice and visibility, expand the space of appearance and contribute to the rise of affective or counter-publics that can come together and make use of digital media for political action. However, the case also reveals how difficult it is to speak from a refugee position without being drawn into the discourse of deservingness. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis.",,,,,,,"Academy of Finland: 295948

Populist and eccentric, the protagonist Odorico Paraguaçu embodies gestures, spoken gags, unfilled promises, and other typical characteristics of Brazilian politicians. This article analyzes how the most recent cinematic version of the play staged a character who was born in the 1960s, became a television soap opera hit in the 1970s, starred a movie in the 2000s, and comes back to life in every election period. We intend to make clear that much of what was criticized in Brazilian politics then is still very much alive today. The characteristics that make Odorico laughable are described in the article and are the same ones that highlight aspects of Brazilian political culture, all played out in a lighthearted comedy of manners spiced with political satire. This article introduces the latest version of O Bem Amado with some important background information. Based on scenes extracted from the film, popular comedy is portrayed as an opportunity for the public to take revenge, through mockery, of those who take advantage of their public position in favor of private interest. The article also explores added dimensions of the most recent version, brought on by new technological aspects added when the story was adapted for the big screen. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis.",,,,,,,,,,"Acselrad, M., (2009) Rir por quê?

This study is timely for demographic reasons (a rapidly aging Indian population) and for the centrality of mega-serials to India’s entertainment landscape, coupled with the genre’s long history of engaging global audiences with real-world social issues. Two data sources are utilized: focus groups with 16 mega-serial viewers and interviews with 25 members of the Tamil mega-serial industry. Situated in scholarship on gerontology/age studies and media/culture industry studies, analysis yields two broad themes related to (a) representations of age/aging and elder-oriented storylines in contemporary Tamil mega-serials and (b) recent industry changes that may forestall mega-serials’ potential to center age and aging as core narrative elements. Overall, evidence points to an industry and audience(s) in considerable transition. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis.",,,,,,,"University of Miami","This research was funded by the Committee on Faculty Research at Miami University and the Department of Sociology & Gerontology at Miami University.",,"Anitha, K., Socio, economic and cultural impact of soap operas on home makers (a study in Andhra Pradesh) (2014) Journal of Mass Communication and Journalism, 4 (4); Anuradha, M., A study on the preference for Tamil dubbed Hindi serials among home makers in Salem (2017) International Journal of Scientific & Engineering Research, 8 (6), pp. 2286-2291; Bajaj, V., In India, the golden age of television is now (2007) New York Times, , http://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/11/business/yourmoney/11india.html?_r=1, February, Retrieved from; Banerjee, M., Paul, N.W., Oro-Piqueras, M., Wohlmann, W., Aging beyond the rhetoric of aging (2016) Serializing age: Aging and old age in TV series, pp. 269-272. , Transcript Verlag, &,. &, (Eds.), ().

Much research on film tourism focuses on one-time encounters, but fans of The Prisoner have been visiting and revisiting Portmeirion regularly for over 50 years, potentially developing a different sort of relationship with it. Based on interviews with 16 long-term fans of The Prisoner and participatory observation on site, we develop the concept of the “fan homecoming,” a return visit to a familiar fandom-related place, and show how this relationship with place can shape long-term fandom. In facilitating repeated and ritualized practices, being able to regularly gather with other fans, and providing a “safe vault” for the fandom and its memories, place is shown to have an integral role. © 2018, © 2018 The Author(s).

I argue that the audiences reflexively negotiate localization strategies of the advertising agency to articulate three different strata of cultural proximity: national, global, and subcultural. The reception that demonstrates cultural hybridity, in which the antinomy between the global and the local/national resolves, is created through the multilayered structure and the multiplicity of cultural proximities in advertising adaptations. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis.",,,,,,,,,,"Abu-Lughod, L., (2005) Dramas of nationhood: The politics of television in Egypt, , Chicago, IL: University of Chicago Press; Anderson, B., (1983) Imagined communities: Reflections on the origins and spread of nationalism, , London, UK: Verso; Apte, M., (1985) Humor and laughter: An anthropological approach, , Ithaca, New York: Cornell University Press; Atalaysun, M., (2013) Snack sector brief.

Streaming lore is a re-articulation of existing industry lore accompanying the advent of streaming technology and distribution. Contemporary streaming acts as a site of rupture, wherein industry discourses related to digital media are rendered visible. The article proposes three categories of emergent streaming lore and analyzes their relation to a growing streaming media industry.

Self-branding has become an everyday routine among journalists, but the very limited scholarship on journalistic branding on social media has largely focused on national or local journalists in single democracies, ignoring foreign correspondents, who traditionally enjoy more professional autonomy but are going social under the challenges in the age of social media. This study looks at how foreign correspondents in China, with a heavily regulated and censored social media environment, use Twitter for journalistic branding, and examines the dynamics of this branding. The Twitter profiles of 129 China correspondents and 1,249 of their tweets were content analyzed, with the findings suggesting that foreign correspondents in China use Twitter primarily for broadcasting rather than networking. They also emphasize organizational identity much more than personal one. The implications of those findings and the extent to which they might be specific to China are discussed. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,"University Grants Committee, UGC: HKBU 12406814","This work was supported by the Research Grants Council, University Grants Committee [HKBU 12406814].",,"Aaker, D.A., (2012) Building strong brands, , Simon and Schuster,.

In parallel, the rise of hypercompetition in the media industry raises questions about the increasing importance of market considerations. Under these conditions, journalists gradually develop promotional practices online. This article examines the scope of these promotional practices among political journalists on Twitter through a content analysis of messages posted by members of the Press Gallery of the Quebec National Assembly. It also analyzes motivations and norms related to these practices through a series of interviews with Press Gallery members. The findings indicate that promotion is an important feature of the production of Quebec parliamentary press on Twitter. The quest for visibility, competition, and the requests made by management teams in a context of economic hardship are key motivations for using Twitter as a promotional device. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,"Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada, SSHRC: 752-2015-1767","This work was supported by the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada [Grant number 752-2015-1767].",,"Anderson, C.W., Between creative and quantified audiences: Web metrics and changing patterns of newswork in local US newsrooms (2011) Journalism, 12 (5), pp. 550-566; Bazeley, P., Analysing qualitative data: More than identifying themes (2009) Malaysian Journal of Qualitative Research, 2 (2), pp. 6-22; Bicchieri, C., Muldoon, R., Zalta, E.N., Social norms (2014) The Stanford encyclopedia of philosophy, , http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2014/entries/social-norms/, Spring 2014, &,.

This is particularly evident in social media spaces, where regulations from news organizations remain murky and audience expectations for engagement continue to grow. These studies, which relied heavily on content analyses and large-scale surveys, have demonstrated fundamental shifts in the norms journalists use to guide their practice, while also suggesting that journalists may be searching for ways to periodically disengage from social media. Drawing on interviews with 39 American and Australian journalists, this study explores drivers of what we consider to be a rising identity dilemma among journalists and why social media disengagement is considered a possible solution. The findings suggest journalists are grappling with issues of personal and professional identity construction across social media platforms with organizational pressures to present a more professional appearance without room for periodic disengagement from social media. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis.",,,,,,,,,,"Baym, N., The new shape of online community: The example of Swedish independent music fandom (2007) First Monday, 12 (8). , http://firstmonday.org/issues/issue12_8/baym/index.html, Retrieved January10, 2008, from; Baym, N., (2015) Personal connections in the digital age, , Cambridge, UK: Polity Press; Bossio, D., Sacco, V., Don’t tweet this!

The challenge for journalists is to meet both one’s own media employer’s and the public’s expectations. Some journalists, designated in this article as “nonrepresentative,” apply a “disclaimer strategy” by mentioning the formula My tweets are my own in their profiles. In this article, we propose to compare the use of Twitter between these journalists and those who do not employ this kind of formula through a content analysis of their tweets. Results reveal four common types of journalists’ branding: corporate branding, professional self-branding, institutional branding, and personal self-branding. We show that nonrepresentative journalists are mainly using Twitter in a professional way. Like representative journalists, they normalize their messages, even if they diffuse more personal life content. These findings suggest that journalists behave as a homogeneous group on Twitter, despite the “disclaimer strategy” they may use. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis.",,,,,,,,,,"Aaker, D.A., (2003) Building strong brands, , New York, NY: The Free Press; Agrawal, J., Kamakura, W.A., The economic worth of celebrity endorsers: An event study analysis (1995) Journal of Marketing, 59 (3), pp. 56-62; Antheaume, A., (2013) Le journalisme numérique [Digital journalism], , Paris, France: Les Presses de Sciences Po; Arruda, W., Dixson, K., Build your brand in bits and bytes (2007) Report N° 40.04, , http://changethis.com/manifesto/40.04.BuildYourBrand/pdf/40.04.BuildYourBrand.pdf, Retrieved from ChangeThis website; Artwick, C.G., Reporters on Twitter.

Fans critique both the text (novels and TV show) and other fans’ interpretations of the text, as well as parallel real-world history with the world and characters of the series. Tensions arise around the “historical accuracy” of the novels and show, along with the role that dominant narratives and cultural norms play in interpreting a past that never was through the lens of a real-world past. Fantasy and history intersect in layered ways and are used by fans to support a variety of textual points of view. Issues of violence, presentism, colonialism, gender, and “historical truths” are argued in relation to the ahistoricism or historicism of the novels/show. © 2018 Taylor & Francis.","Fandom; fantasy; Game of Thrones; historical poaching; history; online discussions; social media; television; textual poaching; Tumblr",,,,,,,,,"Baym, N.K., (1999) Tune in, log on: Soaps, fandom, and online community, , Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage; Becker, C., Presidential address: Everyman his own historian (1931) American Historical Review, 37 (2), pp. 221-236; Bennett, L., Booth, P., (2016) Seeing fans: Representations of fandom in media and popular culture, , New York, NY: Bloomsbury Publishing USA, &, (Eds; Bernstein, A., Interview: Game of thrones creator George R.

Celebrity games are a form of hypertrophic media, based on the dyadic interactions between the player and celebrity. Within this, one becomes a looking-glass celebrity—an enculturation process by which the celebrity text situates the player as closer to the titular star than the player actually is. In turn, the player uses this position to reflexively construct what the player believes constitutes a successful celebrity.

A great number of these have been by women who narrated sexual political violence. However, while there has been work done on the relation between terror, trauma, and spectacle in postdictatorial television shows, rarely has this also included a gendered perspective. In this article we seek to open this area of discussion by evaluating the manner in which women’s televised testimonies of political sexual violence have been constructed on late night talk shows in Chile, using recent history and memory theory, as well as feminist theory on the representation of sexual violence in mass media. © 2018 Taylor & Francis.",,,,,,,"Inicio11130088","This work was supported by the (Fondecyt de Inicio11130088).",,"Agger, I., Jensen, S., (1997) Trauma y cura en situaciones de terrorismo de estado, , Santiago, Chile: ILAS/CESOC; Alcoff, L., Gray, L., Controlling our own words: Survivors of sexual violence speak out (1992) Off Our Backs, 22 (4), pp. 10-12; Atencio, R., A prime time to remember: Memory merchandising in Globo’s Anos Rebeldes (2011) Accounting for violence: The memory market in Latin America, , Bilbija K., Payne L., (eds), Durham, NC: Duke University Press,.

Two recent examples—the Museo de la Memoria y los Derechos Humanos 2016 exhibit Expolio, and Alexander Sokurov’s 2015 film-essay, Francofonia—highlight the need for a larger conversation regarding the way accumulation and loss of cultural products uphold or denigrate human dignity, a concept that is not often thought of in relation to the assets of art museums. Using the historical frames set out by these examples, which span from the opening of the Louvre to the plundering of cultural artifacts in Syria, I argue that dignity has always been an asset of museums. It is through the merging of dignity and memory, in the context of art and culture, that the emerging field of human rights museology can begin to speak more broadly to art history and memory studies alike. © 2018 Taylor & Francis.",,,,,,,,,,"Anker, E.S., (2012) Fictions of dignity: Embodying human rights in world literature, , Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press; Arnold-De Simine, S., (2013) Mediating memory in the museum: Trauma, empathy, nostalgia, , New York, NY: Palgrave Macmillan; Azoulay, A., ’The Family of Man’: A visual declaration of human rights (2013) The human snapshot, , Keenan T., Zolghadr T., (eds), Berlin, Germany: Sternberg Press,.

I look in particular in this article at their activist role in the process of documenting human rights abuses in contemporary film projects that explore the aftermath of genocide. In Asia, we can find two examples: the anticommunist genocide in Indonesia in 1965–66 and the genocide perpetrated by the Khmer Rouge regime in Cambodia in 1975–79. Two contemporary filmmakers have produced works that recover the history of the atrocities: Joshua Oppenheimer and Rithy Panh. Traditionally, filmmakers have formed relationships only with victims; however, this article shows how the involvement of the perpetrators is also necessary to fully understand the conflict. This article explores why filmmakers decide to engage with the perpetrators, how they get them to participate, and what the consequences of this process may be. Since Oppenheimer’s involvement with his protagonist, Anwar Congo, in The Act of Killing (2012) turns out especially problematic, exploring this relationship in depth is the central purpose of this article. © 2018 Taylor & Francis.",,,,,,,"Arts and Humanities Research Council, AHRC","8The other co-editor was Joram ten Brink, a professor at the University of Westminster.

It describes how the film’s commercial success led to an effort by Google to produce images of the island’s built environment using digital navigation technologies. It further describes how this effort led the Japanese government to include Hashima Island in a bid to gain Unesco heritage status for Meiji-era sites of industrialization. Drawing from visual studies, critical media studies, and from interdisciplinary approaches to collective memory, this article analyzes how the circulation of images depicting Hashima Island in popular culture affects continuing efforts to hold Japan accountable for injustices committed there in the past. By narrowing on the moment “after” Skyfall, the article concludes with an assessment of the island’s Google Street View archive in terms of its broader impact on the uses of navigation, spatial presence, and digital heritage. © 2018 Taylor & Francis.",,,,,,,,,,"Akagawa, N., Smith, L., (2009) Intangible heritage, , London, UK: Routledge; Beasley, W.G., (1972) The Meiji restoration, , Stanford, CA: Stanford University Press; Benjamin, W., (2002) The Arcades project, , 3rd ed., Trans.

The data come from 100 Voices: Survival, Memory, Justice. Through a thematic and visual analysis of a sample of video clips posted on YouTube, this study argues that 100 Voices is a work of postmemory that stands at the intersection of prevailing ethno-nationalist constructions of Armenian identity on the one hand, and universal discourses of human rights and historical justice, on the other.

The worldwide growth of memory sites suggests space crystallizes memory into stable formations. However, rather than monolithic discourses, environments attest to complex processes of memorialization and willful amnesia. I propose that research-led filmmaking can draw out spaces’ heterogeneous “stories in waiting.” Through the documentary After Trujillo, which revisits memory sites and ruins of Rafael Trujillo’s dictatorship from 1930 to 1961 in the Dominican Republic, I assess how working at the interface between research and film can (a) probe space’s testimonial capacity; (b) engage audiences in public debates about violent pasts; and (c) stimulate sustainable discussions through online platforms. Given that films still lack recognition as academic outputs, at stake here is the claim that creative methodologies constitute “a form of research” and “detectable research outputs.”. © 2018 Taylor & Francis.",,,,,,,,"Compared to conventional print and online publications, research-led films have much less recognition as academic outputs; hence funding bodies do not necessarily cover costs incurred in their production. To confront this situation, we developed resourceful strategies to minimize costs, such as working with a skeleton team, using minimal technology, and sharing the tasks of production and directing. The decision to make After Trujillo a nonprofit, open access film, with a Creative Commons license, facilitated relations with partner institutions that provided archival photographs and documents free of charge. A grant awarded by a private cultural foundation covered the cost of sound editing, while the production of DVDs (to donate to partner institutions in acknowledgment of their generosity in the provision of archival materials) was funded by the host university.",,"Álvarez, J., (1994) In the time of the butterflies, , New York, NY: Algonquin; Andermann, J., Expanded fields: Postdictatorship and the landscape (2012) Journal of Latin American Cultural Studies, 21 (2), pp. 165-187; Andermann, J., Between the archive and the monument: Memory museums in postdictatorship Argentina and Chile (2015) International Handbook of Museum Studies: Museum Transformations, 1, pp. 181-206; (2016) The AHRC research in film awards 2016, , http://www.ahrc.ac.uk/funding/opportunities/archived-opportunities/rifa-2016/, Retrieved from; Assmann, J., Collective memory and cultural identity (1995) New German Critique, 65, pp. 125-133; Bell, V., (2014) The art of post-dictatorship: Ethics and aesthetics in transitional Argentina, , London, UK: Routledge; Blackmore, L., Violencia en el jardín de (la) Patria: La monumentalización de las hermanas Mirabal y el sitio de trauma en la posdictadura dominicana (2015) Mitologías Hoy, 12; Blackmore, L., (2017) Spectacular modernity: Dictatorship, space, and visuality in Venezuela, 1948–1958, , Pittsburgh, PA: University of Pittsburgh Press; Blackmore, L., Domínguez Dubuc, J., (2016) Después de Trujillo/After Trujillo. 72 min.

This article explores how this leads to processes of cosmopolitanism and/or encapsulation in a particular group, voluntary gay migrants in Belgium, focusing on the intersection between ethno-cultural and sexual identifications and connections. Drawing on in-depth interviews, the cosmopolitan outlook of the participants becomes clear, as their national and ethno-cultural connections are relatively weak while they identify more strongly with cosmopolitan LGBTQ (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer) culture. However, while more salient, sexuality is not all-defining either, bespeaking their rather privileged position as a group of migrants who are self dependent and not strongly encapsulated in ethno-cultural nor sexual communities, with neither minority identity causing excessive stigmatization. As a consequence, they use digital and social media to simultaneously connect to different social spheres, although most do manage their self-presentation to avoid the clash or “collapse” of different social contexts online. © 2017 Taylor & Francis.",,,,,,,,,,"Altman, D., Richardson, D., Seidman, S., Globalization and the international gay/lesbian movement (2002) Handbook of lesbian and gay studies, , London, UK: Sage,.

The women used creative tactics to engage with technology, skillfully navigating and appropriating the terrain of situated gendered discourses.

As argued, the mediated visibility and voice of refugees and migrants matter precisely as the order of appearance (in Arendt’s terms) in digital Europe represents a fundamental dimension of the continent’s communicative order: revealing who speaks and who is silenced, which actors are heard and which are sidelined in the context of Europe’s “migration crisis.” The incorporation of refugee and migrant voices in digital Europe shows that voice does not guarantee recognition; rather, its incorporation reveals the complex politics of digital representation: on occasions challenging hegemonic power structures but most often digitally reaffirming bordering power and its symbolical articulations. © 2017 Taylor & Francis.",,,,,,,,"Against visual and textual representations of migrants and refugees as confident, well-integrated but also grateful agents, Aware Migrants’ agentive subjects appear desperate and regretful.

Aware Migrants’ main page includes eight tabs: One of them offers information about “legal channels to enter” a number of European countries; the remaining seven tabs focus on different elements of the dangers involved in “illegally” migrating from Africa to Europe. Those dangers are primarily narrated by (potential) African migrants, including, in one case, a music video titled “Be aware brother, be aware sister.” The website’s dominant format is video testimonies of 50–90 seconds—usually narrated in English or French, with English subtitles.

The pieces here present a nonbinary, integrated notion of an increasingly digitally mediated cosmopolitanism that accommodates differences within but also recognizes Europe’s colonial legacy and the fraught postcolonial present. Of special interest is an essay by the late Zygmunt Bauman, who argues that the messy boundaries of Europe require a renewed vision of cosmopolitan Europe, based on dialogue and aspirations, rather than on Eurocentrism and universal values. In this article, we focus on three overarching discussions informing this special issue: (a) an appreciation of the so-called “refugee crisis” and the articulation of conflicting Europeanisms, (b) an understanding of the relationships between the concepts of cosmopolitanization and encapsulation, and (c) a recognition of the emergence of the interdisciplinary field of digital migration studies. © 2018 Taylor & Francis.",,,,,,,"European Research Council, ERC: 647737

An exploration of postcolonial digital humanities methods, this article brings together quantitative textual analysis of news media articles from the United States and United Kingdom, postcolonial theory, and selfie scholarship to explore the representation of Syrian refugees in the news media and their self-representation in selfies. Examining “migrant-related selfies” theorized in scholarship on migrant media, I argue that photographs of refugees taking selfies are being marshaled by news media to complement reporting on immigration anxieties within the Global North. On the other hand, “refugee selfies,” the images refugees themselves are taking, avoid co-optation into such narratives. They do so, I propose, as a form of self-representation that produces agency, creates communities, and resists the inscription of refugees as objects of knowledge in the digital cultural record. © 2017 Taylor & Francis.",,,,,,,,,,"Anderson, B., (1983) Imagined communities: Reflections on the origin and spread of nationalism, , London, UK: Verso; Balahur, A., Steinberger, R., Rethinking sentiment analysis in the news: From theory to practice and back (2009) Proceedings of WOMSA, , Seville, Spain; Balahur, A., Steinberger, R., Kabadjov, M., Zavarella, V., Van Der Groot, E., Halkia, M., Belyaeva, J., (2013) Sentiment analysis in the news, , Pouliquen, B; Benton, M., Glennie, A., (2016) Digital humanitarianism: How tech entrepreneurs are supporting refugee integration, , Washington, DC: Migration Policy Institute; Chouliaraki, L., Symbolic bordering: The self-representation of migrants and refugees in digital news (2017) Popular Communication, 15 (2), pp. 78-94; Chun, W.K., (2006) Freedom and control: Power and paranoia in the age of fiber optics, , Cambridge, MA: MIT Press; De Leeuw, S., Rydin, I., Migrant children’s digital stories: Identity formation and self-representation through media production (2007) European Journal of Cultural Studies, 10 (4), pp. 447-464; Diminescu, D., The connected migrant: An epistemological manifesto (2008) Social Science Information, 47 (4), pp. 565-579; Du Bois, W.E.B., (1903) The souls of black folk, , Chicago, IL: A.C.

This study examines how counterterrorism efforts are underpinned by ill-conceived accounts of radicalization that preemptively construct Muslim migrants as a threat to national security, thereby justifying practices of mass surveillance that further propagate racist discourses of uncertainty and risk. We advance an analysis of a racialized surveillant assemblage, which is generative of mutable, algorithmically determined profiles of the Muslim-as-terrorist. Such a regime of mass surveillance effectively puts all Muslims under suspicion. We highlight that, paradoxically, mass data-mining operations stifle, rather than aid, the identification of actual terrorist threats. This conditions a paranoid surveillant racism, through which Muslim populations become modulated as an unknowable threat of death and destruction. © 2017 Taylor & Francis.",,,,,,,,,,"Agamben, G., (2008) State of exception, , London, UK: University of Chicago Press; Ahmed, S., Affective economies (2004) Social Text, 22 (2), pp. 117-139; Ajana, B., Surveillance and biopolitics (2005) Electronic Journal of Sociology, 7, pp. 1-15; Amoore, L., Algorithmic war: Everyday geographies of the war on terror (2009) Antipode, 41 (1), pp. 49-69; Browne, S., (2015) Dark matters: On the surveillance of blackness, , Durham, NC: Duke University Press; Brumnik, R., Podbregar, I., Ivanuša, T., Peterková, A., Brída, P., The efficiency of biometric systems in fight against terrorism (2011) TRANSCOM 2011: Security engineering, forensic engineering, , ilina, Slovak Republic: University of Žilina, &,.

Despite its limited scholarly attention, it is an influential site of meaning making, particularly for global youth cultures. Understanding polyculturalism as the suturing of self into multiple lineages, this project argues that Black American fans self-represent their K-pop fan interests as being salient to their racial identities. The videos construct identities that are not confined to the Black–White paradigm. Instead, YouTubers engage in fan practices of production, represent conformity to values within the fan community, articulate racially specific fan participation, and express concern for racially specific marginalizing discourses. Thus, the YouTube response video becomes a complicated site with multiple negotiations that reveal the self-production of polycultural identities. © 2017 Taylor & Francis.",,,,,,,,,,"Anderson, C.S., The Afro-Asiatic floating world: Post-soul implications of the art of iona rozeal brown (2007) African American Review, 41 (4), pp. 655-665. , http://aar.slu.edu, Retrieved from; Ang, I., The nature of the audience (1990) Questioning the media: A critical introduction, , Downing J., Mohammadi A., Sreberny-Mohammadi A., (eds), Newbury Park, CA: Sage,.

As a modern interpretation of the Sherlock Holmes character, Elementary is unique in emphasizing the detective’s struggles with drug addiction and mental illness, as well as a long road of recovery where intellectual labor is instrumental and “therapeutic” (rather than stressful and alienating). Despite its critical acclaim, Elementary’s progressive portrayals of symptoms of mental illness in Holmes are complicated by the series’s stereotypical depiction of villains that are “mad men,” “lunatics,” and “psychopaths” driven by financial gain and individual greed. The “acceptability” of mental illness in the series is measured by a character’s compliance with the dominant social order. While Elementary provides some positive messages about mental illness, its socioeconomic commentaries individualize “madness,” violence, and the pitfalls of late capitalism to support an increasingly problematic narrative of neoliberalism and mental health. © 2017 Taylor & Francis.",,,,,,,,,,"Bracken, P., Thomas, P., (2005) Postpsychiatry, , Oxford, UK: Oxford University Press; Brayton, S., The “madness” of market logic: Mental illness and late capitalism in The Double and Nightcrawler (2016) Communication and Critical/Cultural Studies, , 14(1), 66–82; Breger, E., TV needs to stop treating mental illness as a superpower (2014) New Republic, , https://newrepublic.com/article/117515/black-box-abc-and-tvs-mental-illness-problem, April, Retrieved from; Domino, G., Impact of the film One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest on attitudes towards mental illness (1983) Psychological Reports, 53 (1), pp. 179-182; Fisher, M., (2009) Capitalist realism: Is there no alternative?, , Winchester, UK: Zero Books; Fromm, E., (1955) The sane society, , New York, NY: Rinehart & Company, Inc; Gans-Boriskin, R., Wardle, C., Mad or bad?

Specifically, it looks to the action of the Brandalism project during COP21. This was the replacement of bus stop advertising with original artworks. This form of creative activism is unique in that it addresses the advertising industry as a key battlefield over cultural meaning and environmental sustainability. Through its use of the logic of appropriation inherent in culture jamming, this case challenges critiques about the incorporation of culture jamming within consumer culture. This work theorizes the case through the new politics of consumption, political consumerism, and culture jamming. It argues for the logic of appropriation, before it introduces the case study and explores the visual narratives of environmentalism: corporate greed, inadequate politicians, consumer saturation, Earth in mourning, and public commitment to the environment. Finally, it evaluates the contribution of Brandalism as a form of creative activism for environmentalism. © 2017 Taylor & Francis.",,,,,,,,,,"Agrawal, N., World leaders bombarded by art protest at Paris Climate Talks (2015) The Huffington Post, , http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/paris-climate-talks-artist-protests-corporations_us_565c5769e4b072e9d1c25108, Retrieved from, November 30); Alexander, J., Crompton, T., Shrubsole, G., Think of me as evil?

This trend could be compared to a trend in the first half of the 20th century in Iran, which opened the first chapter in the history of women asserting their presence and their voice as female musicians in public spaces, exemplified in the work of Qamar al-Moluk Vaziri. This article analyzes these two trends in their social and cultural contexts and explores the efforts of postrevolution female vocalists to assert their presence in musical realms. Addressing these issues in the context of political, religious, and cultural constraints, the article examines the agency of female musicians and vocal performers in the long history of women’s struggles for self-expression and voicing their presence in public spaces and on the national stage. © 2017 Taylor & Francis.",,,,,,,,,,"Alizadeh, H., (2015) Hossain Alizadeh dar Silever Harbor az Omid Goft [Hussain Alizadeh talks of hope in Silver Harbor Center]; Bernstein, J., (2004) Women’s voices across musical world, , Boston, MA: Northeastern University Press; Boyce, A.S., The Moslem women in the capital of Persia (1930) Moslem World, 20 (3), pp. 265-269; Chehabi, H.E., Voices unveiled: Women singers in Iran (2000) Iran and beyond: Essays in Middle East history in honor of Nikki R.

Employing musical and textual analysis, interviews, and a transnational perspective on cultural circulation and reception, I show how exile pop singer Dariush Eghbali’s adaptation of the original poem mobilized the text and opened it to audience participation. The article argues that the poem and its musical–textual permutations exemplify contemporary Iranian practices of national identification in which conflicting parties attempt to motivate “the Iranian people” to political ends. As actors from around the world and across the political spectrum repeatedly turn to nationalist poetry, song, anthem, and political speech, we observe how mass-mediated popular culture reveals ongoing recourse to nationalist forms even in transnational space. © 2017 Taylor & Francis.",,,,,,,,,,"Behbahani, S., Zendegi-ye shāʿirāna va ejtemāʿi yeki ast [My poetic and social lives are one].

This essay explores how Iranian musicians embrace the new and the familiar, the traditional and the popular, creating an original cultural hybrid. Questions of cultural identity and the politics of location and displacement are addressed using a theoretical cultural studies framework, incorporating themes of personal and collective nostalgia. This discussion is supplemented by documented narrative experiences from Iranian musicians and artists. Furthermore, the textual and musical analysis of singer-songwriter Mohsen Namjoo’s readaptation of the familiar Mexican ranchera song “Cielito Lindo” uncovers unique nuances and layers of meaning that not only shed light on one musician’s personal journey to exile, but also speak to a greater collective experience of Iranians today who continue to be torn between home and homeland. © 2017 Taylor & Francis.",,,,,,,,,,"Adorno, T., (1974) Minima Moralia, , Frankfurt, Germany: Suhrkamp Verlag; Azari, S., Mohsen Namjoo with Shoja Azari (2013) Brooklyn Rail, , http://www.brooklynrail.org/2013/02/music/Mohsen-namjoo-with-shoja-azari, February, Retrieved from; Boym, S., (2001) The future of nostalgia, , New York, NY: Basic Books; Cielito Lindo Wikipedia, , http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cielito_Lindo; Cohen, R., (1997) Global diasporas, , London, UK: Routledge; Davis, F., (1979) Yearning for yesterday: A sociology of nostalgia, , New York, NY: Free Press; Elbot, N., Not your grandfather’s Persian music (2014) Watson Institute, Brown University, , http://Watson.brown.edu/news/explore/2014/MohsenNamjoo, Retrieved from; Fathi, N., Iran’s Dylan on the lute, with songs of sly protest (2007) New York Times, , http://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/01/world/middleeast/01namjoo.html?pagewanted=all&pagewanted=print, September, Retrieved from; Hashemi, M., Biography (2009) Maryam Hashemi, , http://www.maryamhashemi.co.uk/about.aspx#biography, November, Retrieved from; Hashemi, M., Mother ships (2010) Celeste Network, , http://www.celesteprize.com/artwork/ido:55574/, June, Retrieved from; Holloway, T., Persian blend (2011) North Shore News, , http://www.nsnews.com/entertainment/Persian+blend/4108624/story.html, January, Retrieved from; Issa, R., Pakbaz, R., Shayegan, D., (2001) Iranian contemporary art, , London, UK: Barbican Art/Booth-Clibborn Editions; Keddie, N.R., (2003) Modern Iran: Roots and results of revolution, , New Haven, CT: Yale University Press; Kelley, R., Friedlander, J., (1993) Irangeles: Iranians in Los Angeles, , Berkeley, CA: University of California Press; Khadem, M., Jostojoo (2010) Mamak Khadem official website, , http://www.mamak-khadem.com/sn/audios/pt/full/catId/1/id/38, August, Retrieved from; Koca, Z.E., Mohsen Namjoo: Rebellious voice in exile (2015) Daily Sabah, , http://www.dailysabah.com/music/2015/02/05/Mohsen-namjoo-rebellious-voice-in-exile, February, Retrieved from; Mara beboos [Kiss me one last time] (2009) Lachini.com, , http://www.lachini.com/_/Scent+of+Yesterday+2/Mara+Beboos, Retrieved from; (2010) Allthelyrics.com, , http://www.allthelyrics.com/forum/persian-lyrics-translation/97563-mansour-translation-please.html, September, Retrieved from; McVitie, P., Cielito Lindo—How every Mexico fan identifies with the legendary Mariachi song (2014) Goal.com, , http://www.goal.com/en/news/6851/hyundai/2014/06/20/4863452/cielito-lindo-why-every-mexico-fan-identifies-with-the-legendary-, June, Retrieved from; (2011) Star Musician, , http://www.starmusician.com/andy_madadian.cfm, Retrieved from; Milani, A., (2003) Ghorbati, , http://www.iranian.com/Opinion/2003/March/Milani/index.html, March, Retrieved from; Milani, A., (2004) Lost wisdom: Rethinking modernity in Iran, , Washington, DC: Mage Publishers; Morán, A.O., ¡Hasta que me cayó el veinte!: Cielito lindo (2005) El Porvenir, , http://www.elporvenir.com.mx/notas.asp?nota_id=35816, October, Retrieved from; Naficy, H., (1993) The making of exile cultures: Iranian television in Los Angeles, , Minneapolis, MN: University of Minnesota Press; Naficy, H., Framing exile: From homeland to homepage (1999) Home, exile, homeland: Film, media and the politics of place, pp. 1-16. , Hamidy H., (ed), New York, NY: Routledge; P.

The article discusses a number of examples, but focuses primarily on the case of the music video “Happy in Tehran,” which was posted on YouTube in 2014 and which challenged certain local cultural and legal boundaries on behavior in public space. As a result, those responsible for the video were arrested, prompting an outcry, both within Iran and internationally; they were released soon after and eventually received suspended sentences. The article discusses the ways in which the “Happy in Tehran” incident was reported in the media outside Iran and offers alternative readings of the video and its meanings. Ultimately, the article considers how such reductionist views feed into wider regimes of orientalist representation and asks whose agenda such fetishization of resistance serves. © 2017 Taylor & Francis.",,,,,,,,,,"Abu-Lughod, L., The romance of resistance: Tracing transformations of power through Bedouin women (1990) American Ethnologist, 17 (1), pp. 41-55; Anderson, J.W., Roll over, Khomeini!

Today, classically trained musicians working the public concert circuit in Iran face a somewhat different picture of musical practice. Concert halls are typically much larger, audiences much wider, and performances much shorter. Many musicians tend to categorize themselves as classical, though they do not always perform according to the traditional parameters of the sonnati genre. This raises questions about new developments in classical music that fall just outside radif-based performance, and about the perceived conceptual relationship between sonnati and new-classical performance as the genre evolves. This article explores some of these dynamics through reflections among performers navigating Tehran’s classical concert circuit today. © 2017 Taylor & Francis.",,,,,,,,,,"Caton, M., Blum, S., The classical music of Iran: An introduction (2008) The concise Garland encyclopedia of world music, 2. , New York, NY: Routledge; During, J., Mirabdolbahi, Z., Safvat, D., (1991) The art of Persian music, , M.

Drawing on interviews with 17 parent bloggers, we explore how parents define the borders of their digital selves and justify what is their “story to tell.” We find that bloggers grapple with profound ethical dilemmas, as representing their identities as parents inevitably makes public aspects of their children’s lives, introducing risks that they are, paradoxically, responsible for safeguarding against. Parents thus evaluate what to share by juggling multiple obligations—to themselves, their children in the present and imagined into the future, and to their physical and virtual communities. The digital practices of representing the relational self are impeded more than eased by the individualistic notion of identity instantiated by digital platforms, thereby intensifying the ambivalence of both parents and the wider society in judging emerging genres of blogging the self. © 2017 Taylor & Francis.",,,,,,,"John D. and Catherine T.

We argue that self-representation in digital communication should not be treated as synonymous with selfies, and that selfies themselves should not be reductively equated with performances of embodiment. We do this through discussing “not-selfies”: visual self-representation consisting of images that do not feature the likenesses of the people who share them, but instead show objects, animals, fictional characters, or other things, as in the practices of #EDC (“everyday carry”) and #GPOY (“gratuitous picture of yourself”) on platforms such as Tumblr, Facebook, Instagram, and reddit. We present an account of self-representation as an emergent, recognizable, intertextual genre, and show that #EDC and #GPOY practices are best conceptualized as instances of self-representation. © 2017 Taylor & Francis.",,,,,,,,,,"Appadurai, A., Introduction: Commodities and the politics of value (1986) The social life of things, , Appadurai A., (ed), Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press; Bamberg, M., Who am I?

Chatroulette’s anonymity adds interesting context for impression creation in an online environment that emphasizes ocularcentrism of the embodied self. This article adds to methodologies of self-care for the qualitative researcher by positioning the issue of self-care in the online field, where “regular” interactions based on race, gender, sexuality, and more may leave autoethnographers from marginalized communities especially vulnerable. This study complicates the conceptual boundaries of “audience,” “participation,” and “observation” for online autoethnographic research. This research contributes to impression formation theory by focusing on the importance of the body in immediate, one-time impression constructions with conversational partners online.

They claim self-representation by traditionally stigmatized people can challenge normative presentations of beauty and gender. This article problematizes “empowerment” as a definitive and/or productive frame and argues instead for observation and analysis of “privilege” in situated practice. In this article I combine analysis of a collection of online cultural artifacts (including nonbinary selfies on Tumblr) and interviews with a small group of trans* social media storytellers to explore theoretical tensions between gender fluidity and identity fragmentation across multiple social media sites and practices. Gender-diverse digital self-representation encompasses both “consistent” androgyny, nonbinary, agender, and so on, and “emergent” presentations-in-flux. I assert that the ongoing iteration of self across social media—implied by self (re)presentation—can have simultaneous and contradictory political significance. I conclude that networked interpersonal complications frame understandings of empowerment, as perhaps they always have done. © 2017 Taylor & Francis.",,,,,,,,,,"(2014) Transgender selfies are “radical” self-love [News, pop culture, satire TV digital network], , http://fusion.net/culture/slideshow/transgender-selfies-radical-love-425834, February, Retrieved from; Bell, L., Trigger warnings: Sex, lies and social justice utopia on Tumblr (2013) Media, Communication and Cultural Studies Association, 6 (1), pp. 31-47; boyd, D., (2014) It’s complicated: The social lives of networked teens, , New Haven, CT: Yale University Press; Burns, A., Selfie-correction (2014) New Inquiry, , http://thenewinquiry.com/essays/selfie-correction/, August, Retrieved from; Burns, A., Self(ie)-discipline: Social regulation as enacted through the discussion of photographic practice (2015) International Journal of Communication, 9; Butler, J., (1990) Gender trouble: Feminism and the subversion of identity, , New York, NY: Routledge; Cho, A., Queer reverb: Tumblr, affect, time (2015) Networked affect(pp. 43–58), , https://books.google.com.au/books?id=fwhgBwAAQBAJ, Hillis K., Paasonen S., Petit M., (eds), Cambridge, MA: MIT Press; Cornelius, R., (1839) Robert Cornelius, self-portrait; believed to be the earliest extant American portrait photo [Photo]., , http://www.loc.gov/pictures/item/2004664436/, Retrieved from; Enbywerewolf, C., Fat trans queer [Social media microblogging platform], , http://enbywerewolf.tumblr.com/, Retrieved, from; Fink, M., Miller, Q., Trans media moments: Tumblr, 2011–2013 (2013) Television & New Media, 15, 611–626; Gamson, J., Must identity movements self-destruct?

How are they functioning, for whom, and to what end? This article takes up these questions via an examination of a sought-after user identity badge, the Twitter verification checkmark, figuring it as both an affective lure that incentivizes specific styles of self-presentation and a disciplinary means through which capitalist logics work to condition and subsume the significance of the millions of forms of self-presentation generated daily. Beneath the promise of democratized access to social status and fame, the business practices of the social platforms in and through which we self-present draw us into privatized strategies of social sorting, identity management, and control.

The main source of these impediments is also the basic building block of every telenovela: the love triangle. Because they unsettle the mother–daughter relation, mother–daughter–man triangles can be risky. But they can be successful too. This study examines the production, representation, consumption, and social regulation of the mother–daughter–man love triangle in three telenovelas: Ciudad Bendita (2006, Venevisión-Venezuela), Doña Bárbara (2008, Telemundo-USA), and La Mujer Perfecta (2010, Venevisión-Venezuela). Located under the umbrella of cultural studies, the study uses a multimethod approach that includes textual and ethnographic methods. The analysis underscores the writing and production challenges of this particular love triangle, considers the fit, or lack thereof, of the mother–daughter dyad with the virgin/whore dichotomy present in the majority of telenovelas, and fleshes out the nuances of audience reception of this type of triangle. © 2017 Taylor & Francis.",,,,,,,,,,"Acosta-Alzuru, C., Fraught with contradictions: The production, depiction, and consumption of women in a Venezuelan telenovela (2003) Global Media Journal, 2 (2). , http://www.globalmediajournal.com/open-access/fraught-with-contradictionsthe-production-depiction-and-consumption-of-women-in-a-venezuelan-telenovela.php?aid=35057, Retrieved from; Acosta-Alzuru, C., I’m not a feminist I only defend women as human beings: The production, representation and consumption of feminism in a telenovela (2003) Critical Studies in Media Communication, 20 (3), pp. 269-294; Acosta-Alzuru, C., (2007) Venezuela es una Telenovela, , Caracas, Venzuela: Editorial Alfa; Acosta-Alzuru, C., (2009) Carta de la autora de Doña Bárbara, , http://telenovelas-carolina-esp.blogspot.com/2009/05/carta-de-la-autora-de-dona-barbara.html, Retrieved from; Acosta-Alzuru, C., Beauty queens, machistas and street children: The production and reception of socio-cultural issues in telenovelas (2010) International Journal of Cultural Studies, 13 (2), pp. 1-19; Acosta-Alzuru, C., Dear Micaela: Studying a Telenovela Protagonist with Asperger’s Syndrome (2013) Cultural Studies <-> Critical Methodologies, 13 (2), pp. 125-137; Acosta-Alzuru, C., Melodrama, reality and crisis: The government-media relationship in Hugo Chávez’s Bolivarian Revolution (2014) International Journal of Cultural Studies, 17 (3), pp. 209-226; Acosta-Alzuru, C., (2015) Telenovela adentro, , Caracas, Venezuela: Editorial Alfa; Adrianzén Herrán, E., (2001) Las telenovelas: Como son, como se escriben, , Lima, Perú: Fondo Editorial de la Pontificia Universidad Católica de Perú; (2010) Ratings 10 p.m. Caracas, Venezuela: Venevision; (2007) Ciudad Bendita, , Caracas, Venezuela: Venevision; Allen, R.C., (1995) To be continued: Soap operas around the world, , New York, NY: Routledge; Alvarez, V., (2007) Lágrimas a Pedido: Así se escribe una Telenovela, , Caracas, Venezuela: Alfa; Artz, L., Telenovelas: Television stories for our global times (2015) Perspectives on Global Development & Technology, 14 (1-2), pp. 193-226; Barrera Tyszka, A., Desde las tripas de un culebrón (2002) Revista Bigott, pp. 62-65. , September–October–November–December; Benavides, O.H., (2008) Drugs, Thugs and Divas: Telenovelas and Narco-Dramas y Latin America, , Austin, TX: University of Texas Press; Blocker, R., Evolving telenovelas: Then, now, and the future (2012) Concientización: A Journal of Chican@ & Latin@ Experience and Thought, 8 (1-2), pp. 63-67; Cabrujas, J.I., (2002) Y Latinoamérica inventó la telenovela, , Caracas, Venezuela: Alfadil; (2009) Valentina dejas mucho que desear como escritora, , http://foros.msnlatino.telemundo.com/Telemundo/index.php?showtopic=2521&pid=28807&mode=threaded&start=-entry28807, Retrieved from; Casas Pérez, M.D.L.L., Cultural identity: Between reality and fiction, a transformation of genre and roles in Mexican telenovelas (2005) Television & New Media, 6 (4), pp. 407-414; (2012) Diario 2001, , http://www.noticias24.com/venezuela/noticia/107413/cerca-del-40-de-las-mujeres-en-venezuela-son-jefas-de-familia-revela-estudio/, May, Retrieved from; Chicharro Merayo, M., Telenovelas and society: Constructing and reinforcing the nation through television fiction (2012) European Journal of Cultural Studies, 16 (2), pp. 211-225; du Gay, P., Hall, S., MacKay, H., Negus, K., (1997) Doing cultural studies: The story of the Sony Walkman, , London, UK: Sage; Duncan, C., Looking like a woman: Some reflections on the Hispanic soap opera and the pleasures of female spectatorship (1995) Chasqui, 24 (2), pp. 82-92; Escudero Chauvel, L., Introducción: Genealogías y perspectivas (1997) Telenovela: Ficción popular y mutaciones culturales, pp. 9-13. , Verón E., Escudero Chauvel L., (eds), Barcelona, Spain: Gedisa; Fadul, A., Cultura e comunicação: A teoria necessária (1989) Comunicação, Democracia e Cultura, , Kunsch M.M., Assis Fernandes F., (eds), São Paulo, Brazil: Intercom and Loyola; Fuenzalida, V., Corro, P., Mujica, C., (2009) Melodrama, subjetividad e historia, , Santiago, Chile: Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile; Gallegos, R., (1929) Doña Bárbara, , Barcelona, Spain: Editorial Araluce; Giorgio, A., (2002) Writing mothers and daughters: Renegotiating the mother in Western European narratives by women, , New York, NY: Bergham Books; Greenberg, B., How do I explain romantic chemistry?

We argue that although numerous organizational stakeholders, such as the families of 9/11 victims, the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation, the New York Police Department, and the Port Authorities, had monolithic propositions about how to commemorate 9/11, the National September 11 Memorial and Museum ended up transforming into a heterotopic space marked by contestations, juxtapositions, and contradictions. Although many wanted to simply tell a unified tale about heroism and resilience, the social constructions of Ground Zero space have resisted monolithic historical accounts of remembrance despite the influential forces of utopian visions. This analysis contributes to the study of spatial and mnemonic representations by demonstrating the uses of heterotopology as a heuristic tool for unpacking polysemic and polyvalent spaces of commemoration that may otherwise appear consensual and monoglossic. © 2017 Taylor & Francis.",,,,,,,,,,"Agamben, G., (1998) Homo sacer: Sovereign power and bare life, , (D.

This case has been addressed on the WikiLeaks Twitter feed on a consistent basis over the past 6 years. The tweets from WikiLeaks to millions of followers constitute a form of popular communication where a broad—albeit somewhat prefigured—audience is targeted using an open social media platform. With this audience in mind, I analyze the use of Twitter by WikiLeaks to address the 2010 rape allegations against Assange (and the subsequent follow-on events after those allegations), with a particular focus on two issues: (a) the framing by WikiLeaks of the allegations, Sweden, rape, and feminism; and (b) how the sources (links) used in those tweets to back up claims should be seen as part of the general framing process. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.",,,,,,,,,,"Adamic, L.A., Adar, E., Friends and neighbors on the web (2003) Social Networks, 25 (3), pp. 211-230; Altheide, D.L., The news media, the problem frame, and the production of fear (1997) The Sociological Quarterly, 38 (4), pp. 647-668; Baek, K., Holton, A., Harp, D., Yaschur, C., The links that bind: Uncovering novel motivations for linking on Facebook (2011) Computers in Human Behavior, 27 (6), pp. 2243-2248; Benkler, Y., A free irresponsible press: Wikileaks and the battle over the soul of the networked fourth estate (2012) Harvard Civil Rights-Civil Liberties Law Review, 46 (1), pp. 311-397; Berger, A., (1991) Media research techniques, , Newbury Park, CA: Sage; Brevini, B., Hintz, A., McCurdy, P., (2013) Beyond WikiLeaks: Implications for the future of communications, journalism and society, , Basingstoke, UK: Palgrave Macmillan; Bruns, A., Stieglitz, S., Quantitative approaches to comparing communication patterns on Twitter (2012) Journal of Technology in Human Services, 30 (3-4), pp. 160-185; Burgess, J., Bruns, A., Twitter archives and the challenges of ‘big social data’ for media and communication research (2012) M/C Journal, 15 (5). , http://journal.media-culture.org.au/index.php/mcjournal/article/viewArticle/561, Retrieved, from; Cannon, S.C., Terrorizing WikiLeaks: Why the embargo against Wikileaks will fail (2013) Journal on Telecommunication & High Technology Law, 11 (1), pp. 305-325; Christensen, C., We have taken our eyes off the prize (2012) British Journalism Review, 23 (3), pp. 48-53; Christensen, C., A decade of WikiLeaks: So what?

Beginning with the Portuguese colonization of Brazil and Lusophone Africa in the 17th century and continuing to the contemporary moment, our discussion examines how a combination of political, ideological, and economic patterns created linkages between Portugal, Brazil, and Portuguese-speaking colonies in Africa (namely Angola, Cape Verde, and Mozambique). After examining how Brazil grew to become the dominant cultural producer in this transnational matrix (most explicitly expressed through the massive exports of telenovelas and music since the late 1970s), we examine how other countries are beginning to carve out distinctive national niches, including the contemporary music scene in Cape Verde and the rise of domestically produced telenovelas in Portugal and Angola that are increasing in circulation in the contemporary transnational Lusophone media space. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.",,,,,,,,,,"Alencastro, L.F., (2001) O Trato dos Viventes: Formação do Brasil no Atlântico Sul, séculos XVI e XVII, , São Paulo, Brazil: Companhia das Letras; Arenas, F., (2005) Post-colonialism, globalization, and lusofonia: The ‘time-space’ of the Portuguese-speaking world, , Public Lecture, Institute of European Studies, University of California-Berkeley, March, 2005; Arenas, F., (2011) Lusophone Africa: Beyond Independence, , Minneapolis, MN: University of Minnesota Press; Bolaño, C., (1988) O Mercado Brasileiro de Televisão, , Aracaju, Brazil: Universidade Federal de Sergipe; Borelli, S.H.S., Priolli, G., (2000) A Deusa Ferida: Por Que a Rede Globo Nao é Mais a Campea Absoluta de Audiencia, , São Paulo, Brazil: Summus Editorial; Borges, V., Artistas em rede ou artistas sim rede?

This article performs a critical analysis of the image at the centre of the Todd Carney bubbling scandal, as well as discourse surrounding it—on two contrasting forums, SharksForever and JustUsBoys. The analysis uncovers various insights into this particular image and the unspoken codes and unseen homoerotic rituals and bonding boy cultures of Australian team sportsmen and their “mates.” The argument is made that the image itself, along with its widespread publication on social media and construction through discourse, points to the limits of “proper” masculinity and, ultimately, perversion of the expectations placed on league males as heterosexual hero icons. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.",,,,,,,,,,"Albury, K., Carmody, M., Evers, C., Lumby, C., Playing by the rules: Researching, teaching and learning sexual ethics with young men in the Australian National Rugby League (2011) Sex Education, 11 (3), pp. 339-351; Anderson, E., (2010) In the game: Gay athletes and the cult of masculinity, , New York, NY: SUNY Press; Todd Carney’s NRL career has been littered by off-field indiscretions (2014) ABC News, , http://www.abc.net.au/news/2014-06-29/todd-carney27s-history-of-trouble/5558332, Retrieved, from; Barthes, R., (1972) Mythologies(A.

These documentaries are part of a discourse of collectability marked by the urge to discover and narrate a “quest” that has its precedents in record collecting as obsessive cultural practice and in the fetishizing of obscurity. Furthermore, they can be seen as “performances” of the artiste and repertoire (A&R) process but for a “post-rock” era in which the customary roles of A&R have largely been eclipsed by social, economic, and technological changes to the music industry: the “(re-)discovery” of Onyeabor and Rodriguez exemplifies an increasingly common fusion of, rather than oscillation between, novelty and nostalgia in the music industry, as “old” artists are “newly” discovered through practices of media archaeology aimed at unearthing artifacts of cultural and economic value from an ever bigger and denser digital archive. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.",,,,,,,,,,"Appadurai, A., (1986) The social life of things: Commodities in cultural perspective, , Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press; Bannister, M., (2006) White boys, white noise: Masculinities and 1980s indie guitar rock, , Farnham, UK: Ashgate; Battsek, M., (2012) Searching for sugar man[Film].

In Norway, streaming represented 88% of digital music revenues in 2014 versus just 23% globally. In essence, streaming services offer subscribers access to vast databases of music and offer artists new means of exposure and sources of revenue. This article argues that the possibility of musical discovery is essential to these services’ distribution model. It examines the provisions for exploration through streaming, pointing to automated algorithms and human curation as key devices. It then collects quantitative data on the presentation of music via a Norwegian service (WiMP/Tidal) and qualitative findings from interviews with consumers about their experiences with music streaming. Key discrepancies arise between the promise and the reality of streamed-music discovery, both for artists seeking new fans (and funds) and for audiences expecting streaming to supersede existing forms of musical exploration. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.",,,,,,,,,,"Anderson, C., (2006) The long tail: Why the future of business is selling less of more, , New York, NY: Hyperion; Andersson Schwarz, J., Burkart, P., Piracy and social change (2015) Popular Communication, 13, pp. 1-5; Bishop, B., (2013) Thom Yorke pulls music from Spotify, calls it unfair to new artists, , http://www.theverge.com/2013/7/15/4523978/thom-yorke-pull-albums-from-spotify-and-rdio-calls-them-unfair-to-new-artists, Retrieved, from; Burkart, P., McCourt, T., (2006) Digital music wars: Ownership and control of the celestial jukebox, , Lanham, MD: Rowman and Littlefield; Burnett, R., Weber, R.P., (1989) Concentration and diversity in the popular music industry, 1948–1986, , August, Paper presented at the 84th Annual American Sociological Association Conference, San Francisco, CA:; Ek, D., (2014) $2 billion and counting, , https://news.spotify.com/us/2014/11/11/2-billion-and-counting/, Retrieved, from; Ellis-Petersen, H., (2014) Taylor Swift takes a stand over Spotify music royalties, , http://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/nov/04/taylor-swift-spotify-streaming-album-sales-snub, Retrieved, November, from; Frith, S., (1983) Sound effects: Youth, leisure and the politics of rock’n’roll, , London, England: Constable; Hirsch, P.M., (1970) The structure of the popular music industry, , Ann Arbor, MI: Survey Research Center.

Across these various contexts there are often inherent connections between discovery and colonialism, connections that become most apparent in non-Western socio-cultural and musical settings. In this article, I situate discourses of discovery within the “coloniality of power,” noting how colonial discovery can be more critically described as invention. From here, I turn to the genre of World Music as an example of how musical discovery is underpinned by inherently colonial perspectives, articulations of power, and relationships of dominance and subordination between Western and non-Western cultures. In contrast, I present the concept of interculturalism as a way of thinking about the possibilities of cultural in-between-ness beyond discovery, drawing on the practices of musicians who articulate intercorporeal and intercultural communication through performance. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.",,,,,,,,,,"Barney, K., Musical entanglements at the contact zone: Exploring Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australian collaborations through contemporary music (2013) Communities, places, ecologies: Proceedings of the 2013 IASPM-ANZ conference, , O’Regan J., Wren T., (eds), Brisbane, Australia: International Association for the Study of Popular Music; Bartleet, B.-L., Carfoot, G., Desert harmony: Stories of collaboration between Indigenous musicians and university students (2013) International Education Journal: Comparative Perspectives, 12 (1), pp. 180-196; Barz, G.F., Cooley, T.J., (1997) Shadows in the field: New perspectives for fieldwork in ethnomusicology, , Oxford, UK: Oxford University Press; Connell, J., Gibson, C., World music: Deterritorializing place and identity (2004) Progress in Human Geography, 28 (3), pp. 342-361; Denzin, N.K., (2003) Performance ethnography: Critical pedagogy and the politics of culture, , Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage; Escobar, A., Worlds and knowledges otherwise: The Latin American modernity/coloniality research program (2010) Globalization and the decolonial option, , Mignolo W.D., Escobar A., (eds), London, England: Routledge; Fairley, J., The “local” and “global” in popular music (2014) Living politics, making music: The writings of Jan Fairley, , Frith S., Rijven S., Christie I., (eds), Surrey, UK: Ashgate; Feld, S., Pygmy POP.

In their accounts of exchanging mixes and their reflections on the meanings attached to them, mixers display the gamut of hopes and fears surrounding their relationships. While the mix tape often is represented as a token of unreserved intimacy, the practice of making and exchanging mixes can as easily be understood as a ritual of distance, one that betrays our ambivalence about dialogue and our delight in one-way communication. Based on interviews with donors and recipients of mix tapes and CDs, I will summarize four versions of the mix as a ritual of distance—communion, devotion, display, and fantasy—each building on its predecessor to round out the mix’s relational meaning. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.",,,,,,,,,,"Barkan, R., (2007) Crossword, p.

The Roma, or the Gypsies, in particular have been one of the most reviled and marginalized ethnic groups. This study examines textual representations of gypsies in contemporary popular culture, evident in a musical adaptation of Victor Hugo’s celebrated novel The Hunchback of Notre Dame and its accompanying worldwide press coverage. It finds that artistic and press representations of the gypsy woman Esmeralda embody characteristics consistent with historic stereotypes of the bohemian. It also shows that the novel’s band of Parisian criminals have been reconfigured for present-day global audiences to include critique of current political and popular discourses about immigration. International critics, however, miss this latter point and confine their reporting to dominant ideology and (continued) rhetorical colonization of the other. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.",,,,,,,,,,"(1999) Notre Dame de Paris[DVD], , France: Pomme Musique; Bamigboye, B., It’s Friday!

Approaching this tour as an example of paratextuality, the article pursues two arguments. First, it reflects upon the attempts used within the tour for encouraging connection between participants and the locations visited from the perspective of immersion. However, noting preceding positions, it is recognized that the tour constructs forms of imaginative immersion. The terms symbolic and cued immersion are subsequently introduced to consider the strategies that the tour employs to position fans and engage them with its frequently quotidian spaces. Second, the article explores the links between the tour’s immersive strategies and its institutional context, arguing that these assist in reinforcing core brand values regarding BBC Worldwide. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.",,,,,,,,,,"Aden, R.C., (1999) Popular stories and promised lands: Fan cultures and symbolic pilgrimages, , Tuscaloosa, AL: University of Alabama Press; Avery, J., Down and out in Atlantic City (2012) The Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science, 642, pp. 139-151. , July; Babcock, B., (1978) The reversible world: Symbolic inversion in art and society, , Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press; (2012) BBC One service licence, , http://www.bbc.co.uk/bbctrust/our_work/services/television/service_licences/bbc_one.html, Retrieved from; http://www.bbcworldwide.com/about-us.aspx, Retrieved from; (2014) BBC Worldwide annual report, 2013/14, , http://www.bbcworldwide.com/annual-review/annual-review-2014.aspx, Retrieved from; Beattie, M., The “Doctor Who Experience” (2012-) and the commodification of Cardiff Bay (2013) New dimensions of Doctor Who: Adventures in space, time and television, pp. 177-191. , Hills M., (ed), New York, NY: I.B.

Critics and fans pushed back, complaining that the homogenizing system of production crushed individuality. The piano competition is evolving again, as the social media and interactive technologies have presented new latitudes to various actors. The subsequent reposturing by them has led to the emergence of a new type of competition, wherein the focus is not on the final product (the winning pianist) but on the selection process, which has become a highly publicized spectacle that is profitable for the organizers and rewarding to other actors including contestants who do not win. This shift dispels the tension between production and performance by turning the stage into the star of the show, effectively freeing pianists to express their musicality by appealing directly to the audience. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.",,,,,,,,,,"Abeles, H., Development and validation of a clarinet performance adjudication scale (1973) Journal of Research in Music Education, 21 (3), pp. 246-255; Adair, M., The YouTube symphony orchestra is back for a second year – but why?

This article explores two series that offer self-sufficiency as a solution to the problem of industrial agriculture. Escape to River Cottage and Gourmet Farmer each centre on a narrative of a city-dweller moving to the country to set up a smallholding. With their nostalgia for an earlier—simultaneously unproblematic and emotionally fulfilling—time of food production, these series imagine a Utopian lifestyle in which audiences are encouraged to choose to produce and consume differently. That it is (middle-class) men who are rediscovering traditional food practices highlights how media discourses surrounding food production can become entangled in gendered representations that give rise to niche food products and experiences designed to ameliorate feelings of risk and uncertainty in contemporary food systems. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.",,,,,,,"Australian Research Council, ARC: DE140101412","This research was funded by an Australian Research Council Discovery Early Career Research Award (DE140101412).",,"Adema, P., Vicarious consumption: Food, television and the ambiguity of modernity (2000) Journal of American & Comparative Cultures, 23 (3), pp. 113-124; Appadurai, A., (1996) Modernity at large: Cultural dimensions of globalization, , Minneapolis, MN: University of Minnesota Press; Ashley, B., Hollows, J., Jones, S., Taylor, B., (2004) Food and cultural studies, , London, England: Routledge; Barnes, C., Mediating good food and moments of possibility with Jamie Oliver: Problematising celebrity chefs as talking labels (2014) Geoforum.

At the same time, the increasing usage of social media by popular culture celebrities for self-promotion has been signaled. We study the extent to which social media can reduce inequalities in mainstream media attention between artists from central cities in popular music production (e.g., New York, London) versus more peripheral cities. We distinguish between media attention by institutionally embedded music critics and lay users on the internet. The results show that artists coming from more central cities have higher chances to get attention in mainstream media—both by institutional critics and lay users—than artists from peripheral cities. Building a fan base on social media such as Facebook, Twitter, or MySpace can compensate for some of this inequality, but not for all of it. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.",,,,,,,,,,"Anderson, C., (2006) The long tail, , New York, NY: Hyperion; Baym, N., Burnett, R., Amateur experts: International fan labor in Swedish independent music (2009) International Journal of Cultural Studies, 12, pp. 433-449; Baym, N., Ledbetter, A., Tunes that bind?

Articles on the websites for Grantland, Deadspin, The Nation, Esquire, Ebony, and many others shamed Sherman’s racist detractors enthusiastically. This essay argues that the Sherman incident charted an elaborate anti-racist political argument calibrated to reflect the demands and objectives of neoliberal capitalism. I advance this argument in two main sections. First, I explain how the relationship between anti-racism and neoliberalism is complicated by what Jodi Dean calls communicative capitalism, a situation that neutralizes the purported effects of anti-racist speech in support of Richard Sherman. Second, I show how Sherman’s challenge to the notion of Black respectability renders his blackness imaginary, a move that depoliticizes capitalist relations in the name of anti-racism. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.",,,,,,,,,,"Andrejevic, M., (2007), http://politicsandculture.org/2009/10/02/mark-andrejevic-on-symbolic-efficiency/, The body, torture, and the decline of symbolic efficiency.

Sound, however, plays a crucial role in the cultivation, maintenance, and performance of sports fandom. Using Seattle’s 12th Man and the discourses surrounding it, this essay examines the relationship between sound, space, and fandom in the contemporary National Football League. We consider how fans’ sonic labor is constitutive of their place within a fan community; the relationship between sound and fandom’s spatial and affective dimensions; and how contemporary sport and media organizations capitalize on fans’ production of sound and the embodied experience and communal identity it fashions. By investigating the 12th Man’s sonic relations to fandom, space, games, and television, we demonstrate how the league has shifted from regulating fan noise as an interruption to cultivating it as a communicative resource that adds value to games. © 2016 Mack Hagood and Travis Vogan.",,,,,,,,,,"Badenhausen, K., (2011), http://www.forbes.com/sites/kurtbadenhausen/2011/12/14/the-nfl-signs-tvdeals-worth-26-billion/, December 14).

First, the film problematizes the notion of head injury as merely “part of the game” and a risk that players ostensibly understand when they enter the National Football League. Second, the film’s depiction of Mike Webster’s “unruly” body further de-naturalizes concussions and contests the masculine ideal of bodily sacrifice in pro football. Third, the film explicitly critiques the role of sports media in constructing a mythology and spectacle of pro football that contributed to the cultural context in which the concussion crisis has emerged. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.",,,,,,,,,,"Anderson, E., Kian, E.M., Examining media contestation of masculinity and head trauma in the National Football League (2012) Men and Masculinities, 15 (2), pp. 152-173; Baker, A., Masculinity, race, and violence in Any Given Sunday (2014) The NFL: Critical and cultural perspectives, , Oates T.P., Furness Z., (eds), Philadelphia, PA: Temple University Press; Butterworth, M.L., Katie was not only a girl, she was terrible”: Katie Hnida, body rhetoric, and football at the University of Colorado (2008) Communication Studies, 59 (3), pp. 259-273; Butterworth, M.L., The athlete as citizen: Judgement and rhetorical invention in sport (2014) Sport in Society, 17 (7), pp. 867-883; Butterworth, M.L., NFL Films and the militarization of professional football (2014) The NFL: Critical and cultural perspectives, pp. 205-225. , Oates T.P., Furness Z., (eds), Philadelphia, PA: Temple University Press; Connell, R.W., Messerschmidt, J.W., Hegemonic masculinity: Rethinking the concept (2005) Gender & Society, 19 (6), pp. 829-859; Couturie, B., Else, J., (1985) Disposable heroes: The other side of football[Documentary], , Los Angeles, CA: H.B.O.

The NFL takes these steps because becoming a fan of any sport is not a passive process; it requires significant, focused labor to learn the requisite knowledge and perform an identity tied to the consumption of specific cultural commodities. We specifically look at the television show NFL Rush Zone, produced in partnership with Nickelodeon, and the website nflrush.com that together form an inter-textual pedagogical and performative narrative space where children can learn to be football fans and simultaneously perform a fan identity. Since fans are central to the NFL’s $9.5 billion annual revenues, we argue that this process of subjectification is also a process of commodification. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.",,,,,,,,,,"Aarseth, E., The culture and business of cross-media productions (2006) Popular Communication, 4 (3), pp. 203-211; Ashley, M., Sports licensing: 2010 year-in-review (2011) The Licensing Journal, 31 (1), pp. 1-6; Banet-Weiser, S., (2007) Kids rule!: Nickelodeon and consumer citizenship, , Durham, NC: Duke University Press; Barnes, S., Virtual worlds come of age (2010) Journal of Virtual Worlds Research, 3 (3), pp. 3-18; Bhabha, H.K., DissemiNation: Time, narrative, and the margins of the modern nation (1991) Nations and narration, pp. 291-322. , Bhabha H.K., (ed), London, England: Routledge; Blair, E., (2012) The NFL’s new target demographic: Kids.

Albums by nonwhite artists tend to receive lower evaluations than those by white artists, particularly when reviewed by consumer critics. Although both types of reviewers often ignore talking about race—echoing a color-blind ideology—(semi-)professional critics are more explicit and color-conscious regarding nonwhite participation in rock music. Furthermore, five different mechanisms are employed by reviewers as a part of ethno-racial boundary work: (i) ethno-racial comparisons, (ii) inter-genre comparisons, (iii) positive ethno-racial marking, (iv) negative ethno-racial marking, and (v) minimization.

The assemblage of this sanctuary on a website hosting billions of user-generated contents is made possible by means of folksonomy and website architecture, and a two-fold social dynamic based on participatory commitment and the institutionalization of a collective entity. Unlike “physical” spontaneous shrines erected in public spaces, these digital shrines connect the bereaved with provocative or outrageous contributions, notably tributes from school shooting fans using participatory media to commemorate the killer’s memory. This side effect, generated by the technical properties of the platform, compromises the tranquility of the memorial and muddles the boundaries and the contents of such sanctuaries.

Amidst an ongoing debt crisis and a continuing exploration of its identity as a supranational entity, “Embassy Day” affords an opportunity to see the EU as a spatial network uneasily caught in the tensions between the often nostalgic nationalism of its constituent countries and the future-oriented technocratic transnationalism of its composite alliance. By analyzing the cultural artifacts of Embassy Day from its handouts, maps, speeches, architecture, and performances, I treat Embassy Day as a “rhetorical experience” and the EU embassies as a transnational network imposed over the city space of Washington, D.C. In the process, I argue that the very fragmented nature of the open house’s complex simulation of Europe mirrors the fragmented nature of European identity itself, and thus displays the anxiety around how the EU places itself and its power vis-à-vis the global community.

They are strategically placed to promote candidates and convince voters. However, viewers are not just passive receivers; they can also reciprocate and “jam” an election poster. This article offers an explorative approach to such practices to study their creation and usage. Two distinct examples of defacement are chosen and examined. Both of these reacted to the Social Democratic Party of Germany’s (SPD) election campaign for the German federal election in 2005. The election took place after widespread protests and a loss of confidence in the SPD and its chancellor. The investigated posters showed parallels to political culture jamming, though parody or disturbing effects are not true of all modifications. Election posters are also used as a medium to communicate politics from the grassroots.

In comparison to dozens of reality television programs that emphasize weight-loss, Big Sexy critiques the idea that all fat individuals need to lose weight, or should even want to lose weight in the first place. This resistant message of fat acceptance exists in a carnivalesque televisual space, creating a site for the interplay of competing, yet increasingly co-present discourses of the body despite the dominance of “obesity epidemic” rhetoric. Ultimately, Big Sexy necessitates a different theoretical lens than the one often applied to reality television, namely neoliberalism in relation to governmentality, shame, and self-discipline, in order to make sense of its uniqueness within this continually expanding genre.

However, in the aftermath of the Utøya massacre there have been several instances where hip hop music and performances have been subjected to politicised debate in the Norwegian public sphere. Based on a qualitative case study of the media reception of the Norwegian hip hop group Karpe Diem, this study finds that their music both provoked and fed into extensive public debates concerning topical cultural and political issues. Moreover, this study outlines the process through which Karpe Diem and their music came to be publicly identified, and responded to, as politically significant. Based on the evidence of the findings, this article further argues that hip hop music fills a peripheral (yet significant) function in the model of the political system as outlined by Habermas (2006).

To counter that challenge, we argue for a heightened awareness of the brand’s temporality. In the service of this goal, this article explores several cases of aging brands, retro brands, and abandoned trademarks to showcase how consideration of brands in time reveals their contingent and historical nature.

This article scrutinizes the role of social media in China in opening up new windows of opportunities for mass collaboration and collective action. The analysis is embedded in the current Chinese socio-political power relations and hegemonic structure, and focuses on the salient themes, trending patterns, and circumstantial factors underlying this type of social media activism.

Yet the recent political and media opening in Myanmar has provoked celebratory headlines as eager foreigners rush in with investment ideas. These changes distract from atrocities in rural areas, as media serve as the entry point to such crises for most outsiders. This study analyzes a series of 2013 Reuters investigative reports on the Rohingya that won the 2014 Pulitzer Prize, and then a series of blog posts that further the story appearing in English language transnational media. Drawing theoretically from critical human rights scholarship, this analysis provides insight not only into how human rights discourse is employed and for what potential purposes but also into the hierarchies and tensions inherent in the processes of global journalism. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"(2014), http://www.aljazeera.com/news/asia/2014/08/myanmar-asks-shunning-rohingya-name-201482085741256557.html; (2012) Issues to be raised concerning the situation of stateless Rohingya children in Myanmar (Burma), , January, For the Examination of the combined 3rd and 4th periodic State Party Reports (CRC/C/MMR/3-4; Brooten, L., Ashraf, S.I., Agwaziam, N., Traumatized victims and mutilated bodies: Human rights and the “politics of immediation” in the Rohingya crisis of Burma/Myanmar International Communications Gazette, , in press; Cheah, P., (2006) Inhuman conditions: On cosmopolitanism and human rights, , Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press; Drummond, A., (2014), http://www.andrew-drummond.com/2014/04/reuters-in-row-over-rohingya-pulitzer.html; (2013), http://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/reports/burma0413_brochure_web_0.pdf; Lindlof, T.R., Taylor, B.C., (2011) Qualitative communication research methods, , 3rd, Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage:; Marshall, A.R.C., Myanmar gives official blessing to anti-Muslim monks (2013) Reuters, , http://www.pulitzer.org/files/2014/international-reporting/reuters/07reuters2014.pdf], June 27, Retrieved from [and its accompanying shorter piece, “The 969 catechism.” Reuters.

This article presents ICED as a type of popular solution to the challenge of using videogames for meaningful social criticism and analyzes its mode of production as the key source for this popular potential. The creators use design techniques and gaming tactics common in virtual worlds to create a humanitarian game that problematizes the idea of free will. Instead of making free will a tool for progressing in the game, ICED uses roaming to create a frustrating game experience. This frustration is an affective lesson about undocumented immigration and the social and legal environment that casts individuals in a world void of freedom and some basic human rights. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Agamben, G., (2005) State of exception, , Chicago, IL: University of Chicago Press; Amaya, H., (2013) Citizenship excess: Latinas/os, media, and the nation, , New York, NY: New York University Press; Barnes, B., (2000) Understanding agency: Social theory and responsible action, , Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage; Bogost, I., (2011) How to do things with videogames, , Minneapolis, MN: University of Minnesota Press; Bourdieu, P., (1977) Outline of a theory of practice, , New York, NY: Cambridge University Press; Breakthrough, (2010) Breakthrough: Public relations materials, , New York, NY: Breakthrough:; (2003), http://us.breakthrough.tv/mission-vision/; Brookey, R.A., Paradise crashed: Rethinking mmorpgs and other virtual worlds.

Particular moments of the Palestinian cause are highlighted, beginning with the movement’s circulation within third world liberation struggles and anti-imperial movements, which thrust the Palestinian struggle to prominence in contemporary history and across media platforms. By the 1980s, Palestine became deployed as an unresolved system of imperialism, and as media attention expanded the result was an abstraction of the struggle’s anti-colonial origins. This tension of attention and abstraction is discernible in contemporary solidarity movements on human rights and social justice. The article concludes that as the cause continues to gain universal traction, the core political issues are rendered distant and mediated spectacles. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"(1990), http://electronicintifada.net/blogs/nora-barrows-friedman/hear-nelson-mandela-discuss-support-palestine-1990-interview#Nelson%20Mandela%201990, June 21, Nightline transcript.

This case study investigates a media narrative produced by the Memory Center in Colombia, about a political assassination of a community leader. On February 12, 2009, Luis Arango was murdered in the Colombian region known as Magdalena Medio. Arango was a fisherman and a leader of local and regional fishing communities struggling to defend wetlands and natural environments from encroaching cattle and agribusiness economies. Arango was murdered to stop his leadership and environmental agendas. Arango’s assassination was selected as an emblematic case that illustrates well how Colombia’s armed conflict impacts community leaders trying to advance social justice agendas. This article explores how a new understanding of “the popular” was used to frame a media narrative about Arango’s case.

This article examines a Swedish radio show that broadcast listener-contributed computer code in the mid 1980s. It applies a combined theoretical framework of intermediality and sharing theory and argues that this combination is central to the analysis of piracy and social change. The results indicate an interesting paradox in terms of pushing and pulling content as the practice relied on both in public broadcasting as well as with contributing media users. As such, the case of Datorernas värld prefigures how peer interaction and sharing relies on more centralized and controlled channels of communication. The article historically situates themes such as intermediality, surveillance, gender representation, and piracy and provides a piece of computing history that is topical but, strangely, critically ignored. © , Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Acland, C.R., (2007) Residual media, , Minneapolis, MN: University of Minnesota Press; Andersson Schwarz, J., (2013) Online file sharing: Innovations in media consumption, , London, England: Routledge; Andersson Schwarz, J., Palmås, K., Introducing the panspectric challenge: A reconfiguration of regulatory values in a multiplatform media landscape (2013) Central European Journal of Communication, 6 (2), pp. 219-233; Arvidson, J., Askander, M., Bruhn, J., Führer, H., (2007) Changing borders: Contemporary positions in intermediality, 1. , Lund, Sweden: Intermedia Studies Press; Bakardjieva, M., Virtual togetherness: An everyday life perspective (2004) Community in the digital age: Philosophy and practice, , Feenberg A., Barney D., (eds), New York, NY: Rowman & Littlefield; Bassett, C., Feminism, expertise and the computational turn (2013) Renewing feminisms: Radical narratives, fantasies and futures in media studies, pp. 199-214. , Thornham H., Weissmann E., (eds), London, England: I.B.

Although labels and industry associations point their fingers at the harm digital piracy and file-sharing cause, they are less likely to admit the extent to which these anti-markets inform everyday decisions. File-sharing technologies create networks of users that serve as profitable data for ratings and metrics agencies. Using a case study of BigChampagne and its relationship to Napster, this article considers how the look, structure, and function of file-sharing software helped turn an economically threatening community into a commodity and how piracy’s disruptive potential is always in tension with processes of commodification. © , Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Andersson Schwarz, J., (2014) Online file sharing: Innovations in media consumption, , New York, NY: Routledge; Andrejevic, M., (2007) iSpy: Surveillance and power in the interactive era, , Lawrence, KS: University Press of Kansas; Ante, S., (2000), http://www.businessweek.com/stories/2000-08-13/inside-napster, August 14, Inside Napster.

During the military dictatorship (1973–1990), media activists used what they called “honorable piracy” for counter-communication efforts aimed at restoring democracy. Following the return to democracy, community television participants have rationalized their unauthorized transmission of alternative programming to low-income sectors using a similar logic of honorable piracy. For these community television participants, the digital transition represented the possibility of redefining democratic access to the public sphere and attaining legal recognition. Through an analysis of citizen activism around the move from analog to digital television, this article argues that discussion of piracy emerges as an expression of conflicting notions of the definition, use, and distribution of public resources. © , Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,"National Science Foundation, NSF","Research for this article was funded by a Fulbright-Hays Doctoral Dissertation Research Abroad Grant, a National Science Foundation Dissertation Improvement Grant, and the Craig M.

This article uses the availability of lesbian-focused films in Australia as a lens through which to consider the relationship between online audiovisual piracy and industry geoblocking practices. It is argued that artificial control through internet geoblocking can limit potential global sales by restricting universal availability of certain films. Anti-piracy discourses around lost sales and reduced profits for film industries are complicated by piracy contexts where there is no mechanism for viewers to make legal online purchases. When looking beyond Hollywood, the diverse purposes of independent and minority filmmakers provide a more complex understanding of piracy overall. This article proposes a more nuanced approach to online film piracy that emphasizes context, taking into consideration that pirate culture is formed by an extensive but inchoate network of individuals with diffuse motivations that have differential impacts upon the industry. © , Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"(2012), http://www.news.com.au/technology/australians-named-worst-offenders-for-illegally-download-game-of-thrones/story-e6frfro0-122636215818, News.com.au.

The article argues that while Anonymous can be broadly understood as cyberlibertarian, it is more complex and contradictory than this singular label implies. However, it also argues that the Anonymous ethos is not so amorphous that it prevents ideological analysis and critique.

The article will ask whether, in the context of neoliberalism and social media mobilizations, such intelligence is indeed “intelligent.” It explores the possibility that we are now closer to a general “idiocy” and that the likely decomposition of the common into a privatized neoliberal aggregation of individuals produces something closer to what Martin Heidegger refers to as the “they.” The concluding position is that the most likely route out of idiocy is the self-conscious cultivation of an “active” general intellect for the social media age. © , Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Badiou, A., (2006), http://tiny.cc/bq83fx, October, The saturated generic identity of the working class.

For example, the majority of London’s inhabitants are ethnic minorities. Following Massey (2005), city dwellers negotiate a situation of intense “throwntogetherness,” as they live in the proximity of ethnic, racial, and religious others. Shifting the dominant focus of media and migration scholarship from transnational communication toward local everyday practices, this article develops the notion of digital throwntogetherness to chart relationships between geographically situated digital identifications and the urban politics of cultural difference and encounter. The argument draws from in-depth interviews with 38 young people living in Haringey, one of the most diverse areas in London, and builds on digital methods for network visualizations. Two Facebook user experiences are considered: transnational networking with loved ones scattered around the world and engagement with geographically proximate diverse digital identifications. © , Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,"332318","This research was supported by a Marie Curie Intra European Fellowship within the 7th European Community Framework Programme, project reference 332318, Urban Politics of London Youth Analyzed Digitally (UPLOAD).",,"Ahmed, S., (2004) The cultural politics of emotion, , London, England: Routledge; Akomfrah, J., Gopaul, L., Lawson, D., [documentary film] (2013) The Stuart Hall Project, , (Director), Producers, United Kingdom: Smoking Dogs Films; Back, L., Home from home”: Youth, belonging and place (2005) Making race matter, pp. 19-41. , Alexander C., Knowles C., (eds), Basingstoke, England: Palgrave; Barthes, R., Semiology and the urban (1981) The city and the sign: An introduction to urban semiotics, pp. 87-98. , Gottdiener M., Lagopoulos A.P., (eds), New York, NY: Columbia University Press; (2014), http://www.demos.co.uk/, Bartlett, J., Reffin, J., Rumball, N., Williamson, S., Anti-social media.

An analysis of policy discourse associated with the World Summit on the Information Society shows how, despite the use of terms such as “open” and “participatory,” the practice of information and communication technology project implementation displays evidence of failures to empower local people. The discussion is framed by the lessons about asymmetrical institutionalized power from theories concerned with the dynamics of techno-economic change contrasted with the prevailing market-led technology diffusion perspective. The context for the article is the experience of contributing to a high-level policy report for the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization’s 2013 review of progress toward knowledge societies. Examples drawn from digital technology applications are used to illustrate the asymmetrical power relations embedded in these developments. © , Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Albornoz, L.A., Discussion paper, Knowledge Societies, Stakeholder Accountabiity for Sustainable Development, UNESCO WSIS+10 (2013) A comment on the report—renewing the knowledge societies vision, pp. 25-27. , Paris: February; (2009), http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0018/001803/180312e.pdf, Berger, G., Freedom of expression, access to information and empowerment of people.

This article traces a brief history of same-sex intimacy in sitcoms, then uses film and television stylistic analysis of the contemporary sitcoms Modern Family, Happy Endings, and The New Normal to argue that the positioning of the camera and the spatial relationship between actors is deliberate and conveys critical information. The article argues that sitcoms in the 21st century obscure same-sex kisses through camera angles, particularly the over-the-shoulder shot, and that the public/private dichotomy factors prominently into the spaces where same-sex intimacy is permissible and how such intimacy is filmed within the televisual home. Ultimately, gay representation in American network television comedy retains a conservative approach to same-sex intimacy even as it continues to include gay male characters in greater numbers.

Because of the different venues and delivery systems available for accessing televisual and cinematic content, the variety of high definition and standard definition television channels across cable and satellite providers, as well as the different aspect ratios filmmakers can choose to photograph their works, nontheatrical exhibition of the moving image continues to be a source of contention in the age of high definition. Drawing upon a number of comments from online home media forums, this study concludes that the variant quality of widescreen images for HDTV is not solely grounded on a subculture of home theatre enthusiasts, but rather how networks and studios negotiate new television technologies for the aesthetic preferences of both film and home theatre buffs and the general viewing audience.

Because of changing demographics, such companies have moved to reach new audiences. Given the technological sophistication of those audiences, corporations that sell televisual goods have put branding at the forefront. Webnovelas have become a powerful techno-cultural device that achieves the dual goal of becoming a preferred site for brand entertainment through sponsorship, while at the same time triggering audiences interaction in different mobile platforms producing data over audiences conceived as more ""valuable consumers."" Through data available to companies via audience interaction, these preferred audiences are even more susceptible to further commercial exploitation.

At the same time, it sold the value of men's participation in the hedonistic pleasures of accessible connoisseurship of the postwar marketplace by aligning consumer desires with sexual desires as innate components of modern masculinity. The purpose of this article is to illustrate how this persona is visually and discursively articulated throughout the entire Playboy empire, from the content of the magazines including the dewy centerfolds and the What Sort of Man Reads Playboy? campaigns to the brand's clubs and television shows. The persona undertook the dual tasks of attracting a lucrative male readership and its corresponding advertisers, while simultaneously redefining male consumer culture. © 2014 Copyright © 2014 Crown copyright.",,,,,,,,,,"Ang, I., (1985) Watching Dallas: Soap opera and melodramatic imagination, , London, England,: Methuen; Ang, I., (1991) Desperately seeking the audience, , London, England,: Routledge; Beggan, J., Gagne, P., Allison, S., An analysis of stereotype in refutation in Playboy by an editorial voice: The advisor hypothesis (2000) The Journal of Men's Studies, 9, pp. 1-21; Breazeale, K., In spite of women: Esquire magazine and the construction of the male consumer (1994) Signs, 20 (1), pp. 1-22; Cochoy, F., Another discipline for market economy: Marketing as performative knowledge and know-how for capitalism (1998) The laws of the markets, pp. 194-221. , In: Callon M., editors Oxford, England,: Blackwell Publishers; Cohen, L., (2003) A consumers' republic: The politics of mass consumption in postwar America, , New York, NY,: Alfred A Knopf; Cook, D., (2004) The commodification of childhood: The children's clothing industry and the rise of the child consumer, , Durham, NC,: Duke University Press; Coulter, N., (2014) Tweening the girl: The crystallization of the tween market, , New York, NY,: Peter Lang; Croft, M.J., (1994) Market segmentation: A step-by-step guide to profitable new business, , New York, NY,: Routledge; Dines, G., I buy it for the articles (1995) Gender, race and class in the media, pp. 254-262. , In: Dines G., Humez J.

TTOI is popular not only with a notoriously cynical British public, but even more so with the politicians and journalists that are the target of its ridicule. TTOI's politics are relatively radical, portraying the news media and politicians as forming a social apparatus which is rotten to the core, and thereby offering a challenge to liberal democracy itself. It is deeply ironic, then, that the show has been incorporated by this very apparatus. What does it mean for the show to be adopted so enthusiastically by the system it so aggressively derides, and what can it tell us about satire's relationship to cynicism, politics, and democracy?.

However, we argue in this article that although telenovelas do indeed have this remarkable penetration and popularity in Brazil, their reception is mediated by audience class, geographical location, race, and issues with media content. Many in the audience feel disenfranchised from the dominant telenovela representations, particularly on the primary network, TV Globo, because of their rural, Northeastern status and identity, or their Afro-Brazilian identity. They question their sense of belonging, not because they do not feel Brazilian, but because the ""Brazil"" they see on TV does not include them.

Independently produced and financed through a version of crowd-funding, the debate offers a window into the fundamentally hybrid nature of contemporary mediated political discourse. A novel form of hybrid celebrity politics afforded by emergent technological, economic, and cultural forces, the so-called ""Rumble in the Air Conditioned Auditorium"" interwove televisual celebrity, political advocacy, affective spectacle, and deliberative exchange. In so doing, it spoke to the increasingly complicated nature of representation, authenticity, and the possibilities of political speech in a hybrid media age.

From the Monroe Doctrine to Cold War demarcations such as containment and détente, the United States has sought to define its geopolitical position in relation to other nations through narratives which have served as popular reference points for interpreting shifts in international power relations. Why, then, is it unable to produce a compelling story of geopolitical space for the 21st century? This article examines historical examples of geopolitical discourse used by the United States in promoting its foreign policies in order to explore the question of why post-9/11 narratives have failed to successfully build upon narratives of popular struggle against the Soviet Union. There are, however, historical examples which suggest possible directions for rejuvenation. © 2014 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Agnew, J., (2003) Geopolitics: Re-visioning world politics, , 2nd, London, England, London, England,: Routledge; Agnew, J., Corbridge, S., (1995) Mastering space: Hegemony, territory and international political economy, , London, England, London, England,: Routledge; Amin, H., The view from Egypt (2009) Toward a new public diplomacy: Redirecting U.S. foreign policy, pp. 111-133. , In: Seib P., editors New York, NY, New York, NY,: Palgrave Macmillan; Andén-Papadopoulos, K., U.S. soldiers imaging the Iraq War on YouTube (2009) Popular Communication, 7 (1), pp. 17-27; Anderson, B., (1993) Imagined communities: Reflections on the origin and spread of nationalism, , London, England, London, England,: Verso; Antoniades, A., Miskimmon, A., O'Loughlin, B., Great power politics and strategic narratives (Working Paper 7) (2010) Brighton, England: Centre for Global Political Economy, , University of Sussex; Arrighi, G., (1978) The geometry of imperialism: The limits of Hobson's paradigm, , London, England, London, England,: NLB; Baym, G., Jones, J.P., News parody in global perspective: Politics, power, and resistance (2012) Popular Communication, 10 (1-2), pp. 2-13; Bogost, I., Videogames and ideological frames (2006) Popular Communication, 4 (3), pp. 165-183; Bourdieu, P., Wacquant, L., On the cunning of imperialist reason (1999) Theory, Culture & Society, 16 (1), pp. 41-58; Bush, G.H.W., (1988) Address accepting the presidential nomination at the Republican National Convention in New Orleans, , http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/sou.php, August 18; Bush, G.H.W., (1990) State of the Union Address, , http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/sou.php, January 31; Bush, G.H.W., (1991) State of the Union Address, , http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/sou.php; Bush, G.W., (2002) The national security strategy of the United States, , http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/sou.php; Castells, M., The new public sphere: Global civil society, communication networks, and global governance (2008) The ANNALS of the American Academy of Political and Social Science, pp. 78-93. , Thousand Oaks, CA, Thousand Oaks, CA,: Sage; Castonguay, J., The Spanish-American War in United States media culture (2006) Hollywood and war, pp. 97-108. , In: Slocum D.

More specifically, I highlight advertiser-created ""clubs."" As a complement to 1930s radio and comic strip sponsorships, dozens of national food brands introduced ""clubs"" for children. Through a series of case studies, I argue that by creating these clubs, national food advertisers embedded themselves in children's popular culture with the outcome of brand socialization-not simply immediate sales. These clubs offered access to exclusive branded communities, encouraging children to be brand-conscious and brand-loyal consumers. Unlike toy advertisers, who did not enter children's popular culture until the television era, food advertisers sold products meant to be consumed daily; as such, brand loyalty was highly sought after. © 2014 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Aronczyk, M., Powers, D., (2010) Blowing up the brand: Critical perspectives on promotional culture, , New York, NY, New York, NY,: Peter Lang; Arvidsson, A., Brands: A critical perspective (2005) Journal of Consumer Culture, 5 (2), pp. 235-258. , doi:10.1177/1469540505053093; Arvidsson, A., (2006) Brands: Meaning and value in media culture, , New York, NY, New York, NY,: Routledge; Banet-Weiser, S., (2007) Kids rule!

In the heavily mediatized struggle, German anti-fascists repeatedly damaged and stole a 22-meter-tall German flag belonging to a family of Lebanese extraction. The flag fight and the media's coverage of it demonstrated competing and overlapping definitions of citizenship, with the media and the flag owners promoting a civic form of nationalism. The case illuminates a national project to redefine German national identity and expand it beyond the boundaries of ethnic nationalism. At the same time, it reveals persistent anxieties about migrant spaces and their place in the nation. © 2014 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Abraham, D., Constitutional patriotism, citizenship, and belonging (2008) International Journal of Constitutional Law, 6 (1), pp. 137-152; Alonso, A.M., The politics of space, time and substance: State formation, nationalism and ethnicity (1994) Annual Review of Anthropology, 23, pp. 379-405; (2011) Einwohnerinnen und Einwohner im Land Berlin am 30.

Accordingly, the article argues that three intertextual mechanisms (canonical recycling, political auteurism, and symptomatic interpretation) both condition the appropriation of horror film texts as legitimate objects-to-be-read and work to sustain discursive power relations between scholastically credentialed and ""nonexpert"" reading subjects. © 2014 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Altman, R., (1999) Film/genre, , London, England, London, England,: BFI Publishing; Beard, W., (2006) The artist as monster: The cinema of David Cronenberg, , Toronto, Canada, Toronto, Canada,: University of Toronto Press; Bennett, T., Texts, readers, reading formations (1983) The Bulletin of the Midwest Modern Language Association, 16 (1), pp. 3-17; Bennett, T., Texts in history: The determination of readings and their texts (1985) The Journal of the Midwest Modern Language Association, 18 (1), pp. 1-16; Bennett, T., Woollacott, J., beyond: The political career of a popular hero (1987) Bond and, , New York, NY, New York, NY,: Methuen; Benshoff, H., (1997) Monsters in the closet: Homosexuality and the horror film, , Manchester,England, Manchester,England,: Manchester University Press; Bernardini, C., Auteurdämmerung: David Cronenberg, George A.

By visibly marking the bodies of wearers and publicly identifying their sexual identities or political views, T-shirts contribute to a broader project of gay and lesbian public visibility that has held a central place in attempts to transform the social and political world. This study draws upon both archival materials and interviews with contemporary wearers of gay- and lesbian-themed T-shirts in order to document the meaningful role that this pervasive yet often-ignored popular medium of visual communication has played and continues to play for gay and lesbian public advocacy and community building. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"(1989) The New York Times, Section, 1, p. 8. , October 7p 80 arrested in a Los Angeles AIDS protest; (1987) The Washington Post, pp. A12. , August 16p AIDS policy protested; Arendt, H., (1958) The human condition, , Chicago, IL, Chicago, IL,: University of Chicago Press; Barker, K., Wheeler, L., (1987) Hundreds of thousands march for gay rights; people from across, pp. A1. , U.S. converge on mall, U.S. converge on mall,: The Washington Post, October 12p; Berlant, L., Freeman, E., Queer nationality (1993) Fear of a queer planet: Queer politics and social theory, pp. 193-229. , In: Warner M., editors Minneapolis, MN, Minneapolis, MN,: University of Minnesota Press, InEd.pp; Crane, D., (2000) Fashion and its social agendas: Class, gender, and identity in clothing, , Chicago, IL, Chicago, IL,: University of Chicago Press; DeLuca, K.M., Unruly arguments: The body rhetoric of Earth First!, ACT UP, and Queer Nation (1999) Argumentation and Advocacy, 36 (1), pp. 9-21; Elliott, S., As the gay and lesbian market grows, a boom in catalogues that are 'out, loud, and proud (1993) The New York Times, pp. D17. , September, September, 10p; Fraser, N., Rethinking the public sphere: A contribution to the critique of actually existing democracy (1990) Social Text, pp. 56-80; Glaser, B.G., Strauss, A.L., (1967) The discovery of grounded theory: Strategies for qualitative research, , London, UK, London, UK,: Wiedenfeld and Nicholson; Goodnow, P., On black panthers, blue ribbons, and peace signs: The function of symbols in social campaigns (2006) Visual Communication Quarterly, 13 (3), pp. 166-179; Green, J., (2003) When political art mattered, p. 69. , The New York Times Magazine, December 7p; Gross, J., (1990) Protest, not poignancy, marks AIDS gathering, pp. B5. , The New York Times, June 21p; Gross, L., (2001) Up from invisibility: Lesbians, gay men, and the media in America, , New York, NY, New York, NY,: Columbia University Press; Gross, L., Woods, J., (1999) The Columbia reader on lesbians & gay men in media, society, and politics, , New York, NY, New York, NY,: Columbia University Press; Habermas, J., (1989) Structural transformation of the public sphere, , Cambridge, MA, Cambridge, MA,: MIT Press; Jackson, E., Persky, S., (1995) Flaunting it!

This article explores the implications of such visibility by focusing on two Finnish reality TV shows: Talent and Big Brother. It is suggested that reality TV shows operate as a site where the definitions of the ordinary and the nation are being circulated, contested, and, at times, stretched. The article demonstrates the ways in which global format, production aims, and audience participation together challenge and expand the concept of Finnishness with transnational dimensions of citizenship and cross-border engagements. However at the same time the persistent nationalism in forms of conflicts and racism pushes through the global format. It is argued that representing difference carries particular contextual commercial value for reality formats applied particularly by strategies of diluting difference and emphasizing conflicts that limit the political potential of these representations. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Aden, S., Refugees forever?

The company's formally distinctive made-for-television documentary films have built a consistent and durable mythology that represents NFL football as heroic, dramatic, and beautiful. Beyond creating, maintaining, and circulating a celebratory image for the league, NFL Films employs various textual and marketing strategies to cast its productions as artworks that are more refined than typical sports television, engage consecrated aesthetic traditions, reflect their producers' inspired creative visions, and are unmotivated by commercial interests-qualities that critical and audience discourses surrounding the company often reinforce. This article examines how NFL Films' aesthetic posturing builds distinction for the subsidiary film production company within the stereotypically lowbrow context of sports television. Moreover, it considers how NFL Films' attempts to situate itself as a site that produces art work to amplify the NFL's economic and cultural value. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Barron, D., July 3Fear not-NFL Films no dinosaur (2008) Houston Chronicle, , http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/sports/fb/texansfront/5869171.html, Retrieved from; Beale, L., Moles, groundmen, and weasels (1977) American Film, 3, pp. 66-67. , November 3; Block, A., The 27th team (1972) Philadelphia Inquirer, pp. 17-22. , December, December, 10pp; Bond, J., Blood, sweat, and tunes (1999) Film Score Monthly, 4 (1), pp. 24-29; Bourdieu, P., (1984) Distinction: A social critique of the judgment of taste, , Cambridge, MA, Cambridge, MA,: Harvard University Press, R.

What emerges in both cases-despite very different institutional, production, and marketing strategies-is that race has strongly determined the career development of black top talent. Racial hierarchies have presented various obstacles hindering the progress of these individuals, but more surprisingly, such hierarchies have also indirectly facilitated their success. They were seized on by Smith, Lassiter, and Perry as both impetus and opportunity. The final section turns to a consideration of the racial implications of their breaking into film's elite ranks, suggesting that neither the racially incorporative nor resistive dimensions of this achievement have been sufficiently considered. © 2013 Copyright Published with license by Taylor & Francis.",,,,,,,,,,"Albiniak, P., Perry's bet on himself pays off handsomely (2011) Daily Variety, , http://global.factiva.com/, (November 11); Aldridge, L., Mythology and affect: The brands of cinematic blackness of Will Smith and Tyler Perry (2011) Spectator: The University of Southern California Journal of Film and Television, 31 (1), pp. 41-47; Als, H., (2010) Mama's gun: The world of Tyler Perry.

We suggest that there has been a lack of attention to race and ethnicity in the booming research field of cultural production studies, and that the few good studies of race, ethnicity, and cultural production have been somewhat marginalized. Following a section that outlines our understandings of ""race"" and ethnicity, we outline the development of research on cultural production, differentiating various approaches according to the degree of attention that they afford to questions of power, inequality, and social justice. We then survey the main themes that have emerged from cultural production studies regarding race and ethnicity, and outline some of the problems associated with such research. We argue that a theory of cultural production that adequately integrates race and ethnicity needs to combine analysis of micro and macro factors, structure and agency, and change and continuity. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Ainley, B., (1998) Black journalists, white media, , Oakhill, United Kingdom, Oakhill,: Trentham Books; Baker, C.E., (2001) Media, markets, and democracy, , Cambridge, United Kingdom, Cambridge,: Cambridge University Press; Balaji, M., Why do good girls have to be bad?

Building on earlier work that recognizes a paradigmatic shift from multiculturalism to cultural diversity, this article identifies a third phase, ""creative diversity."" Creative diversity provides a further incremental depoliticization of race in public service broadcasting contexts. Here, ideas of quality and creativity are foregrounded over (structural) questions of (in)equality or the positive recognition of social and cultural difference. The article situates the rise of creative diversity alongside parallel developments in the ""crisis of multiculturalism,"" UK equality legislative frameworks, and creative industries policy. It is argued that creative diversity shifts the paradigm of the multicultural problem (in public service broadcasting), enables the ""marketization"" of television and multiculture, and ultimately continues to safeguard the interests of public service broadcasting. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,"Arts and Humanities Research Council, AHRC: AH/J011991/1

This study examines several dimensions of this process involving the interplay of incentives, assumptions, and anxieties collectively referred to as the politics of creative strategy.

Following increasing criticism of the artist and his material during 2011, and growing impatience with his controversial public pronouncements, Morrissey has publicly disowned his biggest and longest-running fan site and banned its owner from attending his concerts. I draw on psychological theories of group identity and relationships to try to explain why the relationship between Morrissey and his fans should have deteriorated to such an extent. Also, through a microanalysis of online exchanges, I consider the Morrissey fan community as a case study illustrating some of the changes to fandom in the digital age that have mostly been studied with regard to the fans of cult television series and games. I argue that the online Morrissey community is best explained as a knowledge community in which debate and factionalism play a necessary part, if not always to the taste of its members. © 2013 Copyright Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Abercrombie, N., Longhurst, B., (1998) Audiences: A sociological theory of performance and imagination, , London, UK, London, UK,: Sage; Aron, A., Aron, E.N., Tudor, M., Nelson, G., Close relationships as including other in the self (1991) Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 60, pp. 241-253; Baym, N.K., (2000) Tune in, log on: Soaps, fandom and online community, , Thousand Oaks, CA, Thousand Oaks, CA,: Sage; Baym, N.K., Rethinking the music industry (2010) Popular Communication, 8 (3), pp. 177-180; Baym, N.K., The Swedish model: Balancing markets and gifts in the music industry (2011) Popular Communication, 9 (1), pp. 22-38; Baym, N.K., Burnett, R., Amateur experts: International fan labor in Swedish independent music (2009) International Journal of Cultural Studies, 12 (5), pp. 433-449; Bennett, L., Delegitimizing strategic power: Normative identity and governance in online R.E.M. fandom (2011) Transformative Works and Cultures, 7; Coulter, C., ""A double bed and a stalwart lover for sure"": The Smiths, the death of pop, and the not so hidden injuries of class (2010) Why pamper life's complexities?

Jackson Boulevard, Chicago, IL 60604, United States","This article looks at the rise of Inspector Spacetime Internet fandom as a key component in 21st century fandom. A fictional show-within-a-show on the NBC comedy Community, Inspector Spacetime is ostensibly a parody of Doctor Who. It has also developed its own fan base, mainly through the websites TVTropes.com and Tumblr. I argue that the rise of Inspector Spacetime fandom represents a parody of fandom via the tension between production and consumption in a hypermediated culture. Inspector Spacetime fandom parody is double-edged. It offers both a reverence for and an implicit critique of fan activities through an analysis of Doctor Who. At the same time, Inspector Spacetime fandom reifies the boundaries of fandom even as it critiques fan activities. © 2013 Copyright Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Bacon-Smith, C., (1992) Enterprising women: Television, fandom and the creation of popular myth, , Philadelphia, PA, Philadelphia, PA,: University of Pennsylvania Press; Bakhtin, M.M., (1984) Problems of Dostoevsky's poetics, , In: Emerson C., editors Minneapolis, MN, Minneapolis, MN,: University of Minnesota Press; Barthes, R., (1972) Mythologies, , In: Lavers A., editors New York, NY, New York, NY,: Farrar, Straus and Giroux.

Building upon the theoretical framework of noted fan studies scholar Henry Jenkins, the article focuses on the fan authorship of ESPN.com columnist Bill Simmons and particularly his work in The Book of Basketball, a 2009 New York Times bestseller. Examining the careful means by which Simmons positions himself as ""just another fan,"" it asserts for his authorship an intellectual interest and depth of critical consideration aimed at understanding the subjective entanglement of sporting events and personal narrative. So doing, Simmons demonstrates a range of narrative possibility that problematizes the objective ""reality"" of both sport and self, as well as any understanding of sports fandom as intrinsically unreflexive or uncritical of its consumptive complicity. © 2013 Copyright Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Adorno, T., Horkheimer, M., The culture industry: Enlightenment as mass deception (1993) The cultural studies reader, pp. 29-43. , In: During In S., editors London, UK, London, UK,: Routledge; Auslander, P., (1999) Liveness: Performance in a mediatized culture, , London, UK, London, UK,: Routledge; Boorstin, D., (1962) The image: Or, what happened to the American dream, , New York, NY, New York, NY,: Atheneum; Brooks, P., (1984) Reading for the plot: Design and intention in narrative, , New York, NY, New York, NY,: Knopf; Cooren, F., Communication theory at the center: Ventriloquism and the communicative constitution of reality (2012) Journal of Communication, 62, pp. 1-20; Cowley, R., Introduction (1999) What if?: The world's foremost military historians imagine what might have been, pp. xi-xiv. , In: Cowley R., editors New York, NY, New York, NY,: Putnam; Ferguson, N., Introduction (1997) Virtual history, pp. 1-90. , In: Ferguson N., editors London, UK, London, UK,: Papermac; Gladwell, M., Simmons, B., (2009) ForewordThe book of basketball, pp. ix-xi. , New York, NY, New York, NY,: ESPN Books; Gumbrecht, H.U., (2006) In praise of athletic beauty, , Cambridge, MA, Cambridge, MA,: Belknap; Hess, A., Resistance up in smoke: Analyzing the limitations of deliberation on YouTube (2009) Critical Studies in Media Communication, 26 (5), pp. 411-434; Hills, M., (2002) Fan cultures, , London, UK, London, UK,: Routledge; Jameson, F., (1991) Postmodernism, or, the cultural logic of late capitalism, , Durham, NC, Durham, NC,: Duke University Press; Jenkins, H., (1992) Textual poachers: Television fans and participatory culture, , London, UK, London, UK,: Routledge; Jenkins, H., Never trust a snake (1997) Out of bounds: Sports, media, and the politics of identity, pp. 48-78. , In: Baker A., Boyd T., editors Bloomington, IN, Bloomington, IN,: Indiana University Press; Jenkins, H., (2006) Convergence culture: Where old and new media collide, , New York, NY, New York, NY,: New York University Press; Johnson, D., Fan-tagonism: Factions, institutions, and constitutive hegemonies of fandom (2007) Fandom: Identities and communities in a mediated world, pp. 285-300. , In: Gray J., Sandvoss C., Harrington C.

On the picket line, Buffy creator Joss Whedon discussed new ways online media production could be financed. After the strike, Whedon self-funded a web media production, Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog. Whedon and his collaborators positioned Dr. Horrible as an experiment, investigating whether original online media content created outside of studio funding could be financially viable. Dr. Horrible was a bigger hit than expected, with a paid version topping the iTunes charts and a DVD release hitting the number two position on Amazon. This article explores which factors most obviously contributed to Dr. Horrible's success, whether these factors are replicable by other media creators, the incorporation of fan labor into web media projects, and how web-specific content creation relates to more traditional forms of media production. © 2013 Copyright Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Abbott, S., Dr. Horrible's sing-along blog-a cult TV event without the TV (2009) Critical Studies in Television: TV Reflections, , http://http://www.criticalstudiesintelevision.com/index.php?siid=8871, January; Andrejevic, M., Watching television without pity (2008) Television & New Media, 9 (1), pp. 24-46; Banks, J., Humphreys, S., The labor of user co-creators: Emergent social network markets?

It argues that thinking about the aesthetics of popular music helps us understand how populist logic functions. Examining the music used during the campaign, the inaugural celebration, and the In Performance at the White House series, I show how the aesthetic problems of Obama's musical spectacles are symptomatic of a postpolitical populism that is potentially unstable. Using a number of theories of populism and popular music, in particular those of Ernesto Laclau, Slavoj Žižek, and Stuart Hall, I argue that while the Obama White House effectively utilized a heterogeneous populist aesthetic to structure identification with Obama as a leader to win the 2008 election, its postelection praxis has left it unable to articulate the agonistic pluralism necessary for sustaining an effective political movement, setting the stage for the recuperation of populist affect by the homogenous populism of the right. © 2013 Copyright Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Abcarian, R., Zuckman, J., (2009) JanuaryInspiring song, spirit at Lincoln Memorial concert, , http://articles.latimes.com/2009/jan/19/nation/na-inaug-obama-concert19, LA Times; Adorno, T., (1991) The culture industry: Selected essays on mass culture, , London, UK, London, UK,: Routledge; Adorno, T., Gillespie, S., On popular music (2002) Essays on music, pp. 437-469. , In: Leppert R., editors Berkeley, CA, Berkeley, CA,: University of California Press, Trans; Bageant, J., Audacity, yes; change, hardly: Life in the post-political age (2008) Counterpunch, , http://www.counterpunch.org/2008/07/24/life-in-the-post-political-age/, July; Berezin, M., (2009) Illiberal politics in neoliberal times: Culture, security and populism in the new Europe, , Cambridge, UK, Cambridge, UK,: Cambridge University Press; Betz, H.-G., (1994) Radical right-wing populism in Western Europe, , New York, NY, New York, NY,: St. Martin's Press; Burke, K., Revolutionary symbolism in America (1935) American writers' congress, pp. 87-94. , In: Hart H., editors New York, NY, New York, NY,: International Publishers; Cameron, M., Hershberg, E., (2010) Latin America's left turns: Politics, policies, and trajectories of change, , Boulder, CO, Boulder, CO,: Lynn Reinner Publishers; Crist, E., Aaron Copland and the popular front (2003) Journal of the American Musicological Society, 56 (2), pp. 406-465; Dunaway, D.K., Music and politics in the United States (1987) Folk Music Journal, 5 (3), pp. 268-296; Eco, U., (1989) The open work, , Cambridge, MA, Cambridge, MA,: Harvard University Press; Gilbert, J., Barack Obama's Spotify playist reveals love for No Doubt, Wilco (2012) The Huffington Post, , http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/02/09/barack-obama-spotify-playlist_n_1266372.html, February; Hall, S., Notes on deconstructing 'the popular (1981) Cultural theory and popular culture, pp. 442-453. , In: Story J., editors New York, NY, New York, NY,: Pearson/Prentice Hall; Hazelton, L., How good-looking is my wife?: Suave Obama and stunning Michelle dance the night away with galaxy of stars (2009) Daily Mail, , http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1125102/How-good-looking-wife-Suave-Obama-stunning-Michelle-dance-night-away-galaxy-stars.html, January; Held, J., (1996) Populism in Eastern Europe: Racism, nationalism, and society, , New York, NY, New York, NY,: Columbia University Press; Jackson, M., Is this song your song anymore?: Revisioning Woody Guthrie's ""This Land is Your Land.""

Trumpeted by the media both in Sweden and internationally as an exercise in ""transparent"" and ""democratic"" nation-branding via the use of Twitter, the @Sweden account is ""given"" to a new Swede every week, and, supposedly, these curators are given free rein to tweet what they like, when they like. The use of a popular communication channel by the Swedish government-in this case, Twitter-provides an illuminating example of the carefully planned and managed promotion and nation-branding of Sweden, presented under the guise of a ""transparent"" and ""democratic"" selection and editorial processes. The @Sweden project will be addressed in light of ""liberation technology"" (Diamond, 2010) and ""technology discourse"" (Fisher, 2010) perspectives, within which a correlation between access to, and use of, technology and proactive change is postulated.

This is demonstrated through a survey of viewers attending the James Bond film Quantum of Solace (QoS) at three theatres in the greater London area. Geography emerged as relevant to audiences in three forms. First, geography was understood as a catalyst for resource-based wars, providing an opportunity to reflect on these conflicts and their future likelihood. Second, geography serves as a difference engine for producing tension and excitement. Finally, geography emerged through the situatedness of viewing and rhizomatic nature of subjectivity. However, these geographies must be understood as part of a larger geopolitical assemblage that is animated by audience power. In conclusion, we argue for an understanding of geopolitical space as constituted through audiences' constituent power to produce topologies. While audiences did not transform QoS into a radical text, this potential remains latent. © 2013 Copyright Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Adams, P., (2009) Geographies of media and communication: A critical introduction, , Hoboken, NJ, Hoboken, NJ,: Wiley-Blackwell; Allen, J., (2003) Lost geographies of power, , Oxford, UK, Oxford,: Blackwell; Austin, T., (2002) Hollywood, hype and audiences, , Manchester, UK, Manchester,: Manchester University Press; Appadurai, A., (1996) Modernity at large: Cultural dimensions of globalization, , Minneapolis, MN, Minneapolis, MN,: University of Minnesota Press; Barker, M., I have seen the future and it is not here yet or, on being ambitious for audience research (2006) The Communication Review, 9 (2), pp. 123-141; Barker, M., Brooks, K., (1998) Knowing audiences, , Luton, UK, Luton,: University of Luton Press; Barker, M., Mathijs, E., (2007) Watching the Lord of the Rings: Tolkien's world audiences, , Bern, Switzerland, Bern,: Peter Lang; Berry, C., Kim, S., (2009) Electronic elsewheres: Media, technology, and the experience of social space, , Minneapolis, MN, Minneapolis, MN,: University of Minnesota Press; Billig, M., (1995) Banal nationalism, , London, CA, London, CA, UK and Thousand Oaks, Sage; Black, J., The geopolitics of James Bond (2004) Intelligence and National Security, 19 (2), pp. 290-303; Bratich, J., Amassing the multitude: Revisiting early audience studies (2005) Communication Theory, 15 (3), pp. 242-265; Castells, M., (2000) The rise of the network society, , 2nd, Oxford, UK, Oxford,: Wiley-Blackwell; Chapman, J., (2007) Licence to thrill, , London, UK, London,: I.

We consider how these counter-cultural transformations that shaped new management thinking in Europe and North America traveled to places such as India, where neo-liberal economic reforms led to economic growth alongside unprecedented suffering. Looking across the expansive Indian media landscape, we see the growing prominence of India's own ""cool capitalists"" in the figures of Rajat Gupta and Aamir Khan. Khan's hit talk show Satyamev Jayate helps to popularize this new management culture establishing a new set of moral claims over the future of economic development in the global South.

Such popularity is at first sight puzzling. After all, Arabs lived under Ottoman rule for 400 years, and for most of the 20th century Turkey's foreign policy neglected Arab interests. Why, then, would Turkish drama be popular with Arab audiences, especially at a time of unprecedented vibrancy in Arab cultural production? This article grapples with that question via a systematic analysis of pan-Arab discourse about Turkish popular culture, concluding that some Turkish dramas conjure up an accessible modernity while others enact a counter-hegemonic narrative that puts Middle Easterners in the role of heroes. The rise of Turkish television drama in the Arab public sphere offers insights into the geopolitical underpinnings and geocultural consequences of transnational media flows. © 2013 Copyright Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"(2008) 84.5 million Arabs watched the last episode of Nour series, , http://www.mbc.net, November 10.

It draws on Rick Altman's method of crisis historiography to contextualize the fragmentation of mobile television's technologies and the confusion that this fragmentation has bred amongst consumers, industry professionals, analysts, and academics. To examine mobile television's ""identity crisis,"" I trace how this identity crisis has impacted and has been impacted by changing conceptions of the identities of the two media that mobile television endeavors to merge: the cellular phone and television. Based on this case study, I argue that the identity crises that accompany the arrivals of new media technologies do not take place in isolation, but rather have consequences that influence our attitudes toward and engagements with other, more established media. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Aguando, J.M., Martínez, I.J., The construction of the mobile experience: The role of advertising campaigns in the appropriation of mobile phone technologies (2007) Continuum, 21 (2), pp. 137-148; Altman, R., (2005) Silent film sound, , New York, NY: Columbia University Press; Andrews, R., (2008) Mobile TV has failed, but there's still hope, , http://moconews.net/article/419-mobile-tv-has-failed-but-theres-still-hope-report/, (November 11); Beacham, F., (2005) Antenna myths: Who's really watching free TV?, , http://www.tvtechnology.com/big-picture/0170/antenna-myths-whos-really-watching-free-tv/184383/, (June 22); Benjamin, S., Evaluating the Federal Communications Commission's national television ownership cap: What's bad for broadcasting is good for the country (2004) William and Mary Law Review, 46 (2), pp. 440-511; Boddy, W., (2004) New media and popular imagination: Launching radio, television, and digital media in the United States, , London, England: Oxford University Press; Boddy, W., ""Is it TV yet?""

Bravo's discursive construction of its audience as ""affluencers"" centers around its strategy of featuring prototypic affluencers in its programming, a tactic reinforced through cross-promotional efforts. Cross-promotion operates as a powerful tool in Bravo's work to discursively define and concentrate the audience commodity it in turn sells to advertisers.

Operating alongside conventional historical treatments, popular culture presents visions of presidents, and Clinton in particular, that are in many ways more intimate and more multifaceted than those found in traditional biography. This analysis considers three such popular culture texts that all feature Clinton as a main character-the 1996 novel Primary Colors, the 2003 novel The X President, and the 2010 HBO film The Special Relationship. Specifically, I explore how each of these texts enliven an understanding of Clinton through their constructions of him as a chronotope-a character firmly defined by his placement within a particular temporal-spatial nexus.

Although a restricted field of film production has arisen beside the large-scale field, including an elite critical discourse, the film industry remains relentlessly oriented to its goal of producing commercial products that achieve widespread popular appeal. This differentiation becomes apparent in the types of films validated by publics, peers, and critics. Our exploratory analysis examines whether the dichotomy of artistic versus popular forms of criticism still captures the complexity of films produced under conditions of increased commercialization, globalization, and digitization. We analyzed reviews published in newspapers of record in the United Kingdom and United States of films released in 2007 that received the utmost popular, professional, and critical recognition. Findings reveal that contemporary film criticism incorporates aesthetic elements drawn from popular interests as well as elite art considerations, thereby complicating critics' aesthetic systems and analysts' classificatory schemes. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,"277-45-001","This research was supported by the Erasmus Trustfund and by the Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research as part of the VICI project Cultural Classification Systems in Transition (NWO project #277-45-001).

Introducing the concept of a ""lens of detection,"" it argues that the media coverage portrayed Lambert as a closeted gay man and encouraged viewers to watch his onscreen performances for clues that supposedly confirmed this identity. As Lambert remained queerly ambiguous in the series' broadcasts, the media's insistence on his gayness functioned to close off the disruption that he posed to the gay/straight binary as a gender-nonconforming performer who refused to disclose his sexuality. This media-imposed lens of detection has significant implications for how audiences may be positioned to understand queer representations in media texts: by pushing viewers to make sense of nonnormative performances of self through hegemonic gender norms, it limits the possibilities for representations to challenge-and discourages viewers from thinking outside of-dominant understandings of sexuality. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Auslander, P., (2006) Performing glam rock: Gender and theatricality in popular music, , Ann Arbor: University of Michigan Press; Azzopardi, C., A queer ""Idol""?

However, drawing on the potential of popular culture to resist heteronormativity, this article argues that representations of gay domesticity can also be interpreted in terms of queer resistance. To this end, a textual thematic analysis of Brothers & Sisters and Six Feet Under was conducted to illustrate how these instances of resistance are articulated. This analysis has shown that the series rely on strategies of queer deconstructions to expose how heteronormativity governs and restrains gay domestic arrangements. They also rely on strategies of queer reconstructions to renegotiate gay domesticities in which the boundaries defined by the discourse of heteronormativity are defied, transgressed, and queered. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Avila-Saavedra, G., Nothing queer about queer television: Televized construction of gay masculinities (2009) Media, Culture & Society, 31 (1), pp. 5-21; Becker, R., (2006) Gay TV and straight America, , New Brunswick, NJ: Rutgers University Press; Berlant, L., Intimacy: A special issue (2000) Intimacy, pp. 1-8. , In: Berlant L., editors Chicago, IL: The University of Chicago Press; Berlant, L., Warner, M., Sex in public (1998) Critical Inquiry, 24 (2), pp. 547-566; Butler, J., (1999) Gender trouble: Feminism and the subversion of identity, , London, England: Routledge; Chambers, S.A., (2009) The queer politics of television, , London, England and New York, NY: I.

Upon closer inspection, news parody appears as a truly universal phenomenon; in any culture where television is used as a means of disseminating authoritative information about the real, parody-what some have labeled, or mislabeled ""fake news""-plays an increasingly important discursive function. In this article, we provide an overview of international forms of news parody and political satire as they take shape across continents and cultures. We consider the global flow of parody formats, and the multiple ways in which news parody adapts to differing political, economic, and regulatory contexts. Further, we explore the semiotic labor that parody performs in deconstructing broadcast news and wider discourses of authority. Finally, we discuss the political significance of global news parody and the role the genre plays as a popular response to power. © 2012 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Alger, D., (1998) Megamedia: How giant corporations dominate mass media, distort competition, and endanger democracy, , New York, NY: Rowman & Littlefield; Bakhtin, M., (1981) The dialogic imagination, , In: Emerson C., Holquist M., Holquist M., editors Austin, TX: University of Texas Press; Baym, G., The Daily Show: Discursive integration and the reinvention of political journalism (2005) Political Communication, 22 (3), pp. 259-276; Baym, G., Representation and the politics of play: Stephen Colbert's Better Know a District (2007) Political Communication, 24 (4), pp. 359-376; Baym, G., (2010) From Cronkite to Colbert: The evolution of broadcast news, , Boulder, CO: Paradigm Publishers; Boyer, D., Yurchak, A., American Stiob: Or, what late -Socialist aesthetics of parody reveal about contemporary political culture in the West (2010) Cultural Anthropology, 25 (2), pp. 179-221; Day, A., (2011) Satire and dissent: Interventions in contemporary political debate, , Bloomington, IN: Indiana University Press; Foucault, M., (1980) Power/knowledge: Selected interviews and other writings, pp. 1972-1977. , In: Gordon C., Marshall L., Mepham J., Soper K., editors New York, NY: Pantheon Books; Hariman, R., Political parody and public culture (2008) Quarterly Journal of Speech, 94 (3), pp. 247-272; Holbert, R.L., Lambe, J.L., Dudo, A.D., Carlton, K.A., Primacy effects of The Daily Show and national TV news viewing: Young viewers, political gratifications, and internal political self-efficacy (2007) Journal of Broadcasting & Electronic Media, 51 (1), pp. 20-38; Jones, J.P., (2010) Entertaining politics: Satiric television and political engagement, , Lanham, MD: Rowman and Littlefield Publishers; Kristof, N.D., The power of mockery (2011) New York Times, , http://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/17/opinion/17kristof.html, April 16); Nichols, B., (1991) Representing reality: Issues and concepts in documentary, , Bloomington, IN: Indiana University Press; (2003) NOW with Bill Moyers, , http://www.pbs.org/now/transcript/transcript_stewart.html, PBS.

It investigates the process by which these shows, both based on successful Western formats, ""Indianize"" themselves and find audiences at a new cultural site. It argues that the shows adapt themselves to the Indian cultural milieu in distinct ways by aligning themselves along a postcolonial social rift that is differentiated by language. By appealing to these culturally distinct audiences and tapping into the unique sensibilities that each of them represents the shows construct hybrid identities from global formats in innovative ways. Through this exploration, this article ponders over the inherent paradoxes within global cultural flows and echoes calls for a dialectical approach to studying it. © 2012 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Appadurai, A., Disjuncture and difference in the global cultural economy (1990) Theory, Culture & Society, 7 (2), pp. 295-310; Arogyasami, M., Shakespeare's treatment of comic sentiment (Hasya Rasa): An Indian perspective (1994) Acting funny: Comic theory and practice in Shakespeare's plays, pp. 153-163. , In: Teague F., editors Cranbury, NJ: Associated University Presses; Baym, G., The Daily Show: Discursive integration and the reinvention of political journalism (2005) Political Communication, 22 (3), pp. 259-276; Canclini, N.G., Hybrid cultures, oblique powers (2006) Media and culture studies: Keyworks, pp. 422-444. , In: Durham M.

I argue that given the widespread skepticism toward the unfulfilled promises of the post-socialist transition and the European Union (EU) accession, the show's ability to curb Romanians' disaffection from politics is remarkable. Positioning Romanians as active television viewers and gatekeepers against practices of manipulation and incorrect uses of the Romanian language, the show fosters discursive contestation and activates a desire for political engagement. My discussion introduces the notion of ""national linguistic intimacy"" to evoke how the show strives to naturalize the affective ties with the national community by reusing the flavor of Romanian comedic and satirical literature and encouraging language play. © 2012 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Aslama, M., Pantti, M., Flagging Finnishness: Reproducing national identity in reality television (2007) Television and New Media, 8 (1), pp. 49-67; Baym, G., The Daily Show: Discursive integration and the reinvention of political journalism (2005) Political Communication, 22, pp. 259-276; Baym, G., (2009) From Cronkite to Colbert: The evolution of broadcast news, , Boulder, CO: Paradigm; Bennett, J., A feeling of insincerity: Politics, ventriloquy, and the dialectics of gesture (2009) The rhetoric of sincerity, pp. 195-213. , In: van Alphen E., Bal M., Smith C., editors Stanford, CA: Stanford University Press; Bonsaver, G., (2007) Censorship and literature in Fascist Italy, , Toronto, Canada: University of Toronto Press; Boyer, D., Yurchak, A., American stiob: Or, what late-socialist aesthetics of parody reveal about contemporary political culture in the West (2010) Cultural Anthropology, 25 (2), pp. 179-221; Bujenita, A., (2005) Cronica Cârcotaşilor: O cacofonie de care Românica avea nevoie.

I then examine the depiction of other Arab leaders in Eretz Nehederet (2003-present), highlighting the continuous dominance of the ""Israelification"" framing strategy as a mode of hegemonic cooptation.

It represented a new mix of genres and assisted network Canal+ to counterprogram successfully and build a brand identity.

I discuss the long-running Hungarian postsocialist satirical talk show Heti Hetes as a linchpin between late socialist and late capitalist forms of political satire. The program bears the characteristics and legacies of both and reveals unexpected similarities between public discourses otherwise radically separated into two different political systems during the Cold War. Heti Hetes provides the ground for a multilevel analysis, which accounts for the national specificities of a long legacy of political cabaret as well as the shared regional circumstances of late socialism.

The second part of the article is based on a textual analysis of a number of segments from various episodes, which I selected in order to provide an account of the techniques, themes, and language adopted by the show.

This phenomenon marks an important application of the postmodern journalistic practices of strategy-framing, hyper-personalization, and media meta-coverage. In a hybrid media environment in which the distinction between information and entertainment is obsolete, these journalistic practices can be applied to people and texts that fall outside the traditional political context. The complex dynamics among Palin, Fey, and the press provide an opportunity to move away from a linear model of ""effects"" toward treatment of the communication cycle itself as the object of inquiry. In this analysis, news coverage of Palin and Fey serves as the textual embodiment of Carey's (1989) notion of the ""arena of dramatic forces and action"" (p. 21) that is the news. Textual analysis is employed to explore how the coverage of Palin's campaign featured both Fey and Palin in a strategically framed, hyper-personalized, meta-coverage narrative. © 2011 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Adams, G., (2008) Fey wants role to end Nov 5, pp. B5. , October 4, The Seattle Post Intelligencer; Baudrillard, J., (1994) Simulacra and simulation, , Ann Arbor, MI: The University of Michigan Press; Baym, G., (2010) From Cronkite to Colbert: The evolution of broadcast news, , Boulder, CO: Paradigm; Benac, N., Images from campaign 2008 (2008) Fist bumps and lipstick, , The Associated Press, November 3, Retrieved from Lexis-Nexis Academic; Bennett, W.L., (2007) News: The politics of illusion, , 7th, New York, NY: Longman; Buckman, A., (2008) Rock star Tina racks up Emmys, , September 22 2008.

Programs that center on black characters demonstrate television's temporal pluralities in that they often make blackness a commodity pleasure but only raise issues of power and privilege endemic to racial difference in discrete, bounded ways. At the same time, television's representations of blackness demonstrate how television in the context of convergence enables unique viewing positions for minority audiences. Using Mary Ann Doane's notion of television's multiple temporal orders, I cast blackness as a contradiction throughout the narratives and distribution contexts characteristic of the contemporary medium. © 2011 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Anderson, C., Disneyland (1994) Television: The critical view, pp. 70-86. , In: Newcomb H., editors 5th, New York, NY: Oxford University Press; Banet-Weiser, S., (2007) Kids rule!

These ads offer an opportunity to examine the ways in which alternative perceptions of the ""sense of place"" are presented. The ads were mapped and categorized according to their position on an axis representing changes in the attitude of the elderly population in Israel to the concept of home, with the two poles defined as ""building a home"" and ""dismantling a home."" Analysis focused on the specific aspect of moving away from home. This discourse contains two interconnected levels, the private home and the national home, which interact on four dimensions: (1) Physical-reference to the dwelling itself; (2) Social-reference to the role of family, friends, and social activities offered; (3) Cultural-reference to the leisure activities offered; and (4) Economic-reference to the residence as a property. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Almog, O., (1997) The Sabra-A profile, , Tel Aviv, Israel: Am Oved Publishers (in Hebrew); Bachelard, G., (1964) The poetics of space, , New York, NY: Orion Press; Barthes, R., The rhetoric of the image (1977) Image-music-text, pp. 32-51. , In S.

Drawing on literature from fashion and dress, we examine how players choose avatar appearance in relation to participation or alignment with groups and their prevailing social norms.We found that although Second Life provides unprecedented freedom in appearance, local social contexts, as much as external ones, created powerful boundaries and expectations, leading many participants to seek socially acceptable appearance that would be interpreted in certain ways as part of their interactions. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Bertozzi, E., I am shocked, shocked!: Taboo breaking in digital gameplay (2008) Loading...

The Hills presents a world of female friendships which is potentially continuous with the peer socialization of teen viewers and, as such, I argue offers a template to examine the importance of peer conversations in the construction of young female identities. In this article I draw on Harré's (1995) theory of social positioning to examine conversations around a particular confrontational incident in The Hills. Analysis of these interactions helps to make visible the roles of different types of conversation and interlocutors in the shaping of identity. I conclude that the ways in which this television program imparts modes of communication to young viewers reveals much about the importance of confrontation in conversational exchanges during the formative years. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Aapola, S., Gonick, M., Harris, A., (2005) Girlhood, power and social change, , New York, NY: Palgrave Macmillan; Allan, G., (1989) Friendship, , Hertfordshire, England: Harvester Wheatsheaf; Andersson, L.M., Pearson, C.M., Tit for tat?

The first is that regional media corporations represent a greater threat to local media production than global media corporations. Second, the threat often consists in seeking to co-opt rather than to suppress local media production, since these regional corporations do not actually stand to benefit from suppressing local production. Third, the likelihood of being co-opted, accompanied by a gradual loss of autonomy, is greatest where local media have achieved a high level of success at attracting relatively large audiences, independently of both regional and global media networks.

Recent events in countries such as Mozambique, Iran, Tunisia, and Egypt have again raised questions about the role new media technologies can play to create alternative public spheres and mobilize for social action. In the African context, where access to new media technologies is marked by big divides, the widespread uptake of mobile phones has led to renewed optimism about the potential they hold for stimulating political participation and widening democratic debate. This article examines various approaches to the relation between mobile phones and participatory democracy, and argues that mobile phones do not only transmit political information needed for rational deliberation in the public sphere, but also transgress cultural and social borders and hierarchies in the way they refashion identities and create informal economies and communicative networks. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Mozambique ""blocked texts"" during food riots (2010) BBC News Africa, , BBC, (September 14); Benjamin, C., Malema's ""ban Twitter"" gets international titter (2010) Business Day, , http://www.businessday.co.za/articles/Content.aspx?id=125804, (November 4), Retrieved from; Berger, G., 1001 uses for a cellphone (2008) Mail & Guardian, , http://www.mg.co.za/article/2008-10-16-1-uses-for-a-cellphone, (October 18), Retrieved from; Berger, G., (2010) Why telecoms operators will trump broadcasters, , http://nml.ru.ac.za/blog/guy-berger/2010/11/28/why-telecoms-operators-will-trump-digital-broadcasters.html, (November 28), Retrieved from; Castells, M., (1998) End of millennium, , Oxford, England: Wiley-Blackwell; (2009) Mobile phones: The new talking drums of everyday Africa, , De Bruijn, M., Nyamnjoh, F., & Brinkman, I.

O. Box 279, South Africa","Willems, W., Department of Media Studies, School of Literature and Language Studies (SLLS), University of the Witwatersrand, P. O. Box 279, South Africa","In African Studies, political cartoons and comic strips have frequently been analyzed in relation to concepts of power and resistance and considered as ways in which those subject to power challenge the rulers (Mason, 2002; Mbembe, 2001; Nyamnjoh, 2009). To a certain extent, these studies have reflected the wider debate on the role of humor in the relation between rulers and ruled in the postcolony. In media and cultural studies, scholars have analyzed comics primarily as ideological texts which offer a particular framing of reality. Drawing on the Zimbabwean comic strip Chikwama, which was published in the Zimbabwean privately owned newspaper The Daily News in the early 2000s, this article argues that postcolonial laughter does not always address those in power, but humor may also point fingers at those subject to power in an attempt to make readers cope with the tragic events unfolding around them. Laughter frequently adopts a self-reflexive mode through which those subject to power mock their own powerlessness and lack of agency in the face of a system that they perceive as immutable. Furthermore, the strip Chikwama also highlights how media discourse came to reflect the way in which politics slowly invaded the lives of ordinary Zimbabweans, hereby reinforcing the importance of treating media texts as embedded in broader social discourses. The comic strip Chikwama did not only replicate the particular institutional ideology of The Daily News but also mirrored the way in which ordinary Zimbabweans negotiated the social and economic impact of the crisis on an everyday basis. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Allan, S., (1999) News culture, , Milton Keynes, England: Open University Press; Arntsen, H., Committing journalism?

I conducted participant observation with the state channel (RTNC1), the pro-government private TV station (DigitalCongo), the editorial board of the television journal Journal Télévisé en Lingala Facile broadcasting on the state channel and on various private TV stations, and the presidential press. In addition, I held formal and informal interviews with journalists working for TV stations that are critical towards the government and also with journalist writing for newspapers.

These products promise to erase cravings leading to overconsumption and aid the consumer in shedding the baggage of modernity. The marketplace success, evidenced by the proliferation of products claiming to contain Hoodia, is not because these products claim to accomplish what all diet programs and products do; if Hoodia assisted simple weight loss, it would not have as powerful a place in the American imaginary: all other diet aids claim the same thing. Hoodia's mythic status is achieved because the narrative surrounding the Southern African succulent touches something deeper in the American psyche: marketing strategies connect themselves with the powerful desire to return, at least symbolically and temporarily, to prelapsarian, Edenic locations, where magical consumables promising to erase the malaises of postindustrial societies still exist in museumized perpetuity. Furthermore, the claim that Hoodia can actually divest the consumer of the desire to consume is, in the American landscape of overabundancy and foodbombardment, almost as powerful as an antidote to death.

I argue that these discursive exchanges not only shaped the expressive culture that was produced during this era, but they also helped to define and refine the occupational identities of the corporate executives that oversaw the production and distribution of children's radio programs. In so doing, I seek to complicate the typical political economic argument that commercial interests undermined radio's social/educational value by examining how consumer culture was reframed by industry participants as having positive values to impart to children so long as it was properly managed. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Balio, T., (1996) Grand Design: Hollywood As a Modern Business Enterprise, 1930-1939, , Berkeley, CA: University of California Press; Boemer, M.L., (1989) The Children's Hour: Radio Programs For Children, 1929-1956, , Metuchen, NJ: Scarecrow Press; Bourdieu, P., (1993) The Field of Cultural Production: Essays On Art and Literature, , New York, NY: Columbia; Bruce, S., Crawford, B., (1995) Cerealizing America: The Unsweetened Story of American Breakfast Cereal, , Boston, MA: Saber and Faber; Caldwell, J.T., Cultures of production: Studying industry's deep texts, reflexive rituals, and managed selfdisclosures (2009) Media Industries: History, Theory and Method, pp. 199-212. , In J.

At the core of the debate was a struggle to reconcile an increasingly integrated transatlantic television market with traditional assumptions about culture and its authentic connection to space and place. The interest in the remake not only created a space where certain national differences were played out and performed but also facilitated an equally compelling transatlantic dialogue about creative ownership, appropriation, and a network's responsibility to its audiences. In doing so, the media attention highlighted how television formats are best understood not as innocuous commodities of international trade but as potential sites of articulation, contestation, and community in an increasingly transnational television environment. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Andreeva, N., UK's 'Coupling.'

This article uses the case of Swedish independent music labels, musicians, and fans to articulate one model for understanding the new roles each can take in this new context. Interviews, participant observation, and popular media coverage are used to show how labels and musicians in this scene loosely organize with fans to create a gift economy among themselves. Although they seek to earn money, they are not focused getting it from the audience. Instead, they engage the audience as equals with whom they can build a larger community that benefits them all. The article shows how they use giving songs away and engaging directly with audience members through the internet to pursue this goal. In contrast to discourses against file sharing, the analysis demonstrates how media producers may reconcile themselves to the participatory culture of the Internet. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,"Since mid 1990s, the conjunction of the Internet and market economies has also proven fraught. Until 1994, the internet was funded primarily by the US National Science Foundation, and advertising and commerce were tightly restricted (Abbatte, 2000). The informal economy that arose online was mostly based on gifts, as people used Usenet groups, bulletin boards, mailing lists, chat, and other forums to share resources in public so that all would benefit (Barbrook, 1998; Rheingold, 1993). Increasingly, the internet has been “colonized by a culture based on accumulating” (Ippolito, 2001, p. 159), as large profit-driven corporations have become dominant forces (consider, e.g., Google and Facebook). Terranova (2000, p. 36) drew attention to the importance of the internet’s original and continuing gift economy in providing a “labor force” for the “larger digital economy” and described the digital economy’s reliance on free labor as indicative of “the reproduction of the labor force in late capitalism as a whole.” In a paper focusing on music fans’ attitudes toward providing free labor, Baym and Burnett (2009) showed that fans active in promoting bands have tacit and explicit strategies for balancing the tension between the effort they expend and the rewards they receive. The potential for corporate exploitation of “user-generated” gift economies is ever present.",,"Abbate, J., (2000) Inventing the Internet, , Cambridge, MA: MIT Press; Baym, N.K., The new shape of online community: The example of Swedish independent music fandom (2007) First Monday, 12 (8). , http://firstmonday.org/issues/issue12_8/baym/index.html; Baym, N.K., Burnett, R., Amateur experts: International fan labor in Swedish independent music (2009) International Journal of Cultural Studies, 12 (5), pp. 433-449; Barbrook, R., The high-tech gift economy (1998) First Monday, 3 (12). , http://www.uic.edu/htbin/cgiwrap/bin/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/631/552; Benkler, Y., (2006) The Wealth of Networks: How Social Production Transforms Markets and Freedom, , New Haven, CT: Yale University Press; Bergquist, M., Ljungberg, J., The power of gifts: Organizing social relationships in open source communities (2001) Journal of Information Systems, 11, pp. 305-320; Blau, P., (1964) Exchange and Power In Social Life, , New York, NY:Wiley; Briggs, A., Burke, P., (2009) A Social History of the Media: From Gutenberg to The Internet, , 3rd ed, Cambridge, England: Polity; Burgess, J., Green, J., (2009) YouTube: Online Video and Participatory Culture, , Cambridge, England: Polity; Condry, I., Cultures of music piracy: An ethnographic comparison of the U.S. and Japan (2004) International Journal of Cultural Studies, 7 (3), pp. 343-363; Dena, C., Emerging participatory culture practices: Player-created tiers in alternate reality (2008) Convergence, 14, pp. 41-57; Deuze, M., Participation, remediation, bricolage: Considering principal components of a digital culture (2006) The Information Society, 22 (2), pp. 63-75; Fonarow, W., (2006) Empire of Dirt, , Middletown, CT: Wesleyan University Press; Goldman, D., (2010) Music's Lost Decade: Sales Cut In Half, , http://money.cnn.com/2010/02/02/news/companies/napster_music_industry/?hpt=P1, February 3; Hellekson, K., A fannish field of value: Online fan gift culture (2009) Cinema Journal, 48 (4), pp. 113-118; Hyde, L., (1983) The Gift: Imagination and The Erotic Life of Property, , New York, NY: Random House; (2009) Recorded Music Sales 2008, , IFPI, London, England: The International Federation of the Phonographic Industry; Ippolito, J., Whatever happened to the gift economy?

We focus particularly on whether the show, as some critics have claimed, has altered the power relationship between the media and the audience. Theoretically, we follow Couldry's (2000) framework and consider the media's construction of the symbolic boundary separating the ""media world"" and the ""ordinary world"" as crucial to the legitimization of media power. Based on an analysis of media discourses, review of publicized materials about the show's organization, and a focus group study on young female audience members, we contend that the Super Girls' Voice has involved a temporary suspension of the media/ordinary boundary. Yet the boundary was re-established toward the end of the show, thus relegitimizing media power. The audience members, meanwhile, were largely complicit throughout the process: They both enjoyed the temporary suspension and the ultimate re-establishment of the media/ordinary boundary. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Andrejevic, M., (2004) Reality TV: The work of being watched, , Lanham, MD: Rowman & Littlefield; Bell-Jordan, K.E., Black, white and a survivor of the real world: Constructions of race on reality TV (2008) Critical Studies in Media Communication, 25 (4), pp. 353-372; Berry, C., Shanghai television's documentary channel: Chinese television as public space (2009) TV China, pp. 40-55. , In Y.

In the summer of 2007, media coverage of Indian Idol focused on how people in Northeast India cast aside decades-old separatist identities to mobilize support for Amit Paul and Prashant Tamang, the two finalists from the region. Situating this media phenomenon in relation to the changing landscape of Indian television and the socio-historical context of ethno-national politics in Northeast India, I explore how reality television, combined with mobile media technologies and practices, has enabled new modes of cultural and political expression. Positing the notion of ""mobile publics,"" I argue that participatory cultures surrounding television create possibilities for the renewal of everyday forms of interaction in public settings that may have been forgotten, subdued, or made impossible under certain political circumstances. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Aiyar, S., Chopra, A., (2000) Star Plus: The great gamble, , http://www.india.today.com/itoday/20000717/cover.html, (July 17), Retrieved from; Bajpai, S., How Doordarshan spends Rs. 133 crores (1985) TV and video world, 21. , (February); Bamzai, K., Real politics: As regionalism powers Prashant Tamang to Indian Idol status, voting has emerged as the biggest winner in reality shows (2007) India Today, p. 62. , (October 8); Bamzai, K., Ticket TO RISE (2007) India Today, p. 45. , (December 31); Bamzai, K., Winds of change (2007) India Today, p. 222. , (October 23); Baruah, S., (2005) Durable disorder: Understanding the politics of Northeast India, , New Delhi, India: Oxford University Press; Bhandari, G.S., Making of an Indian Idol (2006) India Today, p. 45. , (February 28); Bhandari, G., Voting right (2006) India Today, p. 82. , (January 30); Bhandari, G.S., Bamzai, K., The new TV stars (2005) India Today, pp. 27-33. , (October 31); Bhattacharjee, K., Northeastern India: Satellite TV's forgotten spectator (2005) Flow, 2 (5). , http://flowtv.org/?p=581, Retrieved from; Chatterjee, P., (1993) The nation and its fragments, , Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press; Chatterjee, P., Beyond the nation?

This article reveals the scale and significance formatted television content has attained, drawing on a case study analysis of US schedules from the 2007-2008 broadcast season. The high share of formatted programming found in primetime schedules (an average of 33% of broadcast hours) becomes understandable in light of the context and the advantages formats have for broadcasters and producers. The findings suggest that the franchising of content, both expression and outcome of television's commercial saturation, will continue to play a crucial role in TV schedules around the world. This franchising will contribute to the convergence of television globally, not just structurally but also in terms of concrete, albeit locally modified, content. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Adalian, J., CBS leans on ""Brother"" during strike (2007) Variety, , http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117975459.html?categoryid=1066&cs=1, (November 6), Retrieved from; Ang, I., (1996) Living room wars: Rethinking media audiences for a postmodern world, , New York, NY: Routledge; (2009) Study on the application of measures concerning the promotion of the distribution and production of European works in audiovisual media services, , Attentional, Ramboll Management, Oliver & Ohlbaum Associates & Headway International., Report for the European Commission; (2008) Annual Review 2007/08, , www.bbcworldwide.com/annualreviews/review2008, Retrieved from; Bielby, D., Harrington, C.L., (2008) Global TV: Exporting television and culture in the world market, , New York, NY: New York University Press; Bignell, J., (2005) Big Brother: Reality TV in the twenty-first century, , Basingstoke, England: Palgrave Macmillan; Biltereyst, D., Language and culture as ultimate barriers?

It goes on to propose that conceptual coherence can only be achieved for this concept if it is considered historically and in evolutionary terms. The article then pursues recent changes in the status of ""the message"" through four phases of semiotic history-(1) the representative (modern), (2) the excessive (postmodern), (3) the productive (user-created), and (4) the message as human identity-Homo nuntius.

While analyzing Ceca, the authors try to account for this paradoxical popularity while contributing to an understanding of the relationship between popular culture and politics in the former Yugoslavia. On the basis of in-depth interviews with young female students in the two most ""Western"" republics of former Yugoslavia, Slovenia and Croatia, the authors address a simple question: Why does Ceca continue to be so popular in these two countries? The research reveals that Ceca and turbo-folk discourses flourish because they promote and promise a new type of personal empowerment in an era of rapid institutional and value changes in post-socialist Slovenia and Croatia.

Post-2000 seasons of The Real World contain two different portraits of multiracialism that appeal to viewers across the political spectrum. The liberalism in these seasons comes from multiracialism functioning as a liberal utopia free of racism, one where fluidity, not hostility, defines race relations. At the same time, these seasons appeal to conservative sensibilities by making multiracial cast members models of neoliberal self-management that conservatives recently have used to justify dismantling the welfare state and civil rights initiatives. While neither the liberal nor the conservative portraits of multiracialism on post-2000 seasons of The Real World appear to be overtly racist, I unearth subtext where The Real World articulates multiracialism to white supremacy and anti-blackness. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Anderson, C., (1994) Hollywood TV: The studio system in the fifties, , Austin: University of Texas Press; Barrett, D., Dude, where's my vote: Republican voter drive heads to MTV (2004) The Associated Press State and Local Wire, , March 23; Bell-Jordan, K.E., Black.

Orphan works are works for which the copyright owners cannot be identified or located. The fact that a particular work is ""orphaned"" makes it impossible to clear the rights and to legally reutilize the work. This article describes and evaluates six different possible regulatory solutions to the orphan works problem, including extended collective licensing and compulsory licensing. The article concludes that if one wants to make the vast European audiovisual cultural heritage available for future usage, regulatory intervention is indispensable. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"(1971) Berne convention for the protection of literary and artistic works, , http://www.wipo.int/export/sites/www/treaties/en/ip/berne/pdf/trtdocs_wo001.pdf, Berne Convention, Paris Act of July 24, 1971, as amended on September 28, 1979.

In documentary storytelling, reuse of copyrighted material such as footage and music is of great importance. This requires filmmakers to get permission from right holders, obtain a license, or invoke fair use under copyright law. As most documentarians must handle copyright issues in production, copyright law is influencing the practice of documentary filmmaking in various ways. This article presents a study of Norwegian filmmakers' experiences with and attitudes toward copyright. A key finding is a widespread uncertainty on copyright issues in general and in terms of invoking exception from copyright, such as fair use, in particular.

Box 7802, Bergen 5020, Norway","This article examines how new digital technologies have influenced the working day of the documentary staff in the Norwegian public service channel NRK. It examines whether the digitization has changed the way they think about their work. Through interviews with journalists, editors, and other staff in the factual department of NRK, the article asks how the creators of documentary programs experience the new digital working day. Do they find their situation better than before, and, in their opinion, have the documentary programs themselves changed as a result of the new ""working tools""? Does digital technology pave the way for a more flexible process from the first idea to the final airing of the program, allowing for more creativity and impulsiveness? The article also looks at what organizational changes, if any, digitization has led to in the factual department of NRK, and the potential consequences. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Avilés, J.A.G., Leon, B., Journalistic practice in digital television newsroom: The case of Spain's Tele 5 and Antena 3 (2002) Journalism, 3 (3), pp. 355-371; Avilés, J.A.G., Leon, B., Sanders, K., Harrison, J., Journalists at digital television newsrooms in Britain and Spain: Workflow and multi-skilling in a competitive environment (2004) Journalism Studies, 5 (1), pp. 87-100; Bechmann Petersen, A., Realizing cross media (2007) Ambivalence towards convergence: Digitalization and media change, pp. 57-72. , In T.
