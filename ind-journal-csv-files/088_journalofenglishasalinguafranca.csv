In the corpus, Japanese employees communicate once a month with Filipino employees via computer software to confirm infrastructure status at a Filipino company's factories. Comparative constructions frequently appear in the corpus because of the nature of the interactions, but the kinds and frequencies of comparative constructions change month to month. This study demonstrates that early in the corpus, the speakers utilized a multitude of comparative constructions, but after 12 months, the speakers have settled on one preferred comparative construction. Furthermore, the preferred construction emerged from repair sequences, which suggests that repair is significantly related to linguistic feature selection. Accordingly, this study hypothesizes that repair sequences do far more than just resolve an interactional problem; repaired linguistic features are more likely to be selected again the next time a similar linguistic feature is relevant to the progression of the interaction. © 2019 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.","accommodation; competition; constructions; feature selection; repair sequences",,,,,,"Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, JSPS: JP19K13220","I would like to thank the anonymous reviewer and the editor for a large number of thoughtful comments.

ELF interactions have been shown to be characterized by the speakers' mutual cooperation in the co-construction of meaning. Repetition, paraphrasing, as well as self- and other-repair and pre-emptive moves have emerged as important strategies, together with the exploitation of multilingual resources and repertoires. Communication strategies, rather than a mere compensation device, are thus to be considered an essential element in the process of effective communication, in that they are strategically used by speakers as part of ""communicative capability."" This paper explores communication strategies emerging from data in the Leisure subsection of the VOICE corpus. Through a qualitative Conversation Analysis approach, the analysis focuses particularly on interactional strategies employed to ensure mutual understanding and effective communication. Data have been first analysed through keywords signalling request for clarification and/or repetition, and then qualitatively focusing on how individual multilingual resources are naturally deployed and shared in the strategic co-construction of meaning and comprehension, particularly as to concepts and ideas that are lingua-culturally connoted. © 2019 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.","communication strategies; meaning co-construction; Multilingual Resource Pools; VOICE Leisure corpus",,,,,,,,,"Alptektin, C., Redefining multicompetence for bilingualism and ELF (2010) International Journal of Applied Linguistics, 20 (1), pp. 95-110; Aston, G., Notes on the interlanguage of comity (1993) Interlanguage Pragmatics, pp. 224-250. , Gabriele Kasper & Shoshana Blum-Kulka (eds.), Oxford & New York: Oxford University Press; Baker, W., (2015) Culture and Identity through English As a Lingua Franca: Rethinking Concepts and Goals in Intercultural Communication, , Berlin: Mouton de Gruyter; Batziakas, B., Investigating Meaning Making in English as a Lingua Franca Interactions in an International Students Society in London (2013) ELF5 - Proceedings of the Fifth International Conference of English As a Lingua Franca, pp. 344-351. , Yasemin Bayyurt & Sumru Akcan (eds.), May 24-26 2012, Istanbul, Istanbul: Bogazici University; Batziakas, B., Communicative practices in English as a lingua franca interactions: Some examples from Asian university students in London (2017) Asian Englishes, 19 (1), pp. 44-56; Berns, M., (1990) Contexts of Competence.

University of Cambridge","For each CELF member to recognise “the importance of teacher reflexivity and praxis” and thereby exert “professional initiative” fully ( Toh 2016 : 355, 364), the continuous effort to familiarise her/himself with ELF research and beyond is fundamental. For this reason, the CELF faculty development coordinators Brett Milliner (2015–2017) and subsequently Rasami Chaikul (2018 onwards) have organised monthly workshops for CELF faculty and staff, inviting scholars from both inside and outside the university. Research and teaching ideas, including those from these workshops, have been shared and discussed online via Blackboard, under the leadership of Travis Cote, and distributed through the CELF Journal volumes, for which Brett Milliner and Travis Cote have continuously served as editors. https:// www.tamagawa.ac.jp/celf/research/journal.html (last accessed September 1, 2019). Toh (2016) implies a need to stay aligned with research development in the field of ELF. Since the time of Toh’s (2016) writing, research at CELF has become more fully fledged. In the most recent year of 2019, before the completion of this article, CELF invited Fan Fang (Shantou University, China) and Koun Choi (University of Cambridge, UK), cosponsored by the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) Kakenhi Grant (no. 18H05585), JSPS Kakenhi Grants are national competitive funding schemes. as well as Ayako Suzuki (Tamagawa University, Japan) and Safnil Arsyad (University of Bengkulu, Indonesia), who visited at the invitation of the CELF Director Masaki Oda. These scholars respectively discussed university teaching and assessment, school action research, language policy, and international publication. Meanwhile, CELF was privileged by the visit of Henry Widdowson and Barbara Seidlhofer (University of Vienna, Austria), both of whom have contributed significantly to ELF as an increasingly prominent field in applied linguistics. Additionally, the 2019 CELF Forum for English Language Teaching is going to invite Will Baker (University of Southampton, UK), cosponsored by the same continuing grant (no. 19K20794), to discuss transculturality in ELT. Toh (2016) remarks that discussions at CELF were restricted to skills and competencies, “crowding out the accommodative, communicative, pragmatic and cultural attributes of ELF-informed pedagogy” ( Toh 2016 : 362). Although during the period from the establishment of CELF to the time of Toh’s (2016) article, there were workshops, presentations, and discussions about how English teaching could be different in response to ELF research findings, we can acknowledge the validity of his comment. However, CELF has been evolving. Along with frequent faculty development workshops and annual CELF Forums, three on-going JSPS Kakenhi projects offer evidence of transformation. First, as an extension of Sato et al. (2019) , the CELF research team consisting of Blagoja Dimoski, Rasami Chaikul, Satomi Kuroshima, Tricia Okada, and Yuri Jody Yujobo is investigating how fluency and comprehension in a multilingual setting with Japanese university students are co-constructed mainly through communication strategies (grant no. JP18K00753). Also, the first author is exploring a possible synergy between EMF awareness in L1 shared classrooms and communicative practices for multilingual reality (grant no. JP19K20794). At the level of programme administration, the CELF Director Masaki Oda is reframing post-native-speakerist English education within and against political, institutional, and social constraints (grant no. JP18K00792). Apart from the above projects, Yuri Jody Yujobo’s academic affairs committee and the authors’ curriculum development team will start sharing “module” materials with all CELF faculty in 2020. One section of a module takes around 30 minutes, and each instructor can use any part of the materials to be uploaded and continually refined in a shared cloud. Some initial modules are directly related to ELF theories, including An introduction to EMF (Tomokazu Ishikawa), Critical cultural reading for effective communication (Satomi Kuroshima), and Colour as a mode of communication (Andrew Leichsenring). These module titles are tentative at the stage of writing this article. Others facilitate linguistic and cultural awareness among students by using language for academic learning, such as media literacy (Paul McBride), cognitive psychology (Tomokazu Ishikawa), and the sociology of gender (Tricia Okada), as well as for yoga learning (Brett Milliner). The members involved do not see commercialised English textbooks as materials to be used uncritically or without thought as to how they might be modified, developed, supplemented, and extended in accordance with the needs and interests of local learners. To this effect, they believe that new module materials will be helpful additions for situated pedagogy. 5",,"Bachman, L.F., Palmer, A.S., (1996) Language Testing in Practice, , Oxford: Oxford University Press; Baird, R., Baker, W., Kitazawa, M., The complexity of ELF (2014) Journal of English As a Lingua Franca, 3 (1), pp. 171-196; Baker, W., The cultures of English as a lingua franca (2009) TESOL Quarterly, 43 (4), pp. 567-592; Baker, W., Intercultural awareness: Modelling an understanding of cultures in intercultural communication through English as a lingua franca (2011) Language and Intercultural Communication, 11 (3), pp. 197-214; Baker, W., (2015) Culture and Identity through English As a Lingua Franca: Rethinking Concepts and Goals in Intercultural Communication, , Berlin: Mouton de Gruyter; Baker, W., English as a lingua franca and intercultural communication (2018) The Routledge Handbook of English As a Lingua Franca, pp. 25-36. , Jennifer Jenkins, Will Baker & Martin Dewey (eds.), London: Routledge; Baker, W., Sangiamchit, C., Transcultural communication: Language, communication and culture through English as a lingua franca in a social network community (2019) Language and Intercultural Communication, , Latest Articles; (2019), https://www.tamagawa.jp/en/highereducation/efl.html, CELF [Center for English as a Lingua Franca] English as a lingua franca program at Tamagawa University.

The discussion is based on a qualitative analysis of interviews of Japanese business people who have been raised and educated in Japan and have used BELF for professional purposes. The interviews explore the linguistic challenges that they have faced in performing their work in English and how they have dealt with these challenges. The prime focus of the discussion in this paper is how BELF users transformed themselves from ""learners of English in the classroom"" into ""BELF users"" during the early stage of their professional career. With this focus, I develop a working model of BELF users' learning process by taking inspiration from the ""Experiential Learning Theory"" (Kolb 1984. Experiential learning: experience as the source of learning and development. New Jersey: Prentice Hall). Experiential Learning: Experience as The Source of Learning and Development. New Jersey: Prentice Hall), a widely used theoretical model of the learning process of adults, along with other theories in the field of management. The proposed model of BELF users places ""learning from experience"" of using English at the centre of the development of their English competence, supplemented by ""learning from others"" and ""learning from studying."" This article concludes with pedagogical implications for professional training and higher education and beyond, as well as theoretical contributions to the understanding of English as a lingua franca (ELF)/BELF. By drawing on the detailed stories of Japanese BELF users, I present a dynamic view of the competence of (B)ELF users by considering the significant changes of their competence over time and space throughout their careers rather than a snapshot of their competence at a particular time. © 2019 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.","BELF; business English; English as a lingua franca; experiential learning theory; global; Japan; learning at work; narrative; professional",,,,,,"19K13281","This work is supported by JSPS KAKEN grant number 19K13281.",,"Allen, D., Japanese cram schools and entrance exam washback (2016) The Asian Journal of Applied Linguistics, 3 (1), pp. 54-67; Allio, R.J., Leadership development: Teaching versus learning (2005) Management Decision, 43 (7-8), pp. 1071-1077; Armstrong, S.J., Fukami, C., (2009) The SAGE Handbook of Management Learning, Education and Development, , London: Sage; Bargiela-Chiappini, F., Nickerson, C., Planken, B., (2007) Business Discourse.

This study intends to add empirical evidence on Chinese business English teachers' perceptions and understanding of the practicality of ELF-informed teaching. Based on interviews with 12 business English teachers, this study presents one main conflict and three subsidiary conflicts regarding the implementation of ELF-informed teaching in the Business English Program. The main conflict is between teachers' general awareness of ELF and their expressed preference for native-English based teaching. The three subsidiary conflicts are between (i) ENL-based learning and ELF-informed teaching; (ii) English for tests and English for use; (iii) intervention and innovation. Following this, four barriers that impede the implementation of ELF-informed teaching are summarized. This study also discusses course-of-actions that could address the conflicts and barriers in implementing ELF-informed pedagogy in the Chinese context. © 2019 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.","attitudes and perceptions; ELF-informed teaching; English as a lingua franca; the Business English Program",,,,,,,,,"(2019) International Student Data Monthly Summary, , https://internationaleducation.gov.au/research/International-StudentData/Documents/MONTHLY%20SUMMARIES/2019/Jul%202019%20MontlyInfographic.pdf, Australian Education International.

This paper reports a qualitative study of the metalinguistic and evaluative practices of university students in Chile, Mexico and Spain. It explores how they ascribe (un)desirable meanings to different ways of speaking English as an additional language (i. e. indexical relations), whether these symbolic associations are seen to influence students' own linguistic use, and the extent to which such indexical relations are theorised as inherent in language form or as symbolic and negotiable (i. e. metasemiotic awareness). The analysis of more than 53 hours of elicited interview talk reveals a complex web of available social meaning relations and multidirectional accounts of the effects that such meanings have on students' linguistic and semiotic practices. Although many students display awareness of the contextual variability of social meaning-making processes (Coupland. 2007. Style: Language variation and identity. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press), only a minority were able to directly challenge dominant indexical associations and stereotypical trait attributions. The findings underscore the need for English language teachers to understand their students' semiotic goals and interpretative repertoires, firstly to avoid discriminating against sociolinguistically motivated variation in students' English use and secondly, to provide them with additional tools to negotiate their position as speakers of English as an additional language. The paper also reflects on the implications that these findings have for how we explain variation and attitudinal ambivalence in ELF research. © 2019 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.","indexicality; language perceptions; metasemiotic awareness; social meaning making; Spanish-speaking contexts; users of English as an additional language",,,,,,"Economic and Social Research Council, ESRC","My most sincere gratitude goes to colleagues who kindly offered feedback on earlier drafts of this article.

The native/non-native question resists a straightforward answer, but taking account of the views of people in the business world is a necessary step towards understanding the underlying issues. This article investigates the nature and origin of these views by analysing online newspaper comments written in response to a column in the Financial Times. It first identifies several topics related to the native/non-native question, including perceived differences between and within the two categories. It then discusses these topics from a language-ideological perspective, aiming to identify the patterns of beliefs and assumptions that inform the comments. Although this perspective involves a critical evaluation of the binary ""native/non-native"" opposition, the article identifies several important effects of the native speaker concept, ranging from outright discrimination to feelings of frustration and inhibition. It portrays the comments as both reflecting and questioning the ideological premises of the native speaker concept, and it considers the implications of the approach for ELF research and for the wider study of international communication. © 2019 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.","business communication; language ideologies; media discourse; native and non-native speakers",,,,,,,,,"Asif, A., Voice, footing, enregisterment (2005) Journal of Linguistic Anthropology, 15 (1), pp. 38-59; Jannis, A., (2010) Ideologizing Ethnolectal German, pp. 182-202. , Sally Johnson & Tommaso Milani (eds.), Language ideologies and media discourse: Texts, practices, politics.

For the purposes of the present experiment, 18 native speakers of Croatian were recorded narrating two short films in their mother tongue as well as in English. Each of the 135 participants, whose L1 is Slovene, listened to a recorded Croatian speaker retelling one story in their native language and another in English. The intelligibility of the two communicative modes was measured using multiple-choice questions. Overall, the level of comprehension was found to be higher for English than for Croatian. Two extralinguistic factors (border proximity and language preference) were also considered so as to gain a deeper insight into the nature of the intelligibility of English as a lingua franca (ELF) and receptive multilingualism as two potential mediums of communication between Croatian and Slovene speakers. © 2019 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston 2019.","closely related language; communication; ELF; intelligibility; receptive multilingualism",,,,,,"Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek, NWO

Thus, implementing various CSs is said to be important for learners in ELF interactions. Although a list of CSs might indicate which strategies English learners may ultimately need, it is not necessarily helpful for low-proficiency English learners as they may not be able to use many CSs due to a lack of English language resources. This study attempts to identify CSs that 20 Japanese low-proficiency English users employ in talk-in-interaction with English language instructors. CSs investigated in this study were not restricted to those examined from second language acquisition perspectives but included pragmatic and collaborative strategies identified in various ELF studies. Investigating CSs from the perspective of ELF helps to form a more sensitive analysis of how low-proficiency English users work to achieve successful L2 communication with interlocutors. Results revealed that the students, who were not given prior instruction in strategies, collaboratively employed various CSs to cope with communication breakdown, promote message conveyance, and co-construct a meaningful interaction with their interlocutors. These findings provide insights into how low-proficiency users might manage to achieve successful communication in various ELF settings. Analysis of the data helps to inform teachers which CSs low-proficiency learners may utilize more easily and those for which they may require more intensive practice. © 2019 Sato et al, published by De Gruyter 2019.","collaborative interaction; communication strategies; English as a lingua franca; low-proficiency English users; project-based learning",,,,,,,,,"Maxwell, A.J., Heritage, J., (1984) Transcript Notation, , J.

Through membership categorization analysis (Schegloff, Emanuel A. 2007. A tutorial on membership categorization. Journal of Pragmatics 39(3). 462-482), this study shows that perceived proficiency in English, along with migration status and reliance on the native English speaker norm, seemed to be the most decisive elements in how the nurses categorized their migrant clients. The findings demonstrate the power of categorization as an instrument in institutional decision-making and highlight the role language plays in these categorizations. In particular, the study shows how influential perceived English language proficiency and the native speaker norm are in how nurses categorize their migrant clients. The findings suggest that being able to interact with clients in English is becoming a more and more important skill in working life in Finland, also in the health care sector. It would be important to understand how influential perceived language proficiency is in the way nurses conceptualize their clients, and to what extent this relates to the standard language ideology (Milroy, James. 2001.

The engineers took part in an intensive English course provided by their company before being transferred to overseas offices. Conducting individual/focus-group interviews multiple times during and after the English course, the study sheds light on the participants' ambivalent and shifting perception of the language, which has both communicative and identifying function in different contexts of use. While these BELF (English as a business lingua franca) users were more content-focused and critical about a teacher's form-focused approach during the intensive English language training, they are likely to identify more with native-speakers' English rather than with their own English communication in BELF environments. The paper discusses that there are two reasons for their adherence to ""standard"" English, referring to the impact of ""standard"" English ideology (Cogo 2015, 2016b; Seidlhofer 2011, 2018) and social power (French and Raven 1959) that their interlocutors possess. First, the participants are constrained by their past learning experience as EFL (English as a foreign language) learners (Iino and Murata 2016) with little exposure to varieties of English other than the Inner Circle English models (Kachru 1992). Second, they believe in the advantage of using ""correct"" or ""proper"" English in producing a good image of their company or themselves. More specifically, while the participants regard English predominantly as a tool to fulfil their communicative goals when working with interlocutors who have relatively less power (e.g. subordinates, subcontractors), they feel that they need to speak ""proper"" English when communicating with people with more power and authority (e.g. superiors, clients), because they believe it is more relevant and accepted by the wider public. In other words, the result shows how the ""standard"" English ideology is deep-seated in the workplace communication discourse. © 2019 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston 2019.","attitudes; English as a business lingua franca (BELF); English as a lingua franca (ELF); Japanese business people; language ideology; power relationship",,,,,,,,,"Robert, B., Baker, W., Kitazawa, M., The complexity of ELF (2014) Journal of English As A Lingua Franca, 3 (1), pp. 171-196; Beyza, B., PhD supervision meetings in an English as a Lingua Franca (ELF) setting: Linguistic competence and content knowledge as neutralizers of institutional and academic power (2017) Journal of English As A Lingua Franca, 6 (1), pp. 111-139; Mirjaliisa, C., Language Matters in Global Communication: Article Based on ORA Lecture, October 2006 (2007) Journal of Business Communication, 44 (3), pp. 260-282; Mirjaliisa, C., Marschan-Piekkari, R., Language training for enhanced horizontal communication: A challenge for MNCs (2002) Business Communication Quarterly, 65 (2), pp. 9-29; Alessia, C., Accommodating difference in ELF conversations (2009) English As A Lingua Franca: Studies and Findings, pp. 254-273. , Anna Mauranen & Elina Ranta (eds.) .

""Intersubjectivity"" (Rommetveit, Ragnar. 1976. On the architecture of intersubjectivity. In Ragnar Rommetveit & Rolv Mikkel Blakar [eds.], Studies of language, thought, and verbal communication, 93-107. New York: Academic Press) refers to the shared perspective of the social world by the interlocutors. In ELF interactions where shared perspectives cannot be presumed, efforts to achieve intersubjectivity are critical. ELF research has explicated speakers' efforts and cooperativeness to achieve intersubjectivity or avoid misunderstandings during interactions (Kaur, Jagdish. 2011a. ""Doing being a language expert"": The case of the ELF speaker. In Alasdair Archibald, Alessia Cogo & Jennifer Jenkins [eds.], Latest Trends in ELF Research, 53-75. Newcastle upon Tyne: Cambridge Scholars Publishing; Seidlhofer, Barbara. 2001. Closing a conceptual gap: The case for a description of English as a lingua franca. International Journal of Applied Linguistics 11[2]. 133-158). However, few studies have investigated cases where speakers display mutual understanding during a repair sequence even when the understanding is not accurate. Approximately 37 hours of naturally occurring ELF interactions were collected and analyzed using a standard conversation analysis followed by a post-analytic researcher observation. Detailed analyses of repair sequences regarding a word suggest that in non-institutional ELF interactions the accuracy of intersubjectivity is not always prioritized. Rather, statements made by the speaker positioned as the one with relatively stronger linguistic ability seem to hold influence over the repair sequence, which prompts the interlocutor with relatively weaker ability to agree with inaccurate candidate understandings. The study suggests a connection between the positioning of speakers regarding linguistic knowledge and the construction of intersubjectivity in ELF interactions. © 2018 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston 2018.","English as a lingua franca; Intersubjectivity; Repair sequence",,,,,,,,,"Archibald, A., Cogo, A., Jenkins, J., (2011) Latest Trends in ELF Research, , Newcastle upon Tyne: Cambridge Scholars Publishing.

This paper examines formulaic sequences signalling discourse organisation in academic ELF lectures from a disciplinary perspective. Most previous studies of this kind employ a frequency-based approach; however, the inherent limitations of the methodology (e.g. arbitrary operational criteria, difficulty in handling discontinuous units) mean that a great deal may have been overlooked. This may be particularly relevant to ELF communication, which involves a high degree of flexibility and adaptability. The present study aims to address this gap by taking a manual approach in the identification of formulaic sequences, continuous or discontinuous, in context. The results provide further evidence for disciplinary differences and variability in the use of formulaic language to signal discourse organisation by lecturers in academic ELF settings. © 2018 Walter de Gruyter GmbH.

The teamwork project - assigned by the content teacher - took place mostly outside the classroom and simulated business practice both in terms of the tasks and themulticultural context. Each team comprised two Austrian students and two international students, resulting in an English as a lingua franca (ELF) setting. The teams were observed and audio-/video-recorded, with the analysis focusing on an early stage of the project where they laid the groundwork for the team mental models in terms of establishing the team goals, relationships and communicative practices. Additionally, retrospective interviews were conducted at the end of the project with each of the team members and the lecturer to gain emic insights into the project. The findings suggest a symbiotic relationship between disagreement and trust, in which high levels of trust and the construction of a psychologically safe space allow the team members to disagree with and challenge each other without damaging their relationships, leading to better decisions. In turn, these decisions can contribute to a sense of shared success that strengthens the team's joint identity. © 2018 Walter de Gruyter GmbH.

The data include the PhD defences in their entirety, including monologic and dialogic talk by participants from a variety of research cultures. The defences were video-recorded and transcribed, and laughter episodes analysed according to who laughed, who the source of ""the laughable"" was, what the reason for laughing was and at what point laughter occurred. The analysis reveals that a majority of laughter was non-humorous, produced by one person, and had the function of mitigating face threats to speakers and others. Humorous laughter was usually produced by more than one person and had the function of relieving tension, creating a non-adversarial atmosphere and building a community. These results are connected to the communicative purposes of the participants; the participants' mutual aim is to examine an academic work and confirm the candidate's membership in their chosen specialisation, which requires cooperation from all parties. Furthermore, although the participants come from different research cultures where humour can have a different presence and function, this study shows that laughter and humour are frequent and fill an important function in ELF interactions in high-stakes academic situations. © 2018 Walter de Gruyter GmbH.

In these meetings, all supervisors and students use English as their lingua franca (ELF). Such supervision meetings are made up of ""social negotiation"" and ""collaborative sense-making,"" providing a good base for learning to take place (Vygotsky, L. S. 1978. Mind in society: The development of higher psychological processes. Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press), which in the present context is the ""enculturation"" of the PhD student into the research community (Manathunga, Catherine. 2014.

It is precisely these negotiation and collaborative sense-making practices that the present paper focuses on, in order to investigate knowledge construction practices. While there is an abundance of research in disciplinary knowledge construction and academic literacy practices from cognitive and behavioral sciences, knowledge about novice scholars' knowledge construction practices is scant in applied linguistics (but see Li, Yongyan. 2006. Negotiating knowledge contribution to multiple discourse communities: A doctoral student of computer science writing for publication. Journal of Second Language Writing 15[3]. 159-178). Even less is known about how PhD students may negotiate knowledge construction and engage in meaning-making practices in interaction with their supervisors. The material comprises 11 hours of naturally occurring speech by three supervisors and their students where they discuss the reviewers' comments they have received fromthe journal. The predominantmethod employed here is applied conversation analysis (CA) (Richards, Keith & Paul Seedhouse [eds.]. 2005. Applying conversation analysis. Basingstoke: Palgrave Macmillan), which includes both local patterns of interaction as well as ""the tensions between [these] local practices and any 'larger structures' in which these are embedded, such as conventional membership categories, institutional rules, instructions, accounting obligations, etc."" (Have, Paul ten. 2007. Doing conversation analysis. London: Sage 199). The analyses here aim to show how the PhD supervisors and students discuss the reviewers' comments with reference to (i) their own disciplinary community of climate science, and (ii) the domestic discourse community of the target journals (see also Li, Yongyan. 2006. Negotiating knowledge contribution to multiple discourse communities: A doctoral student of computer science writing for publication. Journal of Second Language Writing 15[3]. 159-178). The preliminary findings of the analyses show a tendency by the PhD students to focus more heavily on the domestic discourse community of the target journals, especially when justifying their methodological choices. The PhD supervisors, on the other hand, base their meaning-making on the conventions of the disciplinary community of climate science, pointing out broader disciplinary community practices. These findings, highlighting a need to focus on novice scholars' meaningmaking efforts, can be used to inform PhD supervision in general. © 2018 Walter de Gruyter GmbH.

There is little known, however, about how disagreement is realised in ELF academic group discussion tasks, where the tendency towards greater cooperation and mutual support in ELF communication may be at odds with the need to achieve task goals through the expression of an oppositional stance. In addressing this issue, the current study sought to answer the research question: how do postgraduate students in a UK university setting express their disagreement in ELF academic group discussion? Twelve participants from ten different linguacultural backgrounds completed two different simulated discussion tasks: one targeting opinions, and the other consensus decision-making. The same participants also took part in retrospective stimulated-recall interviews using the video-recording of their discussions as a stimulus. Discourse analysis of the transcribed interactions revealed that the ELF participants used a wide range of verbal, nonverbal and interactional strategies in their disagreeing practices. Three salient strategies are presented in detail: focus shifts, complex turn-management (other-initiated disagreement turn dependence and turn-throwing/passing), and the use of gaze. Through these examples, we show that while the discourse produced in group discussion tasks was rich in disagreement, ELF participants used complex linguistic and interactional strategies to avoid explicit displays of their oppositional stance. Results are discussed with a view to developing theory around disagreement in ELF academic contexts. © 2018 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston 2018.","Academic group discussion; Disagreeing practices;

It particularly focuses on the sequences when students and their instructors deal with miscommunication in multilingual writing classrooms at a US university. Adapting perspectives from the multimodal turn, I conceive of laughter as part of the diverse multimodal interactional resources that speakers in ELF contexts can coordinate with speech and other nonverbal, embodied actions (e.g. smile and body orientation), but that are distinct resources from speech. Combining sequential, multimodal analysis with ethnographic information, the data analysis reveals that laughter can have various functions in ELF classroom interactions at miscommunication moments. Laughter often subtly signals nonunderstanding, which can then lead to interactional repair. Other possible functions of laughter include pre-empting miscommunication by marking a speaker's problem related to vocabulary; teasing specific interlocutor( s); and building solidarity through shared laughter. Based on the analysis in this article, it can be argued that laughter may in fact be counterproductive in resolving misunderstanding in ELF classroom interactions due to its ambiguous, implicit nature. Findings suggest that ELF researchers benefit from developing a multimodal orientation by integrating nonverbal interactional resources into their discourse analyses in order to examine interlocutors' complex communicative strategies in a way that meaningfully coordinates various semiotic modes such as laughter and smile. Such an approach would provide a more robust conceptualization of communicative competence or practice of interlocutors in ELF contexts. © 2018 Walter de Gruyter GmbH.

We use data from CASE, a corpus of ELF Skype conversations in an informal setting between students from nine European countries. CS in our data is commonly used as a communication strategy. A quantitative analysis shows that it occurs in the majority of conversations and across all nationalities. Participants mostly switch to their own L1, frequently also to their interlocutors' L1, rarely to other languages. CS co-occurs with other discourse features, in particular other instances of CS and laughter. Based on a qualitative analysis, we distinguish three motivations and functions of CS: On an interpersonal level, CS can underline group membership or cultural identity and create rapport, often in combination with laughter. CS is used to improve communication at the discourse level by conveying concepts that are untranslatable and possibly unknown to the interlocutor, in metalinguistic commentary, or to close lexical gaps. CS can also be used for addressee specification. Through its combined qualitative and quantitative approach, the article aims at contributing to the analysis of the context as well as the motivations and functions of CS in ELF. © 2018 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston 2018.","code-switching; computer-mediated discourse; conversation strategies; ELF Skype conversations; functions of code-switching",,,,,,,,,"Adolphs, S., Carter, R., (2013) Spoken Corpus Linguistics: From Monomodal to Multimodal, , [Routledge Advances in Corpus Linguistics 15].

This paper uses a combination of a literature review of military-related language policy documents and semi-structured interviews to explore the impact of those policies on the use of English as the working language of a professional context, the Spanish military. Broadly, the findings show that the standardization of linguistic certification procedures, a requirement for their participation in international operations, places these professionals in a disadvantage scenario in which lack of linguistic proficiency translates into the questioning of their personal, professional and institutional validity. The analysis of Spanish soldiers' perceptions and attitudes helped to shed light on the conflicting interaction of language policies, practices and beliefs. Although English is valued as the language of work and therefore as a vehicle for interaction with other armies, for socialization or for contact with the local population, it is nonetheless viewed as an imposition of the globalized world, accepted with pragmatic and instrumental criteria, which entails the requirement of language certification standards they struggle to meet. © 2018 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston 2018.","English as a lingua franca; language beliefs; language planning; languages practices; linguistic certification policies",,,,,,,,,"Abbe, A., (2008) Building Cultural Capability for Full-spectrum Operations, , Arlington: United States Army Research Institute for the Behavioral and Social Sciences; Alderson, C., Air safety, language assessment policy, and policy implementation: The case of aviation English (2009) Annual Review of Applied Linguistics, 29, pp. 168-187; Alderson, C., Wall, D., Does washback exist?

Instead, the concept Community of Practice (CoP) has gained widespread currency in ELF research. While applications of the CoP framework have given rise to valuable insights, even ELF scholars who work with the concept often acknowledge its limitations. Since factors like situationality and ad hoc negotiation are seen as particularly important in ELF interactions, many ELF researchers have recently emphasized the transient and dynamic nature of the social clusters in which ELF communication typically takes place, especially in light of the multilingualism and language contact. This paper offers a first sketch of how the social dimension of ELF might on many occasions be conceptualized as involving Transient International Groups (TIGs) rather than more stable CoPs. Building on the idea that the Individual Multilingual Repertoires (IMRs) of ELF speakers make up a Multilingual Resource Pool (MRP) in each ELF interaction, the paper argues that ELF theory-building and descriptive work would benefit from exploring the group and the development dimension of ELF more thoroughly than has been done so far. In support, the paper provides a qualitative case study of a TIG in the leisure domain of VOICE.

Starting from discrepancies in my ELF identity as a speaker of English with ELT roots in a German secondary school, I argue for the social constructivist concept of MY English as a basis for understanding ELF competence development and the tensions surrounding the relationship between ELT and ELF. Continually shaped by speakers' participation in ELF communication, relevant dimensions of their MY English profiles include linguistic-communicative-communal repertoires and requirements of performance, individual and social identity orientations, and confidence in their ELF creativity. Against this backdrop, I discuss topics I consider relevant for a much-needed pedagogical reconciliation of ELT with ELF. Special attention is given to teachers' ELF apprehension and the distinction between a ""strict"" (quasi-behaviouristic) and an ""open"" (social constructivist) target language orientation, speaker satisfaction as a criterion of success in ELF communication, and teaching towards ELF competence from awareness raising to comprehension, production and interaction to non-native speaker emancipation. Successful ELF implementation in both ELT practice and ELT teacher education requires extensive and authentic involvement of students and teachers in ELF communication. Intercultural telecollaboration provides innovative means for creating a space for ELF communication in the ELT classroom. Pedagogical case studies about video and text chat conversations strongly support the assumption that using their common target language as a lingua franca significantly enables learners of English to develop an emancipated non-native speaker identity and thus to become speakers of English in their own right. And what is more, the pedagogical lingua franca approach can be successfully transferred to other foreign target languages as well. I conclude my article with a brief contextualization of the MY English concept in relation to translingual practice and ELF languaging. © 2018 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston 2018.","ELF competence; English as a lingua franca; English language teaching; intercultural telecollaboration; MY English; non-native speaker emancipation; speaker satisfaction",,,,,,,,,"Albl-Mikasa, M., Who's afraid of ELF: ""Failed"" natives or non-native speakers struggling to express themselves?

Towards a dynamic conceptual framework for English-medium education in multilingual university settings. Applied Linguistics 37[3]: 397-415) subsume under English-medium education in the international university. This contribution, however, looks at ELFFRA, English as a lingua franca in academic settings at the bi- and multilingual University of Fribourg, Switzerland. When English first became officially acknowledged as an additional academic language in 2005, being preceded by a period of ""unruly"" emergence, it was often the marked case, even in and for its local disciplinary speech events. Its current use at UFR as the default in some English-medium study programmes is by no means uniform or monolingual either. Meanwhile in the promotion of bilingualism in French and German, English is mostly ""included"" - reminiscent of the semiotics of the 2005 nonce coinage of ""bi(tri)lingualism."" This contribution will revisit ideas about the ""edulect"" role of ELFFRA (Schaller-Schwaner, Iris. 2017.

Very little research has investigated the role of English as a lingua franca (ELF) in other language learning environments, such as those in which Japanese is learnt as a second language (JSL) in Japan. This paper investigates the purposes for which ELF is employed, and the perspectives of learners from multilingual and multicultural backgrounds on the use of ELF, in the JSL classroom. The findings show that English is employed to varying degrees in relation to proficiency level, and that learners themselves are generally welcoming of this use. The author suggests that learners seek security and comfort in what they already know, with ELF easing the gap between their L1 and their developing Japanese skills. © 2018 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston 2018.","English as a lingua franca; English in JSL; Japanese as a second language; multilingualism in JSL; translanguaging",,,,,,,,,"Anh, K.H.K., Use of Vietnamese in English language teaching in Vietnam: Attitudes of Vietnamese university teachers (2010) English Language Teaching, 3 (2), pp. 119-128; Antón, M., Dicamilla, F.J., Socio-cognitive functions of L1 collaborative interaction in the L2 classroom (1999) The Modern Language Journal, 83 (2), pp. 233-247; Atkinson, D., The mother tongue in the classroom: A neglected resource?

World Englishes 22(4). 483-496; McKenzie 2010, The social psychology of English as a global language: Attitudes, awareness and identity in the Japanese context. Dordrecht: Springer). The current research targets Japanese university students and adds several insights into the nature of these attitudes through the analysis of 95 open-ended questionnaires and 18 conversational interviews. First of all, the participants' negative language attitudes embraced notable contradictions. Also, their ambivalence was scarcely evident, and more to the point, a matter of degree. Moreover, it is the doxic experience (Bourdieu 1977, Outline of a theory of practice. Trans. Richard Nice. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press) within Japanese society that was likely to hinder grounding those attitudes on their own critical thinking and valuing their English communication ability with non-Japanese. And most importantly, it was easy for them to appreciate English as a Lingua Franca (ELF) perspectives, so long as they would like to use English for international communication. More precisely, while they were unlikely to have any previous attitudes towards the unfamiliar representation of their English (i.e. from ELF perspectives), they were highly likely to develop positive attitudes towards it. This article calls for more future research and effort devoted to raising ELF awareness in Japanese and other similar contexts. © 2017 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.","Ambivalence; ELF awareness; English as a Lingua Franca (ELF); English in Japan; Japanese English education; language attitudes",,,,,,,,,"Baird, R., Baker, W., Kitazawa, M., The complexity of ELF (2014) Journal of English Asa Lingua Franca, 3 (1), pp. 171-196; Baker, W., (2015) Culture and Identity Through English As a Lingua Franca: Rethinking Conceptsand Goals in Intercultural Communication, , Berlin: De Gruyter Mouton; Banaji, M.R., Heiphetz, L., Attitudes (2010) Handbook of Social Psychology, 5th Edn, pp. 353-393. , In Susan T.

It presents a single case analysis of face negotiation devices utilized in two cases of third-party complaint sequences, in which complaints are made about someone else who is not present. The two cases to be analyzed were extracted from recordings of conversation of international students in British universities. The analysis revealed that the interactants utilize verbal and nonverbal devices, which are sometimes linguistically inexplicit but nonverbally resourceful, in a pragmatically sensitive manner in situ, thereby saving mutual face, intensifying the degree of face-threatening, or expressing disaffiliation in a face-saving way. © 2017 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.","Adversarial; Conversation analysis; ELF interactions; Face negotiation; Face-threatening acts; Politeness theory; Third-party complaints",,,,,,"Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, JSPS: 24720273","Funding: This study was partially supported by Japan Society for the Promotion of Science KAKENHI Grant Number 24720273.

Some of this resistance may result from a misunderstanding of key concepts and arguments, some from practical concerns and context-specific factors such as syllabus and assessment frameworks. A significant difficulty in persuading ELT practitioners to adopt or recognise ELF positions is the apparent conflict between preferences for standard language models and the reality of variable lingua franca goals for learning and use. ELF potentially changes everything, yet is a phenomenon grounded in unchanging social fundamentals of language use. This article reports on part of a continuing study into the impact of ELF perspectives on experienced language teachers, with a focus on their attitudes and levels of awareness in relation to their professional development and contexts. How teachers are enabled and encouraged to overcome potential scepticism, and reconcile the perceived conflict between standard models and lingua franca goals in their practice, is crucial to the spread of a more appropriate, ""ELF-aware"" form of language teacher education. Responses are mixed, but generally insightful and engaged, even when expressing reservations or doubt. There is also some good news, with clear evidence that attitudes can be influenced, through exposure to ideas, reflection and motivation towards action. © 2017 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.","ELF; ELT/TESOL; Language pedagogy; Standard language models; Teacher education",,,,,,"Endangered Language Fund","Keywords: ELF, teacher education, ELT/TESOL, language pedagogy, standard language models Resumen: La prevalencia de actitudes escépticas hacia la relevancia de la investigación en el ámbito de inglés como lengua franca para la pedagogía del inglés y la educación del profesorado ha sido bien documentada. Parte de este rechazo puede ser el resultado de malentendidos entorno a conceptos claves y argumentos, y por otra parte puede ser fruto de consideraciones prácticas y específicas de cada contexto relacionadas con los programas didácticos y mar-cos de evaluación. Un impedimento significativo a la hora de convencer a los docentes que deben adoptar o reconocer las posturas planteadas por ILF es el aparente conflicto entre la preferencia por modelos estándares de lengua y la realidad de los objetivos variables de la lengua franca en cuanto al uso y el aprendizaje del idioma. ILF puede desestabilizar todo el terreno, pero es un fenómeno arraigado en los fundamentos sociales del uso del lenguaje. Este artículo presenta parte de una investigación en desarrollo sobre el efecto de las perspectivas de ILF sobre el un profesorado de inglés experto, enfocando en particular sus actitudes y conocimientos en relación a sus propios ámbitos y desarrollo profesionales. Es imprescindible entender cómo se logra superar el posible escepticismo y reconciliar el conflicto percibido entre los modelos nor-malizados y los objetivos prácticos de la lengua franca para el profesorado, para así fomentar un desarrollo profesional más apropiado y sensibilizado al ILF. Las respuestas han sido variadas pero siempre lúcidas y comprometidas, aun cuando se expresan reservas o dudas.

In this paper I describe an experiment in ""co-certification,"" a test of English set at level C1 of the Common European Framework of Reference (CEFR), jointly developed by Trinity College London and the University of Ca' Foscari Venice, in which an international version of the test was adapted locally to include locally relevant components and enhance validity and task authenticity. One feature of the co-certification was the introduction of an independent listening task which took the form of understanding an extract from a lecture given in English by a non-native speaker. Possible problems we had anticipated ranged from the kind of discourse features they should include, and whether or not there was a fairness issue related to accent recognition. In fact, the overall results showed no significant difference from the previous version of the exam, while the listening part had a higher pass rate than the overall oral test which involved interaction with a native speaker. As far as we know, the co-certification is the first example of an internationally recognized board engaging systematically with characteristic features of ELF communication, notably non-native phonology and intonation patterns, in a test of listening. The findings so far suggest that, for the test takers at least, this can be unproblematic and uncontroversial. © 2017 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.","certificazioni; enti certificatori; l'ascolto;

Adaptations were observed in the language practices, including well-attested strategies and non-selections, but also distinct and hybridised patterns (e.g. question-response exchanges, address-reference forms). Although these features can be explained in terms of the improvisational stances of the users, in light of the wide disparities in proficiency, strategies, degrees of success, and of the hybrid forms that came to be locally preferred, a more satisfactory explanatory framework was sought in the broader study of historical language contact and change, especially in Mufwene's recent re-interpretation of creoles as situated cases of language restructuring. The observed ELF practices are explained as the result of cooperative restructuring, by means of fitness-based selections from the feature pool, or virtual capacity, fed by the diverse repertoires of the participants. Such an approach foregrounds functional interpretations of ELF, and creates an inclusive framework wherein the variables that define different contact situations can be discerned. © 2017 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.","Creoleslanguage contact; Diversity; Repertoires; Selection; Virtual",,,,,,,,,"Arends, J., The socio-historical background of creoles (1994) Pidgins and Creoles: An Introduction, pp. 15-24. , Jacques Arends, PieterMuysken & Norval Smith (eds.)

Drawing on a case study of immigrant Filipino adolescents in Vancouver, this paper examines how class differences of these youth impinge on their lived experiences and the material conditions of their migration, shaping how they negotiate their linguistic capital, particularly their use of English. Data illustrate how such conditions shape their dispositions, their sense of agency, and feelings of linguistic confidence and insecurity. Using Darvin and Norton's (2015. Identity and a model of investment in applied linguistics. Annual Review of Applied Linguistics 35. 36-56) model of investment as a lens to investigate the interplay of identity, capital, and ideology in communicative contexts, this paper asserts how contrasting language attitudes are constructed by asymmetrical relations of power between speakers. In the spirit of accommodation and adaptation that characterizes ELF communication, this paper calls for a critical pedagogy that enables speakers to reflect on how they position themselves and others in these contexts, and assert their place as legitimate speakers of English. © 2017 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.","Critical pedagogy; Investment; Language attitude; Linguistic capital; Social class",,,,,,"International Research Foundation for English Language Education","Acknowledgments: The author would like to acknowledge the generous support of the Vanier Canada Graduate Scholarships and The International Research Foundation for English Language Education, and thank Barbara Seidlhofer, Bonny Norton, and two anonymous reviewers for providing feedback on an earlier draft of this article.",,"Baird, R., Baker, W., Kitazawa, M., The complexity of ELF (2014) Journal of English As a LinguaFranca, 3 (1), pp. 171-196; Baker, W., Culture and complexity through English as a lingua franca: Rethinkingcompetences and pedagogy in ELT (2015) Journal of English As a Lingua Franca, 4 (1), pp. 9-30; Bhatt, R.M., World Englishes, globalization and the politics of conformity (2010) Contending with Globalization in World Englishes, pp. 93-112. , In M.

While goal orientation constitutes a hallmark of ELF scholarship, the latter notion has received limited scholarly attention. To address this gap, this study examines a dyadic, institutional interaction between two students in the United States (L1 British English and L1 Arabic) who met for an intercultural conversation assigned by their instructors. In the interest of accomplishing the goal of obtaining intercultural information, the participants did not bring their differences in linguistic identity to the fore of the interaction, while it was also found that the pursuit of an institutional goal can at times manifest itself as orientations to linguistic norms. The examination of these overt orientations to the institutional goal is followed by a study of deviant cases in which the L1 speaking participant appeared to make relevant his superior linguistic identity at first glance. While they could be interpreted as claims of linguistic superiority, a closer look revealed that these instances also reflected the participants' cooperative orientations to the emergent communicative needs so as to jointly accomplish the shared goal. Highlighting the problem of presuming a correlation between interactional behavior and linguistic identity, the study suggests the need for the analyst to withhold his/her preconceptions about interactants' identities. Further research involving diverse groups of interactants, including L1 speakers of English, is needed to contribute to the recent theoretical developments that characterize ELF interaction as situated within diverse linguacultural ecologies and power dynamics. © 2017 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.","Conversation analysis; ELF; Goal orientation; Institutional talk; Linguistic identity; Multilingualism",,,,,,,,,"Atkinson, J.M., Drew, P., (1979) Order in Court: The Organization of Verbal Interactionin Judicial Settings, , London, UK: Macmillan; Björkman, B., An analysis of polyadic English as a lingua franca (ELF) speech:A communicative strategies framework (2014) Journal of Pragmatics, 66, pp. 122-138; Canagarajah, S., (2013) Translingual Practice: Global Englishes and Cosmopolitan Relations, , NY: Routledge; Cicourel, A., (1973) Cognitive Sociology: Language and Meaning in Social Interaction, , Harmondsworth: Penguin Education; Cogo, A., Accomodating difference in ELF conversations: A study of pragmaticstrategies (2009) English As a Lingua Franca: Studies Andfindings, pp. 254-273. , In A.

Such dynamic and context-related nature of ELF involves collaboration and accommodative behaviour of all interlocutors. As the main focus of research on ELF has been interaction predominantly among non-native speakers of English, the present study investigates how native English speakers behave in ELF interaction, that is, whether/how they accommodate their English and what their stance is towards linguistic accommodation. Responses were collected by means of an online questionnaire, yielding 377 respondents in total, who report making adjustments when communicating with non-native speakers, most frequently by enunciating clearly, using fewer idioms and speaking more slowly. The main reasons native speakers give for adjusting their language are promoting mutual intelligibility, showing courtesy and helping the interlocutor hone their English language skills. A fifth of the respondents, however, worry that accommodation might prevent the improvement of non-native speakers' English proficiency, be perceived as being patronising, and reduce the quality of conversation. © 2017 Walter de Gruyter GmbH.","ELF; language attitudes; linguistic accommodation; native English speakers; non-native English speakers",,,,,,,,,"Molly, B., Evidence for phonetic and social selectivity in spontaneous phonetic imitation (2012) Journal of Phonetics, 40, pp. 177-189; Will, B., From cultural awareness to intercultural awareness: Culture in ELT (2012) ELT Journal, 66 (1), pp. 62-70; Heather, B., Brennan, S.E., Use and acquisition of idiomatic expressions in referring by native and non-native speakers (1997) Discourse Processes, 23 (2), pp. 119-147; Suresh, C., Lingua franca English, multilingual communities, and language acquisition (2007) The Modern Language Journal, 91 (1), pp. 923-939; Michael George, C., ""second generation"" foreigner talk in Australia (1981) International Journal of the Sociology of Language, 28, pp. 69-80; Alessia, C., Accommodating difference in ELF conversations: A study of pragmatic strategies (2009) English As A Lingua Franca: Studies and Findings, pp. 254-273. , Anna Mauranen & Elina Ranta (eds.)

The ELF users were video-recorded engaging in researcher-designed tasks which required sharing information to achieve a joint goal. Subsequent stimulated recall with individual speakers targeted instances of potential or actual difficulties in understanding. Recordings and transcripts of the paired tasks and stimulated recall were used to identify communication strategies used to address difficulties in understanding. Results showed that overall, 11 different strategy types were seen across both pairs of speakers. However, the pair which achieved the shared goal showed a different pattern of strategy use and of interaction than the pair which did not achieve the shared goal. The two pairs also differed in how they attributed responsibility for successful communication. These findings, discussed in the context of previous ELF communication strategy research, highlight benefits of investigating interlocutors' contemporaneous thoughts and feelings and the ways in which communication strategies are used during interactions. © 2017 Walter de Gruyter GmbH.","communication strategies; contextual factors; English as a lingua franca; intelligibility",,,,,,"Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada, SSHRC

This paper argues that effective communication is vital for developing ""virtuous,"" rather than vicious, circles and that research into (B)ELF offers an insight into what effective communication in multicultural and multilingual teams can look like. The conceptual frame develops research into ELF and BELF by also drawing on organisational and management research to examine team processes and the role of language within them. The second part of the paper presents illustrative examples from data collected in an ethnographic study from an English-medium marketing master's programme at WU Vienna. The students' teamwork project comprises an international market entry simulation and can be seen as a training ground for managing both business content and team processes. The findings indicate that both the ELF context and the ELF talk furthered the development of rapport, and that the students' ""casual talk"" supported their ""work talk."" The paper finishes with a call for more empirical research into language use among recent business graduates and how to prepare students better for a globalised workplace. © 2017 Walter de Gruyter GmbH.","BELF; ELF; language in IB; multicultural teamwork; rapport",,,,,,,,,"Annelie, A., Rapport building in student group work (2011) Journal of Pragmatics, 43 (12), pp. 2932-2947; Jo, A., Managing disagreement in problem solving meeting talk (2012) Journal of Pragmatics, 44 (12), pp. 1565-1579; Jo, A., Locher, M.A., Theorising disagreement (2012) Journal of Pragmatics, 44 (12), pp. 1549-1553; Vasileios, B., (2016) Investigating Meaning Making in English As A Lingua Franca (ELF), , London: King's College PhD thesis; Kristin, B., Kern, M., Brett, J.M., Managing challenges in multicultural teams (2006) National Culture and Groups (Research on Managing Groups and Teams 9), pp. 233-262. , Ya-Ru Chen (ed.)

In Alessandro Duranti (ed.), A companion to linguistic anthropology, 496-517. Blackwell Publishing), this paper addresses language ideologies expressed by participants of an Academic Writing course taught to undergraduate students majoring in English and Portuguese in a public university in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The data from which participants' language ideologies are interpreted come from two literacy events that integrate a wider set of literacy practices (Street 2000, Literacy events and literacy practices.

Cambridge: Cambridge University Press) in which participants engaged in Moodle, the virtual learning environment of the course. Concerning students' positions, the analysis depicts how they entextualize ELF scholars' language ideologies to either (re/de)construct their own standard native-based language ideology about English or to reinforce this same ideology. The paper also examines the stance adopted by the professor in her responses to students' writings in terms of both her ideological alignment with theories that challenge the role of the native speaker as English expands worldwide and her resistance to naïve and romantic views of this expansion. © 2017 Walter de Gruyter GmbH.","English as a Lingua Franca; language ideologies; literacy events; literacy practices",,,,,,,,,"Mikhail, B., (2010) Para Uma Filosofia Do Ato Responsavel, , 1920-1924 Sao Carlos: Pedro e Joao editores; Mikhail, B., Generos do discurso (2011) Estetica da Criacao Verbal, pp. 262-306. , Mikhail Bakhtin (ed.)

The recordings have been transcribed in their entirety, with conversation analytical procedures and additional ethnographic interviews with the PhD supervisors. The present paper is a follow-up to the two previous studies by the author (in European Journal for Applied Linguistics 3[2], 2015, and The Routledge Handbook of English for Academic Purposes, 2016) and focuses on linguistic competence and content knowledge as factors possibly mitigating the power asymmetry present in the interactions. The findings show no observable power asymmetries manifested in the interactions or in the interview responses by the supervisors. The analyses showed that the supervisors' and the students' level of linguistic competence seemed very similar, which was further supported by the supervisors' self-reports of their own English and their informal evaluations of their students' levels of proficiency. When it comes to content knowledge, the students overall showed very good command of their subjects, disciplinary conventions and their projects in general, further supported by their supervisors' evaluations in the interview data. Based on these findings, it is suggested here that in ELF interactions of this particular type where the speakers have similar levels of linguistic competence and content knowledge, power asymmetries become less visible. © 2017 Walter de Gruyter GmbH.","content knowledge; English as a lingua franca; linguistic competence; PhD supervision; power",,,,,,,,,"John, A., (2009) Science, Language, and Literacy: Case Studies of Learning in Swedish University Physics, , Unpublished PhD thesis Uppsala University; Helen, B., Dialogic interaction (2016) The Routledge Handbook of English for Academic Purposes, pp. 152-164. , Ken Hyland & Philip Shaw (eds.)

Indeed, plurilingual phenomena can be inscribed in a view of ELF communication that sees such practices as a potential asset in intercultural communication. Multicultural competence - which may include the exploitation and integration of other linguacultures - alongside BELF competence and business-specific knowledge is identifiable as an essential skill for successful interactions on the workplace. This paper aims at exploring the domain of internationally oriented business communication in English by analyzing naturally occurring data of workplace interactions involving non-native speakers of English. Specifically, the analysis will look at how non-English linguistic and cultural elements are incorporated in ELF talk in business contexts. The Professional Business section of the VOICE corpus will be analyzed to this purpose through a qualitative approach in order to shed light on the functions of L1 and LN (other languages) cultural and linguistic elements in BELF interactions and their role in conducting successful business transactions. © 2017 Walter de Gruyter GmbH.","accommodation processes; English as a Business Lingua Franca (BELF); English as a Lingua Franca; Global Communicative Competence; plurilingualism; translanguaging",,,,,,,,,"Francesca, B., (2009) The Handbook of Business Discourse, , Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press; Anne-Claude, B., Grin, F., Ludi, G., Exploring the dynamics of multilingualism (2013) The DYLAN Project, , Amsterdam: Benjamins; Angelika, B., Pitzl, M., Majewski, S., Klimpfinger, T., VOICE recording - Methodological challenges in the compilation of a corpus of spoken ELF (2006) Nordic Journal of English Studies, 5 (2), pp. 161-188; Alessia, C., Dewey, M., Efficiency in ELF communication: From pragmatic motives to lexico-grammatical innovation (2006) Nordic Journal of English Studies, 5 (2), pp. 59-93; Alessia, C., Accommodating difference in ELF conversations: A study of pragmatic strategies (2009) English As A Lingua Franca: Studies and Findings, pp. 254-273. , Anna Mauranen & Elina Ranta (eds.)

It focuses in particular on the perceived values of the host country language (Arabic) versus English as a language franca (ELF). While there have been a number of explorations of the value of learning the host country language for migrants in terms of both labour market outcomes and wellbeing, there is a paucity of, and pressing need for, studies investigating the value of ELF for economic migrants, particularly those from developing country contexts. This article presents the findings from an ethnographic study which explores the experiences, perceptions and specific language-related issues of a diverse cohort of returnee migrants from rural Bangladesh where, despite significant migration from the area, little is known about this population's language use and communicative needs. Our findings suggest that both the host country language (Arabic) and ELF have important functional values, but that these vary depending on interlocutors, domains of work and contexts of situation, as well as on the relative statuses (within an ecology of global linguistic value) of the two languages in different contexts. The analysis thus provides fresh and significant evidence regarding the role of language in economic migration and development for low-skilled migrants, both to and from contexts in which English has no official status. The article concludes by considering the implications for the types of language education which might be most suitable for these and other economic migrants in comparable contexts. © 2017 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston 2017.","Arabic; Bangladesh; economic migration; host country languages",,,,,,,,,"Afsar, R., (2009) Unravelling the Vicious Cycle of Recruitment: Labour Migration from Bangladesh to the Gulf States, , International Labour Office (ILO) Working Paper 63; Ahmed, M.N., Temporary movement of natural persons (TMNP): Prospects and constraints of Bangladesh (2011) International Journal of Business and Management, 6 (2), pp. 77-92; (2015) Mobile Phone Users in Bangladesh Cross 130 Million Mark, , http://bdnews24.com/business/2015/10/01/mobile-phone-users-in-bangladesh-cross-130-million-mark, BDNews24; Bender, K.A., Mridha, H.A., Peoples, J., Risk compensation for hospital workers: Evidence from relative wages of janitors (2006) Industrial & Labor Relations Review, 59 (2), pp. 226-242; Buchenau, J., (2008) Migration, Remittances and Poverty Alleviation in Bangladesh: Report and Proposal, , Dhaka: United Nations Development Program; (2009) About BMET, , http://www.bmet.gov.bd/BMET/index, Bureau of Manpower, Employment and Training (BMET) (accessed on 12 July 2015); (2016) Overseas Employment & Remittances from 1976 to 2015, , http://www.bmet.gov.bd/BMET/viewStatReport.action?reportnumber=18, Bureau of Manpower, Employment and Training (BMET); (2016) Overseas Employment of Female Workers from 1991 to 2016, , http://www.bmet.gov.bd/BMET/viewStatReport.action?reportnumber=39, Bureau of Manpower, Employment and Training (BMET); Chiswick, B.R., Miller, P.W., The endogeneity between language and earnings: International analyses (1995) Journal of Labor Economics, 13 (2), pp. 246-288; Chiswick, B.R., Miller, P.W., The complementarity of language and other human capital: Immigrant earnings in Canada (2003) Economics of Education Review, 22 (5), pp. 469-480; Clark, K., Drinkwater, S., The labour-market performance of recent migrants (2008) Oxford Review of Economic Policy, 24 (3), pp. 495-516; Coleman, H., (2010) The English Language in Development, , http://www.teachingenglish.org.uk/publications/english-language-development, British Council; Dustmann, C., Fabbri, F., Language proficiency and labour market performance of immigrants in the UK (2003) Economic Journal, 113, pp. 695-717; Dustmann, C., Van Soest, A., Language fluency and earnings: Estimation with misclassified language indicators (2001) Review of Economics and Statistics, 83, pp. 663-674; Erling, E.J., Power, T., (2014) Synthesis Report: Evidence of the Relationship between English and Economic Gain in Bangladesh, , English in Action, Dhaka, Bangladesh; Erling, E.J., Seargeant, P., Solly, M., English in rural Bangladesh: How is language education perceived as a resource for development in rural communities?

Examples and analysis are provided to illustrate the common non-standard lexicogrammar features in terms of lexical innovation, non-standard use of prepositions, the omission of subjects, objects and copula, grammatical disagreement, subject pronoun copying and tag question. These non-standard forms appear to be adopted due to mother tongue transfer, facilitation of communication or exploitation of language resources.

The Asian Corpus of English (ACE) project has, as one of its defining goals, the collection of a million-word corpus of naturally occurring speech in order to analyse and describe the distinctive linguistic features of Asian ELF and to identify shared features if any. However, little research has been done hitherto on the features of ELF in the Asian context. This paper, therefore, presents a description of the phonological patterns found in ELF. Specifically, the paper focuses, inter alia, on the monophthong vowels and rhythmic patterning in the spoken interactions of ELF speakers from the data as well as the implications for policy and practice of ELF in multilingual Asia. The study is based on the Asian Corpus of English (ACE) data collected in Singapore by the National Institute of Education (NIE) team. Participants in the study include speakers from China, Singapore, the Philippines, Indonesia and India. The paper aims to deepen the boundaries of thinking about shared pronunciation patternings of ELF speakers in Asia and considers the implications of such shared patternings and norms on practice in multilingual Asia.","Ace corpus; Expanding circle; Outer circle; Rhythm; Vowel",,,,,,,,,"Ao, R., Low, E.L., A description of the yunnan English accent (2016) World Englishes, 35 (1), pp. 18-41; Boersma, P., Weenink, D., (2010) Praat: Doing Phonetics by Computer (Version 5.2.35) [Software], , http://fon.hum.uva.nl/praat/, Downloaded from; Bolton, K., English in Asia, Asian Englishes, and the issue of proficiency (2008) English Today, 24 (2), pp. 3-12; Deterding, D., The formants of monophthong vowels in standard Southern British english pronunciation (1997) Journal of the International Phonetic Association, 27, pp. 47-55; Deterding, D., The measurement of rhythm: A comparison of Singapore and British English (2001) Journal of Phonetics, 29, pp. 217-230; Deterding, D., An instrumental study of the monophthong vowels of Singapore English (2003) English World-Wide, 24 (1), pp. 1-16; Deterding, D., The north wind versus a Wolf: Short texts for the description and measurement of English pronunciation (2006) Journal of the International Phonetic Association, 36, pp. 187-196; Deterding, D., Norms for pronunciation in Southeast Asia (2010) World Englishes, 29 (3), pp. 363-377; Deterding, D., (2013) Misunderstandings in English as a Lingua Franca: An Analysis of ELF Interactions in Southeast Asia, , Boston & Berlin: De Gruyter Mouton; Deterding, D., Kirkpatrick, A., Emerging Southeast Asian Englishes and intelligibility (2006) World Englishes, 25 (3-4), pp. 391-409; Grabe, E., Low, E.L., Durational variability in speech and the rhythm class hypothesis (2002) Laboratory Phonology, 7, pp. 515-546. , Carlos Gussenhoven & Natasha Warner (eds.), Berlin: Mouton de Gruyter; Hayward, K., (2000) Experimental Phonetics, , Essex: Pearson Education Limited; Kachru, B.B., (1982) The other Tongue: English across Cultures, , Urbana, IL: University of Illinois Press; Kachru, B.B., Teaching world Englishes (1992) The other Tongue: English across Cultures, pp. 355-365. , Braj B.

Though they are the exception to the norm, and furthermore they do not necessarily result in communication breakdown, they do sometimes occur, and it is important to find out what causes them. Deterding (2013. Misunderstandings in English as a lingua franca: An analysis of ELF interactions in South-East Asia. Berlin & New York: Mouton de Gruyter.) investigates misunderstandings in English as a Lingua Franca (ELF) in data from the Asian Corpus of English (ACE) and discusses the role of phonological, lexical and grammatical features in causing them to occur. He reports that over 86% of the tokens of misunderstandings in his corpus involve pronunciation. The current paper analyses this data further, specifically to determine the role of vowels, as Jenkins (2000. The phonology of English as an international language. Oxford: Oxford University Press.) has suggested that vowel quality is not important in English as a Lingua Franca, so she excludes vowel quality from the Lingua Franca Core, the set of pronunciation features that she suggests are important formaintaining intelligibility in an international setting. In fact, a total of over half the tokens of misunderstanding listed in Deterding's Misunderstandings in English as a Lingua Franca involve the quality of vowels, though in many cases this appears to be a minor factor. The current paper analyses these 98 tokens involving vowel quality in detail, to find out if some shifts in vowel quality are more important than others, and to investigate if vowel quality really is unimportant for intelligibility in English as a Lingua Franca. It was found that vowel quality rarely causes a problem, and only in one token, in which the speaker was making a joke, is vowel quality the main factor causing the misunderstanding.","Intelligibility; Lingua franca core; Misunderstandings; Vowel quality",,,,,,,,,"Baskaran, L., Malaysian english: Phonology (2004) A Handbook of Varieties of English, 1, pp. 1034-1046. , Edgar W.

The data reported here draw on the Asian Corpus of English (ACE), and describe some of the more typical teasing practices which occur among Asian ELF speakers in informal, non-Taskfocused contexts. More specifically, this research explores the interpersonal functions which teasing performs in ACE interactions; the teasing strategies commonly employed to serve these functions; and the responses of recipients to teases targeting them. The data show that teasing is a common practice in interaction among Asian ELF speakers, and is accomplished through a variety of strategies such as jocular mockery, jocular agreement with a target's negative self-Assessment, jocular insult, and banter. Significantly, teasing in ACE appears to be essentially jocular rather than conveying veiled aggression; markers such as laughter, heightened vocal pitch and lexical exaggeration are commonly employed to signpost the non-serious nature of such utterances. Teases are also commonly received as jocular by recipients; there are no instances of offense being expressed by a tease recipient.","Asian corpus of english; English as a lingua franca; Pragmatics; Spoken interaction; Teasing",,,,,,,,,"(2014) Asian Corpus of English (ACE), , http://corpus.ied.edu.hk/ace/; Ahvenainen, T., (2005) Problem-solving Mechanisms in Information Exchange Dialogues with English as a Lingua Franca, , Jyväskylä: University of Jyväskylä licentiate thesis; Alberts, J., Kellar-Guenther, Y., Corman, S., That's not funny: Understanding recipients' responses to teasing (1996) Western Journal of Communication, 60 (4), pp. 337-357; Armstrong, S.A., (1992) Teasables, Teases, and Responses in Conversational Teasing Sequences, , Carbondale, IL: Southern Illinois University at Carbondale MA thesis; Attardo, S., Humor and irony in interaction: From mode adoption to failure of detection (2002) Emerging Communication, 3, pp. 159-180; Béal, C., Mullan, K., Issues in conversational humour from a cross-cultural perspective: Comparing French and Australian corpora (2013) Cross-culturally Speaking, Speaking Cross-culturally, pp. 107-139. , Bert Peeters, Kerry Mullan & Christine Béal (eds.), Newcastle: Cambridge Scholars Publishing; Bjørge, A.K., Expressing disagreement in ELF business negotiations: Theory and practice (2012) Applied Linguistics, 33 (4), pp. 406-427; Blythe, J., From passing-gesture to 'true' romance: Kin-based teasing in Murriny patha conversation (2012) Journal of Pragmatics, 44 (4), pp. 508-528; Boxer, D., Cortés-Conde, F., From bonding to biting: Conversational joking and identity display (1997) Journal of Pragmatics, 27, pp. 275-294; Brown, P., Levinson, S.C., (1987) Politeness: Some Universals in Language Usage, , Cambridge: Cambridge University Press; Chiaro, D., Cultural divide or unifying factor?

It has been argued that English, as a foreign ""working language,"" does not have an emotive value to it as it has merely a functional role. This, however, may change as many people in ASEAN speak a particular variety of English, especially those from countries such as Malaysia, Singapore, Philippines and Brunei. Even in countries such as Cambodia, Laos and Vietnam, which had not been colonised by the British, many learn English today and see it as vital for survival in many domains and especially with the forming of the ASEAN community and ASEAN integration. This ASEAN English is different from the many varieties in the region in that it does not possess the national and ethnic characteristics that varieties do. ASEAN English appears to possess its own characteristic features, often with an avoidance of features that are found in national varieties to aid mutual understanding between members who come from different ASEAN societies. This paper examines informal interactions between ASEAN speakers from the Asian Corpus of English. It analyses the features that create rapport and illustrates that ELF has an emotive value and does not merely play a functional role in ASEAN.","Asean; English; Identity; Lingua franca; Regionalism",,,,,,,,,"Acharya, A., (2009) Whose Ideas Matter?

Some disciplinary areas, such as Sociology, which have traditionally been dominated by Anglophone writers, are witness to an increasing number of non-native academics publishing in their most prestigious journals, hosted either in the United States or in Great Britain. This may have implications for the way academic texts are being written. This paper focuses on the evolution of the prestigious journal Social Science Research since it was launched in 1972. My research hypothesis is that the fact that an increasing number of non-Anglophone writers are contributing to the journal may be modifying the rhetorical level of the research article abstracts. The analysis carried out in this study identifies processes of evolution in terms of simplification of the conventional rhetorical structure used for abstracts, and hybridization, which in fact involves a higher degree of textual complexity. The new, hybrid, patterns identified here may be the result of processes of contact and evolution, reshaping old forms into new forms that model English conventional patterns in innovative and creative ways. Further enquiry is needed to test the preliminary results yielded by the present study.","EAL; ELF; Hybridity; Research article abstract; Rhetorical structure; Simplicity; Sociology; Written academic english",,,,,,,,,"Alharbi, L.M., Swales, J.M., Arabic and English abstracts in bilingual language science journals: Same or different?

Findings from analyses of various corpora show that there exists a relatively small set of preferred words that speakers of English rely on regardless of where the interaction takes place, with whom they are interacting, and what the purpose of the interaction is. Results also show that these lexical preferences are consistently prevalent to the extent that it is possible to advance the hypothesis that a relatively stable dominant vocabulary dynamically emerges out of ELF speaker interactions in order to serve certain communicative functions.","Communication strategies; Dominant vocabulary; Elf; Elfa; Ice; Vocabulary use; Voice",,,,,,,,,"Bauer, L., Nation, P., Word families (1993) International Journal of Lexicography, 6 (4), pp. 253-279; Biber, D., Conrad, S., (2009) Register, Genre, and Style, , Cambridge, UK & New York: Cambridge University Press; Blommaert, J., Rampton, B., Language and superdiversity (2011) Diversities, 13 (2), pp. 1-22. , www.unesco.org/shs/diversities/vol13/issue2/art1, accessed 30 August 2015; Breiteneder, A., Pitzl, M.-L., Majewski, S., Klimpfinger, T., VOICE recording - methodological challenges in the compilation of a corpus of spoken ELF (2006) Nordic Journal Of, English Studies, 5 (2), pp. 161-188; Carey, R., On the other side: Formulaic organizing chunks in spoken and written academic ELF (2013) Journal of English as a Lingua Franca, 2 (2), pp. 207-228; Cogo, A., Strategic use and perceptions of english as a Lingua Franca (2010) Poznan Studies In, Contemporary Linguistics, 46 (3), pp. 295-312; Cogo, A., ELF and super-diversity: A case study of ELF multilingual practices from a business context (2012) Journal of English as a Lingua Franca, 1 (2), pp. 287-313; Cogo, A., Dewey, M., Efficiency in ELF communication: From pragmatic motives to lexico-grammatical innovation (2006) Nordic Journal of English Studies, 5 (2), pp. 59-93; (2013) The Vienna-Oxford International Corpus of English - Course Description, , http://www.univie.ac.at/voice/page/corpus_description, Corpus Description.

Teacher education prepares students for a certain educational system and usually it is the one in which the students are themselves educated. International higher education programmes in countries where English is not an official language use English as a lingua franca (ELF) for teaching and learning. However, participants come to a communicative situation with their own history, past experiences, knowledge, and their own frames of reference. This article looks at an excerpt from a particular university teaching session in English-medium instruction (EMI) teacher education in Finland where a group of international students from diverse educational, linguistic, and cultural backgrounds negotiate for meaning and common understanding. A discussion about an ethical dilemma related to student assessment is analyzed qualitatively turn-by-Turn to show how communicative resources help overcome mis-And non-understanding that stems from, besides linguistic difficulties, understanding contexts in different ways. The achievement of mutual intelligibility and individual learning required the participation of many to allow for the linguistic challenges of understanding less familiar varieties and uses of English, and interpret the cultural and contextual levels behind the utterances.","Co-construction of communication; EMI teacher education; English as a lingua franca; Intelligibility; Negotiation of meaning",,,,,,,,,"Airey, J., Linder, C., Language and the experience of learning university physics in Sweden (2006) European Journal of Physics, 27 (3), pp. 553-560; Baird, R., Baker, W., Kitazawa, M., The complexity of ELF (2014) Journal of English as a Lingua, Franca, 3 (1), pp. 171-196; Baker, W., The cultures of English as a lingua franca (2009) Tesol Quarterly, 43 (4), pp. 567-592; Biggs, J.B., Tang, C., (2011) Teaching for Quality Learning at University, , 4th edn.

A WE-And ELF-informed teacher education can indeed play a pivotal role in promoting awareness of the sociolinguistic and cultural changes brought about by the pluralization of English on the one hand, and of its function as a lingua franca on the other hand, and contribute to fostering a critical evaluation of ELT approaches, and materials, traditionally based on an Anglo-centric monolithic view of language and culture, taking account of different viewpoints in connection to the current modified reality of English. This paper will illustrate findings from an ongoing research study aimed at investigating trainee teachers' beliefs concerning ELT pedagogic practices inclusive of the current pluralization of English. The study has been carried out with trainee teachers of English attending pre-service TFA (Tirocinio Formativo Attivo) and PAS (Percorso Abilitante Speciale) teacher education courses at the Department of Foreign Languages and Literatures, University of Verona, Italy, where part of the English Language course focused on issues related to WE, ELF and their pedagogical implications. By means of questionnaires and interviews, as well as class reflections and materials developed by the trainees as part of the course, the aim was to investigate to what extent a WE-And ELF-Aware teacher education can contribute to expanding and/or modifying teachers' awareness of the above issues in pedagogical terms. Findings related to the participants' comments and practical proposals for the inclusion of WE-And ELF-informed activities in their teaching practices, as well as their critical reflections about problematic points, particularly in the local context and syllabi, will also be discussed.","ELF; ELT; Global englishes; Teacher education; We-And ELF-Aware classroom practices",,,,,,,,,"Alptekin, C., Redefining multicompetence for bilingualism and ELF (2010) International Journal of Applied Linguistics, 20 (1), pp. 95-110; Alsagoff, L., McKay, S.L., Hu, G., Renadya, W.A., (2012) Principles and Practices for Teaching English as An International Language, , (eds).

This new form of English has distinctive Chinese characteristics and serves a variety of communicative, social and political purposes in response to the Post-Multilingualism challenges in China and beyond. I approach New Chinglish from a Translanguaging perspective, a theoretical perspective that is intended to raise fundamental questions about the validity of conventional views of language and communication and to contribute to the understanding of the Post-Multilingualism challenges that we face in the twenty-first century.","China; ELF; New chinglish; Post-multilingualism; Translanguaging",,,,,,,,,"Adamson, J., David, C., Translanguaging in English academic writing preparation (2015) International Journal of Pedagogies and Learning, 10 (1), pp. 24-37; Agha, A., The social life of cultural value (2003) Language and Communication, 23 (3-4), pp. 231-273; Agha, A., Voice, footing, enregisterment (2005) Journal of Linguistic Anthropology, 15 (1), pp. 38-59; Baker, C., (2001) Foundations of Bilingual Bducation and Bilingualism, , 3rd edn.
