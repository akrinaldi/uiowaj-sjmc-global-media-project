We bring attention to the role of sport communication scholars in the advancement of social justice goals and articulate a set of dispositions for researchers to bring to their practice, predicated on internalizing and centralizing morality, ethics, and the political. Identifying the epistemological (under)currents in the meaningful study of communication and sport, we offer a set of challenges for researchers in the contemporary critique of the communication industries based on “sensibilities” or dispositions of the research to those studied. We then introduce and frame the 13 articles that make up this double special issue of Communication & Sport. Collectively, these articles begin to demonstrate such dispositions in their interrogation of some of the most important and spectacularized acts of social justice campaigns and activism in recent decades alongside investigations of everyday forms of marginalization, resistance, and collective action that underpin social change—both progressive and regressive. We hope this special issue provides a vehicle for continued work in the area of sports communication and social justice. © The Author(s) 2020.","athlete activism; platforms; power; protest; social justice; sports communication",,,,,,,,,"Andrews, D., Silk, M., Towards a physical cultural studies (2011) Sociology of Sport Journal, 28 (1), pp. 4-35; Bennett, W.L., Segerberg, A., (2013) The logic of connective action: Digital media and the personalization of contentious politics, , University Press; Brunner, E., Wild public networks and protest in China: Environmental activism on the screens of social media and streets of Maoming (2017) Journal of Communication, 67 (5), pp. 665-677; Christians, C., Ethics and politics in qualitative research (2005) The Sage handbook of qualitative research, pp. 139-164. , Denzin N.K., Lincoln Y.S., (eds), 3rd ed, Sage, (Eds.), (,.,., –; Colás, Y., Ball don’t lie!” Rasheed Wallace and the politics of protest in the National Basketball Association (2016) Communication & Sport, 4 (2), pp. 123-144. , https://doi.org/10.1177/2167479515572811; Collins, P.H., (1991) Black feminist thought, , Routledge; Denzin, N.K., The practices and politics of interpretation (2000) Handbook of qualitative research, pp. 897-922. , Denzin N.K., Lincoln Y.S., (eds), 2nd ed, Sage, (Eds.), (,.,., –; Denzin, N.K., Cultural studies in America after September 11, 2001 (2002) Cultural Studies ↔ Critical Methodologies, 2, pp. 5-8; Denzin, N.K., Emancipatory discourses and the ethics and politics of interpretation (2005) The Sage handbook of qualitative research, pp. 933-958. , Denzin N.K., Lincoln Y.S., (eds), 3rd ed, Sage, (Eds.), (,.,., –; Fine, M., Weis, L., Weseen, S., Wong, L., For whom?

Meanwhile, sports media and others echoed the call for unity and largely dropped discussion of the commitment to social justice that had originally animated Kaepernick’s protest. This essay argues that claims to unity are rooted in the logic of consensus, a value in democratic theory that offers an illusion of peaceful cooperation while denying important conflicts and differences. As understood through the rhetorical tradition and theories of agonistic democracy, athletic activism in the NFL has been important precisely because it disrupts the illusion of unity on which the national anthem ritual rests. In short, contesting unity and consensus seeks to identify communicative resources that facilitate social justice in and through sport. © The Author(s) 2020.","agonism; athlete activism; Colin Kaepernick; consensus; NFL; rhetoric; unity",,,,,,,,,"Anderson, B., (1991) Imagined communities: Reflections on the origins and spread of nationalism, , Verso, Original work published 1983; Anderson, L., (2014) The storm and the tide: Tragedy, hope and triumph in Tuscaloosa, , Sports Illustrated Books; Bach, T., Speech on the occasion of the adoption of Olympic truce resolution (2017) International Olympic Committee, , https://olympic.org.bb/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Speech-Olympic-Truce-Resolution-for-PyeongChang-2018-AS-DELIVERED.pdf, November, 13; Beasley, V.B., (2004) You, the People: American national identity in presidential rhetoric, , Texas A&M University Press; Belson, K., Davis, J.H., Trump attacks warriors’ curry: LeBron James’s retort: “U bum.

This study examines the framing of this game in the print and online media and in public responses via comments on media coverage and comments on Facebook posts. The framing of both the media coverage and the public response was predominantly supportive, with the theme of the “inclusion,” of gay Australian Football League players and the broader LGBTIQ community, prominent. However, there was a significant difference in the frames used in media coverage compared to the public response to this coverage. There was a relatively high proportion of unsupportive comments (e.g., a “stick to football” theme), including pernicious homophobia, present, particularly in the public response, compared to other recent related research. Overall, the findings suggest that, while there was strong support for the Pride Game, homophobia in sport remains, and the media, particularly social media, can be a platform for its expression. This study also highlights the value in analysing multiple platforms in media framing research. © The Author(s) 2020.","Australian football; homophobia; media framing; Pride Game; public framing; social media;

An element frequently overlooked is the role of place in sports protests. Stadiums are iconic markers of identity for communities and play a significant role in the media’s representation of sports games. Informed by Endres and Senda-Cook’s research about place-in-protest, I argue how the Botham Jean and O’Shae Terry protests outside AT&T Stadium in Dallas functioned as place-as-rhetoric to build on the intended purpose of the stadium while temporarily reconstructing its meaning. This material enactment is achieved by the stadium serving as a performative space that authorizes new meaning onto the stadium and surrounding space while heralding it as a champion marker of social justice. I position my analysis within a framework that understands how sports stadiums deploy material rhetoric in ways that produce embodied rhetoric and ephemeral rhetoric that legitimize the Jean and Terry protests as social justice protests. I argue that the stadium functions as place-in-rhetoric to capitalize on its mobilization of fandom in order to amplify social justice messages to a wider audience. © The Author(s) 2020.","place-as-rhetoric; protest; social justice; sport; stadium",,,,,,,,,"(2018) Dallas demonstrators protest outside Cowboys’ stadium, , https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwQkNqvcW_Q&list=PLMsil8SbTBMUjpRmt16Ha2MdP_9LqpB1d&index=4&t=0s; Badenhousen, K., The world’s 50 most valuable sports teams 2019 (2019) Forbes.com, , https://www.forbes.com, July, 22; Blair, C., Contemporary US memorial sites as exemplars of rhetoric’s materiality (1999) Rhetorical bodies, pp. 16-57. , Selzer J., Crowley S., (eds), University of Wisconsin Press, (Eds.), (., –; Bond, S., The sports arena has always been a venue for protest (2017) Forbes.com, , https://www.forbes.com, September, 25; Burroughs, B., Rugg, A., Becker, D., Edgmon, M., #VegasStrong: Sport, public memorialization, and the Golden Knights (2019) Communication & Sport, , https://doi.org/10.1177/2167479519855085; Butterworth, M., Saved at home: Christian branding and faith nights in the ‘Church of baseball (2011) Quarterly Journal of Speech, 97, pp. 309-333. , https://doi.org/10.1080/00335630.2011.585170, ’; Butterworth, M., Public memorializing in the stadium: Mediated sport, the 10th anniversary of 9/11, and the illusion of democracy (2014) Communication & Sport, 2, pp. 203-224. , https://doi.org/10.1177/2167479513485735; (2018) Protesters holding caskets march near AT&T Stadium for police shooting victims, , https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Hy5vy9yQUg&list=PLMsil8SbTBMUjpRmt16Ha2MdP_9LqpB1d&index=6&t=0s; Eckstein, R., Delaney, K., New sports stadiums, community self-esteem, and community collective conscience (2002) Journal of Sport and Social Issues, 26, pp. 235-247. , https://doi.org/10.1177/0193723502263002; Endres, D., Senda-Cook, S., Location matters: The rhetoric of place in protest (2011) Quarterly Journal of Speech, 97, pp. 257-282. , https://doi.org/10.1080/00335630.2011.585167; Gasoi, L., The mediated arena: Re-image-ining the epideictic in the digital age (2017) The Poster, 5, pp. 29-52. , https://doi.org/10.1386/post.5.29_1; George, B., Cowboys owner Jerry Jones: Any player who is ‘disrespectful to the flag’ won’t be allowed to play (2017) The Dallas Morning News, , https://www.dallasnews.com, October, 8; Grano, D.A., Zagacki, K.S., Cleansing the superdome: The paradox of purity and post-Katrina guilt (2011) Quarterly Journal of Speech, 97, pp. 201-223. , https://doi.org/10.1080/00335630.2011.560175; Huberty, L.L., Kellison, T.B., Mondello, M., Fan mobilization and the Minnesota sport-stadium campaign (2016) International Journal of Sport Communication, 9, pp. 191-208. , https://doi.org/10.1123/1JSC.2015-0118; Jones, S., Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones behaves like slave owner over NFL kneeling policy (2018) Fort Worth Star-Telegram, , https://www.star-telegram.com, August, 2; Pfau, M., The Louisiana Superdome and the semiotics of disaster (2017) Iconic sports venues: Persuasion in public spaces, pp. 157-176. , Johannesen D., Huglen M.E., (eds), Peter Lang, (Eds.), (., –; (2018) Open letter to Jerry Jones by Pastor Dr. Frederick D.

Recently, academics and sports journalists have noted a “rebirth” of athlete activism in the United States. Despite the activism of women of color, who have initiated and been at the center of these movements, and sportswomen’s outspokenness on a variety of social justice issues, women’s roles are rendered invisible in narratives that instead privilege sportsmen or men’s professional leagues. We examine articulations of feminism in the context of athlete activism and re-center the role of sportswomen. Drawing upon social media, official statements from athletes, and online news media coverage, we locate feminist narratives in networked communication, specifically in the Women’s National Basketball Association’s activism as it relates to #BlackLivesMatter and the U.S. women’s soccer equal pay lawsuit. Our analytical approach is attuned to how feminism circulates in an economy of visibility, where certain feminisms become more visible than others. Our findings illustrate how narratives of solidarity and collectivism are informed by articulations of intersectional and neoliberal feminisms. This article concludes with a call for sports media scholars to tell stories differently. © The Author(s) 2020.","#BlackLivesMatter; athlete activism; equal pay; feminism; media; United States Women’s National Team; Women’s National Basketball Association",,,,,,,,,"Alexander, M., (2012) The new Jim Crow: Mass incarceration in the age of colorblindness, , Penguin; Bachman, R., U.S. women’s soccer games outearned men’s games (2019) Wall Street Journal, , https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-womens-soccer-games-out-earned-mens-games-11560765600, June, 17; Baker, C.N., Working harder, earning less: Inside the women’s soccer team lawsuit for equal pay (2019) Ms. Magazine, , https://msmagazine.com/2019/07/08/working-harder-earning-less-inside-the-womens-soccer-team-lawsuit-for-equal-pay/, July, 8; Banet-Weiser, S., (2018) Empowered: Popular feminism and popular misogyny, , Duke University Press; Baxter, K., U.S. women’s soccer players sue for equal treatment just months before World Cup (2019) The Los Angeles Times, , https://www.latimes.com/sports/soccer/la-sp-us-womens-soccer-lawsuit-20190308-story.html, March, 8; Berkman, S., In a pioneering moment for the WNBA, players unite in protests over injustices (2016) The New York Times, , https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/16/sports/basketball/wnba-players-protests.html, October, 15, (, a; Berkman, S., Quiet protest helped Tina Charles find her voice (2016) The New York Times, , https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/31/sports/basketball/tina-charles-new-york-liberty-wnba-protest.html, July, 30, (, b; Bianchi, M., Alex Morgan on USWNT equal pay lawsuit: “This is about women in all industries (2019) Pro Soccer USA, , https://www.prosoccerusa.com/us-soccer/womens-world-cup/uswnt-equal-pay-mike-bianchi/, March, 14; Blades, L.A., WNBA players protest for Black Lives Matter despite league punishments (2016) Teen Vogue, , https://www.teenvogue.com/story/wnba-players-protest-black-lives-matter, October, 17; Borders, L., Inspiring and empowering women: The WNBA leading the way into the 21st century (2018) Journal of Legal Aspects of Sport, 28, pp. 121-125; Bruce, T., New rules for new times: Sportswomen and media representation in the third wave (2016) Sex Roles, 74, pp. 361-376. , https://doi.org/10.1007/s11199-015-0497-6; Bryant, H., (2018) The Heritage: Black athletes, a divided America, and the politics of patriotism, , Beacon Press; Cauterucci, C., The WNBA’s Black Lives Matter protest has set a new standard for sports activism (2016) Slate, , https://slate.com/human-interest/2016/07/the-wnbas-black-lives-matter-protest-has-set-new-standard-for-sports-activism.html, July, 25; Chappell, B., U.S. women’s soccer team members file federal equal pay complaint (2016) National Public Radio, , https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/03/31/472522790/members-of-u-s-women-s-national-team-file-federal-equal-pay-complaint, March, 31; Coakley, J.J., (2017) Sports and society: Issues and controversies, , 12th ed, McGraw-Hill Education; Collins, P.H., (2008) Black feminist thought: Knowledge, consciousness, and the politics of empowerment, , Routledge; Cooky, C., We cannot stand idly by”: A necessary call for a public sociology of sport (2017) Sociology of Sport Journal, 34, pp. 1-32. , (, a; Cooky, C., Women, sports, and activism (2017) The Oxford handbook of U.S. women’s social movement activism, pp. 602-622. , McCammon H., Taylor V., Reger J., Einwohner R., (eds), Oxford University Press, (, b)., (Eds.), (., –; Cooky, C., What’s new about sporting femininities: Female athletes and the sport-media industrial complex (2018) New sporting femininities: Embodied politics in postfeminist times, pp. 23-41. , Toffoletti K., Thorpe H., Francombe-Webb J., (eds), Palgrave, (Eds.), (., –; Cooky, C., Messner, M.A., Musto, M., It’s dude time!

The success of that media coverage was consolidated and built upon for Rio 2016 and has been attributed in huge part to the success of the marketing. Drawing on interviews with the key decision makers, conducted shortly after Channel 4’s historic 2012 Paralympic media coverage, my empirical material illuminates how the process of changing perceptions relied heavily on branded meanings. Alongside the unorthodox visual portrayals, partnerships with familiar brands were felt to be necessary to help resonate normal feelings for digital consumers and reinforce mainstream cultural acceptance. It was not enough to just change televisual representations of para-sports bodies and saturate the TV/online schedule with elite status programming, the producers knew they needed to use meanings associated with commodified brands to reassure the public as well. This study is based on corporate internal documentation as well as interviews with executive and creative decision makers working for the UK’s Paralympic broadcaster, Channel 4. It reveals a production practice that is not normally associated with bringing marginalised groups to the mainstream media attention. © The Author(s) 2020.","broadcasting; disability; Paralympics; production; representation; sport",,,,,,,,,"Aaker, D.A., (2002) Building strong brands, , Free Press; Aronczyk, M., Powers, D., (2010) Blowing up the brand: Critical perspectives on promotional culture, , Peter Lang; Asquith, K., Hearn, A., Promotional prime time: ‘Advertainment’, internal network promotion, and the future of Canadian television (2012) Canadian Journal of Communication, 37, pp. 241-257; Bandelji, N., Wherry, F., (2011) The cultural wealth of nations, , Stanford; Banet-Weiser, S., (2012) Authentic TM: The politics of ambivalence in a brand culture, , New York University Press; Barnes, C., (1992) Disabling imagery and the media: An exploration of the principles for media representations of disabled people, , Ryburn; (2012) Viewers feel more positive towards disabled people, , http://bdrc-continental.com/opinions; Billings, A.C., (2008) Olympic media: Inside the biggest show on television, , Routledge; Born, G., (2004) Uncertain vision: Birt, Dyke and the reinvention of the BBC, , Secker & Warburg; Brittain, I., Media, marketing and disability sport (2012) Routledge Online Studies on the Olympic and Paralympic Games, 1, pp. 72-90; (2009) Proposal for UK broadcast rights, , [Corporate Document], Author; (2011) Mental 4 the Paralympics, , [Corporate Powerpoint], A.

Drawing from an 8-month digital ethnography of 50 different social media profiles across four different platforms (Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, and Twitter) and interviews with 20 Muslim sportswomen, we reveal some of the various ways they are using social media to challenge dominant portrayals of Muslim women as in need of “saving”. We draw upon and elaborate Nirmal Puwar’s concept of “space invaders” to explain how Muslim sportswomen are using social media to challenge dominant discourses, build connections, and represent aspects of their sporting lives in culturally specific ways. The article focuses on two key strategies of the sportswomen, firstly their political use of hashtags and secondly the diverse politics of everyday visibilities. Ultimately, this article creates space for Muslim sportswomen’s voices to reveal the various culturally specific forms of agency and politics being employed in the digital realm. © The Author(s) 2020.","activism; Muslim sportswomen; politics; self-representation; social media",,,,,,,,,"Abu-Lughod, L., Do Muslim women really need saving?

Drawing from interviews with 31 National Collegiate Athletic Association Division I collegiate athlete activists from across the United States, this study examined contemporary definitions of collegiate athlete activism for advancing social justice efforts. Five different conceptualizations of social justice activism emerged during the interviews: activism as social justice action, mentorship, authenticity, intervention, and public acts of resistance. Findings document changing notions of athlete activism and reveal nuanced forms of situational activism that do not rely on public expressions of resistance but rather are woven carefully into the fabric that makes up the athletes’ everyday lives. For these athletes, the image of an activist is not so much that of one walking in the streets but rather that of one using the social power they have as an athlete to promote strategic change in everyday situations. Limitations, directions for future research, and implications for praxis are discussed. © The Author(s) 2020.","activism; higher education; intercollegiate athletics; NCAA; social justice; student-athletes",,,,,,"Bowling Green State University, BGSU","The author would like to express sincere gratitude to Drs.

The sample consisted of 160 wheelchair basketball and 160 able-bodied basketball articles published over five seasons in seven online, student-led news sources at universities with wheelchair sports programs. This analysis contrasts previous studies of adaptive sports coverage, which focused primarily on professional journalists’ portrayals of the Paralympics. The framing of wheelchair basketball players as high-performance, physical athletes was scarce when compared to the coverage of able-bodied athletes. Overall, wheelchair basketball was portrayed as lacking legitimacy. When performance of wheelchair basketball players and teams was noted, references to performance statistics, emphasis on the physical and psychological demands of the sport, and the use of literary devices were scarce. In contrast, able-bodied players were framed as talented, legitimate athletes and warriors fighting important battles for their teams. Critical disability theoretical implications are discussed. A discussion of practical implications for adaptive sports journalists, student sports reporters, and collegiate wheelchair basketball concludes the study. © The Author(s) 2019.","adaptive sport; disability; framing; student newspaper; wheelchair basketball",,,,,,,,,"Altheide, D.L., (1996) Qualitative media analysis, , 38, Sage; Asofsky, E., Sam McLaurin, ‘Illini’s invisible man (2013) The Daily Illini, , http://dailyillini.com/uncategorized/2013/02/15/sam-mclaurin-illinis-invisible-man/, February, 15, Retrieved from, (,).,.’; Barnett, B., Framing rape: An examination of public relations strategies in the duke university lacrosse case (2008) Communication, Culture & Critique, 1, pp. 179-202; Beacom, A., French, L., Kendall, S., Reframing impairment?

Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate how people perceive athlete activism relative to news media framing and to examine the effects of athlete activism on endorsed brands. Two experimental design studies were conducted. Results indicate that news media influenced individuals’ attitudes toward the protesting athlete. Additionally, prior perceptions of the protesting athlete and the brand were significantly associated with attitudes toward the protesting athlete and the endorsed brand regardless of the news media framing conditions. A strong positive relationship between the protesting athlete and the endorsed brand was found. Participants with more positive attitudes toward the protesting athlete had more positive attitudes toward the brand endorsed by the athlete. © The Author(s) 2019.","athlete activism; athlete endorsement; attitude; framing; news media",,,,,,,,,"Agyemang, K., Singer, J.N., DeLorme, J., An exploratory study of black male college athletes’ perceptions on race and athlete activism (2010) International Review for the Sociology of Sport, 45, pp. 419-435; Arpan, L.M., Baker, K., Lee, Y., Jung, T., Lorusso, L., Smith, J., News coverage of social protests and the effects of photographs and prior attitudes (2006) Mass Communication & Society, 9, pp. 1-20; Ashley, L., Olson, B., Constructing reality: Print media’s framing of the women’s movement, 1966 to 1986 (1998) Journalism & Mass Communication Quarterly, 75, pp. 263-277; Badenhausen, K., Kobe Bryant’s sponsorship will rebound (2004) Forbes, , https://www.forbes.com/2004/09/03/cz_kb_0903kobe.html, September, 3, Retrieved from; Boykoff, J., Framing dissent: Mass-media coverage of the global justice movement (2006) New Political Science, 28, pp. 201-228; Brown, K.A., Is apology the best policy?

In-house sites challenge established boundaries between journalism and promotional content, but they seek to engage readers by establishing themselves as credible sources, although judgments about credibility are ultimately up to the audience. This content and textual analysis uses social protest by athletes following comments by President Donald Trump about National Football League (NFL) players in September 2017 as a means of exploring the terms of engagement in team media between site producers and audience. In content produced about the protest, writers for NFL team sites stressed the ideas of unity and collaboration expressed by players and executives. Fan response on Facebook was harshly critical toward the protesting athletes, teams, and NFL. These findings suggest in-house media may amplify messages of social protest, but fans use their power in this space to contest those messages. At the same time, the use of in-house spaces as equivalent to newspaper comment sections further casts team media content as less overtly promotional. © The Author(s) 2019.","activism; boundary work; NFL protest; social media; team media",,,,,,,,,"Abbott, A., (1988) The system of professions: An essay on the division of expert labor, , University of Chicago Press; Anderson, A.A., Yeo, S.K., Brossard, D., Scheufele, D.A., Xenos, M.A., Toxic talk: How online incivility can undermine perceptions of media (2018) International Journal of Public Opinion Research, 30, pp. 156-168; Anderson, C.W., What aggregators do: Towards a networked concept of journalistic expertise in the digital age (2013) Journalism, 14, pp. 1008-1023; Bellamy, R.V., Reflections on communication and sport: On institutions and strategies (2012) Communication and Sport, 1, pp. 43-54; Bolen, E., (2012) Rich Hammond and the evolving role of official team website reporter, , http://www.defendingbigd.com/2012/10/16/3509784/rich-hammond-los-angeles-kings-official-team-website-nhl-lockout-resigned, Retrieved January 11, 2013, from Defending Big D website; Carlson, M., The many boundaries of journalism (2015) Boundaries of Journalism, pp. 1-18. , Carlson M., Lewis S.C., (eds), Oxford University Press, (Eds.), (., –; Coleman, D., (2015) BBWAA letting MLB.com writers is necessary, but a bad sign for the future, , http://www.crawfishboxes.com/2015/12/8/9873272/bbwaa-letting-mlb-com-writers-is-necessary-but-a-bad-sign-for-the, Retrieved March 21, 2016, from The Crawfish Boxes website; Druckman, J.N., On the limits of framing effects: Who can frame?

The findings suggest that in the absence of free and democratic public spaces for negotiation of their rights, Iranian women have increasingly used social media and online campaigns as enabling platforms to partake in a communication discourse, raise awareness, practice democracy, mobilize masses, and protest against social injustice. © The Author(s) 2019.","gender oppression; Iranian female fans; resistance in sport; social injustice; social media",,,,,,,,,"Afary, J., Anderson, K., (2005) Foucault and the Iranian revolution: Gender and seduction of Islamism, , The University of Chicago Press; Afshar, H., Women, marriage and the state in Iran (1987) Women, state and ideology: Studies from Africa and Asia, , Afshar H., (ed), Palgrave Macmillan Press, (Ed; Afzali, N., Iranian women campaign to be football spectators (2015) Women’s sport as politics in Muslim contexts, , Hoodfar H., (ed), Women Living Under Muslim Laws, (Ed; Akbarzadeh, S., (2012) Routledge handbook of political Islam, , Routledge, (Ed; Alaei, F., (2019) Undercover: Female footballfans in Iran, , https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2019/apr/15/undercover-female-football-fans-in-iran?CMP=share_btn_tw, Retrieved from; Alexander, H., Vahdat, A., Ghoncheh Ghavami’s imprisonment “nothing to do with volleyball.

His actions prompted national outrage: ultimately calling into question his national identity and patriotism towards the United States. The anthem protest continued throughout the 2016 and through the 2017 season. Consequently, the NFL decided to implement a national anthem policy to discipline players who continued to protest. Thus, this study examined individuals’ perceptions of the NFL’s crisis responsibility in handling the anthem protest and how it affected their reputation. Further, this study examined national identity and patriotism as mediators between crisis responsibility and organizational reputation. Results indicated that national identity did not serve as a mediator and that only one level of patriotism mediated the relationship. A discussion was also forwarded. © The Author(s) 2019.","national identity; NFL anthem protest; organizational reputation; patriotism; situational crisis communication",,,,,,,,,"Bairner, A., Assessing the sociology of sport: On national identity and nationalism (2015) International Review for the Sociology of Sport, 50, pp. 375-379; Beck, P.J., The relevance of the “irrelevant”: Football as a missing dimension in the study of British relations with Germany (2003) International Affairs, 79, pp. 389-411; Billings, A.C., Brown, K.A., Brown, N.A., 5,535 Hours of impact: Effects of Olympic media in nationalism attitudes (2013) Journal of Broadcasting & Electronic Media, 57, pp. 579-595; Borden, J., Effects of national identity in transnational crises: Implication of social identity theory for attribution and crisis communications (2016) International Journal of Communication, 10, pp. 377-397; Breer, A., Despite success internationally, NFL still has a long way to go (2012) NFL.com, , http://www.nfl.com/news/story/09000d5d82317f83/article/despite-success-internationally-nfl-still-has-long-way-to-go, August, 31, Retrieved from; Brown, K.A., Billings, A.C., Schallhorn, C., Schramm, H., Devlin, N.A., Power within the Olympics rings?

The campaign, which would serve as the umbrella under which the NFL’s US$89 million social justice partnership with the players would be housed, launched with its own website, hashtag, commercial, and documentary series. This article textually examines the “Inspire Change” campaign and its associated media materials, contextualizing it against the kneeling protests carried out by Colin Kaepernick and other NFL players as well as the NFL’s reactions to those protests. In doing so, I argue that NFL’s response to its players’ call for social justice is at once a strategic expansion by the league that seeks to capitalize on the emergent activist power of professional players to build the league’s brand as an authoritative and inclusive American institution contributing to social good. At the same time, however, under withering criticism from President Trump and conservative media, it reestablishes league control over the voice of rebellious Black players by subsuming their social justice efforts under the auspices of a campaign that evades the ideological confrontation of the kneeling protests in favor of a more positive, market-friendly version of “justice” based in calls of unity. © The Author(s) 2019.","activism; corporate social responsibility; NFL; protests; social justice",,,,,,,,,"Belson, K., Players criticize N.F.L. over donation proposal (2017) The New York Times, , www.nytimes.com, November, 29; Belson, K., Leibovich, M., Inside the confidential N.F.L. meeting to discuss national anthem protests (2018) The New York Times, , www.nytimes.com, April, 25; Benson, P., Big football: Corporate social responsibility and the culture and color of injury in America’s most popular sport (2017) Journal of Sport and Social Issues, 41, pp. 307-334. , https://doi.org/10.1177/0193723517707699; Blades, L.A., Trump’s obsession with Chicago, explained (2017) Teen Vogue, , www.teenvogue.com/story/trumps-obsession-with-chicago-explained, July, 6; Bliss, J., Titans Derrick Morgan calls NFL’s social justice pledge ‘hush money’ but says it’s also progress (2019) Tennessean, , www.tennessean.com, April, 25; Boren, C., Roger Goodell says fans don’t come to NFL games ‘to be protested to (2017) The Washington Post, , www.washingtonpost.com, November, 9, (,).,.’; Boykoff, J., Carrington, B., Sporting dissent: Colin Kaepernick, NFL activism, and media framing contests (2019) International Review for the Sociology of Sport, pp. 1-21. , https://doi.org/10.1177/1012690219861594; Braga, A.A., Brunson, R.K., (2015) The police and public discourse on “black-on-black” violence, , www.https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/bf2a/e7b2bb4ffefd2e99ecc51cae4b0f97363e94.pdf, National Institute for Justice; Braga, A.A., Brunson, R.K., Drakulich, K.M., Race, place, and effective policing (2019) Annual Review of Sociology, 45, pp. 535-555; Butterworth, M.L., Ritual in the “church of baseball”: Suppressing the discourse of democracy after 9/11 (2005) Communication and Critical/Cultural Studies, 2, pp. 107-129. , https://doi.org/10.1080/14791420500082635; Chiu, A., Keep our name out of your mouth’: Chicago mayor Lore Lightfoot spars with Ted Cruz over gun control (2019) The Washington Post, , www.washingtonpost.com, September, 4, (,). ‘; Cunningham, P.L., Please don’t fine me again!!!!!”: Black athletic defiance in the NBA and NFL (2009) Journal of Sport and Social Issues, 33, pp. 39-58. , https://doi.org/10.1177/0193723508328630; Falcous, M., Hawzen, M.G., Newman, J.I., Hyperpartisan sports media in Trump’s America: The metapolitics of Breitbart Sports (2019) Communication & Sport, 7, pp. 588-610. , https://doi.org/10.1177/2167479518801557; Graham, B.A., Donald Trump blasts NFL anthem protesters: ‘Get that son of a bitch off the field (2017) The Guardian, , www.theguardian.com, September, 23; Hauck, G., Donald Trump is visiting Chicago, a city he’s called a war zone.

This premise was applied to social media commentary within England’s matches against Croatia and Colombia during the 2018 Fédération Internationale de Football Association World Cup, uncovering that English fans tended to perform Basking in Reflected Glory (BIRG) when England was leading or victorious and tended to engage in Cutting Off Reflected Failure (CORF) when England was trailing or defeated. In Method 1, team identification, national identification with England, and sentiment were significantly higher when England was leading or victorious than when they were trailing or defeated. In Method 2, machine learning generated trending graphs to detect that English fans BIRGed when they scored against Colombia; they also BIRGed more frequently during the match with Croatia, peaking several times when they scored a goal, saved a goal, or took a free kick. However, even though CORFing (i.e., lower team identification, lower national identification, and lower sentiment) occurred when the opposing team scored, English fans still BIRGed when they were finally defeated by Croatia, likely a function of the stage the game took place (World Cup semifinal), indicating that England had nonetheless succeeded in the World Cup as a whole. © The Author(s) 2019.","2018 FIFA World Cup; BIRGing; CORFing; machine learning; social identity theory",,,,,,,,,"Atwell Seate, A., Ma, R., Iles, I., McCloskey, T., Parry-Giles, S., ‘This is who we are!’: National identity construction and the 2014 FIFA World Cup (2017) Communication & Sport, 5, pp. 428-447; Bee, C., Madrigal, R., Outcomes are in the eye of the beholder (2012) Journal of Media Psychology, 24, pp. 143-153; Berger, C.R., Communicating under uncertainty (1987) Interpersonal processes: New directions in communication research, pp. 39-62. , Roloff M.E., Miller G.R., (eds), Beverly Hills, CA, Sage, (Eds.), (., –; Billings, A.C., Brown, K.A., Brown, N.A., 5,535 hours of impact: Effects of Olympic media on nationalism attitudes (2013) Journal of Broadcasting & Electronic Media, 57, pp. 579-595; Billings, A.C., Brown, N.A., Brown, K.A., Guoqing, M.A., Ličen, S., From pride to smugness and the nationalism between: Olympic media consumption effects on nationalism across the globe (2013) Mass Communication and Society, 16, pp. 910-932. , …; Billings, A.C., Burch, L.M., Zimmerman, M.H., Fragments of us, fragments of them: Social media, nationality and US perceptions of the 2014 FIFA World Cup (2015) Soccer & Society, 16, pp. 726-744; Billings, A.C., Devlin, M.B., Brown, K.A., BIRGing with the best; CORFing for the country: Fan identification and nationalism during the 2014 FIFA World Cup (2016) Journal of Global Sport Management, 1, pp. 49-65; Billings, A.C., Brown, K., Brown-Devlin, N., Sports draped in the American flag: Impact of the 2014 Winter Olympic telecast on nationalized attitudes (2015) Mass Communication and Society, 18, pp. 377-398; Bishop, H., Jaworski, A., ‘We beat’em’: Nationalism and the hegemony of homogeneity in the British press reportage of Germany versus England during Euro 2000 (2003) Discourse & Society, 14, pp. 243-271; Boen, F., Vanbeselaere, N., Feys, J., Behavioral consequences of fluctuating group success: An internet study of soccer-team fans (2002) The Journal of social psychology, 142, pp. 769-781; Bollen, J., Mao, H., Zeng, X., Twitter mood predicts the stock market (2011) Journal of computational science, 2, pp. 1-8; Branscombe, N.R., Wann, D.L., Collective self‐esteem consequences of outgroup derogation when a valued social identity is on trial (1994) European Journal of Social Psychology, 24, pp. 641-657; Campbell, R.M., Jr., Aiken, D., Kent, A., Beyond BIRGing and CORFing: Continuing the exploration of fan behavior (2004) Sport Marketing Quarterly, 13; Cialdini, R.B., Borden, R.J., Thorne, A., Walker, M.R., Freeman, S., Sloan, L.R., Basking in reflected glory: Three (football) field studies (1976) Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 34, p. 366; Cohen, D., (2018) What drove discussion during super bowl LII on Twitter, Facebook, YouTube?, , https://www.adweek.com/digital/super-bowl-lii-wrap-twitter-facebook-youtube/, February, 5, Retrieved from; Crabbe, T., Fishing for community: England fans at the 2006 FIFA World Cup (2008) Soccer & Society, 9, pp. 428-438; Cui, G., Wong, M.L., Lui, H.K., Machine learning for direct marketing response models: Bayesian networks with evolutionary programming (2006) Management Science, 52, pp. 597-612; Cunningham, N.R., Eastin, M.S., Second screen and sports: A structural investigation into team identification and efficacy (2017) Communication & Sport, 5, pp. 288-310; Dalakas, V., Madrigal, R., Anderson, K.L., We are number one!

Coupling underlying personality traits to subsequent motivations for team identification provides unique psychographics about the target audience, which may assist marketing professionals by revealing which type of people are drawn to sport, and more importantly, why. College students from three universities were surveyed, and results suggest sport fans’ motivations and team identities both exist due to underlying personality traits, thus advancing sport motivation research while simultaneously examining the role of personality in sport-related behaviors. © The Author(s) 2019.","HEXACO personality inventory;

A key challenge for these foundations is to communicate effectively with their target audiences to obtain support from them. By drawing from the construal-level theory and athlete identification literature, the current study examines the effects of different types of messages (hedonic vs. meaningful) on sport consumers’ supportive behaviors toward an athlete’s charitable foundation as a function of fans’ level of athlete identification. Results indicated that the use of a meaningful message lead to greater degrees of supportive behavior from sport consumers with low levels of athlete identification than on- and off-field hedonic messages. In contrast, among highly identified sport consumers, both hedonic and meaningful messages elicited greater support for an athlete-owned foundation. © The Author(s) 2019.","athlete foundation; construal-level theory; hedonic message; identification; meaningful message",,,,,,,,,"Agerström, J., Björklund, F., Moral concerns are greater for temporally distant events and are moderated by value strength (2009) Social Cognition, 27, pp. 261-282; Babiak, K., Mills, B., Tainsky, S., Juravich, M., An investigation into professional athlete philanthropy: Why charity is part of the game (2012) Journal of Sport Management, 26, pp. 159-176; Bailey, E., Wojdynski, B.W., Effects of “meaningful” entertainment on altruistic behavior: Investigating potential mediators (2015) Journal of Broadcasting & Electronic Media, 59, pp. 603-619; Bartsch, A., Hartmann, T., The role of cognitive and affective challenge in entertainment experience (2017) Communication Research, 44, pp. 29-53; Becker-Olsen, K.L., Cudmore, B.A., Hill, R.P., The impact of perceived corporate social responsibility on consumer behavior (2006) Journal of Business Research, 59, pp. 46-53; Brown, E., Ferris, J.M., Social capital and philanthropy: An analysis of the impact of social capital on individual giving and volunteering (2007) Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector Quarterly, 36, pp. 85-99; Brown-Devlin, N., Devlin, M.B., Vaughan, P.W., Why fans act that way: Using individual personality to predict BIRGing and CORFing behaviors (2018) Communication & Sport, 6, pp. 395-417; Cunningham, N.R., Eastin, M.S., Second screen and sports: A structural investigation into team identification and efficacy (2017) Communication & Sport, 5, pp. 288-310; Devlin, M., Sheehan, K., A “Crucial Catch” examining responses to NFL teams’ corporate social responsibility messaging on Facebook (2018) Communication & Sport, 6, pp. 474-498; Eyal, T., Liberman, N., Morality and psychological distance: A construal level theory perspective (2012) The social psychology of morality: Exploring the causes of good and evil, pp. 185-202. , Mikulincer M., Shaver P.R., (eds), Washington, DC, American Psychological Association, (Eds.), (., –; Eyal, T., Liberman, N., Trope, Y., Judging near and distant virtue and vice (2008) Journal of Experimental Social Psychology, 44, pp. 1204-1209; Haidt, J., The positive emotion on elevation (2000) Prevention and Treatment, 3, pp. 1-5; Haidt, J., Elevation and the positive psychology of morality (2003) Flourishing: Positive psychology and the life well-lived, pp. 275-289. , Keyes C.L.M., Haidt J., (eds), Washington, DC, American Psychological Association, (Eds.), (., –; Hayes, A.F., (2013) An introduction to mediation, moderation, and conditional process analysis: A regression-based approach, , New York, NY, Guilford Press; Hirschman, E.C., Holbrook, M.B., Hedonic consumption: Emerging concepts, methods and propositions (1982) Journal of Marketing, 46, pp. 92-101; Jang, W., Wann, D.L., Ko, Y.J., Influence of team identification, game outcome, and game process on sport consumers’ happiness (2018) Sport Management Review, 21, pp. 63-71; Janicke, S.H., Oliver, M.B., The relationship between elevation, connectedness, and compassionate love in meaningful films (2017) Psychology of Popular Media Culture, 6, pp. 274-289; Keaton, S.A., Gearhart, C.C., Identity formation, identity strength, and self-categorization as predictors of affective and psychological outcomes: A model reflecting sport team fans’ responses to highlights and lowlights of a college football season (2014) Communication & Sport, 2, pp. 363-385; Kees, J., Berry, C., Burton, S., Sheehan, K., An analysis of data quality: Professional panels, student subject pools, and Amazon’s Mechanical Turk (2017) Journal of Advertising, 46, pp. 141-155; Kempf, D.S., Attitude formation from product trial: Distinct roles of cognition and affect for hedonic and functional products (1999) Psychology & Marketing, 16, pp. 35-50; Kim, J.W., James, J.D., Kim, Y.K., A model of the relationship among sport consumer motives, spectator commitment, and behavioral intentions (2013) Sport Management Review, 16, pp. 173-185; Kim, M., Walker, M., The influence of professional athlete philanthropy on donation intentions (2013) European Sport Management Quarterly, 13, pp. 579-601; Kim, Y.K., Trail, G., Constraints and motivators: A new model to explain sport consumer behavior (2010) Journal of Sport Management, 24, pp. 190-210; Krämer, N., Eimler, S.C., Neubaum, G., Winter, S., Rösner, L., Oliver, M.B., Broadcasting one world: How watching online videos can elicit elevation and reduce stereotypes (2016) New Media & Society, 19, pp. 1349-1368; Kwak, D.H., Kwon, Y., Can an organization’s philanthropic donations encourage consumers to give?

However, under certain circumstances, it is apparent that the typically gendered media conventions may shift to accommodate nationally important sportswomen. This study concerns the British tennis player Virginia Wade, and via a textual analysis, the print-media discourse surrounding her 1977 Wimbledon triumph is analyzed. It is argued that the wider sociohistorical and personal contexts of her victory helped facilitate a shift, whereby her national identity rather than her gender becoming the primary media frame. Not only was Wade’s win considered significant amidst the mid-1970s economic downturn in Britain, it also coincided with Wimbledon’s centenary and a visit by the Queen during jubilee year. Consequently, her victory was imbued with national symbolism through displays of “banal nationalism.” Coupled with Wimbledon’s “invented traditions,” Wade was represented as embodying the British “imagined community” through her play and approach. This study’s findings reassert the importance of examining the intersections of gender and national identity in sport media and urges for more research that foregrounds historical context as a key factor for female athlete national transcendence. © The Author(s) 2019.","British identity; gender; print media; tennis; textual analysis",,,,,,,,,"Anderson, B., (1991) Imagined communities: Reflections on the origin and spread of nationalism, , New York, Verso; Atkin, R., The day Virginia became the Queen of Wimbledon (1977) Tennis Today, pp. 10-13. , August; Bairner, A., Sports development, nations and nationalism (2011) Routledge handbook of sports development, pp. 31-41. , Houlihan B., Green M., (eds), London, England, Routledge, (Eds.), (., –; Bairner, A., Assessing the sociology of sport: On nationalism and national identity (2015) International Review for the Sociology of Sport, 50, pp. 375-379; Ballantine, J., The 16 survivors are singles out (1977) The Sunday Times, p. 31. , June, 26, (,)., p; Barkow, A., The Americanization of Ginny (1978) Tennis USA, 41, pp. 18-21; Bédarida, F., (1979) A social history of England 1851-1975, , London, England, Methuen; Beddington, J., Weatherley, K., Wimbledon ‘77 (1977) S.A.

To achieve this goal, we conducted an exploratory content analysis of 284 English-language articles from 2013 to 2016 using Iyengar’s (1991) thematic and episodic frames and Semetko and Valkenburg’s (2000) five generic news frames. Results indicate that coverage of SDP is often episodically framed, attributed to wire reports rather than individuals, and emphasizes responsibility and human interest. These frames may provide limited understanding of SDP issues in the general public and show that sport journalists still need to embrace their role as sport journalists for good. Recommendations are made for journalists covering this topic globally. © The Author(s) 2019.","framing; journalism; professionalism; sport for development and peace; sport for peace",,,,,,,,,"Aalberg, T., Curran, J., (2012) How media inform democracy: A comparative approach, , New York, NY, Routledge; Aaroe, L., Investigating frame strength: The case of episodic and thematic frames (2011) Political Communication, 28, pp. 207-226; Aday, S., The framesetting effect of news: An experimental test of advocacy versus objectivist frames (2006) Journalism & Mass Communication Quarterly, 83, pp. 767-784; An, S.K., Gower, K.K., How do the news media frame crises?

An experiment was conducted to examine the impact of racialized “brawn” and “brain” frames on perceptions of student-athletes among their potential peers. College student participants (N = 232) were exposed to one of eight versions of a news article about a college football recruit that manipulated the athlete’s race (White vs. Black) and the frame used to describe him (brawn vs. brain vs. mixed vs. control). Results showed a college admittance essay was evaluated more positively when the author was a Black athlete compared to a White athlete. In addition, the brawn frame elicited lower levels of social attraction and greater athlete stereotype endorsement compared to all other frames. No interaction effects were revealed. These findings suggest that how the media frame student-athletes affects expectations of their academic performance, which has practical implications for interpersonal dynamics between student-athletes and their peers, as well as public perceptions of student-athletes writ large. © The Author(s) 2019.","framing theory; race; sports media; student-athletes",,,,,,,"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: The Robert H.

A three-wave field study measured mood, group affiliation, and self-esteem among 174 students at two different universities, immediately before and on 2 consecutive days after the football teams of these universities played in a much anticipated game. Both self-esteem and mood were affected 2 days after the game; however, fans of the winning team showed increased self-esteem (with no related mood improvement) while fans of the defeated team showed decreases in mood (with no related self-esteem deflation). Both the game outcome and the social viewing context influenced self-esteem. Impacts on self-esteem were mediated by both mood and group affiliation changes. © The Author(s) 2019.","college football; college students; mood; self-esteem; social identity",,,,,,"Ohio State University, OSU","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This project was funded through the lead author's research funds at The Ohio State University.",,"Abouserie, R., Sources and levels of stress in relation to locus of control and self esteem in university students (1994) Educational Psychology, 14, pp. 323-330; Abrams, D., Hogg, M.A., Comments on the motivational status of self-esteem in social identity and intergroup discrimination (1988) European Journal of Social Psychology, 18, pp. 317-334; Andriessen, K., Krysinska, K., Can sports events affect suicidal behavior?

The present study examines how consumer evaluations of endorsed brands are influenced by a brand’s response to an endorser scandal. A 2 (brand response strategy type: maintenance vs. termination) × 2 (endorser scandal type: competence-relevant vs. competence-irrelevant) between-subjects experiment is conducted. Specifically, the authors focus on the perceived appropriateness of the response strategy and consumer attitudes toward an endorsed brand. Subjects were recruited from Amazon Mechanical Turk (N = 111). Consumers perceive that terminating an endorsement contract with a scandalized endorser is more appropriate than maintaining the relationship. This is particularly true when celebrity endorsers are involved in competence-relevant scandals. A further analysis provided support for the idea that perceived “appropriateness” mediates the relationship between competence-relevant scandal and consumer attitude toward an endorsed brand.

Resisting traditionally unknown, excluded, or falsely simplified Asian male subjects under a dominant White-centered Western gaze, this study aims to demonstrate relationally and mutationally constructed masculinities in complex cross-racial/ethnic interactions. Given that South Korea is a place in which gender, race, sexuality, and nationality are dynamically shaped by the country’s colonial history and national desire for a global visibility, I focused on this context and analyzed its media texts from online news articles and the following readers’ comments, considering the interactive features in today’s news consumption. As diverse morphologies among men of color demonstrated, this study contends that racial and gendered meanings are constructed according to particular conditions and connectivities; thus, there is no fixed hegemonic masculinity in men’s relations. © The Author(s) 2019.","Asian; Korean; masculinities; media; MLB",,,,,,,,,"Adelman, M.L., (1986) A sporting time: New York city and the rise of modern athletics, 1820–70, , Urbana, University of Illinois Press; Anderson, B., (1983) Imagined communities: Reflections on the origin and spread of nationalism, , London, England, Verso; Avery, D., Why are there no openly gay players in major league baseball?

Without this knowledge, an organization will likely be disconnected from the needs of the public. Inspired by the key constructs in the integrated crisis mapping model, this study examined emotion, coping, and responsibility attribution through a content analysis of tweets during the Larry Nassar scandal involving Michigan State University and USA Gymnastics. This study analyzed a sample of 3,088 tweets generated by the public several days following the sentencing of Larry Nassar. The findings had both theoretical and practical implications. Theoretically, the findings provided an extension of emotions examined and suggested ways in which the model could be expanded to accommodate varied crisis situations. Furthermore, the study revealed important findings regarding levels of attributions and the relationship of the public’s emotions and attribution of responsibilities. On a practical level, the findings offered tangible suggestions for sports communication managers when developing appropriate strategies and tactics considering public sentiments such as emotions, coping strategies, and attributions on social media. © The Author(s) 2019.","attribution; coping strategy; crisis communication; emotion; social media; sports communication",,,,,,,,,"An, S.-K., Gower, K.K., How do the news media frame crises?

Empirical evidence of its effectiveness, however, has been limited to athlete affect and based on data from retrospective samples of former high school athletes. This study addresses these limitations by exploring the effectiveness of coaches’ use of confirmation with collegiate student-athletes and considers its influence on their satisfaction with coaches and sport, competitiveness, and cognitive learning. Data obtained from 177 Division-I student-athletes revealed that coaches’ use of challenge increases student-athletes’ satisfaction, motivation, competitiveness, and learning, whereas the use of acceptance only determines satisfaction. These findings demonstrate that confirmation is an effective coaching behavior, its dimensions function independently, and challenge best fulfills the multidimensional nature of coaching effectiveness. The implications of this data reveal that confirmation theory functions uniquely within the athletic context, and coach effectiveness is largely determined by the implementation of strategies and efforts to refine skill sets and assist in development. © The Author(s) 2019.","athlete learning;

Her outing elicited fervent responses from the MMA community, reflecting the barriers many transgender women encounter in sex-segregated sports. Fox frequently faced pseudoscientific arguments alleging innate physical advantages over cisgender women, which are deeply entangled with sexist and racist assumptions about trans identity. For Fox, the only way to prove her “true” womanhood—that is, that she was just as biologically inferior to men as “regular” women—was by losing fights. In this article, we trouble Fox’s “damned-if-she-wins” and “damned-if-she-doesn’t” conundrum by drawing on Halberstam and Muñoz’s theorizing on the queer art of failure. In order to challenge binary logics that structure our sporting world—including male/female, winning/losing, success/failure—and that are specifically imposed upon transgender athletes such as Fox, we employ a queer methodology to center Fox’s voice as she grapples with the meanings and uses of failure. Her insights reveal a productive engagement with athletic failure, which not only challenges sex segregation in sports and the interlocking discourses of racism, (cis)sexism, and transphobia, but allows us to imagine queer modes of undoing beyond the athletic realm of the MMA cage. © The Author(s) 2019.","Fallon Fox; mixed-martial arts; queer art of failure; sex segregation in sports; transgender athletes",,,,,,,,,"(2012) ABC medical recommendations/guidelines for the improvement of the health and safety of combat sports participants, , https://www.transathlete.com/policies-by-organization, July, Retrieved from; Billings, A.C., Moscowitz, L., (2018) Media and the coming out of gay male athletes in American team sports, , New York, NY, Peter Lang; Bissell, T., Openly gay fighter Amanda Nunes wins UFC bantamweight championship (2016) Outsports, , http://www.outsports.com/2016/7/10/12141714/openly-gay-fighter-amanda-nunes-wins-ufc-batamweight-championship, July, 10, Retrieved from; Boellstorff, T., Queer studies under ethnography’s sign (2006) GLQ: A Journal of Lesbian and Gay Studies, 12, pp. 627-639; Carrington, B., (2010) Race, sport and politics: The sporting black diaspora, , London, England, Sage; Collins, P.H., (2004) Black sexual politics: African Americans, gender, and the new racism, , New York, NY, Routledge; Cooky, C., Dycus, R., Dworkin, S.L., What makes a woman a woman?” versus “our first lady of sport”: A comparative analysis of the United States and the South African media coverage of Caster Semenya (2013) Journal of Sport and Social Issues, 37, pp. 31-56; (2015) Fallon Fox: The first openly transgender fighter in MMA, , http://elitedaily.com/sports/fallon-fox-became-first-openly-transgender-fighter-mma-video/1143650/, July, 28, [Video].

One of the most striking changes is the introduction of “second screens” that accompany viewing. The current study adds to the existing research literature by examining viewing patterns and socialization during the live broadcast of major sports games. Specifically, it examines the use of smartphones and WhatsApp among Israeli viewers of the 2018 World Cup games’ televised broadcasts, from the quarterfinals onward. In total, 454 respondents were filtered through a screening question, in a representative panel of Israeli population. Findings show that most viewers prefer to watch the broadcast of a major soccer game together, though co-viewing is not necessarily done in the physical presence of others. Findings also reveal a connection between the viewer’s engagement with the game and the enjoyment of watching the broadcast. Further, this relationship is mediated through the use of a smartphone as a second screen, especially the use of WhatsApp. This study contributes to existing research literature by showing the extent to which game-related communication using WhatsApp contributes to a meaningful collaborative viewing experience, the degree of engagement with the game, and the extent to which it is enjoyed. © The Author(s) 2019.","engagement; second screen; social television; WhatsApp; World Cup",,,,,,,,,"Appel, M., Gnambs, T., Richter, T., Green, M.C., The transportation scale–short form (TS–SF) (2015) Media Psychology, 18, pp. 243-266; Bilandzic, H., Busselle, R.W., Transportation and transportability in the cultivation of genre-consistent attitudes and estimates (2008) Journal of Communication, 58, pp. 508-529; Billings, A.C., Qiao, F., Conlin, L., Nie, T., Permanently desiring the temporary?

This event was a catalyst for discussion into how the media cover intimate partner violence (IPV) committed by National Football League (NFL) players. Media frames can shape the way audiences make sense of an issue. As the “Worldwide Leader in Sports,” Entertainment and Sports Programming Network (ESPN) has a journalistic responsibility to frame and address sociocultural issues related to sports, especially those involving crime, health, and safety. IPV is a pervasive sociocultural issue affecting millions of people in the United States, and media frames can shape the way audiences understand the subject matter and the themes surrounding IPV. This research used qualitative textual analysis to examine ESPN’s website coverage of IPV incidents committed by NFL players 2 years prior to and after the Ray Rice incident. Our findings show that instances of IPV were more episodically than thematically framed before the Ray Rice incident. Framing of IPV was revealed in four themes: focus on the individual player, problem for the team, the NFL’s problem, and missing the point. Further analysis and theoretical and practical implications are discussed. © The Author(s) 2018.","ESPN; intimate partner violence (IPV); media framing; NFL; sports media",,,,,,,,,"Abramson, K., Keefe, B., Chou, W., Communicating about cancer through Facebook: A qualitative analysis of a breast cancer awareness page (2014) Journal of Health Communication, 20, pp. 1-7; Aden, R.C., Borchers, T.A., Grim Buxbaum, A., Cronn-Mills, K., Davis, S., Dollar, N.J., Communities of cornhuskers: The generation of place through sports fans’ rituals (2009) Qualitative Research Reports in Communication, 10, pp. 26-37. , …; Altheide, D.L., (1996) Qualitative media analysis, , Thousand Oaks, CA, Sage; Barshop, S., (2014) 15 NFL players arrested for violence against women in the last two years, , http://www.si.com/nfl/2014/09/11/nfl-players-arrested-domestic-violence-assault, Retrieved from; Beaver, W., The future of football (2013) Society, 50, pp. 335-338; Billings, A., Depicting the quarterback in black and white: A content analysis of college and professional football broadcast commentary (2004) Howard Journal of Communications, 15, pp. 201-210; Bullock, C.F., Cubert, J., Coverage of domestic violence fatalities by newspapers in Washington state (2002) Journal of Interpersonal Violence, 17, pp. 475-499; Campbell, A., Wallace, G., Black megachurch websites: An assessment of health content for congregations and communities (2015) Health Communication, 30, pp. 1-9; Carll, E., News portrayal of violence and women: Implications for public policy (2003) The American Behavioral Scientist, 46, pp. 1601-1610; Carlyle, K.E., Orr, C., Savage, M., Babin, E., News coverage of intimate partner violence: Impact on prosocial responses (2014) Media Psychology, 17, pp. 451-471; Carlyle, K.E., Slater, M.D., Chakroff, J.L., Newspaper coverage of intimate partner violence: Skewing representations of risk (2008) Journal of Communication, 58, pp. 168-186; (2017) Preventing intimate partner violence, , https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/pdf/ipv-factsheet.pdf, Retrieved from; Chase, C., (2014) Steven A.

The sport is cited as one that fosters a number of intangible benefits but is increasingly mentioned as dangerous for youth participants. This study employed a sensemaking theory framework to explore the family, community, and media dynamics that influence how parents made sense of their football decisions. We interviewed 12 married couples about their decisions allowing their child to play middle school football. Results indicate parents were affected by family identities, community and social influences, and information sources in their football decisions. We developed a typology describing three parental approaches to the football decision: the football-first family, the safety-first family, and the laissez-faire family. We drew connections between family type, decision agency, and risk assessment for the pro-football decision. To conclude, we offer theoretical and practical implications related to this key parental decision. © The Author(s) 2018.","family identity; parental decision-making; risk assessment; sensemaking theory; tackle football",,,,,,,,,"Anderson, E., Kian, E.M., Examining media contestation of masculinity and head trauma in the National Football League (2012) Men and Masculinities, 15, pp. 152-173; Armstrong, K., With increasing knowledge of CTE, parents are now faced with tough decisions when it comes to youth football (2017) New York Daily News, , http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/football/parents-faced-tough-decisions-football-article-1.3615533, November 7, Retrieved from; Auerbach, P.S., How to save football players’ brains (2018) The Wall Street Journal, p.

Most of these products feature in-play betting, that is, the ability to bet on a game once it has started while watching it. In-play betting has raised many concerns among responsible gambling advocates due to its perceived relationship with problem gambling behaviour. This study explored the association between in-play betting and problem gambling. More specifically, the study examined how motives for consuming sport and how involved sports fans were in watching sport affected their gambling. Also, adjacent risk behaviours to in-play betting (such as consuming junk food and alcohol) during live sports betting were examined. Using a survey comprising 659 sports bettors from Spain, the study found that compared to participants not engaging in in-play betting, in-play bettors reported higher (i) problem gambling severity, (ii) sport watching involvement, (iii) consumption of sport to escape from everyday preoccupations, and (iv) consumption of junk food and/or alcohol while watching sport. These findings make the case that in-play betting regulators and providers should be cognizant of the interplay of sport-specific, media-related, and other risks, involved in the act of in-play betting while watching live sport. © The Author(s) 2018.","gambling; in-play betting; problem gambling; sport watching; sports betting",,,,,,"Institute of Infection and Immunity, III

This trend also has integrated into youth baseball through statistical applications that digitally capture and evaluate player performance. This essay examines the influence of baseball stat-tracking app GameChanger in the context of Little League Baseball and how it positions players, parents, and coaches to understand responsible citizenship through neoliberal risk management. The essay considers how risk management quantification and its accompanying development of responsible citizenship through GameChanger impact each of these stakeholder groups. As statistical evaluation becomes more commonplace in Little League Baseball, it shifts the Little League Experience into a more quantified, risk-management enterprise. In doing so, the experience becomes altered by enhancing opportunities for those players whom data suggest possess the maximum utility for production. © The Author(s) 2018.","data analytics; Little League; neoliberalism; sport and data; youth sports",,,,,,,,,"Aarseth, H., A solid foundation?

The current study explored the perceptions of football recruiting reporters with respect to their ethical responsibilities and the issues they face in their jobs. In doing so, the study builds on the work of Yanity and Edmondson, who explored the perceptions of journalists from other fields about ethical dilemmas they perceived as relevant in the budding high school football recruiting media industry. Through analysis of interviews with 15 people who have worked as reporters for major recruiting websites such as Rivals.com or 247Sports.com, we contend that several key ethical issues must be addressed by online college football and basketball recruiting outlets to protect athletes and to promote responsible journalism. These issues include (a) incessant contact of high school athletes by media members; (b) lack of institutional oversight by parent companies over school-specific sites; (c) ambiguous methodology behind player evaluation; (d) conflicts of interest inherent in recruiting media outlets hosting evaluation camps; and (e) lack of institutional protection from unethical pressures by members of college athletic departments. © The Author(s) 2020.","college; football; media; recruiting; scouting",,,,,,,,,"(2017) Release: CBS sports digital to acquire Scout media, , https://247sports.com/Bolt/Release-CBS-Sports-Digital-To-Acquire-Scout-Media-51033804, February, 1, 247sports.com; Abernathy, P.M., (2018) The loss of newspapers and readers, , https://www.usnewsdeserts.com/reports/expanding-news-desert/loss-of-local-news/loss-newspapers-readers/, News deserts, Retrieved May 6, 2019, from; Auchard, E., (2007) Yahoo acquires U.S. sports media site Rivals.com, , https://www.reuters.com/article/us-yahoo-sports-idUSN2031128220070621, June, 21, Retrieved April 30, 2019, from; Baker, C.E., (2006) Media concentration and democracy: Why ownership matters, , Cambridge University Press; Baysinger, T., (2017) In volatile sports media landscape, Bleacher Report sees path to relevance, , https://www.reuters.com/article/us-time-warner-bleacherreport/in-volatile-sports-media-landscape-bleacher-report-sees-path-to-relevance-idUSKBN17S2J4, April, 26, Retrieved May 6, 2019, from; Bennett, G., Building a strong new media brand: The case of TexAgs.com (2017) Sport Marketing Quarterly, 26 (3), pp. 153-167; Bergman, S.A., Logan, T.D., The effect of recruit quality on college football team performance (2016) Journal of Sports Economics, 17 (6), pp. 578-600. , https://doi.org/10.1177/1527002514538266; Boclair, D., (2017) Shannon Terry’s passion play, , https://www.nashvillepost.com/business/nashville-post-magazine/article/20862877/shannon-terrys-passion-play, May, 19, Retrieved June 5, 2020, from; Boylan, C., McMahon, R., Monroe, B.L., (2016) Racially differentiated language in NFL scouting reports, , Paper presentation, The ACM SIGKDD ‘16 workshop on large scale sports analytics, San Francisco, CA, United States, [,]; Caro, C.A., College football success: The relationship between recruiting and winning (2012) International Journal of Sports Science & Coaching, 7 (1), pp. 139-152. , https://doi.org/10.1260/1747-9541.7.1.139; Charmaz, K., Qualitative interviewing and grounded theory analysis (2003) Inside interviewing: New lenses, new concerns, pp. 311-330. , Holstein J.A., Gubrium J.F., (eds), Sage, (Eds.), (., –; Charmaz, K., (2014) Constructing grounded theory, , 2nd ed, Sage; Downie, L., Schudson, M., The reconstruction of American journalism (2009) Columbia Journalism Review, , https://archives.cjr.org/reconstruction/; Draper, K., (2018) At the Athletic, a hiring spree becomes a story in itself, , https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/24/sports/the-athletic-netflix.html, August, 24, Retrieved May 6, 2019, from; Dumond, J.M., Lynch, A.K., Platania, J., An economic model of the college football recruiting process (2008) Journal of Sports Economics, 9 (1), pp. 67-87. , https://doi.org/10.1177/1527002506298125; Fenton, N., Deregulation or democracy?

Therefore, to accurately paint a picture of The Athletic’s perceived impact on print journalism, 22 in-depth interviews were conducted with newspaper sports editors. This analysis reveals that most sports editors were generally accepting of The Athletic and viewed its presence as reinforcement that newspapers need to stick to daily coverage to stand out in the crowded sports media marketplace. © The Author(s) 2020.","The Athletic; gatekeeping; new media; qualitative; sports journalism",,,,,,,,,"Adler, L., ‘The Athletic’ is coming for your local baseball beat writer (2018) Deadspin, , http://www.deadspin.com/the-athletic-is-coming-for-your-local-baseball-beat-wri-1822157600, January, 18; Yale office of career strategy, , http://www.ocs.yale.edu/career-resource/associated-press-sports-editors; Bauder, D., Lieb, D.A., Decline in readers, ads leads hundreds of newspapers to fold (2019) Associated Press, , http://www.apnews.com/0c59cf4a09114238af55fe18e32bc454, March, 11; Boudway, I., The sports news site haters love to dunk on keeps signing up subscribers (2019) Bloomberg Businessweek, , http://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2019-08-20/an-upstart-sports-news-service-is-thriving-amid-media-layoffs, August, 20; Boyle, R., Sports journalism: Changing journalism practice and digital media (2017) Digital Journalism, 5 (5), pp. 493-495; Bucholtz, A., The athletic lays off 46 people, almost eight percent of its staff (2020) Awful Announcing, , http://www.awfulannouncing.com/athletic/the-athletic-lays-off-46-people.html, June, 5; Butterworth, M.L., (2010) Baseball and rhetorics of purity: The national pastime and American identity during the war on terror, , University of Alabama Press; Cassidy, W.P., Inching away from the toy department: Daily newspaper sports coverage of Jason Collins’ and Michael Sam’s coming out (2017) Communication & Sport, 5 (5), pp. 534-553; Chang, T.K., Lee, J.W., Factors affecting gatekeepers’ selection of foreign news: A national survey of newspaper editors (1992) Journalism Quarterly, 69 (3), pp. 554-561; Chyi, H.I., Paying for what?

A randomized experiment of 600 parents whose children play football in middle school or high school were presented with one of the five narrative conditions or the control condition (where parents read a brochure). Results indicate that parents who read the narrative shared from the perspective of a high school football player, a parent, a coach, and a Center for Disease Control and Prevention researcher induced negative emotions, and those exposed to the narratives from the perspective of a high school football player and a parent also experienced a sense of identification and thereby reduced counterargument. Negative emotions and a reduced counterargument influenced intentions of these parents to inform their children of the dangers and risks of playing football and prompted them to read information on sports-related concussions.

Given the evolving forms of smart technologies blurring the boundaries between the actual and mediated domains of sports, an approach that grapples with the broad sociotechnical dynamics within and around sport is necessary. Drawing from critical studies on big data, innovation, and smart cities, this study adopts a sociotechnical perspective to approach Arizona State University’s Sun Devil Stadium, known as one of the first smart stadiums in the United States. This study examines how the smart stadium employs a range of techniques and technologies to engage with and influence broader sociocultural themes in society: the prevalent imperative of innovation and the hyperdigitalization of sport through which bodies in space are becoming knowable and governable in new ways. We conclude that the smart stadium, articulated both literally and figuratively as a “living laboratory of innovation,” appropriates sport as a useful motif to affect broader cultural debates around big data and spatializes new techniques of social ordering through a parametric and processual definition of normalcy. © The Author(s) 2020.","datafication; fan normalization; innovation; laboratory; smart stadium",,,,,,,,,"Andrejevic, M., Burdon, M., Defining the sensor society (2015) Television & New Media, 16 (1), pp. 19-36; (2017) Global sport alliance will explore topics including diversity and race, sustainability and human potential through sport, , https://asunow.asu.edu/20170612-asu-news-adidas-global-partnership-shape-future-sport, June, 12; Baade, R.A., Professional sports as catalysts for metropolitan economic development (1996) Journal of Urban Affairs, 18 (1), pp. 1-17; Bale, J., (2003) Sports geography, , 2nd ed, Routledge; Billings, A.C., Hardin, M., (2014) Routledge handbook of sport and new media, , Routledge, (Eds; Borowy, M., Jin, D.Y., Pioneering e-sport: The experience economy and the marketing of early 1980s arcade gaming contests (2013) International Journal of Communication, 7, pp. 2254-2274; Boyle, R., Mobile communication and the sports industry: The case of 3G (2004) Trends in Communication, 12 (2), pp. 73-82; Brennan, J., Broek, S., Durazzi, N., Kamphuis, B., Ranga, M., Ryan, S., (2014) Study on innovation in higher education: Final report, , European commission directorate for education and training study on innovation higher education.

The extent to which the esports fans’ basic psychological needs—that is, competence, autonomy, and relatedness—are satisfied were assessed by using a composite latent variable model. Findings derived from the data analyses confirmed the relevance of the SDT in explaining pertinent information on need satisfaction, motivation, and related consumption behaviors. In particular, relatedness was identified as the most salient basic psychological need dimension, suggesting that satisfying this need is critically important for esports consumption. Both the inquiry protocol and the findings of this investigation contribute to the existing literature on motivation by developing an SDT model in esports media studies. Further discussions were made on deciphering the opportunities and challenges associated with the burgeoning esports industry. © The Author(s) 2020.","esports; formative measurement model; innate needs; motivation; SDT",,,,,,,,,"Alexandris, K., Zahariadis, P., Tsorbatzoudis, C., Grouios, G., Testing the sport commitment model in the context of exercise and fitness participation (2002) Journal of Sport Behavior, 25 (3), pp. 217-230; Anderson, E.W., Customer satisfaction and word of mouth (1998) Journal of Service Research, 1 (1), pp. 5-17; Angelis, M.D., Bonezzi, A., Peluso, A.M., Rucker, D.D., Costabile, M., On braggarts and gossips: A self-enhancement account of word-of-mouth generation and transmission (2012) Journal of Marketing Research, 49 (4), pp. 551-563; Armitage, C.J., Conner, M., Efficacy of the theory of planned behaviour: A meta-analytic review (2001) British Journal of Social Psychology, 40 (4), pp. 471-499; Biscaia, R., Correia, A., Rosado, A.F., Ross, S.D., Maroco, J., Sport sponsorship: The relationship between team loyalty, sponsorship awareness, attitude toward the sponsor, and purchase intentions (2013) Journal of Sport Management, 27 (4), pp. 288-302; Bono, J.E., Judge, T.A., Self-concordance at work: Toward understanding the motivational effects of transformational leaders (2003) Academy of Management Journal, 46 (5), pp. 554-571; Brown, T.J., Barry, T.E., Dacin, P.A., Gunst, R.F., Spreading the word: Investigating antecedents of consumers’ positive word-of-mouth intentions and behaviors in a retailing context (2005) Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science, 33 (2), pp. 123-138; Byrne, S., (2019) Twitch’s head of esports on the trends driving viewer engagement.

Although streetball operates as a Black cultural repertoire constituted in response to historical marginalization, I demonstrate how representations of streetball in mainstream media are underpinned by, and thus reify, harmful racial logics that circulate throughout even purportedly innocuous forms of popular culture in the “colorblind” neoliberal moment. Through a textual analysis of three of the most culturally renowned media representations of streetball—the television show AND1 Mixtape Tour, the video game series NBA Street, and the film Uncle Drew—I argue that streetball is depicted as illustrative of the perceived pathological and inferior nature of Blackness; romanticized and divorced from the structural contexts of its production; and materially and symbolically exploited by corporate commercial entities. I conclude by reflecting on how mediated commodification often participates in reproducing, trivializing, and concealing the effects of structural racism and suggest that critical analyses of the politics of popular culture must inform anti-racist objectives. © The Author(s) 2020.","Black culture; Black expressivity; racial representation; sports media; street basketball",,,,,,,,,"Anderson, L., Millman, C., (1998) Pickup artists: Street basketball in America, , Verso; Andrews, D.L., Excavating Michael Jordan: Notes on a critical pedagogy of sporting representation (1998) Sport and postmodern times, pp. 185-220. , Rail G., (ed), State University of New York Press, (Ed.), (., –; Andrews, D.L., (2019) Making sport great again: The uber-sport assemblage, neoliberalism, and the Trump conjuncture, , Palgrave Macmillan; Andrews, D.L., Silk, M., Basketball’s ghettocentric logic (2010) American Behavioral Scientist, 53 (11), pp. 1626-1644; Bhattacharyya, G., (2018) Rethinking racial capitalism: Questions of reproduction and survival, , Rowman & Littlefield International; Billings, A.C., Butterworth, M.L., Turman, P.D., (2018) Communication and sport: Surveying the field, , 3rd ed, Sage; Bonilla-Silva, E., (2014) Racism without racists: Color-blind racism and the persistence of racial inequality in America, , 4th ed, Rowman & Littlefield; Campbell, B., Hot sauce and white chocolate: And1 and ghetto style in basketball (2015) Communication Design, 3 (1), pp. 51-61; Caponi, G.D., (1999) Signifyin(g), sanctifyin’ & slam dunking: A reader in African-American expressive culture, , University of Massachusetts Press, (Ed; Colás, Y., Ball Don’t Lie!” Rasheed Wallace and the politics of protest in the National Basketball Association (2016) Communication & Sport, 4 (2), pp. 123-144; Erk, A., (2016) The And1 mixtape tour brought streetball experience to the masses, , https://www.si.com/nba/2016/07/14/and-1-mixtape-tour-the-professor-dribbling-machine-half-man-half-amazing, Sports Illustrated; Farred, G., (2003) What’s my name?

By way of Major League Baseball (MLB) team subreddits, fans were surveyed and quizzed on their knowledge of a variety of baseball statistics; they were also surveyed regarding how new or old school they are as a fan, as well as their levels of Schwabism and mavenism. Results indicated that MLB team broadcasts placing greater emphasis on modern statistics produce fans who are more accepting of and knowledgeable about advanced statistics. While new-school fans and those high in Schwabism and mavenism were found to be more favorable towards modern statistics, controlling for those attributes strengthened the association between team broadcast and modern statistical acceptance and knowledge.

However, there are also claims that the PG might in fact be counterproductive to the PWD’s rights movement because they might promote the medical model of disability and/or ableism. In this context, we developed a qualitative exploratory study to investigate the legacies of the Rio 2016 PG from the perspective of disability rights activists and people involved in Paralympic sport managerial positions. In this article, we discuss one of the main perceived legacies that the PG fostered PWD’s visibility and a change in society’s perception of PWD. We conducted 24 open in-depth interviews and found that, for our participants, the PG worked as a showcase for PWD who were rarely seen in the media and in public spaces before the Games. This visibility helped to challenge negative stereotypes and stigmas associated with PWD, as well as possibly opening new doors for them. Our interviewees believe that we shouldn’t expect that the PG alone can change people’s perceptions and PWD’s status overnight. They are part of a larger and complex set of actions that are slowly contributing to this process. © The Author(s) 2020.","legacy; Paralympic Games; people with disability; Rio 2016; visibility",,,,,,"CoordenaÃ§Ã£o de AperfeiÃ§oamento de Pessoal de NÃ­vel Superior, CAPES

Results indicate that both measures commonly associated with active audience, and structural theories played a significant role in explaining esports consumption. Specifically, esports gameplay was explained relatively more by structural factors than by individual factors. Different from esports gameplay, esports spectatorship was driven significantly more by individual factors. Preferences, motivations, availability, and access significantly predicted both esports gameplay and spectatorship. Sports fandom and use of interactive features, on the other hand, only predicted esports spectatorship but did not influence gameplay. By employing an integrative approach, this study aids in the development of conceptual framework that will serve to predict esports consumer behavior. © The Author(s) 2020.","active within structures; audience research; esports gameplay; esports spectatorship; sports consumption; survey",,,,,,,,,"Adams, K.L., Devia-Allen, G.L., Moore, M.A., What’s esports?

Traditionally, scholars have focused their efforts on the televised Olympic broadcasts and photojournalism coverage in newspaper and magazines. Scholarship has historically found that female athletes were underrepresented in event coverage and framed along gender stereotypes; however, in more recent Olympic Games, research has shown the news media has provided more equitable coverage between the genders. Yet digital and social media platforms (SMPs) play a significantly larger role in how Olympic broadcasters share content and engage with audiences. Utilizing media framing theory, this study examines how gender is framed on the Olympic Instagram accounts of the two official North American rights holders: the National Broadcasting Corporation (NBC) and the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC). Researchers collected a cross-sectional sample from the 2016 Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, and the 2018 Winter Games in Pyeongchang, South Korea. Results indicate that NBC and CBC were generally equitable in SMP coverage of men’s and women’s athletic achievements. © The Author(s) 2020.","framing; gender; Instagram; Olympics; social media",,,,,,,,,"Angelini, J.R., Billings, A.C., An agenda that sets the frames: Gender, language, and NBC’s Americanized Olympic telecast (2010) Journal of Language and Social Psychology, 29 (3), pp. 363-385; Angelini, J.R., Billings, A.C., MacArthur, P.J., The nationalistic revolution will be televised: The 2010 Vancouver Olympic Games on NBC (2012) International Journal of Sport Communication, 5 (2), pp. 193-209; Angelini, J.R., MacArthur, P.J., Billings, A.C., What’s the gendered story?

In our analysis, we identify the discourses surrounding race and ethnicity that the commentators in televised football draw on and examine how they relate to hegemonic discourses and categorizations in wider Polish society. Our findings show that Polish football commentators draw on transnationally circulating racialized/ethnicized discourses on assumed superior physicality when talking about Black football players and on supposed negative psychological capabilities when talking about White Southern European football players. The findings also show that when talking about non-Polish players and head coaches, the commentators regularly rely on an us-versus-them frame that constructs foreign influences as a threat. © The Author(s) 2020.","discourse; Poland; race/ethnicity; sport media; televised football",,,,,,,,,"Andrews, D.L., The fact(s) of Michael Jordan’s blackness: Excavating a floating racial signifier (1996) Sociology of Sport Journal, 13 (2), pp. 125-158. , https://doi.org/10.1123/ssj.13.2.125; Azzarito, L., Harrison, L., White men can’t jump': Race, gender and natural athleticism (2008) International Review for the Sociology of Sport, 43 (4), pp. 347-364. , https://doi.org/10.1177/1012690208099871, ‘; Bakuła, B., Colonial and postcolonial aspects of Polish borderlands studies: An outline (2014) Teksty Drugie, 1, pp. 96-124. , http://tekstydrugie.pl/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/t2en_2014_1webCOMB.pdf; Balogun, B., Contemporary Polish racism: The development of neo-communism?

Because Australia is not a traditional powerhouse at the Winter Games, how the media portrays home team and foreign athletes is of interest in this summer sport country. Results revealed that overall, non-Australian athletes were covered and mentioned more frequently than Australian athletes. However, results found taxonomical differences in Seven Network’s depiction of Australian and non-Australian athletes’ successes—Australian success was attributed to athletic ability and courage, whereas non-Australians’ success was more frequently linked to intelligence, experience, and consonance. Differences in the attribution of failure by nationality were also found, with Australian’s failures more likely to be characterized by a lack of commitment and luck compared to their non-Australian counterparts. Athletes’ personalities also were described differently, with Australians receiving comments regarding their emotions, while non-Australians received either more neutral comments or had their appearance and body parts described more often.

Using a platform, such as Twitter, offers numerous affordances for network interactions, which result in the shaping of online identities. Gaining insight into how resource mobilization impacts dialog and identity construction of an athlete is essential as sports have the unique ability to reach and influence a broad audience. This article explores how J.J. Watt used resource mobilization on Twitter to aid the Hurricane Harvey relief, and how his identity was socially constructed over a 3-year period. Based on a textual analysis of 2,965 tweets, the results show that Watt was able to use his celebrity status and active involvement to achieve the largest crowdsourced fundraiser in history. Further, Watt’s actions transformed his identity as a football player into a humanitarian. © The Author(s) 2020.","identity; resource mobilization; social media; sport communication; sport in the community",,,,,,,,,"Anagnostopoulos, C., Gillooly, L., Cook, D., Parganas, P., Chadwick, S., Stakeholder communication in 140 characters or less: A study of community sport foundations (2017) International Society for Third-Sector Research, 28, pp. 2224-2250; Atakan-Duman, S., The role of corporate social responsibility in online identity construction: An analysis of Turkey’s banking sector (2014) Public Relations Review, 40 (5), pp. 862-864; Atakan-Duman, S., Pasamehmetoglu, A., Bozaykut-Buk, T., The challenge of constructing a unique online identity through an isomorphic social media presence (2019) International Journal of Communication, 13, pp. 160-180; Babiak, K., Wolfe, R., More than just a game?

With a goal of doing justice to these Indigenous voices (and in this case also their silence), a critical race theory framework was deployed to both listen to and interpret the reasons behind the protests. The data source was online media reports that centered on the perspectives of players and rugby league officials, along with responses to the protests by prominent journalists and politicians via online opinion pieces. The findings indicate that the voices of Indigenous athletes in Australia are important in raising concerns about nationalist rituals and symbols that, by their colonialist nature, subjugate Aboriginal peoples. Importantly, the Indigenous rugby league players were not alone in their campaign. The Recognition in Anthem Project, which began in 2017, indicates that the perspectives of these protesting rugby players were part of a wider discussion about change. The movement for a new national anthem, therefore, was not just isolated to sport, and this appears to have provided the Indigenous rugby players—as social commentators—with atypical influence. © The Author(s) 2020.","activism;

Due to societal stigmas, such a public conversation was once a rarity in the NBA, making their discussion of mental health a worthy area of examination. A media framing analysis of 58 press articles for White and 42 articles for DeRozan revealed six frames for each athlete used to discuss their situation. Despite both being African American athletes playing the same sport, they were covered differently. Analysis discovered that frames for White, a first-year player who wanted changes in the system of how the NBA handled mental health, most commonly focused on him and his specific situation, while frames for DeRozan, an NBA All-Star who positioned himself solely as an advocate, most frequently discussed shedding the stigma of mental health and the increased awareness surrounding the topic. Additionally, while there were frames critical of White, there were no such frames for DeRozan. Still, for both players, this type of coverage humanizes the experience of mental health and leads to important insights about changes in masculinity among athletes. © The Author(s) 2020.","basketball; masculinity; media framing; mental health; sport and health",,,,,,,,,"Abraham, A., Zhang, A.J., Ahn, R., Woodbridge, A., Korenstein, D., Keyhani, S., Media content analysis of marijuana’s health effects in news coverage (2018) Journal of General Internal Medicine, 33, pp. 1438-1440. , https://doi.org/10.1007/s11606-018-4492-9; Aldridge, D., NBA, NBPA taking steps to further address mental wellness issues for players (2018) NBA, , https://www.nba.com/article/2018/03/12/morning-tip-nba-nbpa-addressing-mental-wellness-issues, March, 12; Americans becoming more open about mental health (2019) American Psychological Association, , https://www.apa.org/news/press/releases/2019/05/mental-health-survey, May; Anderson, E., (2010) Inclusive masculinity: The changing nature of masculinities, , Routledge; Anderson, E., Kian, E.M., Examining media contestation of masculinity and head trauma in the National Football League (2012) Men and Masculinities, 15 (2), pp. 152-173. , https://doi.org/10.1177/1097184X11430127; Anderson, E., McGuire, R., Inclusive masculinity theory and the gendered politics of men’s rugby (2010) Journal of Gender Studies, 19 (3), pp. 249-261. , https://doi.org/10.1080/09589236.2010.494341; Anderson, M., ‘One flew over the psychiatric unit’: Mental illness and the media (2003) Journal of Psychiatric and Mental Health Nursing, 10 (3), pp. 297-306. , https://doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2850.2003.00592.x; Anglin, D.M., Alberti, P.M., Link, B.G., Phelan, J.C., Racial differences in beliefs about the effectiveness and necessity of mental health treatment (2008) American Journal of Community Psychology, 42 (1-2), pp. 17-24; Bandura, A., Social cognitive theory: An agentic perspective (2001) Annual Review of Psychology, 52 (1), pp. 1-26; Bauman, N.J., The stigma of mental health in athletes: Are mental toughness and mental health seen as contradictory in elite sport?

Data were collected using eight online surveys (n = 1,862). Each of the eight surveys focused on a single sport and either its national or international governing organization (e.g., athletics and the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) or athletics and the German Athletics Federation). Regression analyses revealed that sport interest, trust, age, and gender significantly influenced the overall image fit of the sport with the organization. Trust was significantly associated with both sport image and organization image. Sport organizations should become more adept at leveraging their association with their (positively viewed) athletes and their sport. To leverage the link with their sport, sport organizations should associate themselves with “feel good” dimensions of their sport. This study is the first to examine image fit between a sport and its domestic and international governing organization. © The Author(s) 2020.","image congruence; integrity; scandal; sport governance; trust",,,,,,,,,"Aaker, D.A., Keller, K.L., Consumer evaluations of brand extensions (1990) Journal of Marketing, 54 (1), pp. 27-41; Anderson, J.R., A spreading activation theory of memory (1983) Journal of Verbal Learning and Verbal Behavior, 22 (3), pp. 261-295; Andrew, D.P.S., Pedersen, P.M., McEvoy, C.D., (2011) Research methods and design in sport management, , Human Kinetics; Baumgarth, C., Methoden zur Markenfitanalyse [Methods for brand fit analysis] (2000) Planung & Analyse, 27 (5), pp. 48-52; Beerli, A., Martín, J.D., Factors influencing destination image (2004) Annals of Tourism Research, 31 (3), pp. 657-681; Bos, B., (2007) The image of a company, , Phaidon; Brandon-Lai, S.A., Armstrong, C.G., Ferris, G.R., Organisational impression congruence: A conceptual model of multi-level impression management operation in sports service organisations (2016) Sport Management Review, 19 (5), pp. 492-505. , https://doi.org/10.1016/j.smr.2016.06.002; Bromiley, P., Cummings, L., Transactions costs in organizations with trust (1995) Research on negotiations in organizations, pp. 219-247. , Bies R., Lewicki R., Sheard B., (eds), JAI Press, (Eds.), (., –; Carter, R.E., Curry, D.J., Perceptions versus performance when managing extensions: New evidence about the role of fit between a parent brand and an extension (2011) Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science, 41 (2), pp. 253-269. , https://doi.org/10.1007/s11747-011-0292-z; Collins, A.M., Loftus, E.F., A spreading-activation theory of semantic processing (1975) Psychological Review, 82 (6), pp. 407-428. , https://doi.org/10.1037/0033-295x.82.6.407; Compton, J., Compton, J.L., College sports, losing seasons, and image repair through open letters to fans (2014) Communication & Sport, 2 (4), pp. 345-362. , https://doi.org/10.1177/2167479513503542; Cummings, L., Bromiley, P., The Organizational Trust Inventory (OTI) (1996) Trust in organizations: Frontiers of theory and research, pp. 302-330. , Kramer R., Tyler T., (eds), Sage, : Development and validation.

Although the two nations had fielded unified teams at previous international sporting events, the decision to form a unified women’s ice hockey team in 2018 became a contentious political issue. To investigate the relationship between traditional media and social media when covering a controversial political issue in sport, the researchers in the current study examined newspaper coverage and Twitter commentary focused on the unified Korean women’s ice hockey team. Results indicated that newspapers played an important agenda-setting role; progressive newspapers were active in framing the team positively throughout the Olympic Games period, whereas conservative papers covered the team less frequently and framed it negatively. Discussion about the unified team on Twitter was initially positive but turned primarily negative when controversial statements from politicians and issues of unfairness in team selection arose. Ultimately, the results highlight elements of the symbiotic relationship between traditional media and social media. © The Author(s) 2020.","agenda setting; media framing; sentiment analysis; social media; text mining",,,,,,,,,"Andrews, E., How ping-pong diplomacy thawed the Cold War (2016) The History, , https://www.history.com/news/ping-pong-diplomacy; Bairner, A., Kelly, J., Lee, J.W., (2017) Routledge handbook of sport and politics, , Routledge, (Eds; Benkler, Y., (2006) The wealth of networks: How social production transforms markets and freedom, , Yale University Press; Bennett, W.L., Iyengar, S., A new era of minimal effects?

Some departments are contracting, others are moving their content to web-only, while others are simply trying to sustain themselves in modern ways. The purpose of this study was to examine how current local sports television journalists addressed the changing marketplace and what impact the procedural and technological changes had on the stories they delivered. Researchers conducted 30 semistructured interviews with current sports media practitioners who worked in newsrooms throughout the United States. The findings of this study rendered four themes, which cumulatively suggest local sports media practitioners are facing varied engagements with job satisfaction and productivity based on their adaptability with shifting expectations. The themes were underscored by the influence of a move to digital first as an industry standard, while specifically examining how social media influences behavior and engagement. The study concludes that, while there are pervasive traditional constraints on journalists, there are also more recent challenges that created complexities in the exchange of information. © The Author(s) 2020.","digital first; local television; routines; sports journalism",,,,,,,,,"Ali, C., The merits of merit goods: Local journalism and public policy in a time of austerity (2016) Journal of Information Policy, 6 (1), pp. 105-128; Andrews, K.T., Caren, N., Making the news: Movement organizations, media attention, and the public agenda (2010) American Sociological Review, 75 (6), pp. 841-866; Antunovic, D., We wouldn’t say it to their faces”: Online harassment, women sports journalists, and feminism (2019) Feminist Media Studies, 19 (3), pp. 428-442; Antunovic, D., Whiteside, E., Feminist sports media studies: State of the field (2018) Feminist approaches to media theory and research.

Among males, who accounted for 227 (81%) of the 264 athletes, African Americans and Latinos each represented 6 sports, most of which involved team competition, while White males represented 21 sports, many of which were individual. Analyses of position stacking in football showed White players in positions considered “central” to contest outcomes and Black athletes assigned to more “peripheral” roles. Among females, nearly all of whom were White, more than one in three participated in professional wrestling or sports entertainment. Other female athletes represented individual sports such as tennis and swimming. Overall, the study concludes that men’s magazines reproduced stacking patterns observed in earlier research. © The Author(s) 2020.","content analysis; gender; magazines; race; sports communication; stacking",,,,,,,,,"Abrahamson, D., Magazine exceptionalism: The concept, the criteria, the challenge (2007) Journalism Studies, 8 (4), pp. 667-670. , 10.1080/14616700701412225; Apoifis, N., Marlin, D., Bennie, A., Noble athlete, savage coach: How racialised representations of Aboriginal athletes impede professional sport coaching opportunities for Aboriginal Australians (2018) International Review for the Sociology of Sport, 53, pp. 854-868. , https://doi.org/10.1177/1012690216686337; Benwell, B., Ironic discourse: Evasive masculinity in men’s lifestyle magazines (2004) Men & Masculinities, 7, pp. 3-21. , 10.1177/1097184X03257438; Berghorn, F., Yetman, N., Hanna, W., Racial participation and integration in men’s and women’s intercollegiate basketball: Continuity and change, 1958-1985 (1988) Sociology of Sport Journal, 5, pp. 107-124. , https://doi.org/10.1123/ssj.5.2.107; Best, C., Experience and career length in professional football: The effect of positional segregation (1987) Sociology of Sport Journal, 4 (4), pp. 410-420. , https://doi.org/10.1123/ssj.4.4.410; Billings, A.C., Eastman, S.T., Selective representation of gender, ethnicity, and nationality in American television coverage of the 2000 Summer Olympics (2002) International Review for the Sociology of Sport, 37, pp. 351-370. , https://doi.org/10.1177/101269020203700302; Blalock, H.M., Jr., Occupational discrimination: Some theoretical propositions (1962) Social Problems, 9, pp. 240-247; Bopp, T., Sagas, M., Racial tasking and the college quarterback: Redefining the stacking phenomenon (2014) Journal of Sport Management, 28, pp. 136-142. , https://doi.org/10.1123/jsm.2012-0296; Brown, J., Bear, G., Minorities in major league baseball 1952-1987: Collector cards show who played where (1999) International Review for the Sociology of Sport, 34 (4), pp. 411-422. , https://doi.org/10.1177/1012699099034004008; Bruening, J.E., Gender and racial analysis in sport: Are all the women White and all the Blacks men?

As explored in hegemonic masculinity scholarship, to be successful, professional male athletes attempt to physically dominate opponents. In 2018, National Basketball Association (NBA) star Kevin Love disclosed having a panic attack during a game as well as living with depression and anxiety. While Love was not the only NBA player to publicly come forward to discuss their mental health experiences, Love is a successful White player in a league where 73.9% of players self-identify as Black or African American. His social location connects his public health discussion to existing scholarship on whiteness, hegemonic masculinity, and mental illness. Love was praised for his willingness to speak about his personal experiences and provide support for others. However, through a critical discourse analysis of sports media coverage of Love’s disclosure and subsequent mental health advocacy, this study reveals that his public discussion was constructed in terms of his identity as a White athlete and constrained by expectations of hegemonic masculinity. © The Author(s) 2020.","analysis; critical discourse; hegemonic masculinity; mental health; sports media discourse; whiteness",,,,,,,,,"Amick, S., NBA ramps up mental health setting new expectations for each team (2019) The Athletic, , https://theathletic.com/1120892/2019/08/07/nba-ramps-up-mental-health-program-setting-new-expectations-for-each-team/?redirected=1, August, 7; Bauman, N.J., The stigma of mental health in athletes: Are mental toughness and mental health seen as contradictory in elite sport?

The growth in talk radio was ignited by the Telecommunications Act of 1996, which allowed station owners to purchase more stations without antitrust scrutiny. One of the most popular formats on the radio is sports talk radio. Sports talk radio provides a unique entry point to understand how callers and hosts discuss racism in sport. The purpose of this study is to advance our understanding of race on the radio by examining how sports talk radio hosts discuss racism. The researcher interviewed 15 sports talk radio hosts over the phone to better understand how they discuss racism on the airwaves. After reviewing the transcripts and going through several rounds of data analysis, three themes were discovered: We can smell it, race is not always about race, and Black/White binary. © The Author(s) 2020.","color-blind racism ideology; meritocracy; race; radio; sport",,,,,,,,,"Axisa, M., (2016) MLB players association is disappointed by lack of Latino managers in MLB, , https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/news/mlb-players-association-is-disappointed-by-lack-of-latino-managers-in-mlb/, July, 12, CBSSports; Bennett, D., (2007) Institutional amplification and the quasi-liberal ideological work of sports talk radio, , Unpublished doctoral dissertation, University of Oregon, [,]; Bieler, D., ESPN’s Dan Le Batard rips President Trump, derides network’s no-politics policy (2019) Washington Post, , https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2019/07/19/espns-dan-le-batard-rips-president-trump-derides-networks-no-politics-policy/, July, 19; Bimper, A., Lifting the veil: Exploring color-blind racism in Black student athlete experiences (2015) Journal of Sport & Social Issues, 39, pp. 224-243. , https://doi.org/10.1177/0193723513520013; Bonilla-Silva, E., (2006) Racism without racists: Color-blind racism and racial inequality in contemporary America, , Rowman & Littlefield; Bonilla-Silva, E., The structure of racism in color-blind, “post-racial” America (2015) American Behavioral Scientist, 59, pp. 1358-1376. , https://doi.org/10.1177/0002764215586826; Bonilla-Silva, E., Dietrich, D., The sweet enchantment of color-blind racism in Obamerica (2011) The Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science, 634, pp. 190-206. , https://doi.org/10.1177/0002716210389702; Bonilla-Silva, E., Embrick, D.G., Are Blacks color blind too?

In this study, we draw from critical race theory (CRT) to interrogate cyber racism against Black male athletes in the http://TexAgs.com OBC. The primary purpose of this study was to conduct an exploratory collective case study of fan-generated discourse about Michael Bennett, Mike Evans, Myles Garrett, and Von Miller. Content analysis was used to examine and uncover the racially charged language directed toward these athletes. Three salient, interrelated themes were (1) good Aggie versus bad Aggie dichotomy, (2) dumb/misguided, and (3) thug. In line with the counter-narrative/storytelling tenet of CRT, we present Michael Bennett’s (2018) personal narrative from his book to directly counter the racialized discourse about his peers and him on TexAgs. Based on the findings, we conclude with implications for sport communication and social justice in both the public sphere and cyberspaces. © The Author(s) 2020.","athlete activism; Black male athletes; critical race theory; cyber racism; online brand community",,,,,,,,,"Agyemang, K., Singer, J.N., DeLorme, J., An exploratory study of Black male college athletes’ perceptions on race and athlete activism (2010) International Review for the Sociology of Sport, 45 (4), pp. 419-435; Back, L., Aryans reading Adorno: Cyber-culture and twenty-first century racism (2002) Ethnic and Racial Studies, 25 (4), pp. 628-651; Bell, D., (1992) Faces at the bottom of the well: The permanence of racism, , Basic Books; Bennett, G., Building a strong new media brand: The case of TexAgs.com (2017) Sport Marketing Quarterly, 26, pp. 153-167; Bennett, M., Zirin, D., (2018) Things that make White people uncomfortable, , Haymarket Books; Bowman, N.D., Cranmer, G.A., SocialMediaSport: The fan as a (mediated) participant in spectator sports (2016) Routledge handbook of sport and new media, pp. 213-224. , Billings A.C., Hardin M., (eds), Routledge, (Eds.), (., –; Carrington, B., (2010) Race, sport and politics: The sporting black diaspora, , Sage; Carrington, B., The critical sociology of race and sport: The first fifty years (2013) Annual Review of Sociology, 39, pp. 379-398; Chennault, R.E., Giving Whiteness a Black eye: An interview with Michael Eric Dyson (1998) White reign: Deploying Whiteness in America, pp. 299-328. , Kincheloe J.L., Steinberg S.R., Rodriguez N.M., Chennault R.E., (eds), St. Martin’s Press, (Eds.), (., –; Clavio, G., Demographics and usage profiles of users of college sport message boards (2008) International Journal of Sport Communication, 1 (4), pp. 434-443; Cleland, J., Racism, football fans, and online message boards: How social media has added a new dimension to racist discourse in English football (2014) Journal of Sport and Social Issues, 38 (5), pp. 415-431; Cooper, J.N., Macaulay, C., Rodriguez, S.H., Race and resistance: A typology of African American sport activism (2019) International Review for the Sociology of Sport, 54 (2), pp. 151-181; Crenshaw, K., Gotanda, N., Peller, G., Thomas, K., (1995) Critical race theory: The key writings that formed the movement, , New Press; Cunningham, G.B., Dixon, M.A., Singer, J.N., Oshiro, K.F., Ahn, N.Y., Weems, A., A site to resist and persist: Diversity, social justice, and the unique nature of sport (2019) Journal of Global Sport Management, , http://doi.org/10.1080/24704067.2019.1578623; Daniels, J., (2009) Cyber racism: White supremacy online and the new attack on civil rights, , Rowman & Littlefield Publishers; Edwards, H., (2016) The fourth wave: Black athlete protests in the second decade of the 21st century, , November 3, [Keynote address], North American Society for the Sociology of Sport Conference, Tampa Bay, FL, United States; Feagin, J.R., (2006) Systemic racism: A theory of oppression, , Routledge; Feagin, J.R., (2013) The White racial frame: Centuries of racial framing and counter-framing, , 2nd ed, Routledge; Frisby, W., The good, the bad, and the ugly: Critical sport management research (2005) Journal of Sport Management, 19 (1), pp. 1-12; Galily, Y., The (re)shaping of the Israeli sport media: The case of talk-back (2008) International Journal of Sport Communication, 1 (3), pp. 273-285; Gill, E.L., Hands up, don’t shoot” or shut up and play ball?

The central aim of the current research was to explore how outsiders perceive the communication of Deaf athletes who communicate via American Sign Language (ASL) in the sport of college basketball. Cultural identity theory (CIT) provided a theoretical foundation for the current research, while the extant literature on small groups was discussed to provide insight on intrateam messages. The participants in this study completed a pretest that centered on sports communication, partook in a distraction exercise, were informed they were analyzing Deaf athletes who communicate in ASL, and then completed a post-test that centered on sports communication. One of the main findings was that Deaf basketball players were perceived to share messages of acceptance with one another. Additional results revealed that Deaf basketball players were perceived to resolve conflict in a positive manner and were less likely to engage in negative conflict while communicating with teammates. Implications for CIT were a focal point in the study discussion as were practical implications tied to effective communication in team sports. © The Author(s) 2020.","American Sign Language (ASL); cultural identity theory (CIT); Deaf culture; inclusion; small group communication",,,,,,,,,"Bauman, H.D.L., Murray, J.J., (2014) Deaf gain: Raising the stakes for human diversity, , University of Minnesota Press, (Eds; Bell, D., Carl, A., Swart, E., Students with hearing impairment at a South African university: Self-identity and disclosure (2016) African Journal of Disability, 5, pp. e1-e9. , https://doi.org/104102/ajod.v5i1.229; Chen, Y.W., Collier, M.J., Intercultural identity positioning: Interview discourses from identity-based nonprofit organizations (2012) Journal of International and Intercultural Communication, 5, pp. 44-63. , https://doi.org/101080/17513057.2011.631215; Collier, M.J., (1998) Researching cultural identity: Reconciling interpretive and post-colonial perspectives, pp. 122-147. , Tanno D.V., González A., (eds), International and intercultural communication annual:. 21.

A result of this mediatisation, coupled with technological advancement, has been the introduction of decision-aid technologies in sport. Existing literature on decision-aid technologies has generally focused on the technologies themselves. Here, we focus on decision-aid technology use and its impact on event experience. This article examines fan attitudes towards the use of the Television Match Official (TMO) in rugby union in relation to the event experience. We present data from a global online questionnaire (n = 194) and 11 semi-structured interviews with fans, representatives from rugby’s governing bodies, two TMOs, and a television producer. Data show an inconsistency in how TMO decisions are relayed to match crowds, which had an impact on events experience. The data also reveal how heavily reliant the TMO system is on broadcasters. Fans were generally in favour of TMO use, but they did want to be better informed when it came to TMO referrals and decisions. Indeed, fans said improvements to TMO decision delivery in stadia, specifically having audio of referee/TMO discussions/decisions relayed over the stadium PA system and/or captions providing explanations and decisions on TMO referrals, would mostly improve their event experience. © The Author(s) 2020.","decision-aid technology; fans; rugby union; sports events; Television Match Official",,,,,,,,,"Axford, B., Huggins, R., The telemediatization of cricket: Commerce, connectivity and culture in the post-television age (2010) Cricket and globalization, pp. 122-151. , Rumford C., Wagg S., (eds), Cambridge Scholars Press, (Eds.), (., –; Billings, A.C., Wenner, L.A., The curious case of the mega sporting event: Media, mediatization and seminal sports events (2017) Sport, media ad mega-events, pp. 3-18. , Wenner L.A., Billings A.C., (eds), Routledge, (Eds.), (., –; Bouchet, P., Bodet, G., Bernache-Assollant, I., Kada, F., Segmenting sport spectators: Construction and preliminary validation of the Sport Event Experience Search (SEES) scale (2011) Sport Management Review, 14, pp. 42-53; Boyle, R., Reflections on communication and sport: On journalism and digital culture (2013) Communication & Sport, 1, pp. 88-99; Bryman, A., (2016) Social research methods, , 5th ed, Oxford University Press; Cairns, G., The hybridization of sight in the hybrid architecture of sport: The effects of television on stadia and spectatorship (2015) Sport in Society, 18, pp. 734-749; Clemes, M.D., Brush, G.J., Collins, M.J., Analysing the professional sport experience: A hierarchical approach (2011) Sport Management Review, 14, pp. 370-388; Collins, H., The philosophy of umpiring and the introduction of decision-aid technology (2010) Journal of the Philosophy of Sport, 37, pp. 135-146; Collins, H., Evans, R., You cannot be serious!

A total of 2,296 people from six different nations (Canada, China, Germany, Japan, Sweden, and the United States) were surveyed about their social TV usage, degree of social presence, and team identification in the week following the 2018 Winter Olympics in PyeongChang, South Korea. Primary findings illustrate that increased social TV use predicts increased measures of social presence, social capital, and perceived sociability, which then influences one’s identification with their national team and Winter Olympics fandom.

Such differences can provide objective evidence of objectification by demonstrating a gender bias in terms of visual attention to female reporters’ bodies. This experiment (N = 66) employs eye tracking to measure how much attention viewers allocated to male and female reporters’ bodies versus their faces, as well as differences in perceived credibility as a function of reporter gender. Results revealed a greater ratio of time on female reporters’ bodies to their faces relative to male reporters. This effect was most evident among viewers with reduced interest in sports. Furthermore, visual attention to reporters’ bodies—a passive measure of objectification—was largely unrelated to perceived credibility. Implications of these findings are discussed with respect to female objectification in sports and how this might inform program production personnel. © The Author(s) 2018.","attention; credibility; eye tracking; gender; objectification; sports broadcasting",,,,,,,,,"Andsager, J.L., Perceptions of credibility of male and female syndicated political columnists (1990) Journalism Quarterly, 67, pp. 485-491; Baiocchi-Wagner, E.A., Behm-Morawitz, E., Audience perceptions of female sports reporters: A social-identity approach (2010) International Journal of Sport Communication, 3, pp. 261-274; Bem, S.L., Gender schema theory: A cognitive account of sex typing (1981) Psychological Review, 88, pp. 354-364; Billings, A.C., Angelini, J.R., Packaging the games for viewer consumption: Gender, ethnicity, and nationality in NBC’s coverage of the 2004 summer Olympics (2007) Communication Quarterly, 55, pp. 95-111; Billings, A.C., Halone, K.K., Denham, B.E., Man, that was a pretty shot”: An analysis of gendered broadcast commentary surrounding the 2000 men’s and women’s NCAA Final Four basketball championships (2002) Mass Communication & Society, 5, pp. 295-315; Bissell, K., Duke, A.M., Bump, set, spike: An analysis of commentary and camera angles of women’s beach volleyball during the 2004 summer Olympics (2007) Journal of Promotion Management, 13, pp. 35-53; Brann, M., Himes, K.L., Perceived credibility of male vs. female television newscasters (2010) Communication Research Reports, 27, pp. 243-252; Chaiken, S., Heuristic versus systematic information processing and the use of source versus message cues in persuasion (1980) Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 39, pp. 752-766; Cooky, C., Messner, M.A., Hextrum, R.H., Women play sport, but not on TV: A longitudinal study of televised news media (2013) Communication & Sport, 1, pp. 203-230; Cooky, C., Messner, M.A., Musto, M., It’s dude time!”: A quarter century of excluding women’s sports in televised news and highlight shows (2015) Communication & Sport, 3, pp. 261-287; Cummins, R.G., Eye tracking and visual attention to sports in new media (2014) Handbook of sports and new media, pp. 271-284. , Billings A., Hardin M., (eds), Thousand Oaks, CA, Sage, (Eds.), (., –; Daniels, E.A., Sexy versus strong: What girls and women think of female athletes (2012) Journal of Applied Developmental Psychology, 33, pp. 79-90; Davis, D.C., Krawczyk, J., Female sportscaster credibility: Has appearance taken precedence?

Until recently, studies have predominately used quantitative content analyses that, although providing useful interrogation of observational patterns, limit the understanding of and appreciation for the contexts that may have shaped the production of information. By focusing exclusively on the “what” and on the “how much,” it is difficult to reveal the “why” and to identify the underlying motives of any changes. This article recognizes the nuances of the editorial decision-making process by using a mixed-methods approach, employing quantitative and qualitative data drawn from a case study focusing on the Spanish media coverage of the 2008 and 2012 Paralympic Games. An initial content analysis of all news published in Spain’s 12 highest circulation newspapers during Beijing 2008 and London 2012 Paralympic Games was undertaken. Subsequently, 15 semistructured interviews were conducted with journalists that were also sent to these two iterations of the Paralympic Games by Spanish media. Drawing on conceptualisations of media framing, the results highlight that the numerical data alone shed insufficient light on the complexity of the news-making process. The semistructured interviews brought to light issues such as editorial management buoyed by commercial imperatives, and organisational interjection in journalists’ narratives and authorship, that also contoured coverage and content. In addition to further debate about the complexities of media coverage of Paralympic sport, the study underscores the utility of incorporating and combining qualitative methodologies within sport media and communication research. © The Author(s) 2018.","disability; framing; journalism; media studies; Paralympic Games",,,,,,,,,"Bagenstos, S.R., (2014) Law and the contradictions of the disability rights movement, , London, England, Yale University Press; Barnes, C., Theories of disability and the origins of the oppression of disabled people in Western society (1999) Disability and society: Emerging issues and insights, pp. 43-60. , Barton L., (ed), New York, NY, Pearson, (Ed.), (., –; Bastos, M.T., Shares, pins, and tweets: News readership from daily papers to social media (2015) Journalism Studies, 16, pp. 305-325; Baynton, D.C., Disability and the justification of inequality in American history (2001) The new disability history: American perspectives, pp. 33-56. , Longmore P.K., Umansky L., (eds), New York, New York University Press, (Eds.), (., –; Billings, A.C., Eastman, S.T., Framing identities: Gender, ethnic, and national parity in network announcing of the 2002 Winter Olympics (2003) Journal of Communication, 53, pp. 569-586; Boykoff, J., Yasuoka, M., Gender and politics at the 2012 Olympics: Media coverage and its implications (2015) Sport in Society, 18, pp. 219-233; Braye, S., I’m not an activist : An exploratory investigation into retired British Paralympic athlete’s views on the relationship between the Paralympic Games and disability equality in the UK (2016) Disability and Society, 31, pp. 1288-1300; Braye, S., Dixon, K., Gibbons, T., A mockery of equality : An exploratory investigation into disabled activists’ views of the Paralympic Games (2013) Disability and Society, 28, pp. 984-996; Brittain, I., (2010) The Paralympic Games explained, , London, England, Routledge; Buysse, J.A.M., Borcherding, B., Framing gender and disability: A cross-cultural analysis of photographs from the 2008 Paralympic Games (2010) International Journal of Sport Communication, 3 (3), pp. 308-321; Chang, H.H., Social change and the disability rights movement in Taiwan 1981-2002 (2014) Review of Disability Studies: An International Journal, 3, pp. 1-17; Cherney, J.L., Lindemann, K., Hardin, M., Research in communication, disability, and sport (2015) Communication & Sport, 3, pp. 8-26; D’Angelo, P., Kuypers, J.A., (2010) Doing news framing analysis: Empirical and theoretical perspectives, , London, England, Routledge; De Haan, D., Paralympic athletes’ perspectives of media coverage.

In this article, we report findings from a study of South Korean mainstream and alternative print media coverage of the controversial development of Mount Gariwang for the 2018 PyeongChang Winter Olympic and Paralympic Games. Our study focused on (1) how the decisions and events unfolding around the development of Mount Gariwang were portrayed in South Korean mainstream and alternative news coverage and (2) how the issues at play were politicized and/or depoliticized within and across these outlets. We found that differences in coverage of environmental issues were starkest between, on one side, conservative mainstream media and, on the other side, left-leaning mainstream and alternative media outlets. We also found that environmental controversies were variably politicized or depoliticized in differently positioned media outlets—with left leaning and alternative media highlighting concerns about Olympic-related hypocrisy and corruption, and right-leaning media usually featuring depoliticizing statements from Olympic and government elites. All media outlets highlighted questions about why viable and existing venues were not being used instead of Mount Gariwang, with economic and environmental issues being emphasized differently across outlets.

However, fantasy sport has recently emerged as a potential threat to team fandom, particularly with regard to the interactivity provided by the virtual game. Research has found evidence that fantasy sport can be both a substitute and a complement to traditional team fandom. However, with limited control over traditional team outcomes and perceived control over fantasy team outcomes, interactivity has emerged as a potential differentiator between the two forms of fandom. Guided by the fantasy football participation and consumption model and endowment theory, the current study conducted an implicit association experiment on the interactivity and passiveness of contemporary professional sport fandom. These results were combined with self-report data to explore potential indicators of implicit bias. The experiment uncovered an association of interactivity to favorite team players and passiveness to fantasy team players. The post hoc examination of potential predictors found the drive to compete, and in-season game outcomes positively impacted the unexpected interactivity implicit bias. © The Author(s) 2018.","fantasy sports; implicit association test; interactivity; sport spectatorship",,,,,,,,,"Ariel, Y., Avidar, R., Information, interactivity, and social media (2015) Atlantic Journal of Communication, 23, pp. 19-30; Fantasy football isn’t just for fans—NFL players are hooked, too (2009) NFL.com, , http://www.nfl.com/news/story/09000d5d8145ad3d/article/fantasy-football-isnt-just-for-fans-nfl-players-are-hooked-too, November, 20, Retrieved from; Batey, M., (2016) Brand meaning: Meaning, myth and mystique in today’s brands, , London, England, Routledge; Bednall, D.H., Valos, M., Adam, S., McLeod, C., Getting generation Y to attend: Friends, interactivity and half-time entertainment (2012) Sport Management Review, 15, pp. 80-90; Bernhard, B.J., Eade, V.H., Gambling in a fantasy world: An exploratory study of rotisserie baseball games (2005) UNLV Gaming Research & Review Journal, 9, pp. 29-42; Billings, A., Ruihley, B.J., Yang, Y., Fantasy gaming on steroids?

Historically, European football had strong local roots; sport organizations represented local values and fandom were regionally based. However, sporting competitiveness pushes clubs to search for new investors, and foreign investors in Europe are attracted by the popularity of European football. In this article, we analyse how Chinese capital and brands arrived in Barcelona, through the negotiations of a football club in 2016: the Reial Club Deportiu Espanyol (RCDE). RCDE is the club that has received the second most trophies in Catalonia, after FC Barcelona, since the beginning of the 20th century. Today, it has one of the most modern stadiums in Spain, designed using a business approach, and has become a corporate ambassador for the Chinese government’s strategy of becoming a “world football superpower” by 2050. Using a case study approach, this article analyses management and corporate identity changes in the organization due to the new Chinese owner: the Rastar Group. © The Author(s) 2018.","China; Chinese Super League; corporate identity; Rastar Group; RCD Espanyol",,,,,,,,,"Anholt, S., (2010) Places: Identity, image and reputation, , Hampshire, England, Palgrave Macmillan; Buckley, C., President Xi’s great Chinese soccer dream (2017) The New York Times, , https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/04/world/asia/china-soccer-xi-jinping.html, January, 4, Retrieved from; Campbell, C., China wants to become a “soccer superpower” by 2050 (2016) Time Magazine, , http://time.com/4290251/china-soccer-superpower-2050-football-fifa-world-cup/, April, 12, Retrieved from; Connell, J., Globalisation, soft power, and the rise of football in China (2018) Geographical Research, 56, pp. 5-15; Corpas, A., Así es chen yansheng, el multimillonario nuevo dueño del Espanyol (2016) El Mundo, , http://www.elmundo.es/deportes/2016/01/31/56ad187a268e3e157c8b464e.html, January, 31, Retrieved from; Cull, N.J., Public diplomacy: Taxonomies and histories (2008) The ANNALS of the American Academy of Political and Social Science, 616, pp. 31-54; Escudero, J., Delfín, L.A., Gutiérrez, L., El estudio de caso como estrategia de investigación en las ciencias sociales [The case study as an strategy for Social Sciencies research] (2008) Ciencia Administrativa, 2008, pp. 7-10; Fernández, E., La caída de Wanda, la compañía que quería devorar a Disney (2017) El Confidencial, , https://www.elconfidencial.com/mundo/2017-08-29/la-caida-de-wanda-la-compania-que-queria-devorar-a-disney_1435325/, August, 29, Retrieved from; Ginesta, X., Spanish football clubs’ own media.

Results show that women athletes received the majority of clock-time and name mentions during the 2018 coverage of the games, continuing a trend toward increased focus on women’s sports and athletics over the two-decade composite.

Media has been a key site of struggle in these developments, with attacks on mainstream media bringing into focus wider questions of truth and legitimacy in journalism. In particular, Trump’s rise has been synonymous with the heightened profile of the Breitbart News website, a purveyor of hyperpartisan, conservative political ideologies. In this article, we consider the place of Breitbart Sports within this dynamic political and media order. Our analysis of the lead-up to the 2016 Presidential election reveals the extent to which Breitbart Sports conveyed a vision of U.S. sport that promoted hard-right agendas in relation to U.S. global stewardship, veiled “race” reclamation discourses, media, immigration, social criticism, policing, sexual politics, and party politics. Breitbart Sports framing casts sport as a liberally infested cultural battleground, where conservativism is under threat. We conclude with a brief discussion about the role of new media in framing political exigencies and the role of sport in contemporary American society. © The Author(s) 2018.","Alt-right; Breitbart Sports; hyperpartisan media; metapolitics; Trump",,,,,,,,,"(2016) Trump Investment Pays Off as Former Club Pro Reaches Masters, , http://www.breitbart.com, April, 4, Retrieved from; Ahmed, S., Affective economies (2004) Social Text, 22, pp. 117-139; Alexa, (2017) Breitbart.com traffic statistics, , http://www.alexa.com, Retrieved from; Benkler, Y., Faris, R., Roberts, H., Zuckerman, E., Study: Breitbart-led right-wing media ecosystem altered broader media agenda (2017) Columbia Journalism Review, , https://www.cjr.org/analysis/breitbart-media-trump-harvard-study.php, Retrieved from; (2013) Breitbart sports launches new year’s day 2013, , http://www.breitbart.com/sports/2012/12/31/welcome-to-breitbart-sports/, January, 1, Retrieved from; (2016) How Breitbart became Donald Trump’s favourite news site, , http://www.bbc.com/news, November, 14, Retrieved from; Burley, S., (2017) Fascism today.

Fans are fans for a variety of reasons and show their fanship in an assortment of ways. In many studies, sports fanship is based on predetermined categories and closed-ended questions set by researchers. Such categories and questions may include certain types of fans while omitting others. This study assessed the extent to which closed-ended categorizations align with fans’ views of their own fanship. It also captured what it means to be—or not be—a sports fan from the respondent’s perspective. A total of 1,093 adults completed questionnaires using Amazon’s Mechanical Turk. In response to a dichotomous choice question, roughly half self-reported as fans. A majority of self-identified fans described strong emotional and personal ties with sports. Most nonfans found little connection with sports: Sports were boring and inconsistent with how they defined themselves. Open-ended responses from a small proportion of fans and a larger subset of nonfans call into question the validity of a single, dichotomous choice measure of fanship. The results of this study document the importance of explicit conceptualizations and operationalizations of sports fanship. © The Author(s) 2018.","media; open-ended; sports; sports fanship; survey",,,,,,,,,"Billings, A.C., Ruihley, B.J., Why we watch, why we play: The relationship between fantasy sport and fanship motivations (2013) Mass Communication and Society, 16, pp. 5-25; Broughton, D., Stalwarts thrive; AmEx, Taco Bell struggle in NBA sponsor loyalty survey (2017) Street & Smith’s SportsBusiness Journal, 24-30, p. 10. , http://www.sportsbusinessdaily.com/Journal/Issues/2017/07/24/Research-and-Ratings/NBA-sponsor-loyalty.aspx, Retrieved from; Brown, N., Billings, A.C., Ruihley, B., Exploring the change in motivations for fantasy sport participation during the life cycle of a sports fan (2012) Communication Research Reports, 29, pp. 333-342; Casler, K., Bickel, L., Hackett, E., Separate but equal?

A total of 85,649 users’ comments were collected and analyzed within the context of framing. The themes emerging from the data suggested a strong nationalistic narrative, with some accompanying narratives addressing the issues Kaepernick and Rapinoe desired to highlight through their activism. The nationalistic frames discussed what constituted American values and the consequences for not conforming to those values. The non-nationalistic themes targeted the social issues related to the two athletes. In terms of differences between the two athletes, users attacked Kaepernick’s specific characteristics (i.e., race and sex), while Rapinoe’s data contained discussions surrounding the role of athletes.

To understand these portrayals, all 557 hr and 15 min of National Broadcasting Company’s (NBC) 2018 Winter Olympic telecasts were recorded. This recorded content included the 62 hr and 30 min of NBC’s primetime program and, for the first time, all of the remaining non-NBC primetime coverage on NBC’s other networks. Women athletes received the majority of the clock time on the NBC primetime broadcast; however, men received significantly more clock time on the remaining Olympic telecasts. Additionally, for both sets of broadcasts, differences were found between the amount of coverage for men and women athletes by sport. Through the lens of agenda-setting theory, potential reasons and ramifications for the different trends of coverage by broadcast are discussed. © The Author(s) 2018.","agenda setting; broadcasting; gender; Olympics; television",,,,,,,,,"Angelini, J.R., How did the sport make you feel?

Moreover, Chinese respondents reported higher gratifications obtained than American respondent on all 12 factors.

Accordingly, concussion recovery can induce grieving processes as athletes navigate the loss of athletic participation, social networks, and daily routine disruption. This research sought to gain a richer understanding of athletes’ lived experiences with concussions through grief discourse shared in online narratives. Through an analysis of athletes’ experiences shared via 58 blog posts on three concussion websites, the data reveal how athletes frame the losses that concussions bring into their lives, the subsequent feelings and expressions that result, along with how they eventually cope. The information disclosed in these online spaces can benefit parents, friends, coaches, and others to better understand concussion recovery, thereby enhancing their supportive communication and behaviors towards athletes as they rehabilitate from concussions. © The Author(s) 2018.","athletes and concussions; grief; online forums; online support groups; sport and health",,,,,,,,,"Albrecht, T.L., Goldsmith, D.J., Social support, social networks, and health (2003) Handbook of health communication, pp. 263-284. , Thompson T., (ed), Hillsdale, NJ, Erlbaum, et al.

This situation is partly explained by the fact mobile media encompass practices, technologies, and markets that are grounded historically in the telecommunications and information technology industries, which sit apart from the broadcast (radio and television) and print (newspapers and magazines) media that dominated the transmission, circulation, and representation of professional sport for over a century. It is now time to build a research agenda dedicated to the study of mobile media and communications, especially given the proliferation of mobile digital computing and mobile Internet. Three reasons are presented in support of this argument. First, mobile media and telecommunications introduce stories into the history of media sport that need to be recognised if its contemporary features are to be properly contextualised and understood. Second, these stories are linked to an expanded range of meanings, technologies, and infrastructures captured by the term media that must now be accounted for. Third, mobile media reveal accelerating forms of hyper-commodification that are locking media sport into privately controlled market frameworks. A mobile research agenda also offers the potential for media sport scholarship to make a sustained contribution to the study of mediatisation processes, as well as mobile media and communications studies. © The Author(s) 2018.","hyper-commodification; mediatisation; mobile media; mobile technologies; smartphones; telecommunications; the telephone",,,,,,"FT130100506

One goal is to look at the extent and nature of media coverage of the Paralympics. Another goal of the research is to examine whether female Paralympians are exposed to the dual burden of sexist and ablest ideology in the media. Over 2 years, data from 100 articles were collected from three local Singaporean and Asian media sources; additionally, interviews and a survey were conducted with both Paralympians and citizens from the disabled community as well as a cohort of nondisabled Singaporean citizens. Findings suggest that coverage of Paralympic sport is significantly low, and that patriotism is more starkly linked to the Paralympics than the Olympics. Findings also suggest that othering (presenting the disabled as passive as well as challenged), or the supercrip narrative is apparent. Disabled women athletes tend to be overrepresented in passive poses out of the sport field. Finally, and more positively, the study finds that there are many images of Paralympian women as sophisticated and attractive without being sexually provocative. Therefore, evidence of sexual objectification or presentation of asexual disabled women tends not to be as present, as other similar studies have found. © The Author(s) 2018.","male-dominated sport media;

The National Collegiate Athletic Association has focused primarily on concussion injury education to encourage self-reporting; however, such efforts have not been especially effective and many potential injuries continue to go unreported. This research investigates cultural narratives, derived from sports media and popular culture, and how their narrative logics contribute to the context in which student-athletes make head injury reporting decisions and how these narratives offer templates for understanding potential consequences. We argue that performance-oriented narratives are more prevalent and showcase pathways to more immediate satisfaction of desires or goals. Ultimately, we argue that not only does analysis of prevailing cultural narratives illuminate the context in which athletes make reporting decisions but also that such understanding could inform narrative-based interventions in order to emphasize and model recommended behaviors, such as injury reporting, and values, such as long-term brain health and player wellness. © The Author(s) 2018.","concussion reporting; cultural narrative; media influence; narrative logic; sports communication",,,,,,,,,"Adams, A., Anderson, E., McCormack, M., Establishing and challenging masculinity: The influence of gendered discourses in organized sport (2010) Journal of language and social psychology, 29 (3), pp. 278-300; Anderson, E., Kian, E.M., Examining media contestation of masculinity and head trauma in the National Football League (2012) Men and Masculinities, 15, pp. 152-173; Players still willing to hide head injuries (2011) ESPN.com, , http://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/7388074/nfl-players-say-hiding-concussions-option, December, 26, Retrieved from; Baezconde-Garbanati, L.A., Chatterjee, J.S., Frank, L.B., Murphy, S.T., Moran, M.B., Werth, L.N., Tamale lesson: A case study of a narrative health communication intervention (2014) Journal of Communication in Healthcare, 7, pp. 82-92. , …; Bagley, A.F., Daneshvar, D.H., Schanker, B.D., Zurakowski, D., d’Hemecourt, C.A., Nowinski, C.J., Effectiveness of the SLICE program for youth concussion education (2012) Clinical Journal of Sports Medicine, 22, pp. 385-389. , …; Baker, A., (2003) Contesting identities: Sports in American film, , Champaign, University of Illinois Press; Baker, A., Boyd, T., (1997) Out of bounds: Sports, media, and the politics of identity, , Bloomington, Indiana University Press, (Eds; Baugh, C.M., Kiernan, P.T., Kroshus, E., Daneshvar, D.H., Montenigro, P.H., McKee, A.C., Stern, R.A., Frequency of head-impact-related outcomes by position in NCAA division I collegiate football players (2015) Journal of Neurotrauma, 32, pp. 314-326; Bernstein, R., (Executive producer) (2015) Girls interrupted/vision quest/the price of glory [Television series episode].

This article explains head coaches’ use of confirmation, which is comprised of accepting and challenging communication, as a function of athletes’ roles and leader–member exchange (LMX). Data obtained from 197 high school athletes—representing 17 sports and from 16 states—substantiated that starters receive more recognition and acknowledgement of their efforts and accomplishments (i.e., acceptance) but are not more likely to receive communication that seeks the refinement of their potential (i.e., challenge). LMX with head coaches, however, accounted for much larger portions of variance in reports of receiving confirmation, with in-group relationships being predictive of greater amounts of confirmation. These results indicate that confirmation is received as a function of the roles of athletes and their interpersonal relationships with coaches. Such findings provide mechanisms to explain disparate experiences of confirmation and connect two theoretical bodies of literature in a manner that intersects the organizational and interpersonal processes of coaching. © The Author(s) 2018.","coach communication; coach confirmation; leader–member exchange; sport communication",,,,,,,"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: The Robert H.

Despite Korea’s long history of sporting nationalism, the unexpected public support for Ahn has inspired popular and academic discussions regarding whether this nationalism is in fact weakening. I begin by exploring explanations for Ahn’s continuing popularity in Korea and how critiques of the Korean Skating Union have spread to other aspects of Korean society. Next, I examine the representation of Ahn as a role model for the desirable cosmopolitan subject with flexible citizenship who is able to transcend national borders in the pursuit of individual success. I argue, however, that Korea’s embrace of Ahn is less an indication that nationalism has been waning than it is a reclamation of Koreanness and a manifestation of a desire for national strength articulated through the conflation of traditional ethnic and developmental nationalism with neoliberal ideology. My ultimate goal, then, is to offer a nuanced understanding of the changing characteristics of sporting nationalism and citizenship in the era of neoliberal globalization. © The Author(s) 2018.","flexible citizenship; nationalism; South Korea; sports celebrity; Viktor Ahn",,,,,,,,,"Ahn, J.-H., Rearticulating black mixed-race in the era of globalization (2014) Cultural Studies, 28, pp. 391-417; Ahn, J.-M., Park, K., A study on the comparison press dot coms with portal sites: Related news, hyperlink, and reply of the internet media (2007) Journal of Communication Science, 7, pp. 335-372; Anderson, B.R.O., (2006) Imagined communities: Reflections on the origin and spread of nationalism, , London, England, Verso; Andrews, D.L., Jackson, S.J., (2001) Sport stars: The cultural politics of sporting celebrity, , London, England, Routledge, (Eds; Arnold, Z., (2008) The story of choo sung-hoon, , http://www.fightopinion.com/2008/01/01/the-story-of-choo-sung-hoon/, January, 1, Retrieved January 11, 2018, from; Bairner, A., (2001) Sport, nationalism, and globalization, , Albany, State University of New York Press; Bairner, A., Assessing the sociology of sport: On national identity and nationalism (2015) International Review for the Sociology of Sport, 50, pp. 375-379; Bhabha, H.K., (1990) Nation and narration, , London, England, Routledge, (Ed; Borden, S., Rejecting the U.S. to skate for Russia (2014) The New York Times, , https://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/10/sports/olympics/ahn-rejected-us-to-skate-for-russia.html, February, 9, Retrieved from; Calhoun, C., Cosmopolitanism and nationalism (2008) Nations and Nationalism, 14, p. 427; Campbell, E., The end of ethnic nationalism?

The inclusion of action sports into the Olympic programmes has been a key strategy to try and connect with youth consumers, most recently through the inclusion of skateboarding, surfing, and sport climbing into the Tokyo 2020 summer games. Drawing on a questionnaire distributed online in nine languages, and contextualized with analysis of the action sport media, our research explores international and multigenerational action sport consumers’ sport viewing preferences and attitudes to the Olympic inclusion of action sports. Our findings suggest that action sport participants across different countries, ages, and genders are avid consumers of action sport media but also keen consumers of the Olympics. The majority of survey participants were enthusiastic about the inclusion of action sports (and particularly skateboarding) into the Olympic Games, although there were important trends across nationalities and ages. Nonetheless, reflecting debates in the subcultural media, participants also have concerns about the processes and politics of action sports inclusion. Action sports may well provide the International Olympic Committee with new lucrative markets, but to maximise the engagement of complex intergenerational audiences, their viewing preferences will need continued attention and understanding. © The Author(s) 2018.","action sport; Generation Y; Olympics; skateboarding; Tokyo 2020; youth",,,,,,,"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: Research conducted with an IOC Advanced Research Programme Grant (2015).",,"(2018) State of play Harlem, , https://assets.aspeninstitute.org/content/uploads/2018/04/HarlemSOP_FINAL_4.9.18.pdf, April, Retrieved from; Bauder, D., Olympics prove popular with TV viewers (2010) Times Free Press, , http://www.timesfreepress.com/news/olympics2010/story/2010/feb/16/olympics-prove-popular-tv-viewers/5958/, February, 16, Retrieved from; Beal, B., Smith, M., Maverick’s: Big-wave surfing and the dynamic of “nothing” and “something (2010) Sport in Society: Cultures, Commerce, Media, Politics, 13, pp. 1102-1116; Beal, B., Weidman, L., Authenticity in the skateboarding world (2003) To the extreme: Alternative sports inside and out, pp. 337-352. , Rinehart R., Sydnor S., (eds), Albany, SUNY Press, (Eds.), (., –; Beal, B., Wilson, C., Chicks dig scars”: Commercialisation and the transformations of skate boarders’ identities (2004) Understanding lifestyle sports: Consumption, identity and difference, pp. 31-54. , Wheaton B., (ed), London, England, Routledge, (Ed.), (., –; Beall, G., (2016) November 5). 8 Key differences between Gen Z and millennials [Blog post], , https://www.huffingtonpost.com/george-beall/8-key-differences-between_b_12814200.html, Retrieved from; Bennett, A., The post-subcultural turn: Some reflections 10 years on (2011) Journal of Youth Studies, 14, pp. 493-506; Bennett, A., Hodkinson, P., (2012) Ageing and youth cultures: Music, style and identity, , London, England, Berg, (Eds; Bennett, G., Henson, R., Zhang, J., Generation Y’s perceptions of the action sports industry segment (2003) Journal of Sport Management, 17, pp. 95-115; Bennett, G., Lachowetz, T., Marketing to lifestyles: Action sports and Generation Y (2004) Sports Marketing Quarterly, 13. , 329–243; Bennett, G., Sagas, M., Dees, M., Media preferences of action sports consumers: Differences between Generation X and Y (2006) Sport Marketing Quarterly, 15, pp. 40-49; Bialik, C., NBC’s bid to woo young to Olympics (2002) Media Life Magazine, , http://www.medialifemagazine.com:8080/news2002/feb02/feb04/5_fri/news3friday.html, February, 3, Retrieved from; Billings, A., (2008) Olympic media: Inside the biggest show on television, , London, England, Routledge; Billings, A., (2011) Sports media: Transformation, integration, consumption, , New York, NY, Routledge; Booth, D., (Re)reading the Surfers’ bible: The affect of tracks continuum (2008) Journal of Media and Cultural Studies, 22, pp. 17-35; Bridges, P., Interview: Terje Haakonsen talks the arctic challenge 2014, the Olympics, and riding switch at the Mt.

Major investigations can also affect how reporters in the same outlet think about an issue in the news. The present study examines intramedia and intermedia agenda-setting effects in the context of sport, drawing on allegations of a state-sponsored doping program in Russian athletics. In May 2016, Dr. Grigory Rodchenkov, a former doping official in Russia, described the program to reporters at the New York Times, and the ensuing front-page story impacted coverage both internally and externally. The current study considers the implications of these effects for sports journalism and individual athletes. © The Author(s) 2018.","doping; intermedia agenda-setting; intramedia agenda-setting; journalism; Olympics",,,,,,,,,"An, S.-K., Gower, K.K., How do the news media frame crises?

The purpose of this study is to investigate the relationships between perceived severity, athlete endorser credibility (i.e., incompetence, untrustworthiness), and attitudes towards endorsed and competing brands. To enhance theoretical understanding of the phenomenon, the moderating role of consumer knowledge was also tested. Participants were recruited from Amazon Mechanical Turk (N = 339). A multigroup structural equation model was employed to test the hypothesized model. Results indicated that the severity of an ARC is associated with the perceived incompetence and untrustworthiness of focal athletes. Perceived incompetence is associated with negative evaluation of an endorsed brand. Furthermore, this impact is significantly stronger for consumers with greater knowledge of the athletes than those who are less knowledgeable. Interestingly, competitor brands received negative impact indirectly from the athlete endorsers’ incompetence. This spillover effect is also manifested differently depending on the level of consumer knowledge. © The Author(s) 2018.","athlete transgression; consumer knowledge; endorsement; memory; negative publicity",,,,,,,,,"Ahluwalia, R., Burnkrant, R.E., Unnava, H.R., Consumer response to negative publicity: The moderating role of commitment (2000) Journal of Marketing Research, 37, pp. 203-214; Alba, J., Hutchinson, J., Dimensions of consumer expertise (1987) Journal of Consumer research, 13, pp. 411-454; Amos, C., Holmes, G., Strutton, D., Exploring the relationship between celebrity endorser effects and advertising effectiveness: A quantitative synthesis of effect size (2008) International Journal of Advertising, 27, pp. 209-234; Anderson, J.R., A spreading activation theory of memory (1983) Journal of Verbal Learning and Verbal Behavior, 22, pp. 261-295; Badenhausen, K., The 2017 NBA All-Stars: Players who earn the most money from endorsements (2017) Forbes, , https://www.forbes.com/sites/kurtbadenhausen/2017/02/19/the-nba-all-stars-2017-players-that-earn-the-most-money-from-endorsements/#3b1040f78f66, Retrieved from; Bagozzi, R., Yi, Y., On the use of structural equation models in experimental designs (1989) Journal of Marketing Research, 26, pp. 271-284; Bie, B., Billings, A.C., Too good to be true?

More specifically, it examines the discourse in Canadian newspaper coverage of the 2010 Vancouver Olympic Games surrounding funding for elite athletes. The article first provides an overview of government funding support for elite athletes in Canada and then reviews relevant literature on media framing theory. Methods are discussed, followed by a summary of the frames found in the data analysis process, which examines frames across two distinct time periods—a period leading up to the Games where many stakeholders worried about the ability of Canadian athletes to perform for the host country and the period during and following the Games (where Canadian athletes achieved unprecedented success in winning medals). Several frames emerged from the media coverage regarding the issue of federal government funds for elite athletes over the periods before and during/after the 2010 Olympic Games. Through examining the frequencies of particular frames, we find that three frames—medal performance and national pride, diversified funding approaches, and sport participation and health benefits—were present in both pre-Olympics and during/post-Olympics periods examined, but the salience of the three frames varied between the time periods. © The Author(s) 2018.","government funding; medal count; media frames; national pride; Olympics",,,,,,"Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada, SSHRC","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This research was supported by the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada.",,"Altheide, D.L., (1996) Qualitative media analysis, , Thousand Oaks, CA, Sage; Anderson, B., (1983) Imagined communities: Reflections on the origin and spread of nationalism, , London, England, Verso; Armenakyan, A., Heslop, L.A., Nadeau, J., O’Reilly, N., Lu, I.R., Does hosting the Olympic Games matter?

When a news article presented the drug scandal as due to an uncontrollable cause (e.g., taking a medication to relieve a health problem), low sensation seekers had more negative attitudes and were more in favor of punishment than high sensation seekers. Attributions and sympathy were found to be mediators of the interaction effects of controllable versus uncontrollable messages and SS on punitive opinions.

After receiving criticism for only suspending Rice for two games, the attacks against the NFL and Goodell substantially increased when TMZ released a previously unseen video of Rice knocking out his then-fiancée Janay Palmer in a Revel Casino elevator. Facing these new attacks, Goodell relied on a separation strategy that included acknowledging the NFL had a domestic violence problem, shifting the blame to Rice, and highlighting the NFL’s new domestic violence policy which was the most stringent in professional sports. Goodell also used mortification to enhance his separation strategy to suggest that he was responsible for the insufficient punishment of Rice, which shifted the blame to Goodell and away from the NFL product and NFL owners. Unlike other CEOs who only gain notoriety during an organizational crisis, Goodell was already disliked by players and the public prior to the Rice scandal, which may have enhanced his attempts to shield the league from the scandal. Implications are drawn concerning how the public’s perception of an executive can influence the effectiveness of image repair discourse and how a separation strategy can bolster an organization’s defense. © The Author(s) 2018.","domestic violence; image repair; organizational crisis communication; Roger Goodell; separation strategy",,,,,,,,,"Armour, N., NFL gets it right at last: Other sports must follow suit to fight domestic violence (2014) USA Today, p.

Applying social identity theory and self-categorization theory, this study content analyzed a total of 45 prime time broadcast hours of Australia’s Seven Network’s coverage of the Rio Games. Although the majority of top 20 most-mentioned athletes were Australian, non-Australian athletes were mentioned more frequently regarding total name mentions. Moreover, Australian athletes and non-Australian athletes were described in significantly different manners when ascribing reasons for athletic success and failure. This study contributed to the literature by uncovering how in-group members were portrayed in the Australian sports context while also providing insight into how consumers’ media consumption could potentially affect how the network broadcast the Olympics from a nationally partisan perspective. © The Author(s) 2018.","Australia;

Particular attention has been given to conceptual metaphors, which are seen as essential tools for individuals to interpret and process various ideas and experiences. Within the milieu of metaphorical speech, metaphors of war have frequently been applied across a range of domains including politics, business, and sport. Within the sporting context, the notion of ‘Sport is War’ has been discussed in relation to various football codes, baseball, and tennis. In this article, we examine this metaphor in relation to professional stage-race cycling, a sport known for its combative, tactical, and physically demanding nature. We focus specifically on cycling commentary of the 2016 Tour de France—thus recalibrating the metaphor as ‘Cycling is War.’ Our findings show that war metaphors are prevalent in cycling commentary and are particularly useful in highlighting aspects of the sport inclusive of competition, strategy, power, teamwork, and sportsmanship.

Specifically, I illuminate the ways the tropes of authority and discipline converged to fashion a rhetorical site of absolute professionalism that profoundly altered understandings of race, masculinity, and power. Stern’s prepared remarks and verbal exchanges with reporters, I contend, invite a reconsideration that examines more closely the cocktail of violence, authority, professionalism, and genuine moral struggle that plays out within the text. If that cocktail was tinged with putative racism and masculine domination, Stern’s presser (i.e., the full press conference) challenges scholars of sport to reflect upon the complex affective dynamics of institutional leadership and the obligations of professionalism, dynamics overlooked in recent analyses of the brawl and its aftermath. These dynamics present a compelling heuristic with which to “work through” our social anxiety over morality and sports. © The Author(s) 2017.","affect; authority; professionalism; race; violence",,,,,,,,,"Abrams, J., (2012) The malice at the Palace: An oral history of the scariest moment in NBA history, , http://grantland.com/features/an-oral-history-malice-palace/, Retrieved from; Ahmed, S., (2004) The cultural politics of emotion, , New York, NY, Routledge; Aldridge, D., Knockout blow; In melee’s wake, Indiana’s Artest banned for season (2004) The Philadelphia Inquirer, p.

In an increasingly cluttered and complex scenario where pay-TV giants Sky and BT hold a plethora of top-tier rights and BBC Scotland and STV cannot fit more sport into their schedules, BBC ALBA serves Gaelic-speaking and national audiences with a regular diet of quality sports programming. Beyond being instrumental to filling schedules, sports content has been a gateway for Gaelic, a key driver of BBC ALBA’s investment in the creative sector and a contributor to the development of grassroots sport in Scotland. However, the financial situation under which the channel operates makes it very difficult to sustain and improve its current position. This case study demonstrates that sport broadcasting offers genuine opportunities to maintain linguistic and cultural diversity in small nations, even in a context characterized by escalating competition, dwindling resources, and the proliferation of multiple viewing portals. © The Author(s) 2018.","BBC ALBA; diversity; Gaelic; Scotland; sport",,,,,,,,,"Azurmendi, A., Reforms to the European regional minority-language television corporations in the current context of crisis (2013) Revista Latina de Comunicación Social, 68, pp. 355-382; (2009) Performance, partnerships and future strategy, , London, England, BBC Trust; (2016) BBC Scotland annual review 2015/16, , London, England, British Broadcasting Corporation; Boyle, R., No longer the crown jewels of sport?

I explain that these discourses are contexts in which multiple actors (journalists, scientists, athletes, and sports organizations) struggle to represent the material complexities of CTE through competing ways of knowing. My analysis reveals two tensions underlying debates about sport-related traumatic brain injury. First, my examination reveals discursive clashes between emotionally charged representations of CTE as an urgent public health problem and commentary cautioning audiences about the scientific uncertainty surrounding CTE. I illuminate how, in the face of this uncertainty, scientific conclusiveness remains privileged as the basis for meaningful action to improve athletes’ health. Second, inconsistencies across representations I examined illustrate how CTE defies a straightforward material-semiotic divide. These contradictions demonstrate how the materialities of CTE exceed the medico-scientific and lay discourses through which the condition is commonly known. I argue that such limitations should not enable stakeholders to overlook calls for drastic changes to how sports are played or deflect questions about how sports violence impacts athletes’ lives. Instead, this level of uncertainty should accelerate (rather than delay) challenges to socially acceptable levels of sports violence. © The Author(s) 2018.","chronic traumatic encephalopathy; concussion; media discourse; neuroscience; traumatic brain injury",,,,,,,,,"(2018) Dr. Javier Cardenas on Twitter: New study that associates sub-concussive hits with CTE is very important, but it doesn’t change my view on the age in which an athlete begins to play football or, , https://twitter.com/theconcussiondr/status/954450985979600896, Retrieved January 19, 2018, from, …; Adelson, E., Setting the record straight on CTE (2017) Yahoo!

Using a critical discourse analysis (CDA), we explain how popular media presents concussions in ways that are informative but often avoid a more politicized discussion of the athlete as a manual worker whose body succumbs to use and abuse of sport. We found two recurring themes in the North American popular press, including a tendency to (1) rely on a trope of “millionaires-versus-billionaires” to explain (and minimize) recent labor lockouts in the NFL and NHL and (2) shift focus on league deniability to athletes’ self-responsibility in the concussion “crisis.” Despite the urgency in which sports concussions and brain injuries have been reported in recent years, the two narratives work to discourage readers from recognizing how such health issues arise under specific relations of production, and that an athlete is a particular type of worker whose body is subjected to decline and disposability like so many other bodies under late capitalism. As we argue, working conditions are inseparable from concussions in professional sports, a phenomenon that requires further development within the popular press. © The Author(s) 2017.","brain injury; concussions; labor; National Football League; National Hockey League",,,,,,,"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This research was made possible by the University of Lethbridge Research Fund.",,"Bairner, A., Back to basics: Class, social theory, and sport (2007) Sociology of Sport Journal, 24, pp. 20-36; Barzilai, P., Brady, E., Knee injuries worry NFL players more than concussions (2014) USA Today, , https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/2014/01/27/nfl-players-injury-survey-knee-head-concussions/4918341/, January, 27, Retrieved from; Battista, J., A player’s concussion, a family’s ordeal (2012) The New York Times, , http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/16/sports/football/former-nfl-player-mitch-white-learns-to-adjust-to-postconcussion-life.html?%20pagewanted=all&_r=0, Retrieved from; Beamish, R., Karl Marx’s enduring legacy for the sociology of sport (2002) Theory, sport and society, pp. 25-40. , Maguire J., Young K., (eds), Amsterdam, the Netherlands, JAI, (Eds.), (., –; Beamish, R., Marxism, alienation and Coubertin’s Olympic project (2009) Marxism, cultural studies and sport, pp. 88-105. , Carrington B., McDonald’s I., (eds), New York, NY, Routledge, (Eds.), (., –; Belson, K., Roger Goodell insists football is safe: “There’s risk in life” (2016) The New York Times, , http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/06/sports/football/roger-goodell-insists-football-is-safe-theres-risk-in-life.html?_r=1, a, February 5, Retrieved from; Belson, K., A.J.

These Games were remarkable in suddenly becoming a key subject for global media when North Korea unexpectedly announced its intention to participate barely a month before the opening ceremony. There followed an extraordinary turn of events, including revived talks between the Koreas and a meeting between South Korean President Moon Jae-in and North Korean Leader Kim Jong-un, the last-minute formation of a unified women’s ice hockey team, Korean athletes marching under a unification flag, and an unprecedented summit in Singapore involving U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-Un. These developments raise critical questions regarding sport, diplomacy, media, and geopolitics. A discursive exploration is conducted of the main thematic mediated currents as the Games passed from being in prospect to taking place to being appraised in rapid retrospect. It is argued that each sport event of this kind has much in common with others but also displays unique characteristics that can never be replicated in space or time. It seeks to derive lessons for communication and sport analysis from PyeongChang 2018 alongside sporting and other cultural events that have already happened and are yet to be conceived. © The Author(s) 2018.","discourse; media; mega-events; politics; sport diplomacy",,,,,,,,,"(2018) North Korea’s Kim Jong-Un and Donald Trump Sign Denuclearisation Agreement in Singapore, , http://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-06-12/donald-trump-kim-jong-un-singapore-summit/9859210, June 13, Retrieved from; (2018) Winter Olympics: Two Koreas unite in women’s ice hockey, but language differences pose problems, , http://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-02-06/winter-olympics-language-problems-unified-korea-ice-hockey-team/9399410, (b, February 6).

Footballers are frequently the target or subject of such abuse and occasionally the source of it. In this context, this article explores and critically assesses the response of English football’s institutions, organisations, and clubs to the problem of racism on social media. Its findings are based on interviews with key officials from the Professional Footballers’ Association and Kick It Out and with safeguarding and media officers from football clubs across the English Premier League and English Football League. It concludes there are a number of systematic failings undermining or hindering football’s attempts to address this issue including poor coordination, a lack of clear guidelines, ad hoc educational provision, a shortage of resources, and a culture of secrecy at many clubs. This article concludes with some recommendations about how these weaknesses may start to be improved. © The Author(s) 2017.","football; racism; social media; Twitter; whiteness",,,,,,,,,"Bennett, H., Jönsson, A., Klick it out: Tackling online discrimination in football (2017) Sport and discrimination, pp. 203-214. , Kilvington D., Price J., (eds), London, England, Routledge, (Eds.), (., –; Bland, A., FIFA says it’s solved racism in football—But it’s nowhere near (2016) The Guardian, , https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/26/fifa-anti-racism-football-taskforce-solved-nowhere-near, Retrieved from; Bonilla-Silva, E., (2003) Racism without racists: Color-blind racism and the persistence of racial inequality in the United States, , Lanham, MD, Rowman & Littlefield; Boyd, D., White flight in networked publics?

In 2009, medical research linking hits to the head and the Alzheimer’s-like condition known as chronic traumatic encephalopathy prompted the league to institute rule changes to limit violent tackles. Harrison was repeatedly punished by the league office and criticized by sports media outlets for his violent tackles and recalcitrant attitude. Guiding both the discipline and media coverage of Harrison are narratives rooted in a neoliberal logic situating the existence of and responsibility for football violence within the individual decisions of football players. Intensifying these narratives is the NFL and its media partners’ invocation of discourses of Black criminality to construct the most damaging moments of football violence as unsanctioned acts that operate “outside the game.” This invocation serves to place the authority over the judgment and legitimation of football violence within the White corporate morality of the league’s offices and its media partners, allowing them to preserve the sport’s central place in producing and maintaining dominant American masculinities through football violence while casting off the responsibility for the consequences of that violence to the footballing bodies that administer and receive it. © The Author(s) 2017.","concussions; football; masculinity; race; violence",,,,,,,,,"Anderson, E., Kian, E.M., Examining media contestation of masculinity and head trauma in the National Football League (2012) Men and Masculinities, 15, pp. 152-173; Anderson, L.C., Rainey, A.A., Exploring the relationship between sports fandom and the Black criminal stereotype (2017) Communication and Sport, 6, pp. 263-282; Andrews, V.L., Black bodies—White control: The contested terrain of sportsmanlike conduct (1996) Journal of African American Men, 2, pp. 33-59; Belson, K., For Ravens’ John Urschel, playing in the N.F.L. no longer adds up (2017) New York Times, , www.nytimes.com, October, 24, Retrieved from; Benson, P., Big football: Corporate social responsibility and the culture and color of injury in America’s most popular sport (2017) Journal of Sport and Social Issue, 41, pp. 307-334; Birrell, S., McDonald, M.G., (2000) Reading sport: Critical essays on power and representation, , Lebanon, NH, UPNE, (Eds; Bloom, E., Memo to Harrison: Go ahead and quit the NFL (2010) The Orange Country Register, , www.ocregister.com, October, 22, Retrieved from; Borges, R., James Harrison stupidly has guns blazing (2011) Boston Herald, , www.bostonherald.com, July, 14, Retrieved from; Brinson, W., James Harrison targeted for being James Harrison (2011) CBS Sports, , www.cbssports.com, July, 13, Retrieved from; Brooks, M., James Harrison’s incendiary comments drawing ire of fellow NFL players (2011) The Early Lead, , www.washingtonpost.com, July, 13, Retrieved from; Broussard, C., LeBron: No football in my house (2014) ESPN, , www.espn.com, November, 13, Retrieved from; Burton, N., NFL great Bettis disappointed in James Harrison’s controversial comments (2011) The Root, , www.theroot.com, July, 14, Retrieved from; Butterworth, M.L., Militarism and memorializing at the Pro Football Hall of Fame (2012) Communication and Critical/ Cultural Studies, 9, pp. 241-258; Butterworth, M.L., Moskal, S.D., American football, flags, and “fun”: The bell helicopter armed forces bowl and the rhetorical production of militarism (2009) Communication, Culture & Critique, 2, pp. 411-433; Byrne, K.J., Harrison is wrong: Roethlisberger, Manning are equals (2011) Sports Illustrated, , www.si.com, July, 20, Retrieved from; Chase, C., NFL players speak out on the NFL’s awful, new dangerous hit rule (2010) Yahoo!

We locate Li Na as representative of a growing class of Chinese celebrities who display both extraordinary popularity and enormous marketability. At the same time, Li Na’s noted “rebelliousness”—most especially her “fiery” personality and overt public repudiation of the Chinese communist state—has made her a deeply politicized if not polarizing figure. In this study, we position Li Na as a symbolic body characterized by professionalism, individualism, and commercialism within Chinese media. Further, we investigate the representation, mediation, and consumption of her unique celebrity identity and the cultural politics of the danfei (the “fly solo”) policy in resonance to the decentralization of state power in China. We conclude by suggesting that Li Na’s rebelliousness symbolizes the core values of a growing consensus for neoliberalism in China; that is, it is her rejection of being Chinese (state) that reestablishes herself as Chinese (autonomous), which signifies fundamental social transitions in China intertwined with the embracement of the global economy and a reimagination of the nation. © The Author(s) 2017.","Chinese national identity; danfei; globalization; neoliberalism; sport celebrity",,,,,,,,,"Andrews, D.L., Jackson, S.J., (2001) Sport stars: The cultural politics of sport celebrity, , London, England, Routledge; Andrews, D.L., Ritzer, G., The grobal in the sporting glocal (2007) Global Networks, 7, pp. 135-153; Arrighi, G., (2007) Adam smith in Beijing, , London, England, Verso; Bairner, A., (2001) Sport, nationalism, and globalization: European and North American perspectives, , Albany, NY, SUNY Press; Beech, H., China’s tennis champion serves up a problem for its rulers (2014) Time, , http://time.com/2246/li-na-xu-zhiyong-prison-australianopen/, January, 28, Retrieved from; Boorstin, D.J., From hero to celebrity: The human pseudo-event (2006) The celebrity culture reader, pp. 72-90. , Marshall P.D., (ed), New York, NY, Routledge, (Ed.), (., –; Borromeo, E.L., Chinese tennis star Li Na is world’s richest retired female athlete (2016) Yibada, , http://en.yibada.com/articles/113808/20160404/chinese-tennis-star-li-na-world-s-richest-retired-female.htm, Retrieved from; Braudy, L., (1997) The frenzy of renown: Fame and its history, , 2nd ed, New York, NY, Vintage; Brislin, R.W., Back-translation for cross-cultural research (1970) Journal of Cross-Cultural Psychology, 1, pp. 185-216; Brownell, S., (1995) Training the body for China: Sports in the moral order of the people’s republic, , Chicago, IL, University of Chicago Press; Brownell, S., (2008) Beijing’s games: What the Olympics mean to China, , Lanham, MD, Rowman & Littlefield; Callinicos, A., Does capitalism need the state system?

It uses the 2015 FIFA Women’s World Cup (WWC) as a case study to examine the ways in which fans at a women’s sport event express their fandom through images and to consider the social and political dimensions of using Instagram for promoting women’s sport. Instagram pictures containing the event-related hashtags #FIFAWWC, #LiveYourGoals, #SheBelieves, and #CanadaRed were collected over the tournament duration. From a content analysis of 3,605 images, the authors argue that visual networked platforms are facilitating online communication conventions within sport fan communities that function as forms of social presence to legitimate women’s participation as fans and generate visibility for women’s sport. By demonstrating that the production and sharing of visual content related to sport events have become important features of the contemporary sport fan experience, this article advocates for greater recognition of social media practices alongside conventional measures of sport fan engagement. © The Author(s) 2019.","FIFA Women’s World Cup; Instagram; selfie; social media; sport fans",,,,,,,,,"Antunovic, D., Hardin, M., Women and the blogosphere: Exploring feminist approaches to sport (2015) International Review for the Sociology of Sport, 50, pp. 661-677; Antunovic, D., Linden, A., Disrupting dominant discourses: #HERESPROOF of interest in women’s sports (2015) Feminist Media Studies, 15, pp. 157-159; Billings, A., Qiao, F., Conlin, L., Nie, T., Permanently desiring the temporary?

The study is based on a netnographic and qualitative methodology. Theoretically, it considers a women’s online forum for PIEDs and analyzes it as a community of practice (CofP) and a spatiality in which gender, bodies, and side effects are discussed and negotiated. The results show that although the women’s forum provides a space for women to share their own unique experiences, there is a limit to the extent to which the discussions mirror the experiences and experimentations of women. Instead, discussions are often dominated by men’s voices/experiences. This has two main implications. Firstly, the prevalence of men’s voices can block the development of a women’s CofP. Symbolically, men engage in a sort of cultural manspreading by encroaching on the women’s forum space. Secondly, it has implications for women’s PIED use and use practices. Women seeking out advice or the experiences of other women must navigate through and around men’s contributions. © The Author(s) 2019.","communication; community of practice; fitness doping; gender; online forum",,,,,,,,,"Adler, P.A., Adler, P., The cyber worlds of self-injurers: Deviant communities, relationships, and selves (2011) Symbolic Interaction, 3, pp. 33-56; Anderson-Levitt, K., Ethnography (2006) Handbook of complementary methods in education research, pp. 279-296. , Green J., Camilli G., Elmore P., (eds), Lawrence Erlbaum, (Eds.), (., –; Andreasson, J., Henning, A., Glocal fitness doping: Policy, practice and prevention in the United States and Sweden 103–110 (2019) Performance Enhancement & Health, 6. , http://doi.org/10.1016/j.peh.2018.11.001; Andreasson, J., Johansson, T., (2014) The global gym: Gender, health and pedagogies, , Palgrave Macmillan; Andreasson, J., Johansson, T., Online doping: The new self-help culture of ethnopharmacology (2016) Sport in Society: Cultures, Commerce, Media, Politics, 19, pp. 957-972; Andreasson, J., Johansson, T., Doped manhood.

Research presented here asks to what extent attempts at politicization have prevailed with regard to the 2018 FIFA World Cup in Russia. The question is addressed with a quantitative content analysis of English Twitter messages (N = 14,366,447) surrounding the Russian World Cup. The analysis points to several attempts to politicize the event, however with limited resonance. Among political tweets, those that criticize the suppression of homosexuals in Russia gained most but only short-lived attention. Sentiment analyses further indicate that negative messages declined in the course of the World Cup; hence, the event might have distracted audiences from political issues and created a “feel-good effect.” The 2018 World Cup appeared as a “normal” mega sport event on Twitter. © The Author(s) 2019.","mega sport events; politicization; Russia; sentiment analysis; soft power; Twitter data; World Cup",,,,,,,,,"Alekseyeva, A., Sochi 2014 and the rhetoric of a new Russia: Image construction through mega-events (2014) East European Politics, 30, pp. 158-174; Armstrong, G., Giulianotti, R., Hobbs, D., (2016) Policing the 2012 London Olympics: Legacy and social exclusion, , Routledge; Atefeh, F., Khreich, W., A survey of techniques for event detection in twitter (2015) Computational Intelligence, 31, pp. 132-164; Banks, M., MEPs urge EU countries to boycott World Cup (2018) The Parliament Magazine, , www.theparliamentmagazine.eu/articles/news/meps-urge-eu-countries-boycott-world-cup, Retrieved November 13, 2019, from; Bennett, W.L., Segerberg, A., (2013) The logic of connective action: Digital media and the personalization of contentious politics, , Cambridge University Press; Boyd, D., Golder, S., Lotan, G., (2010) Tweet, tweet, retweet: Conversational aspects of retweeting on Twitter, , https://www.danah.org/papers/TweetTweetRetweet.pdf, Retrieved November 13, 2019, from; Brannagan, P.M., Giulianotti, R., Soft power and soft disempowerment: Qatar, global sport and football’s 2022 World Cup finals (2015) Leisure Studies, 34, pp. 703-719; Braun, V., Clarke, V., Using thematic analysis in psychology (2006) Qualitative Research in Psychology, 3, pp. 77-101; Brown, N.A., Brown, K.A., Billings, A.C., May no act of ours bring shame”: Fan-enacted crisis communication surrounding the Penn state sex abuse scandal (2015) Communication & Sport, 3, pp. 288-311; Brownell, S., Human rights and the Beijing Olympics: Imagined global community and the transnational public sphere (2012) British Journal of Sociology, 63, pp. 306-327; Bruns, A., Burgess, J.E., (2011) The use of Twitter hashtags in the formation of ad hoc publics, , http://snurb.info/files/2011/The%20Use%20of%20Twitter%20Hashtags%20in%20the%20Formation%20of%20Ad%20Hoc%20Publics%20(final).pdf, Retrieved November 13, 2019, from; Bruns, A., Highfield, T., Burgess, J., The Arab spring and its social media audiences: English and Arabic Twitter users and their networks (2013) American Behavioral Scientist, 57, pp. 871-898; Bruns, A., Moe, H., Structural layers of communication on Twitter (2014) Twitter and society, pp. 15-28. , Weller K., Bruns A., Burgess J., Mahrt M., Puschmann C., (eds), Bern, Peter Lang, (Eds.), (., –; Buarque, D., One country, two cups: The international image of Brazil in 1950 and 2014 (2015) International Journal of Communication, 9, pp. 1300-1318; David, M., EU-Russia relations: Effects of the 2014 Ukraine crisis (2014) Russian Analytical Digest, 158, pp. 5-8; Domjan, P., Stone, M., A comparative study of resource nationalism in Russia and Kazakhstan 2004-2008 (2010) Europe-Asia Studies, 62, pp. 35-62; Elling, A., Van Hilvoorde, I., Van Den Dool, R., Creating or awakening national pride through sporting success: A longitudinal study on macro effects in the Netherlands (2014) International Review for the Sociology of Sport, 49, pp. 129-151; Fan, Y., Soft power: Power of attraction or confusion?

Approaching the topic to understand whether organizational identification has similar positive outcomes to basking in reflected glory, this study specifically measures whether Houston residents were able to cope better and whether their meaning in life increased. After distributing surveys to Houston residents who reported being impacted by the hurricane, the findings indicated stronger organizational identification with the Houston Astros led to stronger reflected glory. Additionally, fans who felt reflected glory were more able to cope with tragedy, and self-efficacy toward overcoming the disaster partially contributed to this relationship. Lastly, fans who coped with the disaster felt a greater meaning in life. Theoretically, our study makes new connections between organizational identity and reflected glory, while tying reflected glory to coping outcomes.

This study looks at three diplomatically important components of the opening and closing ceremonies: artistic performance, a parade of nations, and the presence of world leaders. The media coverage of these components reveals that (1) the dissemination of a message of peace and unity, (2) the representation of unified Korean identity and Korean cultural heritage, and (3) the communication and negotiation between the high-level state officials are the three most visible acts of diplomacy at these celebrational occasions of the 2018 PyeongChang Winter Olympics. In effect, the combination of cultural diplomacy, sport diplomacy, and interstate diplomacy is actively at work during these ritualistic events. Therefore, the Olympic ceremonies present a global podium where dynamic and dramatic games of diplomacy take place. © The Author(s) 2019.","global diplomacy framework; media event; Pyeongchang 2018; sport diplomacy; Winter Olympics",,,,,,,,,"Acuto, M., World politics by other means?

In order to explain this “racial contradiction,” this study analyzes how an athlete's response strategy and the amount of sports news consumed by participants could impact differences in the perceptions of athletes of different races. A between-subjects, double-blind experiment was conducted among 464 participants to examine how an athlete’s race, an athlete’s chosen response strategy, and participants’ level of sports news consumption affect the perception of athletes accused of criminal allegations. Results show that while low sports news consumers did not differ in their perception of an athlete regarding whether he was Black or White, high sports news consumers perceived Black athletes more positively than White athletes, supporting the “racial contradiction.” Also, results showed that while participants who were low sports news consumers accepted the White athlete’s use of denial more than that of the Black athlete, participants who were high sports news consumers accepted the Black athlete’s use of denial more than that of the White athlete. © The Author(s) 2019.","criminal transgressions; experiment; racial bias; sports image repair",,,,,,,,,"Anderson, L., Raney, A., Exploring the relationship between sports fandom and the black criminal stereotype (2018) Communication and Sport, 6, pp. 263-282; Benoit, W., Hugh grant’s image restoration discourse: An actor apologizes (1997) Communication Quarterly, 45, pp. 251-267; Benoit, W., (2015) Accounts, excuses and apologies, , 2nd ed, Albany, State University of New York Press; Benoit, W., Effects of image repair strategies (2016) Putting image repair to the test: Quantitative applications of image restoration theory, pp. 7-28. , Blaney J.R., (ed), Lanham, MD, Lexington, (Ed.), (., –; Benoit, W., Hanczor, R., The Tonya Harding controversy: An analysis of image restoration strategies (1994) Communication Quarterly, 42, pp. 416-433; Billings, A., Portraying Tiger Woods: Characterizations of a “Black” athlete in a “White” sport (2003) The Howard Journal of Communication, 14, pp. 29-37; Billings, A., Depicting the quarterback in black and white: A content analysis of college and professional football broadcast commentary (2004) The Howard Journal of Communication, 15, pp. 201-210; Billings, A., Brown, K., Brown-Devlin, N., Sports draped in the American flag: Impact of the 2014 Winter Olympic telecast on nationalized attitudes (2015) Mass Communication and Society, 18, pp. 377-398; Billings, A., Butterworth, M., Turman, P., (2018) Communication and sport: Surveying the field, , 3rd ed, Thousand Oaks, CA, Sage; Bodenhausen, G., Schwarz, N., Bless, H., Wanke, M., Effects of atypical exemplars on racial beliefs: Enlightened racism or generalized appraisals?

We collected data from 323 social media users who have employed hashtags to exchange sports-related information during the past 12 months. The structural equation modeling confirmed affect, perceived usefulness, perceived reciprocity, and social factors as motivators of the intention to share information. Other motivators, including habit and facilitating conditions, function as predictors of actual hashtags posting among sport fans. In deriving empirical evidence and novel insights into the role of hashtags, this research elevated our understanding of information circulation among sport fans over social media and serves as a foundation for inquiries into hashtag adoption in sport domains. © The Author(s) 2019.","fans behavior; hashtags; information-sharing; social media; theory of interpersonal behavior",,,,,,,,,"Aarts, H., Paulussen, T., Schaalma, H., Physical exercise habit: On the conceptualization and formation of habitual health behaviours (1997) Health Education Research, 12, pp. 363-374; Abeza, G., O’Reilly, N., Seguin, B., Nzindukiyimana, O., Social media as a relationship marketing tool in professional sport: A netnographical exploration (2017) International Journal of Sport Communication, 10, pp. 325-358; Adedoyin-Olowe, M., Gaber, M.M., Dancausa, C.M., Stahl, F., Gomes, J.B., A rule dynamics approach to event detection in twitter with its application to sports and politics (2016) Expert Systems With Applications, 55, pp. 351-360; Adedoyin-Olowe, M., Gaber, M.M., Dancausa, C.M., Stahl, F., Extraction of unexpected rules from twitter hashtags and its application to sport events (2014) Proceeding of the 13th international conference on machine learning and applications, pp. 207-212. , Chen X., Qu G., Angelov P., Ferri C., Lai J., Wani M., (eds), December, Detroit, MI, IEEE, (,)., (Eds.), (., –; Ajzen, I., The theory of planned behavior (1991) Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes, 50, pp. 179-211; Albarracín, D., Sunderrajan, A., Dai, W., Action, inaction, and actionability: Definitions and implications for communications and interventions to change behaviors (2018) Nebraska Symposium on Motivation, pp. 75-99. , Cham, Springer, (. 65,., –; Asch, S.E., Effects of group pressure upon the modification and distortion of judgments (1951) Groups, leadership and men, pp. 177-190. , Guetzkow H., (ed), Pittsburgh, PA, Carnegie, (Ed.), (., –; Babiak, K., Mills, B., Tainsky, S., Juravich, M., An investigation into professional athlete philanthropy: Why charity is part of the game (2012) Journal of Sport Management, 26, pp. 159-176; Bamberg, S., Schmidt, P., Incentives, morality, or habit?

As such, hashtags can aid in the formation of a team’s online brand community and can be useful to understand and target key segments of users. In this research, an examination of the Toronto Raptors’ #WeTheNorth campaign in the National Basketball Association was engendered to highlight (a) the types of communication networks formed through the use of the hashtag and (b) the types of segments that are derived from the hashtag (as well as their characteristics).

Based on the conversation analytic study of video recordings from Finnish and Swedish men’s (semi)professional ice hockey leagues, this article posits that complaints are formulated within assessment sequences and are made hearable as complaints through implicit and explicit verbal and bodily cues. This article also suggests that while referees are the non-present third party in the PGPC, the design of the complaints provides opportunities and places obligations on the participants present in the PGPC (media representatives, game officials, and the opposing coach) to (dis)align with the complainer. Finally, this article reveals a tension between the normative expectations of the coaches to stand by their team, which may include criticizing referees, while respecting referees as guardians of sporting ethics and acknowledging the increased demands for media attention. © The Author(s) 2019.","complaints; conversation analysis; emotion; postgame press conference; recipient design; referees",,,,,,,,,"Antaki, C., (1994) Explaining and arguing: The social organization of accounts, , London, England, Sage; Bell, T.R., Hartman, K.L., Stealing thunder through social media: The framing of Maria Sharapova’s drug suspension (2018) International Journal of Sport Communication, 11, pp. 369-388; Caldwell, D., Working your words”: Appraisal in the AFL post-match interview (2009) Australian Review of Applied Linguistics, 32, pp. 1-17; Cranmer, G.A., Buckner, M.M., High school athletes’ relationships with head coaches and team-mates as predictors of their expressions of upward and lateral dissent (2017) Communication Journal, 74, pp. 390-405; Debras, C., The shrug.

To trace the expansion of the independent football magazine market, in-depth interviews were conducted with the editors of eight prestigious projects from seven countries: Howler (United States), Panenka and Líbero (Spain), Mundial (United Kingdom), So Foot (France), 11 Freunde (Germany), Offside (Sweden), and Ballesterer (Austria). Independent football magazines position themselves as part of a journalistic counteroffensive to the metric-driven, routinized, and complacent approach that currently shapes mainstream sports media output. In contrast to the primary orientation of sports journalism towards economic capital, their editorial philosophy is built on three core axes aimed at developing cultural capital: (1) a diverse and multifaceted football agenda that embraces unheard voices and far-reaching issues of a sociocultural, geopolitical, and economic nature; (2) the importance of dedicating time and resources to create a visually distinctive output; and (3) a deliberate emphasis on nostalgia and resistance to the seemingly endless commodification of football. As part of their creative approach, gathering and nourishing a community of readers has been fundamental to the growth and sustainability of those projects. © The Author(s) 2019.","design; diversity; football independent magazines; nostalgia; sports journalism",,,,,,,,,"Wer bin ich?

Results from a survey of collegiate athletes (N = 353) illustrate that it is not only students’ generalized ability to understand health information (health literacy) that determines knowledge of concussion symptoms but also one’s motivation to think deeply about concussion protocols (need for cognition [NFC]). Current results show that NFC mediated the relationship between health literacy and the collegiate athletes’ knowledge of concussion symptoms. Collegiate athletes’ concussion protocols aimed at increasing concussion reportage rates should be multimodal (rather than standardized textual lecture-based approaches) to be better fit individualized approaches to cognitive processing of complex health-related messages and to begin to address the sociocultural contexts and complexities associated with athletes’ stay-on-the-field bias, which makes the burden of behavioral change particularly difficult in concussion education efforts. © The Author(s) 2019.","elaboration likelihood model; health literacy; health message matching; need for cognition; sports-related concussion education",,,,,,,,,"Bakker, A., Persuasive communication about AIDS prevention: Need for cognition determines the impact of message format (1999) AIDS Education and Prevention, 11, pp. 150-162; Baugh, C.M., Kroshus, E., Bourlas, A.P., Perry, K.I., Requiring athletes to acknowledge receipt of concussion-related information and responsibility to report symptoms: A study of the prevalence, variation, and possible improvements (2014) Journal of Law, Medicine and Ethics.

The purpose of this research was to examine how stakeholders’ perceptions of sport-related crises are communicated within the rhetorical arena. This research addresses several lingering questions regarding the influential role of sport identification, fan communication behavior, and social relationships among sports fans in the development of crisis perceptions. The situational crisis communication theory (SCCT) model is extended by applying it to sport crisis and the network perspective. In sum, this sport crisis egocentric discussion network, driven by functional specificity hypothesis, enabled an in-depth investigation into network selection, activation, and influence regarding sports fans’ crisis perceptions, and the significance of identification and the discordant communication exchanged within a sports fan’s personal network. © The Author(s) 2019.","discordant communication; egocentric discussion networks; situational crisis communication theory; sport crisis; sport identification",,,,,,"Graduate School, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This research was funded in part by the Mass Communication & Society Division of the Association for Education in Journalism and Mass Communication (AEJMC), The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Graduate School, and the Margaret Blanchard Dissertation Support Fund.",,"Ahluwalia, R., Burnkrant, R.E., Unnava, H.R., Consumer response to negative publicity: The moderating role of commitment (2000) Journal of Marketing Research, 37, pp. 203-214; Ashforth, B.E., Mael, F., Social identity theory and the organization (1989) Academy of Management Review, 14, pp. 20-39; Avery, E.J., Lariscy, R.W., Kim, S., Hocke, T., A quantitative review of crisis communication research in public relations from 1991 to 2009 (2010) Public Relations Review, 36, pp. 190-192; Bearman, P., Parigi, P., Cloning headless frogs and other important matters: Conversation topics and network structure (2004) Social Forces, 83, pp. 535-557; Bello, J., Rolfe, M., Is influence mightier than selection?

Researchers analyzed social media users’ replies (N = 2,009) to six collegiate student-athletes’ early exit announcements on Twitter and Instagram during the 2018 National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) football season. Results identified four responses to exit announcements: (a) supporting, (b) noting significance, (c) disagreeing, and (d) capitalizing. These reactions varied as a function of fan identification: (a) those who expressed fandom for exited teams supported student-athletes, (b) those who expressed fandom for other teams capitalized on the announcements, and (c) those who expressed no fandom noted the significance of and disagreed with student-athletes. These findings offer unique insights that reinforce and diverge from assertions about fans’ BIRGing and CORFing behaviors. The results also have consequences for how scholars and practitioners come to view the intersections between team/organizational processes, athlete expression, and athlete–fan interaction. © The Author(s) 2019.","BIRGing;

The surveyed journalists represented journalists from national television stations, radio stations, and press and Internet media. Some of them were working simultaneously in various mass media outlets. In-depth interviews were conducted in various locations in Poland in 2018. An analysis of the journalists’ views from 36 semi-structured interviews indicated a general consensus among the surveyed sports journalists, both male and female, on the inferior status of women’s sports and women’s sports coverage, a negation of need to realign the inequitable coverage of women’s sports and the perception that sports are a neutral institution with respect to gender. The investigated female sports journalists presented more negative and straightforward views on women’s sports than their male colleagues. This article also indicates the minority status of female sports journalists in Poland and their process of socialization in the profession; it discusses the first male socializing agents that introduced and influenced the female journalists with respect to sports as factors that may be responsible for the journalists’ biased belief in the subordinate nature of women’s sports in general and their secondary position in sports media. © The Author(s) 2019.","gender equality; Poland; sports journalists; sports media; women’s sports coverage",,,,,,"DM-55","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was supported by Polish Ministry of Sport and Higher Education (Grant DM-55).",,"Billings, A.C., Young, B.D., Comparing flagship news programs: Women’s sport coverage in ESPN’s SportsCenter and FOX Sports 1’s FOX Sports Live (2015) Electronic News, 9, pp. 3-16; Chambers, D., Steiner, L., Fleming, C., (2004) Women and journalism, , London, England, Routledge; Claringbould, I., Knoppers, A., Elling, A., Exclusionary practices in sport journalism (2004) Sex Roles, 51, pp. 709-718; Cooky, C., Messner, M.A., Musto, M., It’s dude time!”: A quarter century of excluding women’s sports in televised news and highlights shows (2015) Communication & Sport, 3, pp. 261-287; Crolley, L., Teso, E., Gendered narratives in Spain: The representation of female athletes in Marca and El Pais (2007) International Review for the Sociology of Sport, 42, pp. 149-166; de Bruin, M., Ross, K., Beyond the body count (2004) Gender and newsroom cultures: Industries at work, , de Bruin M., Ross K., (eds), vii–xii, Cresskill, NY, Hampton Press, (Eds; Dziubiński, Z., Organista, N., Mazur, Z., Still marginalized: Gender inequalities in the largest Polish daily’s sports coverage (2019) Communications, 44, pp. 33-57; Eagleman, A., Constructing gender differences: Newspaper portrayals of male and female gymnasts at the 2012 Olympic Games (2015) Sport in Society: Cultures, Commerce, Media, Politics, 18, pp. 234-247; (2017) Gender Equality Index 2017.

Prior studies have mainly adopted a textual analysis approach in examining this written genre of sports commentary. Working within a media multitasking and technology acceptance paradigm, this study investigated the patterns of, perceptions, and motivations that drive online consumption of live text commentary among football fans. Data were obtained from a survey of 312 Nigerian football fans. Findings showed that Nigerian fans access live text commentary in a supplementary and contemporaneous fashion with television and radio live football broadcasts. It was revealed that fans were more likely to access live text commentary to follow European football league matches than those of the domestic league. However, the local–foreign spectatorship preference margin was found to be minimal when fans follow country-based football matches. Results also established that fans' motivations and perceptions, which were found to be more utilitarian than hedonic in direction, significantly mediate the relationship between actual consumption and intention for future consumption of live text commentary. Implications and contributions of the study's findings were discussed. © The Author(s) 2019.","football spectatorship; Live text commentary; media multitasking; Nigerian fans; second screen; technology acceptance",,,,,,,,,"Adebayo, K.O., Falase, O.S., Akintunde, A., ‘Here, we are all equal!’: Soccer viewing centres and the transformation of age relations among fans in South-Western Nigeria (2017) Soccer & Society, 20, pp. 360-376; Adetunji, A., A discursive construction of teasing in football fandom: The context of the South-Western Nigerian viewing center (2013) Discourse & Society, 24, pp. 147-162; Adeyemi, O., Kola, A., Gone to Stamford Bridge?

The media have covered these stories since the turn of the 20th century. Informed by feminist sport studies literature, this research examines media coverage of women footballers in the United States by conducting a textual analysis of over 100 articles from 1934 to 1979. Journalists who covered women encroaching on conventional men’s space (i.e., American gridirons) simultaneously attempted to demonstrate women’s athleticism and reified dichotomies between feminine and masculine norms and values in U.S. society.

The first is that traditional recommendations for self-defense that advocate combat sports as a means of protection are rooted in a Burkean victimage ritual that places the obligation for the assault on the survivor. The second examines the role that hegemonic masculinity and hierarchy play in perpetuating this system, particularly the ways in which these presumptions empower assailants and disenfranchise survivors as well as enable the combat sports orientation to appear helpless in the face of accusations. The third explores how Burkean notions of action and motion are being used as tools for progressive change by those seeking to refashion the orientation and put the responsibility for the assaults on those at the top of the combat sports hierarchy. © The Author(s) 2019.","combat sports; Kenneth Burke; masculinity; rhetoric; sexual assault",,,,,,,,,"https://www.bullshido.net/athletes-at-riskconvincing-olympic-athletes-to-report-sexual-abuse-misconduct-a-hard-art/, Retrieved from; Axon, R., Armour, N., Olympian brothers sued for sexual assault, negligence by fellow taekwondo athletes (2018) USA Today, , https://www.usatoday.com/, April, 26, Retrieved from, (, a; Axon, R., Armour, N., Athletes outraged as banned taekwondo coach reinstated (2018) USA Today, , https://www.usatoday.com/, August, 17, Retrieved from, (, b; Banim, J., Mugger gets brutal beating after trying to rob UFC star Polyana Viana with cardboard gun (2018) Unilad, , https://www.unilad.co.uk/sport/mugger-gets-brutal-beating-after-trying-to-rob-ufc-star-polyana-viana-with-cardboard-gun/, Retrieved from; Batchelor, A., Sabovic, S., Jiu-jitsu instructor accused of molesting students held without bond (2018) ABC Local 10 News, , https://www.local10.com/, August, 22, Retrieved from; Baxter, K., Judo’s Kayla Harrison finds sanctuary—And perhaps Olympic gold (2012) Los Angeles Times, , http://articles.latimes.com/, April, 26, Retrieved from; (2016) W for Woman, , https://wforwoman.com/content/the-6-best-forms-of-martial-arts-for-women/, March, 11, Retrieved from; Borer, M.I., Schafer, T.S., Culture war confessionals: Conflicting accounts of Christianity, violence, and mixed martial arts (2011) Journal of Media and Religion, 10, pp. 165-184; Brackenridge, C., Harassment, sexual abuse, and safety of the female athlete (2000) The Athletic Woman, 19, pp. 187-198; Brecklin, L.R., Evaluation outcomes of self-defense training for women: A review (2008) Aggression and Violent Behavior, 13, pp. 60-76; Britt, D., Reality self-defense vs. combat sports Combat Network Magazine, , http://www.combatnetworkmagazine.com/2015/02/reality-self-defense-vs-combat-sports.html, Retrieved from; Brookhouse, B., Team Lloyd Irvin crippled by mass exodus of top students after yet another scandal (2013) Bloody Elbow, , https://www.bloodyelbow.com/2013/3/5/4066506/team-lloyd-irvin-sex-abuse-cult-power-medal-chasers-exodus, March, 5, Retrieved from; Burke, K., (1937) Attitudes toward history, , 3rd ed, Berkeley, CA, University of California Press; Burke, K., (1954) Permanence and change, , 3rd ed, Berkeley, CA, University of California Press; Burke, K., (1973) The philosophy of literary form, , 3rd ed, Berkeley, CA, University of California Press; Burke, K., (Nonsymbolic) motion/(symbolic) action (1978) Critical Inquiry, 4, pp. 809-838; Butterworth, M.L., Purifying the body politics: Steroids, Rafael Palmeiro, and the rhetorical cleansing of Major League Baseball (2008) Western Journal of Communication, 72, pp. 145-161; Cahill, A.J., In defense of self-defense (2009) Philosophical Papers, 38, pp. 363-380; Carlson, A.C., Gandhi and the comic frame: “Ad bellum purificandum.

These two groups were girls, aged 8–12, who either (a) enrolled and participated in a sports program or (b) did not enroll in the program and did not participate in sports (N = 25). Participants were asked to draw images of an athlete, a girl, and themselves, then explain the images to interviewers. A drawing analysis (i.e., an iterative content analysis of participant drawings) revealed differences in implicit notions of what identity characteristics each group of participants attributed to athletes and girls. Analysis also revealed group differences in either similarity or divergence among the three drawings, indicating higher or lower levels of identification with athletes and gender among groups. Implications for the relationship between athletic and feminine identification and girls’ participation in youth sport are discussed. © The Author(s) 2019.","communication theory of identity; drawing analysis; gender disparities; identification; youth sport participation",,,,,,,,,"Antin, T.M., Constantine, N.A., Hunt, G., Conflicting discourses in qualitative research: The search for divergent data within cases (2015) Field Methods, 27, pp. 211-222; Ashcraft, K.L., Kuhn, T.R., Cooren, F., Constitutional amendments: “Materializing” organizational communication (2009) Academy of Management Annals, 3, pp. 1-64; Ayman-Nolley, S., Ayman, R., Children’s implicit theories of leadership (2005) The leadership horizon series: Implicit leadership theories—Essays and explorations, pp. 227-274. , Schyns B., Meindl J.R., (eds), Greenwich, CT, Information Age Publishing, (Eds.), (., –; Barak, K.S., Krane, V., Ross, S.R., Mann, M.E., Kaunert, C.A., Visual negotiation: How female athletes present intersectional identities in photographic self-representations (2018) Quest, 70, pp. 471-491; Beaver, T.D., Roller derby uniforms: The pleasures and dilemmas of sexualized attire (2014) International Review for the Sociology of Sport; Bell, E., Clarke, D.W., Beasts, burrowers and birds”: The enactment of researcher identities in UK business schools (2014) Management Learning, 45, pp. 249-266; Bem, S.L., Bem, D.J., Does sex-biased job advertising “aid and abet” sex discrimination?

However, these mega events are subject to considerable controversy due to their association with doping or corruption. This raises the question for the PSB of how to satisfy the audience of the Olympic Games: by looking closely or by looking away? Conducting two empirical studies, this article investigates how German public service broadcasters reported the sociopolitical problems related to the 2016 Olympic Summer Games and whether the coverage has met the expectations of the audience. The results of a content analysis suggest that a substantial amount of coverage was dedicated to the problematic aspects of the Games. A conjoint analysis shows that German public service broadcasters did not meet the expectations of different audience segments: Neither the core audience nor event-driven spectators and certainly not the outsiders of media sports were fully satisfied by the Olympic program menu of German PSB. © The Author(s) 2019.","2016 Rio Olympic Games; conjoint analysis; content analysis; public service broadcasting; sport mega events",,,,,,,,,"Addelman, S., Orthogonal main-effect plans for asymmetrical factorial experiments (1962) Technometrics, 4, pp. 21-46; (2016) Olympia-Presseheft von ARD und ZDF, , https://presseportal.zdf.de/fileadmin/zdf_upload/Bilder/Teaser-Bilder/2016/08/Olympische_Spiele_2016.pdf, [Olympic press report of ARD and ZDF].

Six primary narrative themes were identified: the impact on Piersall of pressure from his father to excel, his role as mentor to other players, celebration of his decision to come forward about his experience with mental illness, the “antics” for which he was so well known, his tendency to speak his mind while on the air, and his embrace of the notoriety that attached to sharing his experiences and to the colorful behavior he exhibited throughout his various careers. The narratives affirm a limited depiction of what the experience of mental illness is actually like. Piersall did not push back against that depiction, even as he paved the way for the more robust conversation about mental illness engaged in by professional athletes and encouraged by journalists. Piersall’s impact is diminished by the fact he was so willing to poke fun at himself, to use language that would, in today’s national dialogue about mental illness, be dismissed as inappropriate. Journalism has moved on to a more serious, more scripted treatment of an athlete coming forward to discuss the experience with mental illness. © The Author(s) 2019.","baseball; collective memory; journalism; mental illness; narrative analysis",,,,,,,,,"Armour, M., (2010) Jim Piersall, , http://www.sabr.org, Phoenix, AZ, Society for American Baseball Research, Retrieved from; Berdayes, L.C., Berdayes, V., The information superhighway in contemporary highway narrative (1998) Journal of Communication, 48, pp. 109-124; Berkowitz, D., Non-routine news and newswork: Exploring a what-a-story (1997) Social meanings of news, pp. 362-375. , Berkowitz D., (ed), Thousand Oaks, CA, Sage, (Ed.), (., –; Bishop, R., (2019) Quite a stir, , Unpublished manuscript; Bogdan, R., (1988) Freak show: Presenting human oddities for amusement and profit, , Chicago, IL, University of Chicago Press; Bruner, J., The narrative construction of reality (1991) Critical Inquiry, 18, pp. 1-21; Carey, J., (1989) Communication as culture, , Boston, MA, Unwin Hyman; Carolla, B., (2008) When stigma struck out: The Jimmy Piersall Story, , Arlington, VA, National Alliance on Mental Illness; Clare, E., Interview with T.

Socioemotional selectivity theory (SST) posits that older adults, with time limited, shift their focus on positive experiences. Entertainment media choices reflect this proactive emotion regulation strategy. This study applied that perspective to mediated sports content, itself characterized by emotional intensity and unknown outcomes. Using an online survey containing an experimental condition (N = 433), the current study investigated whether the unpredictability and emotional intensity of sports contribute to older people disengaging from viewing it. The results are mixed: Older adults consume less sports media than younger adults and value the outcome less but are equally likely to be sports fans or watch highly exciting sports contests. It seems that fanship may contribute to happiness for some and thus reflect an active choice. Future research should investigate individual differences among older sports fans and nonfans to expand knowledge on their (emotional) viewing experiences. © The Author(s) 2019.","age; emotion regulation; entertainment media; sports fanship; sports media",,,,,,,,,"Bartsch, A., As time goes by: What changes and what remains the same in entertainment experience over the life span?

Applying social cognitive theory, we surveyed 423 Chinese respondents about their gender perceptions of 16 sports. Results revealed four distinct categories—masculine, lifestyle, neutral, and feminine—and that men tended to rate sports as significantly more masculine than women. Overall, gender role beliefs, sports participation, and sports media consumption all significantly correlated with individual gender typing of sports. The findings of this study, which is based on findings from Hardin and Greer and is one of the first quantitative studies about gender perceptions of sports in China, shed light on the role that gender norms play in shaping the country’s sports landscape.

Fourteen student-athletes (six male and eight female) from nonrevenue-generating sports at two universities (a Division I and a Division II) participated in semistructured interviews. Three major focuses structured this study: (a) meaning attributed to teammate exit, (b) alteration of student-athletes’ tasks and roles, and (c) changes to student-athletes’ relationships with teammates and coaches. The results showed consistent themes amongst participants in terms of meanings attached to types of exits (e.g., exhausted eligibility and removal from team) and alterations to tasks, roles, and relationships. Overall, the study provides a theoretical shift from previous transitional literature by focusing on the remaining team members rather than the exiting athlete, as well as validating the organizational structures and processes by which collegiate teams function, which adds information about organizing and enacting communicative processes of sport. Lastly, practical implications are provided for coaches and sport management to maintain team relations and optimize team performance following athlete exit. © The Author(s) 2019.","athlete socialization;

The launch of The Athletic, a subscription-only digital site for sport coverage and opinion, has been watched with great interest within the sports journalism world, as it represents a new method of financing journalistic endeavors. The majority of hires at The Athletic over its first few years have been marketable writers from traditional newspaper backgrounds. This study utilizes a qualitative methodology to examine introductory stories written by new hires to The Athletic (N = 88). Through open coding, the study evaluated these stories for common themes relating to the authors’ newfound employment and transition to a supposedly new model of journalism. The study found three overarching themes, centered on the writers’ explanations of their own biographical backgrounds, attempts to convince the audience of the superiority of the new editorial model being employed by The Athletic, and communicating to the audience what they should expect and deserve. Framing theory is utilized as a guiding theoretical perspective as themes from the stories and their underlying implications are discussed. © The Author(s) 2019.","digital; framing; journalism; open coding;

As women are often marginalised in offline and online sports discourse, Tumblr’s football fandom was chosen to investigate how women experience their fandom on a platform with a mostly female and young user population. The results of 14 in-depth qualitative interviews with heavily invested female Tumblr users show that the fandom’s communication culture allows fans to interact in a variety of creative ways that involve the use of a specialist vocabulary. This Tumblr fandom is overwhelmingly female, which makes the interviewees feel that they can talk freely about football. Thus, Tumblr has the potential to serve as a safe space for female fans. Yet, its highly opinionated discussions and rivalries mirror those in the traditional football fandom. This study contributes to the literature that explores how women express their sports fandom online and demonstrates how they have found a niche in which to discuss their favourite sport on their own terms. © The Author(s) 2019.","football; gender; marginalisation; sports fan; Tumblr",,,,,,,,,"Aden, R.C., Rahoi, R.L., Beck, C.S., Dreams are born on places like this”: The process of interpretive community formation at the field of dreams site (1995) Communication Quarterly, 43, pp. 368-380; Anderson, B., (1991) Imagined communities: Reflections on origins and spread of nationalism, , London, England, Verso; Andrews, D.L., Clift, B.C., Football and stardom: On context, intertextuality and reflexivity (2017) Routledge handbook of football studies, pp. 200-211. , Hughson J., Moore K., Spaaij R., Maguire J., (eds), New York, NY, Routledge, (Eds.), (., –; Antunovic, D., Hardin, M., Women and the blogosphere: Exploring feminist approaches to sport (2015) International Review for the Sociology of Sport, 50, pp. 661-677; Azizi, N., Tambunan, S.M.G., Constructing an imagined community of fandom and articulating gender identity: A case study on Indonesian female football fans’ participation in social media (2018) Cultural dynamics in a globalized world, pp. 311-316. , Budianta M., Budiman M., Kusno A., Moriyama M., (eds), London, England, Routledge, (Eds.), (., –; Bandy, S.J., Gori, G., Jinxia, D., From women and sport to gender and sport: Transnational, transdisciplinary, and intersectional perspectives (2012) The International Journal of the History of Sport, 29, pp. 667-674; Baym, N.K., The new shape of online community: The example of Swedish independent music fandom (2007) First Monday, 12; Benkwitz, A., Molnar, G., Interpreting and exploring football fan rivalries: An overview (2012) Soccer & Society, 13, pp. 479-494; Berendt, J., Uhrich, S., Enemies with benefits: The dual role of rivalry in shaping sports fans’ identity (2016) European Sport Management Quarterly, 16, pp. 613-634; Billings, A.C., Qiao, F., Conlin, L., Nie, T., Permanently desiring the temporary?

It is not uncommon for former athletes to turn to sports media for a new start, and as they do so, they enter a profession that is engaged in its own process of redefining itself as new genres of sports media continue to emerge, a process that has forced legacy outlets to find innovative ways to compete and reimagine what constitutes effective sports journalism. Taking these simultaneous ongoing struggles into consideration, this research uses a qualitative approach grounded in the sociocultural tradition to first explore how former athletes working in sports media negotiate their sense of self and, secondly, make meaning around the value of athletic experience in the profession. Using one-on-one, in-depth interviews with 13 former athletes working in sports media, this research assesses how former athletic experience is situated and understood among sports media professionals, with a particular focus on what being a former athlete means to the notion of professional competency. The analysis produced three themes, which focus on notions of identity, professionalism, and the gendered implications underpinning these shared meanings. © The Author(s) 2019.","broadcasting; gender; identity; sport journalism; sport management; sport media",,,,,,,,,"Ahmed, A., (2008) Ontological, epistemological, and methodological assumptions: Qualitative versus quantitative, , http://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED504903.pdf, Retrieved from; Autonovic, D., Whiteside, E., Feminist sports media studies: State of the field (2018) Feminist approaches to media theory and research, pp. 111-130. , Harp D., Loke J., Bachmann I., (eds), Cham, Switzerland, Palgrave Macmillan, (Eds.), (., –; Bardick, A., Bernes, K., Chorney, D., Gunn, T., McKnight, K., Orr, D., Life after sport: Athletic career transition and transferrable skills (2009) Journal of Excellence, 13, pp. 63-77; Berkowitz, D.A., Reporters and their sources (2009) Handbook of journalism studies, pp. 102-115. , Wahl-Jorgensen K., Hanitzch T., (eds), New York, NY, Routledge, (Eds.), (., –; Brewer, B., Van Raatle, J., Linder, D., Athletic identity: Hercules muscle or Achilles’ heel?

In analyzing these responses, we argue that the Golden Knights’ memorialization efforts, while operating within a familiar public relations script of the sporting commercialization of memorial, productively turned T-Mobile Arena into a space, however sanitized, for the enactment of rituals and a discourse of renewal. This space was otherwise absent from the rest of the tourist-oriented confines of the Strip. Further, the rhetorical conjoining of the hashtags #VegasStrong, which emerged shortly after the shooting, and #VegasBorn, which was originally used to market the team, operated as simultaneous symbols for both the team and its community. This allowed the sporting franchise to move between commercial and civic uses, operating as both branding for the team and as an embodied act of remembrance for local residents. © The Author(s) 2019.","hashtag; Las Vegas; memorialization; social media; sport",,,,,,,,,"Sin City gets serious in powerful tribute from the Las Vegas convention and visitors authority (2017) Ad Age, , www.adaage.com, October, 5, Retrieved from; Akers, M., Mass shooting memorial crosses moved from Strip to museum after ceremony (2017) Las Vegas Sun, , www.lasvegassun.com, November, 12, Retrieved from; Bale, J., Sport and national identity: A geographical view (1986) The International Journal of the History of Sport, 3, pp. 18-41; Bale, J., The changing face of football: Stadiums and community (2000) Soccer & Society, 1, pp. 91-101; Bazer, G., Culberston, S., When FDR said, “play ball (2002) Prologue Magazine, 34. , https://www.archives.gov/publications/prologue/2002/spring/greenlight.html, Retrieved from; Bonilla, Y., Rosa, J., #Ferguson: Digital protest, hashtag ethnography, and the racial politics of social media in the United States (2015) American Ethnologist, 42, pp. 4-17; Borer, M.I., Re-sensing Las Vegas: Aesthetic entrepreneurship and local urban culture (2017) Journal of Urbanism: International Research on Placemaking and Urban Sustainability, 10, pp. 111-124; Brown, R.S., Sport and healing America (2004) Society, 42, pp. 37-41; Bruns, A., Burgess, J., (2011) The use of Twitter hashtags in the formation of ad hoc publics, , http://eprints.qut.edu.au/46515/, Paper presented at the 6th European Consortium for Political Research General Conference, Reykjavík, Iceland, Retrieved from; Butterworth, M.L., Ritual in the “church of baseball”: Suppressing the discourse of democracy after 9/11 (2005) Communication and Critical/Cultural Studies, 2, pp. 107-129; Butterworth, M.L., Militarism and memorializing at the pro football hall of fame (2012) Communication and Critical/Cultural Studies, 9, pp. 241-258; Butterworth, M.L., Public memorializing in the stadium (2014) Communication & Sport, 2, pp. 203-224; Burroughs, B., Rugg, A., Extending the broadcast: Streaming culture and the problems of digital geographies (2014) Journal of Broadcasting & Electronic Media, 58, pp. 365-380; Cano, R.C., Las Vegas’ “What happens here” slogan returns after shooting (2018) Las Vegas Review Journal, , www.reviewjournal.com, January, 5, Retrieved from, (, a; Cano, R.C., Vegas garden gives families, shooting victims place to mourn (2018) Washington Post, , www.washingtonpost.com, September, 29, Retrieved from, (, b; Douglass, W.A., Raento, P., The tradition of invention: Conceiving Las Vegas (2004) Annals of Tourism Research, 31, pp. 7-23; Dubois, L., Boston Strong” emerges as rallying cry, from stadiums to tweets (2013) NBC News, , www.nbcnews.com, Retrieved from; Fischer, M., Commemorating 9/11 NFL-style: Insights into America’s culture of militarism (2013) Journal of Sport & Social Issues, 38, pp. 199-221; Fortini, A., What happened in Vegas (2018) The California Sunday Magazine, , https://story.californiasunday.com/las-vegas-shooting, May, 22, Retrieved from; Frosh, P., Pinchevski, A., Media witnessing and the ripeness of time (2014) Cultural Studies, 28, pp. 594-610; Gano, D.A., Zagacki, K.S., Cleansing the superdome: The paradox of purity and post-Katrina guilt (2011) Quarterly Journal of Speech, 97, pp. 201-223; Gavin, M., (2012) Sports in the aftermath of tragedy: From Kennedy to Katrina, , Lanham, MD, Scarecrow Press; Gola, H., Hours after JFK was assassinated, NFL commish Pete Rozelle made the decision he would live to regret (2013) New York Daily News, , https://www.nydailynews.com, November, 23, Retrieved from; Gotz, B., Knights continue to lift spirits during Oct. 1 remembrances (2018) Las Vegas Review-Journal, , https://www.reviewjournal.com, October, 1, Retrieved from; Jaklewicz, G., What happened in Vegas touched us all (2018) Abilene Reporter News, , https://www.reporternews.com/, October, 3, Retrieved from; Judd, D.R., Fainstein, S.S., (1999) The Tourist City, , New Haven, CT, Yale University Press, (Eds; Johnson, R., Chambers, D., Raghuram, P., Tincknell, E., (2004) The practice of cultural studies, , Thousand Oaks, CA, Sage; (2017) Vegas strong marquees mid-strip, , www.press.lvca.com, October, 3, Retrieved from; Lin, Y.R., Margolin, D., The ripple of fear, sympathy and solidarity during the Boston bombings (2014) EPJ Data Science, 3, p. 31; Lupiani, J., MGM Resorts slammed for new ad after mass shooting (2017) KTNV, , www.ktnv.com, October, 19, Retrieved from; Pierce, C.P., Black Sunday: The NFL plays on after JFK's assassination (2014) Sports Illustrated, , https://www.si.com, November, 19, Retrieved from; Pierce, C.P., Win city: The playoff-bound golden knights have helped humanize—and Heal—Las Vegas (2018) Sports Illustrated, , https://www.si.com, April, 4, Retrieved from; Ramshaw, G., Gammon, S., On home ground?

As audiences grow, media coverage extends to ever more varied domains, which are themselves then colonised by an increasing range of discourses. One of main discourses to develop since the early 2000s has been that of the so-called supercrip, one which challenges the notion of “impairment” often connected with disability by foregrounding the para-athletes’ triumph over adversity, celebrating instead their courage, grit, and perseverance leading to athletic success and personal and increasingly national prestige. In this article, we analyse the continuing importance of the supercrip discourse in coverage of the Rio Paralympics but also move on to highlight its tactical alignment with other—both competing and complementary—discourses of nationalism, sexualisation, militarisation, and celebritisation. We analyse textual and visual manifestations of these discourses using both critical discourse analysis and Foucauldian discourse analysis. We conclude by paying particular attention to the increasing visibility of discourses which, while acknowledging the potentially positive role of the supercrip discourse in focussing on athletic success, repurpose that discourse by foregrounding instead the day-to-day experiences of belittling misrepresentation and neglect, including political neglect. © The Author(s) 2019.","media representations; militarisation; parasport; politicisation; sexualisation; supercrip",,,,,,,,,"Batts, C., Andrews, D.L., Tactical athletes: The United States Paralympic military program and the mobilization of the disabled soldier/athlete (2011) Sport in Society, 14, pp. 553-568; Berger, R.J., Disability and the dedicated wheelchair athlete: Beyond the “supercrip” critique (2008) Journal of Contemporary Ethnography, 37, pp. 647-678; Blain, N., O’Donnell, H., European sports journalism and its readers: Living without the Sun (1998) Sport, popular culture and identity, pp. 37-56. , Roche M., (ed), Aachen, Germany, Meyer & Meyer, (Ed.), (., –; Blain, N., O’Donnell, H., (2003) Media, monarchy and power, , Bristol, England, Intellect; Bush, A., Silk, M., Porter, J., Howe, P.D., Disability [sport] and discourse: Stories within the Paralympic legacy (2013) Reflective Practice, 14, pp. 632-647; Butler, S., Bissell, K., Olympic effort: Disability, culture, and resistance in the 2012 London Olympic Games (2015) Journalism & Communication Monographs, pp. 1-46; Coles, B., Disabled sport in crisis as numbers of participants drop by ten per cent since London 2012 (2018) The Telegraph, , https://www.telegraph.co.uk/paralympic-sport/2018/08/15/disabled-sport-crisis-numbers-participants-drop-ten-per-cent/, August, 15, Retrieved August 20, 2018, from; Cooky, C., Messner, M., Women play sport, but not on YV: a longitudinal study of televised news media (2013) Communication & Sport, 1, pp. 203-230; Dayan, D., Katz, E., (1992) Media events: The live broadcasting of history, , Cambridge, MA, Harvard University Press; Ellis, K., Beyond the aww factor: Human interest profiles of Paralympians and the media navigation of physical difference and social stigma (2009) Asia Pacific Media Educator, 19, pp. 23-36; Ellis, K., Goggin, G., (2015) Disability and the media, , Basingstoke, England, Palgrave MacMillan; Fairclough, N., (2015) Language and power, , 3rd ed, London, England, Routledge; Foucault, M., (2002) The archaeology of knowledge, , Sheridan Smith A.M., (ed), London, England, Routledge, (, Trans; Goggin, G., Newell, C., Crippling Paralympics?

These documentaries share narrative elements of reality makeover television’s hybrid entertainment/educational format, deploying popular tropes of reinvention and personal empowerment through guided consumption. In focusing largely on participants dealing with chronic health issues, the documentaries reproduce dominant neoliberal ideologies about personal responsibility for health through fitness and construct CrossFit as a socially engaged brand with an inclusive fitness mission. These documentaries may also mitigate dominant, intimidating media images of high-performing CrossFit competitors who embody the brand image, as well as CrossFit’s reputation as an extreme fitness practice. This article takes Dawson’s (2017) position that CrossFit is a contemporary reinventive institution, which makes omnivorous demands of its adherents’ lives in exchange for personal transformation. In these documentaries, participants’ successful transition into exemplary CrossFit membership hinges not only on capitulation to these demands but recognition of them as desirable steps toward self-making and health. Reinvention is depicted as willing conformity to CrossFit values and behaviours, rather than simply the achievement of physical fitness, and those who successfully transform are constructed as aspirational embodiments of the brand. © The Author(s) 2019.","CrossFit; fitness; reinvention; social media; YouTube",,,,,,,,,"(2016) [video], , https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6FgsUPA0xc, Retrieved from; Beers, E., Virtuousity goes viral (2014) The CrossFit Journal, pp. 1-10. , http://library.crossfit.com/free/pdf/CFJ_2014_06_10000_Beers3.pdf, Retrieved from; Belluz, J., CrossFit is amassing an army of doctors trying to disrupt health care (2018) Vox, , https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2018/12/13/18095546/crossfit-greg-glassman-doctors-health-care-prevention, December, 13, Retrieved from; Bolat, N., The functions of the narrator in digital advertising (2017) Narrative advertising models and conceptualization in the digital age, pp. 184-201. , Yilmax R., (ed), PA, IGI Global, (Ed.), (., –,).

The investment toward, participation in, and consumption of the sport has surged in the years following the Chinese Communist Party’s implementation of major 2015 reforms intended to (1) develop the domestic professional football league, (2) grow the sport’s popularity among the country’s 1.4 billion population, (3) increase youth participation, (4) develop the national team to be the best team in Asia, and (5) aggressively bid for a men’s FIFA World Cup. Despite these significant levels of State and private investment theretoward, there are still significant concerns within the Chinese and international media publics about the footballing nation—specifically as related to the performance of the Chinese men’s national team. In this article, we present a comparative analysis of Chinese- and English-language news media representations that frame how east and west media publics might “read” various aspects of Chinese football (commercial, cultural, ideological, etc.). In so doing, we identify and analyze major themes which, as popularized in different popular media contexts, articulate the men’s national team’s performance to broader (inter)national anxieties about the state of football and the geopolitical trajectories of the People’s Republic. © The Author(s) 2019.","authoritarian determinism;

Specifically, the researchers were concerned with the image-repair approach utilized by MSU during Nassar’s hearing and in its immediate aftermath. Additionally, the researchers examined users’ responses via Facebook comments to determine reactions to MSU’s image-repair strategies. MSU primarily employed the image-repair tactic of corrective action along with rallying, bolstering, and mortification. Overall, individuals posting comments did not appear to buy into MSU’s image repair. Users focused blame on MSU for mishandling the situation and discussed various aspects of the Nassar case as well as MSU’s mistreatment of the victims. Additionally, there was a call for MSU to change its culture, take ownership of its mistakes, and become a leader in dealing with sexual assault on campus. © The Author(s) 2019.","Facebook; image repair;

Informed by social cognitive and framing theories, the present study examined how news stories characterized the disclosures, examining ways in which journalists presented the athletes as mental health advocates and models for pro-health attitudes and behavior. News stories generally framed the athletes as demonstrating character strength for disclosing mental illness in an athletic culture that often stigmatizes any potential weakness. Journalists often permitted the athletes to directly share their message concerning mental health with readers, as DeRozan and Love discussed (a) the experience of coming out; (b) the positive reception of teammates, coaches, and the public; and (c) the need for an end to mental health–oriented stigma. Stories often called for action, communicating to readers that people with mental illness are “not alone” and should share their experiences with others. The results provide the foundation for research into the relationship between media exposure and mental health–related attitudes, particularly how news framing of athletes’ disclosures shape fan attitudes toward mental health treatment, mental illness, and people who experience mental illness. © The Author(s) 2019.","anxiety; athlete; depression; mental; news",,,,,,,,,"Angermeyer, M.C., Dietrich, S., Pott, D., Matschinger, H., Media consumption and desire for social distance towards people with schizophrenia (2005) European Psychiatry, 20, pp. 246-250; Bandura, A., Social cognitive theory of mass communication (2001) Media Psychology, 3, pp. 265-299; Basil, M.D., Identification as a mediator of celebrity effects (1996) Journal of Broadcasting & Electronic Media, 40, pp. 478-495; Billings, A.C., Moscowitz, L.M., (2018) The coming out of gay male athletes in American team sports, , New York, NY, Peter Lang; Boren, C., NFL’s Steve Smith Sr. tells how depression robbed him of enjoying his career (2018) Chicago Tribune, , https://www.chicagotribune.com/sports/football/ct-spt-steve-smith-depression-20180807-story.html, August, 7, Retrieved from; Brady, R., How a DeMar DeRozan tweet sparked a mental-health dialogue in sports (2018) The Globe & Mail, , https://www.theglobeandmail.com/sports/basketball/article-how-a-derozan-tweet-sparked-a-mental-health-dialogue/, Retrieved from; Brown, K.A., Licen, S., Billings, A.C., Devlin, M.B., Envisioning Slovenia, telecast from Brazil: Relationships between national identity and Slovenian viewership of the 2016 Rio Summer Olympic Games (2017) International Journal of Sport Communication, 10, pp. 487-507; Brown, W.J., Basil, M.D., Media celebrities and public health: Responses to “Magic” Johnson’s HIV disclosure and its impact on AIDS risk and high-risk behaviors (1995) Health Communication, 7, pp. 345-370; Brown, W.J., Basil, M.D., Bocarnea, M.C., The influence of famous athletes on health beliefs and practices: Mark McGwire, child abuse prevention, and androstenedione (2003) Journal of Health Communication, 8, pp. 41-57; Brown, W.J., Chaván de Matviuk, M.A., Sports celebrities and public health: Diego Maradona’s influence on drug use prevention (2010) Journal of Health Communication, 15, pp. 358-373; Burstyn, V., (1999) The rites of men: Manhood, politics, and the culture of sport, , Toronto, CA, University Press; Caputo, N.M., Rouner, D., Narrative processing of entertainment media and mental illness stigma (2011) Health Communication, 26 (7), pp. 595-604; Clement, S., Schauman, O., Graham, T., Maggioni, F., Evans-Lacko, S., Bezborodovs, N., Thornicroft, G., What is the impact of mental health-related stigma on help-seeking?

To do so, the investigation employed data of IRA bots released from Clemson University. We conducted analysis by approaching bots’ gatekeeping activities from three perspectives: the overall behavioral patterns, the discourses and underpinning ideologies, and communicative tactics to sustain attention on Twitter. The results revealed that the majority of tweets came from the right trolls and left trolls. Meanwhile, the activity level of the bots displayed high sensitivity to emergent political events. Importantly, the two types of bots orchestrated a gatekeeping agenda that propelled antagonistic, hyperpartisan politics.

The consequences of these injuries can affect athletes’ scholastic and athletic performance in the short term, and manifest later in life, long after their athletic career ends. Present educational efforts are ineffective because they neglect important influences on athletes’ decisions to report potential concussion injuries. Here, we present research that examines organization-based influences on vestedness in attitudes related to athletes’ perceived risk of concussion consequences and team commitment. Examining a sample of 435 collegiate athletes from 11 universities, participating in six Division I/Power-5 conference high-concussion-risk sports, our findings support that organizational-based perceptions exert influence on these key concussion–related variables. In synthesizing the results, we offer evidence-based recommendations that organizational members can use to create environments that promote concussion injury reporting and adherence to recovery protocols. This research contributes to the growing body of literature calling for the development of educational concussion injury education modules that recognize contextual influences grounded in communication theory and provide a persuasive impetus. © The Author(s) 2019.","collegiate sports; communication; concussion reporting; organizational influence; risk perception",,,,,,,,,"Adame, B.J., Corman, S.R., Vested interests and perceived risk of concussion consequences among power-5 college athletes (2018) Health Communication, pp. 1-10; Adame, B.J., Miller, C.H., Vested interest, disaster preparedness, and strategic campaign message design (2015) Health Communication, 30, pp. 271-281; Adame, B.J., Miller, C.H., Vested interest: Developing scales for assessing flooding preparedness (2016) Disaster Prevention and Management, 25, pp. 282-297; Adame, B.J., Miller, C.H., Risk perception and earthquake preparedness motivation: Predicting responses to a Cascadia Subduction Zone catastrophic event (2018) Natural disasters and risk communication: Implications of the Cascadia Subduction Zone megaquake, pp. 49-86. , Fletcher C.V., Lovejoy J., (eds), Lanham MD, Lexington Books, (Eds.), (., –; Asken, B.M., McCrea, M.A., Clugston, J.R., Snyder, A.R., Houck, Z.M., Bauer, R.M., Playing through it”: Delayed reporting and removal from athletic activity after concussion predicts prolonged recovery (2016) Journal of Athletic Training, 51, pp. 329-335; Bagley, A.F., Daneshvar, D.H., Schanker, B.D., Zurakowski, D., d’Hemecourt, C.A., Nowinski, C.J., Effectiveness of the SLICE program for youth concussion education (2012) Clinical Journal of Sports Medicine, 22, pp. 385-389. , …; Bandura, A., Self-efficacy mechanism in human agency (1982) American Psychologist, 37, pp. 122-147; Beckwith, J.G., Greenwald, R.M., Chu, J.J., Crisco, J.J., Rowson, S., Duma, S.M., Timing of concussion diagnosis is related to head impact exposure prior to injury (2013) Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise, 45, pp. 747-754. , …; Bisel, R.S., A communicative ontology of organization?

By using a sample of over 4.5 million tweets, we applied a social networks approach to examine whether and, if so, how different types of users influence online engagement and patterns of information flow of professional football clubs on Twitter. We focus on five types of social mediators (i.e., key users who connect organizations with their publics): (1) organizational (e.g., teams or players), (2) industry (e.g., competitors or associations), (3) media (e.g., journalists), (4) individual (e.g., fans), and (5) celebrities. Our results indicate that the power of media social mediators—the most traditional mediators—has declined over recent years, and they were negatively associated with engagement on Twitter. Instead, relationships between football clubs and publics were primarily mediated by individual social mediators, for top division clubs in particular.

In doing so, we identified preliminary dimensions of esports online spectator demand based on semistructured interviews and online open-ended surveys. Findings resulted from the qualitative study were adopted as the foundation to develop the Scale for Esports Spectator Demand (SESD). To validate the SESD and assess the impact of the SESD factors on consumers’ cognitive and behavioral outcomes, a sample of esports online spectators (N = 1,309) responded to a survey containing the SESD, which was randomly split into two halves, with one half for an exploratory factor analysis and the other half for a confirmatory factor analysis and structural equation modeling analyses. A total of 32 items under eight SESD factors were confirmed. While demand factors including commentary features, player characteristics, event attractiveness, and schedule convenience have been found in traditional sport contexts, chat room, streamer traits, stream quality, and virtual rewards appeared to be unique in esports. All eight SESD factors, excluding schedule convenience, were significantly predictive of one or more of the outcomes associated with esports consumption. © The Author(s) 2019.","consumer behavior; esports;

While White athletes accounted for 283 features and Black athletes 329, the former were featured in 35 of 43 sports observed, compared to just 14 for the latter. In fact, more than 80% of all features on Black athletes focused on basketball, football, and boxing. Latino athletes accounted for 52 of the 681 total features and represented 15 sports, one more than African Americans. Recognizing existing research, the study applies the term mediated sport stacking to the practice of limiting the Black athletic experience primarily to team sports, especially basketball. The article considers the implications of statistical patterns observed and also includes limitations and recommendations for future research. © The Author(s) 2019.","athletes; magazines; race; sport communication",,,,,,,,,"Abrahamson, D., Magazine exceptionalism: The concept, the criteria, the challenge (2007) Journalism Studies, 8, pp. 667-670; Andrews, D.L., Jackson, S.J., (2001) Sport stars: The cultural politics of sporting celebrity, , London, England, Routledge, (Eds; Atencio, M., Wright, J., We be killin’ them”: Hierarchies of Black masculinity in urban basketball spaces (2008) Sociology of Sport Journal, 25, pp. 263-280; Baker, J., Yardley, J., Cote, J., Coach behaviors and athlete satisfaction in team and individual sports (2003) International Journal of Sport Psychology, 34, pp. 226-239; Beamon, K.K., Are sports overemphasized in the socialization process of African American males?

This omission is particularly significant considering the rapid commodification of the Paralympic spectacle, exacerbated by the entry of Channel 4 (C4) as the UK Paralympic rights holders, that has seen the games become an important site of disability (re-)presentation. In this article, we focus on the construction of national, normative, disabled bodies in Paralympic representation drawn from an analysis of three integrated data sets from C4’s broadcasting of the Rio 2016 Paralympics: interviews with C4 production and editorial staff, quantitative content analysis, and qualitative moving image analysis. We highlight the strategic approach taken by C4 to focus on successful medal-winning athletes, the implications this has on the sports and disability classifications given media coverage, and the role of affective high-value production practices. We also reveal the commercial tensions and editorial decisions that broadcasters face with respect to which disabilities/bodies are made hypervisible—and thereby those which are marginalized—as national disability sport icons that inculcate preferred notions of disability and the (re-)imagined nation. © The Author(s) 2019.","broadcasting; disability; mixed methods; nationalism; Paralympics; representation; Rio 2016",,,,,,,,,"Anderson, B., (1991) Imagined communities, , London, England, Verso; Anderson, B., Neoliberal affects (2016) Progress in Human Geography, 40, pp. 734-753; Andrews, D., Jackson, S., (2001) Sports stars: The cultural politics of sporting celebrity, , London, England, Routledge; Bairner, A., (2001) Sport, nationalism, and globalisation: European and North American perspectives, , Albany, State University of New York Press; Bairner, A., Molnar, G., (2009) The politics of the Olympics: A survey, , London, England, Routledge; Barnes, C., Mercer, G., (2010) Exploring disability, , Cambridge, England, Polity Press; Batts, C., Andrews, D.L., ‘Tactical athletes’: The United States Paralympic Military Programme and the mobilization of the disabled soldier/athlete (2011) Sport in Society, 14, pp. 553-568; Berger, R.J., Disability and the dedicated wheelchair athlete: Beyond the supercrip critique (2008) Journal of Contemporary Ethnography, 37, pp. 647-678; Black, J., ‘As British as fish and chips’: British newspaper representations of Mo Farah during the 2012 London Olympic Games (2016) Media, Culture & Society, 38, pp. 979-996; Bruce, T., Us and them: The influence of discourses of nationalism on media coverage of the Paralympics (2014) Disability & Society, 29, pp. 1443-1459; Chalaby, J.K., Television and globalization: The TV content global value chain (2016) Journal of Communication, 66, pp. 35-59; Chang, I., Crossman, J., ‘When there is a will, there is a way’: A quantitative comparison of the newspaper coverage of the 2004 summer Paralympic and Olympic Games (2009) International Journal of Applied Sports Sciences, 21, pp. 16-34; (2016) Annual Report, 2016, , https://annualreport.channel4.com/downloads/Paralympic.pdf, Retrieved from; Coffey, A., Atkinson, P., (1996) Making sense of qualitative data, , London, England, Sage; Crow, L., Scroungers and superhumans: Images of disability from the summer of 2012: A visual inquiry (2014) Journal of Visual Culture, 13, pp. 168-181; De Cillia, R.F., Reisigl, M., Wodak, R., The Discursive construction of national identities (1999) Discourse & Society, 10, pp. 149-173; Delaney, K.J., Methodological dilemmas and opportunities in interviewing organizational elites (2007) Sociology Compass, 1, pp. 208-221; Gellner, E., (1983) Nations and nationalisms, , Ithaca, NY, Cornell University Press; Giroux, H., Private satisfactions and public disorders: “Fight club,” patriarchy, and the politics of masculine violence (2001) A Journal of Composition Theory, 21, pp. 1-31; Grossberg, L., (1992) We gotta get out of this place: Popular conservatism and postmodern culture, , London, England, Routledge; Hall, S., Notes on deconstructing the popular (1981) People’s history and socialist theory, pp. 21-33. , Samuel R., (ed), London, England, Routledge, (Ed.), (., –; Hardin, C., Finding the ‘neo’ in neoliberalism (2014) Cultural Studies, 28, pp. 199-221; Held, D., McGrew, A., Goldblatt, D., Perraton, J., (1999) Global transformations: Politics, economics and culture, , Stanford, CA, Stanford University Press; Hobsbawm, E., Introduction: Inventing traditions (1983) The invention of tradition, , Hobsbawm E., Ranger T., (eds), Cambridge, England, Cambridge University Press, (Eds; Howe, P.D., Silva, C.F., The cyborgification of Paralympic sport (2017) Movement & Sport Sciences, 97, pp. 17-25; (2016) IPC and Channel 4 set to agree new partnership for PyeongChang 2018, Tokyo 2020, , https://www.paralympic.org/news/ipc-and-channel-4-set-agree-new-partnership-pyeongchang-2018-tokyo-2020, Retrieved from; Jackson-Brown, C., (2018) PhD thesis).

Several conservative political commentators have accused ESPN of a liberal bias in their recent coverage of social issues within and related to sport. This study examined the political perception of ESPN by audiences, by applying a perceptual theory of communication known as the hostile media effect. Prior research of the hostile media effect has found that audiences with strongly held beliefs subjectively perceive media bias relative to their own beliefs, whether or not any actual bias is being demonstrated by the media source in question. Through a nationwide survey, study subjects were asked about their political leanings, media consumption, and views on ESPN. Statistical analysis found that individuals with conservative political leanings were more likely than others to view ESPN as hostile to their political beliefs, and those who perceived ESPN as hostile media were less likely to trust ESPN to cover social and political issues fairly. © The Author(s) 2017.","bias; ESPN; hostile media effect; politics; television",,,,,,,,,"Blyn, B., ESPN research on bias and viewership (2017) ESPN Front Row, , http://www.espnfrontrow.com/2017/06/espn-research-bias-viewership/, 6, 5, Retrieved from; Brady, J., Inside and out, ESPN dealing with changing political dynamics (2016) ESPN, , http://www.espn.com/blog/ombudsman/post/_/id/767/inside-and-out-espn-dealing-with-changing-political-dynamics, 12, 1, Retrieved from; Buhrmester, M., Kwang, T., Gosling, S.D., Amazon’s Mechanical Turk: A new source of inexpensive, yet high-quality, data?

Specifically, we explore CrossFit, a particularly prominent fitness program, in light of the ways that neoliberal discourses and the exigencies of being self-made pointedly inform contemporary understandings of gender and the body. Drawing on data from an ethnographically inspired study, we suggest that CrossFit constructs its ideal participant through the three discursive mechanisms of (1) reclamation, (2) self-making, and (3) exceptionalism. Ultimately, we argue that the ideal Xtreme fitness participant, made possible in part by personal branding, reproduces neoliberal self-made discourse by physically wearing one’s moral choices.

Researchers conducted a quantitative content analysis of randomly selected front pages of sports sections from large-, medium-, and small-city newspapers for 10-year intervals in the period 1932–2012 (40 years before and after Title IX’s 1972 passage). Numbers of articles and photos and the square area devoted to them in each year were calculated. The researchers found traditional patterns of story placement and inequality persisted in large-city newspapers over the 80-year span, but small-city and medium-city newspaper coverage changed in favor of women’s sports. Thus, this article explores the thesis that proximity to women’s sports correlates to greater equality of coverage and the advancement of women’s sports. This article provides a springboard for future investigation into a larger question of the role local media play in advancing social change and social movements and suggests local media might be more effective, even if unintentionally, than big media. © The Author(s) 2017.","agenda-setting;

This article examines the discursive ripples that result when this connection between sports, nationalism and respectability, and “moderate Muslims” is disrupted. I take up the case study of the 2013 Boston Marathon Bombing mastermind, Tamerlan Tsarnaev, who was also an accomplished boxer. First, I describe how discourse about sports emerges in conversations about “moderate Muslims,” and second, I examine how Tsarnaev’s athletic accomplishments mediate his terrorist persona in the news coverage. I draw on respectability politics and Jasbir Puar’s concept of the hypertrophied heterosexual in my analysis. In doing so, I establish how discourse about sports mediates conversations about U.S. Muslim identity and furthers U.S. exceptionalism. © The Author(s) 2017.","anti-Muslim sentiment; exceptionalism; masculinity; respectability; sports",,,,,,,,,"Abramson, M., Super middleweight Edwin Rodriguez wishes he’d finished Tamerlan Tsarnaev in ring (2013) New York Daily News, , http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/more-sports/tamerlan-tsarnaev-amateur-boxing-champ-article-1.1321846, 4, 20, Retrieved from; Adely, H., Clifton Muslim family perplexed at Trump’s portrayals (2016) The Record, , http://www.northjersey.com/story/news/2016/06/19/clifton-muslim-family-perplexed-at-trumps-portrayals/94826704/, 6, 19, Retrieved from; Amara, M., Sport, Islam, and Muslims in Europe: In between or on the margin?

To analyze the influence of athletes in the production of mediasport narratives, the focus on mediasport interpellation theory is applied to athletes as both readers and producers of consumerist mediasport hails and is then explored in two case studies. During the 2012 Olympics, a band of athletes launched the #WeDemandChange campaign against Rule 40 of the Olympic Charter, which limits social media speech rights. This impedes financial opportunities because they are unable to blog and tweet about their sponsors if they are not also Olympic sponsors. In 2016, non-Olympic sponsors furthered anti-Rule 40 protests, positioning themselves as covictims. The 2012 and 2016 campaigns framed Rule 40 as a civil rights and speech advocacy issue; however, they primarily focused on building better market conditions for non-Olympic sponsors. In so doing, they obfuscated systemic conditions that contribute to the untenable financial situations described in the protests themselves. Ultimately, it is argued that athletes, as reader-producers who are hailed by and operate within the commercial mediasport complex, are subject to and perpetuate the interpellative power of mediasport and the consumerist ideology it supports. © The Author(s) 2017.","#WeDemandChange; amateurism; commodification; mediasport interpellation; Olympics; social media; sponsorship",,,,,,,,,"Abeza, G., Pegorara, A., Naraine, M., Seguin, B., O’Reilly, N., Activating a global sport sponsorship with social media: An analysis of TOP sponsors, Twitter, and the 2014 Olympic Games (2014) International Journal of Sports Management and Marketing, 15, pp. 184-213; Andranovich, G., Burbank, M., Heying, C., Olympic cities: Lessons learned from mega-event politics (2001) Journal of Urban Affairs, 23, pp. 113-131; Bauman, Z., (2007) Consuming life, , Malden, MA, Polity Press; Belson, K., Olympians take to Twitter to protest endorsement rule (2012) New York Times, p. 11. , 7, 31, (,)., p; Billings, A., Power in the reverberation: Why Twitter matters, but not the way most believe (2014) Communication & Sport, 2, pp. 107-112; Broadbent, R., We should be paid to take part, US athlete demands (2012) The Times, 7. , 7, 31, (,)., p; (2016) Rule 40, , http://rule40.com/, Retrieved from, (, a; (2016) Athletes, while you were kicking ass during the blackout period, we were taking names. congratulations to all of the Rio Olympic medalists.

In this article, we draw on the work of those who suggest that mediatization is best deployed as a means of understanding particular social domains and the ways in which institutions and actors orientate their activities towards media. Using association football, or soccer, as our focus we offer a bottom-up perspective using data gathered from research workshops with young people in England. These not only demonstrate the extent to which football is followed through a range of media platforms but also how broader understandings of the game are shaped by these engagements. Moreover, we adapt insights from recent phenomenological approaches to media to focus on the practical, embodied forms of knowledge and habit that shape how football is currently played, followed, and debated. © The Author(s) 2017.","communication; football; media; mediatization; young people",,,,,,"Arts and Humanities Research Council

In following the development of spatial practice, the discourses of territoriality in pre-match communication are explored, and it is shown how the team uses spatial and linguistic practice to reconstruct an unfamiliar space as “home,” thus allowing them to create a familiar space through ritual wherever they might be. In analysing the discourses and communicative practices present in the locker room, the construction of hegemonic masculinity is also discussed and it is found that while rugby is still inextricably bound up with hegemonic masculine ideology, these are found to a much lesser degree than elsewhere. © The Author(s) 2017.","ethnography; interactional sociolinguistics; masculinities; rugby; spatial practice",,,,,,"Victoria University of Wellington","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: The data used in this paper was originally collected for research funded by a Doctoral Assistantship from Victoria University of Wellington, New Zealand.",,"Adams, A., Anderson, E., McCormack, M., Establishing and challenging masculinity: The influence of gendered discourses in organized sport (2010) Journal of Language and Social Psychology, 29, pp. 278-300; Ainsworth, S., Grant, D., Iedema, R., ‘Keeping things moving’: Space and the construction of middle management identity in a post-NPM organization (2009) Discourse & Communication, 3, pp. 5-26; Anderson, E., (2009) Inclusive masculinity: The changing nature of masculinities, , New York, NY, Routledge; Anderson, E., McGuire, R., Inclusive masculinity theory and the gendered politics of men’s rugby (2010) Journal of Gender Studies, 19, pp. 249-261; Atkinson, P., Hammersley, M., Ethnography and participant observation (1994) Handbook of qualitative research, pp. 248-261. , Denzin N.K., Lincoln Y.S., (eds), Thousand Oaks, CA, Sage, (Eds.), (., –; Becker, K., /r/ and the construction of place identity on New York City’s Lower East Side (2009) Journal of Sociolinguistics, 13, pp. 634-658; Bryson, L., Sport and the maintenance of masculine hegemony (1987) Women’s Studies International Forum, 10, pp. 349-360; Bucholtz, M., Hall, K., Theorizing identity in language and sexuality research (2004) Language in Society, 33, pp. 469-515; Bucholtz, M., Hall, K., Identity and interaction: A sociocultural linguistic approach (2005) Discourse Studies, 7, pp. 585-614; Choi, S., Schnurr, S., Exploring distributed leadership: Solving disagreements and negotiating consensus in a ‘leaderless’ team (2014) Discourse Studies, 16, pp. 3-24; Connell, R., (2005) Masculinities, , 2nd ed, Berkeley, University of California Press; Curry, T.J., Fraternal bonding in the locker room: A profeminist analysis of talk about competition and women (1991) Sociology of Sport Journal, 8, pp. 119-135; Curry, T.J., Beyond the locker room: Campus bars and college athletes (1998) Sociology of Sport Journal, 15, pp. 205-215; Daly, N., Holmes, J., Newton, J., Stubbe, M., Expletives as solidarity signals in FTAs on the factory floor (2004) Journal of Pragmatics, 36, pp. 945-964; DuBois, J., The stance triangle (2007) Stancetaking in discourse: Subjectivity, evaluation, interaction, pp. 139-182. , Englebretson R., (ed), Amsterdam, The Netherlands, John Benjamins, (Ed.), (., –; Dunning, E.G., Sport as a male preserve: Notes on the social sources of masculine identity and its transformations (1986) Theory Culture Society, 3, pp. 79-90; Duranti, A., Language and bodies in social space: Samoan ceremonial greetings (1992) American Anthropologist, 94, pp. 657-691; Duranti, A., Goodwin, C., (1992) Rethinking context: Language as an interactive phenomenon, , Cambridge, MA, Cambridge University Press; Eckert, P., Variation and the indexical field (2008) Journal of Sociolinguistics, 12, pp. 453-476; Eckert, P., McConnell-Ginet, S., (2003) Language and gender, , Cambridge, MA, Cambridge University Press; Ervin-Tripp, S., Is Sybil there?

These triggers were associated with athletes’ subsequent expressions of dissent. Athletes most commonly utilized solution presentation and direct-factual appeals when dissenting about these triggers. Athletes’ dissent messages predicted the success of their dissent; effective expressions more readily featured solution presentation messages, direct-factual appeals, and an absence of humor. Appropriate expressions were predicted by the use of solution presentation messages and the avoidance of pressure, circumvention, and humor. Collectively, this research highlights features unique to the sports team context, including team interdependence, the balancing of the multiple roles that come with being a student-athlete, and cultures of rationalism and respect for authority and sporting norms. © The Author(s) 2017.","athlete dissent; dissent; sport communication; triggering events",,,,,,,,,"Camiré, M., Forneris, T., Trudel, P., Bernard, D., Strategies for helping coaches facilitate positive youth development through sport (2011) Journal of Sport Psychology in Action, 2, pp. 92-99; Canary, D.J., Spitzberg, B.H., Appropriateness and effectiveness perceptions of conflict strategies (1987) Human Communication Research, 14, pp. 93-118; Cohen, J., A coefficient of agreement for nominal scales (1960) Educational and Psychological Measurement, 20, pp. 37-46; Cranmer, G.A., A continuation of sport teams from an organizational perspective: Predictors of athlete-coach leader-member exchange (2016) Communication & Sport, 4, pp. 43-61; Cranmer, G.A., Brann, M., It makes me feel like I am an important part of this team”: An exploratory study of coach confirmation (2015) International Journal of Sport Communication, 8, pp. 193-211; Cranmer, G.A., Buckner, M., High school athletes’ relationships with head coaches and teammates as predictors of their expressions of upward and lateral dissent (2017) Communication Studies, 68, pp. 37-55; Cranmer, G.A., Goodboy, A.K., Power play: Coach power use and athletes’ communicative evaluations and responses (2015) Western Journal of Communication, 79, pp. 614-633; Cranmer, G.A., Myers, S.A., Sports teams as organizations: A leader-member exchange perspective of player communication with coaches and teammates (2015) Communication & Sport, 3, pp. 100-118; Cranmer, G.A., Myers, S.A., Exploring Division-I student-athletes’ memorable messages from their anticipatory socialization (2017) Communication Quarterly, 65, pp. 125-143; Cranmer, G.A., Sollitto, M., Sport support: Received social support as a predictor of athlete satisfaction (2015) Communication Research Reports, 32, pp. 253-264; Durbin, J., Watson, G.S., Testing for serial correlation in least squares regression.

In Step 1 of the study, participant provided narratives (n = 49) about their motivations for using Snapchat to follow sports. In Step 2, an online survey asked participants (N = 263) to respond to 39 motive statements gleaned from narratives obtained in Step 1 as well as measures of points of attachment (POA), overall time spent viewing a variety of sports, and to rank the importance of various social media channels. Overall, four motives for using Snapchat to follow sports were conceptualized across 21 items (i.e., ease and convenience, behind the scenes, vicarious experience, unique points of view). Next, using regression analyses, we found that age, POA, social media preferences, and different sports viewed predicted motives for using Snapchat to follow sports to varying degrees.

Complementing previous research, it is argued in this article that identification with the national in-group should be enhanced especially among emotionally involved spectators. Emotional involvement, however, can be induced by the sport itself but also by an emotionalized framing of the events by the media. Two studies are presented which test these claims: In Study #1, it is shown that a single, victorious Federation Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) World Cup match suffices to increase national identification among emotionally highly involved subjects, whereas no effects are revealed for individuals with lower emotional involvement. In Study #2, participants reported higher levels of national identification and associated Germany with more positive emotions and values after watching a highly emotional and patriotic broadcast of a kayak competition from the 2016 Summer Olympic Games compared to individuals who had watched the same competition with a factual and neutral commentary. It is concluded from both studies that emotional involvement is a key mechanism through which higher levels of national identification are produced in the realm of sport. © The Author(s) 2017.","collective emotions; identification; national identity; nationalism; patriotism",,,,,,"Bundesinstitut fÃ¼r Sportwissenschaft, BISp: 070093/15-17","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This study received funding from the German Federal Institute of Sport Science (Grant Number: 070093/15-17).

However, how role ambiguity evolves over time and is managed is understudied. This qualitative longitudinal investigation examined how role ambiguities emerged and impacted the members of a National Collegiate Athletic Association Division I collegiate men’s basketball team. Working within the organizational tensions theoretical framework, data on role ambiguity were collected through participant observation and ethnographic interviews and thematically coded and analyzed. Findings indicated that role ambiguities, such as with player leadership, were influenced by numerous contextual factors and recursively influenced the meanings of some of those factors. These complexities also produced tensions, and members’ attempts to manage these tensions produced dualities that further increased role ambiguity. When members realized they could not resolve ambiguities related to their roles, they concocted unorthodox role management strategies to accomplish their responsibilities amidst the ambiguity. © 2017, The Author(s) 2017.","duality; participant observation; role ambiguity; role management; sports team; tensions",,,,,,,,,"Balaguer, I., Duda, J.L., Atienza, F.L., Mayo, C., Situational and dispositional goals as predictors of perceptions of individual and team improvement, satisfaction and coach ratings among elite female handball teams (2002) Psychology of Sport and Exercise, 3, pp. 293-308; Bar-Eli, M., Tractinsky, N., Criticality of game situations and decision making in basketball: An application of performance crisis perspective (2000) Psychology of Sport and Exercise, 1, pp. 27-39; Barge, J.K., Lee, M., Maddux, K., Nabring, R., Townsend, B., Managing dualities in planned change initiatives (2008) Journal of Applied Communication Research, 36, pp. 364-390; Beauchamp, M.R., Bray, S.R., Role ambiguity and role conflict within interdependent teams (2001) Small Group Research, 32, pp. 133-157; Beauchamp, M.R., Bray, S.R., Eys, M.A., Carron, A.V., Role ambiguity, role efficacy, and role performance: Multidimensional and mediational relationships within interdependent sport teams (2002) Group Dynamics: Theory, Research, and Practice, 6, pp. 229-242; Beauchamp, M.R., Bray, S.R., Eys, M.A., Carron, A.V., Leadership behaviors and multidimensional role ambiguity perceptions in team sports (2005) Small Group Research, 36, pp. 5-20; Blumer, H., (1969) Symbolic interactionism: Perspective and method, , Englewood Cliffs, NJ, Prentice Hall, 1998, (, /; Bogdewic, S.P., Participant observation (1992) Doing qualitative research, 2, pp. 47-70. , Crabtree B.F., Miller W.L., (eds), Thousand Oaks, CA, Sage, (Eds.), (.,., –; Bray, S.R., Brawley, L.R., Role clarity, role efficacy, and role performance effectiveness (2002) Small Group Research, 33, pp. 245-265; Brenner, J., Keating, P., (2015) Beat the odds: Anatomy of the upset, , 3, Panel discussion conducted at the meeting of the M.I.T Sloan Sports Analytics Conference, Boston, MA; Browning, B.W., Team in transition: An ethnographic case-study highlighting cohesion and leadership in a collegiate athletic team (2007) Dissertation Abstracts International, 69 (01A). , Doctoral dissertation, (UMI No. 304729911; Cope, C.J., Eys, M.A., Beauchamp, M.R., Schinke, R.J., Bosselut, G., Informal roles on sport teams (2011) International Journal of Sport and Exercise Psychology, 9, pp. 19-30; Cranmer, G.A., Myers, S.A., Sports teams as organizations: A leader-member exchange perspective of player communication with coaches and teammates (2015) Communication & Sport, 3, pp. 100-118; Eisenberg, N., Emotion-related regulation (2006) The crisis in youth mental health: Critical issues & effective programs, 1, pp. 133-155. , Fitzgerald H.E., Lester B.M., Zuckerman B., (eds), Westwood, CT, Prager, (Eds.), (.,., –; Emerson, R.M., Fretz, R., Shaw, L., (1995) Writing ethnographic fieldnotes, , Chicago, IL, University of Chicago Press; Eys, M.A., Beauchamp, M.R., Bray, S.R., A review of team roles in sport (2006) Literature reviews in sport psychology, pp. 227-256. , Hanton S., Mellalieu S.D., (eds), Hauauge, NY, Nova Science, (Eds.), (., –; Eys, M.A., Carron, A.V., Role ambiguity, task cohesion, and task self-efficacy (2001) Small Group Research, 32, pp. 356-373; Eys, M.A., Carron, A.V., Beauchamp, M.R., Bray, S.R., Athletes’ perceptions of the sources of role ambiguity (2005) Small Group Research, 36, pp. 383-403; Fisher, B.A., Ellis, D.G., (1990) Small group decision making: Communication and the group process, , 3rd ed, New York, NY, McGraw-Hill; Giddens, A., (1984) The constitution of society: Outline of the theory of structuration, , Berkeley, University of California Press; Hatch, M.J., Irony and the social construction of contradiction in the humor of a management team (1997) Organizational Science, 8, pp. 275-288; Johnson, S.C., Long, L.M., Being a part and being apart”: Dialectics and group communication (2002) New directions in group communication, pp. 25-42. , Frey L., (ed), Thousand Oaks, CA, Sage, (Ed.), (., –; Kahn, R.L., Wolfe, D.M., Quinn, R.P., Snoek, J.D., Rosenthal, R.A., (1964) Organizational stress: Studies in role conflict and ambiguity, , Oxford, England, John Wiley; Kang, P., (2012) The march of madness: A communication approach to understanding the quality of teamwork in a collegiate basketball team, , (Doctoral dissertation).

A content analysis was conducted examining how NFL teams communicate their CSR efforts on Facebook using Charity Support Behaviors (CSB) and framing as our guide and then measuring which of these types of social media posts were most effective for increasing positive social media engagement. The extent that each team’s season record affected CSR messaging was also examined, underscoring the importance of winning and losing and its effect on social media engagement. The results of this study yield a comprehensive analysis of the types and frequency of messages used to communicate CSR activity on Facebook. Results provide best-practice recommendations for sports organizations using social media to communicate activities to external stakeholders (i.e., fans) that will benefit the cause and increase positive social media engagement (e.g., likes, shares, and comments). © 2017, The Author(s) 2017.","breast cancer awareness month; charity support behaviors; corporate social responsibility; framing; team identification",,,,,,,,,"An, S.K., Gower, K.K., How do the news media frame crises?

It was the first sexual crime involving a National Rugby League (NRL) player to be reported since Brett Stewart was acquitted of sexual assault in 2010, and reporting of previous cases focused largely on footballers’ attitudes towards women, women’s behaviour towards footballers, and use of alcohol. Using mixed methods discourse analysis, this article shows that the first 2 weeks of print media reporting created a frame for the case that had nothing to do with sexual crime, attitudes towards women, or gender relations. Although Ferguson had a history of inappropriate behaviour towards women, and alcohol abuse, the alcohol frame was almost unanimously chosen, marginalising the sexual crime and Ferguson’s actual victim. In contrast to reporting of previous cases, the focus was overwhelmingly on the impact on Ferguson’s career, his well-being and the game (including teammates, fans, and the NRL). The primacy of sport, and use of language to represent the case, impedes serious consideration of problematic attitudes towards women and the seriousness of sexual crime. © 2017, The Author(s) 2017.","Australia; gender; news frames; rugby league; sexual assault",,,,,,,,,"Albury, K., Carmody, M., Evers, C., Lumby, C., Playing by the rules: Researching, teaching and learning sexual ethics with young men in the Australian rugby league (2011) Sex Education: Sexuality, Society and Learning, 11, pp. 339-351; Andon, P., Free, C., Auditing and crisis management: The 2010 Melbourne Storm salary cap scandal (2012) Accounting, Organizations and Society, 37, pp. 131-154; Baird, B., Morality and patriarchal white sovereignty (2009) International Feminist Journal of Politics, 11, pp. 372-391; Benedict, H., (1992) Virgin or vamp: How the press covers sex crimes, , Oxford, England, Oxford University Press; Bielefeld, S., The “intervention” legislation - “just” terms or “reasonable” injustice?: Wurridjal v The Commonwealth of Australia (2010) Australian Indigenous Law Review, 14, pp. 2-23; Bielefeld, S., Compulsory income management and indigenous Australians: Delivering social justice or furthering colonial domination?

A path analysis was conducted to empirically test relationships between personality, team identity, and BIRGing/CORFing behaviors using the Honesty-Humility emotionality extraversion agreeableness conscientiousness openness to experience (HEXACO)-Personality Inventory (HEXACO-PI), Sport Spectator Identification Scale, and BIRGing and CORFing scales. The HEXACO-PI provides a theoretical framework to examine the degree to which six broad personality domains and several underlying personality traits influence behavior. A survey utilizing a national sample of 715 participants indicates several narrow underlying personality traits predict BIRGing and CORFing behaviors. Using this personality framework presents a new area of research for sport communication theories. The practical applications and future research examining the role of personality in sport communication and sport marketing is offered in conclusion. © 2017, The Author(s) 2017.","BIRGing; CORFing; HEXACO-PI; personality; team identity",,,,,,,,,"Ashforth, B., Mael, F., Social identity theory and the organization (1989) Academy of Management Review, 14, pp. 20-39; Ashton, M.C., (2013) Individual differences and personality, , San Diego, CA, Academic Press; Ashton, M.C., Lee, K., Empirical, theoretical, and practical advantages of the HEXACO model of personality structure (2007) Personality and Social Psychology Review, 11, pp. 150-166; Ashton, M.C., Lee, K., The HEXACO-60: A short measure of the major dimensions of personality (2009) Journal of Personality Assessment, 91, pp. 340-345; Ashton, M.C., Lee, K., Perugini, M., Szarota, P., De Vries, R.E., Di Blas, L., A six-factor structure of personality-descriptive adjectives: solutions from psycholexical studies in seven languages (2004) Journal of personality and social psychology, 86, pp. 356-366. , …; Bouchard, T.J., Loehlin, J.C., Genes, evolution, and personality (2001) Behavior Genetics, 31, pp. 243-273; Brandon, D.M., Long, J.H., Loraas, T.M., Mueller-Phillips, J., Vansant, B., Online instrument delivery and participant recruitment services: Emerging opportunities for behavioral accounting research (2014) Behavioral Research in Accounting, 26, pp. 1-23; Cialdini, R.B., Borden, R.J., Thorne, A., Walker, M.R., Freeman, S., Sloan, L.R., Basking in reflected glory: Three (football) field studies (1976) Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 34, p. 366; Cialdini, R.B., De Nicholas, M.E., Self-presentation by association (1989) Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 57, p. 626; Clark, L.A., Watson, D., Constructing validity: Basic issues in scale development (1995) Psychological Assessment, 7, pp. 309-319; Cortina, J.M., What is coefficient alpha?

In this color-blind world, race is either a thing of the past or something we can choose to ignore. One location of such rhetoric is in sports. This mixed-methods study offers a rare examination of color-blind rhetoric among 365 college students at a Division I school that is a part of one of the power conferences. We administered a 20-question multiple-choice and open-ended survey accessing students’ views about race in college football and its athletes. Our open-coded responses were consistent with Bonilla-Silva’s color-blind racism frames. The frames students use are consistent with previous work that suggests that they envision a world in which overt attention to race is secondary to traditional aspects of American life, such as work ethic, meritocracy, individualism, and cultural differences.

However, recent instances involving issues related to race and crime in sport have prompted us to consider the prevalence of a Black criminal stereotype among sport fans. With increased media attention given to off-field transgressions—particularly, violent ones perpetuated by high-profile Black athletes—we are left wondering how such attention may influence fans’ attitudes and beliefs. We explored these issues in an experimental study (n = 234). Our findings not only revealed evidence of a Black criminal stereotype among sports fans but also that sports fans differ from nonfans in basic attitudes and beliefs about crime and violence in sport. More specifically, the more a participant claimed to be a fan of sports and (more so) combative sports, the more she or he viewed an athlete charged with domestic abuse in a favorable light. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.","Black criminal stereotype;

First, this study will specifically examine criminal transgressions by comparing the effectiveness of image repair attempts by athletes facing domestic violence charges compared to other crimes. Second, this study will look at the effectiveness of using the mortification (apology) strategy in combination with other predominant strategies used by athletes in order to repair one’s image. Using a 3 × 8 factorial experiment involving 490 participants, results showed that athletes facing domestic violence charges are perceived more negatively regardless of their response to the transgression. In addition, results also showed that using mortification in combination with corrective action is the best response for athletes, regardless of the crime. Finally, using the mortification strategy in combination with other strategies is more effective to repair an athlete’s image, suggesting that it may be better to use combination strategies to respond to transgressions. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.","athlete image repair; combination strategies; criminal transgressions; experiment; mortification",,,,,,"University of Alabama, UA: RG14639","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This study was supported by the Research Grants Committee at The University of Alabama under Grant RG14639.",,"(2016) Top sports sites, , http://www.alexa.com/topsites/category/Top/Sports, Retrieved March 14, 2016, from; Anderson, K., Gender, status and domestic violence: An integration of feminist and family violence approaches (1997) Journal of Marriage and the Family, 59, pp. 655-669; Arendt, F., Toward a dose-response account of media priming (2015) Communication Research, 42, pp. 1089-1115; (2016) Arrest Nation: The Sports Arrests Database, , http://www.arrestnation.com/sports, [archive].

This article uses Socialization Resources theory to argue that student-athletes’ leader-member exchanges with coaches and team-member exchanges with teammates provide them with important resources that assist in their socialization. Data collected from 160 Division-I student-athletes from five universities demonstrated that portions of their understandings of team history, politics, and values and goals are accounted for by their exchange relationships. In particular, exchanges with assistant coaches and teammates appear to be most salient within student-athletes’ socialization process. As such, this article provides insight regarding the social dynamics that shape collegiate athletes’ understandings of their environments. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.","college athletics; leader-member exchange; sport socialization; team-member exchange",,,,,,,,,"Banks, G.C., Batchelor, J.H., Seers, A., Boyle, E.H., Pollack, J.M., Gower, K., What does team-member exchange bring to the party?

This experiment also extends exemplification theory into the novel context of sports media by examining how one individual difference—domain-specific knowledge and interest in the subject—influences perceptions formed through a common message type, a sports highlight reel. Exemplification effects in the form of exaggerated football plays did indeed alter perceptions of the athlete despite concrete sport statistics depicting the athlete modestly. Interestingly, while the two concepts were positively correlated, they did not act uniformly. High knowledge sports fans were less swayed by exaggerated sports highlight exemplars when compared to their low knowledge counterparts while high and low fans categorized by self-identified interest did not affect the perceptions of the on-screen athlete.

This study examined the audience social media uses during the “most social Olympics” and found that demographics, personality, motivations, preference, media use routine, and viewing context significantly predicted social media consumption for the Rio Games. Olympics viewing on social media was predominately predicted by media use routine, while following and posting on social media about the Olympics appeared to be a more “active” choice that was shaped by personal identity and virtual schemas. In addition, results indicate that social media uses during the Rio Games neither “displaced” nor “encouraged” Olympics viewing on traditional television. Uses of social media suggest a digital expansion of “group” viewing and transform ways in which the audience can experience a sport mega-event. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.","audience research; media use during sport mega-events;

Research has indicated the importance of the parent/guardian’s role in athlete development and suggests parent/guardian communication may also have implications for athlete performance outcomes. Of such performance variables, self-efficacy has been demonstrated to have a consistent positive and moderate relationship with sport performance. The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of parent/guardian communication on student-athlete self-efficacy. Student-athlete participants (n = 290) provided self-reports of self-efficacy, family communication patterns, and the frequency-of-use and effectiveness of the efficacy-enhancing techniques employed by parent(s)/guardian(s). Results revealed a significant negative relationship between conformity-oriented communication and student-athlete self-efficacy. Regarding efficacy-enhancing techniques, the most frequently used and effective were reported as encouraging positive talk, parent/guardian acting confident themselves, and helping the student-athlete imagine optimal sport performance.

This study utilized confirmation theory to better understand the influence of coaches’ use of confirmation on athletes’ satisfaction and motivation to play their sport. Data collected from 132 former high school athletes indicated that the challenge dimension of coach confirmation uniquely and strongly predicts athletes’ satisfaction with their sport experiences, satisfaction with their communication with head coaches, and their motivation to play. These findings emphasize sport as a unique context of confirmation in which athletes prioritize their development and constructive criticism and demonstrate that confirmation is an effective coaching behavior that should be integrated into coaches’ everyday practices. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.","athlete–coach communication;

Olympians can thus become more powerful autonomous discursive actors, threatening traditional Olympic power dynamics that have protected lucrative Olympic media streams. And yet, Olympians have yet to use social media technology to fully exercise their autonomy. This article adopts a social construction of technology lens within a larger critical discourse analysis framework to analyze the reticent behavior of social media–enabled Olympians. It is suggested that their social media voices are constrained by a powerful set of obligations to their nation-state. These obligations can be understood as ritualistic deep play national proxy identifications, which are constructed and reinforced by Olympic policies and practices, as well as larger sociocultural contextual factors. This argument is explicated through an analysis of Olympics policy documents and case studies from the first two Olympiads, where social media had a major impact: the London 2012 Games and the Sochi 2014 Winter Games. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.","athletes; deep play; media events; nationalism; Olympics; social media; Twitter",,,,,,,,,"Adi, A., Miah, A., Open source protest: Human rights, online activism and the Beijing 2008 Olympic Games (2011) Transnational protest and the media: Toward global civil society, pp. 213-224. , Lester L., Cottle S., (eds), New York, NY, Peter Lang, In, (Eds.); Allison, L., Sport and nationalism (2000) Handbook of sports studies, pp. 344-355. , Coakley J., Dunning E., (eds), London, England, Sage, In, (Eds.); Angelini, J., MacArthur, P., Smith, L., Nationalism in the United States and Canadian primetime broadcast coverage of the 2014 Winter Olympics (2015) International Review for the Sociology of Sport; Arthur, B., And the gold for trash talking goes to…: Canadians show some welcome swagger (2014) National Post, pp. A1-A2. , 02, 06; Greece expels Olympic athlete over racist tweets (2012) CBS News, , http://www.cbsnews.com/news/greece-expels-olympic-athlete-over-racist-tweets/, 07, 25, Retrieved from; Bach, T., Opening ceremony 126th session (2014) International Olympic Committee, , https://stillmed.olympic.org/Documents/IOC_Executive_Boards_and_Sessions/IOC_Sessions/Sochi_2014_IOC_President_Bach_Speech_Session_Opening.pdf, 02, 04, Retrieved from; Bairner, A., Sport and the nation in the global era (2005) The global politics of sport, pp. 79-90. , Allison L., (ed), London, England, Routledge, In, (Ed.); Bajc, V., Olympic dilemmas: Surveillance, security, democracy (2015) Surveilling and securing the Olympics: From Tokyo 1964 to London 2012 and beyond, pp. 383-398. , Bajc V., (ed), London, England, Palgrave MacMillan, In, (Ed.); Billings, A., (2008) Olympic media: Inside the biggest show on television, , New York, NY, Routledge; Billings, A., Power in the reverberation: Why Twitter matters, but not the way most believe (2014) Communication & Sport, 2, pp. 107-112; Billings, A., Angelini, J., MacArthur, P., Smith, L., Vincent, J., Fanfare for the American NBC’s prime-time broadcast of the 2012 London Olympiad (2014) Electronic News, 8, pp. 101-119; Bond, A., Swiss footballer sent home from Olympics in disgrace for calling South Koreans ‘mongoloids’ on Twitter and saying they ‘can go burn’ after 2-1 defeat (2012) Daily Mail, , http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2181214/Olympic-football-2012-Michel-Morganella-sent-home-disgrace-calling-South-Koreans-mongoloids-Twitter.html, 07, 30, Retrieved from; Boykoff, J., (2014) Activism and the Olympics: Dissent at the games in Vancouver and London, , New Brunswick, NJ, Rutgers University Press; Boykoff, J., (2016) Power games: A political history of the Olympics, , London, England, Verso; Burchell, K., Infiltrating the space, hijacking the platform: Pussy Riot, Sochi protests, and media events (2015) Participations: Journal of Audience & Reception Studies, 12, pp. 659-676; Burchell, K., O’Loughlin, B., Gillespie, M., McAvoy, E., Soft power and its audiences: Tweeting the Olympics from London 2012 to Sochi 2014 (2015) Participations: Journal of Audience & Reception Studies, 12, pp. 413-437; Butterworth, M., The politics of the pitch: Claiming and contesting democracy through the Iraqi national soccer team (2007) Communication and Critical/Cultural Studies, 4, pp. 184-203; Castells, M., Communication, power and counter-power in the network society (2007) International Journal of Communication, 1, pp. 238-266; Chanavat, N., Desbordes, M., Towards the regulation and restriction of ambush marketing?

F1 events are staged promotional performances of local cosmopolitanism intended for a global audience and feature prominently in urban placemarketing strategies. Hosting such sport mega events is a constitutive feature of placemarketing strategies designed and implemented by host cities to join the ranks of “world-class” cosmopolitan cities. F1 motorsport is a representation of a particular conception of urban cosmopolitanism, one that embodies a fusion of sports entertainment, symbolic capital, and image into a single placemarketing product. The article concludes that the bombardment of visual signs advertising elite global mega brands constructs a specific identity for host cities anchored in a broad discourse of cosmopolitanism. This deployment of visual indicators is designed to link the image of F1 cities with the desired lifestyle markers that are constitutive features of the aesthetic of contemporary urban cosmopolitanism. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.","Formula One motorsport; local cosmopolitanism; placemarketing; spectacle; world-class city",,,,,,,,,"Bakhtin, M., (1984) Rabelais and his world, , Bloomington, Indiana University Press; Cook, I., Crang, P., The world on a plate: Culinary culture, displacement and geographical knowledges (1996) Journal of Material Culture, 1, pp. 131-153; Going swimmingly on the events front (2003) The Age, , 7, 14; Essaber, A., (1989) Neoliberalism, the Kennett regime and the identity of the city of Melbourne, , Unpublished Master’s thesis, University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Australia; Essaber, A., (1999) Neoliberalism, the Kennett regime and the identity of the city of Melbourne, , Master of Arts, University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Australia; Evans, C., The discursive representation of host locations in a sports event: Locating the ‘real site’ of Formula One (2014) Interactions: Studies in Communication & Culture, 5, pp. 231-245; Events, G.P., (2015) Australian F1 Grand Prix 2016, , http://www.grandprixevents.com/f1-races/australia, Retrieved from, (, a); Events, G.P., (2015) Grand Prix Events—Australia, Melbourne, , https://www.grandprixevents.com/f1-races/australia/about-melbourne, Retrieved from, (, b); Events, G.P., (2015) Grand Prix events hospitality—Melbourne 2016, , https://www.grandprixevents.com/f1-races/australia/corporate-hospitality, Retrieved from, (, c); Friedman, M.T., Andrews, D.L., Silk, M., Sport and the facade of redevelopment in the postindustrial city (2004) Sociology of Sport Journal, 21, pp. 119-139; Gezici, F., Er, S., What has been left after hosting the Formula 1 Grand Prix in Istanbul (2014) Cities, 41, pp. 44-53; Gibson, T., Lowes, M., The city as production, text, context (2007) Urban communication: Production, text, context, pp. 1-24. , Gibson T., Lowes M., (eds), New York, NY, Roman & Littlefield, (, a)., In, (Eds.); Gibson, T., Lowes, M., (2007) Urban communication: Production, text, context, , New York, NY, Roman & Littlefield, (Eds.).

Wallace uses three rhetorical tactics—providing knowledge to the reader as confidant, making meaning out of the athletic cliché, and translating the form of professional tennis into prose—that establish his cultural authority on tennis while positioning the athlete as a transcendent spiritual practitioner. This characterization redefines dominant understandings of the athlete’s relationship to religion and the spectator’s relationship to the athlete, while discarding the possibility of recognizing the athlete as citizen. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.","communication and sport; David Foster Wallace; occasional sportswriter; rhetorical criticism; sport and religion",,,,,,"Star Scientific Foundation","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: The author would like to thank Penn State’s College of the Liberal Arts for a Student Teaching and Research (STAR) grant that enabled him to visit the David Foster Wallace archives at the Harry Ransom Center at the University of Texas–Austin in March 2014.",,"Baker, W.J., (2007) Playing with God: Religion and modern sport, , Cambridge, MA, Harvard University Press; Bitzer, L., The rhetorical situation (1968) Rhetoric and Philosophy, 1, pp. 1-14; Brummett, B., (2009) Sporting rhetoric: Performance, games, politics, , New York, NY, Peter Lang, (Ed.); Brummett, B., Ishak, A., (2014) Sports and identity: New agendas in communication, , New York, NY, Routledge, (Eds.); Burke, K., (1969) A rhetoric of motives, , Berkeley, University of California Press; Burke, K., (Nonsymbolic) motion/(symbolic) action (1978) Critical Inquiry, 4, pp. 809-838; Butterworth, M., The passion of the Tebow: Sports media and heroic language in the tragic frame (2013) Critical Studies in Media Communication, 30, pp. 17-33; Butterworth, M., The athlete as citizen: Judgment and rhetorical invention in sport (2014) Sport in Society: Cultures, Commerce, Media, Politics, 17, pp. 867-883; Curtis, B., (2013) The devil’s dictionary of sportswriting, , http://grantland.com/features/the-sportswriter-dictionary/, 3, 6, Retrieved July 17, 2016, from; Curtis, B., (2014) Grantland dictionary: Sportscasting edition, , http://grantland.com/features/grantland-dictionary-sportscasting-ambrose-bierce-nfl-mlb-nba/, 11, 11, Retrieved July 17, 2016, from; Debord, G., (1983) Society of the spectacle, , Detroit, MI, Black & Red, Original work published 1967; DeLillo, D., Informal remarks from the David Foster Wallace memorial service in New York on October 23, 2008 (2012) The legacy of David Foster Wallace, pp. 23-24. , Cohen S., Konstantinou L., (eds), Iowa City, University of Iowa Press, In, (Eds.); Foucault, M., (2006) The hermeneutics of the subject: Lectures at the Collège de France, 1981-1982, , New York, NY, Picador, (, Trans.); Grossman, L., (2010) All-time 100 novels: Infinite Jest, , http://entertainment.time.com/2005/10/16/all-time-100-novels/slide/infinite-jest-1996-by-david-foster-wallace/, Retrieved from; Guttmann, A., (1978) From ritual to record: The nature of modern sports, , New York, NY, Columbia University Press; Hawhee, D., (2004) Bodily arts: Rhetoric and athletics in Ancient Greece, , Austin, University of Texas Press; Hawhee, D., (2012) Moving bodies: Kenneth Burke at the edges of language, , Columbia, University of South Carolina Press; Higgs, R.J., Muscular Christianity, holy play, and spiritual exercises: Confusion about Christ in sports and religion (1996) Aethlon, 14, pp. 359-386; Hoffman, S.J., (2010) Good game: Christianity and the culture of sport, , Waco, TX, Baylor University Press; Hutch, R.A., (2010) Sport as a spiritual practice: Mastery, failure, and transcendence in the life of athletes, , Lewiston, NY, Edwin Mellen Press; Kellner, D., (2003) Media spectacle, , New York, NY, Routledge; Khan, A., (2012) Curt Flood in the media: Baseball, race, and the demise of the activist athlete, , Jackson, University Press of Mississii; Lacayo, R., (2010) All-time 100 novels: How we picked the list, , http://entertainment.time.com/2005/10/16/all-time-100-novels/, Retrieved September 24, 2016, from; Ladd, T., Mathisen, J.A., (1999) Muscular Christianity: Evangelical Protestants and the development of American sport, , Grand Rapids, MI, Baker Books; MacDonald, G., (2009) Reading list: ‘The String Theory’ by David Foster Wallace, , http://straightsets.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/06/23/reading-list-string-theory-by-david-foster-wallace/, 6, 23, Retrieved October 27, 2016, from; Max, D.T., (2012) Every love story is a ghost story: A life of David Foster Wallace, , New York, NY, Viking; McGee, M.C., Text, context, and the fragmentation of contemporary culture (1990) Western Journal of Communication, 54, pp. 274-289; Montaz de Oca, J., Review of the book Religion and sports in American culture, by J.

Content analysis was performed on tweets from all 23 players on the U.S. Women’s National Soccer Team during 30-day time periods before, during, and after the 2015 World Cup. Findings revealed an overall tendency towards backstage communication, with some commonalities between the self-presentation styles utilized by individual athletes on the team. In addition, there were organic, intuitive changes in the players’ self-presentation across various time periods. Further, analysis of follower engagement via retweets indicated greater interest in athletes’ backstage communication compared to front stage. These findings yield implications for future research and practical application, which are examined in the discussion. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.","athletes; self-presentation; soccer; social media; Twitter",,,,,,,,,"Abeza, G., O’Reilly, N., Seguin, B., Nzindukiyimana, O., Social media scholarship in sport management research: A critical review (2015) Journal of Sport Management, 29, pp. 601-618; Blaszka, M., Burch, L., Frederick, E.L., Clavio, G., Walsh, P., #WorldSeries: An empirical examination of Twitter hashtag use during a major sporting event (2012) International Journal of Sport Communication, 5, pp. 435-453; Bruce, T., New rules for new times: Sportswomen and media representation in the Third Wave (2016) Sex Roles, 74, pp. 361-376; Bullingham, L., Vasconcelos, A.C., ‘The presentation of self in the online world’: Goffman and the study of online identities (2013) Journal of Information Science, 39, pp. 101-112; Chuck, E., A level playing field: Why the USA is so strong in women’s soccer (2015) NBC, , http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/world-cup/level-playing-field-why-usa-so-strong-womens-soccer-n385346, 07, 5, Retrieved from; Clavio, G., Kian, T.M., Uses and gratifications of a retired female athlete’s Twitter followers (2010) International Journal of Sport Communication, 3, pp. 485-500; Coche, R., What women’s soccer fans want: A Twitter study (2014) Soccer & Society, 15, pp. 449-471; Coche, R., Promoting women’s soccer through social media: How the US federation used Twitter for the 2011 World Cup (2016) Soccer & Society, 17, pp. 90-108; Cohen, J., Perse, E.M., (2003) Different strokes for different folks: An empirical search for different modes of viewer-character relationships, , 05, Paper presented at the annual meeting of the International Communication Association, San Diego, CA; Cooky, C., Messner, M.A., Hextrum, R.H., Women play sport, but not on TV: A longitudinal study of televised news media (2013) Communication & Sport, pp. 1-28; Das, A., U.S. Women’s Soccer players renew their fight for equal pay (2016) New York Times, , http://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/08/sports/soccer/us-womens-soccer-players-renew-their-fight-for-equal-pay.html, 07, 7, Retrieved from; Farneti, C., Merchandising and marketing women’s sports (2016) Women and sport, pp. 229-246. , Staurowsky’s E.J., (ed), Champaign, IL, Human Kinetics, In, (Ed.); Women’s World Cup Germany 2011 sets new TV viewing records (2011) FIFA.com, , http://www.fifa.com/womensworldcup/news/y=2011/m=7/news=fifa-women-world-cup-germany-2011-sets-new-viewing-records-1477957.html, 07, 20, Retrieved from; Filo, K., Lock, D., Karg, A., Sport and social media research: A review (2015) Sport Management Review, 18, pp. 166-181; Fink, J.S., Female athletes, women’s sport, and the sport media commercial complex: Have we really “come a long way baby”?

A full examination of 100% (over 14 hr) of CCTV’s broadcast coverage revealed that female athletes received less media attention in terms of clock time and name mentions. Regarding word-by-word commentary ascribed to the gymnasts, CCTV employees significantly devoted more descriptors related to personality and physicality to female athletes, indicating a noticeable deviation from the Chinese traditional gendered frame of depicting female athletes as tenacious fighters with their nonsport-related aspects rarely covered.

These incidents have been covered heavily by the Australian media and have facilitated commentary on violence and sport, rugby league culture, and whether rugby league players have a propensity for violence. From a total corpus of 933 articles, we critically engage with 190 news reports of domestic violence and focus on the way players and others contribute to media commentary about the incidence of domestic violence allegedly perpetrated by their teammates. Our guiding research question is: What is the character of public commentary expressed by rugby league players about incidents of domestic violence involving teammates? We identify four modes of reflexive commentary involving teammate representation that occur in the reporting of rugby league players accused of domestic violence offences. We argue that these four modes of representation articulate greater or lesser degrees of support or criticism between teammates about domestic violence and, even when critical, these discourses work to rearticulate the normative diminished reflexivity afforded men to publicly comment on and about other men. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.","domestic violence; homosociality; reflexive commentary; rugby league; sexual ethics; teammates",,,,,,,,,"Albury, K., Carmody, M., Evers, C., Lumby, C., Playing by the rules: Researching, teaching and learning sexual ethics with young men in the Australian National Rugby League (2011) Sex Education, 11, pp. 339-351; (2014) Violence against Women: Key Statistics, , http://anrows.org.au/publications/fast-facts/violence-against-women-key-statistics, Retrieved August 11, 2016, from; Balym, T., Lion-hearted Cronk gives rivals taste of what they are missing (2012) The Sunday Mail, p. 2. , 11, 11, p; Banyard, V.L., Plante, E.G., Moynihan, M.M., Bystander education: Bringing a broader community perspective to sexual violence prevention (2004) Journal of Community Psychology, 32, pp. 61-79; Berns, N., (2004) Framing the victim: Domestic violence, media and social problems, , New Brunswick, NJ, Aldine Transaction; Chammas, M., Bulldogs take stand on violence against women with White Ribbon tie-in (2014) The Canberra Times, p. 30. , 11, 21, p; Coates, L., Wade, A., Language and violence: Analysis of four discursive operations (2007) Journal of Family Violence, 22, pp. 511-522; Collins, T., (2013) Rugby’s great split: Class, culture and the origins of rugby league football, , Abion, England, Taylor & Francis; Colman, M., Holding the Line (2009) Weekend Courier, p. 16. , 7, 11, p; Connell, R.W., (2005) Masculinities, , 2nd ed, Cambridge, MA, Polity; Conway, D., High penalty count (2009) Townsville Bulletin, p. 42. , 3, 19, p; Corboz, J., Flood, M., Dyson, S., Challenges of Bystander intervention in male-dominated professional sport: Lessons from the Australian football league (2016) Violence Against Women, 22, pp. 324-343; Cover, R., Suspended ethics and the team: Theorising team sportsplayers’ group sexual assault in the context of identity (2013) Sexualities, 16, pp. 300-318; Cover, R., Sexual ethics, masculinity and mutual vulnerability (2014) Australian Feminist Studies, 29, pp. 435-451; Dorries, B., I know in myself I am a good bloke (2012) The Courier-Mail, p. 106. , 7, 27, p; Easteal, P., Bartels, L., Bradford, S., Language, gender and ‘reality’: Violence against women (2012) International Journal of Law, Crime and Justice, 40, pp. 324-337; Easteal, P., Holland, K., Judd, K., Enduring themes and silences in media portrayals of violence against women (2015) Women’s Studies International Forum, 48, pp. 103-113; Flood, M., Changing men: Best practice in sexual violence education (2006) Women Against Violence: An Australian Feminist Journal, 18, pp. 26-36; Flood, M., Involving men in efforts to end violence against women (2011) Men and Masculinities, 14, pp. 358-377; Flood, M., Dyson, S., Sport, athletes and violence against women (2007) No to Violence Journal, 4, pp. 37-46; Foster, Z., Looking at your partner with one eyebrow raised (2009) Daily Telegraph, p. 32. , 3, 14, p; Foucault, M., (1972) The archaeology of knowledge and the discourse on language, , New York, NY, Pantheon, Trans.); Fuller, G., Page Jeffery, C., ‘There is no Zyzz’: The subcultural celebrity and bodywork project of Aziz Shavershian (2016) Celebrity Studies, pp. 1-15; Garry, C., Lui: It’s about honour (2013) Townsville Bulletin, p. 52. , 8, 14, p; Harris, L., Why do sports clubs ignore victims?

This study sought to understand how coverage of the debate in 1974–1975 over the Title IX regulations helped shape discourse about the law with regard to intercollegiate athletics. Through a combination of archival research and qualitative media analysis, I identified arguments made by Title IX critics and advocates and analyzed coverage of the debate in the New York Times and the Washington Post, paying particular attention to the presence or absence of what Dunja Antunovic called conflict and celebratory narratives. I found that conflict narratives that reflected concerns of Title IX critics overwhelmed celebratory narratives as well as anticommercialism narratives that I also detected. I concluded that these newspapers allowed critics, led by the National Collegiate Athletic Association, to shape the discourse about the meaning of Title IX and its consequences, thereby reinforcing male dominance of the American sport culture and missing an opportunity to question the commercialization of intercollegiate athletics. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.","mass media and gender; mass media and sports; mass media and Title IX; qualitative media analysis; Title IX",,,,,,,,,"Acosta, R.V., Carpenter, L.J., (2014) Women in intercollegiate sport: A longitudinal, national study, thirty seven-year update, 1977–2014, , www.acostacarpenter.org, Unpublished manuscript.

Whereas many of these discussions are centered on the health effects experienced by former players, active National Football League (NFL) players often discursively minimize concussions. However, in March 2015, 24-year-old, San Francisco 49ers player Chris Borland voluntarily retired, specifically citing concerns about the health risks associated with concussions sustained while playing football. A textual analysis of 112 digital media and 187 print media articles revealed 10 frames that were used to discuss Borland’s decision. Analysis revealed that the most prominent frame used in media outlets was centered on the health risks and consequences of playing football, while other frames discussed parental choice and social mobility associated with football. The results suggest that decisions by NFL players with respect to concussions can be framed in the context of larger social and cultural issues. As this occurs, conversations around safety, masculinity, and football move beyond the microlevel of participation, capturing macrolevel elements, such as parental consent, socioeconomic status, and health prioritization that factor into football participation. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.","Chris Borland; concussions; football; media framing; sport and health",,,,,,,,,"Anderson, E., Kian, E.M., Examining media contestation of masculinity and head trauma in the National Football League (2012) Men and Masculinities, 15, pp. 152-173; Angelini, J.R., Billings, A.C., MacArthur, P.J., Bissell, K., Reichart Smith, L., Competing separately, medaling equally: Racial depictions of athletes in NBC’s primetime broadcast of the 2012 London Olympic Games (2014) Howard Journal of Communications, 25, pp. 115-133; Bigman, C.A., Social comparison framing in health news and its effect on perceptions of group risk (2014) Health Communication, 29, pp. 267-280; Billings, A.C., Angelini, J.R., MacArthur, P.J., Bissell, K., Smith, L.R., Brown, N.A., Where the gender differences really reside: The “big five” sports featured in NBC’s 2012 London primetime Olympic broadcast (2014) Communication Research Reports, 31, pp. 141-153; Billings, A.C., Eastman, S.T., Framing identities: Gender, ethnic, and national parity in network announcing of the 2002 Winter Olympics (2003) Journal of Communication, 53, pp. 569-586; Billings, A.C., Moscowitz, L.M., Rae, C., Brown-Devlin, N., The art of coming out: Traditional and social media frames surrounding the NBA’s Jason Collins (2015) Journalism & Mass Communication Quarterly, 92, pp. 142-160; (2016) Retires at 23, Citing Concussions, , http://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/bills/2016/04/06/aj-tarpley-retires-concussions/82729270/, Bills LB Tarpley, A.

While event attendance and media consumption has received a great deal of attention from researchers, there is growing understanding that sport fans interact with their favorite teams in numerous other ways. Little is known, however, of what constitutes the fanatical behavior of sport spectators. Thus, there is an opportunity to understand the impassioned actions of the sport fan population to provide marketers and media providers with a better understanding of how sport fans interact with team brands beyond direct consumption. The current study aimed to discover and develop an instrument to measure spectator sport team fanaticism. Two focus groups were utilized to uncover and generate items. Three samples and an expert review were then conducted to validate the instrument. The following four unique dimensions were uncovered and preliminarily validated: instigation, superstition, committed interaction, and vicarious impact. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.","fanaticism; measurement; segmentation; spectator sport; sport marketing",,,,,,,,,"Aggarwal, P., The effects of brand relationship norms on consumer attitudes and behavior (2004) Journal of Consumer Research, 31, pp. 87-101; Anderson, J.C., Gerbing, D.W., Structural equation modeling in practice: A review and recommended two-step approach (1988) Psychological Bulletin, 103, pp. 411-423; Armstrong, C.G., Delia, E.B., Giardina, M.D., Embracing the social in social media: An analysis of the social media marketing strategies of the Los Angeles Kings (2016) Communication & Sport, 4, pp. 145-165; Banister, E.N., Cocker, H.L., A cultural exploration of consumers’ interactions and relationships with celebrities (2014) Journal of Marketing Management, 30, pp. 1-29; Bentler, P., Comparative fit indexes in structural models (1990) Psychological Bulletin, 107, pp. 238-246; Brown, T.A., (2012) Confirmatory factor analysis for applied research, , New York, NY, Guilford Press; Byon, K.K., Zhang, J.J., Connaughton, D.P., Dimensions of general market demand associated with professional team sports: Development of a scale (2010) Sport Management Review, 13, pp. 142-157; Celuch, K., Taylor, S.A., Involvement with services: An empirical replication and extension of Zaichkowsky’s personal involvement inventory (1999) Journal of Consumer Satisfaction, Dissatisfaction, and Complaining Behavior, 12, pp. 109-122; Chung, E., Beverland, M.B., Farrelly, F., Quester, P., Exploring consumer fanaticism: Extraordinary devotion in the consumption context (2008) Advances in Consumer Research, 35, pp. 333-340; Churchill, G.A., A paradigm for developing better measures of marketing constructs (1979) Journal of Marketing Research, 16, pp. 64-73; Clark, L.A., Watson, D., Constructing validity: Basic issues in objective scale development (1995) Psychological Assessment, 7, pp. 309-319; Clavio, G., Walsh, P., Dimensions of social media utilization among college sport fans (2014) Communication & Sport, 2, pp. 261-281; Clotfelter, C.T., Die-Hard fans and the ivory tower’s ties that bind (2015) Social Science Quarterly, 96, pp. 381-399; Cooper, R., Tang, T., Fans, nonfans, and the Olympics: Predictors of audience’s multiplatform experience with the 2008 Beijing Games (2012) Mass Communication and Society, 15, pp. 506-524; Cronbach, L.J., Meehl, P.E., Construct validity in psychological tests (1955) Psychological Bulletin, 52, pp. 281-302; Davis, R., McGinnis, L.P., Conceptualizing excessive fan consumption behavior (2016) Journal of Retailing and Consumer Services, 28, pp. 252-262; Duck, S.W., Sants, H., On the origin of the specious: Are personal relationships really interpersonal states?

The event generated widespread news coverage, and journalists thus played a key role in situating the story of not only the law’s beginnings but its place in contemporary gender politics. This study examines the public memory of Title IX, as told in mainstream media outlets in the weeks surrounding the law’s anniversary. Using the concept of intersectionality as an analytical lens, we argue that the logic of Title IX at 40 gives rise to a narrative of progress that universalizes the experiences of girls and women and situates discrimination as an historic relic while also celebrating and rewarding apoliticism. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.","gender; intersectionality; privilege; sports journalism; Title IX",,,,,,,,,"(1998) Women’s Sports Foundation, , http://www.womenssportsfoundation.org/home/advocate/title-ix-and-issues/what-is-title-ix/title-ix-primer, Retrieved from; (2010) Breaking through barriers for women and girls: Position on equity in school athletics, , http://www.aauw.org/act/issue_advocacy/actionpages/titleix_athletics.cfm, Retrieved from; Acosta, R.V., Carpenter, L.J., (2014) Women in intercollegiate sport: A longitudinal study—Thirty-seven-year update 1977–2014, , http://webpages.charter.net/womeninsport/, Smith College Project on Women and Social Change and Brooklyn College of the City University of New York, Retrieved from; Alphonse, L., Do women today take Title IX for granted?

The purpose of this study was to examine the intrateam communication and cohesion relationship to determine which types of communication would be associated with perceived task and social cohesiveness in a sample of youth athletes. Youth soccer players (N = 139, k = 13) completed measures of intrateam communication and task and social cohesion halfway through a competitive season. Separate multilevel analyses were run predicting task and social cohesion. For task cohesion, acceptance, positive conflict, and negative conflict communication emerged as significant predictors, p <.001, accounting for 40% of the total variance. For social cohesion, distinctiveness, positive conflict, and negative conflict communication were significant predictors, p <.001, accounting for 27% of the total variance. Findings provide initial evidence establishing a link between intrateam communication and cohesion in the youth sport context but more importantly suggest both similarities and differences with respect to the specific types of intrateam communication that are associated with task and social cohesion. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.","group dynamics; intrateam communication; perceived environment; team sport; youth",,,,,,"Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada, SSHRC","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This research was supported by the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada to the lead author.",,"Argyle, M., (1991) Cooperation: The basis of sociability, , London, England, Routledge; Bakar, H.A., Sheer, V.C., The mediating role of perceived cooperative communication in the relationship between interpersonal exchange relationships and perceived group cohesion (2013) Management Communication Quarterly, 27, pp. 443-465; Baker, M., Over half of psychology studies fail reproducibility test (2015) Nature, , http://www.nature.com/news/over-half-of-psychology-studies-fail-reproducibility-test-1.18248, Retrieved from; Carron, A.V., Brawley, L.R., Widmeyer, W.N., The measurement of cohesiveness in sport groups (1998) Advances in sport and exercise psychology measurement, pp. 213-226. , Duda, (ed), Morgantown, WV, Fitness Information Technology,.

Research that has examined why this is the case suggested this can be attributed to three particular factors that govern sports newswork: the male-dominated sports newsroom, ingrained assumptions about readership, and the systematic, repetitive nature of sports news. This study sought to explore women’s sports coverage using a different perspective, exploring cases where women’s sports gained coverage. It identified Australian newspapers that published more articles on women’s sports, relative to their competitors, and conducted interviews with both journalists and editors at these newspapers. It found that small, subtle changes to the three newswork elements that had previously relegated the coverage of women’s sports now facilitated it. This research provides evidence that, at least in some newspapers in Australia, sports newswork has developed to include the coverage of women’s sports. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.","gender; newspapers; newswork; sports media; women",,,,,,,,,"(2015) History, , http://www.anz-championship.com/About-Us/History, website article, Retrieved from; Bernstein, A., Is it time for a victory lap?: Changes in the media coverage of women in sport (2002) International Review for the Sociology of Sport, 37, pp. 415-428; Bruce, T., Assessing the sociology of sport: On media and representations of sportswomen (2015) International Review for the Sociology of Sport, 50, pp. 380-384; Bruce, T., New rules for new times: Sportswomen and media representation in the third wave (2016) Sex Roles, 74, pp. 361-376; Caple, H., Greenwood, K., Lumby, C., What league?: The representation of female athletes in Australian television sports coverage (2011) Media International Australia, Incorporating Culture & Policy, 140, pp. 137-146; Cooky, C., Messner, M.A., Musto, M., It’s dude time!”: A quarter century of excluding women’s sports in televised news and highlight shows (2015) Communication & Sport, , http://doi.org/10.1177/2167479515588761, Retrieved from; Cottle, S., Media organisation and production: Mapping the field (2003) Media organisation and production, pp. 3-24. , Cottle, (ed), London, England, Sage,.

One hundred thirty-seven people who either grew up in or currently resided in Northeast Ohio reported about their experiences when LeBron James announced he was leaving Cleveland to play in Miami in 2010, as well as their experiences when he announced his return to Cleveland in 2014. Results indicated the more intense a PSR with James was, the more invested in him individuals were. Additionally, experiencing a parasocial breakup was positively related to having feelings of grief after James left. The results of this study extend previous research on PSRs to a new realm and help explain why some sports fans might react negatively when finding out their favorite player is no longer playing with their favorite team. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.","betrayal; parasocial breakups; parasocial relationships; relational investment; sports communication",,,,,,,,,"Clevelanders celebrate LeBron James’ return, Miami owner “shocked (2014) CBS News, , http://www.cbsnews.com/news/lebron-james-returns-to-cavaliers-clevelanders-celebrate-miami-owner-shocked/, 7, 11, Retrieved from; Atkins, H., Lost stories of LeBron James, part 3 (2013) ESPN, , http://espn.go.com/nba/story/_/id/9825059/ohio-native-james-blair-proves-lebron-james-biggest-fan-espn-magazine, 109, Retrieved from; Auter, P.J., Palmgreen, P., Development and validation of a parasocial interaction measure: The audience-persona interaction scale (2000) Communication Research Reports, 17, pp. 79-89; Barker, B., LeBron James’ return with king’s ransom to Cleveland economy (2014) Newsday, , http://www.newsday.com/sports/basketball/lebron-james-return-worth-king-s-ransom-to-cleveland-economy-1.9561951, 109, Retrieved from; Branch, S.E., Wilson, K.M., Agnew, C.R., Committed to Oprah, Homer, or House: Using the investment model to understand parasocial relationships (2013) Psychology of Popular Media Culture, 2, pp. 96-109; Brown, T.A., (2015) Confirmatory factor analysis for applied research, , 2nd ed., New York, NY, The Guildford Press; Brown, W., Basil, M., Media celebrities and public health: Responses to “Magic” Johnson’s HIV disclosure and its impact on AIDS risk and high-risk behaviors (1995) Health Communication, 7, pp. 345-370; Brown, W.J., Steve Irwin’s influence on wildlife conservation (2010) Journal of Communication, 60, pp. 73-93; Brown, W.J., Basil, M.D., Bocarnea, M.C., Social influence of an international celebrity: Responses to the death of Princess Diana (2003) Journal of Communication, 53, pp. 587-605; Brown, W.J., Chaván de Matviuk, M.A., Sports celebrities and public health: Diego Maradona’s influence on drug use prevention (2010) Journal of Health Communication, 15, pp. 358-373; Five reasons why it isn’t hypocritical for Cavs fans to embrace LeBron James once again (2014) KLUC, , http://kluc.cbslocal.com/2014/07/14/five-reasons-why-it-isnt-hypocritical-for-cavs-fans-to-embrace-lebron-james-once-again/, 7, 14, Retrieved from; Cohen, E.L., Expectancy violations in relationships with friends and media figures (2010) Communication Research Reports, 27, pp. 97-111; Cohen, J., Parasocial breakups: Measuring individual differences in responses to the dissolution of parasocial relationships (2003) Mass Communication & Society, 6, pp. 191-202; Cohen, J., Mediated relationships and media effects: Parasocial interaction and identification (2009) The SAGE handbook of media processes and effects, pp. 223-236. , Nabi, Oliver, (eds), Thousand Oaks, CA, Sage,.

Without valid and reliable tools to assess athlete-coach interactions, understanding the antecedents and outcomes of these relationships, which is a central aim of sport communication research, cannot be accomplished. This article develops and demonstrates validity for a measure of the coach confirmation instrument (CCI) via two studies. In Study 1, an exploratory factor analysis and parallel analysis produced a 15-item, two-factor measure (challenge and acceptance). In Study 2, a confirmatory factor analysis confirmed this two-factor structure had an acceptable-to-good fit using a variety of fit indices. Additionally, preliminary degrees of validity for the CCI were demonstrated through Pearson correlations with athletes’ feeling of being confirmed, coach satisfaction, and perceptions of coach verbal aggression.

The word has been equated by some to a homophobic slur among the ranks of fag and faggot. American media and equality activists petitioned against the use of the word in Entertainment and Sports Programming Network and Univision broadcasts. Mexican soccer fans who used the word in a chant during matches argue that the word has no homophobic context in its use and is instead geared at distracting the opposing team. The Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) opened up an investigation into the use of the word by Mexican soccer fans and concluded that it was not a violation of their code of conduct and permitted its use; however, debate around the word still exists. Even though the debate was covered thoroughly by American media, stories failed to express the views and perspectives of those in support of the chant. The current study employed a textual analysis of tweets defending the chat that included the hashtag #FIFAputos. Employing the theoretical lens of McCormack’s homosexually themed language, the findings add nuance to the cultural, temporal, and spatial context of semantic meaning. Four themes also organically evolved from the analysis. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.","ethnic identity; FIFA; homosexually themed language; machismo; masculinity; Mexico; puto; soccer; Twitter; World Cup",,,,,,,,,"Aden, R.C., Reynolds, C.L., Lost and found in America: The function of place metaphor in sports illustrated (1993) Southern Journal of Communication, 59, pp. 1-14; Alabarces, P., Zucal, J.G., Moreira, M.V., El “aguante” y las hinchadas argentinas: Una relación violenta (2008) Horizontes Antropológicos, 14, pp. 113-136; Anderson, E., Openly gay athletes contesting hegemonic masculinity in a homophobic environment (2002) Gender & Society, 16, pp. 860-877; Anderson, E., (2005) In the game: Gay athletes and the cult of masculinity, , Albany, NY, SUNY Press; Anderson, E., (2009) Inclusive masculinity: The changing nature of masculinities, , New York, NY, Routledge; Anderson, E., The rise and fall of western homohysteria (2011) Journal of Feminist Scholarship, 1, pp. 80-94; Anderson, L., Lepore, E., Slurring words (2013) Nous, 47, pp. 25-48; Archetti, E., (1985) Fútbol y ethos, , Buenos Aires, Argentina, FLASCO; Armstrong, C.G., Delia, E.B., Giardina, M.D., Embracing the social in social media an analysis of the social media marketing strategies of the Los Angeles Kings (2014) Communication & Sport, 4, pp. 145-165; (2014) Mexico coach defends gay slur chant by crowd.

Further, women who have held positions in sport media are often perceived as being less credible than men in the field. In an effort to understand why these perceptions exist, the present study examined the influence of gender-role stereotyping and sexism on perceived sportscaster credibility. Using a posttest-only quasi-experimental design, 544 participants watched a video of a basketball debate between a male and female sportscaster, in addition to assessing the credibility of these sportscasters. Participant attitudes toward the sportscaster, gender-role stereotyping, and sexism as well as media consumption intentions were also measured. Results indicated that participants’ endorsement of gender stereotypes and level of sexism had a negative effect on the perceived credibility of the female sportscaster. Credibility was also found to have a significant relationship with attitudes toward the sportscaster, which in turn was related to media consumption intentions. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.","credibility; media consumption; sexism; social role theory; sport",,,,,,,,,"Acosta, R.V., Carpenter, L.J., (2014) Women in intercollegiate sport: A longitudinal national study, , http://www.acostacarpenter.org, Thirty-seven year update.

This study surveys 438 fantasy participants—some who play traditional fantasy sports and others who participate in daily fantasy sports along with traditional forms of fantasy offerings. Results reveal that motivations for play do not differ between traditional and daily participants, yet the two sets of respondents differed in terms of media consumption, economic commitment, and perceptions of games being skill versus chance based.

Professional cyclists must confront a suspicious public that often labels them as “dopers” and deviant. Drawing from interviews with professional cyclists, this article describes the interactional processes by which professional cyclists confront and manage stigma in everyday settings. Riders employed management techniques of distancing, educating, and normalization in attempts to repair a spoiled identity. Riders concurrently attempted to promote a positive new image of the sport, coalescing around the term Clean Cycling. In doing so, Clean Cycling functioned much like a commercial “brand” wherein riders position themselves as ambassadors of the Clean Cycling brand, building positive brand recognition among the public, while linking the brand to their own identity. Although not contesting the label of PED use as deviant, riders resisted the application of the “doper” label to themselves while attempting to redefine the procycling occupation as positive and worthwhile. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.","cycling; doping; sport; stigma; strategic communication",,,,,,,,,"Ahern, J., Stuber, J., Galea, S., Stigma, discrimination and the health of illicit drug users (2007) Drug and Alcohol Dependence, 88, pp. 188-196; Altheide, D., Deviance and the mass media (2015) The handbook of deviance, pp. 298-310. , Goode, (ed), New York, NY, John Wiley,.

However, the specific messages that coaches utilize to support athletes have remained overlooked. This study examines the memorable messages (i.e., enduring and influential messages) of informational, esteem, and emotional support that former high school athletes recall receiving from their head coaches. To accomplish this purpose, messages were inductively derived from 102 former high school athletes via open-ended questionnaires. These data were subjected to open and axial coding. Results indicate that athletes recall informational support messages that tell them how to play, be successful, and relate to others; esteem support messages that emphasize their abilities to succeed, encourage intangible qualities, and reinforce relationships with others; and emotional support messages that improve their well-being, praise them, help improve their performances, and deal with their poor performances. This study ultimately reinforces the use of message-based approaches for understanding athlete–coach interactions as well as highlights the specific types of prosocial messages that coaches can utilize to support athletes and improve their coaching effectiveness. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.","athlete–coach communication; memorable messages; social support; sport communication",,,,,,,,,"Barge, J.K., Schlueter, D.W., Memorable messages of newcomer socialization (2004) Western Journal of Communication, 68, pp. 233-256; Baugh, C.M., Kroshus, E., Daneshvar, D.H., Stern, R.A., Perceived coach support and concussion symptom-reporting: Differences between freshmen and non-freshmen college football players (2014) Journal of Law, Medicine, & Ethics, 42, pp. 314-322; Becker, A.J., It’s not what they do, it’s how they do it: Athlete experiences of great coaching (2009) International Journal of Sports Science & Coaching, 4, pp. 93-119; Bodie, G.D., Burleson, B.R., Explaining variations in the effects of supportive messages: A dual-process framework (2008) Communication yearbook 32, pp. 355-398. , Beck, (ed), New York, NY, Routledge,.

However, the proliferation of new media technologies is playing an evermore important role in the ongoing progression of skills among athletes and committed recreational participants, and building a sense of community among enthusiasts and audiences across local, national, and global contexts. More than repeating previous patterns, such media technologies are contributing to new relationships between corporations, action sporting bodies, and communities. This article sets out a research agenda for understanding new media developments in action sports. In the first part of this article, I detail how new digital media are being used by corporations, athletes, and everyday participants, and in so doing, are transforming the networks and connections within and across action sport communities. In the second, I describe how new media technologies such as GoPros™, camera drones, and GPS tracking devices are changing action sport experiences and the relationship between “human” and “nonhuman” sporting bodies. As well as revealing emerging issues, this article also poses a series of critical questions and challenges to researchers interested in contributing to new understandings of the latest media technologies in action sport cultures. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.","action sports; corporation; digital embodiment; drones; media spectacles; new technologies; social media",,,,,,,,,"Altsurfing.org history, , http://www.hisurfadvisory.com/ashub/as_history.htm, Retrieved from; Alvarez, E., (2015) ESPN is bringing camera drones to the X Games, , http://www.engadget.com/2015/01/21/espn-is-bringing-camera-drones-to-the-x-games/, Retrieved from; Andrews, S., 10 action sports athletes to follow on Instagram The Clymb, , http://www.theclymb.com/stories/out-there/action-sports-athletes-follow-instagram/, n. d., Retrieved from; Best of the best: The top 5 iPhone apps for surfers Surfers village, , http://www.surfersvillage.com/surfing-news/48123#.UmnDaY5x63A, n. d., Retrieved October 25, 2013, from; Booth, D., (Re)reading the surfers’ bible: The affects of Tracks (2008) Continuum: Journal of Media and Cultural Studies, 22, pp. 17-35; Borden, I., (2001) Skateboarding, space and the city: Architecture and the body, , London, England, Berg; Brohm, J.M., (1978) Prison of measured time, , London, England, Pluto Press; Byrne, B., New drone targets extreme selfie fans (2015) ValueWalk, , http://www.valuewalk.com/2015/05/new-drone-targets-extreme-selfie-fans/, Retrieved December 1, 2015, from; Clancy, R., Red Bull ‘worth £5bn’ after Felix Baumgartner skydive (2012) The Telegraph, , http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/retailandconsumer/leisure/9609231/Red-Bull-worth-5bn-after-Felix-Baumgartner-skydive.html, 10, 15, Retrieved May 19, 2013, from; Dayan, D., Katz, E., (1992) Media events: The live broadcasting of history, , Cambridge, MA, Harvard University Press; Dormehl, L., Drones will transform how you watch the Winter X Games (2015) Fast Company, , http://www.fastcompany.com/3041120/fast-feed/drones-will-transform-how-you-watch-the-winter-x-games, Retrieved from; (2015) eCoast Wins, , http://www.ecoast.co.nz/ecoast-wins-major-research-grant/, Retrieved from; Evers, C., Researching action sport with a GoPro™ camera: An embodied and emotional mobile video tale of the sea, masculinity and men-who-surf (2015) Researching embodied sport: Exploring movement cultures, pp. 145-162. , Weallard, (ed), London, England, Routledge, a).,.

While few have a deep level of knowledge of FIFA’s history or governance, this global story worked effectively as narrativized media characterization by often constructing a comic view of FIFA President Joseph S. Blatter. Although entertaining, this coverage mainly served to highlight the substantial failure of most of the news media, and especially of sports journalism, to deal seriously with the institutional politics of sport. This article analyses the media’s roles and responsibilities regarding sport as a key sociocultural institution and the media’s relationships with sports organizations, sportspeople, governments, commercial corporations, sport fans, and the wider citizenry. It considers the potential of sports communication and journalism education to change the dynamics of reporting everyday issues and eruptive scandals in sport. Ethical conduct in sport organizations and, particularly, in the hosting of mega sports events like the FIFA World Cup, should, it is argued, be addressed consistently by an inquiring and sceptical media. Above all, the media must beware of succumbing to the temptations of complacency and complicity in the games with which they are engaged. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.","FIFA; journalism; media; politics; scandal; sport governance",,,,,,,,,"Allan, S., Thorsen, E., (2014) Citizen journalism: Global perspectives, , New York, NY, Peter Lang; (2015) Promising little, delivering less: Qatar and migrant labor abuse ahead of the 2022 Football World Cup report, , http://www.amnestyusa.org/sites/default/files/qatar_may_2015_briefing_formatted_final_version.pdf, Retrieved from; (2010) FIFA’s dirty secrets, , http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00wfl8t, 11, 29, Retrieved from, a; (2010) England 2018 bid chief brands BBC as “unpatriotic, , http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/9201248.stm, 11, 17, Retrieved from, b; (2014) Qatar 2022: Sepp Blatter says corruption claims are racist, , http://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/27762435, 6, 9, Retrieved from, a; (2014) FIFA report “erroneous”, says lawyer who investigated corruption claims, , http://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/30037729, 11, 13, Retrieved from, b; Bennett, W.L., (2003) News: The politics of illusion, , 5th ed, New York, NY, Addison Wesley Longman; Blake, H., Calvert, J., (2015) The ugly game: The corruption of FIFA and the Qatari plot to buy the World Cup, , New York, NY, Scribner; Block, J., Sepp Blatter showered in cash by protestor during FIFA press conference (2015) The Huffington Post, , http://www.huffingtonpost.com.au/entry/sepp-blatter-fifa-cash_55acfe78e4b0d2ded39f5932?section=australia&adsSiteOverride=au, 7, 20, Retrieved from; Bowater, D., Whatever happened to Brazil’s World Cup protests?

An online qualitative survey was conducted with sport fans (n = 105) of four professional tennis events (Australian Open, Roland Garros, Wimbledon, and U.S. Open). Findings suggest that fans perceive the events’ usage of social media to be about three aspects: interaction, insight, and brand anthropomorphism. In addition, fan responses suggest that while Facebook is the most popular site for general social media usage, these fans consider Twitter to be their most preferred platform to follow the events. Finally, fan responses illustrate three barriers that brands need to overcome in order to successfully develop and execute their social media strategy: competition with other media, a lack of year-round incentives, and technological capabilities of the platforms, which ultimately influenced fans’ motives and use. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.","brand management; fan perceptions; social media; sport communication; tennis events",,,,,,,,,"Abeza, G., O’Reilly, N., Social media platforms’ use in building stakeholder relationships (2014) Journal of Applied Sport Management, 6, pp. 103-126; Abeza, G., O’Reilly, N., Reid, I., Relationship marketing and social media in sport (2013) International Journal of Sport Communication, 6, pp. 120-142; Aggarwal, P., McGill, A.L., When brands seem human, do humans act like brands?

The first section focuses on anniversaries, noting recent anniversaries of key works, the “coming of age” of the disciplinary area and the publication changes ahead for Communication and Sport as the journal enters its fifth year. The second section considers questions about disciplinary coherence for the study of communication and sport and points to key role that IACS can play in reconciling three distinct dispositions at play in scholarship: (1) media, sports, and society disposition; (2) sport communication as profession disposition; and (3) communication studies and sport disposition. The third section considers key challenges ahead for the study of communication and sport, calling attention to the need for the field to think globally, to avoid ethnocentrism, to grow and embrace an international scholarly agenda that reaches beyond the confines of the west, and to work to diversify and become an inclusive and interdisciplinary community of scholars. © The Author(s) 2017.","Communication and Sport; Communication studies and sport; Media; Mediated sport; Sociology of sport; Sport communication as a profession; Sports And society",,,,,,,,,"Cooky, C., Messner, M.A., Hextrum, R., It’s dude time!

Generalist broadsheet newspapers in 13 countries on five continents were examined over the course of 1 year (from August 2012 until September 2013) to understand the amount and content of coverage dedicated to this major event. Results show that the host country, Slovenia, dedicated the most extensive coverage to the EuroBasket, followed by Croatia, a neighboring country. Media interest in other countries was very limited and focused almost exclusively on competitive aspects of the tournament (as opposed to organizational, tourist, or cultural angles). Of the newspapers examined, only five covered the event in the months leading up to it and only four reported the final outcome of the tournament. Generalist broadsheets thus displayed limited interest in the competition, contradicting organizers’ assertions and popular belief of widespread promotional and economic benefits deriving from the event. Newspapers from countries that fielded teams at the event overwhelmingly focused on their performances. As setters of the public agenda, mainstream broadsheets exhibit very limited interest in the myriad major sports events organized worldwide. Hosting such events are not by default the promotional and economic boon organizers argue and the public believes. © The Author(s) 2016.","Basketball; Journalism; Major events; Mass media; Non-mega events",,,,,,,,,"Andranovich, G., Burbank, M.J., Heying, C.H., Olympic cities: Lessons learned from mega-event politics (2001) Journal of Urban Affairs, 23, pp. 113-131; Bijie, B., Billings, A.C., Too good to be true?

First, a rhetorical analysis examined the nationalistic themes featured in the game promotional ad of the United States versus Ghana soccer match in World Cup 2014, linking these themes to the republicanism/liberalism paradox in American political thought. Using the social identity perspective, we predicted the effects of these themes on U.S. participants’ nationalized attitudes and tested our hypotheses using an experiment. Experimental findings indicate that exposure to nationalistic rhetoric indirectly increases uncritical patriotism, critical patriotism, and support of militarism attitudes via self-enhancement gratifications. Additionally, exposure to nationalistic rhetoric also indirectly influences uncritical patriotism via social uncertainty reduction gratifications. Our study demonstrates the utility of a mixed-method approach and points out directions for future research on the (re)construction of social identities through mediasport. © The Author(s) 2016.","Nationalism; Social identity; Social identity gratifications; Sport; World cup",,,,,,,,,"Anderson, B., (1991) Imagined Communities: Reflections on the Origin and Spread of Nationalism, , London, England: Verso; Anderson, N.F., (2010) The Sporting Life: Victorian Sports and Games, , Santa Barbara, CA: Praeger; Atwell Seate, A., Mastro, D., (2015) Media’s Influence on Immigration Attitudes: An Intergroup Threat Theory Approach, , Communication Monographs.

Interviews of Division I athletes at an academically and athletically elite U.S. university uncovered that similar to employees in the retail and hospitality industries, who are paid to express particular emotions, student-athletes also had to perform emotional labor in order to meet institutional demands. Unlike paid workers, however, student-athletes are considered amateurs and do not receive a salary, and their behaviors are scrutinized most of the day, particularly if they are high-profile players. Despite the powerlessness, frustration, and nervousness student-athletes felt, they were expected to express mental toughness and gratitude. Participants coped with emotional labor demands by turning backstage and relying on teammates for social support. In addition to extending emotional labor research to a new context, this study offers several practical applications, underscoring the need for university athletics departments to prepare and assist student-athletes with the performance and negotiation of emotional labor. © The Author(s) 2016.","Communication; Display rules; Division I; Emotional labor; Impression management; Student-athletes",,,,,,,,,"Abraham, R., Emotional dissonance in organizations: Antecedents, consequences, and moderators.

FIFA’s response included President Sepp Blatter’s brief address to FIFA Congress. In the days that followed, Mr. Blatter also gave a television interview and appeared in other media events where he attempted to repair the organization’s image. The analysis focuses on the effectiveness of FIFA’s attempt at image repair. First, it uses Benoit’s image repair theory (IRT) to analyze FIFA’s rhetoric. Second, it conducts a thematic analysis of content from 215 publications in eight newspapers selected from four continents during three crises stages. The results indicate that FIFA failed in its attempt to repair its image following the corruption crisis. © The Author(s) 2016.","Corruption crisis; FIFA; Image repair; Sepp blatter; Thematic analysis",,,,,,,,,"Barnett, B., Framing rape: An examination of public relations strategies in the Duke University lacrosse case (2008) Communication, Culture & Critique, 1, pp. 179-202; Benoit, W., (1995) Accounts, Excuses, and Apologies: A Theory of Image Restoration Strategies, , New York: State University of New York Press; Benoit, W., Hugh Grant’s image restoration discourse: An actor apologizes (1997) Communication Quarterly, 45, pp. 38-57; Benoit, W., Another visit to the theory of image restoration strategies (2000) Communication Quarterly, 48, pp. 40-43; Benoit, W., (2015) Accounts, Excuses, and Apologies: Image Repair Theory and Research, , 2nd ed.).

A total of 19,649 tweets from 201 local sports broadcasters throughout the United States were examined using content analytic methods during a constructed 2-week period. Results demonstrated that while a majority of the local sports broadcasters did tweet about women’s sports, these tweets represented only about 5% of the overall number of messages. Further examination demonstrates that female sports broadcasters tweeted about women’s sports less frequently than male sports broadcasters did. Additionally, broadcasters in smaller cities were more likely to report about women’s sports than those in larger cities. While results are consistent with previous research on gender representation on nationally televised highlight shows, these findings are significant because they demonstrate that there is a relationship between gender of broadcaster and market size in relation to the number of tweets about women’s sports. Additionally, data are from Twitter, in which there are no time constraints that would seemingly limit the amount of women’s sports that could be mentioned by a sportscaster. © The Author(s) 2016.","Broadcasting; Gender; Media; Social identity theory; Sport",,,,,,,,,"Adams, T., Tuggle, C.A., ESPN’s SportsCenter and coverage of women’s athletics: It’s a boy’s club (2004) Mass Communication & Society, 7, pp. 237-248; Adornato, A.C., A digital juggling act: New media’s impact on the responsibilities of local television reporters (2014) Electronic News, 8, pp. 3-29; Ashforth, B., Mael, F., Social identity theory and the organization (1989) Academy of Management Review, 14, pp. 20-39; Baiocchi-Wagner, E.A., Behm-Morawitz, E., Audience perceptions of female sports reporters: A social identity approach (2010) International Journal of Sport Communication, 3, pp. 261-274; Barthel, M., Shearer, E., Gottfried, J., Mitchell, A., (2015), http://www.journalism.org/2015/07/14/the-evolving-role-of-news-on-twitter-and-facebook/, July 14The evoloving role of news on Twitter and Facebook; Billings, A.C., Young, B.D., Comparing flagship news programs: Women’s sport coverage in ESPN’s SportsCenter and FOX Sports 1’s Fox Sports Live (2015) Electronic News, 9, pp. 3-16; Blaszka, M., Burch, L.M., Frederick, E.L., Clavio, G., Walsh, P., #WorldSeries: An empirical examination of a Twitter hashtag during a major sporting event (2012) International Journal of Sport Communication, 5, pp. 435-453; Brown, N.A., Devlin, M.B., Billings, A.C., Fan identification gone extreme: Sports communication variables between fans and sport in the Ultimate Fighting Championship (2013) International Journal of Sport Communication, 6, pp. 19-32; Bruce, T., (2011) Shifting the Boundaries: Sportswomen in the Media, , http://www.anzca.net/documents/2011-conf-papers/486-bruce-anzca-2011-1/file.html, July, Paper presented at Australian & New Zealand Communication Association (ANZCA) 2011 Conference, Waikato, NZ; Bruce, T., Reflections on communication and sport: On women and femininities (2013) Communication & Sport, 1, pp. 125-137; Cooky, C., Messner, M.A., Hextrum, R.H., Women play sport, but not on TV: A longitudinal study of televised news media (2013) Communication & Sport, 1, pp. 203-230; Cooky, C., Messner, M.A., Musto, M., Its dude time!’’ A quarter century of excluding women’s sports in televised news and highlight shows (2015) Communication & Sport, 3, pp. 261-287; Cramer, J.A., Conversations with women sports journalists (1994) Women, Media, and Sport: Changing Gender Values, pp. 159-180. , In P.

Thus, a unique text corpus covering the period between 1950 and 2009 is analyzed using a corpus linguistic (CL) approach. It is shown that attention for doping has heavily increased and that doping has been marked as a persistent and widespread problem subject to permanent efforts of mitigation. However, there is little evidence for more alarmist moralizations. While quantitative CL techniques proved useful for tracing long-term changes in language use, assessing the role of media within the political economy of the moral regulation of doping requires a more ambitious mix of quantitative and qualitative methods. Nevertheless, the use of CL by scholars of sport communication is recommended, as CL methods are able to process large amounts of digitized data and are quite flexible in theoretical terms. © The Author(s) 2015.","Corpus linguistics; Discourse analysis; Doping; Germany; Moral regulation",,,,,,"Bundesinstitut fÃ¼r Sportwissenschaft, BISp: IIA1-081903A/09-12","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: Research presented here was partially supported by a grant from the Federal Institute for Sport Science (Bundesinstitut für Sportwissenschaft – BISp) for the project ‘Doping in Germany from 1950 until 2009’ [grant number IIA1-081903A/09-12].",,"Bachmann, I., Civil partnership—“gay marriage in all but name”: A corpus-driven analysis of discourses of same-sex relationships in the UK Parliament (2011) Corpora, 6, pp. 77-105; Baker, P., Representations of Islam in British broadsheet and tabloid newspapers 1999-2005 (2010) Journal of Language and Politics, 9, pp. 310-338; Baker, P., Gabrielatos, C., Khosravinik, K., Krzyzanowski, M., McEnery, T., Wodak, R., A useful methodological synergy?

This research, an in-depth case study based on semistructured interviews and analysis of all the relevant corporate documentation and online activity, aims at shedding light on how the new ASO management has refloated the race through a reinforcement of its globalization and mediatization, on the lines of the managerial policies already in place for the Tour de France since the early 80s. This article also proposes a small theoretical refinement of the “mega sporting event” concept, moving from a binary, yes-not typology, to a four-level scale including micro (local), meso (provincial/subnational), macro (national or regional), and mega (global) sporting events. In this sense, this article concludes that the communication strategies set up by the new ASO management have pushed the Vuelta beyond the macro and towards the mega level. © The Author(s) 2015.","Amaury Sport Organisation; Communication; Globalization; Mediatization; Mega sporting events; Professional road cycling; Tour de France; Vuelta Ciclista a España",,,,,,,,,"http://www.amaury.com/cyclisme.shtml; Balduck, A.-L., Maes, M., Buelens, M., The social impact of the Tour de France: comparisons of residents’ pre-and post-event perceptions (2011) European Sport Management Quarterly, 11, pp. 91-113; Barget, E., Couguet, J.J., The total economic value of sporting events, theory and practice (2007) Journal of Sports Economics, 8, pp. 165-182; Cazón, P., (2014) La Vuelta a España 2014 Le ganó En Las Audiencias Al Tour 2014, , http://ciclismo.as.com/ciclismo/2014/09/16/vuelta_espana/1410839132_949181.html; (2013) The Tour De France—Hosting the Grand départ, , http://democracy.york.gov.uk/documents/s79119/Tour%20de%20France%20-%20regional%20support%20SABs%20version%2022.01.13.pdf; (2014), http://www.biciciclismo.com/es/datos-que-asustan-asi-es-el-tour-de-francia-en-cifras-30-06-2014; Dayan, D., Katz, E., (1992) Media Events: The Live Broadcasting of History, , Cambridge, MA: Cambridge University Press; Dauncey, H., Hare, G., (2003) The Tour De France: a Century of Sporting Structures, Meanings and Values, , London, England: Frank Cass; Desbordes, M., A review of the economic impact studies done on the Tour de France: Methodological aspects and first results (2007) International Journal of Sport Management and Marketing, 2, pp. 526-540; Dolles, H., Söderman, S., Mega-sporting events in Asia—Impacts on society, business and management: An introduction (2008) Asian Business & Management, 7, pp. 147-162; Fallon, L., Bell, A., (2013) Viva La Vuelta, 1935-2013, , Norwich: Mousehold Press; Fandiño, X., (2002) La producción Del Ciclismo En TV [The TV Production of Cycling].

This case study explores the perceptions of print and online cricket journalists who covered the story, providing an analysis of how their emotions influenced their reporting of an event they were professionally and personally involved in. Employing this approach differs from the dominant focus of examining content in commemorative journalism scholarship. The circumstances of the Hughes story created an unfamiliar environment for cricket journalists, who had to deal with their own emotions while being messengers to audiences in Australia, and across the world. The impact of social media also altered the direction of aspects of the coverage through the Twitter hashtag #putoutyourbats. To examine elements of this commemorative journalism example, in-depth interviews were conducted with 11 Australian cricket journalists. The results reflect the respondents’ difficulties in covering the story, their usage of emotion in their work, and their perceptions of social media’s influence. © The Author(s) 2015.","Commemorative journalism; Cricket; Phillip Hughes",,,,,,,,,"Andrews, D., Jackson, S., (2001) Sport Stars: The Cultural Politics of Sporting Celebrity, , London, England: Routledge; (2014) Phillip Hughes Dominates Twitter in 2014, , http://www.smh.com.au/sport/cricket/phillip-hughes-dominates-twitter-in-2014-20141211-125kjb.html; Brenkley, S., Phil Hughes: A swashbuckling, raw and talented batsman who had the world at his feet (2014) The Independent, , http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/cricket/phil-hughes-head-injury-he-had-one-weakness--it-has-come-back-to-haunt-him-9883262.html; Carlson, M., Berkowitz, D., The late news: Memory work as boundary work in the commemoration of television journalists (2014) Journalism and Memory, pp. 195-209. , In Zelizer, B., Tenenboim-Weinblatt, K.

Considerable evidence from both within and beyond the context of sports suggests that a co-spectator’s behavior can generate “intra-audience effects” that enhance perceptions of and response to game events. To test this in the context of broadcast sports, an experiment was conducted whereby participants provided moment-to-moment evaluations of radio broadcasts of soccer where mediated spectator response was systematically altered. Results demonstrate mediated intra-audience effects that yielded both inflated perceptions of the exiting nature of play and increased sense of spatial immersion in the mediated environment. The effect was most pronounced when game events were not intrinsically exciting. © The Author(s) 2015.","Enjoyment; Immersion; Media effects; Sports broadcasting",,,,,,,,,"Adelmann, P.K., Zajonc, R.B., Facial efference and the experience of emotion (1989) Annual Review of Psychology, 40, pp. 249-280; Andrews, P., (2011) The Sound of Sports [Radio Program], , 99percentinvisible.org/episode/the-sound-of-sports/, London, England: BBC Radio; (1961), Poetics (Fergusson, F., Trans.).

Using snowball-sampling techniques, a total of 365 women and 247 men completed an online open-ended questionnaire about their reasons for not reporting a concussion. Results indicated that male athletes were more likely to continue to play through and not report a concussion than female athletes. Participants also indicated that they did not report concussions due to (a) perceived lack of resources, (b) perceived lack of severity, (c) conformance to sport cultural norms, which was comprised of two subthemes: adherence to the pain principle and team allegiance. The results suggest that efforts to address concussion management in sport need to focus on the communicative and structural elements that privilege hegemonic masculinity and playing through pain, as they contribute to muting athletes in advocating for their health. © The Author(s) 2015.","Concussions; Gender and sport; Hegemonic masculinity; Muted group theory; Pain principle",,,,,,,,,"Anderson, E., Kian, E.M., Examining media contestation of masculinity and head trauma in the National Football League (2012) Men and Masculinities, 15, pp. 152-173; Ardener, S., (1975) Perceiving Women, , London, England: Malaby Press; Ardener, S., (1978) Defining Females: The Nature of Women in Society, , New York, NY: Halsted; Bagilhole, B., Cross, S., It never struck me as female: Investigating men’s entry into female-dominated occupations (2006) Journal of Gender Studies, 15, pp. 35-48; Bandura, A., (1986) Social Foundations of Thought and Action: A Social Cognitive Theory, , Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice Hall; Beck, C.S., Aubuchon, S.M., McKenna, T.P., Ruhl, S., Simmons, N., Blurring personal health and public priorities: An analysis of celebrity health narratives in the public sphere (2014) Health Communication, 29, pp. 244-256; Bloom, G.A., Loughead, T.M., Shapcott, E.J.B., Johnston, K.M., Delaney, J.S., The prevalence and recovery of concussed male and female collegiate athletes (2008) European Journal of Sport Science, 8, pp. 295-303; Branch, J., (2011) Derek Boogard: A Brain ‘going bad.’, , http://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/06/sports/hockey/derek-boogaard-a-brain-going-bad.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0, December 5; Braun, V., Clarke, V., Using thematic analysis in psychology (2006) Qualitative Research in Psychology, 3, pp. 77-101; Cantu, R., Hyman, M., (2012) Concussions and Our Kids: America’s Leading Expert on How to Protect Young Athletes and Keep Sports Safe, , New York, NY: Houghton Mifflin; Caswell, S.V., Lincoln, A.E., Almquist, J.L., Dunn, R.E., Hinton, R.Y., Video incident analysis of head injuries in high school girls’ lacrosse (2012) The American Journal of Sports Medicine, 40, pp. 756-762; Charlesworth, H., Young, K., Why English female university athletes play with pain: Motivations and rationalisations (2004) Sporting Bodies, Damaged Selves: Sociological Studies of Sports-Related Injuries, pp. 163-180. , In K.

These are products and brands that consumers are devoted and emotionally connected to with disregard for competitors, price change, or controversy. In the world of sport, loyalty beyond reason is common and seemingly required with many fan bases. In addition, athletes of all skill level are loyal to sporting goods and brands. The purpose of this exploratory research was to examine the relationship between Lovemarks and the world of sport. Outcomes of this research aim to assist sport managers and communication specialists in (a) breaking through advertising clutter, (b) recognizing and utilizing fan emotion for good, and (c) segmenting advertising and marketing campaigns into attainable subgroups. Utilizing a content analysis to analyze 668 openended nominations of sport-related products, brands, teams, venues, and people to Lovemarks.com, researchers uncovered themes and top-coded categories of love and respect.

Specifically, the study utilizes a social shaping and construction of technology theoretical framework to investigate and discuss how users of Strava communicatively negotiate what it means to be an ethical user of the technology. Drawing on interviews and participant observations of 47 users of the cycling-focused fitness app, the study presents how users perceive and understand online and off-line actions in terms of ethical conduct. Findings indicate that users view actions as indeterminate or disreputable. While disreputable actions are considered outright cheating, indeterminate actions remain in a gray area that is ethically questionable. The study details how the communicative features of Strava allow users to enact sportsmanship through kudos (e.g., congratulatory comments) and refereeing (e.g., flagging user data). This article concludes by offering examples of how relevant social groups are beginning to shape the sports technology. © The Author(s) 2015.","Communication; Ethics; Recreation; Sportsmanship; Technology",,,,,,,,,"http://www.usantidoping.org/about, USADA; Ahmed, H., Qureshi, O.M., Khan, A.A., Reviving a ghost in the history of technology: The social construction of the recumbent bicycle (2015) Social Studies of Science, 45, pp. 130-136; Arthur-Banning, S., Wells, M.S., Baker, B.L., Hegreness, R., Parents behaving badly?

However, communication research has not addressed the mediated attribution of responsibility for this problem. Drawing on the distinction between episodic and thematic framing, this study analyzes the attribution of responsibility in three quality German national newspapers. We find that responsibility for causing performance enhancing drugs (PEDs) use is equally attributed to the individual and systemic levels, while responsibility for finding solutions is directed at the systemic level. Individual responsibility attributions occur more frequently in articles with an episodic news frame. Given the often proclaimed ambiguous role of the media with regard to PED use, the study attaches particular importance to the self-attribution of responsibility by the media. Our findings show that the media neglect to discuss their own role and do not see themselves as responsible for the problem of doping. This study demonstrates that the investigation of mediated responsibility attribution provides a fruitful new approach to the research on media and PED use in sports. © The Author(s) 2015.","Attribution of responsibility; Causal and treatment responsibility; Content analysis; Doping; Framing",,,,,,,,,"An, S.K., Gower, K.K., How do the news media frame crises?

It considers the theoretical orientations of semiotics and the key analytical foci to which semiotic research pays attention. Initially, this article reviews a linguistic theory of structuralism and poststructuralism. It also contemplates three paired concepts within the semiotic discipline that are particularly relevant to sport communication research. These include (1) the notion of denotation and connotation, (2) metaphoric and metonymic signs, and (3) syntagmatic and paradigmatic relations. This article also considers Derrida’s notions of différance and deconstruction. In addition, this article presents a case study of analysing the content of the Procter and Gamble Company’s marketing communication campaign associated with the Olympics in order to show how the conceptual tools of semiotics can be used for sport and communication studies. This case study indicates that the Olympic sponsor’s commercial messages naturalise the gender order underpinned by the notion of hegemonic masculinity. This work concludes that while semiotics is, by no means, a research tool without limitations, it can be a useful interpretative method for analysing meaning-making processes in sport communication and for identifying underlying ideological assumptions embedded in sport as a cultural text. © The Author(s) 2015.","Deconstruction; Différance; Gender; Ideology; Poststructuralism; Semiotics; Structuralism",,,,,,,,,"Althusser, L., (1971) Lenin and philosophy, and other essays, , London, England: New Left Books; Armstrong, E.G., The commodified 23, or, Michael Jordan as text (1996) Sociology of Sport Journal, 13, pp. 325-343; Barker, C., (2008) Cultural studies: Theory and practice, , (3rd ed.).

A national survey of 490 respondents was conducted at three different time periods (10 weeks before the start of the World Cup, the start of the World Cup, and immediately following Team USA’s first World Cup match) to determine whether planned media consumption of the World Cup shifted based on levels of fan identification and nationalized qualities. Using structural equation modeling, increased nationalized qualities across two of the factors (nationalism and internationalism) increased World Cup fan identification, resulting in predicting higher planned television consumption of this international megasporting event. Nationalized identity alone had no significant result on predicting television consumption of international sport. Ramifications for theory, as well as conclusions related to deciphering the complex formulation of national identity and sports fandom, are offered. © The Author(s) 2015.","Fan identification; Nationalism;

While second screen use during sport programming is on the rise, current understanding of second screen use and engagement is lacking. Thus, in an attempt to extend Niche Theory, the current study employs a structural equation model to further understanding of second screen use. Further, to better understand the outcome of second screen use, the current study examines the relationship between team identification, engagement, and self-efficacy with second screen use. Results suggest that engagement and self-efficacy both have a direct influence on attitude, whereas team identification and self-efficacy have a positive impact on engagement. Each of the hypothesized relationships is tested individually as well as in a theoretically constructed model of engagement and use. © The Author(s) 2015.","Multitasking media; Niche theory; Second screen; Social television; Sports",,,,,,,,,"(2006) Defining Engagement Initiative, , http://mobdev.thearf.com/research-arf-initiatives-defining-engagement, Advertising Research Foundation, Retrieved March 29, 2015, from; Agarwal, R., Sambamurthy, V., Stair, R.M., The evolving relationship between general and specific computer self-efficacy: An empirical assessment (2000) Information Systems Research, 11, pp. 418-430; Aird, T., (2014) TV Strikes Back: Rise of Digital Devices Drives New Viewing Habits, , http://www.tnsglobal.com/press-release/connected-life-tv-pressrelease, Retrieved August 30, 2015, from; Ashforth, B.E., Mael, F., Social identity theory and the organization (1989) Academy of Management Review, 14, pp. 20-39; Bandura, A., (1986) Social Foundations of Thought and Action: A Social Cognitive Theory, , Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice Hall; Bandura, A., (1997) Self-Efficacy: The Exercise of Control, , New York, NY: W.H.

This rise in exposure and accessibility has increased biological knowledge among sport “fans,” a concept I use broadly, and complicated our relationship with sport. Using Rose’s notion of biological citizenship, which draws on Foucault’s concepts of biopolitics and biopower, I introduce “biological fandom” as a way to think about the intensification of bioknowledge in and around sport. As a problem space where various relationships of power intersect, biofandom creates new forms of knowledge, surveillance, and ethical problems. In this article, I sketch the relations of power that create biological fandom. First, I focus on aspects of the media that are concerned with quantifying the bodies of athletes and new biomedical treatments in sports medicine. Second, within this larger media context, I proceed to explore what I see as a particularly concentrated manifestation of biofandom, fantasy sports. Using examples from fantasy sports media, I argue that biological fandom perpetuates neoliberal norms that encourage self-work and individualism among “biofans,” while also fetishizing the individual athlete and creating undifferentiated athletic masses. © The Author(s) 2015.","Biopolitics; Biopower; Fandom; Fantasy sports; Foucault; Sport",,,,,,,,,"Agamben, G., (1998) Homo Sacer: Sovereign Power and Bare Life.

Yet, major gender inequities remain, including in media coverage. Feminist sports media scholars have pointed to journalists’ resistance toward Title IX as one explanation for these inequities. To further examine the relationship between Title IX and coverage of women’s sport, this study draws upon oral history interviews with 14 sports journalists who worked at newspapers in one major media market in the United States before and after the implementation of Title IX. In their memories, journalists incorporated two dominant cultural narratives: conflict narratives, which position gains in women’s sports against losses in men’s sports, and celebratory narratives, which uncritically embrace Title IX as a catalyst for girls and women in sport. Although all agreed that Title IX had a positive impact upon women’s sports, few believed Title IX actually changed coverage. This study points to the limitations of applying Title IX’s gender equity framework to sports journalism and calls for a reassessment in advocacy efforts toward gender justice. © The Author(s) 2015.","Gender equity; Oral history; Sports journalism; Title IX; Women’s sports",,,,,,,,,"(2012) Discovery News, , http://news.discovery.com/adventure/extreme-sports/us-women-olympics-london-120813.htm, August 13, Retrieved from; Abrams, L., (2010) Oral History Theory, , New York, NY: Routledge; Acosta, R.V., Carpenter, L.J., (2014) Women in Intercollegiate Sport: A Longitudinal, National Study, Thirty-Seven Year Update, , http://acostacarpenter.org/, Retrieved from; Anderson, K., Armitage, S., Jack, D., Wittner, J., Beginning where we are: Feminist methodology in oral history (1987) The Oral History Review, 15, pp. 103-127. , http://doi.org/10.2307/3674961; Angelini, J.R., Macarthur, P.J., Billings, A.C., What’s the gendered story?

Considered are how the contours of Communication and Sport as a scholarly project were defined in important ways by an inaugural double issue in 2013 that featured key figures in the development of communication and sport as an articulated and important area of inquiry and have been given further shape by key studies, special issues and research forums published in the journal’s first three years.

This article argues that through Jackie Robinson, Michael Sam mobilizes the political rhetoric of respectability, the notion that inclusion is the meaning of social struggle and that it is achieved in enacting the rhetorical and behavioral norms modeled in straight White men. Respectability works to domesticate the imagery associated with gay sexuality, to figure the citizen as a model of comportment which relies for its appeal on the civil rights movement as queer sexuality’s map through politics. Moreover, Sam’s circulation through public discourse is marked by a carefully managed stage presence, a phenomenon which, I believe, disavows critiques of neoliberal capitalism by attaching Sam’s sexuality to meanings that might generate economic value. Although the allusion to Robinson presupposes a discursive frame in which Sam’s race and sexuality are merely incidental to each other, taking it seriously is worthwhile not only by examining the rhetorical work the comparison performs but also by tugging at the hidden stitches that hold it together. © The Author(s) 2015.","Heteronormativity; Intersectionality; Jackie Robinson; Michael Sam; Neoliberalism; NFL; Respectability politics",,,,,,,,,"(2013), Burbank, CA: Warner Bros.

The process of selecting and screening talents involves not only physical and technical skills but also efforts to find adequate personality traits. Therefore, different types of performance appraisal interviews (PAIs) are becoming increasingly common within the field. Departing from fieldwork in two selection camps for Swedish youth national teams in soccer and hockey, we will take a closer look at the PAIs employed during these camps. This article takes on a narrative approach, emphasizing PAI as a narrative genre and a framework for a specific form of interaction. Our findings show how eligibility is performed in interaction through following three practices: (i) showcasing gratitude without tipping into flattery, (ii) using temporality as a way of displaying developmental potential, and (iii) adopting the role of the self-reflecting subject. This genre of interviews not only produces certain practices but also preferred subject positions and narratives. The PAI is thus a narrative genre where the players are encouraged to perform talent in order to appear selectable. © The Author(s) 2015.","Narrative analysis; Performance appraisal interviews; Positioning; Small stories; Talent selection",,,,,,,,,"Aidman, E.V., Attribute-based selection for success: The role of personality attributes in long-term predictions of achievement in sport (2007) The Journal of the American Board of Sport Psychology, 1, pp. 1-18; Anshell, M.H., Lidor, R., Talent detection programs in sport: The questionable use of psychological measures (2012) Journal of Sport Behavior, 35, pp. 239-267; Asmuß, B., Performance appraisal interviews.

After distributing an online survey using a snowball sampling technique, a total of 133 Chinese sports journalists working in print media participated in this study. The results indicated that news gathering was reported as a primary motivation to use social media. Weibo and WeChat, two localized social networking tools, were the most commonly used tools among participants. Nearly half of participating sports journalists admitted that monitoring information on social media increased their pressure level and created workloads. The majority of sports journalists believed social media had weakened their gatekeeping role due to the increase in citizen journalists and the increase in channels and sources from which users obtain news and information. The study also found that the relationship between journalists and athletes has also been altered with the advent of social media. © The Author(s) 2015.","Chinese sports journalists; Gatekeeping; Journalist–athlete relationship; Social media; WeChat; Weibo",,,,,,,,,"(2014), http://en.theorychina.org/chinatoday_2483/whitebooks/201504/t20150407_321169.shtml, Chinese journalism development report; Ballouli, K., Hutchinson, M., Digital branding and social media strategies for professional athletes, sports teams and leagues: An interview with digital Roylty’s Amy Martin (2010) International Journal of Sport Communication, 3, pp. 394-401; Barboza, D., A popular Chinese social networking app blazes its own path (2014) New York Times, , http://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/21/technology/achinese-social-network-blazes-its-own-path.html, January 21; Bei, J., (2013) How Chinese Journalists Use Weibo Microblogging for Investigative Reporting, , https://reutersinstitute.politics.ox.ac.uk/sites/default/files/How_Chinese_journalists_use_Weibo_microblogging_for_investigative_reporting(1).pdf, Reuters Institute Fellowship Paper; Bowman, N.D., Cranmer, G.A., SocialMediaSport: The fan as a (mediated) participant in spectator sports (2014) Routledge Handbook of Sport and New Media, pp. 213-224. , In A.

This article examines an Australian advertisement for the 2015 Cricket World Cup, which features as its main protagonists female cricket fans supporting a variety of countries. It makes use of a transnational feminist cultural studies paradigm to frame a discussion of how commercial sports media narratives situate these fans as ‘‘ordinary.’’ In considering how the multicultural female sports fan is configured as ordinary in the Australian sporting context, I demonstrate the ways in which narratives of gender and nation are mobilized to situate multicultural women as marginal to both the Australian nation and cricket, despite the prominence given to ethnically diverse women in the advertisement. This manoeuvre, I argue, responds to the cultural and economic transformations of cricket globally, simultaneously denying and universalizing difference as a mechanism to assuage the anxieties generated by the decentering of Western power in international cricket. © The Author(s) 2015.","Cricket; Fandom; Gender; Multiculturalism; Representation",,,,,,,,,"Bairner, A., (2001) Sport, Nationalism, and Globalization, , Albany, NY: SUNY; Baker, S.A., Rowe, D., Mediating mega events and manufacturing multiculturalism: The cultural politics of the world game in Australia (2014) Journal of Sociology, 50, pp. 299-314; Bale, J., Cronin, M., (2003) Sport and Postcolonialism, , (Eds.), Oxford, New York: Berg; Biscomb, K., Griggs, G., A splendid effort!’ Print media reporting of England’s women’s performance in the 2009 Cricket World Cup (2012) International Review for the Sociology of Sport, 48, pp. 99-111; Bruce, T., Communication and sport: Reflections on women and femininities (2013) Communication and Sport, 1, pp. 125-137; Cashman, R., Asia’s place in the imaging of Australian sport (2009) Sport in Society, 12, pp. 933-946; Cooky, C., Messner, M., Hextrum, R., Women play sport, but not on TV: A longitudinal study of televised sport media (2013) Communication and Sport, 1, pp. 203-230; Crabbe, T., Wagg, S., A carnival of cricket?’: The cricket world cup, ‘race’ and the politics of carnival (2000) Culture, Sport, Society, 3, pp. 70-88; Crawford, G., (2004) Consuming Sport.

I do this through an examination of a set of Internet memes that juxtapose the bodies of National Hockey League players with National Basketball Association players in one single image. I argue these memes celebrate White masculinity, while at the same time constructing African American athletes as individualistic, selfish, and unwilling to sacrifice their bodies for the greater good of the team. More so, I argue that these memes construct a form of racial ideology that is representative of White backlash politics. © The Author(s) 2015.","Communication; Hockey; Internet memes; Masculinity; Race",,,,,,,,,"Abdel-Shehid, G., (2005) Who da man?

When audiotapes were released with Los Angeles Clippers owner Donald Sterling making racist comments, fans and players threatened to boycott playoff games. Within 4 days, the new NBA Commissioner Adam Silver banned Sterling for life. While Silver was lauded for his decision, coverage ignored the underlying structural issues that uphold inequality in the NBA. This article reviews recent communication and sport scholarship examining race and the NBA. By examining Silver’s decision using Kenneth Burke’s Terms of Order (1961), this article argues that the NBA continues to ignore how racism operates in the league. © The Author(s) 2015.","Black masculinity; Donald sterling; NBA; Power; Scapegoating",,,,,,,"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: The author received a research grant from the University of Wisconsin-La Crosse, College of Liberal Arts.",,"Adler, L., NBA players react to the lifetime ban of clippers owner Donald Sterling (2014) Buzzfeed, , http://www.buzzfeed.com/lindseyadler/nba-playersreact-to-the-lifetime-ban-of-clippers-owner-dona#.rew1OoQ3d, April 29, Retrieved from; Andrews, D.L., (2001) Michael Jordan, Inc.: Corporate sport, media culture, and late modern America, , Albany, NY: State University of New York Press; Andrews, D.L., Silk, M.L., Basketball’s Ghettocentric logic (2010) American Behavioral Scientist, 53, pp. 1626-1644; Angelini, J.R., Billings, A.C., An agenda that sets the frames: Gender, language, and NBC’s Americanized Olympic telecast (2010) Journal of Language and Social Psychology, 29, pp. 363-385; Badenhausen, K., Donald Sterling proves once again that he is the worst owner in sports (2014) Forbes, , http://www.forbes.com/sites/kurtbadenhausen/2014/04/26/donald-sterling-proves-once-again-why-he-is-the-worst-owner-in-sports/, April 26, Retrieved from; Bernstein, B., (2014) The NBA on ESPN, , April 27, Television Broadcast, Bristol, CT: ESPN Networks; Billings, A.C., (2008) Olympic media: Inside the biggest show on television, , New York, NY: Routledge; Billings, A., Power in the reverberation: Why Twitter matters, but not the way most believe (2014) Communication & Sport, 2, pp. 107-112; Billings, A.C., Halone, K.K., Denham, B.E., “Man, that was a pretty shot:"" An analysis of gendered broadcast commentary surrounding the 2000 Men’s and Women’s NCAA Final Four Basketball Championships (2002) Mass Communication & Society, 5, pp. 295-315; Bloom, H., Donald Sterling remains real winner in Clippers sale (2014) Sporting News, , http://www.sportingnews.com/nba/story/2014-08-12/donald-sterling-clippers-sale-lawsuit-nba-adam-silver-shelly-sterling, August 12, Retrieved from; Bonilla-Silva, E., The linguistics of color blind racism: How to talk nasty about Blacks without sounding “Racist.” (2002) Critical Sociology, 28, pp. 41-64; Boren, C., NBA players were “ready to boycott” games if NBA hadn’t acted against Donald Sterling (2014) Washington Post, , http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/early-lead/wp/2014/04/29/nba-players-were-ready-to-boycott-games-if-nbahadnt-acted-against-donald-sterling/, April 30, Retrieved from; Brummett, B., Symbolic form, Burkean scapegoating, and rhetorical exigency in Alioto’s response to the “Zebra” murders (1980) TheWestern Journal of Speech Communication, 44, pp. 64-73; Burke, K., (1961) The rhetoric of religion, , Boston, MA: Beacon Press; Butterworth, M.L., Purifying the body politic: Steroids, Rafael Palmeiro, and the rhetorical cleansing of Major League Baseball (2008) Western Journal of Communication, 72, pp. 145-161; Carlson, A.C., “You know it when you see it:"" The rhetorical hierarchy of race and gender in Rhinelander v.

The analysis first explains how “Ball don’t lie” counters what can be called “basketball common sense” by analyzing the official language of the NBA concerning fouls, referees, and disputes over foul calls, which it is argued functions as an authoritarian speech act that obscures its own nature. In view of this, it is argued that “Ball don’t lie!"" counters with a pragmatic intervention in a material and discursive contest between a player and a referee. It is shown how this intervention serves to situate and contextualize the racial politics of basketball in American society. Through this analysis, a sketch of a history of race in the NBA may be seen that focuses on what may be called the “the White basketball unconscious,” and the analysis aims to illuminate how “Ball don’t lie” intervenes as a disruptive form of political affirmation, one that, metonymically, resonates beyond the court and into American society more broadly. © The Author(s) 2015.","Basketball; Philosophy; Politics; Pragmatism; Race",,,,,,,,,"Anderson, L., Millman, C., (1999) Pickup artists: Street basketball in America, , London, England: Verso; Andrews, D.L., The facts(s) of Michael Jordan’s blackness: Excavating a floating racial signifier (2001) Michael Jordan, Inc.: Corporate Sport, media culture and late modern America, pp. 107-152. , D.

This article illustrates the relationship between internal communication (peer communication, coach-player communication, communication training, and internal public relation [PR] practices) and commitment of individual players in the sports, broadening the understanding of internal communication practices in sport organizations. This study hypothesized a positive relationship between internal communication dimensions and sport commitment through survey methodology. Using multivariate regression technique, the hypotheses were tested on a sample of 223 players from National Cricket Academy of India that has produced some of the best cricketers in the world. Positive relationships between peer, coach-player communication, communication training, and internal PR practices of the organization and predicting individual sport commitment of players. Stronger predictions were observed for communication training and internal PR practices as compared to peer communication and coach-player communication. The study provides valuable insights from the player’s perspective on internal communication process in a sports organization to ensure individual sport commitment.

Consequently, it is important that communication scholars attend to this topic. This research explored print media framing in response to two injury situations involving National Football League quarterbacks-Jay Cutler and Robert Griffin III. An analysis of 177 newspaper articles revealed 11 frames that were used to discuss these injuries. The most prominent frame for Cutler was support while shifting the blame was most prominent for Griffin. The results suggest that sports journalists framing of injuries could potentially be a catalyst to shift football cultural norms towards valuing players who put their health first.

Examining the autobiographies of 14 German and English soccer players, we investigate how athletes use media outlets, what they perceive as the media’s influence and its logic, and-crucially-how this usage and these perceptions affect their own media-related behavior. Our findings demonstrate the important role of the media for the sports systems from the athlete’s point of view and demonstrate the research potential of mediatization as a fruitful concept in studies on sport communication. On the one hand, the sport stars reflect in their autobiographies that their status and income depend on media coverage; and on the other hand, they complain about the omnipresence of the media, especially offside the pitch and feel unfairly treated by the tabloid press, both in England and in Germany. © The Author(s) 2015.","Autobiographies; Mediatization; Qualitative content analysis; Soccer; Sports and media",,,,,,,,,"Altheide, D.L., Media logic, social control, and fear (2013) Communication Theory, 23, pp. 223-235; Altheide, D.L., Snow, R.P., (1979) Media logic, , Beverly Hills, CA: Sage; Bajramaj, L., (2009) Mein Tor ins Leben.

Box 6293, Morgantown, WV  26506, United States","Previous research suggests athletes’ leader-member exchanges (LMX) with coaches are associated with subsequent communication and relationships with coaches and teammates, as athletes with in-group relationships experience more prosocial outcomes than athletes without these relationships. Thus, the formation of in-group relationships is desirable, but extant literature has provided little insight into how coaches can foster these relationships. This study addressed this gap in literature by examining contextual and relational factors (i.e., coach enacted social support) as predictors of athletes’ perceptions of LMX with head coaches. A sample of 216 former high school athletes produced results that indicate both contextual factors and coach-enacted social support can be used to predict athletes’ perceptions of LMX-with starting status, emotional support, and esteem support being uniquely predictive. Overall, the model utilized in this study accounted for 65% of athletes’ perceptions with coach enacted social support accounting for 52% of these perceptions. The practical and theoretical implications are discussed within this article. © The Author(s) 2014.","Athlete-coach relationships; Coaching; Leader-member exchange; Social support; Sport communication",,,,,,,,,"Abgarov, A., Fraser-Thomas, J., Baker, J., Jeffery-Tosoni, S., Understanding social support throughout the injury process among interuniversity swimmers (2012) Journal of Intercollegiate Sport, 5, pp. 213-239;

This study demonstrates two viewer characteristics that impact attention to information graphics in two excerpts from the 2012 World Series. Eye-tracking data reveal that although viewers universally attend to these graphics upon onset, those with greater interest in sports and sports statistics exhibited greater cognitive processing of these elements as indexed by gaze duration. Differences in selective attention provide a framework for studying attention in new sport media high in visual complexity. © The Author(s) 2014.","Attention; Eye tracking; Fanship; Information graphics; Television",,,,,,,"The final hypothesis (H3) proposed that viewers with greatest knowledge of fantasy sport and sport statistics would allocate more attention to information graphics. To test this hypothesis, participant assignment to the two levels of knowledge served as the grouping variable. Again, gaze duration and fixation frequency served as dependent variables. The analysis found a difference between the groups, F(1, 53) = 5.28, p = .02, Zp2 = .10. Those with the greatest knowledge of fantasy sport and sport statistics spent significantly longer time looking at on-screen graphics compared to those with less interest. This effect was not dependent upon a specific AOI, as the test found no interaction between the grouping variable and the AOI, F(1, 53) = 1.50, p = .22. Although this difference was not manifested when examining the fixation frequency data, the test approached statistical significance, F(1, 53) = 3.62, p = .06, Z2 = .06.

Actual evidence for a change in consumption patterns, though, remains scarce. This study investigates college students’ use of multiple distribution systems in the context of sports. More specifically, the relative importance of Twitter in relation to television is assessed. In addition, variables potentially predicting a greater reliance on Twitter are analyzed. Results indicate that television remains the primary distribution system for sports and that the importance of Twitter might have been overstated. The use of social media does not diminish the consumption of traditional sports broadcasts but is positively correlated. Finally, results of a regression analysis find that a subset of individuals is more likely to rely on Twitter depending on their tendency to engage in parasocial interactions, their Twitter use patterns, and their perceived expertise in sports. © The Author(s) 2015.","Parasocial interaction; Social media; Sport; Television; Twitter",,,,,,,,,"Abelman, R., Can we generalize from generation X?

Study progression followed three phases beginning with a qualitative analysis of sport social media consumers. The second phase examined responses collected through online surveys made available through social networking sites. The results suggest that social media uses in sport fluctuate along two separate but related dimensions: high and low activity and interactivity. During the final phase, exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was employed to determine elements that lead to the development of these dimensions. Based on the EFA results and established dimensions, social media uses fall categorically into four distinct domains: cooperation community, competition community, proactive community, and passive community. This study makes a significant contribution to the literature by empirically validating a framework upon which social media consumption can more accurately be measured. © The Author(s) 2014.","Media uses; Multidimensional scaling; Social media; Sport communication; Typology",,,,,,,,,"Anandarajan, M., Devine, P., Simmers, C.A., A multidimensional scaling approach to personal web usage in the workplace (2004) Personal web usage in the workplace: A guide to effective human resources management, pp. 61-79. , M.

More specifically, high school, collegiate (i.e., National Collegiate Athletic Association), and professional (i.e., National Football League) football fans (N = 698) were asked to respond to items that have been associated with six POA in previous studies, as well as items that tested a new point of attachment to conference/ division of a fan’s favorite team. A confirmatory factor analysis indicated that this revised seven-factor, 21-item points of attachment index demonstrated adequate overall fit. Our findings also indicated that multiple POA differed significantly among high school, collegiate, and professional football fans.

This is exemplified by the English Football Association (FA), which has been criticized for its ineffective responses to addressing the inclusion and progression of women as players and workers within the organization. Female membership in male-dominated organizations is not readily achieved, given the dominance of masculinist discourses and the risks of overtly challenging these. In this study, we explored the discursive management of gendered and/or footballing identities from interviews with participants in an English regional FA’s women-only football coach education program. All of the participants described the peripheral positioning of women in English football. Analysis identified evidence of both collaboration with and resistance to the dominant masculinist discourses in the accounts of their experiences in football, while also reproducing the most valued footballing identities and knowledge as male. We connect this to the complexities of negotiating and managing gendered identities for women in male-dominated organizations. All of the participants described the value and benefits of women-only coach education and the majority noted they would prefer women-only coach education in future. © The Author(s) 2015.","Coach training; Football/soccer; Gendered discourses; Identities; Sport organizations",,,,,,,,,"Cameron, D., Performing gender identity: Young men’s talk and the construction of heterosexual masculinity (1997) Language and masculinity, pp. 47-64. , S.

As sports blogs grow in popularity, it is important to understand their role in facilitating fan communication about important social issues like race. This article examines how sporting ideologies interact with the unique context of interactive blogging spaces to influence fan discourse about race, ethnicity, and sport. By examining blog content and fan discussions on seven interactive baseball blogs, I show that social expectations of sports blogs typically discouraged racial discourse, thus upholding the racial status quo. When discussions about race occurred, they proceeded differently depending on the blogging environment. Fans were hostile when discussing race in blogging environments that didn’t encourage social solidarity. If blogging environments were structured to generate community solidarity, fans were more likely to politely dismiss race or to joke about the topic, though they did show some potential for substantial, meaningful conversations about race. This research underscores the importance of understanding how unique interactive contexts of new media spaces and broader cultural meanings work together to shape fan communication about sport. © The Author(s) 2015.","Baseball; Blogs; Racial discourse; Solidarity; Sports fans",,,,,,"Temple University, TU","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This research was supported in part by a Doctoral Dissertation Completion Grant from Temple University.",,"Bargh, J.A., McKenna, K.Y.A., The internet and social life (2004) Annual Review of Psychology, 55, pp. 573-590; Bernstein, A., Blain, N., (2003) Sport, media, culture, , Portland, OR: Frank Cass Publishers; Billings, A.C., Talking around race: Stereotypes, media, and the twenty-first century collegiate athlete (2012) Wake Forest Journal of Law & Policy, 2, p. 199; Bonilla-Silva, E., (2006) Racism without racists: Color-blind racism and the persistence of racial inequality in the United States, , New York, NY: Rowman & Littlefield; Boyle, R., Haynes, R., New media sport (2003) Sport, media, culture, pp. 95-114. , A.

This article performed a demographic analysis of television viewership within Australia’s two largest football codes, the Australian Football League and the National Rugby League, to explore the demographics of this audience more closely. This was coupled with an advertising content analysis of corresponding football telecasts to consider the degree of synchronicity between audience and advertising. The article concludes both codes have an older, male-orientated audience skew. However, given that approximately 40% of the audience is female, both codes can lay claim to a more even-gender share of viewership than might be expected, given the highly masculine and physical nature of both sports. Notably, in-game advertising largely reflects its audience, with the majority of the advertisers selling products that appeal to both men and women. Commercial breaks within the broadcasts of both codes were also found to be strongly concentrated towards a small number of leading advertisers. © The Author(s) 2014.","Advertising; Football; Sports broadcast rights; Strategy; Television",,,,,,,,,"Adams, A., Anderson, E., McCormack, M., Establishing and challenging masculinity: The influence of gendered discourses in organized sport (2010) Journal of Language and Social Psychology, 29, pp. 278-300; Angelini, J., Television sports and athlete sex: Looking at the differences in watching male and female athletes (2008) Journal of Broadcasting & Electronic Media, 52, pp. 16-32; (2010) Spectator attendance at sporting events, 2009-10, , Canberra, Australia: ABS; (2012) Participation in sport and physical activity, 2011-12, , Canberra, Australia: ABS; Baimbridge, M., Cameron, S., Dawson, P., Satellite broadcasting and match attendance: The case of rugby league (1995) Applied Economic Letters, 2, pp. 343-346; Balnaves, M., O’Reagan, T., The politics and practice of television conventions: Australian and American approaches to broadcast ratings (2010) Continuum: Journal of Media & Cultural Studies, 24, pp. 461-474; Barnett, S., (1990) Games and sets: The changing face of sport on television, , London, UK: BFI; Bryson, L., Sport and the maintenance of masculine hegemony (1987) Women’s Studies International Forum, 15, pp. 349-360; Buraimo, B., Stadium attendance and television audience demand in English League Football (2008) Managerial and Decision Economics, 29, pp. 513-523; Cashman, R., (2010) Paradise of sport: The rise of organised sport in Australia, , Sydney: Walla Walla Press; Clark, J., Apostolopoulou, A., Gladden, J., Real women watch football: Gender differences in the consumption of the NFL Super Bowl broadcast (2009) Journal of Promotion Management, 15, pp. 165-183; Connell, R., (1995) Masculinities, , Cambridge, England: Polity Press; Cooper, R., Tang, T., Gender predictors of multiplatform media ssers: A case study of the Super Bowl (2013) International Journal of Sport Communication, 6, pp. 348-363; Davies, C., Sternberg, J., The spaces and places of audience research in Australian Television (2007) Media International Australia, Incorporating Culture & Policy, 122, pp. 28-42; Dietz-Uhler, B., Harrick, E., End, C., Jacquemotte, L., Sex difference in sport fan behavior and reasons for being a sport fan (2000) Journal of Sport Behavior, 23, pp. 219-231; Donnelly, W., (1995) Planning media: Strategy and imagination, , Upper Saddle River, NJ: Prentice Hall; Forrest, D., Simmons, R., Buraimo, B., Outcome uncertainty and the couch potato audience (2005) Scottish Journal of Political Economy, 52, pp. 641-661; Fortunato, J., (2001) The ultimate assist: The relationship and broadcast strategies of the NBA and television networks, , Cresskill, NJ: Hampton Press; Fujak, H., (2012) An analysis of broadcasting and attendance in the Australian football industry, , Master of Arts by Research in Sport Studies, Sydney, Australia: University of Technology Sydney; Fujak, H., Frawley, S., The Barassi line: Quantifying Australia great sporting divide (2013) Sporting Traditions, 30, pp. 93-110; Gantz, W., Wang, Z., Paul, B., Potter, R., Sports versus all comers: Comparing television sports fans of other programming genres (2006) Journal of Broadcasting & Electronic Media, 50, pp. 95-118; Gantz, W., Wenner, L., Men, women, and sports: Audience experiences and effects (1991) Journal of Broadcasting & Electronic Media, 35, pp. 233-243; Gratton, C., Solberg, H.A., (2007) The economics of sports broadcasting, , London, England: Routledge; Hess, R., ‘Ladies are specially invited’: Women in the culture of Australian rules football (2007) The International Journal of the History of Sport, 17, pp. 111-141; Hoehn, T., Lancefield, D., Broadcasting and sport (2003) Oxford Review of Economic Policy, 19, pp. 552-568; Howard, D., Crompton, J., (1995) Financing sport, , Morgantown, WV: Fitness Information Technology; Jakee, K., Kenneally, M., Mitchell, H., Asymmetries in scheduling slots and gameday revenues: An example from the Australian Football League (2010) Sport Management Review, 13, pp. 50-64; Katz, H., (2003) The media handbook, , Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum; Krippendorff, K., Validity in content analysis (1980) Computerstrategien für die Kommunikationsanalyse, pp. 69-112. , E.

As a by-product, the potential exists for variances in television coverage between clubs that may result in significant economic disparity. This article endeavours to quantify this variance and discuss the related management implications of findings by analysing television ratings for a sample of 2,297 Australian Football League and National Rugby League fixtures played between 2007 and 2011. The article concludes that there is significant variance in the coverage provided and corresponding cumulative audience exposure of clubs within both leagues that was likely to impact sponsorship desirability and ability to engage fans. Notably, there was distinct favouritism shown towards those traditionally perceived as “powerhouse” clubs. The degree to which free-to-air broadcasts and finals matches deliver superior audience outcomes to subscription-only telecasts and regular season matches was also quantified. © The Author(s) 2014.","Australian football league; Broadcast strategy; League scheduling; National rugby league; Television ratings",,,,,,,,,"Ang, I., (2006) Desperately seeking the audience, , London, England: Routledge; (2014) 2013 annual report, , Melbourne, Australia: Australian Football League; (2007) AFL broadcast agreement, , Sydney, Australia: Austar; Barkhuus, L., Brown, B., Unpacking the television: User practices around a changing technology (2009) ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction, 16, pp. 1-22; Borland, J., MacDonald, R., Demand for sport (2003) Oxford Review of Economic Policy, 19, pp. 478-502; (2011) Annual report, , Brisbane, Australia: Brisbane Broncos Rugby League Club; Bryman, A., (2008) Qualitative research, , London, England: Sage; Cashman, R., (2010) Paradise of sport: The rise of organised sport in Australia, , Sydney, Australia: Walla Walla Press; (2011) Annual report, , Sydney, Australia: Author; (2011) Annual financial report 2011, , Melbourne, Australia: Collingwood Football Club; Field, A., (2013) Discovering statistics using IBM SPSS statistics, , London, England: Sage; Fortunato, J., (2001) The ultimate assist: The relationship and broadcast strategies of the NBA and television networks, , Cresskill, NJ: Hampton Press; Foster, G., (2006) The business of sports, , New York, NY: Thomson; Fujak, H., (2012) An analysis of broadcasting and attendance in the Australian football industry, , UnpublishedMaster of Sport Studies Thesis, University of Technology, Sydney, Australia; Fujak, H., Frawley, S., The Barassi Line: Quantifying Australia’s great sporting divide (2013) Sporting Traditions, 30, pp. 93-109; Fujak, H., Frawley, S., The relationship between television viewership and advertising content in Australian football broadcasts (2016) Communication and Sport, 4, pp. 82-101; Gantz, W., Wenner, L.A., Men, women, and sports: Audience experiences and effects (1991) Journal of Broadcasting & Electronic Media, 35, pp. 233-243; Gantz, W., Wenner, L.A., Carrico, C., Knorr, M., Assessing the football widow hypothesis: A coorientation study of the role of televised sports in long-standing relationships (1995) Journal of Sport & Social Issues, 19, pp. 352-376; Gitlin, T., (1985) Inside prime time, , New York, NY: Random House Incorporated; Jakee, K., Kenneally, M., Mitchell, H., Asymmetries in scheduling slots and game-day revenues: An example from the Australian football league (2010) Sports Management Review, 13, pp. 50-64; Kelly, L., Whiteman, C., Sport sponsorship as an IMC tool: An Australian sponsor’s perspective (2010) Journal of Sponsorship, 4, pp. 26-37; Lynch, R., Frawley, S., Sport (2013) Australian leisure, , 5th ed., Sydney, Australia: Pearson; Miller, T., (2010) Television studies: The basics, , London, England: Routledge; Montgomery, D., (2013) Design and analysis of experiments, , 8th ed., Hoboken, NJ: John Wiley; (2014) 2013 annual report, , Sydney, Australia: Author; (2011) Annual report, , Newcastle, Australia: Author; Nicholson, M., (2007) Sport and the Media: Managing the Nexus, , Oxford, MA: Routledge; Noll, R.G., Broadcasting and team sports (2007) Scottish Journal of Political Economy, 54, pp. 400-421; (2011) Annual report, , Melbourne, Australia: Author; (2010) Changes to the television landscape, , Sydney, Australia: Author; (2010) OzTam ratings report, , Sydney, Australia: Author; Rowe, D., (1999) Sport, culture and the media; The unruly trinity, , Philadelphia, PA: Open University; Rowe, D., Gilmour, C., (2009) Getting a ticket to the world party: Televising soccer in Australia.

The approach to this is an analytical focus on a wide range of sports, which are examined from an institutional and organizational approach to mediatization theory. On the basis of an empirical study of governing sports organizations (national sports federations), it is demonstrated that digital media are a major concern across organizations and that a new wave of mediatization is taking place in sports. Still, many organizations struggle with this and currently find themselves in a state of flux, trying to involve employees, volunteers, and external partners with communication competencies in their activities in various ways, on many levels, and for many varying purposes. Consequently, one of the significant effects of digital media is a dispersion of communication involving more people and concurrent increase in internal complexity in many organizations. Mediatization is therefore a process that is very much in operation at many levels and at various speeds, but it also takes organizations in diverse directions. Using Thornton and Ocasio’s interinstitutional approach and concept of institutional logics, it is argued and demonstrated that this is because these sports organizations have other relevant and powerful institutional partners or organizations that need to be considered in the process as well. © The Author(s) 2015.","Digital media; Institutional logics; Mediatization; Sports organizations",,,,,,,"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: The research is a part of the research program ‘‘Mediatization of Culture - The Challenge of New Media’’ 2011-2015, that has been funded by the Danish Research Council.",,"Billings, A.C., (2011) Sports media.

As suggested by a neoinstitutionalist, understanding of organizational relationships, routines, and professional expectations become accepted over time by journalists and sports organizations alike. However, new competition from online media, as well as new opportunities for teams to bypass the media, have threatened the legitimacy of journalists and their work practices. A survey of 437 reporters and communications personnel found key differences in the ways those in the professions perceived access, suggesting that traditional work patterns are evolving in ways that could delegitimate journalists inside and outside sports. © The Author(s) 2015.","College sports; Neoinstitutionalism; Sport communications; Sport media; Sports journalism",,,,,,,,,"Anderson, W.B., Does the cheerleading ever stop?

This presents a ripe context for the proliferation of new communication technologies and creative practices, a phenomenon that has yet to receive systematic scholarly treatment. By tracing the contours of one ray from the Olympic hypermedia spectrum, the #NBCFail movement during the Sochi 2014 Winter Olympics, this article argues that the evolution and proliferation of the media and the voices telling the Olympic story has resulted in an extension and renegotiation of the Olympic narrative through various acts of global communicative creativity.

Researchers have examined the link between sports media exposure and the negative effect on body perceptions of young girls and women, though a gap exists in the examination of the relationship between media images and positive impact. Grounded in the theories of self-objectification and social comparison, this study tested the relationships between self-objectification and body esteem and sports media exposure. Using a between-participants experimental design, this study examined how three different images of elite female athletes-performance, glamorized, and overly sexualized-impacted collegiate-level female athlete’s tendency to self-objectify and their levels of body esteem. Results suggest that less self-objectification occurs and greater body satisfaction is achieved when images of performance athletes are viewed, suggesting a need for more of these images in mainstream media. © The Author(s) 2015.","Media; Self-objectification; Social comparison; Sports",,,,,,,,,"Acosta, R.V., Carpenter, L.J., (2012) Women in intercollegiate sport: A longitudinal, national study: Thirty-five year update, 1977-2012, , http://www.acostacarpenter.org, New York, NY: Brooklyn College, Retrieved from; Angelini, J.R., Television sports and athlete sex: Looking at the differences in watching male and female athletes (2008) Journal of Broadcasting & Electronic Media, 52, pp. 16-32; Angelini, J.R., MacArthur, P.J., Billings, A.C., What’s the gendered story?

While her record making swims made her comeback an athletic success, the importance of her comeback extends beyond her athletic accomplishments. Media representations of Torres during her comeback construct her body and the lifestyle that produced it as inspirational-or fitspirational. Although the term circulates widely in U.S. popular culture, and despite its importance in reframing what a woman’s ideal body is and how it is achieved, fitspiration has not received much attention from scholars. In this article, we use the constructed narrative of Torres’s 2008 comeback to demonstrate how notions of individualism, self-monitoring practices, personal responsibility, and empowerment in conjunction with long-standing ideological portrayals of women athletes erase social inequalities and perpetuate heteronormative ideals. The constructed narrative produces her as a fitspirational figure whom American women should emulate. Furthermore, this process transforms Torres from an elite athlete to a mom who used sport to regain her fitness. Her status as an elite athlete is marginalized and her body becomes attainable through the representation of her age and motherhood as barriers that can be overcome through self-monitored consumptive practices. © The Author(s) 2015.","Comeback; Fitspiration; Motherhood; Swimming; Women",,,,,,,,,"Adams, M.L., No taste for rough-and-tumble play: Sport discourses, the DSM, and the regulation of effeminacy (2013) GLQ: A Journal of Lesbian and Gay Studies, 19, pp. 515-543; Anderson, K., The mother of all comebacks (2008) Sports Illustrated, 109 (2), pp. 62-65. , July 14; Anderson, K., One for the aged (2008) Sports Illustrated, 109 (7), pp. 74-76. , August 25; Appleby, K.M., Fisher, L.A., (2004) Running in and out of pregnancy: Elite distance runners’ experiences of returning to competition after pregnancy, , Doctoral dissertation, University of Texas, Knoxville; Billings, A.C., Angelini, J.R., Holt Duke, A., Gendered profiles of Olympic history: Sportscaster dialogue in the 2008 Beijing Olympics (2010) Journal of Broadcasting & Electronic Media, 54, pp. 9-23; Birrell, S., McDonald, M., (2000) Reading sport: Critical essays on power and representation, , Boston, MA: Northeastern University Press; Birrell, S., Theberge, N., Ideological control of women in sport (1994) Women and sport: Interdisciplinary perspectives, pp. 341-359. , D.

We examine one particularly interesting case: The innovative social media marketing practices of the Los Angeles Kings hockey organization, most especially through its twitter account @LAKings. Through the use of digital ethnography, we analyze and interpret official statements produced within the context of the Kings marketing and consumer strategies. We argue that the Los Angeles Kings’ social media strategy illustrates the potential collaborative efforts of an organization and its consumers in a social media space. This “coexistence” between brand and consumer provides the organization an opportunity to encourage relationship development and brand community. © The Author(s) 2014.","Consumer behavior; Relationship marketing; Social media; Strategic marketing; Twitter",,,,,,,,,"Atkinson, P., Hammersley, M., Ethnography and participant observation (1998) Strategies of qualitative inquiry, pp. 110-136. , N.

This study, a 5-year update to a 25-year longitudinal study, indicates that the quantity of coverage of women’s sports in televised sports news and highlights shows remains dismally low. Even more so than in past iterations of this study, the lion’s share of coverage is given to the ‘‘big three’’ of men’s pro and college football, basketball, and baseball. The study reveals some qualitative changes over time, including a decline in the once-common tendency to present women as sexualized objects of humor replaced by a tendency to view women athletes in their roles as mothers. The analysis highlights a stark contrast between the exciting, amplified delivery of stories about men’s sports, and the often dull, matter-of-fact delivery of women’s sports stories.

These types of games propel the consumer into a newfound intertextual ‘‘reality.’’ It is here that feelings of identification are played out and where pseudosocial relationships begin to develop. This article charts such relationships, as they are explicated online in the form of online blogs. Through analysing the content of Championship Manager/Football Manager blogs, data show how game players speak frequently of pseudosocial relationships, characterised in this case study by emotions of loyalty and friendship. Many have nostalgic tales from past achievements and bonds with individual players that bridge the many iterations of the game over the past 15 years.

It is noted that this special issue features a wide range of concerns and approaches, from reframing the agenda for the communication of sport and disability, to how understandings of environmental communication help contextualize debates over building athletic facilities and sports stadia, to the dynamics of whistle-blowing amid communication about breaches in ethics in athletic settings, to how discourse about events such as the ‘‘Tough Mudder’’ can be better understood through a Foucauldian lens on ideology and capitalism, and how leader–member exchange theory can help better understand communication between coaches and athletes in the sport setting. © The Author(s) 2014.","Communication studies; Disability and sport; Environmental impact; Foucault; Leader-member exchange theory; Sport; Whistle-blowers",,,,,,,,,,"Butterworth, M.L.; Ohio University, 102A Lasher Hall, United States; email: butterwm@ohio.edu",,,"SAGE Publications Ltd",,,,,21674795,,,,"English","Commun.

The @London2012 account served as the news outlet, while tweets containing #London2012 served as the unit of analysis to determine whether agenda setting was present. A content analysis of these tweets revealed significant differences between the two groups in terms of tweet focus, sports mentioned, and countries mentioned, suggesting no agenda setting presence on Twitter. Additionally, the primary affiliation of individuals utilizing #London2012 was laypeople, which aligned with previous Twitter-specific research.

This time frame represented a turbulent period in his career, as he faced a doping investigation by the U.S. government and later admitted to using performance-enhancing drugs during a nationally televised interview with Oprah Winfrey. Armstrong’s 859 tweets during this time period and his comments during the Oprah Winfrey interview were collected and subjected to a thematic analysis using Benoit’s image repair typology. Results indicated that via Twitter, Armstrong used attacking the accuser, bolstering, and stonewalling strategies but during the interview demonstrated contrition by employing mortification, shifting blame, simple denial, provocation, and victimization along with two newly identified strategies: conforming and retrospective regret. The results suggest that athletes who display multifaceted image repair strategies can embolden identification and attachment with followers and introduce competing media narratives surrounding their identity. However, these strategies may backfire when divergent messages are delivered in different media forums. Theoretical and practical implications will be discussed. © The Author(s) 2013.","Identity; Image repair; Lance Armstrong; Social media; Twitter",,,,,,,,,"USADA, , http://www.usantidoping.org/about; Albergotti, R., Armstrong lawsuit dismissed (2012) Wall Street Journal, , http://online.wsj.com/article/SB1000872396390444443504577601373048501222.html, August 20; Austen, I., (2012) Inquiry on Lance Armstrong Ends with No Charges, , http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/04/sports/cycling/federal-prose-cutors-drop-lance-armstrong-investigation.html, New York Times; Benoit, W.L., (1995) Accounts, Excuses, and Apologies: A Theory of Image Restoration Strategies, , Albany, NY: State University of New York Press; Benoit, W.L., Image repair discourse and crisis communication (1997) Public Relations Review, 23, pp. 177-186; Benoit, W.L., Another visit to the theory of image restoration strategies (2000) Communication Quarterly, 44, pp. 463-477; Benoit, W.L., President Bush’s image repair effort on Meet the Press: The complexities of defeasibility (2006) Journal of Applied Communication Research, 34, pp. 285-306; Benoit, W.L., NPR’s image repair discourse on firing Juan Williams (2011) Journal of Radio and Audio Media, 18, pp. 84-91; Benoit, W.L., Hanczor, R.S., The Tonya Harding controversy: An analysis of image restoration strategies (1994) Communication Quarterly, 42, pp. 416-433; Brazeal, L.M., The image repair strategies of Terrell Owens (2008) Public Relations Review, 34, pp. 145-150; Fisher, E., Flight of fancy?

Although it can result in both adverse and beneficial outcomes, little is known about the nature of this uncertainty. Thus, framed by Uncertainty Management Theory (UMT), this study relied on in-depth interviews of 17 student-athletes at an athletically-and-academically elite U.S. university to uncover what uncertainty scholar-athletes encountered and how they managed this ambiguity communicatively. The investigation found student-athletes experienced personal (e.g., injury), social (e.g., friends), and future (e.g., career) uncertainty. Participants managed this uncertainty through the use of communication strategies such as seeking social support, not disclosing their athlete status, or relying on prayer. While most participants perceived uncertainty as negative and sought to reduce it, some embraced it and learned to adapt. In addition to uncovering tangible uncertainty management strategies, the study recommends that college athletics departments implement several measures to address uncertainty. © The Author(s) 2014.","College student-athletes; Division I; Interviews; Thematic analysis; Uncertainty management",,,,,,,,,"Anshel, M.H., Wells, B., Sources of acute stress and coping styles in competitive sport (2000) Anxiety, Stress & Coping: An International Journal, 13, pp. 1-26; Baxter, L.A., Montgomery, B.M., (1996) Relating: Dialogues and Dialectics, , New York, NY: Guilford Press; Beamon, K.K., ‘Used goods’’: Former African American college student-athletes’ perception of exploitation (2008) The Journal of Negro Education, 77, pp. 352-364; Benford, R.D., The college sports reform movement: Reframing the ‘‘edutainment’’ industry (2007) The Sociological Quarterly, 48, pp. 1-28; Berger, C.R., Calabrese, R.J., Some explorations in initial interaction and beyond: Toward a developmental theory of interpersonal communication (1975) Human Communication Research, 1, pp. 99-112; Brashers, D.E., Communication and uncertainty management (2001) Journal of Communication, 51, pp. 477-497. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/joc/51.3.477; Brashers, D.E., A theory of communication and uncertainty management (2006) Explaining Communication: Contemporary Theories and Exemplars, pp. 223-242. , B.

In particular, it focuses on the National Hockey League’s ‘‘Inside the Warrior’’ advertising campaign created by marketing agency Conductor (for the relaunch of the League after the 2004–2005 lockout), that was, in part, envisioned for and marketed to target female audience. Using insights revealed through in-depth semistructured interviews with two cultural intermediaries, the critical analysis in this article focuses on how the cultural intermediaries from Conductor imagined and conceptualised female hockey fans as a target audience, engages in a comparative analysis between the creative strategies in the production of the ‘‘Inside the Warrior’’ campaign and characteristics of female narratives to attract a female audience, and discusses the accommodation of resistance to the stereotypical representations of gender in the ‘‘Inside the Warrior’’ campaign by the cultural intermediaries. These insights serve to highlight the hegemonic position of cultural intermediaries and the disjuncture between the encoding by producers and the interpretation by consumers and fans. © The Author(s) 2013.","Cultural intermediaries; Gender; Ice hockey; Media; Spectatorship",,,,,,,,,"Adams, N.G., Bettis, P.J., (2003) Cheerleader!

The moment features complementary and competing scholarly journals, a notable advance in institutional formations in scholarly organizations that have helped legitimize inquiry in the area, and the strategic rise of academic programs, institutes, and centers in communication and media studies that focus on sport. In assessing the state of scholarly play on communication and sport, competing questions are considered: (1) ‘‘Is there ‘a’ field and, if so, what is it? and/or (2) ‘‘Are there many ‘fields of play’ with offset objectives, priorities, and levels of develop-ment?’’ An epistemological assessment is made of three dispositions to the study of communication and sport: (1) a ‘‘Media, Sports, and Society’’ disposition, (2) a ‘‘Sport Communication as Profession’’ disposition, and (3) a ‘‘Communication Studies and Sport’’ disposition. The essay closes with summary characterization of these dispositions and points to the challenges ahead for the scholarly study of communication and sport to develop as a coherent field. © The Author(s) 2015.","Communication and sport; Epistemology; Media and sport; Scholarly agenda; Sport communication",,,,,,,,,"Giddens, A., (1984) The Constitution of Society: Outline of the Theory of Structuration., , Cambridge, England: Polity; Hall, S., Encoding and decoding in the television discourse (1973) Birmingham, , England: Centre for the Study of Contemporary Cultural Studies; Kassing, J.W., Billings, A.C., Brown, R.S., Halone, K.K., Harrison, K., Krizek, B., Meân, L., Turman, P.D., Communication in the community of sport: The process of enacting, (re)producing, consuming, and organizing sport (2004) Communication Yearbook, 28, pp. 373-410; McPhee, J., (1965) A Sense of Where You Are, , New York, NY: Farrar, Straus, & Giroux; Real, M.R., Super bowl: Mythic spectacle (1975) Journal of Communication, 25, pp. 31-43; Wenner, L.A., (1989) Media, Sports, and Society, , Newbury Park, CA: Sage; Wenner, L.A., (1998) Playing the Mediasport Game, pp. 3-13. , L.

Athletic programs at a number of high-profile universities have been sanctioned by the National Collegiate Athletic Association in the past decade. When athletic departments participate in corrupt behavior, the possibility of whistle-blowing exists. Although organizational scholars have developed theoretical models describing whistle-blowing processes, it is unclear whether these models accurately depict whistle-blower’s experiences in the collegiate sports industry. Thus, the purpose of the present study was to generate a model describing the experiences of whistle-blowers operating in the intercollegiate sports industry. Thirteen whistle-blowers were interviewed for this study; analysis of case studies revealed that whistle-blowing occurred over five stages and was significantly affected by the collegiate athletics context. Of particular consequence was the hypermasculine, highly competitive collegiate sports environment. © The Author(s) 2014.","Dissent; NCAA; Reform; Retaliation; Whistle-blowing",,,,,,,,,"Acker, J., Hierarchies, jobs, bodies: A theory of gendered organizations (1990) Gender & Society, 4, pp. 139-158; Adcroft, A., Teckman, J., Taking sport seriously (2009) Management Decision, 47, pp. 5-13; Alford, C.F., Whistle-blower narratives: The experience of choiceless choice (2007) Social Research, 74, pp. 223-248; Allain, K.A., ‘Real fast and tough’’: The construction of Canadian hockey masculinity (2008) Sociology of Sport Journal, 25, pp. 462-481; Arthur, S., Nazroo, J.Y., Designing fieldwork strategies and materials (2003) Qualitative Research Practice: a Guide for Social Science Students and Researchers, pp. 109-137. , J.

This study analyzes how U.S. mass media contextualized Lin’s meteoric rise in the NBA and explores assumptions grounded in the media coverage of Lin, including how race and masculinity are defined within a dominant ideological field and how notions of a hegemonic masculinity define the ‘‘other.’’ This article looks at mass media as a site of complicity for the construction and maintenance of hegemonic masculinity by examining media representations and sports media columnists’ coverage of Jeremy Lin’s meteoric rise in the NBA from February 5 to March 15, 2012. Critical discourse analysis reveals that the majority of mainstream news media outlets did not overtly racialize Lin’s meteoric rise to stardom. However, the research uncovered several instances of racialized coverage and the incorporation of emasculation discourse to reinforce and police hegemonic notions of masculinity. Furthermore, the intense ‘‘media mania’’ referred to as ‘‘Linsanity’’ operated to preserve the dominant discourse of masculinity by confirming the ‘‘low expectations’’ inscribed in Asian male bodies, making Lin’s success ‘‘miraculous’’ and ‘‘warranting’’ intense media attention. © The Author(s) 2014.","Asian American; Hegemony; Masculinity; Mass media; Race",,,,,,,,,"http://www.aaja.org/media-advisory-on-jeremy-lin-news-coverage/, 2012, February 23; Beck, H., Linsanity has left the building (2012) The New York Times, , http://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/16/sports/basketball/for-the-knicks-linsanity-has-left-the-building.html?_r¼2&; Billings, A.C., Angelini, J.R., Eastman, S.T., Wie shock: Television commentary about playing on the PGA and LPGA tours (2008) The Howard Journal of Communications, 19, pp. 64-84; Boren, C., Jeremy Lin: Ben & Jerry apologizes for its ‘Taste of Lin-sanity’ flavor (2012) Washington Post, , http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/early-lead/post/jeremy-lin-ben-and-jerrys-apologizes-for-its-taste-of-linsanity-flavor/2012/02/28/gIQARpU8fR_blog.html, February 28, Retrieved from; Boren, C., Floyd Mayweather Jr. Talks Jeremy Lin tweets, Manny Pacquiao fight (2012) Washington Post, , http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/early-lead/post/floyd-mayweather-jr-talks-jeremy-lin-tweets-manny-pacquiao-fight/2012/02/29/gIQAXgWLiR_blog.html, b, February 29; Bowen, F., (2012) Jeremy Lin, an Unlikely Basketball Star, , http://articles.washingtonpost.com/2012-02-15/lifestyle/35443324_1_jer-emy-lin-new-york-knicks-team-nba, The Washington Post; Burns, P., Bristolmetrics: Sportscenter Said ‘‘Lin’’ More Often that ‘‘if’’ Or ‘‘but’’ Last Week, , http://deadspin.com/5886442/bristolmetrics-sportscenter-said-lin-more-often-than-if-or-but-last-week, 2012, February 20; Burstyn, V., (1999) The Rites of Men: Manhood, Politics, and the Culture of Sport, , Toronto: University of Toronto Press; Carrington, B., Sport, masculinity, and Black cultural resistance (1998) Journal of Sport and Social Issues, 22, pp. 275-298; Chan, J.W., Bruce Lee’s fictional models of masculinity (2000) Men and Masculinities, 2, pp. 371-387; Chen, A., Lives at the center of the periphery, lives at the periphery of the center: Chinese American masculinities and bargaining with hegemony (1999) Gender & Society, 13, pp. 584-607; Cheng, A., We choose not to compete: The ‘‘merit’’ discourse in the selection process, and Asian and Asian American men and their masculinity (1996) Masculinities in Organizations, pp. 177-200. , C.

Using the theoretical notions of framing and hegemony, this study used a thematic analysis to analyze the discourse surrounding Pistorius’s competitions. Using the National Broadcasting Company’s (NBC) broadcasts of the Olympics and Paralympics, as well as the Channel 4 broadcast of the Paralympics, several prominent themes emerged from the analysis. NBC’s broadcasts featured stereotypical portrayals of disabled athletes, including the notion of the ‘‘supercrip,’’ while Channel 4’s broadcast heralded Pistorius for being a legend and sided with Pistorius when controversy erupted after a race. The differences in the broadcast commentaries as well as theoretical implications are discussed. © The Author(s) 2014.","Disability sport; Hegemony; Oscar pistorius; Paralympics; Thematic analysis",,,,,,,,,"Berger, R.J., Disability and the dedicated wheelchair athlete: Beyond the ‘‘supercrip’’ critique (2008) Journal of Contemporary Ethnography, 37, pp. 647-678; Billings, A.C., Angelini, J., Packaging the games for viewer consumption: Gender, ethnicity, and nationality in NBC’s coverage of the 2004 summer Olympics (2007) Communication Quarterly, 55, pp. 95-111; Billings, A.C., Angelini, J., Duke, A.H., Gendered profiles of Olympic history: Sportscaster dialogue in the 2008 Beijing Olympics (2010) Journal of Broadcasting & Electronic Media, 54, pp. 9-23; Billings, A.C., Angelini, J.R., Macarthur, P.J., Bissell, K., Reichart Smith, L., (Re)calling London: The gender frame agenda within NBC’s primetime broadcast of the 2012 Olympiad (2014) Journalism & Mass Communication Quarterly, 9, pp. 38-58; Buysse, J.M., Borcherding, B., Framing gender and disability: A cross-cultural analysis of photographs from the 2008 Paralympic games (2010) International Journal of Sport Communication, 3, pp. 308-321; Carrigan, T., Connell, B., Lee, J., Toward a new sociology of masculinity (1985) Theory & Society, 14, pp. 551-604; Chowdhury, S., (2012) Paralympics 2012: Oscar Pistorius Beaten by Alan Oliveira in 200M.

Encouraging users to ‘‘pin’’ and comment on content featuring sports-related activities, athletes, and merchandise, Pinterest presents an opportunity for sports organizations looking to connect and build communities with fans. This study employed the relationship-marketing conceptual framework (Grönroos, 2004) to examine how four North American professional sports leagues used Pinterest over a 1-year time period to communicate as well as encourage engagement and interaction with fans. The longitudinal content analysis and chi-square analyses of 24,156 pins revealed the sports teams used Pinterest to promote the fan group experience, provide team and game information, and sell team-related merchandise.

Results reveal that female athletes are covered photographically in unprecedented ways from mainstream media on espnW, both in frequency and in seriousness of coverage as measured by athletes in uniform, on the playing surface, and in action. Additionally, feature articles portray female athletes as serious competitors by highlighting athletic performance and psychological/emo-tional strengths instead of focusing on athletes’ physical appearance, family roles, or personal relationships. Although some depictions mirror past representations, where female athletes are represented more than male athletes in individual sports and more at the recreational level of sport, these factors pale in comparison to the number of factors that showcase female athletes as serious competitors. © The Author(s) 2013.","Espn, Inc.; Espnw; Female athletes; Sports; Sportswomen",,,,,,,,,"2012 Hot 100: The Definitive List of The world’s Most Beautiful Women, , www.maxim.com/hot-100/2012; Badenhausen, K., (2013) Maria Sharapova Tops List of the world’s Highest-Paid Female Athletes, , http://www.forbes.com/sites/kurtbadenhausen/2013/08/05/maria-sharapova-tops-list-of-the-worlds-highest-paid-female-athletes/; Ballouli, K., Hutchinson, M., (2010) Digital-Branding and Social-Media Strategies for Professional Athletes, Sports Teams, and Leagues: An Interview with Digital Royalty’s Amy Martin; Billings, A.C., Halone, K.K., Denham, B.E., ‘Man, that was a pretty shot’’: An analysis of gendered broadcast commentary surrounding the 2000 men’s and women’s NCAA Final Four basketball championships (2002) Mass Communication & Society, 5, pp. 295-315; Black, T.R., (1999) Doing Quantitative Research in the Social Sciences: An Integrated Approach to Research Design, Measurement and Statistics, , Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage; Brooten, L., Representations of women (2009) Battleground, 2, pp. 459-469. , R.

Media-focused scholarship has identified different ways that sport articulates, perpetuates, and can challenge ableist views of disabled bodies. This article explores sites for additional communication research building on work on disability and sport from outside the communication and media studies field. The scholarship on disability and sport is explored around three themes: disability sport and rehabilitation discourse; disability metaphors and stereotypes; and sport, public controversy, and disability law. Possibilities for communication-focused work around each of these themes are also explored, and a case is made for the continued emphasis on integration of feminist, queer, and critical race theory into the study of discourse around disability and sport. © The Author(s) 2013.","Ableism; Disability; Disability sport; Discrimination; Supercrip",,,,,,,,,"Asch, A., Critical race theory, feminism, and disability: Reflections on social justice and personal identity (2001) Ohio State Law Journal, 62, pp. 391-425; Ashton-Shaeffer, C., Gibson, H.J., Autry, C.E., Hanson, C.S., Meaning of sport to adults with physical disabilities: A disability sport camp experience (2001) Sociology of Sport Journal, 18, pp. 95-114; Berger, R.J., Disability and the dedicated wheelchair athlete: Beyond the ‘supercrip’ critique (2008) Journal of Contemporary Ethnography, 37, pp. 647-678; Billings, A.C., Eastman, S.T., Gender, ethnicity, and nationality: Formation of identity in NBC’s 2000 Olympic coverage (2002) International Review for the Sociology of Sport, 37, pp. 349-368; Billings, A.C., Eastman, S.T., Framing identities: Gender, ethnic, and national parity in network announcing of the 2002 Winter Olympics (2003) Journal of Communication, 53, pp. 369-386; Blauwet, C., Willick, S.E., The Paralympic movement: Using sports to promote health, disability rights, and social integration for athletes with disabilities (2012) PM&R, 4, pp. 851-856; Brittain, I., Perceptions of disability and their impact upon involvement in sport for people with disabilities at all levels (2004) Journal of Sport and Social Issues, 28, pp. 429-452; Bush, A., Silk, M., Porter, J., Howe, P.D., Disability [sport] and discourse: Stories within the Paralympic legacy (2013) Reflective Practice: International and Multidisciplinary Perspectives, 14, pp. 632-647; Butterworth, M.L., Pitchers and catchers: Mike Piazza and the discourse of gay identity in the national pastime (2006) Journal of Sport and Social Issues, 30, pp. 138-157; Butterworth, M.L., ‘Katie was not only a girl, she was terrible’’: Katie Hnida, body rhetoric, and football at the University of Colorado (2008) Communication Studies, 59, pp. 259-273; Campbell, F.A.K., Exploring internalized ableism using critical race theory (2008) Disability & Society, 23, pp. 151-162; Cherney, J.L., Sport, disability, and public controversy: Ableist rhetoric and Casey Martin v.

Previously unreported information about these individuals, including their behavior on and off the field, is now massively disseminated to the public for consumption. Although the extensive amount of media coverage often focuses on the athletes’ in-game performances, other information related to their individual characteristics and personal lives can be featured as well. Sports journalists can and do employ various frames that emphasize specific content in their stories; but the influence these frames have on subsequent audience evaluations pertaining to the athletes featured within them is unknown. This study will explore several important factors in the attitude formation process, including features of the media coverage itself, characteristics of the featured athletes, and characteristics of the processing audience. Implications for content producers in the media industry and directions for future research are discussed. © The Author(s) 2013.","Attitudes; Enjoyment; Framing; Media; Sports",,,,,,,,,"Andersen, S.M., Klatzky, R.L., Traits and social stereotypes: Levels of categorization in person perception (1987) Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 53, pp. 235-246; Carlston, D.E., Skowronski, J.J., Linking versus thinking: Evidence for the different associative and attributional bases of spontaneous trait transference and spontaneous trait inference (2005) Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 89, pp. 884-898; Carrington, B., McDonald, I., (2009) Marxism, Cultural Studies and Sport: Mapping the Field, , New York, NY: Routledge; Cook, S.W., Borman, P.D., Moore, M.A., Kunkel, M.A., College students’ perceptions of spiritual people and religious people (2000) Journal of Psychology and Theology, 28, pp. 125-137; Denham, B.E., Toward an explication of media enjoyment: The synergy of social norms, viewing situations, and program content (2004) Communication Theory, 14 (4), pp. 370-387; Eagly, A.H., Chaiken, S., The advantages of an inclusive definition of attitude (2007) Social Cognition, 25, pp. 582-602; Eastman, S.T., Land, A.M., The best of both worlds: Sports fans find good seats at the bar (1997) Journal of Sport & Social Issues, 21, pp. 156-178; Fazio, R.H., Multiple processes by which attitudes guide behavior: The MODE model as an integrative framework (1990) Advances in Experimental Social Psychology, 23, pp. 75-109. , M.P.

In the intercollegiate sports world, environmental efforts are undertaken as part of a strategic effort involving collaborative processes across university units. The purpose of this study is to develop a more comprehensive and detailed understanding of collaborative processes and practices between personnel in athletics departments and sustainability offices at universities and colleges in the United States. In-depth interviews were conducted with athletics and sustainability department personnel at colleges and universities in the United States. A total of 13 schools were included in the study with 17 participants agreeing to be interviewed. All interviewees were from the middle management level and higher in their respective organizations. Five central themes related to these relationships were found: relationship development, relationship communication, relationship decision-making development, collaborative efforts, and relationship challenges. The themes raise important issues about the diversity of relationships, the communicative and decision-making processes, and the involvement of stakeholders in environmental efforts as well as future research in this area. © The Author(s) 2013.","Collaboration; Environment; Intercollegiate; Sustainability",,,,,,,,,"Ajzen, I., The theory of planned behavior (1991) Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Making Processes, 50, pp. 179-211; (2013) Signatories List, , http://www.presidentsclimatecommitment.org/signatories/list; Amey, M., Leading partnerships: Competencies for collaboration (2010) New Directions for Community Colleges, (149), pp. 13-23; Anderson, R., Baxter, L., Cissna, K., (2004) Dialogue: Theorizing Difference in Communication Studies, , Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage; Austrom, D., Lad, L., Problem solving networks towards a synthesis of innovative approaches (1986) Academy of Management Best Papers Proceedings, pp. 311-314. , J.

Previous findings suggest sports fans will act on behalf of an organization during a crisis. Yet, the tweets of Penn State fans showed that they turned on the university and placed their loyalty with Coach Joe Paterno. Furthermore, this study discovered that fans engaged in the ingratiation, reminder, and scapegoat strategies most befitting the typology offered by Coombs, empowering the active stakeholders in the process. Results of this case provide a warning for organizations that online fan-based crisis response may not always be enacted in their best interests. © The Author(s) 2013.","Crisis communication; Public relations; Social media; Sports communication",,,,,,,,,"Avery, E., Lariscy, R., Kim, S., Hocke, T., A quantitative review of crisis communication research in public relations from 1991 to 2009 (2010) Public Relations Review, 36, pp. 190-192; Benoit, W.L., (1995) Accounts, Excuses, and Apologies: A Theory of Image Restoration Discourse, , Albany, NY: SUNY Press; Benoit, W.L., Image repair discourse and crisis communication (1997) Public Relations Review, 23, pp. 177-180; Benoit, W.L., (2007) Communication in Political Campaigns, , New York, NY: Peter Lang; Benoit, W., Hanczor, R., The Tonya Harding controversy: An analysis of image restoration strategies (1994) Communication Quarterly, 42, pp. 416-433; Benson, J.A., Crisis revisited: An analysis of the strategies used by Tylenol in the second tampering episode (1988) Central States Speech Journal, 39, pp. 49-66; Billings, A.C., Butterworth, M.L., Turman, P.D., (2011) Communication and Sport: Surveying the Field, , Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage; Brown, K.A., Dickhaus, J., Long, M.C., LeBron James and ‘‘The Decision:’’ An empirical examination of image repair in sports (2012) Journal of Sports Media, 7, pp. 149-175; Brown, N., Billings, A.C., Sports fans as crisis communicators on social media web sites (2013) Public Relations Review, 39, pp. 74-81; Burns, J., Brunner, M., Revisiting the theory of image restoration strategies (2000) Communication Quarterly, 48, pp. 27-39; (2011) A Timeline of the Penn State Child Sex Abuse Scandal, , http://articles.cnn.com/2011-11-16/justice/justice:pennsylvania-coach-abuse-timeline_1_grand-jury-report-business-gary-schultz-young-boy?_s=PM:JUSTICE, November 16, CNN; Coombs, W.T., (2007) Ongoing Crisis Communication: Planning, Managing, and Responding, , Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage; Coombs, W.T., Protecting organization reputations during a crisis: The development and application of situational crisis communication theory (2007) Corporate Reputation Review, 10, pp. 163-176; Coombs, W.T., (2012) Ongoing Crisis Communication: Planning, Managing, and Responding, , 2nd ed.).

This article uses a case study approach to examine the public relations (PR) and communications activities that followed in the fallout from the advert’s broadcast. It shows how the sport organisation’s approach to PR can be characterised by a symbolic interaction approach to PR, developed post hoc, and concerned with creating a favourable impression of the organisation through the manipulation of messaging and argues that this method had questionable ameliorative impact. It further argues that for a niche sport, a more appropriate approach to PR is found in a relationship management approach to PR and communications, as this approach embeds PR at a strategic level and is an effective method for organisations seeking to take strategic control of the communications about their sport. The adoption of strategic relationship management principles to PR offers opportunities to engender a more sophisticated public understanding of disability in sport, increase its popularity, and ensure that elite athletes with a disability are able to attract sponsors and vital funds. © The Author(s) 2014.","Advertising; Case study; Disability; Football; Public relations",,,,,,,,,"(2010) ASA Adjudication on Paddy Power Plc.

We explore how Tough Mudder, as part of a larger matrix of power relations, provides a site that allows participants to gain rhetorical proof of their ‘‘fitness’’ within that world. Furthermore, our purpose is to demonstrate how the logic of neoliberal capitalism is reflected within Tough Mudder challenges that culminate in an embodied performance of discipline toward that logic. We also argue that these challenges act as ‘‘functional sites’’ that are specifically produced and mobilized for the training of individuals’ minds and bodies to align them with the values of a dominant political and economic order. © The Author(s) 2014.","Body rhetoric; Conspicuous; Consumption; Functional sites; Neoliberalism; Social darwinism; Sports and capitalism; Tough mudder",,,,,,,,,"(2011) Conference Papers International Communication Association, pp. 1-49. , Boston, MA: TBA; Andrews, D., Silk, M.L., Sport and neoliberal conjecture (2012) Sport and Neoliberalism: Politics, Consumption, and Culture, pp. 1-19. , D.

The Paralympic mascot, Mandeville, and the Olympic mascot, Wenlock, are similar in appearance and construction. However, their adventures, established through online movies, highlight striking differences between the mascots and the athletes they represent. As mascots portray physical representations of the ideologies of sporting teams and events, producing two mascots for two different sets of athletic competition creates a unique situation through which to compare normative constructions. Through the online-mediated representations of Mandeville and Wenlock, the present study used rhetorical analysis to examine how the two mascots’ stories communicated specific messages to viewers about ability and disability. Within these films, those deemed as disabled are clearly otherized through injury, isolation, and displays of ability. The lens through which viewers learned about able-bodiedness and disability present a stereotypical representation of the body at best, but through the animated stories told about the two mascots, viewers’ perceptions about disabled athletes being injured, being feminine, or being incapable of managing specific tasks may have developed or been reinforced. © The Author(s) 2013.","Disability; Mascots; Olympics; Rhetoric; Sport",,,,,,,,,"Bennett, N., Interview: London 2012 olympic mascots’ creator discusses their design (2010) Digital Arts, , ttp://www.digitalartsonline.co.uk/news/illustration/inter-view-london-2012-olympic-mascots-creator-discusses-their-design/; Brittain, I., Perceptions of disability and their impact upon involvement in sport for with disabilities at all levels (2004) Journal of Sport and Social Issues, 28, pp. 429-452; Chin-Ju, H., Brittain, I., Negotiating identities through disability sport (2006) Sociology of Sport Journal, 23, pp. 352-375; Corrigan, T.F., Paton, J., Holt, E., Hardin, M., Discourses of the ‘‘too abled’’: Contested body hierarchies and the oscar pistorius case (2010) International Journal of Sport Communication, 3, pp. 288-307; Craven, P., The paralympic movement at the dawn of a new era (2002) Raising the Bar: New Horizons in Disablity Sport, pp. 6-7. , A.

The current study utilizes leader–member exchange theory as theoretical lens to examine the influence that athlete–coach communication has on relationships and communication with coaches and teammates. A sample of 158 former high school athletes produced results that indicate that athletes with in-group relationships with coaches report more satisfaction and symmetrical communication with coaches, and more task cohesion, social cohesion, and cooperative communication with teammates. These results highlight the importance of athlete–coach communication for influencing perceptions of relationships and communication with coaches and teammates. © The Author(s) 2014.","Cohesion; Communication symmetry; Cooperative communication; Leader-member exchange theory; Sports communication",,,,,,,,,"Anderson, L.R., Tolson, J., Leaders’ upward influence in the organization: Replication and extensions of the Pelz effect to include group-support and self-monitoring (1991) Small Group Research, 22, pp. 59-75; Bakar, H.A., Dilbeck, K.E., McCroskey, K.C., Mediating role of supervisory communication practices on relations between leader-member exchange and perceived employee commitment to workgroup (2010) Communication Monographs, 77, pp. 637-656; Billings, A.C., Butterworth, M.L., Turman, P.D., (2012) Communication and Sport: Surveying the Field, , Los Angeles, CA: Sage; Bird, A.M., Team structure and success as related to cohesiveness and leadership (1977) Journal of Social Psychology, 10, pp. 217-233; Bollen, K.A., Hoyle, R.H., Perceived cohesion: A conceptual and empirical examination (1990) Social Forces, 69, pp. 479-504; Carron, A.V., Cohesiveness in sport groups: Interpretations and considerations (1982) Journal of Sport Psychology, 12, pp. 376-387; Carron, A.V., Bray, S.R., Eys, M.A., Team cohesion and team success in sport (2002) Journal of Sports Sciences, 20, pp. 119-126; Carron, A.V., Chelladurai, P., The dynamics of group cohesion in sport (1981) Journal of Sport Psychology, 3, pp. 123-139; Cartwright, D., The nature of group cohesiveness (1968) Group Dynamics: Research and Theory, pp. 91-109. , D.
