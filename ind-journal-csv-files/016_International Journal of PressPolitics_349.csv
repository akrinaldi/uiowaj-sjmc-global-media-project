Coinciding with Facebook’s diffusion in Myanmar is a sharp increase in violence toward minority groups—especially the Rohingya. A U.N. Fact-Finding mission found Facebook was used to spread hate and facilitate the persecution of the Rohingya. But we know little about how people in Myanmar actually use Facebook, how they acquire and evaluate the information they find on the platform and whether they see disinformation or extreme speech. Furthermore, we lack information about the sentiments that Facebook users and non-users express about the Rohingya and how they view Facebook’s role in inter-ethnic conflict. We use interviews to address these questions. We find that people in Myanmar use Facebook for a variety of reasons, that they look at international and domestic sources, and encounter many different kinds of information—including extreme speech—on the platform. Most people also told us that they prefer sources that confirm their views. © The Author(s) 2020.","disinformation; ethnic conflict; extreme speech; Facebook; Myanmar; selective exposure",,,,,,"University of Massachusetts, UMASS","We would like to thank the generous reviewers, the participants in the Social Science Research Council?s workshop on Digital Threats to Democracy, and Catie Bailard for their time and constructive feedback.

American studies suggests ideological asymmetry in attitudes toward fact-checking, as well as greater acceptance of the practice among those more interested in and knowledgeable about politics. We examine attitudes toward fact-checking across six European counties to put these findings in a broader context (N = 6,067). We find greater familiarity with and acceptance of fact-checking in Northern Europe (Sweden and Germany) than elsewhere (Italy, Spain, France, and Poland). We further find two dimensions of political antipathy: a left–right dimension and an “anti-elite” dimension (including dissatisfaction with democracy and negative feelings toward the European Union), the latter of which more consistently predicts negative feelings toward fact-checkers in the countries examined. Our findings demonstrate that despite general acceptance of the movement, significant political divides remain. Those less likely to trust fact-checkers could be more vulnerable to disinformation targeting these divides, leading to a spiral of cynicism. © The Author(s) 2020.","media audiences; media bias; party identity; political perceptions; public opinion",,,,,,"H2020 European Research Council, ERC;CEI;CER;ERBN: 682785",,,,"Amazeen, M.A., Journalistic Interventions: The Structural Factors Aﬀecting the Global Emergence of Fact-Checking (2017) Journalism, 21, pp. 95-111; Amazeen, M.A., Practitioner Perceptions: Critical Junctures and the Global Emergence and Challenges of Fact-Checking (2019) International Communication Gazette, 81, pp. 541-561; Bastos, M., Farkas, J., (2019), Donald Trump Is My President!

We set these contributions against the backdrop of a profound change in how scholars think about the implications of digital media for democracy. From the utopianism that prevailed from the 1990s until the early 2010s, the post-2016 reckoning has led to a change in the kinds of questions scholars ask, with the focus gradually shifting to investigations of the threats, rather than the benefits, of the Internet. The eight contributions presented in this special issue employ a variety of disciplinary approaches and methods, often comparing different countries, to address some of the most pressing questions on how the Internet can hinder the feasibility and well-functioning of democracy around the world. We conclude by setting out three challenges for future research on digital media and politics: a growing but still partial understanding of the extent and impact of the main digital threats to democracy; the risk that the dominant approaches become overly pessimistic, or founded on weak normative grounds; and the risk that research overemphasizes direct and short-term implications of digital threats on individuals and specific groups at the expense of indirect and medium-term effects on collective norms and expectations of behavior. © The Author(s) 2020.","comparative research; democracy; digital media; disinformation; participation",,,,,,,,,,"Achen, C.H., Bartels, L.M., (2017) Democracy for Realists: Why Elections Do not Produce Responsive Government, 4. , Princeton, Princeton University Press; Bailard, C.S., (2014) Democracy’s Double-Edged Sword: How Internet Use Changes Citizens’ Views of Their Government, , Baltimore, Johns Hopkins University Press; Baran, P., On Distributed Communications Network (1962) RAND Corporation, , https://www.rand.org/pubs/papers/P2626.html; Barlow, J.P., (1996) A Declaration of the Independence of Cyberspace, , https://www.eff.org/cyberspace-independence; Barlow, J.P., (2000) The Debate over Internet Governance: A Snapshot in the Year 2000, , https://cyber.harvard.edu/is99/governance/barlow.html; Benkler, Y., (2006) The Wealth of Networks: How Social Production Transforms Markets and Freedom, , New Haven, Yale University Press; Benkler, Y., Faris, R., Roberts, H., (2018) Network Propaganda: Manipulation, Disinformation, and Radicalization in American Politics, , Oxford, Oxford University Press; Bennett, W.L., Pfetsch, B., Rethinking Political Communication in a Time of Disrupted Public Spheres (2018) Journal of Communication, 68 (2). , (,): 243–53; Bennett, W.L., Segerberg, A., (2013) The Logic of Connective Action: Digital Media and the Personalization of Contentious Politics, , Cambridge, Cambridge University Press; Bimber, B., (2003) Information and American Democracy: Technology in the Evolution of Political Power, , Cambridge, Cambridge University Press; Bimber, B., Davis, R., (2003) Campaigning Online: The Internet in US Elections, , Oxford, Oxford University Press; Bimber, B., Gil de Zúñiga, H., The unedited public sphere (2020) New Media & Society, 22. , 700–15; Blumler, J.G., Coleman, S., (2009) The Internet and Democratic Citizenship: Theory, Practice and Policy, , Cambridge, Cambridge University Press; Boatright, R.G., Shaffer, T.J., Sobieraj, S., Young, D.G., (2019) A Crisis of Civility?

Governments have responded with a wide range of policies. However, there is little clarity in elite policy debates or academic literature about what it actually means for disinformation to endanger democracy, and how different policies might protect it. This article proposes that policies to address disinformation seek to defend three important normative goods of democratic systems: self-determination, accountable representation, and public deliberation. Policy responses to protect these goods tend to fall in three corresponding governance sectors: self-determination is the focus of international and national security policies; accountable representation is addressed through electoral regulation; and threats to the quality of public debate and deliberation are countered by media regulation. The article also reveals some of the challenges and risks in these policy sectors, which can be seen in both innovative and failed policy designs. © The Author(s) 2020.","democracy; election campaign; Internet; media law; online disinformation; policy making",,,,,,"Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada, SSHRC","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: Support for this research was provided by the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada.",,,"Allcott, H., Gentzkow, M., Social Media and Fake News in the 2016 Election (2017) Journal of Economic Perspectives, 31 (2). , (,): 211–36; Allcott, H., Gentzkow, M., Yu, C., Trends in the Diffusion of Misinformation on Social Media (2019) Research & Politics, 6, pp. 1-8; (2018) Regulating Social Media: We Need a New Model that Protects Free Expression, , https://www.article19.org/resources/regulating-social-media-need-new-model-protects-free-expression/, London, UK: ARTICLE 19; Aspinwall, N., Taiwan’s War on Fake News Is Hitting the Wrong Targets (2020) Foreign Policy, , https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/01/10/taiwan-election-tsai-disinformation-china-war-fake-news-hitting-wrong-targets/, January, 10; (2019) Digital Platforms Inquiry—Final Report, , https://www.accc.gov.au/publications/digital-platforms-inquiry-final-report, Canberra, Australia, Australian Competition and Consumer Commission; Benkler, Y., Faris, R., Roberts, H., (2018) Network Propaganda: Manipulation, Disinformation, and Radicalization in American Politics, , Oxford, Oxford University Press; Brüggemann, M., Engesser, S., Büchel, F., Humprecht, E., Castro, L., Hallin and Mancini Revisited: Four Empirical Types of Western Media Systems (2014) Journal of Communication, 64 (6). , (,): 1037–65; Cederberg, G., (2018) Catching Swedish Phish: How Sweden Is Protecting Its 2018 Elections, , https://www.belfercenter.org/sites/default/files/files/publication/Swedish%20Phish%20-%20final2.pdf, Cambridge, Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs, Harvard Kennedy School; Chaykowski, K., Facebook Says Fake Accounts Likely Tied to Russia Bought $100,000 in Political Ads (2017) Forbes, , https://www.forbes.com/sites/kathleenchaykowski/2017/09/06/fake-facebook-accounts-likely-tied-to-russia-bought-100000-in-political-ads-company-says/, September, 6; Christians, C.G., Glasser, T., McQuail, D., Nordenstreng, K., White, R.A., (2010) Normative Theories of the Media: Journalism in Democratic Societies, , Champaign, University of Illinois Press; Coaston, J., Sen.

We assess claims that the IRA sought either to (1) support Donald Trump or (2) sow discord among the U.S. public by analyzing hyperlinks contained in 108,781 IRA tweets. Our results show that although IRA accounts promoted links to both sides of the ideological spectrum, “conservative” trolls were more active than “liberal” ones. The IRA also shared content across social media platforms, particularly YouTube—the second-most linked destination among IRA tweets. Although overall news content shared by trolls leaned moderate to conservative, we find troll accounts on both sides of the ideological spectrum, and these accounts maintain their political alignment. Links to YouTube videos were decidedly conservative, however. While mixed, this evidence is consistent with the IRA’s supporting the Republican campaign, but the IRA’s strategy was multifaceted, with an ideological division of labor among accounts. We contextualize these results as consistent with a pre-propaganda strategy. This work demonstrates the need to view political communication in the context of the broader media ecology, as governments exploit the interconnected information ecosystem to pursue covert propaganda strategies. © The Author(s) 2020.","foreign intervention; Internet Research Agency; propaganda; social media; Twitter; YouTube",,,,,,"Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, BMGF

We are interested in the question of what publics believe about their own exposure to falsehoods in news, and about what contributes to similarities and differences in these beliefs across countries. We are also interested in the question of whether publics report attempting to verify news that is suspect to them. Here we report on a comparative election survey in the United States, the United Kingdom, and France. We find three key predictors of publics’ beliefs that they have been exposed to falsehoods: discussion of news, use of social media for political purposes, and exposure to counter-attitudinal information. The nexus between these three predictors and beliefs about falsehoods exists in all three countries, as we anticipate that it likely exists elsewhere. We do not find voters on the right to be different from those on the left in the United Kingdom and France, but do find a substantial difference in the United States, which is likely due to the 2016 Trump campaign. We conclude with concerns about the imbalance in beliefs about exposure to falsehoods in the United States and the apparent capacity of a single leader, in the right context, to shape public beliefs about what is to be believed. © The Author(s) 2020.","comparative research;

However, due to data limitations, there is still no solid evidence whether populist citizens have skewed news diets in the contemporary high-choice digital media environment. In this paper, we rely on the selective exposure framework and investigate the relationship between populist attitudes and the consumption of various types of online news. To test our theoretical assumptions, we link 150 million Web site visits by 7,729 Internet users in France, Germany, Italy, Spain, the United Kingdom, and the United States to their responses in an online survey. This design allows us to measure media exposure more precisely than previous studies while linking these data to demographic attributes and political attitudes of participants. The results show that populist attitudes leave pronounced marks in people’s news diets, but the evidence is heterogeneous and highly contingent on the supply side of a country’s media system. Most importantly, citizens with populist attitudes visit less Web sites from the legacy press, while consuming more hyperpartisan news. Despite these tendencies, the Web tracking data show that populist citizens still primarily get their news from established sources. We discuss the implications of these results for the current state of public spheres in democracies. © The Author(s) 2020.","news consumption; political information; populist attitudes; selective exposure; Web tracking",,,,,,"Volkswagen Foundation: 94758","The authors disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This research has been supported by the Volkswagen Foundation, Grant No. 94758.",,,"Akkerman, A., Mudde, C., Zaslove, A., How Populist Are the People?

It is widely understood as misleading content produced to generate profits, pursue political goals, or maliciously deceive. Our starting point is the assumption that some countries are more resilient to online disinformation than others. To understand what conditions influence this resilience, we choose a comparative cross-national approach. In the first step, we develop a theoretical framework that presents these country conditions as theoretical dimensions. In the second step, we translate the dimensions into quantifiable indicators that allow us to measure their significance on a comparative cross-country basis. In the third part of the study, we empirically examine eighteen Western democracies. A cluster analysis yields three country groups: one group with high resilience to online disinformation (including the Northern European systems, for instance) and two country groups with low resilience (including the polarized Southern European countries and the United States).

Focus is placed on predictors of audience awareness of, attitudes toward, and visits to such sites within a stage model framework drawn from the persuasive message literature. Analysis of survey data from a U.S. sample shows that liberals and liberal/mainstream news consumers are more aware of, positive toward, and likely to report using fact-checking sites. Conservatives are less positive and conservative news consumers see such sites as less useful to them. Findings indicate that while specific combinations of predictors of awareness, attitudes, and behavior vary, fact-checking sites have a particular appeal to liberals and liberal/mainstream news consumers. Results point to U.S. fact-checking sites being absorbed into wider ideological discourses and patterns of ideological news consumption. © The Author(s) 2020.","fact-checking; mainstream media; news use; political ideology",,,,,,"University of Missouri, MU","The authors would like to thank the Reynolds Journalism Institute at the University of Missouri for supporting this research.

However, scholarly attention has focused on social media, overlooking the role that news media within the country played in amplifying false, foreign messages. In this article, we examine articles in the U.S. news media system that quoted IRA tweets through the lens of changing journalism practices in the hybrid media system, focusing specifically on news gatekeepers’ use of tweets as vox populi. We find that a majority of the IRA tweets embedded in the news were vox populi. That is, IRA tweets were quoted (1) for their opinion, (2) as coming from everyday Twitter users, and (3) with a collection of other tweets holistically representing public sentiment. These findings raise concerns about how modern gatekeeping practices, transformed due to the hybrid media system, may also unintentionally let in unwanted disinformation from malicious actors. © The Author(s) 2019.","journalism; journalistic norms; state-media relations; United States",,,,,,,,,,"Abrams, S., Beyond Propaganda: Soviet Active Measures in Putin’s Russia (2016) Connections: The Quarterly Journal, 15 (1), pp. 5-31; Al-Zaman, M.S., Digital Disinformation and Communalism in Bangladesh (2019) China Media Research, 15 (2), pp. 68-76; Badawy, A., Addawood, A., Lerman, K., Ferrara, E., Characterizing the 2016 Russian IRA Influence Campaign (2019) Social Network Analysis and Mining, 9, pp. 31-43; Barnard, S.R., ‘Tweet or be Sacked’: Twitter and the New Elements of Journalistic Practice (2016) Journalism, 17 (2), pp. 190-207; Beckers, K., How Ordinary is the Ordinary (Wo)man on the Street?

Applying a theoretical framework derived from the literature on the sociology of work and the transformation of the organization of politics in the Nordic welfare states, we make two theoretical points. First, special advisers are part of an emerging group of partisan policy professionals, and second, the characteristics of this group are best analyzed through the lens of the boundaryless career. By combining these two positions, we contribute to studies on special advisers by offering a longer career perspective, and we contribute to studies on the boundaryless career by analyzing a job market other than the dot-com and cultural industries. Mapping the entire career paths of all Danish special ministerial advisers from 2000 to 2017 (n = 144), we show that the position of special adviser serves as a stepping-stone to a new labor market that typically culminates with a position in private public relations. This conclusion lends fresh support to concerns about the privatization of politics changing policy formation in the Nordic welfare states. © The Author(s) 2019.","boundaryless career; partisan policy professionals; political PR; special advisers",,,,,,,,,,"Abbott, A., The Sociology of Work and Occupations (1993) Annual Review of Sociology, 19 (1), pp. 187-209; Askim, J., Karlsen, R., Kolltveit, K., Political Appointees in Executive Government: Exploring and Explaining Roles Using a Large-N Survey in Norway (2017) Public Administration, 95 (2), p. 342. , (,):, –58; Blach-Ørsten, M., The mediatzation of politics: a new institutional perspective (2016) Medialisering: mediernes rolle i social og kulturel forandring, , Hjarvard Stig, (ed), Copenhagen, Hans Reitzel,, [,] ed., 185–216; Blach-Ørsten, M., Willig, I., Pedersen, L.H., From politician to policy professional – an anlysis of the career paths of Danish politicians from 1981 to 2015 (2017) Økonomi & Politik, 90 (3), pp. 15-26. , a., [,]; Blach-Ørsten, M., Willig, I., Pedersen, L.H., PR, Lobbyism and Democracy: Mapping the MPs Who Walk through the Revolving Door between the Public and Private Sector from 1981 to 2015 (2017) Nordicom Review, 38 (2), pp. 19-32. , b; Blick, A., (2004) People Who Live in the Dark: The History of the Special Adviser in British Politics, , London, Politico; Blom-Hansen, J., Still Corporatism in Scandinavia?

Previous research on organized interests in the media revealed (1) a consistent overrepresentation of business interests across countries, but (2) also that this overrepresentation has decreased over time in a European context. However, these studies are snapshots of interest group patterns with either cross-country or longitudinal variation, and important players such as corporations have been largely excluded by European scholars. We argue that including corporations affects previous conclusions as it reveals substantial differences across countries and an increasing role of business interests in the news. We use a data set of Dutch and British news articles, in which we identified 34,657 interest organizations. This endeavor highlights that the distribution of organized interests in the media is skewed toward business interests and has not become more diverse. This suggests that the important insider role of business interests translates to outsider venues, which tells us something about how the news media maintain these patterns through the construction of news stories. These findings interfere with ideas of representativeness and flourishing democracies with a diverse public debate in which many different voices are expressed. © The Author(s) 2019.","interest groups; lobbying; newspapers; Western Europe",,,,,,,"The authors are grateful to Anne Skorkj?r Binderkrantz, Helene Helboe Pedersen, Henrik Bech Seeberg, Joost Berkhout, Ton Nijhuis, Juho Vesa, Linda Fl?the and Steven Eichenberger as well as the anonymous reviewers for providing excellent feedback on previous versions of the manuscript.

Several studies have investigated how reporters portray social movements, finding that news marginalizes protestors by focusing on spectacle and violent tactics to the detriment of their ideas. In this study, we turn to journalists’ Twitter accounts to analyze if these patterns are transferred to social media, as predicted by the literature on normalization of new affordances. Through a mixed methodology matching survey and social media data from 466 Brazilian journalists who tweeted about protests in 2013 and 2015, results revealed individual attitudes predicted coverage, indicating that social media was a space for personal, not professional, expression. Contrary to the literature, findings show that social media portrayals were more legitimizing during the left-leaning demonstrations than during the right-leaning elite-driven one. As a result, marginalizing patterns of protest coverage were challenged, not replicated, on Twitter. These findings suggest a limitation of the theory of normalization to explain how global journalists use social media. © The Author(s) 2019.","journalism; Latin America; new technologies; social movements",,,,,,,,,,"Albuquerque, A., On Models and Margins: Comparative Media Models Viewed from a Brazilian Perspective (2012) Comparing Media Systems Beyond the Western World, pp. 72-95. , Hallin Daniel C., Mancini Paolo, (eds), New York, Cambridge University Press,,. ed; Albuquerque, A., da Silva, M.A.R., Skilled, Loyal and Disciplined: The Communist Journalists and the Adaptation of the American Independent Journalism Model in Brazil (2009) The International Journal of Press/Politics, 14 (3). , (,): 376–95; Azevedo, F.A., Media and Democracy in Brazil: Relationship Between Media and Political Systems (2006) Opinião Pública, 12 (1), pp. 88-113. , [,]; Bastos, M.T., Mercea, D., Charpentier, A., Tents, Tweets, and Events: The Interplay between Ongoing Protests and Social Media (2015) Journal of Communication, 65 (2). , (,): 320–50; Bennett, W., Regina Lawrence, L., Livingston, S., (2007) When the Press Fails: Political Power and the News Media from Iraq to Katrina, , Chicago, University of Chicago Press; Conti, M.S., News from Congress (1999) Notícias do Planalto, , São Paulo, Companhia das Letras; Cottle, S., (2008) Global Crisis Reporting, , New York, NY, McGraw-Hill Education; Dardis, F.E., Marginalization Devices in US Press Coverage of Iraq War Protest: A Content Analysis (2006) Mass Communication and Society, 9 (2). , (,): 117–35; Deuze, M., The Professional Identity of Journalists in the Context of Convergence Culture (2008) Observatorio (Obs*), 2 (4). , (,): 103–117; Freelon, D., ReCal OIR: Ordinal, Interval, and Ratio Intercoder Reliability as a Web Service (2013) International Journal of Internet Science, 8 (1), pp. 10-16; García Canclini, N., (1997) Hybrid Cultures: Strategies for Entering and Leaving Modernity, , Minneapolis, University of Minnesota Press; Gitlin, T., (1980) The Whole World Is Watching: Mass Media in the Making & Unmaking of the New Left, , Berkeley, University of California Press; Hallin, D.C., Mancini, P., (2004) Comparing Media Systems, , Cambridge, Cambridge University Press; Hanusch, F., ‘Political Journalists’ Corporate and Personal Identities on Twitter Profile Pages: A Comparative Analysis in Four Westminster Democracies (2018) New Media & Society, 20 (4). , (,): 1488–505; Harlow, S., Johnson, T.J., The Arab Spring| Overthrowing the Protest Paradigm?

Although many studies have focused on detecting deepfakes, few have measured their effects on political attitudes, and none have studied microtargeting techniques as an amplifier. We argue that microtargeting techniques can amplify the effects of deepfakes, by enabling malicious political actors to tailor deepfakes to susceptibilities of the receiver. In this study, we have constructed a political deepfake (video and audio), and study its effects on political attitudes in an online experiment (N = 278). We find that attitudes toward the depicted politician are significantly lower after seeing the deepfake, but the attitudes toward the politician’s party remain similar to the control condition. When we zoom in on the microtargeted group, we see that both the attitudes toward the politician and the attitudes toward his party score significantly lower than the control condition, suggesting that microtargeting techniques can indeed amplify the effects of a deepfake, but for a much smaller subgroup than expected. © The Author(s) 2020.","deepfake; disinformation; political attitudes; political microtargeting",,,,,,,,,,"Abramowitz, A.I., The Electoral Roots of America’s Dysfunctional Government (2013) Presidential Studies Quarterly, 43 (4). , (, ): 709–31; Adams, W.C., Smith, D.J., Salzman, A., Crossen, R., Hieber, S., Naccarato, T., Vantine, W., Weisbroth, N., Before and after the Day after: The Unexpected Results of a Televised Drama (1986) Political Communication, 3 (3), pp. 191-213; Afchar, D., Nozick, V., Yamagishi, J., Echizen, I., (2018) MesoNet: A Compact Facial Video Forgery Detection Network, , 10th IEEE International Workshop on Information Forensics and Security, WIFS, December 2018, 1–7; Agarwal, S., Varshney, L.R., Limits of Deepfake Detection: A Robust Estimation Viewpoint (2019), http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.03493; Appelman, A., Sundar, S., Measuring Message Credibility: Construction and Validation of an Exclusive Scale (2016) Journalism & Mass Communication Quarterly, 93 (1), pp. 59-79; Arendt, H., (1951) The Origins of Totalitarianism, , Orlando, Florida, Harcourt; Asmolov, G., The Disconnective Power of Disinformation Campaigns (2018) Journal of International Affairs, 71 (15), pp. 69-77; Democratic Defense against Disinformation 2.0 (2019), https://www.brookings.edu/research/democratic-defense-against-disinformation-2-0/; Bail, C.A., Guay, B., Maloney, E., Combs, A., Hillygus, D.S., Merhout, F., Freelon, D., Volfovsky, A., Assessing the Russian Internet Research Agency’s Impact on the Political Attitudes and Behaviors of American Twitter Users in Late 2017 (2020) Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, 117. , 243–50; Baldwin-Philippi, J., Data Campaigning: Between Empirics and Assumptions (2019) Internet Policy Review, 4, p. 18. , https://doi.org/10.14763/2019, 1437; Bennett, W.L., Iyengar, S., A New Era of Minimal Effects?

In this paper, we conduct three survey experiments to assess the direct and unconditioned effect of exposure to tweets on perceived ideological polarization of candidates and parties. We show that subjects treated with negative tweets see greater ideological distance between presidential nominees and between their parties. We also demonstrate that polarization increases with processing time. We demonstrate a social media effect on perceived polarization beyond that due to the self-selection of like-minded users into different media communities. We explain our results as the result of social media frames that increase contrast effects between voters and candidates. © The Author(s) 2020.","framing; polarization; political polarization; social media; Twitter",,,,,,,,,,"Ansolabehere, S., Schaffner, B.F., (2017) CCES Common Content, 2016; Arceneaux, K., Johnson, M., Changing Minds or Changing Channels?

As social media users mobilize politically by acquiring varied political information from other users, social media use created more incentives for citizens to participate in both pro- and anti-impeachment protests during the scandal. Given that social media is an important arena for political activism, participation in rival protests also influences many motivated protesters to strengthen their side’s voices online. Thus, protests may increase citizens’ political use of social media. Our empirical analysis suggests that social network service use does not influence citizens’ political activities in a unidirectional manner.

We propose that unsupervised machine learning techniques for text data, specifically the combination of a text scaling method and latent topic modeling, can be applied to estimate ideal points of media outlets. We applied our proposed methods to editorial texts of ten national and regional newspapers in Japan, where prior approaches are not applicable because newspapers have never officially endorsed particular parties or candidates, and because high-quality training data for supervised learning are not available. Our two studies, one of which analyzed editorials on a single typically ideological topic while the other investigated all editorials published by the target papers in one year, confirmed the popular view of Japanese newspapers’ ideological slant, which validates the effectiveness of our proposed approach. We also illustrate that our methods allow scholars to investigate which issues are closely related to the respective ideological positions of media outlets. Furthermore, we use the estimated ideal points of newspapers to show that Japanese people partially tend to read ideologically like-minded newspapers and follow such newspapers’ Twitter accounts even though their slant is not explicit. © The Author(s) 2020.","ideal point estimation; Japan; media slant; quantitative text analysis; unsupervised learning",,,,,,"Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, JSPS: JP18K12708, JP19J21170, JP18J12661","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was supported by the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science KAKENHI Grant Number JP18K12708, JP18J12661, and JP19J21170.",,,"Abe, Y., The Nuclear Power Debate after Fukushima: A Text-Mining Analysis of Japanese Newspapers (2015) Contemporary Japan, 27 (2), pp. 89-110; Akuto, H., Media in Electoral Campaigning in Japan and the United States (1996) Media and Politics in Japan, , Pharr Susan J., Krauss Ellis S., (eds), Honolulu, University of Hawaii Press,,. ed., 313–37; Ansolabehere, S., Lessem, R., Snyder, J.M., Jr., The Orientation of Newspaper Endorsements in U.S. Elections, 1940–2002 (2006) Quarterly Journal of Political Science, 1 (4), pp. 393-404; Bakshy, E., Messing, S., Adamic, L.A., Exposure to Ideologically Diverse News and Opinion on Facebook (2015) Science, 348 (6239). , (,): 1130–32; Barberá, P., Birds of the Same Feather Tweet Together: Bayesian Ideal Point Estimation Using Twitter Data (2015) Political Analysis, 23 (1), pp. 76-91; Benoit, K., Conway, D., Lauderdale, B.E., Laver, M., Mikhaylov, S., Crowd-Sourced Text Analysis: Reproducible and Agile Production of Political Data (2016) American Political Science Review, 110 (2). , (,): 278–95; Bonica, A., Inferring Roll-Call Scores from Campaign Contributions Using Supervised Machine Learning (2018) American Journal of Political Science, 62 (4). , (,): 830–48; Bou-Hamad, I., Yehya, N.A., Partisan Selective Exposure in TV Consumption Patterns: A Polarized Developing Country Context (2020) Communication Research, 47 (1), pp. 55-81; Budak, C., Goel, S., Rao, J.M., Fair and Balanced?

This study tested the potential of subtle ideological cues to redress the balance. By spotlighting visual rather than the already much-examined verbal cues, we sought to contribute to building theory on cue effects. Specifically, we aimed to determine whether the effects from the literature on verbal cues could also be shown for visual ones. We used an experiment (N = 361) to test the effects of subtle backdrop cues (SBCs), that is, of visual cues to ideology embedded in the background of political images. We manipulated photos of a fictitious politician to include liberal or conservative SBCs. We embedded these images in Twitter posts and tested whether they influenced perceptions of the politician’s ideology and the intention to vote for him. We analyzed the relationship between exposure to SBCs, the politician’s perceived political ideology, and voting intention—including the study of conditional effects elicited by cue awareness and ideological consistency between the depicted politician and participant. The conditional process analysis suggested that SBCs mattered, as they influenced citizens’ perceptions of a politician’s political ideology, and consequently, voting intention. These effects were moderated by cue awareness and ideological consistency.

This is evident from the partisan economic perception gap: Government supporters have more positive economic perceptions than opposition supporters, especially when the economic situation is ambiguous. Recent research has shown that the size of this partisan gap varies across different contexts and that the state of the economy and working of political institutions are important moderators. Still, little is known about the influence of another important contextual variable: the degree of partisanship in the media system. Based on a theoretical discussion of partisan-motivated rationalization and the information environment, the paper tests the hypothesis that, due to selective exposure and exposure to more partisan content, people in partisan media systems have more polarized economic perceptions. A multilevel analysis of representative surveys in twenty-six European countries in 2014 shows that the partisan perception gap is, indeed, larger in countries with more polarized media systems, after controlling for other relevant country characteristics. People with the highest level of media consumption are most affected by media-party parallelism. The findings are relevant for worldwide discussions about posttruth politics, as they show that the media environment influences gaps in people’s perceptions of real-world developments. © The Author(s) 2020.","comparative research; economic news; economic perceptions; media; media systems; partisan motivated reasoning",,,,,,,,,,"(2014) Political Journalism in Comparative Perspective, , Cambridge, Cambridge University Press; Anson, I.G., Just the Facts?

Yet, little is known about the effect these portrayals have on the visual attention of voters and their impressions of the traits of the politicians depicted. This exploratory study examines the effects of visual self-personalization (professional vs. private focus) by Finnish political leaders of both genders on Instagram. Through a pilot laboratory study, viewers’ visual attention was measured using eye-tracking technology and, in combination with this, leader trait impressions were experimentally examined. The results indicate that photos depicting politicians in professional settings are more attention grabbing and effective in shaping trait impressions than photos showing politicians in private life. Among the recommendations for future research, it is noted that gender aspects should be further explored as this study, by focusing on a gender-egalitarian country, had a limited scope in that respect. © The Author(s) 2020.","eye-tracking; Instagram; party leader; politics; self-personalization; social media",,,,,,,,,,"Åström, J., Karlsson, M., The Feminine Style, the Male Influence, and the Paradox of Gendered Political Blogspace (2016) Information, Communication & Society, 19 (11). , (,): 1636–52; Avedissian, K., Clerics, Weightlifters, and Politicians: Ramzan Kadyrov’s Instagram as an Official Project of Chechen Memory and Identity Production (2016) Caucasus Survey, 4 (1), pp. 20-43; Bittner, A., (2011) Platform or Personality?

This has been most evident in Britain in terms of the controversial vote to exit the European Union (EU) during the 2016 referendum (to Leave or Remain) and more recently with the lead up to a general election and mounting pressure on the government to implement an exit strategy. The most vocal proponent of the “leave” movement was the United Kingdom Independence Party (UKIP), reframing the debate on EU membership in terms of invasion and oppression. This paper focuses on precisely this discursive construction of the EU by analyzing UKIP campaign posters through application of Bhatia’s Discourse of Illusion framework on three levels: historicity (use of the past to justify the present or predict the future), linguistic and semiotic action (subjective conceptualizations of reality made apparent through metaphorical rhetoric), and degree of social impact (emergence of delineating categories through ideological narrative). © The Author(s) 2020.","Brexit; categorization; discourse of illusion; historicity; metaphor; UKIP",,,,,,,,,,"Bale, T., Who Leads and Who Follows?

To assess the potential effect of this coverage on readers’ efficacy, we conduct a two-wave population-based survey experiment on members of Generation Z, the Millennial generation, and Generation X that frames the movement as a success or failure in terms of achieving its political goals. Results show that emphasis framing impacts readers’ perceptions of the movement’s likely success in line with the manipulation. Furthermore, framing the YMGVP as unsuccessful suppresses readers’ own external and collective efficacy regardless of generation. Subjects’ support for gun control moderates the effect of treatment, such that individuals low in support express a decline in internal and information efficacy when presented with the success framing. Thus, we extend the effects of news framing beyond attitudes toward the subjects of reporting to readers’ own perceptions of themselves as capable of political action. © The Author(s) 2020.","collective efficacy; emphasis framing; mass shootings; political efficacy; social movements",,,,,,,,,,"Acock, A., Clarke, H., Marianne C, S., A New Model for Old Measures: A Covariance Structure Analysis of Political Efficacy (1985) Journal of Politics, 47, pp. 1062-1084; Alter, C., The School Shooting Generation Has Had Enough (2018) Time, , http://time.com/longform/never-again-movement/, March 22., (accessed October 1, 2018; Bandura, A., (1997) Self-Efficacy: The Exercise of Control, , W.

In this study, we examine adolescents’ affective (emotions, feelings), behavioral (actions and behavioral intentions), and cognitive (political knowledge) responses to interpersonal political discussion on WhatsApp. We conducted a preregistered field experiment at six secondary schools in the Netherlands (N = 230). We assigned respondents with strong ties to a WhatsApp group. For seven days, respondents received a link to an online political news item on a daily basis; and (1) either had to read or (2) read and discuss it. The results indicate that interpersonal discussion evokes stronger positive emotions and feelings, as well as issue-specific knowledge. In addition, elaboration on the content of political discussion was positively related to issue-specific knowledge. In this way, instant messaging apps may serve as a resource for engaging adolescents with politics and current events. © The Author(s) 2020.","adolescents; experimental research; instant messaging; news consumption; political knowledge; WhatsApp",,,,,,,,,,"Anspach, N.M., The New Personal Influence: How Our Facebook Friends Influence the News We Read (2017) Political Communication, 34 (4), pp. 590-606; Baptista, E.A., Rossini, P., Veiga de Oliveira, V., Stromer-Galley, J., A circulação da (des)informação política no WhatsApp e no Facebook [The circulation of political (mis)information on WhatsApp and Facebook].

Focusing on the June 2013 protests in Brazil, this article takes the discussion in a different conceptual and empirical direction, examining the forces that, according to national, alternative, and foreign journalists, shaped the coverage of violence during those demonstrations. Drawing on forty-three in-depth interviews, the accounts of these individuals confirm the need to move beyond deterministic approaches suggested by the protest paradigm, acknowledging that the mediated visibility of violence does neither invariably lead to support for the status quo nor to a demonization of social unrest. News coverage of violence emerges alternatively as an instrument with the potential to be strategically exploited for diverse political, ideological, and commercial purposes. A closer examination of the frictional processes leading up to mediated visibility also recognizes that sensationalism and drama are not exclusive to the mainstream media. Despite their potential to broaden the mediated visibility of protest, alternative and foreign journalists may narrate demonstrations as politically legitimate but ultimately shallow spectacles, where the drama of violence—committed by either authorities or demonstrators—obscures the underlying grievances driving people on to the streets. The views of journalists are an important contribution to debates about protest news coverage, given the scarcity of studies examining their accounts during these episodes. © The Author(s) 2020.","alternative media; Brazil; foreign correspondents; Hannah Arendt; journalism; mediated visibility; protest paradigm",,,,,,,,,,"Arendt, H., (1970) On Violence, , San Diego, Harvest; https://abraji.org.br/noticias/abraji-revela-que-foram-intencionais-70-das-113-agressoes-a-jornalistas-nas-manifestacoes-de-2013, Associação Brasileira de Jornalismo Investigativo.

There is a long tradition of studies on this topic, but they have mostly focused on legacy news media, thus overlooking the role of other actors and the complex hybrid dynamics that characterize contemporary political communication. In contrast, through an in-depth case study using mixed-methods and multiplatform data, this article provides a detailed analysis of the roles and interactions between different types of media and how they were used by political and advocacy elites. It explores what happened in the different parts of the system, and thus the paths to attention that led to setting this issue in the political and media agendas. The analysis of the case, a partial policy reversal in the United Kingdom provoked by an immigration scandal known as the “Windrush scandal” reveals that the issue was pushed into the agenda by a campaign assemblage of investigative journalism, political and advocacy elites, and digitally enabled leaders. The legacy news media came late but were crucial. They greatly amplified the salience of the issue and, once in “storm mode,” they were key for sustaining attention and pressure, eventually compelling the government to respond. It shows that they often remain at the core of the “national conversation” and certainly in the eye of a media storm. In the contemporary context, characterized by fierce battles for attention, shortening attention spans and fractured audiences, this is key and has important implications for agenda setting and beyond. © The Author(s) 2020.","assemblage; electronic petitions; legacy media; political agenda setting; Windrush",,,,,,,,,,"Atkinson, M.L., Measuring the Media Agenda (2014) Political Communication, 31 (2), pp. 355-380; Bennett, W.L., The Logic of Connective Action: Digital Media and the Personalization of Contentious Politics (2012) Information, Communication & Society, 15 (5), pp. 739-768. , and; Bennett, W.L., The Strength of Peripheral Networks: Negotiating Attention and Meaning in Complex Media Ecologies (2018) Journal of Communication, 68 (4), pp. 659-684; Boydstun, A.E., Two Faces of Media Attention: Media Storm Versus Non-Storm Coverage (2014) Political Communication, 31 (4), pp. 509-531; Chadwick, A., The Political Information Cycle in a Hybrid News System: The British Prime Minister and the ‘Bullygate’ Affair (2011) The International Journal of Press/Politics, 16 (1), pp. 3-29; Chadwick, A., (2017) The Hybrid Media System: Politics and Power, , Oxford, Oxford University Press; Chadwick, A., Boundary-Drawing Power and the Renewal of Professional News Organizations: The Case of the Guardian and the Edward Snowden National Security Agency Leak (2014) International Journal of Communication, 8, pp. 2420-2441. , and; Chadwick, A., Dennis, J., Smith, A.P., (2015) “Politics in the age of hybrid media: Power, systems, and media logics, pp. 7-22. , ”.

In what circumstances might such journalists resist the diplomatic strategies of their funding states? We address these questions through a comparative study of journalists working for international news organizations funded by the Chinese, US, UK and Qatari governments. Using 52 interviews with journalists covering humanitarian issues, we explain how they minimized tensions between their diplomatic role and dominant norms of journalistic autonomy by drawing on three – broadly shared – legitimizing narratives, involving different kinds of boundary-work. In, the first ‘exclusionary’ narrative, journalists differentiated their ‘truthful’ news reporting from the ‘false’ state ‘propaganda’ of a common Other, the Russian-funded network, RT. In the second ‘fuzzifying’ narrative, journalists deployed the ambiguous notion of ‘soft power’ as an ambivalent ‘boundary concept’, to defuse conflicts between journalistic and diplomatic agendas. In the final ‘inversion’ narrative, journalists argued that, paradoxically, their dependence on funding states gave them greater ‘operational autonomy’. Even when journalists did resist their funding states, this was hidden or partial, and prompted less by journalists’ concerns about the political effects of their work, than by serious threats to their personal cultural capital. © The Author(s) 2020.","censorship; comparative research; global news agencies; journalism; satellite television; state-media relations",,,,,,,,,,"(2018), https://www.aljazeera.com/programmes/listeningpost/2018/06/journalism-propaganda-state-sponsored-media-180602110533574.html, Journalism or Propaganda?

This study uses an experimental design on a national sample to test two features of user-based correction strategies on Instagram for a divisive issue on which misinformation abounds: the issue of climate change. First, we unite the inoculation and correction literature to test the efficacy of prebunking corrections that come before exposure to the misinformation versus debunking strategies that occur after exposure. Second, we compare fact-focused corrections that provide accurate information to rebut the misinformation against logic-focused corrections that highlight the rhetorical flaw underpinning the misinformation. Our findings suggest that these strategies intersect to reduce misperceptions. Logic-focused corrections effectively reduce misperceptions regardless of their placement before or after the misinformation, and appear to function in part by reducing perceptions of the credibility of the misinformation post. Fact-focused corrections only reduce misperceptions when they occur after the misinformation, but are seen as more credible than logic-focused corrections.

We specifically focus on two elements of campaign content: the tone of the campaign (i.e., whether or not to go “negative” on opponents) and the use of emotional appeals (fear and enthusiasm messages). We argue that both negativity and emotions matter for media coverage. We rely on an original comparative data set about the campaign strategies of 507 candidates having competed in 107 elections in 89 countries worldwide between 2016 and 2019. The data set is based on a survey distributed to samples of national and international experts. Confirming our expectations, the analyses reveal that candidates using a more negative tone and, especially, candidates making a greater use of emotional appeals receive a greater media coverage; the effect of emotional appeals dwarfs all other drivers of media coverage. Our analyses also show that media coverage is significantly higher for candidates who go negative and use fear appeals, and when candidates go positive and use enthusiasm appeals. Finally, media coverage is significantly greater for candidates who go negative in countries where the media system has a marked preference for infotainment and sensationalism. © The Author(s) 2020.","comparative political communication; elections; emotions; media coverage; negative campaigning",,,,,,"Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur FÃ¶rderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung, SNSF","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: Alessandro Nai acknowledges the support of the Swiss National Science Foundation (Grant Ref.

Existing studies show that media attention is concentrated on a relatively small number of well-resourced groups, often representing economic interests. However, the literature still struggles to disentangle the reasons behind this bias in media attention. Is it explained by media selection practices or uneven interest group activity? We cannot separate these two possible mechanisms by simply studying aggregate levels of media attention. In this study, we therefore compare the set of groups that lobby in specific policy areas with the groups that appear in the news on issues related to those same policy areas. The investigation is based on data from Denmark and the United Kingdom. First, we use survey data to identify the policy areas in which groups actively lobby. Second, we identify groups’ media appearances in news stories related to those same policy areas. Third, we compare diversity among the groups actively lobbying with the groups actually appearing in the news and investigate possible biases. We find that even when the analysis of media appearances is narrowed down to only those groups active in a policy area, the news media allow more access to well-resourced groups. However, in contrast to previous findings, differences in media appearances across interest group types are not reproduced. These results imply that media selection biases are mainly produced by varying lobbying resources rather than discrimination based on the type of interests that groups represent. © The Author(s) 2020.","advocacy; cixvil society; interest groups; media bias",,,,,,"Danmarks Frie Forskningsfond, DFF: 0602-01212B","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This research was supported by the Independent Research Fund Denmark (Grant No. 0602-01212B).",,,"Andrews, K.T., Caren, N., Making the News: Movement Organizations, Media Attention, and the Public Agenda (2010) American Sociological Review, 75 (6). , (, ): 841–66; Bennett, W.L., Toward a Theory of Press-State Relations in the United States (1990) Journal of Communication, 40 (2). , (, ): 103–25; Berkhout, J., Why Interest Organizations Do What They Do: Assessing the Explanatory Potential of ‘Exchange’ Approaches (2013) Interest Groups and Advocacy, 2 (2). , (, ): 227–50; Bernhagen, P., Trani, B., Interest Group Mobilization and Lobbying Patterns in Britain: A Newspaper Analysis (2012) Interest Groups and Advocacy, 1 (1), pp. 48-66; Beyers, J., Voice and Access: Political Practices of European Interest Associations (2004) European Union Politics, 5. , 211–40; Binderkrantz, A.S., Interest Group Strategies: Navigating between Privileged Access and Strategies of Pressure (2005) Political Studies, 53, pp. 694-715; Binderkrantz, A.S., Interest Groups in the Media: Bias and Diversity Over Time (2012) European Journal of Political Research, 51 (1). , (, ): 117–39; Binderkrantz, A.S., Chaqués Bonafont, L., Halpin, D., Diversity in the News?

Findings show that seniority, committee or party leadership, commenting on devolution and corruption, and criticizing government emerged as the main predictors of the parliamentarians’ coverage in news media.

Taking an institutional approach by focusing on institutional influences on the conception–performance gap at three levels (individual, organizational, societal), our results show that these gaps are largest for the two roles most connected with the public functions of journalism, the civic, and the watchdog roles. Multilevel analyses offer significant evidence on that, across all six analyzed roles, the size of the gaps differed more clearly between journalists and between media organizations, than among countries. Although influences on an individual level (i.e., perceived autonomy) have some explanatory power, influences on the organizational level and, more specifically, ownership and codified editorial policies are the factors that best explain conception–performance gaps. The implications of these findings are discussed in light of the public skepticism about the performance of journalism and the media. © The Author(s) 2020.","autonomy; comparative research; journalism; media studies; professional roles; role performance",,,,,,"Fondo Nacional de Desarrollo CientÃ­fico y TecnolÃ³gico, FONDECYT: 1150153

However, this view of persistent media bias against women politicians is increasingly subject to pressure by inconsistent evidence of size and patterns of gender bias. This paper argues that some of these inconsistencies derive from a lack of attention to contextual influences of electoral coverage. This study analyzes gender bias in the amount and content of media coverage in the run-up to Swiss federal elections in 2015 by means of a quantitative content analysis. Drawing on an extensive sample of print, online and audiovisual election coverage from the most important tabloid and broadsheet media of three different language regions, the results reveal mixed evidence of gender bias: On the one hand, women candidates remain underrepresented in Swiss media. On the other hand, however, once they are covered by the media, candidates are overwhelmingly presented in a gender-neutral way. Several differences emerge between language regions and media type. Extending the traditional gender bias hypothesis to account for contextual influences, the study illustrates that the geo-cultural and media-specific contextual influences of election coverage impinge on the gendered mediation of candidates together with known drivers of political communication, such as incumbency, the electoral system, and party ideology. © The Author(s) 2020.","election campaign; gender; media bias; news reporting",,,,,,,"The authors disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: The authors received financial support for the research project of this article by the Federal Office of Communications OFCOM, the Federal Commission for Women’s Issues FCWI, and the Swiss Broadcasting Corporation SRG SSR.",,,"Abele, A.E., Wojciszke, B., Communal and Agentic Content in Social Cognition: A Dual Perspective Model (2014) Advances in Experimental Social Psychology, 50, pp. 195-255; Bochsler, D., Gerber, M., Zumbach, D., The 2015 National Elections in Switzerland: Renewed polarization and shift to the right (2016) Regional & Federal Studies, 26 (1), pp. 95-106; Bochsler, D., Hänggli, R., Häusermann, S., Consensus Lost?

Yet, paradoxically, the digital age also provides new opportunities for journalism, enabling innovations in investigative reporting on a global scale. However, the transition of investigative journalism from a single newsroom to a multi-newsroom model—involving large-scale transnational collaboration, use of social media networks to extend audience reach and impact, and data journalism to analyze mass data leaks—is understudied. This paper adapts a conceptual framework usually applied to large-scale political protest movements to large-scale collaborative investigative journalism. It aims to show how Lance Bennett and Alexandra Segerberg’s “logic of connective action” can be adapted to understand different forms of networked action such as global collaborative watchdog reporting. Bennett and Segerberg identify three distinct types of large-scale protest formations and this paper contends that these can be approximated to fit different types of large-scale transnational collaborative investigative journalism. Using a case study methodology and interviews with investigative journalists, the article develops a framework to differentiate between types of large-scale investigative collaborations. The framework helps to understand differences between the collaborative investigative reporting efforts of the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ), WikiLeaks, and Edward Snowden’s National Security Agency (NSA) leaks. Taking an interdisciplinary approach, this article seeks to advance theoretical understandings of global watchdog reporting in the digital age. © The Author(s) 2020.","democracy; global news; investigative journalism; journalistic norms; new technologies; social movements",,,,,,,,,,"Aucoin, J.L., (2006) The Evolution of American Investigative Journalism, , Columbia, University of Missouri Press; Bennett, L.W., Segerberg, A., (2013) The Logic of Connective Action: Digital Media and the Personalization of Contentious Politics, , Cambridge, Cambridge University Press; Berglez, P., For a Transnational Journalistic Mode of Writing (2007) Ideological Horizons in the Media and among Citizens, pp. 147-161. , Hoijer Birgitta, (ed), Göteborg, Nordicom,,. ed; Berglez, P., What Is Global Journalism?

Based on a content analysis of 33,640 news stories from sixty-four media outlets in eighteen countries, we measure and compare both orientations across different countries using three performative aspects of monitoring: intensity of scrutiny, voice of the scrutiny, and source of the event. Our findings show that the interventionist approach of watchdog journalism is more likely to be found in democracies with traditionally partisan and opinion-oriented journalistic cultures or experiencing sociopolitical crises. In turn, the detached orientation predominates in democracies with journalistic traditions associated to objectivity. Although both orientations have a lower presence in transitional democracies, the detached watchdog prevails, while in non-democratic countries the watchdog role is almost absent. Our results also reveal that structural contexts of undemocratic political regimes and restricted press freedom are key definers of watchdog role performance overall. However, the type of political regime is actually more important—and in fact the most important predictor—for detached than for interventionist reporting. © The Author(s) 2019.","comparative studies; journalism; journalistic performance; professional roles; watchdog role",,,,,,"12406914

I exploit this event to study the relationship between perceived popularity on social media (amplified through the use of bot accounts) and online political expression. The analysis uses more than two hundred thousand tweets spanning six months around the event and employs a quasi-experimental empirical framework. Following the closure of the accounts, the volume of tweets mentioning the president increased by an estimated 33 percent, with a differential increase for critical messages. Relative to tweets by government leaders, the number of likes for tweets by opposition leaders increased by an estimated 21 percent. Consistent with the presence of a spiral of silence in online political expression, the results suggest that the change in the perceived popularity of Maduro led to an increase in users’ willingness to express both criticism of the president and support for the opposition. While previous studies have documented how autocratic governments engage in manipulative online campaigns, this paper provides evidence of their effectiveness and highlights an important mechanism through which they can influence behavior. © The Author(s) 2019.","bots; event study; political expression; social media; spiral of silence",,,,,,,"I thank the editor, Cristian Vaccari, and four anonymous referees for their careful reviews and helpful suggestions.

By means of face-to-face elite interviews with Dutch MPs, we explore who politicians perceive as “the People,” how they assess “the will of the People,” and how this translates into their communication strategies. We find that MPs distinguish between listening to individual opinion, to understand what topics are at the forefront of “the People’s” minds, and taking political action considering a more general public. MPs are divided in their acceptance of the term “the People”—some find it useful, while others voice concerns over its antipluralistic implications. We find evidence of populist communication strategies in the form of references to public opinion across the political spectrum. Political communication is used for political marketing and to connect to the electorate. We conclude that Dutch MPs are not becoming more populist across the political spectrum, but rather that there is a tendency toward personalization and authenticity in political communication, which makes “normal” political communication appear more populist. © The Author(s) 2019.","citizens; democracy; parliament; political perceptions; public opinion",,,,,,,,,,"Aalberg, T., Esser, F., Reinemann, C., Stromback, J., de Vreese, C.H., (2016) Populist Political Communication in Europe, 1. , New York, Routledge, eds; Abts, K., Rummens, S., Populism versus Democracy (2007) Political Studies, 55 (2), p. 405. , (,):, –24; Andeweg, R.B., Thomassen, J.A., Modes of Political Representation: Toward a New Typology (2005) Legislative Studies Quarterly, 30 (4), p. 507. , (,):, –28; Blumer, H., Public Opinion and Public Opinion Polling (1948) American Sociological Review, 13 (5), p. 542. , (,):, –49; Bos, L., van der Brug, W., de Vreese, C.H., An Experimental Test of the Impact of Style and Rhetoric on the Perception of Right-Wing Populist and Mainstream Party Leaders (2013) Acta Politica, 48 (2), pp. 192-208; Braun, V., Clarke, V., (2013) Successful Qualitative Research: A Practical Guide for Beginners, , London, Sage; Canovan, M., ‘People,’ Politicians and Populism.

We rely on an extensive data set of international news agency coverage and a range of economic indicators retrieved from Eurostat. Employing fixed-effects pooled time series and multilevel models, we demonstrate that negative news coverage is negatively associated with consumer confidence, generally. Confirming our hypotheses grounded in media system dependency theory, more specifically, this association was stronger for the sociotropic attribute of consumer confidence than its egocentric attribute. Moreover, the association weakened under circumstances where unemployment was rising as well as in those countries that faced the most severe consequences of the financial crisis. Altogether, news coverage matters especially when people are affected less directly by the consequences of economic downturn. © The Author(s) 2019.","consumer confidence; economic perceptions; media effects; media system dependency theory",,,,,,"Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek, NWO

For some analysts, social media can create a vibrant space for political discussion, whereas others believe they do not provide the right conditions for meaningful interaction and could even have negative effects on public opinion by, for instance, fostering communication within isolated enclaves. Focusing on the debate surrounding Catalonia’s secession, this article analyses the interaction on Twitter between the opposite sides of this divisive political issue. Carefully based on a nonbiased random sampling procedure, we describe Twitter conversations through network and content analyses, using both indicators of the structure of conversations and opinion diversity. Remarkably, we find that Twitter users cross lines of difference and interact with people holding opposing views. Through a regression analysis, we show that the level of reciprocity, understood as repeated interaction and measured by the depth of the conversation, is explained by heterogeneity and associated with a higher involvement of the pro-independence side. However, if heterogeneity is combined with extremism, the development of longer conversations is severely cut. Overall, this article points toward the actual use of social media as a space for cross-cutting communication and debate despite strong disagreement. © The Author(s) 2019.","Catalonia; deliberation; public opinion; secession; social media",,,,,,,,,,"Ahn, T.K., Huckfeldt, R., Ryan, J.B., (2014) Experts, Activists, and Democratic Politics: Are Electorates Self-Educating?, , Cambridge, Cambridge University Press; Allcott, H., Gentzkow, M., Social Media and Fake News in the 2016 Election (2017) The Journal of Economic Perspectives, 31 (2), p. 211. , (,):, –35; Aragón, P., Deliberative Platform Design: The Case Study of the Online Discussions in Decidim Barcelona (2017) Social Informatics, p. 277. , Ciampaglia Giovanni Luca, Mashhadi Afra, Yasseri Taha, (eds),,. ed., –87.

In addition to covering aggregate survey trends, journalists occasionally conduct follow-up interviews with respondents from those surveys to present the views of real people in news stories. The practice of reporting these “qualitative quotes” has existed for decades, yet, there has been little scrutiny of the voices that appear in news stories or their effect on public opinion. We examine this phenomenon in the context of the United States with a historical examination of New York Times stories and other major U.S. outlets that contain polling information and follow-up interviews. Consistent with past work on exemplars, there is considerable evidence for the nonrandom nature of the people invited to comment for news stories. In particular, the use of qualitative quotes reinforces some of the biases that exist in news sourcing more generally. Finally, we demonstrate in an experiment that qualitative quotes influence policy attitudes as least as much as aggregate polling figures. © The Author(s) 2019.","media coverage; opinion polls; polling; survey",,,,,,,,,,"Aalberg, T., van Aelst, P., Curran, J., Media Systems and the Political Information Environment: A Cross-National Comparison (2010) The International Journal of Press/Politics, 15 (3), p. 255. , (,):, –71; Althaus, S.L., (2003) Collective Preferences in Democratic Politics: Opinion Surveys and the Will of the People, , New York, Cambridge University Press; Anderson, C.W., (2018) Apostles of Certainty: Data Journalism and the Politics of Doubt, , New York, Oxford University Press; Armstrong, C.L., The Influence of Reporter Gender on Source Selection in Newspaper Stories (2004) Journalism & Mass Communication Quarterly, 81 (1), p. 139. , (,):, –54; Arpan, L.M., The Effects of Exemplification on Perceptions of News Credibility (2009) Mass Communication and Society, 12, p. 249. , –70; Beckers, K., How Ordinary Is the Ordinary (Wo)man on the Street?

We rely on a unique web-tracking online dataset from Spain to identify points of access to news outlets and study the influence of direct navigation and news-referred platforms (i.e., from Facebook and Google) on selective exposure. We also explore cross-level interactions between origins to news and political interest and ideology. We find that direct navigation increases selective exposure while Google reduces it. We also find that the relationship between origins to news and selective exposure is strongly moderated by ideology, suggesting that search engines and social media are not content neutral. Our findings suggest a rather complex picture regarding selective exposure online. © The Author(s) 2019.","digital technologies; filter bubbles; media exposure; online selective exposure; platforms",,,,,,"CSO2013-47082-P","The authors disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: The research reported in this paper has been funded by the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness under grant CSO2013-47082-P.",,,"(2014) About the Alexa’s Traffic Rankings, , www.alexa.com/help/traffic-learn-more; Anderson, M., Jiang, J., Liberal Democrats More Likely than Other Groups to be Politically Active on Social Media (2018) Fact Tank, , http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/11/05/liberal-democrats-more-likely-than-other-groups-to-be-politically-active-on-social-media/; Athey, S., Mobius, M., Pál, J., (2017) The Impact of Aggregators on Internet News Consumption, , Stanford University, Stanford,,.

Accordingly, we analyze whether the political distance between editors and journalists (i.e., reporters) affects the careers of journalists in terms of rank and salary, as well as their perceived professional autonomy. We hypothesize that editors reward and allow freedom to journalists whose political viewpoints coincide more precisely with their own. Political proximity to editors should lead to a better salary and rank for reporters and to a stronger perception of editorial autonomy among reporters. We tested our hypotheses through statistical analysis using data from the Worlds of Journalism Study. We analyzed the answers of 3,087 journalists interviewed between 2012 and 2016 in six European countries: Germany, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, and the United Kingdom. The results support our hypotheses. The analysis reveals a polarization of media outlet editors, and robust results were achieved via a measure of political proximity that takes into account the particular influence of left-leaning and right-leaning editors. Such partisan leaning, however, seems less relevant in countries belonging to Hallin and Mancini’s Atlantic model. © The Author(s) 2019.","journalists’ autonomy; journalists’ careers; media bias; media polarization; political preferences",,,,,,,,,,"Adams, J., Merrill, S., Grofman, B., (2005) A Unified Theory of Party Competition: A Cross-national Analysis Integrating Spatial and Behavioral Factors, , Cambridge, Cambridge University Press; Bantz, C., News Organizations: Conflict as Crafted (1997) Social Meanings of News: A Text-Reader, p. 123. , Berkowitz Dan, (ed), Thousand Oaks, Sage,,. ed., –38; Baron, D.P., Persistent Media Bias (2006) Journal of Public Economics, 90 (1-2), pp. 1-36; Benson, R., Blach-Orsten, M., Powers, M., Willig, I., Zambrano, S.V., Media Systems Online and Off: Comparing the Form of News in the United States, Denmark, and France (2012) Journal of Communication, 62 (1), pp. 21-38; Benson, R., Wood, T., Who Says What or Nothing at All?

This study questions the validity of those claims within the context of digital newspaper coverage, interrogating how topic and region shape coverage. Using a content analysis of coverage from sixteen newspapers in various U.S. market types and regions, this research examines framing and sourcing features in articles about protests. Results suggest media coverage of protests centered on racial issues (discrimination of Indigenous people and anti-Black racism) follows more of a delegitimizing pattern than stories about protests related to immigrants’ rights, health, and environment. A model to understand news coverage of protest based on a hierarchy of social struggle is proposed. © The Author(s) 2019.","digital journalism; media framing; media markets; protest paradigm; social movements",,,,,,,,,,"Alia, V., (2004) Media Ethics and Social Change, , New York, NY, Routledge;

It holds up to empirical scrutiny the claim that genuine press criticism can only occur within the bounds of political-elite debate. Taking the Australian government’s 2014 decision to fight the Islamic State as its case study, it explores areas of consensus and dissensus between political discourse and the media. Conducting a qualitative analysis of three media frames used by major newspapers, it tests the “indexing hypothesis” and concludes that some press coverage went beyond the parameters of political-elite debate.

I revisit the typology proposed by Pippa Norris, which distinguishes between premodern, modern, and postmodern campaigns. This typology, and others like it, homogenizes ground campaigns. Ground campaigns only feature by virtue of their centrality in premodern campaigns and their peripherality in modern and postmodern campaigns. I argue that the prominence of the rally varies across ground campaigns. By trivializing rallies, current typologies obscure this variation between African campaigns and between campaigns in sub-Saharan Africa and the rest of the world. To accommodate these differences, I propose a schema of campaign ecologies, adapted from Norris’ own, which incorporates a distinct ideal-type: the rally-intensive campaign. This revision internationalizes this hitherto Western-bound typology and may illuminate the features of campaigns in other middle- and low-income countries too. Equally, it throws into relief differences between historic premodern campaigns in Western countries. I contend that rally-intensiveness is a definitive feature of election campaigns from which other features stem. To illuminate such typical features, I study Tanzania, which has the most rally-intensive campaigns in Africa. I draw on ethnographic research and original survey data to identify the four following typical features of the rally-intensive campaign. Local as well as national leaders hold rallies frequently. Local rallies are better attended in aggregate than national ones, and accordingly, campaign contact is direct. Mass meetings dwarf the canvass as a means of campaign contact, and local party networks concentrate their efforts on “producing” rallies. © The Author(s) 2019.","Africa; election campaign; ground campaign; political communication; rally",,,,,,"Economic and Social Research Council, ESRC

This paper explores the various aspects of suspicion in the perceptions of journalists covering the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, drawing on twenty in-depth interviews with journalists and an interdisciplinary approach to the conceptualization of suspicion and (dis)trust. An inductive-qualitative analysis of journalists’ narratives identified three main aspects: suspicion of information sources, suspicion of peer journalists, and awareness of being under suspicion. The study demonstrates that through all stages of news production, journalists operate within a perpetual context of suspicion despite being required to generate trust. This dilemma culminates in hostile environments, where journalists must trust their sources in order to ensure their physical security yet are professionally required to epistemically suspect the information delivered by these same sources. Taken together, the manifestations of suspicion identified in this study provide an analytical framework for understanding (dis)trust within journalism and for further studying the processes through which these manifestations can contribute to public trust in both the media and conflict parties. © The Author(s) 2019.","journalists; media & conflict; news production; suspicion; trust & distrust",,,,,,,,,,"Allan, S., Zelizer, B., Rules of engagement (2004) Reporting War: Journalism in Wartime, p. 115. , Allan Stuart, Zelizer Barbie, (eds), Abingdon, Routledge,,. ed., –33; Alon, I., Bar-Tal, D., (2016) The Role of Trust in Conflict Resolution, , Cham, Springer; Bar-Tal, D., Halperin, E., Socio-psychological barriers to conflict Resolution (2011) Intergroup Conflicts and Their Resolution: A Social Psychological Perspective, p. 217. , Bar-Tal Daniel, (ed), London, Psychology Press,,. ed., –40; Bar-Tal, D., Halperin, E., Oren, N., Socio–Psychological Barriers to Peace Making: The Case of the Israeli Jewish Society (2010) Social Issues and Policy Review, 4 (1), pp. 63-109; Blöbaum, B., (2014) Trust and Journalism in a Digital Environment, , https://ora.ox.ac.uk/objects/uuid:1db59385-cdf4-4c00-8373-a940629922a1, Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism (RISJ) Working Papers; Brandtzaeg, P.B., Lüders, M., Spangenberg, J., Rath-Wiggins, L., Følstad, A., Emerging Journalistic Verification Practices Concerning Social Media (2016) Journalism Practice, 10 (3), p. 323. , (,):, –42; Brants, K., De Vreese, C., Möller, J., van Praag, P., The Real Spiral of Cynicism?

The constellation of organizations, groups, and individuals contributing information to national and international news flows has changed as a result of the digital transformation. The “hybrid media system” has proven to be one of the most instructive concepts addressing this change. Its focus on the mutually dependent interconnections between various types of media organizations, actors, and publics has inspired prolific research. Yet the concept can tempt researchers to sidestep systematic analyses of information flows and actors’ differing degrees of influence by treating media systems as a black box. To enable large-scale, empirical comparative studies aimed at identifying interdependencies and power relationships in contemporary media systems, we propose the concept of discursive power. This describes the ability of contributors to communication spaces to introduce, amplify, and maintain topics, frames, and speakers, thus shaping public discourses and controversies that unfold in interconnected communication spaces. We also provide a theoretical framework of how structural features of organizations and media systems contribute to the emergence of discursive power for different types of actors in various contexts. This adds to the theoretical toolkit available to researchers interested in the empirical analysis of contemporary media systems. © The Author(s) 2019.","agenda setting; comparative research; discursive power; framing; hybrid media system; media systems; theoretical framework",,,,,,"Volkswagen Foundation","We thank Scott Cooper, Valeska Gerstung, Ralph Schroeder, Yannis Theocharis, and three anonymous reviewers for their valuable feedback.

It has been argued that aggressions against journalists generate a deterrence effect on the watchdog role of the press. However, evidence of the press remaining critical in hostile environments appears to defy this claim. In this paper, I explore the relationship between violent government repression and the critical function of the press. Using an original data set of local Mexican newspapers from 2011 to 2013, I examine the direct effects of violence on front-page headlines. I find that while repression does deter critical coverage, the ultimate effect is contingent upon the configuration of strategic press allies in the locality, reviewed here as nongovernmental organizations, opposition parties, and newspaper publishers. © The Author(s) 2019.","authoritarianism; civil society; freedom of the press; Latin America; media scandals; repression; violence",,,,,,,,,,"Adserá, A., Boix, C., Payne, M., Are You Being Served?

It is the most extensive study of such measurements outside the United States and one of very few to include expert judgments. We find that citizen perceptions and expert judgments are heavily affected by partisan bias. We show how these biases can be eliminated with a regression-based procedure. After such adjustment, seven of the eight resulting measures of parties’ campaign tone (five based on newspapers, one on citizen perceptions, and one on expert judgments) are strongly correlated. The eighth measure (based on one of the newspapers) depicts the tone of parties’ campaigns very differently owing to different criteria of what to cover in a campaign. Each of the three kinds of empirical information is adequate as a basis for measuring parties’ campaign tone, but adjustment for partisan biases is essential for perception and judgment data. Common apprehensions about the “subjectivity” of citizen perceptions are not justified, while expert judgments are equally useful, as long as sufficient information is available to eliminate their partisan bias. © The Author(s) 2019.","bias correction; citizen perceptions; convergent validity; expert survey; measurement; negative campaigning; newspaper campaign coverage; partisan bias",,,,,,,,,,"Abbe, O.G., Herrnson, P.S., Magelby, D.B., Patterson, K.D., Are Professional Campaigns More Negative?

The aim of this paper is therefore to provide the most comprehensive study of which political preferences (ideological leaning, party support, and political interest) have driven selective exposure to public service news over thirty years, covering the transition from a low-choice to a high-choice media environment. Using an annual representative survey conducted from 1986 to 2015 in Sweden (n = 103,589), results suggest that (1) the ideological left and right have used public service news to the same extent over time and that (2) support for parties outside (rather than inside) parliament accounts for a large decline in public service news use over time. But most importantly, (3) those who lack political interest show the largest decline in public service news use, while public service news use has remained more stable among politically interested citizens. © The Author(s) 2019.","audience fragmentation; echo chambers; ideological asymmetry; longitudinal analysis; partisan news; political ideology; political polarization; public service broadcasting (PSB); selective exposure",,,,,,,,,,"Aalberg, T., Curran, J., (2012) How Media Inform Democracy: A Comparative Approach, , New York, Routledge, eds; Arceneaux, K., Johnson, M., (2013) Changing Minds or Changing Channels?

We have a very limited sense for what drives this aggregate-level responsiveness, however. One possibility is that individuals learn at least part of what they need to know from mass media. Work tends to emphasize failures in both media coverage and citizens, but little research explores the prevalence of relevant, accurate information in media content, or citizens’ abilities to identify and respond to that information. Using the case of defense spending in the United States, we examine both, through an automated content analysis of thirty-five years of reporting, validated by a coding exercise fielded to survey respondents. Results prompt analyses of the American National Election Study (ANES), tracing both individual-level perceptions of and preferences for defense spending change over time. These results, supplemented by aggregate analyses of the General Social Survey (GSS), illustrate how media might facilitate—but also confuse—public responsiveness. © The Author(s) 2019.","mass media; negative feedback; public opinion; public policy; thermostatic responsiveness",,,,,,"Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI

Using an exhaustive measure of political learning, and thanks to the use of panel data, it shows that at least some of the otherwise “inattentive citizens” were able to learn about politics during the Spanish general election campaign in December 2015. This group predominantly comprised women, the poorly educated, and especially those with low motivation. From all the media outlets analyzed here, we conclude that it was the information disseminated on TV infotainment that was most successful in promoting learning. Significantly, TV infotainment contributed the most to learning facts about the new political parties entering the electoral competition. © The Author(s) 2019.","election campaigns; infotainment; knowledge gaps; learning; Spain",,,,,,"Ministerio de Ciencia e InnovaciÃ³n, MICINN: CSO2012-32009, CSO2016-75090-R","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: We acknowledge the financial support of the Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation (Grant Numbers CSO2012-32009 and CSO2016-75090-R]).",,,"Aalberg, T., Blekesaune, A., Elvestad, E., Media Choice and Informed Democracy: Toward Increasing News Consumption Gaps in Europe?

Immigration featured high on the Brexit news agenda and EU citizens’ rights to work and live in the United Kingdom are likely to be affected by the country’s exit from the EU. This study analyzes how salient EU citizens were in Brexit news, and investigates whether there was a relationship between the negative portrayal of EU citizens and the type of news outlet. The analysis is based on 19,367 news stories published between June 1, 2015, and June 23, 2016. Automated content analysis was used to determine whether EU citizens were mentioned. The results do not reveal a divide between tabloids and broadsheets, but between national and regional papers. It is only in regional papers from England and Wales that EU citizens were more likely to be mentioned if the tone of a news story was more negative. The findings also suggest that the news media presented the Brexit referendum as a vote about migration in general rather than about intra-EU migration. © The Author(s) 2019.","automated text analysis; Brexit; EU citizens; local news; negativity; news reporting; popular press",,,,,,,,,,"Allen, W.L., A Decade of Immigration in the British Press (2016) Migration Observatory Report, , November, 1–34; Allern, S., (2001) Nyhetsverdier: Om Markedsorientering Og Journalistikk I Ti Norske Aviser (News values: On market orientation and news reporting in ten Norwegian newspapers), , Kristiansand: IJ-Forlaget, [,]; Alpers, G.W., Winzelberg, A.J., Classen, C., Roberts, H., Dev, P., Koopman, C., Taylor, C.B., Evaluation of Computerized Text Analysis in an Internet Breast Cancer Support Group (2005) Computers in Human Behavior, 21 (2). , (,): 361–76; Balabanova, E., Balch, A., Sending and Receiving: The Ethical Framing of Intra-Eu Migration in the European Press (2010) European Journal of Communication, 25 (4). , (,): 382–97; Bennett, S., New ‘Crises,’ Old Habits: Online Interdiscursivity and Intertextuality in UK Migration Policy Discourses (2018) Journal of Immigrant and Refugee Studies, 16 (1-2). , (,): 140–60; Benoit, K., Watanabe, K., Nulty, P., Obeng, A., Wang, H., Lauderdale, B., Lowe, W., (2017) Quanteda: Quantitative Analysis of Textual Data, , http://Quanteda.Io, R Package Version: 0.99; Bentele, G., Fähnrich, B., Personalization as a Social Mechanism in Media and Social Organizations (2010) Personalisierung der Organisationskommunikation: Theoretische Zugänge, Empirie und Praxis (Personalization of Organizational Communication: Theoretical Approaches, Empirics, and Practice), pp. 51-75. , Eisenegger M., Wehmeier S., (eds), Wiesbaden, VS Verlag für Sozialwissenschaften,, [,].

Consequently, media coverage has a hybrid character consisting of elements ascribed to both a normative and a commercial media logic. Therefore, analyzing the prevalence of single elements in media coverage reveals only part of the story. Taking nine wage disputes in Germany between 2003 and 2015 as prominent instances of nonviolent conflicts, we aim at revealing the structure of news coverage (n = 1,181). A cluster analysis unfolded four distinct patterns of conflict coverage. The results indicated that the ideal-type dichotomy between a commercial and a normative media logic is more differentiated: Emotionalization and human interest framing separated patterns into some, which were more aligned to a commercial logic, and others, which were more characteristic for a normative logic. However, negativity, background information, and a hard-facts-first structure played a multifold role with the highest amount of background information being accompanied by the highest levels of negativity. Furthermore, conflict phase (strike vs. bargaining phase), conflict type (low vs. high potential impact on society), and media outlets’ genre (quality vs. tabloid vs. news agency) were identified as antecedents of the coverage patterns. © The Author(s) 2019.","commercial media logic; conflicts; media coverage patterns; normative media logic; structure of media content",,,,,,,"The authors disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was funded by the Otto Brenner Foundation in Germany.",,,"Aalberg, T., Strömbeck, J., de Vreese, C., The Framing of Politics as Strategy and Game: A Review of Concepts, Operationalizations and Key Findings (2011) Journalism, 13 (2). , (,): 162–78; Bispinck, R., (2007) Wages, collective bargaining and industrial relations in Germany 1995-2005”Löhne, Tarifverhandlungen und Tarifsystem in Deutschland 1995-2005, , [,].

This article analyzes the various ways in which the media choose to deal with RWPPs in the Benelux region (i.e., Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg). Using evidence from interviews with media practitioners (n = 46), the findings suggest that in the absence of a credible right-wing populist challenger, media practitioners in Luxembourg and Wallonia adhere to strict demarcation, whereas the Dutch and Flemish media have become gradually more accommodative to RWPPs. This study makes two contributions to the field. First, it systematically theorizes the different ways in which the media can approach the populist radical right. Second, it provides illustrative, comparative evidence about the rationale for why some media provide space for RWPPs while others deny it, thereby illuminating the under-researched topic of societal responses to the populist radical right. © The Author(s) 2018.","Benelux; cordon sanitaire; media; populism; radical right",,,,,,,,,,"Aalberg, T., de Vreese, C., Introduction: Comprehending Populist Political Communication (2017) Populist Political Communication in Europe, pp. 3-11. , Aalberg Toril, Esser Frank, Reinemann Carsten, Strömbäck Jesper, de Vreese Claes, (eds), New York, Routledge,,. ed; Akkerman, T., Netherlands Election Preview: Will Geert Wilders Follow Trump and Win Power?

We analyze the content and style of 2,517 statements from 103 politicians from six countries (France, Italy, Germany, Switzerland, United Kingdom, and United States) who differ in their party affiliation (populist versus nonpopulist) and hierarchical position (backbencher vs. frontbencher). To learn more about their media strategies and chances of success, we investigate four communication channels (Facebook, Twitter, talk shows, and news media) that systematically differ in their degree of journalistic intervention and examine fourteen often-raised topics that differ in their suitability for populist mobilization. Our content analysis shows the highest probability of populist communication comes from (1) members of populist parties and (2) backbenchers who address (3) mobilizable issues in (4) social media or newspaper articles.

We use online survey data to examine the relationships among political social networks, internal political efficacy, and social media news engagement in six countries (Taiwan, Japan, Korea, Hong Kong, Malaysia, and Singapore). Findings across the samples showed that individuals in political social networks comprising cross-cutting and like-minded political views engage in social media news more, and internal political efficacy accentuated the relationships between cross-cutting/like-minded political social networks and engagement. Implications for the findings are discussed in relation to current debates on the potential for social media news engagement to engender a more deliberative democracy; or lead to greater ideological segregation and echo chambers in social media spaces. © The Author(s) 2018.","Asia; cross-cutting networks; deliberative democracy; echo chambers; political efficacy; social media news",,,,,,,,,,"Abbott, J., Introduction: Assessing the Social and Political Impact of the Internet and New Social Media in Asia (2013) Journal of Contemporary Asia, 43 (4). , (,): 579–90; Bakshy, E., Messing, S., Adamic, L., Exposure to Ideologically Diverse News and Opinion on Facebook (2015) Science, 348. , 1130–32; Bandura, A., Social Cognitive Theory of Mass Communication (2001) Media Psychology, 3 (3). , (,): 265–99; Barberá, P., Jost Jonathan Nagler, J.T., Tucker, J.A., Bonneau, R., Tweeting from Left to Right: Is Online Political Communication more than an Echo Chamber?

This paper analyzes whether citizens with a populist worldview also hold negative attitudes toward the media. From a theoretical point of view, the paper shows that both the anti-elite, anti-outgroup and people centrism dimension of populism contradicts the normative expectations toward the media. For instance, the assumption of a homogeneous people and the exclusion of a societal outgroup is incompatible with a pluralistic media coverage. The results of a representative survey in Germany predominantly confirmed a relation between a populist worldview and negative media attitudes. However, the three populism dimensions influenced the evaluations not in a consistent way. A systematic relation could only be found for antielite populism, which is negatively associated with all analyzed media evaluations such as media trust or satisfaction with the media’s performance. This indicates that in a populist worldview, the media are perceived as part of a detached elite that neglects the citizens’ interests. However, the results confirm the assumption of a natural ally between populism and tabloid or commercial media. Individuals with people centrist and anti-outgroup attitudes have higher trust in these media outlets. © The Author(s) 2018.","media bias; media trust; political attitudes; political perceptions; populist worldview; Western Europe",,,,,,,"The author disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/ or publication of this article: This research project was funded by Ludwig-Maximilians-University Munich’s Institutional Strategy LMUexcellent within the framework of the German Excellence Initiative.",,,"Aalberg, T., Esser, F., Reinemann, C., Strömbäck, J., de Vreese, C.H., (2017) Populist Political Communication in Europe, , New York, Routledge, eds; Akkerman, A., Mudde, C., Zaslove, A., How Populist Are the People?

We use an original dataset of statements made by political actors during eighteen electoral campaigns in nine European countries. Our multinomial logit model suggests that increasing disproportionality slightly increases negativity, while thanks to parties competing on the same market, less polarized electorates invite more negative political campaigns. Finally, we find a U-shaped relationship between party system fragmentation and negativity: Increasing the number of parties, negativity decreases first, only to start increasing again once the party system becomes very fragmented. We explain this with parties altering their coalition strategies with the changing number of parties: Less fragmentation makes it more likely to having to step into coalition with the competitors, thus decreasing negativity, while in very fragmented systems, parties not needed to any potential coalitions become easy targets to negative campaign. © The Author(s) 2018.","campaign advertising; comparative research; negativity; newspapers; political advertising",,,,,,"Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG: DE 1667/4-1

This study extends the boundary conditions of existing literature by studying the factors affecting media choice in the Islamic Republic of Iran, a drastically understudied context. Within the overarching framework of motivated reasoning, we propose two theoretically relevant factors that should drive selective exposure into regime media or non-regime alternatives in authoritarian contexts: (1) system-justifying attitudes and (2) regime-sanctioned identities, here religiosity. Relying on two different surveys conducted within Iran in 2012 and 2016, we find that religiosity strongly predicts the reliance on non-regime media in both studies, whereas system-justifying attitudes predict selectivity in Study 2.

With the rise of social network services as central spaces for encountering news, there is a need to move beyond the notion of consumer demand (measured by attention to news stories) to a broader conception of user engagement (encompassing attention as well as social interactions online). This article seeks to remedy this by analyzing which parts of election coverage tend to become popular and go viral. It develops a concept of user agendas that include popularity (news stories that receive most clicks on news Web sites) and virality (stories that users share most intensively on social network sites). The article then applies the concepts in a case study of online news coverage during the 2015 Danish parliamentary election. Through an analysis of frames, sentiments, and actors, it is shown that game-strategic and personalized coverage tend to attract large-scale attention on news Web sites, whereas issue-oriented coverage fares better on social network sites. This suggests that what users demand depend on where they encounter news. Users tend to engage with one kind of news in private settings and another in the public settings on the social Internet. © The Author(s) 2018.","game-strategy; meta-frame; personalization; popularity; sentiment; virality; Web scraping",,,,,,"Childhood Cancer Canada, CCC

To answer these questions, we rely on a quantitative content analysis of newspaper articles and party press releases in seven countries (Austria, France, Germany, Greece, the Netherlands, Portugal, and the United Kingdom) during the twelve weeks prior to the 2014 European Parliament (EP) election. Our results from a daily-level vector autoregression (VAR) analysis show that parties are the main driver. However, our findings also indicate that single approaches in comparative research, namely, issue salience, party polarization, and media characteristics, cannot fully explain cross-national variations, which stem from combinations of different determinants, such as low (high) EU issue salience interacting with high (low) party polarization. © The Author(s) 2018.","agenda-setting; comparative research; election campaign; newspapers; political parties; Western Europe",,,,,,"Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur FÃ¶rderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung, SNSF: 100017E-144592/1

The 2016 U.S. presidential election was an event of intense international interest, both for its internal drama, but also for the policy positions of both of the major candidates. This paper presents a comparative analysis of how media in four key regions covered the U.S. presidential election and its immediate aftermath. Researchers utilized an innovative technology that allowed the teams to harvest media content, from almost seventy-five global news sources, in Arabic, Farsi, Chinese, and Russian. This paper utilized the theoretical construct of strategic narratives to demonstrate how the U.S. election is incorporated into narrative constructions of global order. Theoretically, this project seeks to deepen our understanding, from a comparative methodology, of how “events,” such as the U.S. presidential election, provide the raw material for global contestations of the global order. The essay also provides a mechanism for analyzing and evaluating these narratives using Fisher’s narrative paradigm. Finally, the paper demonstrates an innovative methodological approach to comparative analysis from disparate cultural and news traditions, languages, and patterns of access to media. © The Author(s) 2018.","China; elections; Iran; Russia; strategic narratives",,,,,,,,,,"Aalberg, T., Papathanassopoulos, S., Soroka, S., Curran, J., Hayashi, K., Iyengar, S., Jones, P.K., Tiffen, R., International TV News, Foreign Affairs Interest, and Public Knowledge: A Comparative Study of Foreign News Coverage and Public Opinion in 11 Countries (2013) Journalism Studies, 14 (3), pp. 387-406; Arsenault, A., Hong, S.-H., Price, M., Strategic Narratives of the Arab Spring and After (2017) Forging the World: Strategic Narratives and International Relations, pp. 190-217. , Miskimmon Alister, O’Loughlin Ben, Roselle Laura, (eds), Ann Arbor, University of Michigan Press,,. ed; Roland, B., (1957) 1972.

In-depth studies additionally suggest gender or occupational characteristics such as risky newsbeats increase the likelihood of being threatened. We overcome data limitations in many of these studies by analyzing work-related threats reported by journalists in Mexico, a territorially uneven democracy. Findings confirm that contexts of criminal insecurity are the strongest predictor of threats but only for journalists who are frequently harassed. For the infrequently threatened, democratic normative commitments are a stronger predictor. Subnational government corruption is another important predictor of threat but operates counter to expectations. We believe this is because clientelism sufficiently controls journalists without the need for threat. Neither occupational traits nor gender were individually important predictors. Findings suggest future research should compare threat and harassment across lower and higher risk contexts, and measure public insecurity and clientelism at the local level where journalists actually work. Measurement improvements might better reveal the gender dynamics of threat. More broadly, comparative research and policy-making in democracies and authoritarian hybrids should focus on how local authoritarians limit journalists’ democratic normative aspirations. © The Author(s) 2018.","democracy; harassment; journalism; Mexico; normative roles; occupational risk; subnationalism",,,,,,"University of Miami","The authors disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: University of Miami Provost’s Research Award and School of Communication Research Award; the Universidad Iberoamericana-Mexico City Young Scholars Grant; Worlds of Journalism Study Central Funding and Ludwig-Maximilians University of Munich.",,,"Adams, C., ‘They Go for Gender First’: The Nature and Effect of Sexist Abuse of Female Technology Journalists (2017) Journalism Practice, , Published electronically August 9; Aguilar, F.V., Jr., Mendoza, M.P., Candelaria, A.L.K., Keeping the State at Bay: The Killing of Journalists in the Philippines, 1998-2012 (2014) Critical Asian Studies, 46 (4). , (,): 649–77; (2016) FEAR.

The present study explores the effects of the different components of right-wing populist communication—anti-immigrant messages, populist content, and populist style—on attitudes toward immigrants. By combining a media content analysis (N = 605 articles) with a panel survey (N = 1,968) in metropolitan areas of four Western European countries (France, Germany, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom), this study analyzes how citizens’ attitudes toward immigrants are influenced by the right-wing populist communication with which they are confronted in their individual media diet. The results show that anti-immigrant statements in the media lead to more negative cognitions toward immigrants, while populist content leads to more negative emotions. The study, thus, demonstrates that not only anti-immigrant rhetoric but also populism as a thin-centered ideology influence citizens’ attitudes toward immigrants on top of pre-existing attitudes. © The Author(s) 2018.","cognitions; emotions; linkage analysis; media effects; panel survey; populism",,,,,,"Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur FÃ¶rderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung, SNSF","The authors disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This research was funded by the Swiss National Science Foundation.",,,"Aalberg, T., Esser, F., Reinemann, C., Stromback, J., Vreese, C.H., (2016) Populist Political Communication in Europe, , New York, Routledge; Abelson, R.P., Kinder, D.R., Peters, M.D., Fiske, S.T., Affective and semantic components in political person perception (1982) Journal of personality and social psychology, 42 (4), pp. 619-630; Albertazzi, D., McDonnell, D., (2008) Twenty-First Century Populism: The Spectre of Western European Democracy, , Basingstoke, Palgrave Macmillan; Andersen, K., de Vreese, C.H., Albæk, E., Measuring media diet in a high-choice environment-Testing the list-frequency technique (2016) Communication Methods and Measures, 10 (2-3), pp. 81-98; Arendt, F., Marquart, F., Matthes, J., Effects of right-wing populist political advertising on implicit and explicit stereotypes (2015) Journal of Media Psychology, 27 (4), pp. 178-189; Arzheimer, K., The AfD: Finally a Successful Right-Wing Populist Eurosceptic Party for Germany?

By integrating both a communication-centered and an actor-centered approach to the study of populism, we tackle four major research questions: Do populist and non-populist leaders adopt similar communication strategies on Facebook? Is there any evidence of the so-called populist zeitgeist in such arena? What different combinations between the so-called three “elements of populist communication” characterize the communication strategies of political leaders on Facebook? Are there major differences between Western and Latin American leaders? The results of our analysis provide an important contribution to the existing literature on populism and political communication in different respects. First, the populist zeitgeist “thesis” does not apply to the communication strategies of political leaders on Facebook. Second, the spread of elements of populist communication in Latin America is considerably lower in comparison with Western countries, irrespective of party ideological background. Finally, this paper identifies all the logical combinations that can occur between the interplay of the different elements of populist communication, thus enabling the classification of the communication strategies employed by political leaders on Facebook. © The Author(s) 2018.","ideology; Internet; Latin America; political parties; United States; Western Europe",,,,,,,,,,"Aalberg, T., de Vreese, C.H., Introduction: Comprehending Populist Political Communication (2017) Populist Political Communication in Europe, pp. 3-11. , Aalberg Toril, Esser Frank, Reinemann Carsten, Strömbäck Jesper, de Vreese Claes H., (eds), New York, Routledge,,. ed; Aalberg, T., Esser, F., Reinemann, C., Strömbäck, J., de Vreese, C.H., (2017) Populist Political Communication in Europe, , New York, Routledge, eds; Akkerman, T., Hagelund, A., ‘Women and Children First!’ Anti-immigration Parties and Gender in Norway and the Netherlands (2007) Patterns of Prejudice, 41 (2), pp. 197-214; Albertazzi, D., McDonnell, D., The Sceptre and the Spectre (2008) Twenty-First Century Populism: The Spectre of Western European Democracy, pp. 1-11. , Albertazzi Daniele, McDonnell Duncan, (eds), New York, Palgrave,,. ed; Bale, T., Green-Pedersen, C., Krouwel, A., Luther, R.K., Sitter, N., If You Can’t Beat Them, Join Them?

First, previous research has neglected the differential effects of populist communication on the Left and Right. Second, internationally comparative studies are missing. Finally, previous research mostly studied attitudinal outcomes, neglecting behavioral effects. To address these key issues, this paper draws on a unique, extensive, and comparative experiment in sixteen European countries (N = 15,412) to test the effects of populist communication on political engagement. The findings show that anti-elitist populism has the strongest mobilizing effects, and anti-immigrant messages have the strongest demobilizing effects. Moreover, national conditions such as the level of unemployment and the electoral success of the populist Left and Right condition the impact of populist communication. These findings provide important insights into the persuasiveness of populist messages spread throughout the European continent. © The Author(s) 2018.","experimental research; internationally comparative research; political engagement; populism; populist communication; social identity framing",,,,,,"Norges Teknisk-Naturvitenskapelige Universitet, NTNU

We adopted an original research design intending Facebook as a natural environment where investigating the interaction between social media users and populist and non-populist parties. Our case selection considers three countries falling into the pluralist polarized media system: France, Italy, and Spain. A human content analysis was carried out on a sample of 2,235 Facebook posts published during thirty days in 2016 by the four main parties/leaders in each country. An original algorithm allowed to identify the gender of users liking each message. We tested whether men tend more to provide likes to messages posted by populist parties, messages published by radical populists, messages containing populist contents, and different components of populist messages. Findings confirm the existence of a gender-oriented reaction to populism: Men tend to support populist actors and parties on Facebook more than women do, by providing likes to their content. Yet the difference in gender gap between radical and moderate parties is not significant. We also found that the antielite component of populist discourse obtains more likes by male Facebook users. This pattern is common for both populist and non-populist parties. © The Author(s) 2018.","digital engagement; gender gap; Mediterranean model; populism; social media",,,,,,,,,,"Aalberg, T., Esser, F., Reinemann, C., Strömbäck, J., de Vreese, C.H., (2017) Populist Political Communication in Europe, , New York, Routledge; Abi-Hassan, S., Populism and Gender (2017) The Oxford Handbook of Populism, , Rovira Kaltwasser Cristóbal, Taggart Paul, Ochoa Espejo Paulina, Ostiguy Pierre, (eds), Oxford, Oxford University Press,,. ed., 426–44; Albertazzi, D., McDonnell, D., (2015) Populists in Power, , London, Routledge; Aslanidis, P., Is populism an ideology?

We identify three roles—as gatekeepers, interpreters, and initiators—the media can assume in their coverage of populist actors, populist ideology, and populist communication. A comparative content analysis of nine thousand stories from fifty-nine news outlets in ten European countries shows that both media factors (e.g., tabloid orientation) and political factors (e.g., response of mainstream parties) influence the extent and nature of populism in the media. Although newspapers in most countries do not overrepresent populist actors and tend to evaluate them negatively, we still find abundant populist content in the news. Several media outlets like to present themselves as mouthpieces of the people while, at the same time, cover politicians and parties with antiinstitutional undertones. © The Author(s) 2018.","comparative research; journalism; news reporting; political parties",,,,,,"Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur FÃ¶rderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung, SNSF

Guided by the hierarchy of influences model, we analyzed answers from 1,543 journalists, journalism educators, and journalism students in the region. We identified both single and multilevel constraints impeding investigative reporting in Latin America. Single-level influences are those that are better analyzed by focusing on one level of the hierarchical model. These included individual (lack of training), routine (relationships with sources), organizational (media ownership), and institutional influences (censorship). However, results also suggest there are certain types of influences that are better suited for analysis combining all levels. Despite two decades of media liberalization, crime and corruption, state violence against the press, and the lack of a free-speech culture cut across all layers, posing severe constraints to investigative reporting in Latin America. © The Author(s) 2018.","democracy; hierarchy of influences; investigative journalism; Latin America",,,,,,,,,,"Abdenour, J., Inspecting the Investigators: An Analysis of Television Investigative Journalism and Factors Leading to Its Production (2017) Journalism & Mass Communication Quarterly, , https://doi.org/10.1177/1077699017733438, First Published September 28, 2017; (2016) Standard Definitions.

Using a framework that characterizes journalists’ Twitter behavior in terms of the dimensions of their peer-to-peer relationships and a comprehensive sample of permanently credentialed journalists for the U.S. Congress, substantial evidence of gender bias beyond existing inequities emerges. Most alarming is that male journalists amplify and engage male peers almost exclusively, while female journalists tend to engage most with each other. The significant support for claims of gender asymmetry as well as evidence of gender silos are findings that not only underscore the importance of further research but also suggest overarching consequences for the structure of contemporary political communication. © The Author(s) 2018.","beltway journalism; gender; political journalism; Twitter; Washington journalism; women in journalism",,,,,,,,,,"Adams, C., ‘They Go for Gender First’: The Nature and Effect of Sexist Abuse of Female Technology Journalists (2017) Journalism Practice, , Published electronically August 9; Allsop, J., Ho, K.K., Global Media Confronts Its Own Weinsteins (2017) Columbia Journalism Review, , https://www.cjr.org/watchdog/media-weinstein-sexual-harassment-global.php; Armstrong, C.L., The Influence of Reporter Gender on Source Selection in Newspaper Stories (2004) Journalism & Mass Communciation Quarterly, 81 (1), pp. 139-154; Armstrong, C.L., Gao, F., Gender, Twitter and News Content: An Examination Across Platforms and Coverage Areas (2011) Journalism Studies, 12 (4), pp. 490-505; Artwick, C., News Sourcing and Gender on Twitter (2014) Journalism, 15 (8). , (,): 1111–27; Bakshy, E., Hoffman, J., Mason, W., Watts, D., (2011) Identifying Influencers on Twitter, , Fourth ACM International Conference on Web Search and Data Mining, Hong Kong; Barnard, S., ‘Tweet or Be Sacked’: Twitter and the New Elements of Journalistic Practice (2014) Journalism, 17 (2), pp. 190-207; Brems, C., Temmerman, M., Graham, T., Broersma, M., Personal Branding on Twitter: How Employed and Freelance Journalists Stage Themselves on Social Media (2017) Digital Journalism, 5 (4). , (,): 443–59; Carlson, M., (2017) Journalistic Authority: Legitimating News in the Digital Era, , New York, Columbia University Press; Cha, M., Haddadi, H., Benevenuto, F., Gummadi, K.P., (2010) Measuring User Influence in Twitter: The Million Follower Fallacy, , The Fourth International AAI Conference on Weblogs and Social Media, Washington DC, USA; Clayman, S., Elliott, M., Heritage, J., Beckett, M., The President’s Questioners: Consequential Attributes of the White House Press Corps (2012) The International Journal of Press/Politics, 17 (1). , (,): 100–21; (2016), https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/browse/collection.action?collectionCode=CDIR&browsePath=114%2F2016-02-12%2FR1&isCollapsed=false&leafLevelBrowse=false&isDocumentResults=true&ycord=169; Cook, T., The News Media as a Political Institution: Looking Backward and Looking Forward (2006) Political Communication, 23 (2). , (,): 159–71; Cozma, R., Chen, K.-J., What’s in a Tweet?

The research draws on a content analysis of a total of fifty-one news organizations in Sweden, France, and the United States, representing, respectively, Hallin and Mancini’s democratic corporatist, polarized pluralist, and liberal models. We find that two types of institutional logics—affordance and homogenization—shape the amount and type of public-service-oriented news. On average, public-service-oriented news was highest at civil-society-owned media, but there was significant variation within this category: We call this kind of institutional logic an affordance logic because it affords but does not guarantee a certain kind of news content. Public media, on the other hand, exhibited the least deviation across outlets within each country, thus exemplifying a strong homogenization logic. All forms of ownership, but especially privately held and civil society media, exhibited significant variations across individual organizations.

Based on custom built online surveys conducted between 2015 and 2016 on samples representative of the adult population with internet access in each country, we test hypotheses on both intra-country and cross-country direct and differential effects of political dual screening on various forms of offline and online political participation. We find a positive correlation between the frequency with which citizens dual screen political content and their overall levels of participation. Such correlation is stronger among respondents with lower levels of interest in politics, suggesting that dual screening has the potential to bridge participatory gaps between citizens who are more and less politically involved. The relationship between dual screening and participation is also significantly stronger in countries whose media systems feature the strongest Public Service Broadcasters. Our findings suggest that dual screening makes a positive contribution to democratic citizenship and political equality, and that it can also help public service media fulfill some of their key functions. © The Author(s) 2018.","comparative politics; dual screening; political participation; Public Service Broadcasting; social media; television news",,,,,,,"The authors disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: The research presented in this article was funded by the Italian Ministry of Education and Research under the “Future in Research”Initiative, 2013-2016 (project code RBFR12BKZH).",,,"Aarts, K., Semetko, H.A., The Divided Electorate: Media Use and Political Involvement (2003) Journal of Politics, 65 (3). , (,): 759–84; Anstead, N., Chadwick, A., Parties, Election Campaigning, and the Internet toward a Comparative Institutional Approach (2008) The Routledge Handbook of Internet Politics, , Chadwick Andrew, Howard Philip N., (eds), Abingdon, Routledge,,. ed; Anstead, N., O’Loughlin, B., The Emerging Viewertariat and BBC Question Time: Television Debate and Real-Time Commenting Online (2011) International Journal of Press/Politics, 16 (4). , (,): 440–62; Auverset, L.A., Billings, A.C., Relationships between Social TV and Enjoyment: A Content Analysis of The Walking Dead’s Story Sync Experience (2016) Social Media + Society, 2 (3). , (,): 1–12; Baker, R., Blumberg, S.J., Brick, J.M., Zahs, D., Research Synthesis AAPOR Report on Online Panels (2010) Public Opinion Quarterly, 74 (4). , (,): 711–81; Barnidge, M., Gil de Zúñiga, H., Diehl, T., Second Screening and Political Persuasion on Social Media (2017) Journal of Broadcasting & Electronic Media, 61 (2). , (,): 309–31; Barnidge, M., Diehl, T., Rojas, H., Second Screening for News and Digital Divides (2018) Social Science Computer Review; Barnidge, M., Rojas, H., Hostile Media Perceptions, Presumed Media Influence, and Political Talk: Expanding the Corrective Action Hypothesis (2014) International Journal of Public Opinion Research, 26 (2). , (,): 135–56; Bentivegna, S., Marchetti, R., Live Tweeting a Political Debate: The Case of the ‘Italia bene commune (2015) European Journal of Communication, 30 (6). , ’, (,): 631–47; Boulianne, S., Social Media Use and Participation: A Meta-Analysis of Current Research (2015) Information, Communication & Society, 18 (5). , (,): 524–38; Brüggemann, M., Engesser, S., Büchel, F., Humprecht, E., Castro, L., Hallin and Mancini Revisited: Four Empirical Types of Western Media Systems (2014) Journal of Communication, 64 (6). , (,): 1037–65; Bryan, M.L., Jenkins, S.P., Multilevel Modelling of Country Effects: A Cautionary Tale (2016) European Sociological Review, 32 (1), pp. 3-22; Cameron, J., Geidner, N., Something Old, Something New, Something Borrowed from Something Blue: Experiments on Dual Viewing TV and Twitter (2014) Journal of Broadcasting & Electronic Media, 58 (3). , (,): 400–19; Cantijoch, M., Cutts, D., Gibson, R., Moving Slowly up the Ladder of Political Engagement: A ‘Spill-Over’ Model of Internet Participation (2016) British Journal of Politics and International Relations, 18 (1), pp. 26-48; Chadwick, A., (2017) The Hybrid Media System: Politics and Power, , 2nd Edition., Oxford, Oxford University Press; Chadwick, A., O’Loughlin, B., Vaccari, C., Why People Dual-Screen Political Debates and Why It Matters for Democratic Engagement (2017) Journal of Broadcasting and Electronic Media, 61 (2). , (,): 220–39; Choi, B., Jung, Y., The Effects of Second-Screen Viewing and the Goal Congruency of Supplementary Content on User Perceptions (2016) Computers in Human Behavior, 64. , 347–54; Curran, J., Iyengar, S., Lund, A.B., Salovaara-Moring, I., Media System, Public Knowledge and Democracy: A Comparative Study (2009) European Journal of Communication, 24 (1), pp. 5-26; De Vreese, C.H., Boomgaarden, H., News, Political Knowledge and Participation: The Differential Effects of News Media Exposure on Political Knowledge and Participation (2006) Acta Politica, 41 (4). , (,): 317–41; Dobek-Ostrowska, B., Italianization (or Mediterraneanization) of the Polish Media System (2012) Comparing Media Systems beyond the Western World, , Hallin Daniel, Mancini Paolo, (eds), Oxford, Oxford University Press,,. ed., :, : 26–50; Eveland, W.P., The Effect of Political Discussion in Producing Informed Citizens: The Roles of Information, Motivation, and Elaboration (2004) Political Communication, 21 (2). , (,): 177–93; Fletcher, R., Nielsen, R.K., Are People Incidentally Exposed to News on Social Media?

Interactive broadcast media provides a valuable empirical lens for inquiring into why this may be case. The convergence of newer digital communication technologies with more established radio and television broadcasts is shifting opportunities for news media to affect citizen-state relations. These possibilities are pronounced on the African continent, where mobile telephony and increasingly plural media landscapes have given rise to popular and widespread interactive talk shows. The involvement of audience voices alters the nature of the media space where political communication happens. Through a comparative study of interactive shows in Zambia and Kenya, this article interrogates what audience participation means for the political nature and possibilities of the interactive radio and TV broadcast. Ict shows how the indeterminate audience is the basis for competing ideas about power, authority, and citizenship among the different participants in the show, including politicians, media professionals, and audience members. The power of the “audience-public,” brought into being through the interactive broadcast, it is argued, arises from in-between these participants in public discussion, who each invest in multiple and competing imaginaries of the elusive audience in pursuit of diverse ends. © The Author(s) 2018.","Africa; audiences; new technologies; public sphere; radio",,,,,,"Department for International Development, DFID: ES/J018945/1

While previous research compared the prominence of different types of political actors across national political contexts, this article situates its research in the context of European Union (EU) politics and, thereby, studies similar reference points across countries. Its focus lies on the European Commission and its members. Personalization is conceptualized as individualization and presidentialization, respectively. The article proposes that the EU integration process provides journalists with the opportunity to report more often about individual politicians, while political developments should further incentivize journalists to personalize their news from Brussels. To test this argument, the article investigates personalization patterns in seven broadsheets from Ireland, Britain, France, the Netherlands, Denmark, Italy, and Poland. In total, 119,070 articles are analyzed by automated content analysis over a period of twenty-five years. The article finds no pan-European trend toward greater personalization of politics with respect to news coverage of EU executive politics. The findings nonetheless provide important implications for future research. The article particularly discusses the universal applicability of the phenomenon, the time frame for analysis, and journalistic styles in covering European politics. © The Author(s) 2018.","automated content analysis; comparative research; European Union; personalization of politics; political journalism",,,,,,"Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek, NWO: 451-15-003

Leading scholarship argues that elites shape media content, especially in foreign affairs settings where journalists rely on official sources. But do media push back in domestic policy contexts? Focusing on immigration in Britain, we find press coverage exhibits signs of autonomy that rely on the state’s administrative branches. Our evidence comes from automated linguistic analysis of 190,000 items of migration coverage in nineteen national British newspapers from 2006 to 2015, and press releases published by the U.K. Home Office between 2010 and 2015. We show that the press increasingly portrayed immigration in terms of its scale. Then, by comparing the dynamics of a key government policy—lowering “net migration”—in press and Home Office rhetoric, we illustrate the limits of the government to insert its desired language into the press. Finally, we argue routine press interactions with the nonpolitical Office for National Statistics enabled coverage that diverged from politicians’ preferred lines. Our study contributes to press-state theory by providing evidence of media semiautonomy in a domestic policy arena, and highlighting the often-overlooked role of routine, bureaucratic procedure in supporting that autonomy. © 2018, © The Author(s) 2018.","bureaucracy; corpus linguistics; immigration; media independence; press-state relations",,,,,,"Economic and Social Research Council

Although it is true that paying taxes is a responsibility, it also entitles citizens to claim control over government spending, which may facilitate a greater democratization of a country’s political regime. Consistent with this reasoning, a growing body of scholarship has documented a positive relationship between the size of tax revenues extracted by the state and the adherence of the country’s regime to democratic values. What has been left underexplored is the role in this relationship of the media, a commonly available and relied-upon source of information about taxpaying for the public. This study offers a first contribution in this direction, by exploring the relationship between the nature of the political regime and the rhetorical construction of the concept of a taxpayer in the national press. Based on an automated content analysis of articles (N=24,969) published by ninety-two newspapers and news agencies in fifty-one countries using a set of pretrained and validated machine-learning algorithms, the study demonstrates that the less democratic a state is, the more likely it is for the national press to frame a taxpayer as a subordinate in a hierarchical relationship with the state, by discussing taxpaying in tax collection, rather than public spending, terms. The study furthers a more nuanced understanding of the place of the media in the taxation-democratization link and demonstrates the applicability of the supervised machine-learning approach to classifying frames in large cross-national samples of newspaper data. © 2018, © The Author(s) 2018.","computer-assisted text analysis; democratization; media framing; news; supervised machine learning; taxation",,,,,,,,,,"Alashri, S., Alzahrani, S., Tsai, J.-Y., Corman, S.R., Davulcu, H., ‘Climate Change’ Frames Detection and Categorization Based on Generalized Concepts (2016) International Journal of Semantic Computing, 10 (2). , 147–66; Bates, R.H., Lien, D.-H.D., A Note on Taxation, Development, and Representative Government (1985) Politics & Society, 14 (1), pp. 53-70; Boumans, J.W., Trilling, D., Taking Stock of the Toolkit: An Overview of Relevant Automated Content Analysis Approaches and Techniques for Digital Journalism Scholars (2016) Digital Journalism, 4 (1), pp. 8-23; Brasted, M., Framing Protest: The Chicago Tribune and the New York Times during the 1968 Democratic Convention (2005) Atlantic Journal of Communication, 13 (1), pp. 1-25; Burscher, B., Odijk, D., Vliegenthart, R., de Rijke, M., de Vreese, C.H., Teaching the Computer to Code Frames in News: Comparing Two Supervised Machine Learning Approaches to Frame Analysis (2014) Communication Methods and Measures, 8 (3), pp. 190-206; Burscher, B., Vliegenthart, R., de Vreese, C.H., Using Supervised Machine Learning to Code Policy Issues: Can Classifiers Generalize across Contexts?

Starting from the widespread but unrealistic ideal of the informed citizen, and its more realistic development through notions of the monitorial citizen, we analyze comprehensive qualitative data on news users’ experiences. We describe these news users as approximately informed, occasionally monitorial. This description emphasizes the limited, shifting, and partial figurations of societal information that citizens are able to obtain through their use of journalistic and social media, and thereby challenges normative ideals. How do monitorial ideals function when the citizens are only occasionally on guard? By zooming in on three key gaps between even a less demanding ideal and actual practices in news use, we underline the need to further reconceptualize our expectations of citizens’ news use. © 2018, © The Author(s) 2018.","citizens; democracy; democratic realism; media audiences; news; public sphere",,,,,,"Norges ForskningsrÃ¥d: 247617","The authors disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: The authors received financial support for the research and authorship of this article from the Research Council of Norway (Grant 247617).",,,"Aalberg, T., Blekesaune, A., Elvestad, E., Media Choice and Informed Democracy: Toward Increasing News Consumption Gaps in Europe?

This paper suggests the problem is better understood as an epistemological imbalance. We suggest that one epistemology—we call it “universalism”—underpins much comparative scholarship. While this approach produces numerous comparative insights, it also struggles to adequately account for the diversity of contexts it studies. We therefore describe an alternative epistemology, which we term “contextualism.” This approach aims to identify the mechanisms or principles that unify or differentiate cases across contexts. We suggest that progress in the field depends in part on the coexistence of multiple epistemologies, each with careful awareness of its strengths and limitations. © 2018, © The Author(s) 2018.","comparative research; global news; journalism; press systems",,,,,,,,,,"Aalberg, T., van Aelst, P., Curran, J., Media Systems and the Political Information Environment: A Cross-National Comparison (2010) International Journal of Press/Politics, 15 (3). , 255–71; Albæk, E., van Dalen, A., Jebril, N., de Vreese, C., (2014) Political Journalism in Comparative Perspective, , New York, Cambridge University Press; Bachelard, G., (1938) The Formation of the Scientific Mind, , Paris, Clinamen Press; Benson, R., (2013) Making Immigration News: A French-American Comparison, , New York, Cambridge University Press; Berry, M., No Alternative to Austerity: How BBC Broadcast News Reported the Deficit Debate (2016) Media, Culture & Society, 38 (6). , 844–63; Blumler, J., Gurevitch, M., (1995) The Crisis of Public Communication, , London, Routledge; Bourdieu, P., (1996) The Rules of Art, , Stanford, Stanford University Press; Bourdieu, P., Chamboredon, J.-C., Passeron, J.-C., (1991) The Craft of Sociology: Epistemological Preliminaries, , New York, Walter de Gruyter; Brüggemann, M., Engesser, S., Büchel, F., Humprecht, E., Castro, L., Hallin and Mancini Revisited: Four Empirical Types of Western Media Systems (2014) Journal of Communication, 64 (6). , 1037–65; Christin, A., Counting Clicks: Quantification and Variation in Web Journalism in the United States and France (2018) American Journal of Sociology, 123 (5). , 1382–415; Collier, D., Understanding Process Tracing (2011) PS: Political Science & Politics, 44 (4). , 823–30; de Vreese, C., Comparative Political Communication Research (2017) The Oxford Handbook of Political Communication, pp. 287-300. , Kenski Kate, Jamieson Kathleen Hall, (eds), Oxford, Oxford University Press, “,.”, ed; de Vreese, C., Esser, F., Hopmann, D.N., (2017) Comparing Political Journalism, , London, Routledge, eds; Downey, J., Stanyer, J., Exposing Politicians’ Peccadilloes in Comparative Context: Explaining the Frequency of Political Sex Scandals in Eight Democracies Using Fuzzy Set Qualitative Comparative Analysis (2013) Political Communication, 30 (3), pp. 495-509; Eberwein, T., Fengler, S., Lauk, E., Leppik-Bork, T., (2011) Mapping Media Accountability—In Europe and beyond, , Köln, Herbert von Halem Verlag, eds; Engesser, S., Humprecht, E., Frequency or Skillfulness: How Professional News Media Use Twitter in Five Western Countries (2015) Journalism Studies, 16 (4). , 513–29; Esser, F., The Emerging Paradigm of Comparative Communication Enquiry: Advancing Cross-National Research in Times of Globalization (2013) International Journal of Communication, 7. , 113–28; Esser, F., Hanitzsch, T., On the Why and How of Comparative Inquiry in Communication Studies (2012) Handbook of Comparative Communication Research, pp. 3-22. , Esser Frank, Hanitzsch Thomas, (eds), London, Routledge, “,.” In, ed; Esser, F., Strömbäck, J., de Vreese, C., Reviewing Key Concepts in Research on Political News Journalism: Conceptualizations, Operationalizations and Propositions for Future Research (2012) Journalism, 13 (2). , 139–43; Hallin, D., Mancini, P., (2004) Comparing Media Systems: Three Models of Media and Politics, , New York, Cambridge University Press; Hallin, D., Mancini, P., Comparing Media Systems: A Response to Critics (2012) Handbook of Comparative Communication Research, pp. 207-220. , Esser Frank, Hanitzsch Thomas, (eds), London, Routledge, “,.” In, ed; Hallin, D., Mancini, P., Ten Years after Comparing Media Systems: What Have We Learned?

Evidence of these shifts—fragmented and poorly monetized news markets, politicization of news content and funding, uneven professionalization, and even increasing openness to state involvement—have been documented in the literature for some years, but often framed as exceptions. This paper revisits Hallin and Mancini’s typology of news systems to suggest that as variants of Polarized Pluralist elements are entrenched in the American news system, it is drifting away from the Liberal model into a hybrid category of “Polarized Liberal.” Research and meta-journalism from the last decade are reviewed to characterize this hybrid model, which is applicable beyond the United States and might well become the focal point of convergence in the near future. Potential reasons for this transition are discussed, evoking sociopolitical and technological dynamics. © 2018, © The Author(s) 2018.","journalistic norms; objectivity; partisan journalism; professionalism; public sphere; the United States",,,,,,,,,,"Abramowitz, A.I., (2010) The Disappearing Center: Engaged Citizens, Polarization, and American Democracy, , New Haven, Yale University Press; Ananny, M., Crawford, K., A Liminal Press: Situating News App Designers within a Field of Networked News Production (2015) Digital Journalism, 3 (2), pp. 192-208; Ananny, M., Kreiss, D., A New Contract for the Press: Copyright, Public Domain Journalism, and Self-Governance in a Digital Age (2011) Critical Studies in Media Communication, 28 (4), p. 314. , 33; Arceneaux, K., Johnson, M., (2013) Changing Minds or Changing Channels?

The movement received media coverage for almost two months and in all news outlets, despite the protest’s broad demands and its overall radical indictment against the economic system and the status quo. This study explores the causes for this extraordinary media coverage. We find that movement characteristics of the leadership’s professional background, the media strategies they employed, and the effects of mainstream channels on media tactics were important. We also find that journalists’ personal identification with the movement is a key factor leading to the wide and favorable media coverage. Personal identification led many journalists to report favorably on the movement and write supportive opinion columns, to ignore stories that could damage it, to participate and volunteer in movement activities, and to offer their professional skills to help the movement leadership. We propose a tentative model consisting of factors and mechanisms that may explain when personal identification and journalistic activism are more likely to occur. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.","civil society; journalistic activism; journalistic norms; news reporting; partisan journalism; personal identification; social movements",,,,,,,,,,"Alimi, E.Y., ‘Occupy Israel’: A Tale of Startling Success and Hopeful Failure (2012) Social Movement Studies, 11 (3), pp. 402-407; Andrews, K.T., Caren, N., Making the News: Movement Organizations, Media Attention, and the Public Agenda (2010) American Sociological Review, 75 (6), pp. 841-866; Bennett, L.W., Segerberg, A., The Logic of Connective Action: Digital Media and the Personalization of Contentious Politics (2012) Information, Communication & Society, 15 (5), pp. 739-768; Berenson, A., ‘Painting with Words’: ‘Social Justice’ Protest’s Narrative in the Israeli’s News (2015) Journalism and Mass Communication, 5 (8), pp. 373-387; Boyle, M.P., Adherence to the Protest Paradigm: The Influence of Protest Goals and Tactics on News Coverage in U.S. and International Newspapers (2012) The International Journal of Press/Politics, 17 (2), pp. 127-144; Careless, S., Advocacy Journalism (2000) The Interim, , http://www.theinterim.com/issues/society-culture/advocacy-journalism/, May, 15, accessed October 10, 2016; Carmel, Y., Rotem, R., We Removed the Shame (2016) Davar Rishon, , http://www.davar1.co.il/24009/, July, 13, accessed October 10, 2016,).

As very few voters have direct contact with party leaders, media are voters’ primary source of information about these leaders and, thus, the likely origin of leader effects on party support. Our study focuses on these supposed electoral effects of the media coverage of party leaders. We examine the positive and negative effects of specific leadership images in Dutch newspapers on vote intentions. To this end, we combine an extensive automated content analysis of leadership images in the media with a panel data set, the Dutch 1Vandaag Opinion Panel (1VOP), consisting of more than fifty thousand unique respondents and 110 waves of interviews conducted between September 2006 and September 2012. The results confirm that media coverage of party leaders’ character traits affects voters: Positive mediated leadership images increase support for the leader’s party, while negative images decrease this support. However, this influence is not unconditional: During campaign periods, positive leadership images have a stronger effect, while negative images no longer have an impact on subsequent vote intentions. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.","content analysis; election campaign; media effects; panel data; political leadership; voting behavior; Western Europe",,,,,,"Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek, NWO

One contributor to these related phenomena may be increasing exposure to online political disagreements in which ordinary citizens criticize, and sometimes explicitly demean, opponents. This article presents two experimental studies that assessed whether U.S. partisans’ attitudes became more prejudiced in favor of the in-party after exposure to online partisan criticism. In the first study, we draw on an online convenience sample to establish that partisan criticism that derogates political opponents increases affective polarization. In the second, we replicate these findings with a quasi-representative sample and extend the pattern of findings to social polarization. We conclude that online partisan criticism likely has contributed to rising affective and social polarization in recent years between Democrats and Republicans in the United States, and perhaps between partisan and ideological group members in other developed democracies as well. We close by discussing the troubling implications of these findings in light of continuing attempts by autocratic regimes and other actors to influence democratic elections via false identities on social media. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.","affective polarization; incivility; negativity; online communication; partisan polarization",,,,,,,,,,"Anderson, A., Brossard, D., Scheufele, D.A., Xenos, M.A., Ladwig, P., The ‘Nasty Effect:’ Online Incivility and Risk Perceptions of Emerging Technologies (2014) Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication, 19 (3), pp. 373-387; Bankert, A., Huddy, L., Rosema, M., Measuring Partisanship as a Social Identity in Multi-party Systems (2017) Political Behavior, 39 (1), pp. 103-132; Barthel, M., How the 2016 Presidential Campaign Is Being Discussed on Reddit (2016) Pew Research Center, , http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/05/26/how-the-2016-presidential-campaign-is-being-discussed-on-reddit/, May, 26; Benedictus, L., Invasion of the Troll Armies: From Russian Trump Supporters to Turkish State Stooges (2016) The Guardian, , https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/nov/06/troll-armies-social-media-trump-russian, November, 6; Berinsky, A.J., Huber, G.A., Lenz, G.S., Evaluating Online Labor Markets for Experimental Research: Amazon.com’s Mechanical Turk (2012) Political Analysis, 20, pp. 351-368; Berry, J.M., Sobieraj, S., (2014) The Outrage Industry: Political Opinion Media and the New Incivility, , New York, Oxford University Press; Borah, P., Does It Matter Where You Read the News Story?

The Russian government’s narrative has prompted western concern due to fears that it exerts a destabilizing effect on societies in Eastern Europe and elsewhere. However, the behavior and thought processes of news consumers targeted by contradictory strategic narratives are rarely subjected to analysis. This paper examines how Ukrainian news consumers decide where to get their news and what to believe in a media environment where “propaganda” and “disinformation” are regarded as major threats to national security. Evidence comes from thirty audio-diaries and in-depth interviews conducted in 2016 among adult residents of Odesa Region. Through qualitative analysis of the diary and interview transcripts, the paper reveals how participants judged the credibility of news and narratives based on their priorities (what they considered important), not just “facts” (what they believed had happened). The attribution of importance to different foreign policy issues was associated, in turn, with varying personal experiences, memories, and individual cross-border relationships. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.","Eastern Europe; media audiences; political attitudes; public opinion",,,,,,"European Commission, EC

Instead, television journalism, particularly in its commercial form, has often been seen more negatively, as a form of infotainment that contributes little to the functions of journalism as an institution of democratic citizenship. Some scholars have questioned the dichotomy between infotainment and democratic roles, however, and the existing research comparing journalistic roles in print and television has produced mixed results. Focusing on the case of Chile and making use of a standardized news content-based index of journalistic roles, this study compares the prevalence of three professional roles by medium—newspapers and television—and also by audience orientation—popular and elite media across both print and television news. Our results show that commercial television in Chile is higher than print media in the performance of the watchdog and civic roles, and the infotainment role is positively, not negatively, correlated with these. We discuss the implication of these findings in light of the literature on infotainment and citizenship, as well as the emerging body of research on journalistic role performance. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.","democracy; journalism; Journalistic role performance; Latin America; print news; television news",,,,,,"Fondo Nacional de Desarrollo CientÃ­fico y TecnolÃ³gico, FONDECYT: 1150153","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: The authors received financial support for the research from Fondecyt Grant No. 1150153.",,,"Albaek, E., van Dalen, A., Jebril, N., de Vreese, C., (2014) Political Journalism in Comparative Perspective, , Cambridge, Cambridge University Press; Arroyo, L., Becerra, M., García, A., Santamaría, O., (2012) Cajas Mágicas: El Renacimiento de la Televisión Pública en América Latina, , Madrid, Editorial Tecnos; Bennett, W.L., (2003) News: The Politics of Illusion, , New York, Longman; Bourdieu, P., (1998) On Television, , New York, The New Press; Brants, K., Who’s Afraid of Infotainment?

Based on comparative survey data from the World Values Survey (WVS) and European Values Study (EVS), this study looks into national levels of trust in the press and identifies factors that drive differences across societies and individuals as well as over time. Findings indicate that the widely noted decline in media trust is not a universal trend; it is true for only about half of the studied countries, with the United States experiencing the largest and most dramatic drop in trust in the press. Political trust has emerged as key factor for our understanding of trust in the press. We found robust evidence for what we called the trust nexus—the idea that trust in the news media is strongly linked to the way publics look at political institutions. The link between press trust and political trust was considerably stronger in politically polarized societies. Furthermore, our analysis indicates that the relation between press trust and political trust is becoming stronger over time. We reason that the strong connection between media and political trust may be driven by a growing public sentiment against elite groups. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.","comparative analysis; media trust; political trust; press",,,,,,,,,,"Altheide, D.L., Snow, R.P., (1979) Media Logic, , London, Sage; Ariely, G., Trusting the Press and Political Trust: A Conditional Relationship (2015) Journal of Elections, Public Opinion and Parties, 25 (3), pp. 351-367; Baldassarri, D., Gelman, A., Partisans Without Constraint: Political Polarization and Trends in American Public Opinion (2008) American Journal of Sociology, 114, pp. 408-446; Barry, D., Barstow, D., Glater, J., Liptak, A., Steinberg, J., Correcting the record; Times Reporter Who Resigned Leaves Long Trail of Deception (2003) The New York Times, , http://www.nytimes.com/2003/05/11/us/correcting-the-record-times-reporter-who-resigned-leaves-long-trail-of-deception.html, May, 11; Bennett, S.E., Rhine, S.L., Flickinger, R.S., Bennett, L.M., ‘Video Malaise’ Revisited: Public Trust in Media and Government (1999) Harvard International Journal of Press/Politics, 4, pp. 8-23; Brants, K., de Vreese, C., Möller, J., van Praag, P., The Real Spiral of Cynicism?

Much of the literature on media freedoms has focused on structural and contextual determinants of those freedoms, with little attention to the roles played by the individuals, firms, and organizations of the media sector. Yet the record from a number of sub-Saharan African countries indicates that collective action by the actors of the media sector can help them prevail in struggles over media freedoms and positively shape the climate in which they operate. The paper illuminates this and explores the conditions that contribute to media collective action. Drawing from fieldwork conducted in three African countries, I argue that collective action is more likely where the media sector faces issues that affect most of the actors in that sector, enjoys robust organizational resources to help coordinate and sustain collective action, and operates with some level of solidarity. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.","Africa; civil liberties; collective action; media; press freedom",,,,,,"National Science Foundation, NSF

This journalistic practice has often been discussed as a potential democratic problem because of its effects on perceptions of and attitudes toward political issues. Taking exemplification theory as our starting point and drawing on research from decision-making and social psychology literature, we add to this discussion by examining how exemplars in news reports affect intentions to participate in political activities. Using an experimental design, we randomly exposed respondents to a news report with or without exemplars or no news report at all. We found that for respondents who were similar to the exemplars, exposure to a news report with exemplars triggered an empathic concern and increased political participation intentions. For dissimilar respondents, exposure to a news report with exemplars decreased empathic concern, which in turn decreased political participation intentions. By highlighting these differential effects of exemplars in the news media on political participation, the study shows how a common journalistic practice potentially engages some citizens in democracy and disengages others. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.","exemplars; journalism; media effects; political participation; similarity",,,,,,"Syddansk Universitet, SDU","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: The study was conducted within the ‘Communication and Public Engagement’ project at the Centre for Journalism, funded by a ‘2020’ research grant of the University of Southern Denmark.",,,"Aarøe, L., Investigating Frame Strength: The Case of Episodic and Thematic Frames (2011) Political Communication, 28 (2), pp. 207-226; Aarøe, L., Petersen, M.B., Crowding Out Culture: Scandinavians and Americans Agree on Social Welfare in the Face of Deservingness Cues (2014) Journal of Politics, 76 (3), pp. 684-697; Baes-Jørgensen, J., Ældrepleje er det hotteste valgtema (2013) Momentum, , www.kl.dk/Momentum/momentum2013-18-2-id141868/?n=0, November, 11, accessed February 21, 2017; Batson, C.D., (1991) The Altruism Question: Toward a Social-Psychological Answer, , Hillsdale, Lawrence Erlbaum; Batson, C.D., (2011) Altruism in Humans, , New York, NY, Oxford University Press; Beckers, K., Walgrave, S., Van den Bulck, H., Opinion Balance in Vox Pop Television News (2016) Journalism Studies, , May, 31,.

Few studies have systematically or longitudinally investigated the relationship between candidate gender, competitiveness, and media visibility during election or party leadership campaigns. Moreover, studies of media visibility tend to focus exclusively on the presence of candidates in news stories, as measured by one or more mentions per story. Examining six textual and visual elements in Globe and Mail reporting of eleven Canadian national leadership campaigns held between 1975 and 2012, we discover that it is candidate competitiveness and novelty and not candidate gender that influences the media visibility of party leadership hopefuls. Canada provides a useful case study when exploring the relationship between gender and media visibility because many women have sought, and four have won, the leadership of national parties. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.","Canada; gendered mediation; leadership; media visibility; newspapers; political parties",,,,,,"Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada, SSHRC","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: Funding for this project was provided by a Standard Research Grant from the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada.",,,"Aday, S., Devitt, J., Style over Substance: Newspaper Coverage of Elizabeth Dole’s Presidential Bid (2001) Harvard International Journal of Press/Politics, 6 (2), pp. 52-73; Aalberg, T., Stromback, J., Media-Driven Men and Media-Critical Women?

In this article, we investigate how mass media cover demonstration size. We develop a typology of turnout coverage and scrutinize the factors that drive turnout coverage. In addition, we test whether media coverage underestimates, reflects, or exaggerates “guesstimates” by organizers and police forces. Together, these analyses shed light on whether turnout coverage fits a logic of normalization or marginalization. We rely on a unique dataset of 428 demonstrations organized in Brussels (2003–2010). For these demonstrations, we have information on the turnout as reported in national television news, as counted by the police, and as expected by the organizers. We find that media present turnout most often as a fact, rarely as contentious (10 percent). Although few demonstrations pass the media gates, our study yields little to no evidence for a logic of turnout marginalization. Media coverage does not systematically underestimate demonstration size, nor does it blindly follow police counts. Rather, turnout coverage attests of a logic of normalization, following standard news-making practices. The more important the demonstration (size, lead item) and the larger the gap between police and organizer guesstimates, the more attention is paid to turnout in the news. Discussion centers on the generalizability and normative interpretation of the results. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.","media bias; news reporting; social movements; television news",,,,,,,,,,"Amenta, E., Gardner, B.G., Tierney, A.C., Yerena, A., Elliott, T.A., A Story-Centered Approach to the Newspaper Coverage of High-Profile SMOs (2012) Research in Social Movements, Conflict and Change, 33, pp. 83-107; Bennett, L., Toward a Theory of Press-State Relations in the United States (1990) Journal of Communication, 40 (2), pp. 103-125; Biggs, M., Size Matters: Quantifying Protest by Counting Participants (2016) Sociological Methods & Research, , Published electronically February; Boyle, M., McCluskey, M., Devanathan, N., Stein, S., McLeod, D., The Influence of Level of Deviance and Protest Type on Coverage of Social Protest in Wisconsin from 1960 to 1999 (2004) Mass Communication and Society, 7 (1), pp. 43-60; Boyle, M., McCluskey, M., McLeod, D., Stein, S., Newspapers and Protest: An Examination of Protest Coverage from 1960 to 1999 (2005) Journalism & Mass Communication Quarterly, 82 (3), pp. 638-653; Boyle, M., McLeod, D., Armstrong, C., Adherence to the Protest Paradigm: The Influence of Protest Goals and Tactics on News Coverage in U.S. and International Newspapers (2012) The International Journal of Press/Politics, 17 (2), pp. 127-144; Brasted, M., Framing Protest: The Chicago Tribune and the New York Times during the 1968 Democratic Convention (2005) Atlantic Journal of Communication, 13 (1), pp. 1-25; Burstein, P., Social Movements and Public Policy (1999) How Social Movements Matter, pp. 3-21. , Giugni, McAdam, Tilly, (eds), Minneapolis, University of Minnesota Press,.” In, ed; Caren, N., Ghoshal, R.A., Ribas, V., A Social Movement Generation: Cohort and Period Trends In Protest Attendance and Petition Signing (2011) American Sociological Review, 76 (1), pp. 125-151; Carragee, K.M., Roefs, W., The Neglect of Power in Recent Framing Research (2004) Journal of Communication, 54 (2), pp. 214-233; Cottle, S., Reporting Demonstrations: The Changing Media Politics of Dissent (2008) Media, Culture & Society, 30 (6), pp. 853-872; Dalton, R.J., Citizenship Norms and the Expansion of Political Participation (2008) Political Studies, 56 (1), pp. 76-98; Danielian, L., Page, B., The Heavenly Chorus: Interest Group Voices on TV News (1994) American Journal of Political Science, 38 (4), pp. 1056-1078; della Porta, D., Diani, M., Forms, Repertoires and Cycles of Protest (1999) Social Movements: An Introduction, pp. 165-192. , della Porta, Diani, (eds), Oxford, Blackwell,.” In, ed; De Nardo, J., (1985) Power in Numbers: The Political Strategy of Protest and Rebellion, , Princeton, Princeton University Press; De Swert, K., (2011) Where Is the Balance in the News?

This study investigates the personalization of ministerial communication in Norway, a type of decentralized personalization. It combines a survey of communication workers; in-depth interviews with politicians, communication workers, political reporters, and top-level civil servants; and ethnographic observation inside a ministry. The article goes beyond media-centered perspectives and identifies several potential drivers and barriers to personalization processes. Based on our mixed methods approach, we find that ministerial communication in Norway is strongly centered on the minister in both reactive media management and the proactive promotion of the minister and new policies. This decentralized personalization is driven by both demands from the media and the strategic adaptation by political and administrative actors within ministries. Based on the rich empirically grounded insights, the article discusses how the interplay between the logic of the contemporary commercial news media, political ambitions, internal administrative ambitions, and changes in executive government shapes the personalization of ministerial communication, and illuminates how these multiple drivers of personalization are mutually reinforcing. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.","government; mixed methods; news production; Norway; personalization; policy making; reporters",,,,,,"Norges ForskningsrÃ¥d","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship and/or publication of this article:The study is part of the Media Impact in the Public Service Sector project (project 237014) funded by the The Research Council of Norway.",,,"Adam, S., Meier, M., Personalization of Politics: A Critical Review and Agenda for Future Research (2010) Communication Yearbook, 34, pp. 213-257. , Salmon Charles, (ed), London, Routledge,.” In, ed; Altheide, D.L., Media Logic and Political Communication (2004) Political Communication, 21 (3), pp. 293-296; Askim, J., Karlsen, R., Kolltveit, K., Political Appointees in Executive Government: Exploring and Explaining Roles Using a Large-N Survey in Norway (2017) Public Administration, 95, pp. 342-358; Balmas, M., Rahat, G., Sheafer, T., Shenhav, S.R., Two Routes to Personalized Politics: Centralized and Decentralized Personalization (2014) Party Politics, 20 (1), pp. 37-51; Beckett, C., Deuze, M., On the Role of Emotion in the Future of Journalism (2016) Social Media & Society, 2 (3), pp. 1-6; Bjerling, J., (2012) The Personalization of Swedish Politics, , University of Gothenburg,.” Ph.D. diss; Brüggemann, M., Engesser, S., Büchel, F., Humprecht, E., Castro, L., Hallin and Mancini Revisited: Four Empirical Types of Western Media Systems (2014) Journal of Communication, 64, pp. 1037-1065; Campus, D., Mediatization and Personalization of Politics in Italy and France: The Cases of Berlusconi and Sarkozy (2010) International Journal of Press/Politics, 15 (2), pp. 219-235; Canel, M.J., Sanders, K., Government Communication: An Emerging Field in Political Communication Research (2012) The Sage Handbook of Political Communication Research, pp. 85-96. , Semetko, Scammel, (eds), London, Sage, In, ed., (; Carpenter, D.P., (2001) The Forging of Bureaucratic Autonomy: Reputations, Networks, Reputations and Policy Innovation in Executive Agencies, 1862–1928, , Princeton, Princeton University Press; Carpenter, D.P., Krause, G.A., Reputation and Public Administration (2012) Public Administration Review, 72 (1), pp. 26-32; Chadwick, A., (2013) The Hybrid Media System: Politics and Power, , Oxford, Oxford University Press; Christensen, T., The Norwegian State Transformed (2005) West European Politics, 29 (1), pp. 1-20; Christensen, T., The Development and Current Features of the Norwegian Civil Service System (2011) Civil Systems in Western Europe, pp. 67-98. , Vaer Meer Frits M., (ed), Cheltenham, Edward Elgar, In, ed., (; Christensen, T., Lægreid, P., New Public Management: The Effects of Contractualism and Devolution on Political Control (2001) Public Management Review, 3 (1), pp. 73-94; Christensen, T., Lægreid, P., Regulatory Agencies: The Challenges of Balancing Agency Autonomy and Political Control (2007) Governance: An International Journal of Policy, Administration, and Institutions, 20 (3), pp. 499-520; Christensen, T., Lægreid, P., Roness, P.G., Increasing Parliamentary Control of the Executive?

However, individual politicians’ goals and attitudes are also expected to shape their level of responsiveness to the media. This study is the first to explore how individual politicians’ goals and motivations moderate their real-life level of responsiveness to the media. We examine this by using a unique sample of 197 incumbent politicians in three countries (Belgium, Canada, and Israel) and an automated content analysis of parliamentary speeches (N = 45,574) and news articles (N = 412,112). We find that politicians who view themselves as a conduit of the public (delegates) are more responsive to the media than those acting on their own judgment (trustees). Politicians involved in many issues (generalists) are also more responsive than specialists. Finally, no association is found between politicians’ negativity bias and their media responsiveness. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.","automated content analysis; media; MPs; political agenda setting; political elites; representation",,,,,,"European Research Council, ERC: 295735

Without more comparative research, we know little about whether the findings are generalizable, however, and thus cannot be certain of their causes. But comparative research presents several challenges. This paper takes advantage of the case of the War on Iraq to examine the effects of partisan press coverage on perceptions of leaders and ultimately on voting behavior in two countries, the United States and Britain. We test three competing hypotheses of partisan media effects. We find support for the argument that the reputation of the incumbent party moderates the influence of partisan coverage on perceptions of war but also show that opposition partisan media coverage undermines perceptions of the qualities of incumbent leaders. Media outlets that support the incumbent do not have similar positive effects. We conclude that the war cost a left-wing leader, Blair, more than a right-wing leader, Bush, because of (1) the ambivalence of incumbent-supporting newspapers in Britain, (2) the absence of a parallel to the boost in approval that incumbent-supporting newspapers provided for Bush, and (3) greater damage to perceptions of Blair’s attributes among readers of opposition-supporting newspapers. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.","media audiences; partisan journalism; voting behavior",,,,,,,,,,"Albaek, E., van Dalen, A., Jebril, N., de Vreese, C., (2014) Political Journalism in Comparative Perspective, , Cambridge, Cambridge University Press; Ansolabehere, S., Lessem, R., Snyder, J., The Orientation of Newspaper Endorsements in U.S. Elections, 1940-2002 (2006) Quarterly Journal of Political Science, 1, pp. 393-404; Baum, M., Potter, P., The Relationships between Mass Media, Public Opinion, and Foreign Policy: Toward a Theoretical Synthesis (2008) Annual Review of Political Science, 11, pp. 39-65; Berinsky, A., (2009) In Time of War: Understanding American Public Opinion from World War II to Iraq, , Chicago, University of Chicago Press; Brüggemann, M., Engesser, S., Büchel, F., Humprecht, E., Castro, L., Hallin and Mancini Revisited: Four Empirical Types of Western Media Systems (2014) Journal of Communication, 64, pp. 1037-1065; Clarke, H., Sanders, D., Stewart, M., Whiteley, P., (2009) Performance Politics and the British Voter, , Cambridge, Cambridge University Press; Croco, S., The Decider’s Dilemma: Leader Culpability, War Outcomes, and Domestic Punishment (2011) American Political Science Review, 105, pp. 457-477; Curran, J., Aalberg, T., (2013) How Media Inform Democracy: A Comparative Approach, , Oxford, Routledge, eds; Dalton, R., Beck, P., Huckfeldt, R., Partisan Cues and the Media: Information Flows in the 1992 Presidential Election (1998) American Political Science Review, 92, pp. 111-126; de Leon, F.L.L., Endorse or Not to Endorse: Understanding the Determinants of Newspapers’ Likelihood of Making Political Recommendations (2016) Scottish Journal of Political Economy, 63, pp. 357-376; Dilliplane, S., Activation, Conversion, or Reinforcement?

This study isolates the factors that explain the relative success and failure of competitive frames that are either in favor of or against activating policies in European news coverage, by applying time-series analysis (ordinary least squares with panel-corrected standard errors) to monthly aggregated news coverage in the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, Denmark, and Spain over the timespan 2006–2013. The results show that pro-activating and counteractivating frames generally coincide in competitive framing environments. The pro-activating frame proliferated in times of high employment protection, whereas the counteractivating frame prevailed stronger in conservative compared with progressive newspapers, and gained momentum during the aftermath of the financial crisis and in times governments on the economic left were in power. The study advances knowledge of competitive issue framing by demonstrating how the economic, policy, and political context matters for the emergence and evolvement of competing frames. In addition, the findings contribute to the understanding of the factors that contribute to news representations that promote active aging in European news, which may foster support for policy reforms that sustain older workers’ employability. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.","active aging; competitive framing; framing; policy reforms; workforce aging",,,,,,,,,,"Andersen, T., Haahr, J.H., Hansen, M.E., Holm-Pedersen, M., (2008) Job Mobility in the European Union: Optimising Its Social and Economic Benefits, , Centre for Policy and Business Analysis, Danish Technological Institute, Taastrup,.” No. VT/2006/043; Andersen, T.M., Svarer, M., Flexicurity—Labour Market Performance in Denmark (2007) CESifo Economic Studies, 53 (3), pp. 389-429. , http://cesifo.oxfordjournals.org/content/53/3/389.short; Auer, P., Fortuny, M., (2000) Ageing of the Labour Force in OECD Countries: Economic and Social Consequences, , International Labour Office, Geneva; Bakker, R., Erica, E., Liesbet, H., Seth, J., Gary, M., Jonathan, P., Jan, R., Milada, V., (2015) 2014 Chapel Hill Expert Survey, , chesdata.eu, et al.,.” Version 2015.1.

The recent digitalization wave, however, challenges some of its basic presuppositions. We discuss three assumptions that cannot be applied to online and social media unconditionally: one, that media agendas should be measured on an issue level; two, that fixed time lags suffice to understand overlap in media content; and three, that media can be considered homogeneous entities. To address these challenges, we propose a “news story” approach as an alternative way of mapping how news spreads through the media. We compare this with a “traditional” analysis of time-series data. In addition, we differentiate between three groups of actors that use Twitter. For these purposes, we study online and offline media alike, applying both measurement methods to the 2014 Belgium election campaign. Overall, we find that online media outlets strongly affect other media that publish less often. Yet, our news story analysis emphasizes the need to look beyond publication schemes. “Slow” newspapers, for example, often precede other media’s coverage. Underlining the necessity to distinguish between Twitter users, we find that media actors on Twitter have vastly more agenda-setting influence than other actors do. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.","intermedia agenda setting; Internet; journalism; social media; Twitter",,,,,,,,,,"Atwater, T., Fico, F., Pizante, G., Reporting on the State Legislature: A Case Study of Inter-media Agenda-Setting (1987) Newspaper Research Journal, 8 (2), pp. 53-61; Baumgartner, F., Jones, B.D., (1993) Agendas and Instability in American politics, , Chicago, University of Chicago Press; Beckers, K., Harder, R.A., Twitter Just Exploded (2016) Digital Journalism, 4, pp. 910-920; Breed, W., Newspaper ‘Opinion Leaders’ and Processes of Standardization (1955) Journalism Quarterly, 32, pp. 277-284; Broersma, M., Graham, T., Tipping the Balance of Power Social Media and the Transformation of Political Journalism (2016) The Routledge Companion to Social Media and Politics, pp. 89-103. , Bruns Axel, Enli Gunn, Skogerbø Eli, Larsson Anders Olaf, Christensen Christian, (eds), New York, Routledge,.” In, ed; Bruns, A., Highfield, T., Blogs, Twitter, and Breaking News: The Produsage of Citizen Journalism (2012) Produsing Theory in a Digital World: The Intersection of Audiences and Production, pp. 15-32. , Lind Rebecca Ann, (ed), New York, Peter Lang,.” In, ed; Buhl, F., Günther, E., Quandt, T., Observing the Dynamics of the Online News Ecosystem (2016) Journalism Studies, , April, 26,.

However, it remains challenging to explain the different patterns of interaction observed in different contexts. To address that challenge, this study draws theoretically on the concept of “political communication cultures” and transfers the logic of internationally comparative research to the local level to analyze patterns and causes of politics–media interactions in a large number of diverse contexts. To this end, micro-level empirical data from a representative survey of more than 600 local political actors and journalists in fifty-two German cities were integrated with macro-level data describing the social, political, and media contexts of those cities. This allows us, first, to describe patterns of politics–media relations at the notoriously under-researched local level in terms of proximity, dependency, and seclusiveness of the politics–media milieu. Second, we are able to investigate various potential micro- and macro-level causes of those patterns. We show that different dimensions of relationships are variously affected by different factors; among these, media and political competition seem to be significant predictors of politics–media relations. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.","international and comparative; news/journalism; politicians/legislatures; quantitative survey",,,,,,,,,,"Althaus, S.L., Cizmar, A.M., Gimpel, J.G., Media Supply, Audience Demand, and the Geography of News Consumption in the United States (2009) Political Communication, 26 (3), pp. 249-277; Anderson, C.W., Journalistic Networks and the Diffusion of Local News: The Brief, Happy News Life of the ‘Francisville Four.’ (2010) Political Communication, 27 (3), pp. 289-309; Arzberger, K., Murck, M., Vollmer, R., Bürger, Presse und Eliten (1981) Materialien für Lokaljournalisten, pp. 84-143. , Lokaljournalisten Projektteam, (ed), München, Ölschläger, ].

It is based on a two-step methodology. First, a network analysis of country co-mentions in American, British, French, and German news corpus shows that core countries (e.g., the United States) and their opponents (e.g., North Korea, Russia, Iran) are the most frequently cited in provocation narratives. Focusing on the case where provocation narratives are the most prominent, the Korean conflict, we then employ a quantitative content analysis to identify the relationships between the countries involved in news stories using provocation narratives, and the role played by the provocation in those news stories. Our findings show that bias is introduced in many instances where journalists, while repeatedly identifying one country, North Korea, as the provocateur, omit key information such as the reasons behind North Korea’s provocations or the identity of the provoked country. This indicates that provocation narratives adopt the core countries’ geopolitical views and portray their enemies as a global threat. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.","country prominence; cross-national comparison; international news; narrative; network analysis; provocation",,,,,,,,,,"Benson, R., The Political/Literary Model of French Journalism: Change and Continuity in Immigration News Coverage, 1973–1991 (2002) Journal of European Area Studies, 10, pp. 49-70; Benson, R., Mapping Field Variation: Journalism in France and the United States (2005) Bourdieu and the Journalistic Field, pp. 85-112. , Benson Rodney, Neveu Erik, (eds), Cambridge, Polity Press,.” In, ed; Betschart, A., Hackel, M., Minot, M., von Wroblewsky, V., (2014) Sartre: Eine Permanente Provokation; Une Provocation Permanente, , Frankfurt am Main, Peter Lang Gmbh, Internationaler Verlag Der Wissenschaften; Boudana, S., Impartiality Is Not fair: Toward an Alternative Approach to the Evaluation of Content Bias in News Stories (2016) Journalism: Theory, Practice and Criticism, 17 (5), pp. 600-618; Boudana, S., Segev, E., Theorizing provocation narratives as communication strategies Comunication Theory, , Forthcoming. “; Brandes, U., Gaertler, M., Wagner, D., (2003) Experiments on Graph Clustering Algorithms, pp. 568-579. , Battista Giusee Di, Zwick Uri, (eds), The 11th European Symposium on Algorithms, Berlin, Springer,.” In, ed; Choi, J., The Representation of North Korean National Image in National Newspapers in the United States (2010) Public Relations Review, 36, pp. 392-394; D’Alessio, D., Allen, M., Media Bias in Presidential Elections: A Meta-Analysis (2000) Journal of Communication, 50 (4), pp. 133-156; Driessens, O., ‘Do (Not) Go to Vote!’ Media Provocation Explained (2013) European Journal of Communication, 28 (5), pp. 556-569; Entman, R.M., Framing: Toward Clarification of a Fractured Paradigm (1993) Journal of Communication, 43 (4), pp. 51-68; Entman, R.M., Framing Bias: Media in the Distribution of Power (2007) Journal of Communication, 57 (1), pp. 163-173; Esser, F., Dimensions of Political News Cultures: Sound Bite and Image Bite News in France, Germany, Great Britain and the United States (2008) The International Journal of Press/Politics, 13 (4), pp. 401-428; Esser, F., Umbricht, A., Competing Models of Journalism?

The 2015 United Kingdom General Election offers an important case study of how such practices are evolving and being deployed in a different setting. This article draws on thirty-one in-depth interviews with political practitioners involved in the use of data for six major UK parties and electoral regulators. These interviews are employed to explore the perceived importance of data in contemporary British campaigns, to understand the data-based campaign techniques being used by UK parties, and to assess how data-driven practices are interacting with the preexisting institutional context of British politics. Going beyond the specifics of the UK case, this study raises questions about the comparative, theoretical, and normative dimensions of data-driven politics. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.","election campaign; political parties; Western Europe",,,,,,,,,,"Anstead, N., The Internet and Campaign Finance in the US and the UK: An Institutional Comparison (2008) Journal of Information Technology & Politics, 5, pp. 285-302; Anstead, N., A Different Beast?

The dynamic of the journalist–source relationship has, however, mostly been analyzed in stable high-income democracies. This article goes beyond existing research by analyzing the relationship between reporters and officials in Nigeria, in principle, a democracy but in practice, a hybrid regime where journalists face substantial political pressures. Through a combination of content analysis and in-depth interviews, it shows how journalists in Nigeria are not only dependent on the information subsidies found in the West but also affected by politicians using positive (monetary awards) and negative (intimidation and violence) tangible incentives that go well beyond information subsidies. The article argues that this shapes the nature of coproduction of news in Nigeria and that more broadly, the resources available to politicians to influence journalists through such positive tangible incentives and the degree to which they, with impunity, can use negative tangible incentives, should be key dimensions for future comparative work on relations between reporters and officials as political communication research goes beyond stable democracies where money handouts and violence is unlikely to be the key factors influencing news production. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.","journalistic norms; news gathering; news production; sources; state–media relations",,,,,,,,,,"Adetula, V.A.O., (2015) Godfathers, Money Politics, and Electoral Violence in Nigeria: Focus on 2015 Elections, , Being a paper presented at the two-day National Conference on the 2015 General Elections in Nigeria: The Real Issues held at the Electoral Institute Complex, Abuja; Agbese, A.-O., (2006) The Role of the Press and Communication Technology in Democratization: The Nigerian Story, , New York, Routledge; Aiyetan, D., A War Gone Comatose (2002) Tell, pp. 33-41. , December; Althaus, S.L., When News Norms Collide, Follow the Lead: New Evidence for Press Independence (2003) Political Communication, 20, pp. 381-414; Barker-Plummer, B., (1989) Look Who’s Talking: A Study of Institutional Sources in Two Major Papers 1885-1985, , files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED309437.pdf, accessed July 6, 2015; Bello, K., God-Fatherism in the Politics of Nigeria: Continuity and Change (2011) Canadian Social Science, 7 (2), pp. 256-260; Benavides, J.L., Gacetilla: A Keyword for a Revisionist Approach to the Political Economy of Mexico’s Print News Media (2000) Media, Culture & Society, 22 (1), pp. 85-104; Bennett, L.W., (2007) News: The Politics of Illusion, , New York, Pearson/Longman; Berkowitz, D.A., Reporters and Their Sources (2009) The Handbook of Journalism studies, pp. 102-115. , Wahl-Jorgensen Karin, Hanitzsch Thomas, (eds), New York, Routledge,.” In, ed., (; Blumler, J.G., Gurevitch, M., (1995) The Crisis of Public Communication, , London, Routledge; Casero-Ripollés, A., Fernández-Beaumont, J., Santamaría, J.V.G., The Politicisation of Journalism in Spain: Three Obstacles to the Professional Autonomy of Journalists (2015) Anàlisi.

This paper studies how the performance of the watchdog and civic journalism role in Chilean newspapers develops during 22 years of democratic transition. We challenge the homogenization-thesis, which has often characterized thinking about the role of the media in democratic transition, assuming an automatic unidirectional trend toward more critical professionalism, where reporters increasingly act as watchdogs by taking the side of ordinary citizens against the political and economic elite. We argue that a rise in critical professionalism is often limited to a brief honeymoon period after the return to democracy. We furthermore argue that to understand changing role performance during democratic transition, one needs to look at specific developments of the media (press freedom, journalism education, advertisement income, and circulation) and developments in the political context, in particular the degree of political conflict. These hypotheses are tested with a unique data set consisting of a content analysis of 20,201 news articles, which make up representative yearly samples of newspaper coverage in Chile between 1990 and 2011. We find no trend toward more watchdog and civic journalism, and limited influences of developments of the media. At least for the performance of these two journalistic roles in Chile, changes in journalism during democratic transition can best be explained by the honeymoon hypothesis and the degree of political conflict. The generalizability of these findings to other transitional democracies is discussed. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.","content analysis; homogenization; journalism; journalistic role performance; political conflict; transitional democracies",,,,,,,,,,"Barrera, C., Zugasti, R., The Role of the Press in Times of Transition: The Building of the Spanish Democracy (1975–78) (2006) Mass Media and Political Communication in New Democracies, pp. 23-41. , tmer, (ed), London, Routledge,.” In, ed; Bennett, W.L., Toward a Theory of Press-State Relations in the United States (1990) Journal of Communication, 40 (2), pp. 103-127; Benson, R., Hallin, D.C., How States, Markets and Globalization Shape the News.

Scholars now try to get grip on the mechanisms underlying these findings. This paper focuses on the media’s informational function as a driver of political agenda-setting processes. It studies the extent to which politicians, when reacting to media information, really learn about the information from the media—as opposed to instances where the media function as an amplifier rather than as the true source of policy-relevant information. The matter is investigated by means of a survey with Members of Parliament (MPs) in Belgium, Canada, and Israel (N = 376). We confronted the MPs with news stories that had recently been in the media, asking them whether they undertook political action on the news story and whether they knew about the news story before it appeared in the media. We show that politicians mostly knew about the information before it appeared in the media—but that there is variation between politicians and types of action in this respect. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.","information processing; mass media; political agenda setting; political elites; press/politics",,,,,,,,,,"Arceneaux, K., Johnson, M., Lindstädt, R., Vander Wielen, R.J., The Influence of News Media on Political Elites: Investigating Strategic Responsiveness in Congress (2016) American Journal of Political Science, 60 (1), pp. 5-29; Baumgartner, F.R., Jones, B.D., (1993) Agendas and Instability in American Politics, , Chicago, University of Chicago Press; Baumgartner, F.R., Jones, B.D., (2015) The Politics of Information: Problem Definition and the Course of Public Policy in America, , Chicago, University of Chicago Press; Bonafont, L.C., Baumgartner, F.R., Newspaper Attention and Policy Activities in Spain (2013) Journal of Public Policy, 33 (1), pp. 65-88; Brown, R., The Media and the Policy Process (2010) Public Policy and Mass Media: The Interplay of Mass Communication and Political Decision Making, pp. 127-142. , Koch-Baumgarten Sigrid, tmer Katrin, (eds), New York, Routledge,.” In, ed; Cohen, B.C., (1963) The Press and Foreign Policy, , http://press.princeton.edu/titles/3676.html, accessed October 19, 2015; Cohen, J., Tsfati, Y., Sheafer, T., The Influence of Presumed Media Influence in Politics: Do Politicians’ Perceptions of Media Power Matter?

This suggests that what viewers want from political journalism might differ from what journalists produce yet is perfectly compatible with their democratic remit. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.","current affairs TV; journalism; political information; qualitative audience research",,,,,,,,,,"Bartsch, A., Schneider, F.M., Entertainment and Politics Revisited: How Non-Escapist Forms of Entertainment Can Stimulate Political Interest and Information Seeking (2014) Journal of Communication, 64 (3), pp. 369-396; Batsell, J., (2015) Engaged Journalism: Connecting with Digitally Empowered News Audiences, , New York, Columbia University Press; Baum, M.A., Sex, Lies, and War: How Soft News Brings Foreign Policy to the Inattentive Public (2002) American Political Science Review, 96 (1), pp. 91-109; Blekesaune, A., Elvestad, E., Aalberg, T., Tuning Out the World of News and Current Affairs—An Empirical Study of Europe’s Disconnected Citizens (2012) European Sociological Review, 28 (1), pp. 110-126; Boukes, M., Boomgaarden, H.G., Moorman, M., de Vreese, C.H., Political News With a Personal Touch: How Human Interest Framing Indirectly Affects Policy Attitudes (2015) Journalism & Mass Communication Quarterly, 92 (1), pp. 121-141; Cappella, J.N., Jamieson, K.H., (1997) Spiral of Cynicism: The Press and the Public Good, , New York, Oxford University Press; Coleman, S., Moss, G., Rethinking Election Debates: What Citizens Are Entitled to Expect (2016) The International Journal of Press/Politics, 21 (1), pp. 3-24; Coleman, S., Ross, K., (2010) The Media and the Public: “Them” and “Us” in Media Discourse, , Chichester, Wiley-Blackwell; Costera Meijer, I., The Public Quality of Popular Journalism: Developing a Normative Framework (2001) Journalism Studies, 2 (2), pp. 189-205; Costera Meijer, I., The Paradox of Popularity: How Young People Experience the News (2007) Journalism Studies, 8 (1), pp. 96-116; Ekman, J., Amnå, E., Political Participation and Civic Engagement: Towards a New Typology (2012) Human Affairs, 22 (3), pp. 283-300; Gillham, B., (2005) Research Interviewing: The Range of Techniques, , Maidenhead, Open University Press; Grabe, M.E., Lang, A., Zhao, X., News Content and Form: Implications for Memory and Audience Evaluations (2003) Communication Research, 30 (4), pp. 387-413; Grabe, M.E., Zhou, S., Lang, A., Bolls, P.D., Packaging Television News: The Effects of Tabloid on Information Processing and Evaluative Responses (2000) Journal of Broadcasting & Electronic Media, 44 (4), pp. 581-598; Green, M.C., Brock, T.C., The Role of Transportation in the Persuasiveness of Public Narratives (2000) Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 79 (5), pp. 701-721; Henderson, L., News for Everyone?

We begin to answer this increasingly important but underresearched question with a year-long case study of the humanitarian news organistion IRIN as it transitioned from being funded by the United Nations to a private foundation, run by a Malaysian billionaire. Using content analysis, in-depth interviews, and ethnographic research, we document the changes that occurred in IRIN’s outputs, target audience, and public service values, and the complex interplay of influences that produced these changes. We find that, in this case, donor power operated entirely indirectly and always in concert with the dominant professional values within IRIN. In doing so, this case study highlights the importance of journalistic agency and contextual variables in the journalist–donor relationship, as well as the potential significance of contradictory dynamics. We also use this case to test whether Benson, Hessérus and Sedel’s model of media owner power can help to explain the workings of donor power. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.","foreign news; global news; global news agencies; journalism; news production; war coverage",,,,,,,,,,"Aly, H., Media Perspectives: A Means to an End?

We analyze media coverage of sixteen focusing events related to Dutch immigration policies—an intractable policy controversy that is regularly under media scrutiny. In addition to the quantity of media attention, we take into account whether dominant framing in media coverage is contesting the current policy frame and whether the framing in the media is consonant. Our analysis indicates that frame contestation is a necessary condition for media effects. Quantity of media attention and frame consonance are relevant indicators of changes on the policy agenda only when the majority of media coverage is contesting the current policy frame. Furthermore, we found that in the case of intractable policy controversies, media framing can create specific dynamics, such as “David versus Goliath” dynamics where human-interest framing of a single case challenges current policy, or “negotiation dynamics” where competing managerialist frames negotiate policy solutions. An integration of framing and agenda-setting literatures helps develop a better understanding of the occurrence of media effects on the policy agenda and how this effect takes shape in the case of intractable policy controversies. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.","agenda-setting; immigration policies; media framing; policy agenda; qualitative comparative analysis (QCA)",,,,,,,,,,"Baker, P., Tony, M., A Corpus-based Approach to Discourses of Refugees and Asylum Seekers in UN and Newspaper Texts (2005) Journal of Language and Politics, 4 (2), pp. 197-226; Baumgartner, F.R., Jones, B.D., (1993) Agendas and Instability in American Politics, , Chicago, The University of Chicago Press; Benson, R., (2013) Shaping Immigration News: A French-American Comparison, , Cambridge, Cambridge University Press; Birkland, T.A., (2011) An Introduction to the Policy Process: Theories, Concepts and Models of Public Policy Making, , 3rd Edition., Armonk, M.E.

The structure of communication affordances creates opportunities for a horizontal organization power within Twitter interactions. However, one cannot infer the structure of interactions as they materialize from the formal properties of the technical environment in which the communications occur. Consequently, the paper identifies three categories of empowering communication operations that can occur on Twitter: Campaigns can respond to others, campaigns can retweet others, and campaigns can call for others to become involved in the campaign on their own terms. The paper operationalizes these categories in the context of the 2015 U.K. general election. To determine whether Twitter is used to empower laypersons, the profiles of each account retweeted and replied to were retrieved and analyzed using natural language processing to identify whether an account is from a political figure, member of the media, or some other public figure. In addition, tweets and retweets are compared with respect to the manner key election issues are discussed. The findings indicate that empowering uses of Twitter are fairly marginal, and retweets use almost identical policy language as the original campaign tweets. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.","election campaign; Internet; political participation; political parties",,,,,,,,,,"Anstead, N., Chadwick, A., Parties, Election Campaigning, and the Internet: Toward a Comparative Perspective (2009) Routledge Handbook of Internet Politics, pp. 56-72. , Chadwick Andrew, Howard Philip N., (eds), New York, Routledge,.” In, ed; Bakhtin, M.M., (1981) The Dialogic Imagination: Four Essays, , Austin, University of Texas Press; Bang, H.P., (2003) Governance as Social and Political Communication, , Manchester, Manchester University Press; Bang, H.P., ‘Yes We Can:’ Identity Politics and Project Politics for a Late-Modern World (2009) Urban Research & Practice, 2 (2), pp. 117-137; Beck, P.A., Dalton, R., Greene, S., Huckfeldt, R., The Social Calculus of Voting: Interpersonal, Media, and Organizational Influences on Presidential Choices (2002) American Political Science Review, 96 (1), pp. 57-73; Benkler, Y., (2006) The Wealth of Networks: How Social Production Transforms Markets and Freedom, , New Haven, Yale University Press; Bennett, W.L., Segerberg, A., (2013) The Logic of Connective Action: Digital Media and the Personalization of Contentious Politics, , New York, Cambridge University Press; Bimber, B., Flanagin, A., Stohl, C., (2012) Collective Action in Organizations: Interaction and Engagement in an Era of Technological Change, , New York, Cambridge University Press; Bird, S., Klein, E., Loper, E., (2009) Natural Language Processing with Python, , Sebastopol, O’Reilly Media; Burke, K., (1966) Language as Symbolic Action: Essays on Life, Literature, and Method, , Berkeley, University of California Press; Burke, K., (1974) The Philosophy of Literary Form: Studies in Symbolic Action, , Berkeley, University of California Press; Burke, K., (1989) On Symbols and Society, , Chicago, University of Chicago Press; Butler, S.H., Teaching Rhetoric through Data Visualization (2011) Communication Teacher, 25 (3), pp. 131-135; Carmody, T., Facebook is wrong, text is deathless (2016) Available from:, , http://kottke.org/16/06/facebook-is-wrong-text-is-deathless, Accessed 17 Jun 2016; Castells, M., (2009) Communication Power, , Oxford, Oxford University Press; Chadwick, A., (2013) The Hybrid Media System: Politics and Power, , New York, Oxford University Press; Converse, P.E., Information Flow and the Stability of Partisan Attitudes (1962) Public Opinion Quarterly, 26 (4), pp. 578-599; Crozier, M.P., Governing Codes: Information Dynamics and Contemporary Coordination Challenges (2012) Administration & Society, 47 (2), pp. 151-170; Dalton, R.J., (2013) The Apartisan American: Dealignment and Changing Electoral Politics, , Washington, D.C., CQ Press; della Porta, D., (2013) Can Democracy Be Saved: Participation, Deliberation and Social Movements, , New York, John Wiley & Sons; Easton, D., (1965) A Systems Analysis of Political Life, , New York, John Wiley & Sons; Flanagin, A.J., Stohl, C., Bimber, B., Modeling the Structure of Collective Action (2006) Communication Monographs, 73 (1), pp. 29-54; Foss, S.K., Griffin, C.L., Beyond Persuasion: A Proposal for an Invitational Rhetoric (1995) Communication Monographs, 62 (1), pp. 2-18; Gibson, R.K., Party Change, Social Media and the Rise of ‘Citizen-Initiated’ Campaigning (2015) Party Politics, 21 (2), pp. 183-197; Goodrich, B., Kurkiewicz, D., Rinker, T., (2015) Qdap: Bridging the Gap Between Qualitative Data and Quantitative Analysis, , https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/qdap/index.html, (version 2.2.2); Gronbeck, B.E., The Functions of Presidential Campaigning (1978) Communication Monographs, 45 (4), pp. 268-280; Hallin, D.C., Mancini, P., (2004) Comparing Media Systems: Three Models of Media and Politics, , New York, Cambridge University Press; Hay, C., (2007) Why We Hate Politics, , Malden, MA, Polity; Hindman, M.S., (2009) The Myth of Digital Democracy, , Princeton, Princeton University Press; Howard, P.N., (2006) New Media Campaigns and the Managed Citizen, , New York, Cambridge University Press; European Union Internet Users, Population and Facebook Statistics (2016) ” Available from:, , http://www.internetworldstats.com/stats9.htm, Accessed 15 Jun 2016; Jensen, M.J., Anstead, N., Campaigns and Social Media Communications: A Look at Digital Campaigning in the 2010 U.K. General Election (2014) The Internet and Democracy in Global Perspective, Studies in Public Choice, pp. 57-81. , Grofman Bernard, Trechsel Alexander H., Franklin Mark, (eds), New York, Springer International, ed; Jensen, M.J., Bang, H.P., Occupy Wall Street: A New Political Form of Movement and Community?

A standardized content analysis of text and images in newspaper articles from Brazil, Germany, India, South Africa, and the United States covering the United Nations (UN) Climate Change Conferences 2010–2013 was conducted using a subset of photo-illustrated articles (n = 432) as well as the entire conference coverage (n = 1,311). In the photo-illustrated articles, four overarching multimodal frames were identified: global warming victims, civil society demands, political negotiations, and sustainable energy frames. The distribution of these global frames across the five countries is relatively similar, and a comparison of frames emerging from the national subsets also reveals a strong element of cross-national frame convergence. This is explained by the news production context at global staged political events, which features uniform media access rules and similar information supplies, as well as strong interaction between journalists from different countries and between journalists and other actors. Event-related frame convergence across vastly different contexts is interpreted as one mechanism by which truly transnational media debate can be facilitated that can potentially serve to legitimize global political decisions. In conclusion, perspectives for future qualitative and quantitative multimodal framing research are discussed. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.","comparative research; environment; global news; media framing; news events; newspapers",,,,,,,,,,"Adolphsen, M., (2014) Communication Strategies of Governments and NGOs: Engineering Global Discourse at High-Level International Summits, , Wiesbaden, Springer VS; Adolphsen, M., Lück, J., (2012) Medien & Kommunikationswissenschaft, Special, pp. 141-158. , Non-routine Interactions behind the Scenes of a Global Media Event: How Journalists and Political PR Professionals Co-produced the 2010 UN Climate Conference in Cancun; Bateman, J., (2008) Multimodality and Genre, , Basingstoke, Palgrave Macmillan; Beattie, G., Sale, L., Mcguire, L., An Inconvenient Truth?

Drawing on theories of path dependence and interviews with NGO professionals, this paper identifies three factors that explain why this should be so. First, donors continue to value media coverage as a platform to learn about advocacy groups, as well as a mechanism for measuring their impact on political discourse. Second, political officials still value media coverage as a way to learn about advocacy demands. Third, NGOs occupy a position that is socially proximate to journalism, which leads the former to see the latter as an ally in the pursuit of publicity. Together, these factors confirm and extend the new institutional concept of “path dependence” by demonstrating how path dependence in one field (philanthropy, politics) can reinforce path dependence in another (NGO). These “reinforcing path dependencies” in turn interact with established mechanisms of institutional production (start-up costs, feedback effects, knowledge accumulation) to explain why NGOs continue to persist in media-centered publicity strategies despite new technological possibilities. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.","advocacy; civil society; global news; new institutionalism",,,,,,,,,,"Barnett, M., (2011) Empire of Humanity: A History of Humanitarianism, , Ithaca, NY, Cornell University Press; Bennett, W.L., Segerberg, A., (2013) The Logic of Connective Action, , Cambridge, Cambridge University Press; Benson, R., (2013) Shaping Immigration News, , Cambridge, Cambridge University Press; Benthall, J., (1993) Disasters, Relief and the Media, , London, I.B.

However, the question remains: Has China been successful in enhancing its soft power via its news media expansion in the African region? Although it is easy to find sweeping proclamations regarding the popularity of Chinese media throughout Africa, there have been limited efforts to systematically measure the effect of these media on African public opinion toward China. This study seeks to fill this void. Using Pew Global Attitudes Project data, I explore correlations between attitudes toward China and the extent of the Chinese media presence across six African nations in 2013. In addition, to better test for a causal effect of the post-2006 expansion, I employ a second analysis in which I compare these relationships in 2007 with these same relationships in 2013. By comparing changes in these relationships over time, this analysis provides tentative empirical support that the sweeping efforts undertaken to expand the reach and relevance of Chinese media in Africa have moved African public opinion in the desired direction. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.","Africa; broadcasting news; Central Asia; comparative research; media effects; public opinion",,,,,,,,,,"(2015) About CCTV Africa, , http://cctv-africa.com/about-cctv-africa/; (2011) About China Daily Group, , http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/_e/;about.html; (2012) China Daily Website Media Kit, , http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/ad/html/rate/CDI-Mediakit-ENG201210.pdf; (2015) About China Radio International, , http://www.cri.com; (2014) Introduction to the Confucius Institutes, , http://english.hanban.org/node_10971.htm; (2015) History & Milestones: CRI English Service, , http://english.cri.cn/about/history.htm; (2015) Shortwave Frequencies in Africa, , http://english.cri.cn/7146/2010/03/30/2141s560021.htm; (2015) Chinese State Media Snipe at Obama’s Africa Trip, , http://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-3175914/Chinese-state-media-snipe-Obamas-Africa-trip.html, July, 27; (2006) Forum on China-Africa Cooperation: Beijing Action Plan (2007–2009), , http://www.fmprc.gov.cn/zflt/eng/zyzl/hywj/t280369.htm; Gagliardone, I., China as a Persuader: CCTV Africa’s First Steps in the African Mediasphere (2013) Ecquid Novi: African Journalism Studies, 34 (3), pp. 25-40; Gagliardone, I., Geall, S., China in Africa’s Media and Telecommunications: Cooperation, Connectivity and Control (2014) Norwegian Peacebuilding Resource Centre, , http://www.peacebuilding.no/Themes/Emerging-powers/Publications/China-in-Africa-s-media-and-telecommunications-cooperation-connectivity-and-control, April; Glader, P., (2013) China’s Media Investment In Africa Shows Leadership And Raises Questions, , http://www.forbes.com/sites/berlinschoolofcreativeleadership/2013/07/22/chinas-media-ground-game-in-africa-reveals-the-us-lagging-in-soft-power/#529e67ce3c88, July, 22,.

We quantitatively and qualitatively examine two dominant themes of coverage—news about campaign rallies and horse-race reporting—as both are widely seen in political communication scholarship as symptomatic of a media logic. We draw on a content analysis of BBC, ITV, Sky News, Channel 4, and Channel 5 U.K. national television newscasts and semi-structured interviews with their heads of news and/or senior editors to help interpret how far a media logic was the editorial driving force behind coverage. At face value, our content analysis appears to support the media logic thesis, with all broadcasters—in particular commercial television newscasts—covering more process than policy issues. But our case study questions the antecedents of media logic and shines a light on a political logic that may have remained in the dark in large-scale content analysis studies. In following a political logic, we argue that this promoted the horse-race narrative, and naturalized the parties’ highly stage-managed rallies and walkabouts. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.","election campaign; journalism; news production; opinion polls; political parties; television news",,,,,,,,,,"Adams, J., Ezrow, L., Somer-Topcu, Z., Is Anybody Listening?

As a result, we know far less about other national contexts, including many parliamentary democracies that now hold televised election debates. This article makes two contributions to address this. Theoretically, the study argues that traditional approaches for understanding the development of campaign communication practices (particularly, Americanization and hybridization) are limiting when applied to television debates and instead offers an alternative theoretical approach, the concept of speciation drawn from biological science. This is then applied in the empirical section of the article in a comparative analysis of the evolution of televised election debates in four parliamentary democracies: Australia, Canada, West Germany/Germany, and the United Kingdom. Based on this analysis, the article argues that the logic of parliamentary democracy coupled with more diffuse party systems has created a distinctive type of televised debate, generally more open to smaller parties based on their success at winning seats in the legislature. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.","comparative research; election campaign; parliament; political parties; television debates",,,,,,,,,,"Amber, A., Making the Debates Happen: A Television Producer’s Perspective (2000) Televised Election Debates, pp. 130-156. , Coleman, (ed), London, Hansard Society,.” In, ed; Anstead, N., Social Media and the Debates (2015) The 2015 Televised Election Debates: Democracy on Demand, pp. 41-48. , Coleman, Blumler, Moss, Homer, (eds), Leeds, University of Leeds,.” In, ed; Anstead, N., O’Loughlin, B., The Emerging Viewertariat and BBC Question Time: Television Debate and Real-Time Commenting Online (2011) The International Journal of Press/Politics, 16, pp. 440-462; Baker, K.L., Norpoth, H., Candidates on Television: The 1972 Electoral Debates in West Germany (1981) The Public Opinion Quarterly, 45, pp. 329-345; (2014) Rival Parties’ Anger at TV Debate Offer to Nigel Farage, , www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-29595529, accessed March 1, 2016; Benoit, W.L., (2002) The Primary Decision: A Functional Analysis of Debates in Presidential Primaries, , Westport, CN, Greenwood Publishing Group; Benoit, W.L., Hansen, G., Verser, R., A Meta-analysis of the Effects of Viewing US Presidential Debates (2003) Communication Monographs, 70, pp. 335-350; Benoit, W.L., Henson, J.R., A Functional Analysis of the 2006 Canadian and 2007 Australian Election Debates (2007) Argumentation and Advocacy, 44, pp. 36-48; Berlocher, S.H., Origins: A Brief History of Research on Speciation.

In this context, two types of selective media exposure are relevant. One is selectivity based on political ideological preferences, the other selectivity based on political interest. Evidence for both has been found primarily in an American context, while there is less research on European countries. This is problematic, as the opportunity structures for different forms of selectivity vary across media environments. Against this background, the purpose of this study is to investigate the two types of selective exposure in a country—Sweden—where the opportunity structures for selective exposure differ from the American context. This study investigates both types of selective exposure in relation to televised party-leader interviews. Based on panel survey data, the findings show that selective exposure based on political interest is substantially more important than selective exposure based on ideological preferences in explaining exposure to party-leader interviews. To substantiate this finding, the results are replicated with partisan learning as the dependent variable. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.","media consumption; media environment; polarization; political information; selective exposure",,,,,,,,,,"Aalberg, T., Blekesaune, A., Elvestad, E., Media Choice and Informed Democracy: Toward Increasing News Consumption Gaps in Europe?

In this paper, we scrutinize the relationship between individualization and digital social media in a study that combines the 2013 Norwegian Candidate Survey with candidates’ Twitter data. We ask, first, to what extent are social media used as an individualistic campaign tool? Second, does an individualized social media campaign style increase influence in the Twitter sphere? Third, what constitutes success on Twitter? We found two main styles of social media campaigning: a party-centered and an individualized style. Moreover, an individualized style did increase the possibility of being active on Twitter, but it had a negative effect on Twitter influence. The Twitter influentials are young, male, and relatively centrally placed in their parties. In a hybrid communication system, it appears that the candidates who gain influence in social media are those who are able to create a synergy between traditional media channels and social media. © The Author(s) 2016.","Candidates; Election campaign; Political parties; Social media; Twitter",,,,,,,,,,"Agranof, R., (1972) The New Style in Election Campaigns, , Boston: Holbrook Press,, ed; Allern, E.H., Heidar, K., Karlsen, R., (2016) After the Mass Party, , Lanham: Lexington; Balmas, M., Rahat, G., Sheafer, T., Shenhav, S.R., Two Routes to Personalized Politics: Centralized and Decentralized Personalization (2014) Party Politics, 20 (1), pp. 37-51; Brox, B.J., Shaw, D.R., Political Parties, American Campaigns, and Effects on Outcome (2006) Handbook of Party Politics, pp. 146-159. , London: Sage, In, ed; Bruns, A., How Long Is a Tweet?

In evaluating the shift from traditional to online campaigning techniques, the use of social media’s increasingly visual capabilities has been comparatively neglected in research. This article considers one type of online visual political communication, the online political poster, in terms of its strategic campaign functions relating to persuasive and organizational roles. The article uses a case study of an extensive data set of online political posters collected from political parties in the United Kingdom, on Facebook, between September 2013 through to and including the general election in May 2015, to try to understand how parties used online political posters and how audiences responded to them. The findings show that despite a clear emphasis on sharing images, very few received widespread attention, arguably limiting their persuasive role. However, their prevalence suggests a role relating to parties trying to maintain relationships with existing online supporters as a form of displaying virtual presence, credibility, and belonging, paralleling the function of traditional window posters and yard signs but in a social media setting. © The Author(s) 2016.","Election campaign; New technologies; Political advertising; Political participation; Social media",,,,,,"Economic and Social Research Council, ESRC: ES/N009614/1",,,,"Baldwin-Philippi, J., (2015) Using Technology, Building Democracy, , New York: Oxford University Press; Barnhurst, K.G., Quinn, K., Political Visions: Visual Studies in Political Communication (2012) The Sage Handbook of Political Communication, pp. 276-291. , London: Sage, In, ed; Bartlett, J., Bennett, S., Birnie, R., Wibberley, S., (2013) Virtually Members: The Facebook and Twitter Followers of UK Political Parties, , London: Demos; You Just Shared a Link.

By contrast, we show that political engagement on social media may revitalize party activities because these platforms are means for both party members and ordinary citizens to discuss politics and engage with and around political parties. Using online surveys conducted in Germany, Italy, and the United Kingdom, we find that party members engage in a wider variety of party-related activities than average respondents, but the same can also be said of nonparty members who informally discuss politics on social media. Moreover, the strength of the relationship between party membership and engagement decreases as the intensity of political discussion on social media increases. This suggests that political discussions on social media can narrow the divide in party-related engagement between members and nonmembers, and to some extent flatten rather than reinforce existing political hierarchies. Finally, we find that the correlation between party membership and engagement is stronger in Germany, where party organizations are more robust, than in Italy and the United Kingdom, highlighting the role of party organizational legacies in the digital age. © The Author(s) 2016.","Comparative research; Democracy; Election campaign; Internet; Political participation; Political parties; Social media",,,,,,,,,,"(2015) Standard Definitions: Final Dispositions of Case Codes and Outcome Rates for Surveys, , 8th Edition, Oakbrook Terrace, IL: AAPOR; Anstead, N., Chadwick, A., Parties, Election Campaigning and the Internet: Toward a Comparative Institutional Approach (2009) The Routledge Handbook of Internet Politics, pp. 56-71. , London: Routledge,.” In, ed; Bawn, K., Cohen, M., Karol, D., Masket, S., Noel, H., Zaller, J., A Theory of Political Parties: Groups, Policy Demands and Nominations in American Politics (2012) Perspectives on Politics, 10 (3), pp. 571-597; Blais, A., Turnout in Elections (2007) The Oxford Handbook of Political Behavior, pp. 621-635. , Oxford: Oxford University Press,.” In, ed; Chadwick, A., Digital Network Repertoires and Organizational Hybridity (2007) Political Communication, 24 (3), pp. 283-301; Chadwick, A., Web 2.0: New Challenges for the Study of E-Democracy in an Era of Informational Exuberance (2009) I/S: Journal of Law and Policy for the Information Society, 5 (1), pp. 9-41; Coleman, S., The Lonely Citizen: Indirect Representation in an Age of Networks (2005) Political Communication, 22 (2), pp. 197-214; Dalton, R.J., Cognitive Mobilization and Partisan Dealignment in Advanced Industrial Democracies (1984) The Journal of Politics, 46 (1), pp. 264-284; Edwards, A., ICT Strategies of Democratic Intermediaries: A View on the Political System in the Digital Age (2006) Information Polity, 11 (2), pp. 163-176; Enos, R.D., Hersh, E.D., Party Activists as Campaign Advertisers: The Ground Campaign as a Principal-Agent Problem (2015) American Political Science Review, 1 (2), pp. 252-278; Gibson, R., Party Change, Social Media and the Rise of ‘Citizen-Initiated’ Campaigning (2015) Party Politics, 21 (2), pp. 183-197; Gibson, R., Cantijoch, M., Conceptualizing and Measuring Participation in the Age of the Internet: Is Online Political Engagement Really Different to Offline?

In the Spanish National Elections in December 2015, this party obtained 20.66 percent of the votes, which made it the third biggest party. Our objective was to analyze the old and new elements of Podemos’ communication and campaign strategies. The methodology followed here used this new party as a strategic case study by a qualitative approach. The analysis focused on three key fronts: (1) the role of communication, (2) mediatization of politics, and (3) use of digital media. The results suggested that Podemos’ 2014 electoral campaign combined presence on broadcast television and use of intense digital media to boost citizens’ engagement and self-mediation. Accordingly, it was established as a new transmedia party. This case also demonstrates that mediatization can also occur in two-way street dynamics, that is, from politics to the media, where the former generates an influence on the latter. This finding opens the door to help overcome the media-centric vision. Finally, we discussed future questions about the influence on other political actors’ communication strategies in different parts of the world from an international perspective. © The Author(s) 2016.","Electoral campaign; Internet; New technologies; Political parties",,,,,,,,,,"Bennett, W.L., Iyengar, S., A New Era of Minimal Effects?

We test this hypothesis in a nonwestern campaign context. We discuss India’s complex “hybrid media system,” political parties, leaders, and issues in the 2014 national election that saw more use of digital information channels by all parties, and more so by the opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the young Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) than the incumbent Indian National Congress (INC). We hypothesize that online engagement and, specifically, sharing of campaign information is a significant predictor of political engagement in the campaigns of each of these three parties. Our dependent variable is a scale of engagement in campaign activities. Independent variables include campaign interest, issue salience, exposure to outdoor party publicity, attention to political information in various traditional media, party contact and sharing information with others (both measured face-to-face and electronically), and controlling for age, gender, and education. Our models, based on survey data from Delhi, Bengaluru, and Mumbai, show that party contact, sharing campaign information, and campaign interest are significant predictors of engagement while the other items vary in terms of significance. © The Author(s) 2016.","Election campaign; India; Internet; Media effects; Political participation; Political parties",,,,,,,,,,"Baishya, A.K., #NaMo: The Political Work of the Selfie in the 2014 Indian General Election (2015) International Journal of Communication, 28 (9), pp. 1686-1700; Beaver, L., Google Has Massive Plans for India in 2016 (2015) Business Insider, , http://www.businessinsider.com/google-has-massive-plans-for-india-in-2016-2015-12, December, accessed December 22, 2015; Bennett, L.W., Iyengar, S., A New Era of Minimal Effects?

Based on observations and in-depth interviews with key personnel in the campaigns of six of the parties running for Parliament, I examine whether German campaigns’ use of digital tools follows the usage practices that have been identified in studies of campaigns in the United States. I group how campaigns use digital tools into four categories: organizational structures and work routines, presence in information spaces online, support in resource collection and allocation, and symbolic uses. I show that these categories capture how German parties use digital tools. U.S.-based studies can thus provide helpful interpretive frameworks for studying digital campaigning in other countries. However, I also reveal that there are important differences between German and U.S.-based online campaigning. These differences stem from the different levels of intensity with which digital tools are deployed in each country. © The Author(s) 2016.","Bundestagswahl 2013; Campaign innovation; Campaigns; Digital tools; Election campaigns; Germany; Internet; Online campaigning; Parties",,,,,,,,,,"Anstead, N., Chadwick, A., Parties, Election Campaigning, and the Internet: Toward a Comparative Institutional Approach (2009) Routledge Handbook of Internet Politics, pp. 56-71. , London: Routledge, In, ed; Anstead, N., O’Loughlin, B., Social Media Analysis and Public Opinion: The 2010 UK General Election (2014) Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication, , http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jcc4.12102/abstract, accessed May 4, 2015; Bennett, W.L., Segerberg, A., (2013) The Logic of Connective Action: Digital Media and the Personalization of Contentious Politics, , New York: Cambridge University Press; Berry, J.M., Validity and Reliability Issues in Elite Interviewing (2002) Political Science & Politics, 35 (4), pp. 679-682; Bimber, B., (2003) Information and American Democracy: Technology in the Evolution of Political Power, , Cambridge: Cambridge University Press; Bimber, B., Davis, R., (2003) Campaigning Online: The Internet in U.S. Elections, , Oxford: Oxford University Press; Bimber, B., Flanagin, A., Stohl, C., (2012) Collective Action in Organizations: Interaction and Engagement in an Era of Technological Change, , New York: Cambridge University Press; Chadwick, A., Britain’s First Live Televised Party Leaders’ Debate: From the News Cycle to the Political Information Cycle (2011) Parliamentary Affairs, 64 (1), pp. 24-44; Chadwick, A., (2013) The Hybrid Media System: Politics and Power, , Oxford: Oxford University Press; Cogburn, D.L., Espinoza-Vasquez, F.K., From Networked Nominee to Networked Nation: Examining the Impact of Web 2.0 and Social Media on Political Participation and Civic Engagement in the 2008 Obama Campaign (2011) Journal of Political Marketing, 10 (1-2), pp. 189-213; Earl, J., Kimport, K., (2011) Digitally Enabled Social Change: Activism in the Internet Age, , Cambridge: MIT Press; Edelman Trust Barometer (2015) Barometer, , http://www.edelman.com/insights/intellectual-property/2015-edelman-trust-barometer/, accessed May 4, 2015; Esser, F., Strömbäck, J., Comparing Election Campaign Communication (2012) Handbook of Comparative Communication Research, pp. 289-307. , Oxon: Routledge, In, ed; Farrell, H., Drezner, D.W., The Power and Politics of Blogs (2007) Public Choice, 134 (1-2), pp. 15-30; Foot, K.A., Schneider, S.M., (2006) Web Campaigning, , Boston: MIT Press; Geber, S., Scherer, H., My Voter, My Party, and Me: American and German Parliamentarians on Facebook (2015) Journal of Information Technology & Politics, , http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/19331681.2015.1101037, accessed December 16, 2015; Gibson, R.K., Party Change, Social Media and the Rise of ‘Citizen-Initiated’ Campaigning (2015) Party Politics, 21 (2), pp. 183-197; Gibson, R.K., Margolis, M., Resnick, D., Ward, S., Election Campaigning on the WWW in the USA and UK: A Comparative Analysis (2003) Party Politics, 9 (1), pp. 47-75; Hallin, D.C., Mancini, P., (2004) Comparing Media Systems: Three Models of Media and Politics, , New York: Cambridge University Press; Hamby, P., Did Twitter Kill the Boys on the Bus?

Two publications from each nation, one conservative and one progressive, are content analyzed for adherence to a series of marginalization devices that have often been used by the U.S. media to ridicule protest movements and portray them as violent. The Indian media emerge as the least likely to follow the protest paradigm, while Brazilian and Chinese media conform to it in moderate levels. Comparative analysis suggests the historical legitimacy of informal power negotiations in a political culture makes news media more willing to take protesters seriously and limits adherence to the protest paradigm. In contrast, a news organization’s ideological affiliation with the government of the day, rather than any ideology per se, makes it relatively more likely to conform to the protest paradigm. Marginalization devices such as circus, appearance, and eyewitness accounts are rarely used in any of these nations.

For this, we use E.D. Hirsch’s distinction between the meaning of a text—which refers to the author’s intentions—and its significance—which emphasizes the contexts of production and reception. Critics focused mostly on significance, defenders on meaning. Using this distinction, we first examine the rhetoric of cartoons: stereotypes linked to antisemitism (accusations of deicide and blood libel), use of the Star of David as metonym of Israel, disputed historical analogies (between Israeli policy and Nazism or Apartheid). Second, we analyze four levels of contextual interpretations that have framed the debates: the cartoon as genre, the ethotic arguments about the cartoonist and/or newspaper’s track record, the cartoons’ historical and transnational intertextuality (especially with the Arab press), and the issue of audiences’ sensitivities. We analyze the complex exchanges of arguments that led mostly to a dialogue of the deaf, but also, in some cases, to partial agreement on the offensive character of the cartoons. We conclude that this methodology can be applied to other controversies around popular political texts, which offer similar characteristics. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.","freedom of the press; globalization; journalism; media audiences; Middle East; political cartoons",,,,,,,,,,"(2004) Antisémitisme: l’OSCE appelle le monde politique et civil à se mobiliser, p. 28; (2004) Charansky.

The idea is that independent news media will facilitate free and fair elections and shine a spotlight on corruption—thereby serving as a fourth estate. Yet political leaders often justify restricting media freedom on the grounds that irresponsible news coverage will incite political violence—potentially undermining government and in effect acting as a fifth column. So is media freedom a force for democracy or a source of civil conflict? We hypothesize that the effect of media freedom on civil conflict is conditioned by a country’s level of intolerance. Specifically, we predict when social intolerance is low, media freedom will discourage domestic conflict because the tone of the news coverage will reflect the level of tolerance and ameliorate any inflammatory coverage. In contrast, we predict that high levels of social intolerance will fuel and be fueled by inflammatory news coverage if the media are free, thereby promoting civil conflict. We test our hypotheses across countries and over time drawing from World Values and European Values Surveys and the Global Media Freedom Dataset and find that the combination of media freedom and high social intolerance is associated with increased civil conflict. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.","Asia; censorship; freedom of the press; media effects; peace; political conflict",,,,,,,,,,"Achen, C.H., (2000) Why Lagged Dependent Variables Can Suppress the Explanatory Power of Other Independent Variables., , Presented at the annual meeting of the Political Methodology Society, Los Angeles:; Alexis, M., Mpambara, I., (2003) IMS Assessment Mission: The Rwanda Media Experience from the Genocide., , Copenhagen: International Media Suort; Bailard, C.S., Ethnic Conflict Goes Mobile: Mobile Technology’s Effect on the Opportunities and Motivations for Violent Collective Action (2015) Journal of Peace Research, 52 (3), pp. 323-337; Bartusevicius, H., Introducing the Categorically Disaggregated Conflict (CDC) Dataset (2016) Conflict Management and Peace Science, 33 (1), pp. 89-110; Benmelech, E., Berrebi, C., Klor, E., (2010) Counter-Suicide-Terrorism: Evidence from House Demolitions., , http://www.nber.org/papers/w16493, October,, NBER Working Paper 16493,,. :; Bennett, W.L., Lawrence, R.G., Livingston, S., (2007) When the Press Fails: Political Power and the News Media from Iraq to Katrina, , Chicago: University of Chicago Press; Berman, E., Callen, M., Felter, J.H., Shapiro, J.N., Do Working Men Rebel?

However, studies have also shown that this political agenda-setting effect is not automatic. The present study conceptualizes the media’s influence on politics as a function of the media message and the background of politicians and focuses on the moment a member of parliament (MP) learns about an issue through a news report. What aspects of a news report make politicians take action? And are some politicians more likely to take action than others? It introduces an innovative factorial survey experiment to isolate media effects by asking Swiss politicians (N = 50) to evaluate fictional news reports. Analyses show that news reports on an issue their party owns covering a negative development published in a quality newspaper are more likely to lead to action. However, negative news mainly affects junior MPs. In contrast to previous studies, issue specialization of the MP does not have a significant effect. Findings are discussed in light of the role of the political system and the power of the media in politics. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.","media effects; parliament; political agenda-setting",,,,,,,,,,"Andeweg, R., Thomassen, J., Pathways to Party Unity: Sanctions, Loyalty, Homogeneity and Division of Labour in the Dutch Parliament (2010) Party Politics, 17 (5), pp. 655-672; Bartels, L.M., Messages Received: The Political Impact of Media Exposure (1993) American Political Science Review, 87 (2), pp. 267-285; Blum, R., Donges, P., (2005) Politischer Journalismus in der Schweiz, , Berne: Haupt Verlag; Brandenburg, H., Who Follows Whom?

Attacks by one side induce counterattacks by the other. Yet most research on the interactive nature of negative campaigning is limited to two-party competition and provides little theoretical justification for why political actors should respond to attacks with counterattacks. The present paper addresses these research gaps. We argue that the negativity bias in human information processing and the zero-sum nature of elections make retaliation a rational strategy. Importantly, these arguments also imply that retaliation may not be the only plausible response to attacks in multiparty systems. Rather, parties may prefer to react to attacks from one competitor by attacking another. To grasp empirically how being attacked and attacking are related, we conduct a highly disaggregated time series analysis of such instances while controlling for other factors that may influence actor behavior. Our analyses draw on several thousand party press releases issued during three national election campaigns in Austria, a typical European multiparty system.

Yet in such context, parties do not exclusively follow a tit-for-tat approach but rather display more complex patterns of attack behavior. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.","Austria; multiparty competition; negative campaigning; political communication",,,,,,,,,,"Ansolabehere, S., Iyengar, S., (1995) Going Negative.

Epistemologically, there are several systematic ways to build typologies, such as qualitative, theory-based descriptions on one end and quantitative, exploratory statistical means on the other end of the spectrum. Both have their specific advantages and disadvantages, which can be bridged by applying set-theoretic methods, such as Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA). The contribution of this paper is substantial and methodological: First, we show how QCA can enhance our understanding of media systems by building a typology that draws on Hallin and Mancini’s framework. The main improvement of QCA is the ability to identify ideal types as well as border cases. In our analysis, we move beyond the widely discussed case of Great Britain and take a closer look at further border cases such as Austria, Belgium, France, the Netherlands, and Portugal. Second, QCA has been scarcely applied to build typologies and if so, only in neighboring disciplines. Thus, we aim at familiarizing comparative political communication scholars with this method. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.","international comparative research; journalism; media systems; methodology; qualitative comparative analysis (QCA); typologies",,,,,,,,,,"Anagnostou, D., Avădani, I., Smith, R.C., Docquir, P.-F., Gusy, C., Harro-Loit, H., Kuutti, H., Van Besien, B., (2012) Media Freedom and Independence in 14 European Countries: A Comparative Perspective, , http://www.mediadem.eliamep.gr/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/D3.1.pdf; Bailey, K.D., (1994) Typologies and Taxonomies: An Introduction to Classification Techniques, , London: Sage; Brüggemann, M., Engesser, S., Büchel, F., Humprecht, E., Castro, L., Hallin and Mancini Revisited: Four Empirical Types of Western Media Systems (2014) Journal of Communication, 64 (6), pp. 1037-1065; Brüggemann, M., Königslöw, K.K.-V., Explaining Cosmopolitan Coverage (2013) European Journal of Communication, 28 (4), pp. 361-378; Collier, D., Porte, J.L., Seawright, J., Typologies: Forming Concepts and Creating Categorical Variables (2008) The Oxford Handbook of Political Methodology, pp. 152-173. , Oxford: Oxford University Press,, In,, ed; Cornia, A., Will Italian Political Journalism Ever Change?

This study explores how three types of media bias (visibility bias, tonality bias, and agenda bias) affect voter assessments of politicians’ traits. Bias effects should be stronger for political traits (such as competence) than for nonpolitical traits (such as likability). Biases may also interact in their effects: Specifically, visibility bias should moderate the impact of tonality bias. Combining media, party, and survey data through manual content analysis of newspaper coverage (N = 2,680) and party press releases (N = 1,794), as well as a three-wave voter survey (n = 927) during the 2013 Austrian election campaign, we find substantial effects of tonality bias and agenda bias on political trait perceptions. The effects are less clear for nonpolitical trait perceptions. Although visibility bias has no direct impact, there is evidence that it moderates effects of tonality bias on candidate perceptions. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.","election campaign; media bias; media effects; political perceptions",,,,,,"Austrian Science Fund, FWF: S10908-G11

Based on Freedom House data, these countries are characterized by different levels of press freedom. A large corpus of newspaper articles (107,248 articles) from the period 2004 to 2013 were analyzed using dedicated software. We demonstrate that freedom of press is not the only dimension that affects the ability to and the way in which news media report on corruption. Because of its political partisanship, the Italian press tends to emphasize and dramatize corruption cases involving domestic public administrators and, in particular, politicians. The British coverage is affected mainly by market factors, and the press pays more attention to cases occurring abroad and in sport. The French coverage shares specific features with both the British and the Italian coverage: Newspapers mainly focus on corruption involving business companies and foreign actors, but they also cover cases involving domestic politicians. Media market segmentation, political parallelism, and media instrumentalization determine different representations preventing the establishment of unanimously shared indignation. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.","comparative research; corruption; freedom of the press; media coverage; partisan journalism",,,,,,,,,,"Benson, R., (2013) Shaping Immigration News, , Cambridge, Cambridge University Press; Besley, T., Burgess, R., Political Agency, Government Responsiveness and the Role of the Media (2001) European Economic Review, 45 (4), pp. 629-640; Blumler, J.G., McLeod, J.M., Rosengren, K.E., (1992) Comparative Speaking: Communication and Culture across Space and Time, , Newbury Park, Sage; Boeri, T., Severgnini, B., (2008) The Italian Job: Match Rigging, Career Concerns and Media Concentration in ‘Serie A.’, , http://ftp.iza.org/dp3745.pdf, accessed August 28, 2015, ” IZA Discussion Paper No. 3745; Brunetti, A., Weder, B., A Free Press Is Bad News for Corruption (2003) Journal of Public Economics, 87 (7-8), pp. 1801-1824; Chowdhury, S.K., The Effect of Democracy and Press Freedom on Corruption: An Empirical Test (2004) Economics Letters, 85 (1), pp. 93-101; Ciaglia, A., Politics in the Media and the Media in Politics: A Comparative Study of the Relationship between the Media and Political Systems in Three European Countries (2013) European Journal of Communication, 28 (5), pp. 541-555; Curran, J., Seaton, J., (1997) Power without Responsibility, , London, Routledge; Davis, A., (2007) The Mediation of Power, , London, Routledge; Diamond, L., Morlino, L., (2005) Assessing the Quality of Democracy, , Baltimore, Johns Hopkins University Press, eds; Fiorino, N., Galli, E., Petrarca, I., (2013) Press and Corruption in the Italian Regions: An Empirical Test, , http://www.siecon.org/online/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Fiorino-Galli-Petrarca-83.pdf, Presented at SIEP Conference, Pavia, Italy, accessed August 28, 2015; Freille, S., Hacque, M.E., Kneller, R., A Contribution to the Empirics of Press Freedom and Corruption (2007) European Journal of Political Economy, 23 (4), pp. 838-862; Gounev, P., Ruggiero, V., (2012) Corruption and Organized Crime in Europe: Illegal Partnerships, , London, Routledge; Grigorescu, A., The Corruption Eruption in East-Central Europe: The Increased Salience of Corruption and the Role of Intergovernmental Organizations (2006) Eastern European Politics and Society, 20 (3), pp. 516-549; Hallin, D.C., Mancini, P., (2004) Comparing Media Systems: Three Models of Media and Politics, , Cambridge, Cambridge University Press; Hallin, D.C., Papathanassopoulos, S., Political Clientelism and the Media: Southern Europe and Latin America in Comparative Perspective (2002) Media, Culture & Society, 24 (2), pp. 175-195; Heywood, P.M., Integrity Management and the Public Service Ethos in the UK: Patchwork Quilt or Threadbare Blanket?

However, prior research has scarcely considered the intersectional effects of political actors’ race and gender in this context. I investigate these dynamics through a case study of the U.K. 2010 general election, a breakthrough year for black, Asian, and minority ethnic (BAME) women in British politics. Only three had previously been elected to parliament but a further seven joined their ranks that year. While headlines celebrated the possibility of a “small revolution” resulting in “the most diverse parliament ever,” the press also subjected BAME female candidates to exceptional scrutiny regarding their credentials and ability to “transform politics.” Employing a quantitative content analysis of national newspaper coverage, I find that the apparent newsworthiness of BAME women’s intersectional identity was a double-edged sword. While they arguably enjoyed a visibility advantage compared with white female candidates, their coverage was also exceptionally negative and narrowly focused on their ethnicity and gender. I argue that as national legislatures become increasingly diverse, single axis analyses of the effects of politicians’ race, gender, or other axes of identity are insufficient to capture their combined effects on press coverage of politics. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.","election campaign; ethnicity; gender; media framing; newspapers; race",,,,,,,,,,"Adcock, C., The Politician, the Wife, the Citizen, and Her Newspaper (2010) Feminist Media Studies, 10 (2), pp. 135-159; Audickas, L., Richard, C., Wood, J., (2016) Ethnic Minorities in Politics and Public Life, , www.parliament.uk/briefing-papers/sn01156.pdf, ” House of Commons Briefing Paper Number SN01156: 7; Banwart, M.C., Bystrom, D.G., Robertson, T., From the Primary to the General Election: A Comparative Analysis of Candidate Media Coverage in Mixed-Gender 2000 Races for Governor and U.S. Senate (2003) American Behavioral Scientist, 46 (5), pp. 658-676; Barber, J.T., Gandy, O.H., Press Portrayal of African American and White United States Representatives (1990) Howard Journal of Communications, 2 (2), pp. 213-225; Bates, S., Diary: First Principle of Turfing Out a Celeb-Saint with a 15,000 Majority?

What are the effects of multiple versus single media frames on a foreign policy issue, and how do they interact with people’s foreign policy values? Previous studies have looked at how single frames influence opinions, how frames interact with values, and a few studies have investigated the effects of two competing frames at varying levels of persuasiveness. None, however, have used four, equally strong frames on a foreign policy issue and measured their effects among those with differing foreign policy values. We found that exposure to only single frames tended to move participants away from their stated values and in the direction of the frame, while exposure to multiple, competing frames kept participants’ opinions closer to their stated values—without merely reinforcing previously held opinions. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.","Eastern Europe; foreign news; journalistic norms; media effects; media framing; political attitudes",,,,,,,,,,"(2016) Supreme Court of the United States. 1919.

Most studies of media-politics focus on majoritarian parliamentary or presidential systems and on how party systems affect journalism. This tends to neglect important issues that pertain in more constitutionally complex democracies, such as the consociational institutions in postconflict societies. Taking the Northern Irish context as a strategic case study, we analyze data from thirty-three semistructured interviews with the actors responsible for communicating political issues in Northern Ireland: political journalists and the two groups of government communicators, civil service Government Information Officers (GIOs) and Ministerial Special Advisers (SpAds). By examining their roles and relationships in this context, we demonstrate the importance of considering the institutional design of the democratic system itself when attempting to develop a more comprehensive and nuanced theory of media-politics. In Northern Ireland, the absence of an official political opposition in the legislature, together with the mandatory nature of the multiparty coalition, means that the media have come to be perceived by many political and media actors as the opposition. This in turn influences the interpersonal interactions between government and media, the way political actors try to “manage” the media, and the media’s approach to reporting government. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.","democracy; government; journalism; peace; political conflict; public sphere",,,,,,,,,,"Andeweg, R.B., Consociational Democracy (2000) Annual Review of Political Science, 3 (1), pp. 509-536; Armoudian, M., Constructing ‘the Others’ during Conflict: How Journalism’s Norms and Structures Temper Extreme Portrayals (2015) The International Journal of Press/Politics, 20 (3), pp. 360-381; Aroussi, S., Vandeginste, S., De Feyter, K., Law, Power-Sharing and Human Rights (2013) The International Journal of Human Rights, 17 (2), pp. 179-182; Avraham, E., Press, Politics, and the Coverage of Minorities in Divided Societies (2003) The International Journal of Press/Politics, 8 (4), pp. 7-26; Baker, S., ”The Alternative Press in Northern Ireland and the Political Process (2005) Journalism Studies, 6 (3), pp. 375-386; Bennett, W.L., Toward a Theory of Press-State Relations in the United States (1990) Journal of Communication, 40 (2), pp. 103-127; Birrell, D., (2012) Comparing Devolved Governance, , Basingstoke, Palgrave Macmillan; Çarkoğlu, A., Baruh, L., Yildirum, K., Press-Party Parallelism and Polarization of News Media during an Election Campaign: The Case of the 2011 Turkish Elections (2014) The International Journal of Press/Politics, 19 (3), pp. 295-317; Cook, T., The News Media as a Political Institution: Looking Backward and Looking Forward (2006) Political Communication, 23 (2), pp. 159-171; Davis, A., (2007) The Mediation of Power, , Oxon, Routledge; Davis, A., Journalist-Source Relations, Mediated Reflexivity and the Politics of Politics (2009) Journalism Studies, 10 (2), pp. 204-219; Davis, A., (2010) Political Communication and Social Theory, , Oxon, Routledge; De Albuquerque, A., On Models and Margins (2011) Comparing Media Systems Beyond the Western World, pp. 72-95. , Hallin Daniel C., Mancini Paolo, (eds), Cambridge, Cambridge University Press,.” In, ed.,; Deuze, M., What Is Journalism?

The region is plagued by “mini-Murdochs,” and Bulgaria is a case in point. This study investigates a subset of Bulgarian online newspaper readers’ perceptions of the state of journalism. The article presents the results from a qualitative analysis of 1,583 comments about the media war between the country’s biggest press groups. It focuses on 178 comments that discuss the role of journalists. Readers differentiate between “ideal journalism” and “real journalism.” The former is based on an idealized view of journalists as detached watchdogs, whereas the latter depicts a dire picture of journalists as manipulative servants of their owners. The virtual space is a vibrant arena for democratic discussions and can also potentially serve as an accountability tool for journalists. A reconceptualization of Habermas’s public sphere is needed if we are to more clearly understand how vibrant online spaces contribute to democracy even if they fall short of his normative ideal. © 2015, © The Author(s) 2015.","Eastern Europe; journalism; media ownership; online comments; reader opinion; “mini-Murdochs”",,,,,,,,,,"Bergström, A., The Reluctant Audience: Online Participation in the Swedish Journalistic Context (2008) Westminster Papers in Communication and Culture, 5 (2), pp. 60-79; Chung, D., How Readers Perceive Journalists’ Functions at Online Community Newspapers (2009) Newspaper Research Journal, 30 (1), pp. 72-80; Coman, M., Media Bourgeoisie and Media Proletariat in Post-communist Romania (2004) Journalism Studies, 5 (1), pp. 45-58; Coman, M., Journalistic Elites in Post-communist Romania (2010) Journalism Studies, 11 (4), pp. 587-595; Dahlberg, L., The Internet and Democratic Discourse: Exploring the Prospects of Online Deliberative Forums Extending the Public Sphere (2001) Information, Communication & Society, 4 (4), pp. 615-633; Dahlgren, P., The Internet, Public Spheres, and Political Communication: Dispersion and Deliberation (2005) Political Communication, 22 (2), pp. 147-162; Dobek-Ostrowska, B., Italianization (or Mediterraneanization) of the Polish Media System?

At the same time, the transition from low-choice to high-choice media environments suggests that the relationship might not be stable across time. Whatever the linkages between news media use and political distrust were in the 1980s, 1990s, or 2000s, it cannot a priori be assumed that those linkages are the same or of equal strength today. Against this background, the purpose of this paper is to investigate the changing relationship between news media use and political trust across time.

Still missing is an examination of how and to what degree do actions performed by such bodies help define the way journalists report on ongoing conflicts. We claim that in the absence of credible state actors to rely on for information during conflict, journalists will turn to statements made by international bodies as alternative sources of authority to shape their reporting. This study uses framing theory to examine how the United Nations General Assembly and the International Court of Justice (ICJ) became the primary definers for the international media during its coverage of the Israeli–West Bank separation barrier. Using a combination of qualitative and quantitative content analysis, we examine the major news items related to the barrier that appeared between the years 2002 and 2011 in four leading newspapers in the United States and the United Kingdom (New York Times, Washington Post, Guardian, and the Times). We determine what main media frames were being used during coverage of the barrier and point to the drastic change that occurred in their dominance following actions performed by the ICJ. © 2015, © The Author(s) 2015.","framing theory;

Taking the annual United Nations climate change conferences as a case in point, we show that the exceptional circumstances of these events foster a temporary blurring of the professional boundaries between both actor groups that partly results in a joint production of interpretations. Based on seventy-eight semi-standardized interviews with journalists and NGO representatives, we identify four distinct coproduction networks that pair particular types of journalists and NGO communicators. Our analysis shows that (1) the journalistic beat, (2) the type of media journalists work for, (3) journalists’ and NGOs’ perceived target audiences, and also (4) the NGOs’ strategic orientation toward either lobbying or popular mobilization are decisive for the formation of these networks. Our study helps to systematically explain message production in a transnational context and provides a deeper understanding of the relationship between journalism and public relations. © 2015, © The Author(s) 2015.","environment; global news; journalism; news events; news production; social movements",,,,,,"Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG

Data show that similar to journalism in Western democracies, throughout the twenty-one years under study, journalists relied upon official sources, allowed politicians to set the news agenda, and eschewed civil society in favor of representing citizens as voiceless individuals. However, news frames changed during the protest period in unexpected ways given current understandings of the press and civil society. During the protest period, the press framed a greater percentage of coverage as issues and offered contextualization while continuing to privilege official sources, defer agenda setting to politicians, and disregard collective organizations. Based on research elsewhere, issue frames and context may reorient causal attribution for social problems and encourage greater participation. Shortly after the study period, reform topped the political agenda, and disputed policies were overhauled. Connecting content to protests through time sequencing, findings suggest rethinking the relationship between civil society visibility in the press and processes of social accountability. They also provide an example of how legacies of authoritarianism may affect the press under democracy, helping advance theories of press performance beyond experiences in the West. © 2015, © The Author(s) 2015.","civil society; democracy; journalism; Latin America; political participation",,,,,,"Fondo Nacional de Desarrollo CientÃ­fico y TecnolÃ³gico, FONDECYT: 1110009","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: Research for this article received funding from Fondecyt (Chile) Grant No. 1110009.",,,"Aalberg, T., Strömbäck, J., de Vreese, C.H., The Framing of Politics as Strategy and Game: A Review of Concepts, Operationalizations and Key Findings (2012) Journalism, 13 (2), pp. 162-178; Aguero, F., Chile: Unfinished Transition and Increased Political Competition (2003) Constructing Democratic Governance in Latin America, pp. 292-320. , Dominguez J., Shifter M., (eds), Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press,.” In,, ed; Bennett, W.L., Toward a Theory of Press-State Relations in the United States (1990) Journal of Communication, 40 (2), pp. 103-125; Bennett, W.L., Lawrence, R.G., Livingston, S., None Dare Call It Torture: Indexing and the Limits of Press Independence in the Abu Ghraib Scandal (2006) Journal of Communication, 56 (3), pp. 467-485; Benson, R., Hallin, D.C., How States, Markets and Globalization Shape the News: The French and US National Press, 1965-97 (2007) European Journal of Communication, 22 (1), pp. 27-48; Bonner, M.D., Media As Social Accountability: The Case of Police Violence in Argentina (2009) The International Journal of Press/Politics, 14 (3), pp. 296-312; Boyle, M.P., McCluskey, M.R., McLeod, D.M., Stein, S.E., Newspapers and Protest: An Examination of Protest Coverage from 1960 to 1999 (2005) Journalism & Mass Communication Quarterly, 82 (3), pp. 638-653; Bresnahan, R., The Media and the Neoliberal Transition in Chile: Democratic Promise Unfulfilled (2003) Latin American Perspectives, 30 (6), pp. 39-68; Cammaerts, B., Mattoni, A., McCurdy, P., (2013) Mediation and Protest Movements., , Chicago: University of Chicago Press,,, eds; De Vreese, C.H., Semetko, H.A., Cynical and Engaged: Strategic Campaign Coverage, Public Opinion, and Mobilization in a Referendum (2002) Communication Research, 29 (6), pp. 615-641; Entman, R.M., Rojecki, A., Freezing Out the Public: Elite and Media Framing of the U.S. Anti-nuclear Movement (1993) Political Communication, 10, pp. 155-173; Fernandez, A., Vera, M., The Bachelet Presidency and the End of Chile’s Concertación Era (2012) Latin American Perspectives, 39 (4), pp. 5-18; Gamson, W.A., (1990) The Strategy of Social Protest, , 2nd Edition., Belmont: Wadsworth; Guerrero, M.A., Márquez, M., (2014) Media Systems and Communication Policies in Latin America, , New York: Palgrave Macmillan,,, eds; Hagopian, F., Chile and Brazil (2005) In Assessing the Quality of Democracy, pp. 123-162. , Diamond L.J., Morlino L., (eds), Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press,,, eds; Hallin, D., La Nota Roja: Popular Journalism and the Transition to Democracy in Mexico (2000) Tabloid Tales: Global Debates over Media Standards, pp. 267-284. , Sparks C., Tulloch J., (eds), London: Rowman & Littlefield,.” In,, ed; Hallin, D.C., Mancini, P., (2004) Comparing Media Systems: Three Models of Media and Politics, , Cambridge: Cambridge University Press; Hughes, S., (2006) Newsrooms in Conflict: Journalism and the Democratization of Mexico, , Pittsburgh: Pittsburgh University Press; Iyengar, S., How Television News Affects Voters: From Setting Agendas to Defining Standards (1992) Notre Dame Journal of Law, Ethics & Public Policy, 6 (1), pp. 33-44; Iyengar, S., (1994) Is Anyone Responsible?

In contrast to the kind of predetermined “information needs” upon which most debate effects’ studies have been based, the authors set out to ask citizens to explain what kind of democratic capabilities they hoped to derive from watching televised election debates. Through group deliberation within twelve focus groups, participants articulated five broad capabilities that they felt entitled to realize as viewers of televised election debates. Comprising the first stage of a larger project, which is developing an open-source, web-based platform that incorporates a suite of visualization tools that will help citizens make sense of televised political debates, the research reported here attempts to outline what such debates would be like if they were designed from the perspective of citizens rather than political elites. © 2015, © The Author(s) 2015.","capabilities; citizenship; democracy; entitlements; information needs; televised debates",,,,,,"Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, EPSRC: EP/L003112/1

This rapid evolution implies that traditional notions on the presence of gender bias in media reporting need to be re-assessed. Relying on data from more than six thousand full newscasts, we examine the allotted speaking time to members of parliament (MPs) from 2003 until 2011 in the two main television news broadcasts in the Dutch-speaking region of Belgium. Multilevel regression analyses were conducted to determine which factors influence the probability and volume of television news coverage of MPs. The results indicate that—even controlling for alternative explanations—news media persist in a biased treatment of female MPs: Female MPs are significantly less likely to be allotted speaking time, and they receive less speaking time than their male colleagues. Moreover, results show that this gap in media coverage is present especially for elite and thus newsworthy positions. Apparently, gender bias in the media persists, even when the political system evolves rapidly toward equal representation. © 2015, The Author(s) 2015.","Belgium; descriptive representation; gender bias; media bias theory; multilevel analysis; news media; television news",,,,,,"European Research Council, ERC

With a cross-national perspective on a sixty-year time span, it is well suited to examine the long-term development of mediatization. It focuses on news media logic and its components that have not been satisfyingly investigated by empirical research yet. In Step 1, the study empirically identifies three components of media logic: partisanship, personalization, and detachment from policy. In Step 2, it presents evidence that these components are largely invariant between the two countries, seven newspapers, and four time intervals investigated, pointing to the institutional nature of media logic. In Step 3, it shows that the components have developed erratically over time, which contests the idea of mediatization as an incessant, general process. Altogether, the results call for a more nuanced picture of mediatization and a systematic examination of factors interrupting, reverting, or accelerating its long-term development. © 2015, The Author(s) 2015.","Austria; campaign coverage; comparative research; content analysis; Germany; longitudinal analysis; media logic; mediatization",,,,,,"Austrian Science Fund, FWF

Theoretically, the paper integrates research on the sources of public opinion perception and empirically draws on a representative survey carried out before the 2013 German federal election. We show that the perceived media slant and opinions perceived in one’s personal surroundings are closely related to perceptions of party popularity, whereas individual recall of poll results and personal opinions about the parties are not. However, poll results are shown to be the single most important predictor of expectations about the parties’ future electoral success. © 2015, The Author(s) 2015.","electoral expectations; media slant; opinion climate perception; poll effects; polls; social projection; wishful thinking",,,,,,,,,,"Armstrong, D.A., Duch, R.M., Why Can Voters Anticipate Post-election Coalition Formation Likelihoods?

However, it is unknown if journalists actively manufacture and inflate conflict in their coverage of politics, or if they merely respond to contentious politics as it happens. This study focuses on the extent to which journalists take an interventionist stance in the conflict frame building process. We conducted expert interviews (N = 16) among Dutch political journalists. Results show that journalists indeed take an active stance in conflict frame building. They contribute to the emergence of conflict frames by using exaggerating language, by orchestrating, and by amplifying possible consequences of political conflict. However, intervention in conflict framing is not merely a result of individual agency of journalists. Rather, some role conceptions seem to counter an interventionist stance. Media routines that are embedded in organizational practices were found to facilitate this active role in conflict framing. Finally, journalists are mainly found to be active when politicians or parties with political power are involved. © 2015, The Author(s) 2015.","conflict; frame building; framing; interventionism; journalism; news",,,,,,,,,,"Avery, J.M., Videomalaise or Virtuous Circle?

This study attempts to build on existing framing research in two important ways. First, we seek to illuminate the importance of “cultural resonance” in determining whether an individual frame is likely to gain acceptance among its intended audience. Second, we assess the impact of “frame contestation” on the adoption of such frames. We explore these dynamics in the context of the U.S. war in Afghanistan. Specifically, we conducted an experiment in which U.S. adults were exposed to a news story about U.S. military transgressions in Afghanistan. Our results indicate that frames, designed to appeal to and protect the national identity, broadly resonated among respondents, impacting their perceptions of the character, causes and consequences of the transgressions, as well as their broader attitudes about the nation, the U.S. military, and the war in Afghanistan. Nonetheless, when these frames were presented, and then explicitly contested within the same news story, it diminished—but not entirely—these framing effects. We reflect on the theoretical and practical implications of these findings for journalists, officials, and the broader public. © 2015, The Author(s) 2015.","cascading activation; cultural resonance; frame contestation; national identity; War in Afghanistan",,,,,,,,,,"Aikens, M., The A-Team Killings (2013) Rolling Stone, , www.rollingstone.com/feature/a-team-killings-afghanistan-special-forces, Novembe; Anderson, B., (2006) Imagined Communities: Reflections on the Origins and Spread of Nationalism, , New Edition.

Yet studies conducted at the micro-level can provide insight into the influence journalists exert on this fundamental aspect of politics. This case study analyzes the role of media attention in the legislative process that resulted in the legal regulation of (semi)public officials’ remuneration in the Netherlands. The chronological in-depth analysis of claims made in the media and in parliament shows that during the legislative process, political actors responded to media attention directly and indirectly. Incident-driven coverage served as a source for questions and was strategically used by members of parliament (MPs) in legislative debates to substantiate and illustrate their position. More indirectly, long-term trends in media coverage for specific topics contributed to the introduction of and support for amendments to the bill. © The Author(s) 2015.","agenda setting; lawmaking; legislative processes; media; politics",,,,,,"Aard- en Levenswetenschappen, Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek, ALW-NOW: 452-10-016","The author disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was supported by the Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek NWO (Grant 452-10-016).",,,"Andeweg Rudy, B., Irwin.

The article combines a content analysis of 3,792 comments across eighty-five articles that focused on the UN Climate Change Summit, with ten interviews with journalists, two with affiliated commentators, plus the community manager. The results suggest a more positive picture than has been found by many existing studies: Debates were often deliberative in nature, and journalists reported that it was positively impacting their practice in several ways, including providing new story leads and enhanced critical reflection. However, citizen–journalist debate was limited. The results are attributed to the normalization of comment fields into everyday journalism practice, extensive support and encouragement from senior management, and a realization that comment fields can actually make the journalists’ life a little easier. © The Author(s) 2015","climate change coverage; comment fields; Guardian; journalism practice; public sphere; readers’ comments; UGC",,,,,,,,,,"Anderson Ashley, A., Dominique, B., Scheufele Dietram, A., Xenos Michael, A., Peter, L., The ‘Nasty Effect’: Online Incivility and Risk Perceptions of Emerging Technologies (2014) Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication, 19 (3), pp. 373-397; Annika, B., Ingela, W., Beneficial yet Crappy: Journalists and Audiences on Obstacles and Opportunities in Reader Comments (2015) European Journal of Communication, 30 (2), pp. 137-151; Boczkowski Pablo, J., Eugenia, M., How Users Take Advantage of Different Forms of Interactivity on Online News Sites: Clicking, E-mailing, and Commenting (2012) Human Communication Research, 38 (1), pp. 1-22; Axel, B., (2005) Gatewatching: Collaborative Online News Production, , New York: ; :, Peter Lang; Lily, C., The Misconception of Online Comment Threads: Content and Control on Local Newspaper Websites (2013) Journalism Practice, 7 (5), pp. 604-619; Andrew, C., (2013) The Hybrid Media System: Politics and Power, , New York: ; :, Oxford University Press; Luke, C., Brigitte, N., Examining User Comments for Deliberative Democracy: A Corpus-Driven Analysis of the Climate Change Debate Online (2014) Environmental Communication: A Journal of Nature and Culture; Nick, D., (2009) Flat Earth News: An Award-Winning Reporter Exposes Falsehood, Distortion and Propaganda in the Global Media, , London: ; :, Vintage; Mark, D., The Web and Its Journalisms: Considering the Consequences of Different Types of Newsmedia Online (2003) New Media & Society, 5 (2), pp. 203-230; Mark, D., Axel, B., Christoph, N., Preparing for an Age of Participatory News (2007) Journalism Practice, 1 (3), pp. 322-338; David, D., Thorsten, Q., Ari, H., Steve, P., Singer Jane, B., Marina, V., Participatory Journalism Practices in the Media and Beyond: An International Comparative Study of Initiatives in Online Newspapers (2008) Journalism Practice, 2 (3), pp. 326-342; Druckman James, N., Political Preference Formation: Competition, Deliberation, and the (Ir)relevance of Framing Effects (2004) American Political Science Review, 98 (4), pp. 671-686; (2012) The Readers’ Editor on.. the Switch to a ‘Nesting’ System on Comment Threads, , http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/dec/23/switch-nesting-system-comment-threads, ElliottC.

When extremely negative, these portrayals can be used to justify harmful behaviors. Other scholars have found that the norms and structures of professional journalism can moderate extreme portrayals. This paper examines two factors that help construct “the others”—one that polarizes and one that tempers portrayals. By comparing three variables related to portraying foes in five Northern Ireland publications, the research shows two important variations: The first, variation across the partisan divide, suggests the role of identity and ideology in perpetuating “us versus them” and “good versus bad” framing. The second, variation between the professional newspapers and nonprofessional, more partisan publications, suggests that professional journalism may moderate extreme portrayals. These findings may have implications for journalism and for conflict management. © The Author(s) 2015.","blame; construction; dehumanization; demonization; ideology; journalism; journalistic norms; Northern Ireland; political conflict; tone; voice; war; “the others”",,,,,,,,,,"Tim, A., Jean, S., (1999) The Media of Conflict: War Reporting and Representations of Ethnic Violence, , New York: ; :, St. Martin’s Press; Maria, A., (2011) Kill the Messenger: The Media’s Role in the Fate of the World, , Amherst: ; :, Prometheus Books; Maria, A., (2013), University of Southern California; Albert, B., Bill, U., Fromson Michael, E., Disinhibition of Aggression through Diffusion of Responsibility and Dehumanization of Victims (1975) Journal of Research in Personality, 9 (4), pp. 253-269; Daniel, B.-T., Eran, H., de Rivera, J., Collective Emotions in Conflict Situations: Societal Implications (2007) Journal of Social Issues, 63 (2), pp. 441-460; Aaron, B., (1999) Prisoner of Hate: The Cognitive Basis of Anger, Hostility and Violence, , New York: ; :, HarperCollins; Aaron, B., James, P., (2005) The Psychology of Hate, , Sternberg Robert J., ed.

Inspired by these findings and the suggested explanations for them, this article studies in detail politicians’ views on the media’s political agenda-setting power: How do politicians assess media’s power over different types of agendas, do they distinguish between different forms of media power, and does their individual political power position or trust in the media affect how they perceive the media’s power? A survey of Finnish members of parliament (MPs) shows that politicians perceive the media’s power to be massive regarding symbolic but minimal or moderate regarding substantial political agendas. However, many politicians do not clearly distinguish between the media’s political agenda-setting power and its political framing power. Neither experiences of being a minister nor the tendency to use the media as a scapegoat affect politicians’ views on media power in politics. The findings improve empirical knowledge on the media’s power in politics, strengthen the foundations for interpreting existing survey results, and provide a basis for further improving future surveys on media power. © The Author(s) 2015.","media power; mediatization; MPs; political agenda setting; survey",,,,,,"Academy of Finland: 132031

Beginning from this perspective, we analyze trust in government in twenty-seven European countries, testing the interactive relationship between citizens’ policy views and media slant. Under the assumption that news media bias content in the direction of their audiences or are compliant with potential influence exerted by the government, we use Eurobarometer survey data to measure the effects of the ideological slant of newspapers and public television on trust in government. Our results show that the pro- or antigovernment slant of media outlets interacts with the individual ideological views of each citizen and confirm that media act like “echo-chambers” that reinforce preexisting attitudes. Conversely, the consumption of counter-attitudinal information barely alters trust in government nor does it produce hostile media effects. We also find a slight difference between newspaper readers and public service broadcaster (PSB) users, which seems related to mechanisms of cognitive dissonance. © The Author(s) 2015.","government; media audiences; media bias; media effects; partisan journalism; television",,,,,,,,,,"Kees, A., Audun, F., Jesper, S., (2012) How Media Inform Democracy: A Comparative Approach, pp. 98-118. , ,,.

This work attempts to fill in the gaps by shedding light on four main strategies that have been commonly implemented by the Israeli intelligence community: ambiguity and concealment of media relations, the “if you would only know” strategy, exploiting patriotism and cooptation, and information manipulations and psychological warfare. These strategies were utilized frequently by Israel’s intelligence services, and thus have had an impact on the intelligence services’ accountability. However, significant changes in Israel’s society and media have created new challenges to the intelligence services in the public sphere. This study examines these changes and differentiates between the organizations within the intelligence community, domestic and foreign, which, facing differing challenges, tailor different methods for addressing the media as a result. This paper is based on several years of research and a large database of literature, media coverage, and in-depth interviews with key figures in Israel’s intelligence community (former Mossad and Israeli Security Authority directors), senior journalists, and politicians. © The Author(s) 2014","agenda-setting; censorship; media ethics; media scandals; state-media relations",,,,,,,,,,"Bar-Zohar, M., (1972) Spies in the Promised Land: Isser Harel and the Israeli Secret Service, , Boston: ; :, Houghton Mifflin; Bar-Zohar, M., (2003) Ben-Gurion: A Biography, , Tel Aviv: ; :, Magal Books; Bar-Zohar, M., Mishal, N., (2012) Mossad: The Greatest Missions of the Israeli Secret Service, , New York: ; :, Ecco; Becker, H., (1970) The Relevance of Sociology, pp. 99-111. , Douglas Jack D., ed.

The focus is on the perceptions of Bulgarian journalists on the role alleged secret service collaborators played, and continue to play, in the postcommunist society and media landscape. Role perceptions are explored through semi-structured interviews with practicing journalists from the capital city, Sofia. The findings suggest that Bulgarian journalists continue to be concerned with, and affected by, the influence of former communist spies on the Bulgarian media, a controversy that has largely been ignored by media scholars. © The Author(s) 2014","informers; journalists; lustration; media; postcommunism; spies",,,,,,,,,,"Antonova, V., (2009) With a Microphone and an Epaulet: Notes on the Bulgarian Media Dossiers, , http://www.capital.bg/biznes/media_i_reklama/2009/08/07/767346_s_mikrofon_i_pagon/, (accessed February 10, 2014); Cepl, V., The Transformation of Hearts and Minds in Eastern Europe (1997) Cato Journal, 17 (20), pp. 229-234; Cheterian, V., (2009) Media, Democracy and Freedom: The Post-communist Experience, pp. 205-230. , Dyczok MarthaGaman-Golutvina Oxana, ed.

It presents qualitative research examining how government propaganda strategies responded to global asymmetric threats in a post-9/11 media environment. The article draws on both documentary evidence and the accounts of elite sources from Britain and the United States including Public Relations professionals, journalists, and foreign policy, defense, and intelligence personnel. Recently, the intelligence contractor Edward Snowden revealed the extent to which the speed of adaptation in surveillance practices has left policy and oversight behind, raising concern over ethics, privacy, and transparency. The article will explore an adaptation of propaganda systems that also occurred unhindered by public debate. It will show how U.S. and U.K. Governments believed existing propaganda systems were not responding to the information environment and discusses legal, structural, and cultural issues in propaganda practices, post-9/11. Planners assisted in gradually changing structures and cultures of propaganda in both countries for reasons of operational effectiveness. The Anglo-American relationship will be highlighted as one tool capable of overcoming obstacles or restrictions in propaganda for purposes of counterterrorism. Interviews indicated that this was enabled by the countries’ different capabilities and weak legislative restrictions, which some highlighted as advantageous to planning. The article will consider the resilience of U.S./U.K. restrictions and governance of propaganda, highlighting areas for concern. © The Author(s) 2014","Anglo-American relations; counterterrorism; intelligence; national security; propaganda",,,,,,"Economic and Social Research Council, ESRC","The author disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This research was funded in part by an Economic and Social Research Council PhD Studentship.",,,"E-mail (2013) Senior State Department Official; Interview (2013) UK Official; Armitage, R., (2009) Former Deputy Secretary of State, Department of State, , Washington, D.C: ; :; Armstrong, M., (2013) US Chairman of the US Broadcasting Board of Governors, Former Executive Director of the Advisory Commission on Public Diplomacy (March 2011-December 2011), p. 6; Arundell, R., (2013) UK Assistant Head Defense Media and Communications Operations Plans and former Assistant Director—Targeting and Information Operations, MoD; Bacevich, A., (2006) The New American Militarism: How Americans Are Seduced by War, , Oxford: ; :, Oxford University Press; Bernays, E., (2004) Propaganda, , Brooklyn: ; :, Ig Publishing; Briant, E.L., (2014) Propaganda and Counter-terrorism: Strategies for Global Change, , Manchester: ; :, Manchester University Press; Snowden Docs: British Spies Used Sex and ‘Dirty Tricks.’ (2014) NBC News, , http://www.nbcnews.com/news/investigations/snowden-docs-british-spies-used-sex-dirty-tricks-n23091, February7; August12 (1949) Geneva:, , https://www.icrc.org/ihl/INTRO/305?OpenDocument, Convention (III and IV, Respectively) Relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War; (2003) Information Operations Roadmap, , http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB177/info_ops_roadmap.pdf, Washington, D.C.: Department of Defense, National Security Archive; (1984) Overt Psychological Operations Conducted by the Military Services in Peacetime (U), , http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/corres/pdf/332101p.pdf; Dorril, S., (2002) MI6: Inside the Covert World of Her Majesty’s Secret Intelligence Service, , New York: ; :, Simon & Schuster; Dorril, S., (2010) Academic, Investigative Journalist and Author of Numerous Key Texts on MI6, p. 20; Ellul, J., (1973) Propaganda: The Formation of Men’s Attitudes, , New York: ; :, Vintage Books; (2008) United States Intelligence Activities (Amended), , http://www.fas.org/irp/offdocs/eo/eo-12333-2008.pdf; Fitzpatrick Sean, K., (2009) Former Executive Vice President and Vice Chair of the Board of McCann-Erickson World Group, Creative Director—National Center For Unconventional Thought at Potomac Institute for Policy Studies, , Williamsburg, VA: ; :; French, D., (2012) The British Way in Counterinsurgency 1945-1967, , Oxford: ; :, Oxford University Press; Sam, G., (2003) Truth from These Podia: Summary of a Study of Strategic Influence, , http://www2.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB177/Info%20-Operations%20Roadmap%20Truth%20from%20These%20Podia.pdf, Perception Management, Strategic Information Warfare and Strategic Psychological Operations in Gulf II; Guest, G., MacQueen Kathleen, M., Namey Emily, E., (2012) Applied Thematic Analysis, , ,,.

This scrutiny has been fueled in part by what some describe as the development of a “networked fourth estate” (Benkler 2011) involving ad hoc alliances between professional journalists, citizen journalists, hackers, and leakers. On the surface, this attention challenges radical conceptions of a “power elite” remaining in the shadows and impervious to accountability exercised through the media. Amid cultural chaos (McNair 2005) and seemingly ubiquitous displays of adversarial journalism without fear or favor, how far are powerful interests still able to control the agenda and manipulate outcomes? The article presents findings in relation to a single case study involving critical coverage of the national security state and a particular aspect of containment that emerged. It concerns how the controversies were resolved through an apparent spectacle of accountability that suggested a resolution eschewing the need for further scrutiny or sanction. The paper further contends that this element of story “closure” warrants renewed attention in the study of news framing and ideological power. © The Author(s) 2014","agenda-setting; corruption; democracy; ideology; journalism; media framing",,,,,,,,,,"Benkler, Y., A Free Irresponsible Press: Wikileaks and the Battle Over the Soul of the Networked Fourth Estate (2011) Harvard Civil Rights-Civil Liberties Law Review, 46, pp. 311-397; Bennett William, L., (2009) News: The Politics of Illusion, , White Plains, NY: ; :, Longman; Bennett William, L., Gressett Lynne, A., Haltom, W., Repairing the News: A Case Study of the News Paradigm (1985) Journal of Communication, 35 (2), pp. 50-68; Bennett William, L., Iyengar, S., A New Era of Minimal Effects?

The aim of this paper is to consider whether there is any evidence to back up specific allegations made in the Soviet era press in December 1968 that in the post–Second World War period named leading British journalists working for the national newspapers had a covert relationship with the British Secret Intelligence Service that involved their recruitment as agents and the use of intelligence-derived material in their articles in the press. The paper raises questions about the methods of researching such alleged activities. Is it possible in the absence of files from the secret intelligence services to undertake a serious study of such activities? Does the development of digital sources and archives open new fields of detailed study? It also reveals the potential historical significance of the role journalists played in the reporting of key events and policy issues during the cold war. © The Author(s) 2014","cold war; foreign correspondents; intelligence; Izvestiya; journalist agents; MI6",,,,,,,,,,"Aldrich, R.J., Liberation: Rolling back the Frontiers of Cold War History (2001) Cold War History, 1 (2), pp. 122-134; Aldrich, R.J., (2013) Intelligence Studies in Britain and the US: Historiography since 1945, pp. 19-46. , Moran C.

The study presents empirical evidence on how journalists justify truth claims in political news and how journalistic performance has evolved in a post-dictatorial regime setting. The results show that objective reporting is more common than analytical reporting for both the popular and the elite press. However, although the Chilean traditional press assume objectivity as a criterion of good journalism, they reinterpret its meaning in practice. Specifically, the findings show that the use of analytical reporting has significantly increased in political coverage. The absence of formal separation between facts and opinions in the Chilean case confirms the global tendency toward more partisan journalism, especially in journalistic contexts closer to the “polarized pluralist” model. The differences in the use of objective and analytical reporting between the popular and the elite press do not show a clear pattern. © The Author(s) 2014","analytical reporting; cross-longitudinal analysis; objectivity; political news; reporting style",,,,,,"Fondo Nacional de Desarrollo CientÃ­fico y TecnolÃ³gico, FONDECYT: 1110009","The authors disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: Research for this study received funding from Fondecyt (Chile) (Grant 1110009).",,,"Benson, R., News Media as a ‘Journalistic Field’: What Bourdieu Adds to New Institutionalism, and Vice Versa (2006) Political Communication, 23 (2), pp. 187-202; Brants, K., Who’s Afraid of Infotainment?

We also analyze the intensity and range of coverage of EMOs and environmental issues during the 2013 election campaign in relation to behind-the-scenes media practices of EMOs, including the circulation of media releases and other campaign material, and levels of activity on social media and organization Web sites. We find that this activity did not translate into high visibility in news media for EMOs. We offer tentative evidence of a link between the dominance of climate change coverage and the poor visibility of EMOs and other environmental issues. © The Author(s) 2014","Australian election campaigns; Climate change coverage; Environmental movement organizations; Mediated environmental conflict; Mediated visibility",,,,,,"Australian Research Council, ARC: DP103102154","The author disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This research has been conducted as part of an Australian Research Council–funded project “Leadership and the Construction of Environmental Concerns in Australia” 2013–2015 (DP103102154).",,,"AAP, More than 1000 Rally for Barrier Reef (2013) Brisbane Times, , http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/queensland/more-than-1000-rally-for-barrier-reef-20130825-2sjdg.html, August 25.

News coverage of EP elections tends to differ among established and new member states. News in new members contains more coverage of EP elections and the European Union (EU) and tends to also be more positive than in established members. The difference in coverage may play a role in how European institutions are trusted, and ultimately, in election participation. A moderated mediation model is proposed to test whether trust in the EP mediates the relationship between news exposure and voting in EP elections, and whether the relationship between news exposure and trust is stronger among new member states. Using two methods, an experiment conducted in four EU states and a structural equation model of 2004 European Election Studies survey data, support is found for the model. The results also suggest that while European-level considerations account for some of the variance in voting, they cannot be a substitute for national-level considerations. © The Author(s) 2014","Media effects; News reporting; Parliament; Political psychology; Voting behavior",,,,,,,"The author disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This study was supported by a grant from the Marsh Research Fund.",,,"Bèlanger, É., Nadeau, R., Political Trust and the Vote in Multiparty Elections: The Canadian Case (2005) European Journal of Political Research, 44, pp. 121-146; Bennett Stephen, E., Rhine Staci, L., Flickinger Richard, S., Bennett Linda, L.M., Videomalaise Revisited: Public Trust in the Media and Government (1999) The International Journal of Press/Politics, 4, pp. 8-23; Bernstein, R., Chadha, A., Montjoy, R., Overreporting Voting Why It Happens and Why It Matters (2001) Public Opinion Quarterly, 65, pp. 22-44; Blondel, J., Sinnott, R., Svensson, P., Representation and Voter Participation (1997) European Journal of Political Research, 32, pp. 243-272; Blumler Jay, G., (1984) European Elections 1979/81 and 1984, , Reif Karlheinz, ed.

It discusses the concept of a “political public sphere,” and the contribution of both non-traditional news media genres, such as satirical television and infotainment formats, to an expanded conception of the political public sphere. It considers these questions in the context of two case studies: the Q&A program on the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC), and its uses of social media and interactive formats to engage citizens, and the comedy program Gruen Nation, also on the ABC, which analyzed the use of political advertising to persuade citizens during the 2013 Australian Federal election. © The Author(s) 2014","Broadcasting news; Political advertising; Political participation; Public sphere; Television; Television campaign",,,,,,"Australian Research Council, ARC

This article investigates what journalists perceive as the forces affecting uncivil, opinionated commentary in news, what their perceptions are of the effects of this shift on audiences and political culture, and how journalists think uncivil political talk affects journalists’ roles and authority in society. This is accomplished through a qualitative textual analysis of intramedia discussion on journalism organizations’ Web sites, journalism blogs, and news Web sites from the past decade. The analysis revealed that most, but not all, of the journalistic writing examined about civility and incivility expressed concern for incivility, a need for improvement, and a belief that journalists or their organizations are responsible for keeping things civil on their own sites. Analysis of journalists’ articles also revealed interest in academic research about civility, and some of the many ways journalists are dealing with incivility online are based on academic research. The study’s findings provide evidence of journalists’ perceptions of civility in digital news, which inform the arguments put forth by advocates for interventions to improve the quality of public political discourse. © The Author(s) 2014","civil discourse; civility; digital journalism; online news; political talk",,,,,,"Georgetown University","The author disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was supported by a faculty research fellowship from Georgetown University.

This article investigates the European Parliament’s press officers’ professional practices in the light of mediatization and government communication theories. Without one pan-European public sphere, the European Parliament, like the other European Union (EU) institutions, competes with national actors for the news media’s attention in the EU’s twenty-eight national public spheres, where EU affairs do not tend to get a media coverage that matches the EU’s considerable influence on European citizens’ daily lives. This study, which is based on in-depth interviews with European Parliament press officers, concludes that these professionals are indeed attuned to a “media logic” in their communication efforts, and that they face a daily professional challenge as they attempt to promote the European Parliament and its activities to the news media in a way that will not compromise their credibility as government sources. The study provides new insights into communicative aspects of EU governance, and particularly into the thinking that guides the efforts of these European Parliament officials to increase European citizens’ awareness of, and support for, the European Parliament that is meant to voice the citizens’ concerns in political processes at the EU level. © The Author(s) 2014","Agenda-setting; Governance; Government; Parliament; Sources; State–media relations",,,,,,,,,,"Altheide, D.L., Snow, R.P., (1979) Media Logic, , Beverly Hills, CA: ; :, Sage; Anderson, P.J., McLeod, A., The Great Non-communicator?

The rise of Twitter as a key venue for political journalists would seem to support their fact-checking activities. Through a content analysis of political journalists’ Twitter discourse surrounding the 2012 presidential debates, this study examines the degree to which fact-checking techniques were used on Twitter and the ways in which journalists on Twitter adhered to the practices of either “professional” or “scientific” objectivity—the mode that underlies the fact-checking enterprise—or disregarded objectivity altogether. A typology of tweets indicates that fact checking played a notable but secondary role in journalists’ Twitter discourse. Professional objectivity, especially simple stenography, dominated reporting practices on Twitter, and opinion and commentary were also prevalent. We determine that Twitter is indeed conducive to some elements of fact checking. But taken as a whole, our data suggest that journalists and commentators posted opinionated tweets about the candidates’ claims more often than they fact checked those claims. © The Author(s) 2014.","debates; elections; fact checking; journalism; norms and routines; objectivity",,,,,,,,,,"The Value of Fact-Checking in the 2012 Campaign (2012) PolitiFact, November8, , http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2012/nov/08/value-fact-checking-2012-campaign/, AdairB; Adair, B., (2013) Personal Interview with Mark Coddington, Logan Molyneux, and Regina G.

Theoretically, we reject the idea that media logic and political logic are involved in a zero-sum game (where less of one necessarily means more of the other) and instead develop a framework that investigates how commercial, political, and professional logics interact in competitive and complementary ways dependent upon prevailing circumstances and configurations. In the classic argument of mediatization, growing commercial logic sees a consequent falling away of political (or electoral) logic. Our argument is that it is not an either/or but rather a both/and scenario where mediatization and politization of television can go hand in hand. These logics interact in a complex fashion; at times they are complementary, at other times they are competitive. In the rapid development of Indian media, media have become commercialized, regionalized, and vernacularized. Political elites still attempt to maintain control in direct and indirect partisan and indeed in networked media systems. New pragmatic entrepreneurs have emerged with decidedly dubious records and with twin goals of maximizing their economic and political power. At the same time, there is a trend toward journalism that works in the public interest rather than those of narrow regional and/or national elites. © The Author(s) 2014.","Asia; India; journalism; liberalization; market; political parties",,,,,,,,,,"Altheide David, L., Snow Robert, P., (1979) Media Logic, , Beverly Hills: ; :, Sage; http://www.apuwj.org/Magzine/report%20on%20paid%20news2.pdf, Andhra Pradesh Union of Working Journalists. 2010. “Memorandum Submitted to the Press Council of India on Paid News.”; Chadwick, A., The Political Information Cycle in a Hybrid New System: The British Prime Minister and the ‘Bullygate’ Affair (2011) The International Journal of Press/Politics, 16 (1), pp. 3-29; Chadwick, A., (2013) The Hybrid Media System: Politics and Power, , Oxford, UK: ; :, Oxford University Press; Chakravartty, P., Roy, S., Media Pluralism Redux: Towards New Frameworks of Comparative Media Studies ‘Beyond the West.’ (2013) Political Communication, 30 (3), pp. 349-370; Deuze, M., Media Life (2011) Media, Culture & Society, 33 (1), pp. 137-148; Downey, J., (2012) Central and Eastern European Media in Comparative Perspective, pp. 113-136. , Downey JohnMihelj Sabina, ed.

We argue that judgments about the press during a crisis depend on the activation of standing attitudes toward press freedom and media responsibility, which come into play with close attention to ongoing developments. Our model is tested with original survey data collected around two salient press scandals in Britain, one involving the now-defunct News of the World tabloid, the other the storied British Broadcasting Corporation. Support for the model is found. In the aftermath of a press crisis, attitudes toward press freedom and media responsibility are situationally activated by the unique attributes of each scandal, and these attitudes shape evaluations of credibility and support for regulation. Implications for improved understanding of the news evaluation process are discussed. © The Author(s) 2014.","BBC Jimmy Savile scandal; media attitudes; media credibility; media priming; News of the World; phone hacking scandal; press crisis; support for regulation",,,,,,"Texas Tech University, TTU

Based on in-depth interviews with reporters and editors who were involved in the coverage of the protest movement, this article analyzes journalists’ interpretations and negotiations of the various influences on their work during the two major waves of the protest. An analysis of patterns of collision and concurrence between individual, organizational, and professional domains of influence in journalists’ narratives shows that while the norm of objectivity remains a key site of tension in relation to other factors, considerations of newsworthiness are constructed as complementing and justifying all other types of influence. An examination of diachronic patterns suggests that journalists’ individual conditions and positions play a greater role in journalists’ narratives in the first stage of the protest, giving way to professional values and organizational economic considerations in later stages. Although these findings further complicate the protest paradigm, they also show a dominant pattern of “paradigm repair” at the level of both journalists’ professional ideology and protest coverage. © The Author(s) 2014.","journalism; news production; social movements",,,,,,"Hebrew University of Jerusalem, HUJI","The author disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This study was supported by the Levi Eshkol Institute for Social, Economic and Political Research at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.",,,"Anderson, C.W., Between Creative and Quantified Audience: Web Metrics and Changing Patterns of Newswork in Local US Newsrooms (2011) Journalism, 12 (5), pp. 550-566; Bakhtin, M., (1965) Rabelais and His World, , Bloomington: ; :, Indiana University Press; Berkowitz, D., Doing Double Duty: Paradigm Repair and the Princess Diana What-a-Story (2000) Journalism, 1 (2), pp. 125-143; Boyle, M.P., McLeod, D.M., Armstrong, C.L., Adherence to the Protest Paradigm: The Influence of Protest Goals and Tactics on News Coverage in U.S. and International Newspapers (2012) The International Journal of Press/Politics, 17 (2), pp. 127-144; Carlson, M., ‘Where Once Stood Titans’: Second-Order Paradigm Repair and the Vanishing U.S. Newspaper (2012) Journalism, 13 (3), pp. 267-283; Castells, M., (2013) Networks of Outrage and Hope: Social Movements in the Internet Age, , Cambridge, UK: ; :, Polity Press; Chan, J.M., Lee, C.C., (1984) The News Media in National and International Conflict, pp. 183-202. , Arno A.Dissanayake W., ed.

Do they alter journalistic distinctions between legitimate utterances and unacceptable viewpoints? This article provides answers to these questions through a unique data set concerning the coverage of immigration in Norway before and after the Oslo terror of 2011. The data serve as a natural experiment where we can analyze how immigration discourse was changed with regard to its magnitude, topical emphasis, and the sources interviewed. The analysis demonstrate that Hallin’s classic three-sphere model illuminates the dynamics of current meta-debates on polarized topics, where multiple online media continually criticize mainstream media and multiple voices question legitimate discourse. The main finding is that mainstream media definitions of appropriateness and deviance were challenged after the terror, as journalists adapted to a new political context. First, the issue of immigration was covered less in the months after the attacks. Second, the most vocal critics of the current immigration policies were put on the defensive, and debates with a critical potential were largely muted. At the same time, however, the attacks to some extent also opened mainstream media debate to online, deviant anti-Islamic actors who were previously largely silenced and ignored. © The Author(s) 2014.","blog; ethnicity; ideology; journalistic norms; nationalism; terrorism",,,,,,"Norges ForskningsrÃ¥d: 202480/S20","The authors disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was supported by the Research Council of Norway (Grant 202480/S20).",,,"Aalberg, T., Iyengar, S., Messing, S., Who Is a ‘Deserving’ Immigrant?

In Spain, newspaper coverage also affects parliament. A more detailed analysis shows that in Spain, the newspaper that is close to the government is ignored by the opposition as a source for parliamentary questions, while this newspaper also ignores the attention the opposition pays to negative economic developments in its parliamentary questions. In the Netherlands, we do not find any differences across newspapers.

Unlike previous studies, we estimate the effects of exposure to these news outlets while controlling for self-selection into the audience. Our results show that the positive effects of exposure to broadsheets and public broadcasting on knowledge remain robust. Finally, we show that only exposure to broadsheets (and not to public broadcasting) narrows the knowledge gap within nations; relatively apathetic individuals who read broadsheet newspapers are able to ""catch up"" with their more attentive counterparts. © The Author(s) 2014.","knowledge gaps; media contents; media effects; political knowledge; Western E",,,,,,"Ministerio de Ciencia e InnovaciÃ³n, MICINN: CSO2008-03819/SOCI

This article focuses on the audience of Internet alternative media. It examines the factors associated with usage and whether and how usage relates to political participation. Analysis of survey data (N = 1,018) in Hong Kong shows that, not surprisingly, Internet alternative media usage was driven by preexisting political attitudes and critical views toward the mainstream media. But social media usage could also drive alternative media usage even among people who did not hold congruent preexisting attitudes. Meanwhile, alternative media usage leads to protest participation and support for unconventional protest tactics. The study thus provides empirical evidence regarding how Internet alternative media can facilitate the formation of an active online counterpublic and the role of social media in potentially enlarging the counterpublic. © The Author(s) 2014.","alternative media; civil society; Internet; media audiences; political participation; social movements",,,,,,,"The authors disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: The survey reported in the article was funded by a research grant offered to the second author by the Mainland Affairs Council, Executive Yuan, Republic of China (Taiwan).",,,"Asen, R., Seeking the 'Counter' in Counterpublics (2000) Communication Theory, 10 (4), pp. 424-446; Asen, R., Brouwer, D.C., (2001) Counterpublics and the State, , Albany: State University of New York Press; Atkinson, J.D., (2010) Alternative Media and the Politics of Resistance, , New York: Peter Lang; Atton, C., (2002) Alternative Media, , London: Sage; Atton, C., (2004) An Alternative Internet, , Edinburgh, UK: Edinburgh University Press; Atton, C., Hamilton, J.F., (2008) Alternative Journalism, , London: Sage; Atton, C., Wickenden, E., Sourcing Routines and Representation in Alternative Journalism: A Case Study Approach (2005) Journalism Studies, 6 (3), pp. 347-359; Bailey, O.G., Cammaerts, B., Carpentier, N., (2008) Understanding Alternative Media, , Maidenhead, UK: Open University Press; Bennett, L.W., Iyengar, S., A New Era of Minimal Effects?

The article reports findings from a content analysis of 9,127 news articles and editorial columns from fifteen newspapers regarding the trajectory of press-party parallelism over the course of the twelve-week national elections campaign period. We focus on two indicators of press-party parallelism: (1) respective ""voice"" given to the two leading parties, calculated as the ratio of news that quoted sources from the incumbent Adalet ve Kalki{dotless}nma Partisi (AKP) to the leading opposition party Cumhuriyet Halk Partisi (CHP) and (2) news articles' tones toward AKP and CHP. The newspapers that were content analyzed were first categorized into three groups based on survey data regarding the voting intentions of their readers: (1) a group of ""conservative"" newspapers whose readers intended to vote primarily for AKP, (2) a group of ""mainstream broadsheets,"" and (3) a group of ""opposition"" newspapers with a readership base intending to vote for CHP. The findings suggest that over the course of the election campaign, internal pluralism in both conservative and opposition papers declined in terms of voice given to respective parties and tone of news coverage. © The Author(s) 2014.","election campaigns; media systems; polarization; press-party parallelism; Turkey",,,,,,"Emory University

The most frequent account for this trend focuses on news norms and/or the priorities of news journalists. Here, we build on recent work arguing for the importance of demand-side, rather than supply-side, explanations of news content. In short, news may be negative and/or strategy-focused because that is the kind of news that people are interested in. We use a lab study to capture participants' news-selection biases, alongside a survey capturing their stated news preferences. Politically interested participants are more likely to select negative stories. Interest is associated with a greater preference for strategic frames as well. And results suggest that behavioral results do not conform to attitudinal ones. That is, regardless of what participants say, they exhibit a preference for negative news content. © The Author(s) 2014.","consumer demand; experimental design; gatekeeping; horse race; negative news; negativity bias; strategy news",,,,,,"McGill University, McGill","The authors disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research and/or authorship of this article: This research was funded in part by the Centre for the Study of Democratic Citizenship ( http://csdc-cecd.ca ) at McGill University.",,,"Aalberg, T., Strömbäck, J., de Vreese, C.H., The Framing of Politics as Strategy and Game: A Review of Concepts, Operationalizations and Key Findings (2012) Journalism, 13 (2), pp. 162-178; Altheide, D.L., The News Media, the Problem Frame, and the Production of Fear (1997) Sociological Quarterly, 38, pp. 647-668; Andrew, B.C., Media-Generated Shortcuts: Do Newspaper Headlines Present Another Roadblock for Low Information Rationality?

Thanks to the Internet, NGOs are crafting new strategies for conducting information politics. Despite the obvious democratization of access to the means of communication, however, the new media may in fact represent a more challenging environment in which to be heard for some groups seeking global attention. We draw on agenda-setting research to develop a theory of global attention bottlenecks and use it to explain the success of 257 transnational human-rights groups at generating attention in both international mainstream news media and social media outlets. We conclude that most NGOs lack the organizational resources to compete effectively for either traditional news coverage or for public attention and that the Internet is unlikely to resolve the problem of global communication. © The Author(s) 2014.","advocacy; Facebook; human rights; news media; NGO; social media; Twitter; YouTube",,,,,,"Borders

It uses as a starting point the lack of empirical research within mediatization studies, arguing that the field of political agenda setting offers important supplements through systematic investigations of the media's role in promoting social problems on the political agenda. However, this does not imply a straightforward merging of the two traditions. Instead, I discuss how agenda-setting perspectives offer a more active and visible role for political actors and political logics in the media-politics relationship, presenting analyses that find media influence on political issue attention to be conditioned by policy responsibility and the competition between opposition and government. Furthermore, the paper takes issue with the zero-sum game interpretation of the media-politics relationship, where mediatization necessarily implies decreasing political influence. Future research, on both mediatization and agenda setting, need to address how the media (re)distributes power between different actors or institutions in politics. As a first step toward this goal, I show that opposition parties (in some respects) are more mediatized than government but that this constitutes an opposition strength in party competition. © The Author(s) 2013.","mediatized politics; party competition; political agenda setting",,,,,,,,,,"Altheide, D.L., Snow, R., (1979) Media Logic, , Beverly Hills: Sage; Baumgartner, F.R., Jones, B.D., (1993) Agendas and Instability in American Politics, , Chicago: University of Chicago Press; Clark, M., Valence and Electoral Outcomes in Western Europe, 1976-1998 (2009) Electoral Studies, 28 (1), pp. 111-122; Cook, T.E., (2005) Governing with the News: The News Media as a Political Institution, , Chicago: University of Chicago Press; Dalton, R.J., Farrell, D.M., McAllister, I., (2011) Political Parties and Democratic Linkage.

Examining similarities and differences in the genres, topics, and authors of news in each country's leading newspapers, it finds little evidence of greater online homogeneity in any country. U.S. news outlets are more differentiated online than in print, while French news outlets have similar levels of print and online differentiation. Online data for Denmark reveal no consistent pattern in the direction of either homogeneity or differentiation. These findings suggest that the differentiating effects of the online environment are strongest in countries (e.g., the United States) where media markets are being restructured to include more direct competition between agenda-setting news outlets at the national level.

The study indicates that Belgian news coverage of international aid issues is more often based on NGO press releases than government press releases. We also found that the agenda-building capacities of NGOs and government institutions are enhanced as journalists present information subsidies as original journalistic work in most cases. Nonetheless, we must tone down prevailing one-sided conclusions, as most press releases are not just copy-pasted. Instead, most are supplemented with additional sources and information. The data, moreover, identify different journalistic roles of NGOs according to their objectives. While some issue press releases to raise short-term public awareness and donations for humanitarian crises (mobilization), others have developed into established expert news source organizations that provide background information and reliable eyewitness accounts to journalists. © The Author(s) 2013.","agenda building; global civil society; news access; NGOs; public sphere",,,,,,,,,,"Aday, S., Livingston, S., Taking the State Out of State-Media Relations Theory (2008) Media, War & Conflict, 1 (1), pp. 99-107; Beck, U., (1992) Risk Society.

This article addresses the question of how the instability of associative issue ownership at the micro level of individual voters, which could be due in part to election news and political discussion, adds up to the relative stability of associative issue ownership at the macro level. The data come from a panel survey and a content analysis of newspapers and television news bulletins in the 2010 Dutch Parliamentary Election Campaign. Cross-nested multilevel logistic regression models were applied to estimate the impact of political news and political discussion on different respondents for different parties and issues. The findings show how contagion, by traditional issue ownership associations, explains the relative stability at the macro level in spite of volatility at the micro level. Campaign news and political discussion increase the likelihood of contagion by traditional issue priorities of political parties, while also evoking change due to their convergence on the issues of the campaign, from which the parties that own these issues take advantage, among others the VVD and the PVV in the 2010 campaign. © The Author(s) 2014.","agenda setting; election campaign; media effects; public opinion; voting behavior",,,,,,"311-99-17","The authors disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.

Attacks on journalists have continued under the new administration. This study focuses on the erosion of the democratic institution of the press in Mexico's northern states, for the majority of journalists murdered in the last decade worked in that region. Utilizing Shoemaker and Reese's hierarchy of influences model, this study examines pressures constraining the press working in a tide of violence. The thirty-nine semistructured, in-depth interviews with Mexican journalists, who report in five of the northern states, indicate the strongest influences came from outside newsrooms, where intimidation and unthinkable crimes were committed against the press along the entire border. Individual-level influences, such as lack of conflict-reporting training, safety concerns, and handling the trauma of covering violence, were among the strongest pressures often leading to self-censorship. Organizational-level influences, including newsroom policies and financial arrangements with government and business, also influenced journalistic practice. The study added an inter-media level for analyses of news organizations and individual journalists working together to increase safety. Additional findings show major disruptions in border reporting where news ""blackouts"" exist amid pockets of lawlessness. © The Author(s) 2013.","conflict reporting; democratic institutions in Mexico; hierarchy of influences; press-state relations; violence and the press",,,,,,"Army Research Institute for the Behavioral and Social Sciences, ARI","The authors disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: The study received funding from the Association for Education in Journalism and Mass Communication Emerging Scholars Program, The University of Arizona’s Center for Latin American Studies, the Social and Behavioral Sciences Research Institute, and the Udall Center for Studies in Public Policy.",,,"Archibold, R.C., (2012) Attacks on Mexico Papers Underline Peril to Journalists, , http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/12/world/americas/attacks-on-mexico-papers-underline-peril-to-journalists.html, The New York Times, July11, (accessed October 17, 2013); Arrendondo, R.P., Sánchez, R.E.E., (1986) Comunicación Social, Poder Y Democracia, , Guadalajara, Mexico: Difusión Científica; Benavides, J.L., Gacetilla: A Keyword for a Revisionist Approach to the Political Economy of Mexico's Print News Media (2000) Media, Culture & Society, 22 (1), pp. 85-104; Berkowitz, D., Limor, Y., Professional Confidence and Situational Ethics: Assessing the Social-Professional Dialectic in Journalistic Ethics Decisions (2003) Journalism & Mass Communication Quarterly, 80 (4), pp. 783-801; Carter, C., Kodrich, K., Challenges and Dangers of Reporting in a Tumultuous Border Region: How Journalists at the El Paso Times Deal with Violence in Neighboring Ciudad Juarez (2013) Journalism & Mass Communication Quarterly, 90 (2), pp. 331-346; Violence in Mexico and the Right to Information: Analysis of Figures (2011), http://cencos.wordpress.com, CENCOS (National Center for Social Communication), Mexico City: Article 19, (accessed October 17, 2013); Chavez, R., Gunmen Kill Online Reporter in Mexico Border Town (2013), http://bigstory.ap.org/article/gunmen-kill-online-reporter-mexico-border-town, The Associated Press, March4, (accessed October 17, 2013); (2010) Silence Or Death: Crime, Violence and Corruption Are Destroying the Country's Journalism, , New York: Committee to Protect Journalists; (2010) Journalists Murdered in Mexico Since 1992, , New York: Committee to Protect Journalists; (2011) Getting Away with Murder: CPJ's 2011 Impunity Index Spotlights Countries Where Journalists Are Slain and Killers Go Free, , New York: Committee to Protect Journalists; Corbin, J., Strauss, A., (2008) Basics of Qualitative Research, , 2008.

Through a discussion of the changing political fortunes of former Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, the power of political celebrity is attributed to particular structural negotiations between the political and media fields, and also to exploitations of the temporality of political cycles, and the ephemerality of the currency of political celebrity. It is also argued that political celebrity is an unstable phenomenon, partly because it encapsulates a tension between different conceptualizations of subjectivity, where the positing of an autonomous, authentic self competes with a more situational and performative understanding of the self and that this latter understanding of political celebrity is exacerbated in the contexts of post-broadcast democracy. © The Author(s) 2013.","celebrity;

While these assumptions may have been valid when Noelle-Neumann developed her theory forty years ago, the new media landscape, characterized by the proliferation of ideological media outlets, makes them seem outdated. Do audiences of conservative-leaning media perceive a conservative opinion climate while audiences of liberal-leaning media perceive a more liberal distribution of opinion? And if so, what are the consequences? We examine these questions using two data sets collected in extremely different contexts (Study 1 in the context of the 2005 Israeli disengagement from Gaza, n = 519; Study 2, in the context of the 2004 U.S. presidential elections using the National Annenberg Election Survey, n = 9,058). In both studies, selective exposure to ideological media outlets was associated with opinion climate perceptions that were biased in the direction of the media outlets' ideologies. In Study 2, we also demonstrated that partisan selective exposure indirectly contributes to political polarization, and that this effect is mediated by opinion climate perceptions. © The Author(s) 2013.","media effects; partisan journalism; public opinion",,,,,,"University of Pennsylvania, Penn

Scholarly work has shown that the mass media's influence over the political agenda is conditional, yet only recently scholars started to consider the active role of parties and their strategic incentives in responding to the media. This article argues that parties only respond to media attention if the issue is framed in the party's terms, as the right framing helps the party attain its policy goals. This argument is supported by pooled time-series analyses of the issue of European integration and the issue of immigration in Sweden and the Netherlands over the period 1995 to 2010. Altogether, the study contributes to our understanding of the strategic incentives and options parties have in responding to the media, as well as to our knowledge of the role of framing in political competition. © The Author(s) 2013.","agenda setting; comparative research; media framing; political parties",,,,,,"NWO432-08-130","The author disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was supported by the Netherlands Organization of Scientific Research, as part of its program Conflict and Security (NWO432-08-130).",,,"Altheide, D.L., Snow, R.P., (1979) Media Logic, , Beverly Hills, CA: Sage; Bartels, L.M., (1996) Politicians and the Press: Who Leads, Who Follows?, , Paper Presented at the Annual Conference of the American Political Science Association; San Francisco;; Beck, N., Katz, J.N., What to Do (and Not to Do) with Time-Series Cross-Section Data (1995) American Political Science Review, 89 (3), pp. 634-647; Boomgaarden, H.G., Vliegenthart, R., Explaining the Rise of Anti-immigrant Parties: The Role of News Media Content (2007) Electoral Studies, 26 (2), pp. 404-417; Brambor, T., Clark, W.R., Golder, M., Understanding Interaction Models: Improving Empirical Analyses (2006) Political Analysis, 14 (1), pp. 63-82; Budge, I., Farlie, D.J., (1983) Explaining and Predicting Elections: Issue Effects and Party Strategies in Twenty-Three Democracies, , London: Allen and Unwin; Callaghan, K., Schnell, F., Assessing the Democratic Debate: How the News Media Frame Elite Policy Discourse (2001) Political Communication, 18 (2), pp. 183-213; Chong, D., Druckman, J.N., A Theory of Framing and Opinion Formation in Competitive Elite Environments (2007) Journal of Communication, 57 (1), pp. 99-118; Dahlström, C., Esaiasson, P., The Immigration Issue and Anti-immigrant Party Success in Sweden 1970-2006: A Deviant Case Analysis (2013) Party Politics, 19 (2), pp. 343-364; Daviter, F., Policy Framing in the European Union (2007) Journal of European Public Policy, 14 (4), pp. 654-666; de Vries Catherine, E., The Impact of EU Referenda on National Electoral Politics: The Dutch Case (2009) West European Politics, 32 (1), pp. 142-171; Downs, A., (1957) An Economic Theory of Democracy, , New York: Harper; Eilders, C., Media as Political Actors?

This strand of thinking argues that the state's direction toward ""reform"" is not as coherent as commonly believed, a relevant model for examining the role of the state-owned print and online press as an arm of Vietnam's post-communist marketization project. It argues that Party leaders, facing a breakdown of consensus across the spectrum of political and business elites, are using the press in an attempt to manage a growing number of voices in the political system, but that reporting on many political and corruption scandals has simply become unmanageable for state leaders. Under this paradigm, policy debates between ""reformers"" and ""conservatives"" in Vietnam fall short of explaining press censorship. This semidemocratic concept of the media's role opens up room for a wider understanding of civil society under transitional regimes in Asia. This paper draws on twenty-nine interviews with Vietnamese journalists, editors, media executives, Vietnamese and foreign journalism trainers, and government officials from 2010 to 2011, as well as an analysis of press coverage and internal newsroom documents. © The Author(s) 2013.","Communist Party; Internet and media censorship; journalism; marketization; Vietnam",,,,,,,,,,"Abuza, Z., (2001) Renovating Politics in Contemporary Vietnam, , London: Lynne Rienner; Brown, D., Vietnam's Press Comes of Age (2012) Asia Times Online, , http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Southeast_Asia/NB18Ae02.html, [Hong Kong], February18, (accessed June 20, 2012); Cheshier, S., (2009), Hanoi; Cohen, J., Arato, A., (1992) Civil Society and Political Theory, , Cambridge: Massachusetts Institute of Technology Press; (2012) Attacks on the Press in 2011: Vietnam, , http://cpj.org/2012/02/attacks-on-the-press-in-2011-vietnam.php, Committee to Protect Journalists, (accessed July 5, 2012); (2013) Attacks on the Press in 2012: Vietnam, , http://www.cpj.org/2013/02/attacks-on-the-press-in-2012-vietnam.php, Committee to Protect Journalists, (accessed September 20, 2013); Dixon, C., (2004) Rethinking Vietnam, pp. 25-31. , McCargo Duncan, ed.;, London: RoutledgeCurzon; Doan, D.Q., A Review of the Media Communication and Key Tasks in the Future (2012) Ta{Dot below}P Chí Cô{Dot below}Ng Sa{Hook above}N (Communist Review), 15, p. 1. , 6/818; (2013) Freedom of the Press 2013.

In addition, they publicly campaign for policies that they could enact without the support of Congress or the public. The dominant view emphasizes the persuasive capacity of the president or his ability to set the agenda of various government institutions; however, this neglects one of the more powerful components of the bully pulpit. I demonstrate that presidents can use the bully pulpit to remove issues from the national news agenda with relative ease. By modeling the daily change in national media content, I show that presidents can divert the attention of the national media away from issues that are less desirable toward more favorable issues with a single televised address. This suggests that the bully pulpit is more powerful than the current literature expects. © The Author(s) 2013.","agenda-setting; broadcasting news; media effects; presidency",,,,,,,,,,"Agresti, A., (2007) An Introduction to Categorical Data Analysis, , Hoboken: Wiley-Blackwell; Aiken, L.S., West, S.G., Reno, R.R., (1991) Multiple Regression: Testing and Interpreting Interactions, , Thousand Oaks: Sage; Barrett, A.W., Gone Public the Impact of Going Public on Presidential Legislative Success (2004) American Politics Research, 32, pp. 338-370; Baum, M.A., Kernell, S., Has Cable Ended the Golden Age of Presidential Television?

This article uses data on newspaper industry revenues, commercial television revenues, Internet use, and funding for public service media from a strategic sample of six countries to test the structural version of the convergence hypothesis, looking at the period from 2000 to 2009. (The countries included are Finland, France, Germany, Italy, the United Kingdom, and the United States.) The analysis demonstrates an ""absence of Americanization"" as the six media systems have not become structurally more similar over the last decade. Instead, developments are summarized as a combination of (1) parallel displacements, (2) persistent particularities, and (3) the emergence of some new peculiarities. Theoretically, economic and technological forces were expected to drive convergence. The article suggests that the reason these forces have not driven convergence in recent years may be that the interplay between them have changed as part of a broader shift from the mass media, mass production, and mass markets characteristic of twentieth-century Western societies and toward the fragmented media landscapes, tailored production, and niche marketing increasingly characteristic of early-twenty-first century affluent democracies. © The Author(s) 2013.","broadcast news; comparative research; journalism; newspaper industry; North America; Western Europe",,,,,,"Open Society Foundations, OSF","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: Work on this article was supported in part by the Open Society Foundations as part of a larger project on the changing business of journalism and its implications for democracy.",,,"Aalberg, T., van Aelst, P., Curran, J., Media Systems and the Political Information Environment: A Cross-National Comparison (2010) The International Journal of Press/Politics, 15 (3), pp. 255-271; Benson, R., Hallin, D.C., How States, Markets and Globalization Shape the News (2007) European Journal of Communication, 22 (1), pp. 27-48; Blumler, J.G., Gurevitch, M., (1995) The Crisis of Public Communication, , London: Routledge; Blumler, J.G., Gurevitch, M., (2001) Mediated Politics, pp. 380-406. , Bennett W.

But despite the impact of Daniel C. Hallin and Paolo Mancini's book Comparing Media Systems, empirical research into the institutional and systemic preconditions of journalism and news production has not kept pace with the rapid changes in the media, nor with the advances made in other areas of comparative media research (such as studies of news media use, journalists' role-conceptions, and of news content). In this piece, we call for further institutionally and system-oriented mixed-methods comparative research to advance our understanding of how current changes are impacting journalism, the news media, and ultimately politics in different settings. We suggest that existing conceptions of media systems as ideal types need to be supplemented with more empirically grounded and systematically comparative understanding of media systems as dynamic, evolving real types to capture how journalism is changing today. © The Author(s) 2013.","comparative research; democracy; journalism; media systems; news",,,,,,"Open Society Foundations, OSF","The authors disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: Rasmus Kleis Nielsen’s work on this article was supported in part by the Open Society Foundations as part of a larger project on the changing business of journalism and its implications for democracy.",,,"Blumler, J.G., Gurevitch, M., (1995) The Crisis of Public Communication, , London: Routledge; Boix, C., Stokes, S.C., (2007) The Oxford Handbook of Comparative Politics, , Oxford: Oxford University Press; Cook, T.E., (1998) Governing with the News, , Chicago: University of Chicago Press; Curran, J., (2002) Media and Power, , London: Routledge; Curran, J., Iyengar, S., Lund, A.B., Salovaara-Moring, I., Media System, Public Knowledge and Democracy (2009) European Journal of Communication, 24 (1), pp. 5-26; Curran, J., Park, M.-J., (2000) De-Westernizing Media Studies, , London: Routledge; de Vreese, C.H., Banducci, S.A., Semetko, H.A., Boomgaarden, H.G., The News Coverage of the 2004 European Parliamentary Election Campaign in 25 Countries (2006) European Union Politics, 7 (4), pp. 477-504; Dobek-Ostrowska, B., Glowacki, M., Jakubowicz, K., Sukosd, M., (2010) Comparative Media Systems: European and Global Perspectives, , Budapest and New York: CEU Press; Esser, F., Comparative Communication Enquiry: Advancing Cross-National Research in Times of Globalization (2013) International Journal of Communication, 7, pp. 113-128; Esser, F., de Vreese, C.H., Strömbäck, J., van Aelst, P., Aalberg, T., Stanyer, J., Lengauer, G., Political Information Opportunities in Europe: A Longitudinal and Comparative Study of Thirteen Television Systems (2012) The International Journal of Press/Politics, 17 (3), pp. 247-274; Esser, F., Hanitzsch, T., (2012) Handbook of Comparative Communication Research, , London: Routledge; Esser, F., Pfetsch, B., (2004) Comparing Political Communication, , Cambridge: Cambridge University Press; Hallin, D.C., Mancini, P., (2004) Comparing Media Systems, , Cambridge: Cambridge University Press; Hallin, D.C., Mancini, P., (2012) Comparing Media Systems beyond the Western World, , Cambridge and New York: Cambridge University Press; Hanitzsch, T., Esser, F., (2012) Handbook of Comparative Communication Research, pp. 501-516. , Esser FrankHanitzsch Thomas, ed.;, London: Routledge; Hanitzsch, T., Hanusch, F., Mellado, C., Anikina, M., Berganza, R., Cangoz, I., Coman, M., Mapping Journalism Cultures across Nations (2011) Journalism Studies, 12 (3), pp. 273-293; Hepp, A., Couldry, N., (2009) Internationalizing Media Studies, , Thussu Daya, ed.;, London: Routledge; Humphreys, P., (1996) Mass Media and Media Policy in Western Europe, , Manchester: Manchester University Press; Humphreys, P., (2012) Trends in Communication Policy Research, , Puppis ManuelJust Natascha, ed.;, Bristol: Intellect; Just, N., Puppis, M., (2012) Trends in Communication Policy Research, , Just NataschaPuppis Manuel, ed.;, Bristol, UK: Intellect; Levy, D.A.L., Nielsen, R.K., (2010) The Changing Business of Journalism and Its Implications for Democracy, , Oxford: Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism, University of Oxford; Livingstone, S., On the Challenges of Cross-National Comparative Media Research (2003) European Journal of Communication, 18 (4), pp. 477-500; Lugo-Ocando, J., (2008) The Media in Latin America, , Maidenhead: Open University Press; Morgan, G., Campbell, J., Crouch, C., Pedersen, O.K., Whitley, R., (2010) The Oxford Handbook of Comparative Institutional Analysis, , Oxford and New York: Oxford University Press; Nielsen, R.K., (2012) Ten Years That Shook the Media World, , Oxford: Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism; Norris, P., Comparative Political Communications: Common Frameworks or Babelian Confusion?

Prior literature on press treatment of women running for national office suggests that Palin was likely to receive coverage that disadvantaged her due to her gender. We scrutinize press coverage of Palin's campaign for evidence that she was treated differently and that these differences affected public opinion. Our sample of over 2,500 individual newspaper articles published during the campaign is paired with the 2008 National Annenberg Election Survey. We demonstrate that Palin's coverage differed in significant ways from that of her male counterpart. Her gender, appearance, and family status were disproportionately mentioned in her coverage, and such mentions tended to dampen public opinion about her. In addition, the tone of Palin's coverage was markedly negative, increasingly so over time, and was significantly related to reader opinion about her. While Palin was a unique candidate for national-level office, these findings should give pause to those concerned with equitable press treatment of women on the campaign trail. © The Author(s) 2013.","gender; media effects; presidential campaigns; public opinion; Sarah Palin",,,,,,"American Political Science Association, APSA","The authors disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This research was supported by a 2009 American Political Science Association Small Research Grant.",,,"Aday, S., Devitt, J., Style Over Substance: Newspaper Coverage of Elizabeth Dole's Presidential Bid (2001) International Journal of Press/Politics, 6 (2), pp. 52-73; Banwart, M.C., Bystrom, D.G., Robertson, T.A., From the Primary to the General Election: A Comparative Analysis of Media Coverage of Candidates in Mixed-Gender 2000 Races for Governor and U.S. Senate (2003) American Behavioral Scientist, 46 (5), pp. 658-676; Baum, M.A., Groeling, T.J., (2010) War Stories: The Causes and Consequences of Public Views of the War, , Princeton: Princeton University Press; Beail, L., Longworth, R.K., (2013) Framing Sarah Palin: Pit Bulls, Puritans and Politics, , New York: Routledge; Benoit, W.L., Henson, J.R., A Functional Analysis of the 2008 Vice Presidential Debate: Biden versus Palin (2009) Argumentation and Advocacy, 46 (1), pp. 39-50; Bowman, A., Physical Attractiveness and Electability (1985) Women & Politics, 4 (4), pp. 55-65; Braden, M., (1996) Women Politicians and the Media, , Lexington: University of Kentucky Press; Bystrom, D.G., Banwart, M.C., Kaid, L.L., Robertson, T.A., (2004) Gender and Candidate Communication: VideoStyle, WebStyle, NewsStyle, , New York: Routledge; Carlin, D.B., Winfrey, K.L., Have You Come a Long Way, Baby?

As new global flows of capital in media industries have been emerging, it is relevant to consider how investors from autocratic political regimes with illiberal views on the media articulate with Western culture's founding prerogatives of media and journalism. To do this, we singled out the Angola-Portugal relationship. Results show that the clientelistic dynamics in Portugal's media system, enhanced by the economic crisis, facilitate the entrance of the Angolan capital, which, in turn, may perpetuate clientelism and drive the reversal of media democracy in the country. © The Author(s) 2013.","clientelism; democracy; globalization; political economy; sub-Saharan Africa; Western Europe",,,,,,"FundaÃ§Ã£o para a CiÃªncia e a Tecnologia, FCT

The mediation of protest by mainstream media is often deemed to be one-sided, biased in favor of the establishment and predominantly antiprotest, focusing on the spectacular crowding out real debate on the issues. A content analysis of the 2010 U.K. student protests as reported by four U.K. newspapers found this to be only partially true. The use of symbolic damage tactics by the protesters did not squeeze out attention for the issues, rather it increased media attention and coverage considerably. Militant voices were more quoted and given more space in articles than moderate voices. In all newspapers there was a degree of understanding for the anger of the students, but the use of symbolic damage tactics did produce much negative exposure. The use of symbolic damage tactics not only relates to a mainstream media opportunity structure, creating spectacle and drama, but also potentially produces division, negative representation, and delegitimization. Finally, the use of insurrectionary symbolic damage is a reminder of the failings of representative democracy in how it deals with political conflicts. © The Author(s) 2013.","content analysis; logic of damage; media framing; mediation; political violence; student protests",,,,,,,,,,"Barry, A., (2001) Political Machines: Governing a Technological Society, , London: Athlone Press; Brousse, P., La propagande par le fait (1877) Bulletin De La Federation Jurassienne; Cammaerts, B., Protest Logics and the Mediation Opportunity Structure (2012) European Journal of Communication, 27 (2), pp. 117-134; Cammaerts, B., Carpentier, N., Blogging the 2003Iraq War: Challenging the Ideological Model of War and Mainstream Journalism?

The analysis is based on online news from six countries (the United States, Germany, the United Kingdom, Switzerland, France, and Italy), comparing online-only news sites and legacy media. The analysis shows that most online media reported in a diverse way, comprising multiple topics and actors. Furthermore, event-driven news journalism explains the occurrence of high diversity in news reporting. Available resources and the intensiveness of online reporting (the extent as well as the editing style) also account for diversity. We draw from these findings to make a contribution to research on diversity in online news and to comparative communication studies. Qualitative comparative analysis is used to reflect on the direction and meaning of changes in journalistic practices in the current media environment. © The Author(s) 2013.","comparative research; media diversity; news production; online journalism; QCA",,,,,,,,,,"Aalberg, T., van Aelst, P., Curran, J., Media Systems and the Political Information Environment: A Cross-National Comparison (2010) The International Journal of Press/Politics, 15, pp. 255-271; Baron, D.P., Persistent Media Bias (2006) Journal of Public Economics, 90 (1-2), pp. 1-36; Bennett, W.L., (2005) News-The Politics of Illusion, , 6th edition.New York: Pearson Longman.;, New York: Pearson Longman; Bennett, W.L., Livingston, S., A Semi-Independent Press: Government Control and Journalistic Autonomy in the Political Construction of News (2003) Political Communication, 20, pp. 359-362; Benson, R., Hallin, D., How States, Markets and Globalization Shape the News: The French and US National Press, 1965-97 (2007) European Journal of Communication, 22 (1), pp. 27-48; Benson, R., Oersten, M., Powers, M., Willig, I., Vera, S., Media Systems Online and Off: Comparing the Form of News in the U.S (2010) Journal of Communication, 62 (1), pp. 21-38. , Denmark, and France; Besley, T., Prat, A., Handcuffs for the Grabbing Hand?

The purpose is descriptive and analytical. Descriptively, the article charts the presence and provision of investigative journalism across the region and inventories and assesses the various funding forms that exist against the background of the recent (2008-2009) financial crisis. Analytically, the article focuses on assessing the relative autonomy (defined as autonomy from external actors) and effects (defined as the removal from office and sentencing of political actors revealed to be engaged in legal and moral transgressions, commonly various forms of corruption). The article finds investigative journalism across the region in general to be weak in terms of autonomy and effects, but stronger in countries that have had more stable and richer media markets (notably Estonia, Poland, and the Czech Republic).

Because the politicization of the personal through newspaper coverage of bodies and intimate lives has different meanings for women and men politicians, we argue that it is important to account for gender differences in levels of personalization. Our analysis of the Globe and Mail newspaper reporting of thirteen party leadership races held between 1975 and 2012 includes eleven competitive women candidates, four of whom won the leadership contest. Conducting a content analysis of 2,463 newspaper articles published over the course of this thirty-seven-year period facilitates comparison of the levels of personalized coverage over time, by leadership contest, and by candidate gender and success. Findings reveal that the amount of personal coverage did not increase over time, as the personalization literature hypothesizes. However, reporting was significantly more likely to ""make it personal"" for women candidates, as suggested by the literature on media coverage of women politicians. We argue that gendered mediation is largely driving the personalization of political reporting in the Canadian national context © The Author(s) 2013.","Canada; gendered mediation; leadership; personalization; political parties",,,,,,"Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada, SSHRC","The authors disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: Funding for this project was provided by a Standard Research Grant from the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada.",,,"Anderson, K.V., Rhymes with Blunt': Pornification and U.S. Political Culture (2011) Rhetoric & Public Affairs, 14 (2), pp. 327-368; Bain, G., (1994) Gotcha!

Recently, however, it appears as though a growing number of citizens ignore the information opportunities given to them. Changes in the media environment have given people cross-nationally more of a choice regarding the media diet they prefer. For the American case, Prior has demonstrated that in an era of cable TV and Internet, people more readily remove themselves from political knowledge and political action than previously. In this article, we study how the public's consumption of news versus entertainment has developed over the last decade in countries with significantly different media systems. Is there a general increase in preference for entertainment across Europe, and has the gap between news- and entertainment-seekers increased such as documented by Prior for the U.S. case? Who are the European citizens who remove themselves from news and current affairs in the environment of increased choice? Based on data from five waves of the European Social Survey covering more than thirty European countries from 2002 to 2010, we demonstrate how national context or the media environment moderates the influence of individual-level factors in news consumption. © The Author(s) 2013.","information gaps; media systems; media use; news exposure; survey research",,,,,,,,,,"Aalberg, T., Curran, J., (2012) How Media Inform Democracy: A Comparative Approach, , New York: Routledge; Aalberg, T., van Aelst, P., Curran, J., Media Systems and the Political Information Environment: A Cross-National Comparison (2010) The International Journal of Press/Politics, 15 (2), pp. 255-271; Althaus, S.L., Cizmar, A.M., Gimpel, J.G., Media Supply, Audience Demand, and the Geography of News Consumption in the United States (2009) Political Communication, 26 (2), pp. 249-277; Bennett, S.E., Radematcher, E.W., (1997) After the Boom: The Politics of Generation, pp. 21-42. , Craig Stephen C.Bennett Stephen E., ed, Lanham: Rowman & Littlefield; Bennett, S.E., Rhine, S.L., Flickinger, R.S., Reading's Impact on Democratic Citizenship in America (2000) Political Behavior, 22 (3), pp. 167-195; Bennett, W.L., Iyengar, S., A New Era of Minimal Effects?

Although this understanding of the term exists in Indonesia and Malaysia, there it is also used in a variety of other ways that are related to the teachings of Islam and the legacy of authoritarianism. Islam contains strict prohibitions against gossip, libel, and other forms of defamation. For those who are uncomfortable with what they see as the excesses of press freedom, ""trial by the press,"" or the idea that the press should not ""judge"" someone until the facts have been proven in a court of law strongly resembles the Islamic injunctions against fitnah (slander) and gossip. The question of when a Muslim journalist can properly divulge something negative about someone else has implications not only for the popular understanding of libel and defamation but also for investigative reporting. Because the accusation of ""trial by the press"" resonates with deeply held Islamic principles, it can be an exceptionally powerful political tool. © The Author(s) 2013.","authoritarianism; investigative journalism; journalism; journalistic norms; media ethics; Southeast Asia",,,,,,,,,,"Abbot, J.P., Electoral Authoritarianism and the Print Media in Malaysia: Measuring Political Bias and Analyzing Its Cause (2011) Asian Affairs: An American Review, 38, pp. 1-38; Anam, F.K., (2009) Fikih Jurnalistik: Etika & Kebebasan Pers Menurut Islam, , Jakarta, Indonesia: Pustaka Al-Kautsar; Aslan, R., (2006) No God but God: The Origins, Evolution, and Future of Islam, , London: Arrow Books; Brown, G., The Rough and Rosy Road: Sites of Contestation in Malaysia's Shackled Media Industry (2005) Pacific Affairs, 78, pp. 39-56; Bruschke, J., Loges, W.E., (2004) Free Press Vs.

In this article, the relation of ""old"" to ""new"" media is explored in a comparison of televised coverage of the Arab Spring in Al Jazeera English, Russia Today, CNN International, and British Broadcasting Corporation World (BBCW) News. Building on notions of mediapolis and connectivity and mediatized crisis, it seeks to map the shared communicative space opened up by global broadcasters, and how established media actors are adapting to new media ecologies.

We argue that routine conventions (edited packages or two-ways) reflect different types of journalistic interventions, with the use of live, unscripted, and interpretive news practices representing a greater degree of mediatization, since they resemble the style and format of 24-hour media rather than fixed time bulletins. Our content analysis (N = 902) found more live news on commercial bulletins, but all broadcasters exhibited a degree of immediacy and interpretation in their editorial practices. This was most apparent in live two-ways-notably on Channel Five-which produced less source-driven political journalism than edited packages, with political editors playing the role of primary definer. The concept of mediatization, we suggest, can help interpret whether fixed time bulletins conform to their own media logic or adopt the values of 24/7 media. © The Author(s) 2013.","journalistic norms; parliament; television news",,,,,,"Cardiff University","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: We would like to thank Cardiff’s Undergraduate Research Opportunities Programme (CUROP) for funding Richard Thomas, a journalism, media, and cultural studies undergraduate student at Cardiff University, over eight weeks to code and help analyze television news coverage.

Box 600, Wellington 6140, New Zealand","In the mid-1990s, a transnational civil society campaign emerged to challenge Big Pharma over HIV/AIDS medicines patent protection. In 2001, the dispute crystallized into a dramatic media event as pharmaceutical companies sued the South African government over medicine patent laws. The South African lawsuit has been described as a ""public relations disaster"" for Big Pharma, and a turning point in HIV/AIDS medicines and intellectual property rights discourse. This article assesses these claims in relation to a corpus-assisted discourse analysis of 1,000 articles from U.S., U.K., and South African press outlets from 1997 to 2003. The study finds that a key discourse change to occur over this period was the elevation of generic HIV/AIDS medicines from an excluded criminal threat to a respected legitimate option. Given subsequent policy developments considerably increasing access to generic HIV/AIDS medicines in majority world countries, this article argues that the news media discourse change was a key transformative moment in addressing the global HIV/AIDS epidemic. The study also notes, however, that an antigeneric discourse persisted throughout the coverage, signifying the ongoing contestation of medicine patent protection that continues to characterize global HIV/AIDS medicines access. © The Author(s) 2013.","Big Pharma; counter-hegemony; discourse change; generic HIV/AIDS medicines; intellectual property rights; news media; South Africa",,,,,,,"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This research was partially funded by a PhD scholarship from the Ryoichi Sasakawa Young Leaders Fellowship.",,,"Alexander, J.C., Jacobs, R.N., (1998) Media, Ritual and Identity, pp. 23-41. , Liebes TamarCurran James, ed, London: Routledge; Angell, M., (2004) The Truth about Drug Companies: How They Deceive Us and What to Do about It, , New York: Random House; Attaran, A., Gillespie-White, L., Do Patents for Antiretroviral Drugs Constrain Access to AIDS Treatment in Africa?

Applying a process approach, it addresses this issue by exploring journalists' enactment of the watchdog role in two key moments of news production: the interactional phase and the news-construction phase. The study is conducted in the context of press conferences with the Swedish Government and involves data from question-and-answer sessions and published news content that was initiated by such press conferences. With a low or moderate extent of journalistic aggressiveness in the interactional phase, the results indicate that this moment is characterized by cooperativeness and can be described in accordance with an exchange model. By contrast, the analysis of the published news content demonstrates a high extent of criticism and is in line with an adversary model. Altogether, the findings contribute new evidence to suggest that the power relations between journalists and political actors vary across the moments of news production, and that journalistic autonomy increases in the later phases of the process. The differences in the extent of watchdog-role performance are discussed in terms of a strategic ritual by which news journalism promotes a favorable image of itself as a public watchdog institution. © The Author(s) 2013.","journalistic norms; media-source relation; political news production; political press conferences; watchdog function",,,,,,"VetenskapsrÃ¥det, VR","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This study was supported by a grant from the Swedish Research Council (Sw: Vetenskapsrådet ).",,,"Banning, S.A., Billingsley, S., Journalist Aggressiveness in Joint Versus Solo Presidential Press Conferences (2007) Mass Communication & Society, 10 (4), pp. 461-478; Bhatia, A., Critical Discourse Analysis of Political Press Conferences (2006) Discourse & Society, 17 (2), pp. 173-203; Blumler, J.G., Gurevitch, M., (1995) The Crisis of Public Communication, , London: Routledge; Clayman, S.E., (2006) News from the Interview Society, pp. 239-264. , Ekström M.Kroon A°saNylund Mats, ed, Göteborg, Sweden: Nordicom; Clayman, S.E., Elliott, M.N., Heritage, J., Beckett, M.K., A Watershed in White House Journalism: Explaining the Post-1968 Rise of Aggressive Presidential News (2010) Political Communication, 27 (3), pp. 229-247; Clayman, S.E., Elliott, M.N., Heritage, J., McDonald, L.L., Historical Trends in Questioning Presidents, 1953-2000 (2006) Presidential Studies Quarterly, 36 (4), pp. 561-583; Clayman, S.E., Heritage, J., Questioning Presidents: Journalistic Deference and Adversarialness in the Press Conferences of U.S. Presidents Eisenhower and Reagan (2002) Journal of Communication, 52 (4), pp. 749-775; Clayman, S.E., Heritage, J., Elliott, M.N., McDonald, L.L., When Does the Watchdog Bark?

Using a multimethodological approach, we conducted a network, content, and discourse analysis of randomly sampled tweets from approximately one million tweets over a month-long time period to study broadcasting and listening practices on Twitter. The findings suggested networked framing and gatekeeping practices that became activated as prominent actors and frames were crowdsourced to prominence. Quantitative findings underscored the significant role of ordinary users who both rose to prominence and elevated others to elite status through networked gatekeeping actions. In depth, discourse analysis of prominent actors and frames highlighted the fluid, iterative processes inherent in networked framing as frames were persistently revised, rearticulated, and redispersed by both crowd and elite. The ambience and affect afforded by the platform further supported conversational practices that enabled combined processes of networked framing and gatekeeping. The findings point to new directions for hybrid and fluid journalisms that rely on subjective pluralism, cocreation, and collaborative curation. © The Author(s) 2013.","affect; networked framing; networked gatekeeping; social networks; Twitter politics",,,,,,,,,,"Adamic, L.A., Glance, N., The Political Blogosphere and the 2004 U.S. Election: Divided they Blog (2005) In Proceedings of the 3rd International Workshop on Link Discovery (LinkKDD), , http://www-personal.umich.edu/~ladamic/projects/, New York.

The verbal- and visual-framing analyses conducted focus on the visibility of these candidates, their viability (horse-race frame), and the balance between issue-related coverage (issue frame) and gendered coverage (trivialization frame). Our sample encompasses 249 news stories from the web sites of the most influential broadsheets and tabloids in Romania, namely, Cancan, Evenimentul Zilei, Gândul, and Libertatea. The results point toward a gender bias on the part of media. Whereas women dominated the tabloid outlets, men were featured prominently in the broadsheets. The trivialization and the issue frames appeared more often for female candidates, whereas the results for the horse-race frame were mixed. While factors other than gender (such as experience) might have influenced the coverage of these particular candidates, it is still too early to proclaim equal treatment in the media, especially since women were considered unable to deal with the issues they were linked to. © The Author(s) 2013.","Eastern Europe; gender; media bias; media framing",,,,,,"European Social Fund, ESF

As for news agencies, the official Efe, founded in 1939, was favored by both dictatorial and democratic governments, which considered it as a strategic instrument to support dictatorship or foster democracy depending on the historical context. Europa Press, a private news agency founded in 1957, became its main competitor and earned high reputation by taking advantage of the news stories that Efe did not dare to cover because of its political ties. The Minister of Information attempted to close down the agency but he finally was dismissed due to internal political struggles. The situation, however, did not change either during the transition to democracy (1975-82) or the first Socialist government (1982-86). In both periods, the ruling parties boosted Efe through different means and sought the economic suffocation of Europa Press. Based on documents from the archive of Antonio Herrero, director of Europa Press between 1964 and 1989, this article analyzes the most significant episodes of government pressures on this agency and the arguments used to justify them. Conclusions on the relationship between news agencies and the State in processes of transition to democracy are also reached. © The Author(s) 2013.","censorship; journalism; media and politics; news agencies; Spain; transitions to democracy",,,,,,,,,,"Alférez, A., (1986) Cuarto Poder En España.

We content analyzed twelve newspapers' coverage of the 2011 general election in Ireland. Ireland's newspaper market has some special advantages for social scientists, as it allows us to separate the newspaper types/formats (tabloid vs. broadsheet) from their commercial basis (vulnerability or otherwise to short-term sales and profits). Therefore, we are able to make a particular contribution to the long-standing debate about the interaction of free market capitalism and the media. Our results do not find a homogeneous general election frame in Ireland. The variation in framing across Irish newspapers was much greater than that between the five countries for which we can find strictly comparable results. The different commercial statuses of the newspapers do seem to be related to different dominant frames of election coverage, but only after we develop a new measure that takes account of the relative overall prominence of election coverage in the newspapers examined. © The Author(s) 2012.","elections; framing; Ireland; media systems; newspapers",,,,,,"Dublin City University, DCU

Focusing on one of the most important media effect theories, agenda setting, this study combines a panel survey and a media content analysis to test three claims derived from the new era of minimal effects discussion: (1) that recent media environmental changes have reduced the agenda setting influence of traditional news media to non-significance, (2) that increased opportunities for media choice have made partisan selective exposure the key mechanism behind media effects, and (3) that the availability of alternative online news sources reduces susceptibility to agenda setting effects from the traditional news media. Among other things, the results show that traditional news media still exert agenda-setting influence on both the aggregate and individual levels, but that these effects are weakened by use of multiple online news media. Overall, the results suggest that a generalized ""we"" have not (yet) entered a new era of minimal effects, and that certain media system characteristics are likely to condition the pace of any potential transition to a new minimal effects era. © The Author(s) 2013.","agenda setting; audience selectivity; media effects; panel survey",,,,,,,,,,"Aalberg, T., Curran, J., (2011) How Media Inform Democracy.

The article presents two broad theoretical principles. The first is that one cannot understand the role of social media in collective action without first taking into account the political environment in which they operate. The second principle states that a significant increase in the use of the new media is much more likely to follow a significant amount of protest activity than to precede it. The study examines these two principles using political, media, and protest data from twenty Arab countries and the Palestinian Authority. The findings provide strong support for the validity of the claims. © The Author(s) 2013.","Arab Spring; new media; PMP principle; protest",,,,,,,,,,"Alimi, E.Y., (2007) Israeli Politics and the First Palestinian Intifada: Political Opportunities, Framing Processes and Contentious Politics, , New York: Taylor & Francis; Almond, G.A., Powell, G.B., Karre Strom, K., Dalton, R.J., (2000) Comparative Politics Today: A World Review, , New York: Longman; Anderson, L., Demystifying the Arab Spring (2011) Foreign Affairs, 90 (3), pp. 2-7; Bellin, E., Reconsidering the Robustness of Authoritarianism in the Middle East: Lessons from the Arab Spring (2012) Comparative Politics, 44 (2), pp. 127-149; Bennett, L., (2006) Cyberprotest: New Media, Citizens and Social Movements, , van de Donk W.Loader B.

Unlike political movements of the recent past, the Tea Party stands starkly to the right. This study examines nightly cable news coverage of this movement by using key frames associated with the ""protest paradigm""-the tendency for media to marginalize movements by drawing attention away from core concerns raised by such movements. We ask whether the protest paradigm can be applied to a right-wing movement and whether such application varies by the ideological leaning of a given source. That is, do cable news channels use frames in ways consistent with their respective ideological hues? We draw on a representative sample of stories regarding the national movement from the most viewed nightly news programs on Fox News, MSNBC, and CNN, with the Associated Press as a reference point. Results show significant differences across sources in issue and marginalization frame use. Although utilization of marginalization frames is popular among ideological channels, traditional news sources are not immune from using these devices. © The Author(s) 2013.","cable television; media framing; partisan journalism; social movements",,,,,,,,,,"A Clear Rejection of the Status Quo, No Consensus about Future Policies (2010) Pew Research Center for the People & the Press, , http://pewresearch.org/pubs/1789/2010-midterm-elections-exit-poll-analysis, November 17.

Results suggest a strong association between media freedom and corruption that runs from high levels of media freedom to low levels of corruption. This study also implies that media freedom might have a stronger indirect effect on corruption when coupled with powerful institutions of horizontal accountability. The data suggest that the association between media freedom and corruption is strongest in countries with parliamentary systems than in those with presidential systems, and that this impact amplifies as the judiciary independence increases. © The Author(s) 2013.","corruption; media and democracy; media effects; media freedom; political accountability",,,,,,,,,,"Ahrend, R., (2002) DELTA, , Delta, Paris:; Beck, T., Clarke, G., Groff, A., Keefer, P., Walsh, P., New Tools in Comparative Political Economy: The Database of Political Institutions (2001) World Bank Economic Review, 15 (1), pp. 165-176; Becker, L.B., Vlad, T., Nusser, N., Media Freedom: Conceptualizing and Operationalizing the Outcome of Media Democratization (2004) Presented at the annual meeting of the International Association for Media and Communication Research, , Porto Alegre, Brazil; Berkowitz, D., (1992) Public Opinion, the Press, and Public Policy, pp. 81-102. , Kennamer David J., ed., Westport, CT: Praeger; Besley, T., Burgess, R., Political Agency, Government Responsiveness and the Role of the Media (2001) European Economic Review, 45, pp. 629-640; Besley, T., Burgess, R., The Political Economy of Government Responsiveness: Theory and Evidence from India (2002) Quarterly Journal of Economics, 117 (4), pp. 1415-1451; Besley, T., Prat, A., Handcuffs for the Grabbing Hand?

Using Brazil's military regime (1964-85), it investigates whether changing press censorship influenced public support for military rule during the period of political liberalization. This paper uses the exposure-resistance model of opinion formation, in which a person's probability of supporting a position depends first on her probability of exposure to and reception of an elite cue advocating that position, and secondarily on the probability that she resists that position once exposed. Her likelihood of exposure to and reception of elite cues increases with her attention to news media and the extent of her political awareness; her odds of accepting the positions advocated by elites depends on her political ideology and her critical capacity to evaluate the content and source of the cue. Using three public opinion surveys carried out between 1972 and 1982, and an analysis of newspaper content during the dictatorship, this research demonstrates that censored media convinced Brazilians to support military rule initially, only later during political liberalization, to expose them to increasingly critical coverage of the regime, convincing many to abandon their support for the regime. © The Author(s) 2013.","authoritarian; Brazil; Latin America; media; public opinion",,,,,,,,,,"Alves de Abreu, A., (2002) A Modernizacão Da Imprensa: Descobrindo O Brasil, , Austin, TX: University of Texas Press; Amaral, R., Guimarães, C., Media Monopoly in Brazil (1994) Journal of Communication, 44 (4), pp. 26-38; Barker David, C., Values, Frames, and Persuasion in Presidential Nomination Campaigns (2005) Political Behavior, 27 (4), pp. 375-394; Baum Matthew, A., Groeling, T., (2010) War Stories: The Causes and Consequences of Public Views of War, , Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press; Chaparro, M.C., (2008) Sotaques D'aquém E D'além Mar, , São Paulo, Brazil: Summus Editorial; Chong, D., Druckman, J.N., A Theory of Framing and Opinion Formation in Competitive Elite Environments (2007) Journal of Communication, 57 (1), pp. 99-118; Collings, A., (2001) Words of Fire: Independent Journalists Who Challenge Dictators, Drug Lords, and Other Enemies of a Free Press, , New York: New York University Press; Converse, P.E., McDonough, P.J., de Souza, A.G., Youssef, C., Representation and Development in Brazil, 1972-1973 (1980) Conducted by University of Michigan, Center for Political Studies, , www.icpsr.umich.edu, [Computer file]. 2nd ICPSR ed.

However, this focus never materialized and it was just more business as usual but with the added novelty of televised leaders' debates, which meant that coverage was more male ordered than ever. The study on which this article is based monitored articles published in the four weeks leading up to election day across twelve newspapers, comprising a mix of dailies and weekend editions, broadsheets and midmarket, and tabloid titles. The study concentrated on articles that had the election as the main story and which mentioned or sourced one or more candidates, both MPs seeking reelection, and Parliamentary Candidates. We were interested in exploring (any) differences in the news coverage of women and men candidates, looking at both frequency and content. Our findings suggest that women were much less likely to feature in news stories than men, even when controlling for Party Leader coverage. Women were much more likely to be mentioned or quoted in feature articles focused explicitly on gender issues, made interesting because of their sex and couture rather than their political abilities and experience. © The Author(s) 2013.","election campaign; gender; newspapers",,,,,,,,,,"Adcock, C., The Politician, the Wife, the Citizen and Her Newspaper: Rethinking Women, Democracy and Media(ted) Representation (2010) Feminist Media Studies, 10 (2), pp. 135-160; Ashe, J., Campbell, R., Childs, S., Evans, E., Stand by your Man': Women's Political Recruitment at the 2010 General Election (2010) British Politics, 5 (4), pp. 455-480; Ayers, E., Lawson, M., (2011) A-Gendered Press, , London: ECHO; Banwart, M.C., Bystrom, D.G., Terry, R., From the Primary to the General Election: A Comparative Analysis of Candidate Media Coverage in Mixed-Gender 2000 Races for Governor and US Senate (2003) American Behavioral Scientist, 46 (5), pp. 658-676; Braden, M., (1996) Women, Politicians and the Media, , Lexington: University of Kentucky Press; Bystrom, D.G., Robertson, T., Banwart, M.C., Framing the Fight: An Analysis of Media Coverage of Female and Male Candidates in Primary Races for Governor and U.S. Senate in 2000 (2001) American Behavioral Scientist, 44, pp. 1999-2013; Campbell, R., Lovenduski, J., Winning Women's Votes?

Media fragmentation and audience segmentation are not new but they greatly increased in the very last years because of the long ongoing tendency towards commercialization and mostly because of the development of new media and the internet in particular. This has determined what is usually defined ""the crisis of traditional journalism"" that has become the very frequent topic of most of the seminar on journalism today. The last part of the paper looks at the possible consequences of these changes over the structure of democracy beyond the well rooted techno-optimism: increasing social and political polarization, new forms of political socialization, more complex process of social and political negotiation, new forms of public scrutiny. © The Author(s) 2013.","fragmentation; journalism; new technologies",,,,,,,,,,"Baum, M.A., Groeling, T.J., New Media and the Polarization of American Public Discourse (2008) Political Communication, 25, pp. 345-365; Bennett, W.L., The UnCivic Culture: Communication, Identity, and the Rise of Lifestyle Politics (1998) PS: Political Science and Politics, 31, pp. 740-761; Bennett, W.L., Communicating Global Activism.

Briefly outlining the history of internationalization of CEE media markets, it argues that the presence of Western-based multinational companies on the CEE media markets has been recently diminishing rather than further growing. In addition, a different type of actor has been gaining prominence on the CEE media map, unspotted or largely overlooked in most previous analyses, namely, local business elites acquiring stakes in news media. Combining secondary sources and field interviews with media experts and practitioners, this study explores the various practices of business and political instrumentalization of media by their local owners, often resulting in a constrained editorial independence and increasing intertwinement of the systems of media, politics, and economy in the region. © The Author(s) 2012.","business tycoons; de-Westernization; instrumentalization; media autonomy; media ownership; media systems",,,,,,"European Research Council, ERC","The research for this article was conducted as part of the project Media and Democracy in Central and Eastern Europe, funded by the European Research Council (project Nr. 230113).",,,"Alexander, J.C., (1981) Mass Media and Social Change, , Katz ElihuSzecskö Tamás, ed., London: Sage; Balcytiene, A., Market-Led Reforms as Incentives for Media Change, Development and Diversification in the Baltic States: A Small Country Approach (2009) International Communication Gazette, 71 (1-2), pp. 39-49; Balcytiene, A., Lauk, E., Media Transformations: The Post-transition Lessons in Lithuania and Estonia (2005) Informacijos Mokslai, 33, pp. 96-109; Coman, M., Journalistic Elites in Post-communist Romania (2010) Journalism Studies, 11 (4), pp. 587-595; Curran, J., Park, M.-J., (2000) De-Westernizing Media Studies, , Curran JamesPark Myung-Jin, ed., London: Routledge; Dobek-Ostrowska B.Głowacki, M., (2008) Comparing Media Systems in Central Europe.

It is suggested that a broader understanding of clientelism, looking in particular at how media are used as elite-to-elite communication tools as well as elite-to-mass communication tools, better explains the place of the media in the clientelistic systems of the CEE nations. Empirically, it is based on a set of 272 elite and expert interviews conducted across ten CEE countries (Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, and Slovenia) in 2010 and 2011. The article presents some general findings on the nature and character of the linkages between political elites and the media, and the extent to which such linkages can be considered clientelistic. Then follows a discussion of specific practices of media instrumentalization, charting the many ways in which the media can function as a resource in conflicts and negotiations between clientelistic elite networks, directly as well as indirectly. Particular attention is given to the phenomena of advertorials and kompromat. © The Author(s) 2012.","Central Europe; clientelism; Eastern Europe; journalism",,,,,,"European Research Council, ERC: 230113","The salary and research expenses of the author was paid for via a 4-year research grant made by the European Research Council for the project Media and Democracy in Central and Eastern Europe (MDCEE; grant no. 230113).",,,"Aberbach, J.D., Rockman, B.A., Conducting and Coding Elite Interviews (2002) PS: Political Science and Politics, 35 (4), pp. 673-676; Bærug, R., (2005) The Baltic Media World, pp. 58-89. , Bærug Richard, ed., Riga: Royal Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Kingdom of Norway; Bailey, F.G., (1969) Stratagems and Spoils: A Social Anthropology of Politics, , Oxford: Blackwell; Bajomi-Lazar, P., (2011) Romania.

However, nearly all such studies have been conducted in the context of the United States or other advanced democracies, and in these countries media use competes with a variety of other-perhaps much stronger-factors influencing political engagement, such as well-developed partisanship, strong group loyalties, lifelong personal experiences with the political system, and so forth. We chose to investigate the ""malaise versus mobilization"" question in the context of three new democracies-the Czech Republic, Hungary, and Poland-where the above-mentioned factors have not yet had a chance to mature, and where media use could potentially have an especially strong impact on attitudes and behavior. The project utilizes a series of comparable questions on national random-sample surveys carried out in each country during the parliamentary election campaigns of 2005 and 2006 to map party supporters and media audiences, and assess questions about malaise versus mobilization. Our maps of party supporters and media audiences show that TV news and tabloids reach larger and more diverse audiences than broadsheets and some niche broadcasting channels. In all three countries, while there were no significant relationships between media use and trust in government, there was some evidence to support the mobilization hypothesis: the use of broadsheets and politically opinionated weekly news magazines had a strong positive relationship with political engagement that remained when controlling for political interest and a number of sociodemographic characteristics. Our research suggests that the malaise versus mobilization debate continues to be an important basis for studying these more recent democracies. © The Author(s) 2012.","Central Europe; media audiences; media effects; state-media relations",,,,,,"1H02E06028","The 2005 Polish National Election Study (PGSW) was funded by the Polish Ministry of Scientific Research and Information Technology (Grant 1H02E06028).",,,"Avery, J.M., Videomalaise or Virtuous Circle?

The findings suggest that in Bulgaria closed-knitted networks between the two sets of actors continue to shape political communication breeding 'deals' and even corruption that seriously undermine the independence of political journalism. In contrast, political communication roles in Poland appear more differentiated making it more difficult for political actors to exercise control over the public agenda. © The Author(s) 2012.","Bulgaria; Poland; political communication culture; political communication norms; relationship between journalists and politicians; transitional democracies",,,,,,"British Academy: LRG-45511","The study is part of the project “Political Communication in New Democracies: Government –Media Relations in Transition,” which included eight countries from Eastern Europe, East Asia, Southern Africa, and Latin America.

This process necessarily benefits some candidates over others. We analyze how the press winnowed the candidate fields of both parties in the early 2008 preprimary campaign. We find coverage remarkably similar across a wide range of traditional and new media, including newspaper, radio, television, cable, legacy and web-native Internet news, and talk shows. The media ignored most candidates to concentrate on the Democratic contest between Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama while paying less attention to the Republican race. Tone towards candidates was uniform except on partisan talk shows. The tone of Internet news was slightly more balanced than traditional outlets. Similar coverage across media results from journalistic preference for dramatic story lines, staffing constraints, and widespread speculation about candidate viability, which we describe as ""handicapping the candidates."" © The Author(s) 2012.","Internet news; media handicapping; media primary; new media; preprimary; presidential primaries; winnowing",,,,,,,,,,"Althaus, S.L., Edy, J.A., Entman, R.M., Phalen, P., (1996) Political Communication, pp. 407-421. , ed; Bennett, W.L., Towards a Theory of Press-State Relations in the United States (1990) Journal of Communication, 40 (2), pp. 103-127; Bennett, W.L., (2005) Freeing the Presses: The First Amendment in Action, , Cook T.

We analyze (1) how German news broadcasts treated governmental intervention during the crisis and (2) selected effects on public opinion. Drawing on results from a content analysis of television news broadcasts (n = 980), we show that governmental intervention was covered substantially, focusing on fiscal measures. To investigate possible effects of the news coverage, we conducted an online experiment with subjects differing in their degree of involvement with the consequences of the crisis (n = 293).

New Zealand's Ma-ori Television Service (MTS) has been dubbed the country's only real provider of public service television and has appeal far beyond a narrow target audience. An analysis of 2008 national election coverage shows that MTS, while focused on Ma-ori concerns, was closer to public service expectations on a number of measurements than the two mainstream prime-time news programs. The paper examines coverage on state-owned TVNZ, private channel TV, and MTS, aiming to throw light on the contribution that a different-indigenous-perspective can make. © The Author(s) 2012.","indigenous media; minority media; news media; public service broadcasting",,,,,,,,,,"Aalberg, T., van Aelst, P., Curran, J., Media Systems and the Political Information Environment: A Cross-National Comparison (2010) International Journal of Press/Politics, 15 (3), pp. 255-271; Abel, S., (1997) Shaping the News: Waitangi Day on Television, , Auckland, NZ: Auckland University Press; Adds, P., Bennett, M., Hall, M., Kernot, B., Russell, M., Walker, T., (2005) The Portrayal of Māori and Te Ao Māori in Broadcasting: The Foreshore and Seabed Issue, , Wellington, NZ: Broadcasting Standards Authority; Altheide, D.L., Snow, R.P., (1991) Media Worlds in the Postjournalism Era, , New York: Aldine de Gruyter; Archie, C., (2007) Pou Kōrero: A Journalist's Guide to Māori and Current Affairs, , Wellington, NZ: New Zealand Journalists Training Organisation; Atkinson, J., (1994) Leap into the Dark: The Changing Role of the State in New Zealand Since 1984, pp. 146-177. , Sharp Andrew, ed., Auckland, NZ: Auckland University Press; Atkinson, J., (2004) Political Communications in New Zealand, pp. 136-158. , Hayward JanineRudd Chris, ed., Auckland, NZ: Pearson Education; Atkinson, J., Politics of Spin (2006) New Zealand Government and Politics, pp. 464-478. , ed.

The cross-national and cross-temporal design traces the composition and development of political information environments with regard to the amount and placement of news and current affairs programs on the largest public and private television channels. It finds that the televisual information environments of Israel and Norway offer the most advantageous opportunity structure for informed citizenship because of their high levels of airtime and a diverse scheduling strategy. The study contributes to political communication research by establishing ""political information environments"" as a theoretically and empirically grounded concept that informs and supplements the comparison of ""media systems.""

Through both quantitative and qualitative analyses, this study seeks to unravel the interplay between the state and media in China's march toward modernization by examining coverage of rural development in People's Daily (PD). From 1997 to 2006, China's central party organ reported an enormous increase in the central officials' efforts to boost the rural income, but highlighted in a hierarchical way their responsiveness according to the logics of period, region, and the task. In its assessment of rural anomalies, the responsibility was devolved to local bureaucracies, hence shifting the blame away from the central authority. A discourse analysis showed the PD stuck to a contour of economic developmentalism that upheld information and technology as the panacea, and perpetuated the state's redistributive role as the key to social equality. As such, the overtly propagandist rhetoric has been increasingly giving way to a coherent set of framing practices that rationalize the centrality of the party-state in China. © The Author(s) 2012.","Asia; ideology; media framing; newspapers; social issues; state-media relations",,,,,,,,,,"Alexseev, M.A., Bennett, W.L., For Whom the Gates Open: News Reporting and Government Source Patterns in the United States, Great Britain, and Russia (1995) Political Communication, 12 (4), pp. 395-412; Bennett, W.L., Toward a Theory of Press-State Relations in the United-States (1990) Journal of Communication, 40 (2), pp. 103-125; Bian, Y., Chinese Social Stratification and Social Mobility (2002) Annual Review of Sociology, 28, pp. 91-116; Elizabeth, B.S., Dardenne, R.W., (1997) Social Meanings of News: A Text-Reader, , Berkowitz Daniel A., ed., Thousand Oaks, CA: SAGE; Brady, A.-M., (2008) Marketing Dictatorship: Propaganda and Thought Work in Contemporary China, , Lanham, MD: Rowman & Littlefield; Brady, A.-M., Mass Persuasion as a Means of Legitimation and China's Popular Authoritarianism (2009) American Behavioral Scientist, 53 (3), pp. 434-457; Brown, M.E., (2000) The Rise of China, , Cambridge, Massachusettes: MIT Press; Cai, Y., (2006) State and Laid-off Workers in Reform China: The Silence and Collective Action of the Retrenched, , New York: Routledge; Cao, Q., Confucian Vision of a New World Order?

To develop a more precise understanding of such coverage, this study content analyzes an international set of newspapers (N = 220) to explore the relationships between a protest group's goals and tactics on resulting news coverage. The findings indicate that a group's tactics-more than its goals-play a substantial role in affecting coverage.

But while the digital revolution has promoted freedom of expression and freedom of information, it has had mixed effects on the freedom of the press. Throughout the advanced democratic world -more acutely in some countries than in others -the rise of digital communications has undermined the financial condition and economic independence of the press. New media have not, as of yet, offset losses in more traditional media. With its high dependence on advertising revenue, American journalism has been especially vulnerable to stress. In the late twentieth century, observers expected the news media in Europe to evolve in an American direction; instead American journalism has been moving in a more European direction -more partisan and less financially secure -though public policy in the United States shows no signs of adjusting to the new realities. © The Author(s) 2012.","comparative media systems; digital media; freedom of the press; media economics",,,,,,,,,,"Bell, D., (1973) The Coming of Post-Industrial Society, , New York: Basic Books; Fukuyama, F., (1992) The End of History and The Last Man, , New York: Free Press; Benkler, Y., (2006) The Wealth of Networks: How Social Production Transforms Markets and Freedom, , New Haven, CT: Yale University Press; Cook, P.S., (1992) The Future of News, , Washington, DC: Woodrow Wilson Center Press; (2010) Decline In U.S. Newsrooms Slows, , http://asne.org/article_view/articleid/763/decline-in-newsroom-jobs-slows.aspx, American Society of Newspaper Editors, April 11; (2009) The Evolution of News and The Internet&quot, p. 19. , Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, Paris, December; Decline In U.S. Newsrooms Slows, , American Society of Newspaper Editors; Hallin, D.C., Mancini, P., (2004) Comparing Media Systems: Three Models of Media and Politics, , New York: Cambridge University Press; Alexander, J.C., The Mass News Media in Systemic, Historical and Comparative Perspective (1981) Mass Media and Social Change, pp. 17-51. , in Elihu Katz and Tamás Szecsko?, eds, Beverly Hills, CA: SAGE; Prior, M., (2007) How Media Choice Increases Inequality In Political Involvement and Polarizes Elections, , Post-Broadcast Democracy, New York: Cambridge University Press; Wattenberg, M.P., (2008) Is Voting For Young People?, pp. 9-33. , New York: Pearson Longman, esp; Audience Segments in a Changing News Environment (2008) News Consumption and Believability Study (, p. 5. , http://people-press.org/reports/pdf/444.pdf, Pew Research Center for the People and the Press, August 17; Americans Spend More Time Following the News, , http://people-press.org/report/652/, Pew Research Center for the People and the Press, September 12, 2010), available at; Starr, P., Goodbye to the Age of Newspapers (Hello to a New Era of Corruption (2009) The New Republic, pp. 28-35. , March 4; Antheaume, A., The French Press and Its Enduring Institutional Crisis (2010) The Changing Business of Journalism and Its Implications For Democracy, pp. 69-80. , in David A.L.

These managed photos and videos communicate officialdom, voyeurism, and pseudo-events, ranging from routine government business to a personal side of political leaders. They are designed to frame the subject in a positive light and to promote a strategic image. This article submits that demand for digital handouts of visuals, or ""image bytes,"" is stimulated by economics and institutional accommodation, including the constant need for Web content and journalists' eroding access to government officials. A profile of the image management of Prime Minister of Canada Stephen Harper illustrates the jockeying between politicians, PR staff, and journalists over news selection, pseudo-events, framing and gatekeeping. Insights from 32 interviews with Canadian journalists and Conservative party insiders suggests that a two-tier media system is emerging between the small news operations that welcome digital handouts and the mainstream journalists who are opposed. Theoretical themes for international research include examining the implications of political image bytes such as the possible priming effect on journalists who are exposed to constant visual e-communication pushed by political offices. © The Author(s) 2012.","Canada; digital media; Flickr; framing; image management; media relations; photography; Stephen Harper",,,,,,,,,,"Adatto, K., (2008) Picture Perfect: Life in the Age of the Photo Op, , Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press; Berkowitz, D., Refining the gatekeeping metaphor for local television news (1990) Journal of Broadcasting & Electronic Media, 34 (1), pp. 55-68; Boorstin, D.J., (1992) The Image: A Guide to Pseudo-Events in America, , 25th Anniversary Edition.

In this article, we draw on several literatures to develop theories for how controversy related to new issues will emerge and expand in news coverage. Through a comprehensive content analysis of 101 local newspapers across the fifty U.S. states, we explore the dynamic and evolving process wherein a new issue-the HPV vaccine-emerged into public discourse and a legislative debate over school requirements for vaccination began. We find that coverage of controversy is a function of proximity, driven primarily by events within a state, although external events also influence local coverage. We also find that the legislative discussion in the media did not necessarily start out as controversial, but as the issue evolved, we observe a large increase in the proliferation of both actors taking positions and the types of arguments made to influence debate. The findings yield important insight into issue emergence with implications for how future research might test competing frames to better understand how the presentation of controversy in the mass media affects public opinion. © The Author(s) 2012.","health; media framing; news production; news reporting; political conflict",,,,,,"Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, RWJF

The analysis indicates that people are replacing traditional outlets, especially newspapers, with the Internet. At the same time, however, replacement is not a widespread phenomenon as yet. We find important replacement differences across newspapers and radio on the one hand and television on the other. We also report some of the first evidence regarding the attitudinal consequences of replacement behavior. © The Author(s) 2012.","Internet; media use; niche theory",,,,,,,,,,"Albarran, A., Dimmick, J., An Assessment of Utility and Competition Superiority in the Video Entertainment Industries (1993) Journal of Media Economics, 6, pp. 45-51; Althaus, S.L., Tewksbury, D., Patterns of Internet and Traditional News Media Use in a Networked Community (2000) Political Communication, 17, pp. 21-45; Althaus, S.L., Tewksbury, D., (2007) Toward a New Generation of Media Use Measures for the ANES, , Report to the Board of Overseers of the American National Election Studies; Ann Arbor, Michigan;; Bakker, P., Sádaba, C., The Impact of the Internet on Users (2008) The Internet and the Mass Media, pp. 86-101. , Kueng L.Picard R.

These changes and adaptations, often assembled under the catchword ""professionalization,"" become most apparent during electoral campaigns. However, the campaign professionalism of political parties has not yet been systematically ""measured,"" having been examined mostly in single case studies. Against this background, we present an empirical test of the party-centered theory of professionalization. Ours is a four-country comparison of the campaign structures and strategies of political parties during the most recent European parliamentary elections. Our analyses demonstrate a wide variety in professional electoral campaigning. There are differences in campaign structures that not only point to country specifics but also to the impact of the size of the parties. We also ask whether there are differences between parties owing to their position on a right-left scale. Our findings point to some general trends in electoral campaigning that seem to be typical of societies with democratic corporatist media systems. Those similarities and country-specifics should be taken into account in future empirical analyses, which might benefit from our methodological approach. © The Author(s) 2012.","comparison; electoral campaigning; European Parliament elections; political communication; political parties; professionalism",,,,,,"Austrian Science Fund, FWF: S10905-G11","We want to thank Marie Grussell (the University of Gothenburg) and Lars Nord (Mid Sweden University, Sundsvall) for their participation and for permission to use the Swedish data.

Evidence from a content analysis of climate change coverage on Fox News, CNN, and MSNBC during 2007 and 2008 demonstrates that Fox takes a more dismissive tone toward climate change than CNN and MSNBC. Fox also interviews a greater ratio of climate change doubters to believers. An analysis of 2008 survey data from a nationally representative sample of U.S. adults finds a negative association between Fox News viewership and acceptance of global warming, even after controlling for numerous potential confounding factors. Conversely, viewing CNN and MSNBC is associated with greater acceptance of global warming. Further analyses reveal that the relationship between cable news viewership (both Fox and CNN/MSNBC) and global warming acceptance is stronger among Republicans than among Democrats. That is, the views of Republicans are strongly linked with the news outlet they watch, regardless of how well that outlet aligns with their political predispositions. In contrast, Democrats don't vary much in their beliefs as a function of cable news use. This asymmetry suggests that some Republicans, who as a group tend to be predisposed toward global warming skepticism, are less skeptical when exposed to information on the reality and urgency of climate change. © The Author(s) 2012.","biased processing; cable news; climate change; global warming; motivated reasoning; persuasion; polarization; public opinion",,,,,,,"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was supported by the Yale Center for Environmental Law and Policy; the Betsy and Jesse Fink Foundation; the 11th Hour Project; and the Pacific Foundation.",,,"Aday, S., Livingston, S., Hebert, M., Embedding the Truth: A Cross-Cultural Analysis of Objectivity and Television Coverage of the Iraq War (2005) International Journal of Press/Politics, 10, pp. 3-21; Althaus, S., Tewksbury, D., (2007) Toward a New Generation of Media Use Measures for the ANES, , http://www.electionstudies.org/resources/papers/Pilot2006/nes011903.pdf, American National Election Studies Pilot Study Report, No. nes011903, (accessed April 15, 2011); Barker, D.C., Lawrence, A.B., Media Favoritism and Presidential Nominations: Reviving the Direct Effects Model (2006) Political Communication, 23, pp. 41-59; Bartels, L.M., Messages Received: The Political Impact of Media Exposure (1993) American Political Science Review, 87, pp. 267-285; Bennett, W.L., Iyengar, S., A New Era of Minimal Effects?

This study addresses this issue through multidimensional measurement of the aggressiveness of questions put to nine presidents (1953-2000) in news conferences. In addition to the familiar print/broadcast distinction, three largely unexamined attributes are explored: (1) organizational status (journalists affiliated with prominent vs. marginal news outlets), (2) interpersonal familiarity (frequent vs. infrequent news conference participants), and (3) gender (male vs. female journalists). The results indicate that print/broadcast and organizational status, which received the most attention in previous research, are the least consequential here. By contrast, previously unexamined attributes of familiarity and gender were more consequential. Frequent participants were in some respects more aggressive than infrequent participants. Female journalists were in some respects more aggressive than their male counterparts in the earlier part of the study period, but these differences attenuated over time. Explanations for these differences, which may include processes that govern entry into the press corps and/or subsequent on-the-job factors, are also discussed. © The Author(s) 2012.","journalistic norms; news conferences; presidency; White House press corps",,,,,,"National Science Foundation, NSF: SES-0112221","The authors disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article:This research was supported by grants from the National Science Foundation (Sociology panel SES-0112221), and the UCLA LeRoy Neiman Center for the Study of Culture.",,,"Aday, S., Livingston, S., Herbert, M., Embedding the Truth: A Cross-Cultural Analysis of Objectivity and Television Coverage of the Iraq War (2005) Harvard International Journal of Press/Politics, 10 (1), pp. 3-31; Bagdikian, B.H., (2004) The New Media Monopoly, , Boston: Beacon Press; Bakeman, R., Quera, V., McArthur, D., Robinson, B.F., Detecting Sequential Patterns and Determining Their Reliability with Fallible Observers (1997) Psychological Methods, 2, pp. 357-370; Benson, R., Neveu, E., (2005) Bourdieu and the Journalistic Field, , Cambridge: Polity; Brown, P., Levinson, S., (1987) Politeness: Some Universals in Language Usage, , Cambridge: Cambridge University Press; Chambers, D., Steiner, L., Fleming, C., (2004) Women and Journalism, , London: Routledge; Clancey, M., Robinson, M.J., The Media in Campaign '84: General Election Coverage, Part 1 (1985) Public Opinion, 8, pp. 49-54; Clayman, S.E., From Talk to Text: Newspaper Accounts of Reporter-Source Interactions (1990) Media, Culture, and Society, 12 (1), pp. 79-104; Clayman, S.E., Elliott, M., Heritage, J., Beckett, M., A Watershed in White House Journalism: Explaining the Post-1968 Rise of Aggressive Presidential News (2010) Political Communication, 27, pp. 229-247; Clayman, S.E., Elliott, M., Heritage, J., McDonald, L., Historical Trends in Questioning Presidents 1953-2000 (2006) Presidential Studies Quarterly, 36, pp. 561-583; Clayman, S., Heritage, J., (2002) The News Interview: Journalists and Public Figures on the Air, , Cambridge: Cambridge University Press; Clayman, S.E., Heritage, J., Questioning Presidents: Journalistic Deference and Adversarialness in the Press Conferences of U.S. Presidents Eisenhower and Reagan (2002) Journal of Communication, 52 (4), pp. 749-775; Clayman, S.E., Elliott, M., Heritage, J., McDonald, L., When Does the Watchdog Bark?

Because of structural bias in the news, government generally dominates this battle for media attention. This article argues, first, that the attention for government and parliament in the news reflects the power balance in the political system and, second, that this relation is moderated by cross-national differences in journalistic cultures, in particular the importance of conflict framing. Content analysis of newspaper and television coverage in Denmark, Germany, the United Kingdom, and Spain (N = 1,306 stories) shows that because of the universal news value of political power, attention for government and parliament reinforces differences of political power of these institutions, both within countries and cross-nationally. However, in pragmatic journalistic cultures, the dominance of government is weakened by journalists' search for conflict. In countries where the news value of conflict is more important (Denmark and the United Kingdom), stories about government more often include oppositional voices than in countries where conflict is a less important news value (Spain). © The Author(s) 2012.","comparative; conflict framing; content analysis; government; legislators; structural bias",,,,,,"Samfund og Erhverv, Det Frie ForskningsrÃ¥d, FSE, DFF","The author disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: The research was supported through a grant from the Danish Social Science Research Council.",,,"Alexseev, M.A., Lance, B.W., For Whom the Gates Open: News Reporting and Government Source Patterns in the United Kingdom, Great Britain, and Russia (1995) Political Communication, 12 (4), pp. 395-412; Althaus, S.L., When News Norms Collide, Follow the Lead: New Evidence for Press Independence (2003) Political Communication, 20, pp. 381-414; Arnold, R.D., (2004) Congress, the Press, and Political Accountability, , Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press; Bennett, W.L., An Introduction to Journalism Norms and Representations of Politics (1996) Political Communication, 13, pp. 373-384; Bennett, W.L., Lawrence, R.G., Steven, L., (2007) When the Press Fails.

It enables a look at how media is both an essential resource of political power and a crucial factor in the environment in which political power works. Drawing on a qualitative interview sample of 60 elite decision makers and an elite survey (N = 419), Finnish decision making is found to be quite thoroughly mediatized. Mediatization is differentiated in distinct actor profiles found with Latent Class Analysis of the survey data. The most prominent pattern seems to be that mediatization correlates with other power resources. Those who have official status and are actively involved in policy networks also make use of media resources, and to differing extents adapt their actions to the demands of the media. However, there are also groups of decision makers who still seem to be quite independent of the media. © The Author(s) 2012.","journalism; Latent Class Analysis; Mediatization; Parsons; policy networks; power; professionalization",,,,,,"Helsingin Sanomain SÃ¤Ã¤tiÃ¶","The authors disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This study was supported by a grant from the Helsingin Sanomat Foundation.",,,"Asp, K., (1986) Mäktiga Massmedier.

As expected, reporting was found to be distinctive across beat clusters, with political reporters employing significantly and consistently higher standards although financial reporters, in contrast to expectations, were not found to be the weakest link in the reporting chain.

We differentiate between political and non-political uses of both ""traditional"" and ""new"" media, and situate political extremity within a new conceptualization of public-egocentric publics -a meso-level phenomenon enabled by new communication technologies that overcomes the traditional dichotomy of small groups and mass publics. Testing the relationship between information, expression, and extremity in Colombia, a sociopolitical context with high levels of polarization and distrust, we find that traditional media use is mostly unrelated to the tested forms of extremity: party-, ideology-, or issue-based. In turn, expressive Internet use is related to extremity and-contrary to what some commentators have feared-this relationship is negative. Lower extremity associated with online expression is consistent with the notion of egocentric publics advanced in this article. The results underscore the importance of differentiating between various media formats in political communication research, reveal the media correlates of various forms of extremity can take, and provide evidence that the emerging publics made possible by new media are not necessarily polarizing. © The Author(s) 2011.","extremity; ideology; Internet; media effects; party identity; radio; television",,,,,,,"The authors disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: The survey on which the article is based was funded through a research grant awarded to Hernando Rojas by the Graduate School of the University of Wisconsin Madison.",,,"Abelson, R., (1995) Attitude Strength: Antecedents and Consequences, pp. 25-41. , Petty R.Krosnick J., ed., Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum; Abramowitz, A., Saunders, K., Why Can't We All Just Get Along?

Of course, single and subjective experiences are also a form of ""evidence"" but they are of a different kind and of a different quality because they often are not measurable, not quantifiable, and not repeatable. Thus, they are nontheoretical in a sense as described above. This article takes a look at what communication research can offer to PR practice. Three main services are discussed: (1) modeling the field and its variables, (2) providing methods for the measurement of PR effectiveness, and (3) measuring PR effectiveness and its quality. © The Author(s) 2011.","journalistic norms; professionalism; public sphere",,,,,,,,,,"Adams, W., Marrying the Functions.

Our case study is a controversial, high-ratings episode of BBC Question Time, the weekly British political debate show, in October 2009, in which Nick Griffin, leader of the far-right British National Party, appeared as a panelist. The ""viewertariat"" emerging around such a political event affords the opportunity to explore interaction across media formats. We examine both the structural elements of engagement online and the expressions of collective identity expressed in tweets. Although many concerns noted in previous studies of online political engagement remain (inequality in the propensity to comment, coarseness of tone), we find certain notable characteristics in the sample, especially a direct link between the quantity of tweets and events on the screen, an ability to preempt the arguments offered by panelists, and ways in which viewertariat members add new content to the discussion. Furthermore, Twitter users commenting online express a range of overlapping identities. These complexities challenge broadcasting and political institutions seeking to integrate new, more organic models of engagement. © The Author(s) 2011.","media audiences; news events; political participation; public opinion; public sphere; television debates",,,,,,,,,,"Ampofo, L., Anstead, N., O'Loughlin, B., Trust, Confidence, Credibility: Citizen Responses on Twitter to Opinion Polls during the 2010 UK General Election Information, Communication & Society; Anderson, C., (2006) The Long Tail: Why the Future of Business Is Selling Less of More, , New York: Hyperion; Anstead, N., The Internet and Campaign Finance in the US and the UK: An Institutional Comparison (2008) Journal of Information Technology and Politics, 5 (3); Anstead, N., Chadwick, A., Parties, Election Campaigning and the Internet: Toward a Comparative Institutional Approach (2008) The Handbook of Internet Politics, , Chadwick A.Howard P.

Although benefits were heavily concentrated at the very top of the income and wealth distributions, majorities of Americans appeared to support the tax cuts, and just as important, oppositional public opinion was muted. An innovative content analysis of national television news coverage informed by the concepts of particularistic versus collective benefits reveals the interests and sources represented, and subtle ways media framing favored George W. Bush's tax proposals of 2001 and 2003. The authors find that media framing did not provide citizens with the information necessary for balanced assessment of either the effects on their own individual economic interests, or of impacts on widely shared, collective (i.e., sociotropic) values. Instead, by framing the tax cuts' putative collective benefits in terms of economic growth while neglecting the likelihood of greater inequality, and by deemphasizing the skewed particularistic benefits, broadcast coverage diminished citizens' ability to deliberate effectively over taxation policy. As a result, television news shaped an environment favorable to tax policies that exacerbated economic inequality in the United States and rendered America an outlier in income distribution among wealthy democracies. © The Author(s) 2011.","George W.

This article assesses to what extent do these forms of digital discussion fit in Habermas' principles for democratic debate, using his discursive ethics as a demanding normative benchmark. The sample of more than 15,000 comments was selected from the online versions of five national newspapers of record from different political and journalistic contexts: The Guardian (United Kingdom), Le Monde (France), The New York Times (United States), El País (Spain), and La Repubblica (Italy). The ethical guidelines and legal frameworks set up by the newspapers as well as their moderation strategies were considered to understand the different settings of the conversations. Two models of audience participation emerge from the analysis, one where communities of debate are formed based on mostly respectful discussions between diverse points of view and another of homogenous communities, in which expressing feelings about current events dominates the contributions and there is less of an argumentative debate. © The Author(s) 2011.","audience participation; comments in news; discursive ethics; participatory journalism; public sphere; user-generated content",,,,,,"CSO2009-13713-C05-04","The authors disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This article is part of the results of the project “Evolution of online journalism in Spain in the context of convergence.” funded by the Ministry of Science of Spain (code: CSO2009-13713-C05-04).",,,"Bakker, P., Pentti, M., (2009) Beyond News: User-Generated Content on Dutch Media Websites, , Paper Presented at the Future of Journalism conference, Cardiff University; Cardiff, Wales; 2009; Barber, B., (2006) How Democratic Are the New Telecommunication Technologies?, p. 6. , http://www.uoc.edu/idp/3/dt/esp/barber.html, IDP: Revista de los Estudios de Derecho y Ciencia Política de la UOCV. 3; (2008) The Use of the Internet by America's Largest Newspapers (2008 Edition), , http://www.bivings.com/thelab/presentations/2008study.pdf, Biving Group; Bruns, A., (2005) Gatewatching: Collaborative Online News Production, , New York: Peter Lang; Chung, D.S., Profits and Perils: Online News Producers' Perceptions of Interactivity and Uses of Interactive Features (2007) Convergence, 13 (1), pp. 43-61; Cohen, J., A Coefficient of Agreement for Nominal Scales (1960) Educational and Psychological Measurement, 20 (1), pp. 37-46; Craveri, B., (2005) The Age of Conversation, , New York: News York Review Books; Dahlberg, L., Democracy via Cyberspace: Mapping the Rhetorics and Practices of Three Prominent Camps (2001) New Media and Society, 3 (2), pp. 157-177; Dewey, J., (1991) The Public and Its Problems, , Athens: Swallow Press; Domingo, D., (2011) Participatory Journalism: Guarding Open Gates in Online Newspapers, , Singer Jane B., ed., New York: Wiley-Blackwell; Ferrara, K., Brunner, H., Whittemore, G., Interactive Written Discourse as an Emergent Register (1991) Written Communication, 8 (1), pp. 8-34; Fumaroli, M., (1998) L'école Du Silence, , Paris: Flammarion; Goss, B.M., Online 'Looney Tunes': An Analysis of Reader-Composed Comment Threads (2007) The Nation Journalism Studies, 8 (3), pp. 365-381; Habermas, J., (1984) The Theory of Communicative Action, , Boston: Beacon; Habermas, J., (1992) Moral Consciousness and Communicative Action, , Cambridge: Polity Press; Hallin, D.C., Mancini, P., (2004) Comparing Media Systems: Three Models of Media and Politics, , Cambridge: Cambridge University Press; Heller, A., (1987) Beyond Justice, , New York: Blackwell; Hermida, A., Thurman, N., A Clash of Cultures: The Integration of User-Generated Content within Professional Journalistic Frameworks at British Newspaper Websites (2008) Journalism Practice, 2 (3), pp. 343-356; Neuberger, C., Nuernbergk, C., Competition, Complimentarity or Integration?

This article examines the professionalization of central government communication in Germany, Spain, and the United Kingdom, applying a framework developed using indicators derived from the sociology of work and from the strategic planning and quality literature. Results show that there are clear indices of the development of formal rules governing the practice of policy-or information-related government communication, distinguishing it from more partisan, politicized communication. Although mechanisms are being introduced to improve the process of communication, practices are still far from being fully systematized. The analysis provides evidence that professionalization as indicated by the establishment of specialist education, of self-regulation, and of formal organization of communication processes can be found at varying speeds in the three countries. The article finally discusses whether the logic of professionalism is compatible with government communication that is manipulative. © The Author(s) 2011.","comparative research; professionalism; Western Europe",,,,,,,,,,"Álvarez, J.L., Pascual, E.M., Las competencias de liderazgo de los residentes de Gobierno en España (2002) Revista De Estudios Políticos (Nueva Época), 116, pp. 267-279; Blumler, J.G., (1990) Public Communication: The New Imperatives.

Evidence is based on journalists' survey responses to a six-dimensional scale, covering political, economic, organizational, professional, and procedural influences as well as influences from reference groups. The results confirm the expectation that political and economic factors are clearly the most important denominators of cross-national differences in the journalists' perceptions of influences. Furthermore, perceived political influences are clearly related to objective indicators of political freedom and ownership structures across the investigated countries. Economic influences seem to have a stronger impact in private and state-owned media than in public newsrooms, but they are not related to a country's economic freedom. With respect to organizational, professional, and procedural influences as well as the impact of reference groups, the differences between the countries turned out to be much smaller. © The Author(s) 2011.","comparative research; journalists; perceived influences; survey",,,,,,,,,,"Altmeppen, K.-D., The Structure of News Production: The Organizational Approach to Journalism Research (2008) Global Journalism Research: Theories, Methods, Findings, Future, , In, ed.

Most empirical agenda-setting studies using time-series analyses found that the media matter for the political agenda, but the size of the found media effects remains often modest. This nuanced view on media impact seems to contradict with the perceptions of politicians. Our comparative survey of members of parliament in four small parliamentary democracies-Belgium, Netherlands, Sweden, and Denmark-shows that they consider the mass media to be one of the key political agenda setters directly competing with the Prime Minister and the powerful political parties. This article further explores the inconsistency between ""objective""and ""subjective""findings.We develop six possible explanations for the contradicting findings produced by both methods and formulate concrete suggestions to improve both methods and diminish the gap between them. © The Author(s) 2011.","MP survey; Political Agenda-setting; Time-series",,,,,,,,,,"Bennett, W.L., Lawrence, R.G., Livingston, S., (2007) When the Press Fails.

This article examines how two of the most preeminent U.S. newspapers-New York Times and Washington Post-editorially invoked Tiananmen as a ""news icon""in the past twenty years. We contend that the meanings of Tiananmen were reconstructed over twenty years partly but not completely in line with the changes in the United States' policy toward China. Specifically, Tiananmen symbolized Communist dictatorship in the initial years after 1989 and then became an example of China's human rights abuse in the late 1990s. Into the 2000s, the significance of Tiananmen faded away. But it remained as part of United States' ritualistic memory of China's repression that invokes the moral bottom line of U.S. foreign policy. In theoretical terms, this study shows how a news icon, in the course of an extended life cycle, may exhibit both continuities and changes in its meanings, and there can also be subtle variations in the relationships between a news icon and the dominant power structure over time. © The Author(s) 2011.","media discourses; news icon; the press and foreign policy,Tiananmen; U.S.-China relationship",,,,,,,,,,"Akhavan-Majid, R., Ramaprasad, J., Framing and Ideology: A Comparative Analysis of U.S. and Chinese Newspaper Coverage of the Fourth United Nations Conference on Women and the NGO Forum (1998) Mass Communication and Society, 1 (3-4), pp. 131-152; Bennett, W.L., Toward a Theory of Press-State Relations in the United States (1990) Journal of Communication, 40 (2), pp. 103-125; Bennett, W.L., Lawrence, R.G., News Icons and the Mainstreaming of Social Change (1995) Journal of Communication, 45 (3), pp. 20-39; Bennett, W.L., Lawrence, R.G., Livingston, S., (2007) When the Press Fails, , Chicago: University of Chicago Press; Chang, T.K., The News and US-China Policy: Symbols in Newspapers and Documents (1988) Journalism Quarterly, 65 (2), pp. 320-327; Chang, T.K., The Impact of Presidential Statements on Press Editorials Regarding US-China Policy, 1950-1984 (1989) Communication Research, 16 (4), pp. 486-509; Chinoy, M., Tiananmen Part, But Not All, of Modern-Day China's Legacy (1999) CNN Special Reports, , http://edition.cnn.com/SPECIALS/views/y/1999/06/chinoy.tiananmen.jun2/, (2 June); (1996) Global News-Rooms, Local Audiences, , Cohen, Akiba A., Mark R.

After tracking attention to five different issues-crime, unemployment, health, poverty, and education-we estimate both average and issue-specific agenda-setting effects using time-series, cross-sectional ordinary least squares (OLS) regressions. The results show that there are multidirectional influences between the public, television news, and the president. Both the public and the president appeared responsive to prior news coverage, and while news coverage was not influenced by public attention, it was affected by presidential rhetoric. While these processes differed from one issue to another, overall there was a top-down pattern of agenda adoption: Policy preferences are ""negotiated""between the president and the news media, with no noticeable input from the public. From a comparative perspective, the evidence shows that television news in Chile are considerably powerful and that citizens' priorities are basically ignored by the elites, although their maneuvering is still constrained by objective conditions. © The Author(s) 2011.","agenda setting; media effects; policymaking; public opinion; South America",,,,,,,,,,"Alves, R., From Lapdog to Watchdog: The Role of the Press in Latin American Democratization (2005) Making Journalists, pp. 181-201. , In, ed.

The organizers of the protests faced a particular rhetorical challenge: to craft a message that would be well received by both hostile and friendly audiences. In addition to attracting significant media coverage, the actions sparked both celebration and criticism in public commentary. Three key themes were identified based on primary texts from protest organizers and existing research on media coverage of political protest: economy; policy/rights; and law/order. Linguistic representations of these themes were constructed and keywords were searched across a corpus of newspaper front pages and television transcripts to identify general trends. These trends were then analyzed at the level of sentence and utterance. Our findings illustrate the particular challenges of polysemy for social movements that seek to use mass media to advance their political goals in an increasingly fragmented media environment, as well as the persistence of some aspects of the ""protest paradigm""in media coverage. © The Author(s) 2011.","audience reception; political protest; polysemy; social movements",,,,,,,,,,"Arpan, L.M., Baker, K., Youngwon, L., Taejin, J., Lorusso, L., Smith, J., News Coverage of Social Protests and the Effects of Photographs and Prior Attitudes (2006) Mass Communication and Society, 9 (1), pp. 1-20; Baker, P., (2006) Using Corpora in Discourse Analysis, , London: Continuum; Barnhurst, K.G., The makers of meaning: National Public Radio and the new long journalism, 1980-2000 (2003) Political Communication, 20 (1), pp. 1-22; Benson, R., What Makes for a Critical Press?

Parliamentarians need to pay attention to the norms and demands of the media and conform to the 'media logic'. Politicians allegedly lose communicative autonomy in their interaction with the media and the literature suggests that they regret this development. The consequences of this mediatization process are rarely studied empirically, however. Using two elite surveys this article studies Danish MPs' interaction with and attitudes toward the media in 1980 and 2000. As expected, the evidence shows that MPs appear more often in the media in 2000 than in 1980, and that they have come to perceive the media as a more autonomous political actor. Contrary to expectations, MPs have not become more critical toward the media in general and they have become even more satisfied with the media coverage of their own activities as MPs. On the individual level, the increased satisfaction is correlated with media appearances which again correlate with seniority, position, and party affiliation. The evidence suggests that parliamentarians are not puppets of the media-at least some of them are in a position to take advantage of the mediatization of politics. © The Author(s) 2011.","Denmark; mediatization; members of parliament; press-politics relation",,,,,,,,,,"van Aelst, P., Brandts, K., van Praag, P., de Vreese, C., Nuytemans, M., van Dalen, A., The Fourth Estate as a Superpower?

Indonesian journalists play a vital role. Since the collapse of the Suharto regime in the late 1990s, the Indonesian media sector has experienced its own revolution. A nationwide survey of 600 Indonesian journalists finds that while the influence of Islam in the newsroom is increasing, journalists support the separation of mosque and state and reject militant Islam. Their attitude toward the United States has improved under Obama and, while skeptical of American motives, they support continued American aid. Although most reject Suharto-era government-mouthpiece media functions, they have not yet fully embraced the role of watchdog. They say that the industry as a whole, and they as individuals, are still not free, but cite their own lack of professionalism and poor ethics as the greatest threat to their industry. The echo of the development journalism model that prevailed in the Suharto years can be seen in the top priorities of Indonesian journalists. © The Author(s) 2011.","attitudes; Indonesia; Islam; journalism; journalists",,,,,,,,,,"(2010) AJI Documents 40 Cases of Violence against Media Workers in 12 Months, , Jakarta: Alliance of Independent Journalists; Astraatmadja, A., (1997) Pers Indonesia Kekurangan Wartawan (Deficiencies of Indonesian Journalists), , http://www.tempo.co.id/ang/min/02/25/kolom4.htm; (2006) BBC/Reuters/Media Center Poll: Trust in the Media, , http://www.globescan.com/news_archives/bbcreut.html, May 3, 2006, GlobeScan; Frederick, W.H., Worden, R.L., Indonesia: A Country Study (1993) Area Handbook Series, , In .5th Edition, Washington, D.C.: Federal Research Division for Sale by the Supt. of Docs., U.S. G.P.O; Hanitzsch, T., Journalists in Indonesia: Educated but Timid Watchdogs (2005) Journalism Studies, 6 (4), p. 493; Hardjono, R., Indonesia Media Still Censoring Itself (52, 3, 51) (1998) Nieman Reports, , http://www.nieman.harvard.edu/reportsitem.aspx?id=102330; Hefner, R.W., Religious Ironies in East Timor (2000) Religion in the News, 3 (1); Hefner, R.W., Global Violence and Indonesian Muslim Politics (2002) American Anthropologist, 104 (3), p. 754; Herrscher, R., A Universal Code of Journalism Ethics: Problems, Limitations, and Proposals (2002) Journal of Mass Media Ethics, 17 (4), p. 227; Juniartha, I.W., (2010) Activists Resume Opposition to Pornography Bill, , Mar. 26, The Jakarta Post; Kohut, A., (2009) 25-Nation Pew Global Attitudes Survey, , Washington, D.C.: Pew Global Attitudes Project; Pemberitaan Soal Pengeboman Ritz Carlton-Marriott Tak Penuhi Prinsip Jurnalisme (2009) Tempo Interaktif, , KPI, (Problems in coverage of Ritz Carlton-Marriott bombings do not meet the principles of journalism); Aliansi Jurnalis Independen Indonesia (2010) Indonesian Press Freedom Report.

The study focused on the portrayal of Muslim-Christian tensions, in particular, as an especially sensitive and controversial issue to explore the extent to which the postings on these blogs reflect a new form of vibrant and dynamic virtual public sphere, and the degree to which this newly constructed virtual public sphere conforms to, or deviates from, the idealized Habermasian public sphere. Our analysis showed that although there was a genuine Habermasian public sphere reflected in some of the threads on the two blogs, there was a general lack of rational-critical debates, reciprocal deliberations, and communicative action as envisioned by Habermas. It also showed that this newly (re)envisioned virtual public sphere aimed to revitalize civil society, through broadening the base of popular participation, which in turn led to boosting and expanding the concept of citizen journalism, beyond the official sphere of mainstream media. © The Author(s) 2011.","citizen journalism; civil society; Egypt; Habermas; Muslim-Christian Discourses; new media; political blogging; public sphere",,,,,,,,,,"Bohman, J., Expanding Dialogue: The Internet, the Public Sphere and Prospects for Transnational Democracy (2004) After Habermas: New Perspectives on the Public Sphere, pp. 131-155. , In, ed.

How media outlets construct their reports have direct consequences for what people think about politics. Scholars and pundits have long debated about the factors that shape media choices. Yet there have been few direct investigations into how three major determinants shape political news: world events, advocacy groups, and the government. This article examines the relative impact of these factors by focusing on the construction of news related to energy conservation in the United States. Specifically, it looks at how events, messages crafted by interest groups, and government-sponsored public service announcements (PSAs) affect news frames and attributions of responsibility for the extant energy situation. It finds that events are the most important factor driving news coverage; advocacy groups are second, followed by PSAs. This suggests that news about conservation is driven more by events than messages supplied by agents seeking to influence public discourse. Thus, groups with specific agendas such as government and advocacy organizations can, at least at times, be limited in terms of their capacity to shape news coverage-which has implications for theories of media choice. © The Author(s) 2011.","energy conservation; framing; media; news construction",,,,,,,,,,"Ajzen, I., Fishbein, M., (1980) Understanding Attitudes and Predicting Social Behavior, , Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice-Hall; Ajzen, I., Fishbein, M., The Influence of Attitudes on Behaviors (2005) The Handbook of Attitudes, , In, ed.

The article introduces a conceptual framework demonstrating the relationship between metanarrative and national narratives and applies it to the case of Mohammad al-Dura in September 2000. It analyses items from two Israeli newspapers (Yediot Aharonot and Ha'aretz) and three Palestinian newspapers (al-Quds, Alayam, and al-Hayat al-Jadida) as well as news reports published online by two Israeli portals, YNET and WALLA!, and the talkbacks received in response to the coverage. The analysis illustrates the role the media, and more specifically Palestinian regular media and the Israeli talkbacks, have played in amplifying the national narratives and reinforcing the colliding metanarratives. On the other hand, the Israeli media have, by and large, proved the article's thesis that narratives in an identity conflict can be handled differently. By deconstructing the narrative to its constitutive components, raising questions regarding the reliability of one's own national/official version, and showing readiness to incorporate the narrative of the ""other""into one's own narrative, the media have played a potentially positive role in the reconciliation process between Israelis and Palestinians. © The Author(s) 2011.","media framing; Middle East; peace",,,,,,,,,,"Abdul-Mageed, M.M., Online News Sites and Journalism 2.0: Reader Comments on Al Jazeera Arabic (2008) TripleC, 6 (2), pp. 59-76; Alimi, E., Discursive Contention: Palestinian Media Discourse and the Inception of the 'First' Intifada (2007) Press/Politics, 12 (4), pp. 71-91; Auerbach, Y., Conflict Resolution, Forgiveness and Reconciliation in Material and Identity Conflicts (2005) Humboldt Journal of Social Relations, 29 (2), pp. 41-80; Auerbach, Y., The Reconciliation Pyramid: A Narrative-Based Framework for Analyzing Identity Conflicts (2009) Political Psychology, 30 (2), pp. 291-318; Barkan, E., (2000) The Guilt of Nations: Restitution and Negotiating Historical Injustices, , New York, NY: Norton; Barkan, E., Considerations toward Accepting Historical Responsibility (2005) Exile and Return: Predicaments of Palestinians and Jews, pp. 85-105. , In, ed.

In addition, it explores whether the media contribute to increasing the existent knowledge gap in the Spanish polity. The results show that only one medium appears to have significant effects on knowledge: newspapers. An additional finding is that exposure to political information in newspapers does not reinforce the knowledge gap between different socioeconomic groups. Moreover, the relationship between education and knowledge appears to be weaker among heavy newspaper users than among light newspaper users. Interestingly, this result runs contrary to that predicted by the knowledge gap hypothesis and suggests that political institutions should promote increased access to the press for poorly educated citizens, particularly in countries where there is an extremely polarized media system, with a clear political alignment of the main media holdings, such as the case of Spain. © The Author(s) 2011.","knowledge gap; media effects; political knowledge; Western Europe",,,,,,,,,,"Althaus, S., (2003) Collective Preferences in Democratic Politics, , Cambridge: Cambridge University Press; Barnhurst, K.G., Political Engagement and the Audience for News: Lessons from Spain (2000) Journalism and Communication Monographs, 2 (1), pp. 7-60; Bennet, S., Americans' Knowledge of Ideology, 1980-1992 (1995) American Politics Quarterly, 23 (3), pp. 259-278; Carpini, M.X., Keeter, S., (1996) What Americans Know about Politics and Why It Matters, , New Haven: Yale University Press; Chan, T.W., Goldthorpe, J.H., Social Status and Newspaper Readership (2007) American Journal of Sociology, 112 (4), pp. 1095-1134; Craig, S.C., Kane, J.G., Gainous, J., Issue-Related Learning in a Gubernatorial Campaign: A Panel Study (2005) Political Communication, 22 (4), pp. 483-503; Curran, J., Iyengar, S., Lund, A.B., Salovaara-Moring, I., Media System, Public Knowledge and Democracy.

Climate Summits are seen as ample opportunities to study journalism at the global level and simultaneously the relation between global and local perspectives. It demonstrates how main national actors within the political field exercise their hegemony toward the press and that the Norwegian leaders in Bali are partly framed as global heroes. But it furthermore reveals how a critical scrutiny of Norway's role as a major oil polluter emerges in the press in opposition to the hero framing. Thus, a distinction between different modes of journalistic domestication is made, which invites more critical scrutiny of Climate Change actors both within the confines of the nation-state and more globally. The investigation is based on textual analysis as well as framing theory-and on perspectives of hegemony and ""good sense"" within the journalistic field. © 2011 The Author(s).","Climate change; Domestication; Global news events; Hegemony and resistance; Journalism; Media framing; Nation; News event",,,,,,,,,,"Almlid, O.E., Saltbones, I., (1996) Groupies for Gro: En Kvalitativ Analyse Av Forholdet Mellom Statsminister Gro Harlem Brundtland Og Norsk Presse [Groupies for Gro: A Qualitative Analysis of the Relationship between Prime Minister Gro Harlem Brundtland and the Norwegian Press], , Oslo, Norway: Journalism Programme; Appiah, K.A., (2007) Cosmopolitanism: Ethics in a World of Strangers, , London: Penguin; Austin, A., Advancing Accumulation and Managing Its Discontents: The U.S Anti-environmental Countermovement (2002) Sociological Spectrum, 22, pp. 71-105; Bellamy Foster, J., (2002) Ecology against Capitalism, , New York: Monthly Review Press; Berglez, P., Höjier, B., Olausson, U., Individualisation and Nationalization of the Climate Issue (2009) Climate Change and the Media, , In, ed.

This paper distinguishes three sets of criteria for journalistic 'performance': ethical (P1), commercial (P2) and theatrical (P3). These are elaborated in turn with respect to their industrial origins, their underlying conceptions of the public interest, their political implications and their productive consequences. The three-template model extends Franklin's (2003) critique of McJournalism by: a) providing a fuller account of the (P2) McDonaldization of television news, b) more precisely demarcating backstage (P2) and frontstage (P3) elements of journalistic performance, and c) elaborating a new P3 news template with reference to Bryman's (2004) work on Disneyization. The paper concludes with a New Zealand case study highlighting tensions between P2 and P3 modes of performance and audience outcomes. © 2011 The Author(s).","Disneyization; Infotainment; McDonaldization; Television news",,,,,,,,,,"Allen, C., Discovering 'Joe Six Pack' Content in Television News: The Hidden History of Audience Research, News Consultants, and the Warner Class Model (2005) Journal of Broadcasting and Electronic Media, 49 (4), pp. 363-382; Asher, E.G., Letter to the Editor (1999) TV Guide (NZ), , Feb. 19; Atkinson, J., The 'Americanization' of One Network News (1994) Australasian Journal of American Studies, 13 (1), pp. 1-26; Atkinson, J., Citizenship and Parasocial Dysfunction in the TVNZ Family: The Hawkesby Debacle (2000) Revisioning Citizenship for the Twenty-First Century, pp. 17-26. , Hamilton, New Zealand: Centre for New Zealand Jurisprudence, University of Waikato School of Law; Atkinson, J., The Campaign on Television (2004) Voters' Veto: The 2002 Election in New Zealand and the Consolidation of Minority Government, pp. 48-67. , In ed.

Drawing on the literature on mediatization, media interventionism, political news journalism and related areas, the purpose of this article is to develop indicators of the degree to which news content is mediatized, and test these in a comparative content analysis of how Swedish and US television news covered the 2006 Swedish and 2008 US election campaigns. The results show that election news on US television is more mediatized than that on Swedish television, as expected. However, few differences were found across commercial and public service television news within Sweden. The study also suggests that the mediatization of news content may be moderated by national journalism cultures, political news cultures and political communication cultures. © The Author(s) 2011.","comparative research; election news; media interventionism; mediatization",,,,,,,,,,"Altheide, D.L., Snow, R.P., (1979) Media Logic, , Beverly Hills, CA: Sage; Altheide, D.L., Snow, R.P., Toward a Theory of Mediation (1988) Communication Yearbook 11, , In, ed.

First, it builds upon previous theory by conceptualizing and measuring political cynicism at both issue-specific and global levels. Second, the contingency of framing effects is a contested but crucial area of the framing paradigm and deserves greater attention in strategic framing studies. The study therefore examines this in detail by testing a number of individual characteristics for their moderating effects. The author found that relative to issue-based coverage, strategic news frames increased issue-specific political cynicism, but this effect was only evident for those who were less politically engaged and knowledgeable. The effects of the strategy frame on more global measures of political cynicism were minimal. The findings are discussed in the light of ongoing debates about framing effects and the media's role in democratic engagement. © 2011 The Author(s).","Journalism; Media effects; Media framing; Political attitudes; Western Europe",,,,,,,,,,"Almond, G., Verba, S., (1963) The Civic Culture: Political Attitudes and Democracy in Five Nations, , Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press; Ansolabehere, S., Iyengar, S., (1995) Going Negative: How Attack Ads Shrink and Polarize the Electorate, , New York, NY: Free Press; Aronson, E.P.C., Ellsworth, J.M.C., Gonzales, M., (1990) Methods of Research in Social Psychology, , 2nd Edition, New York, NY: McGraw-Hill; Bartle, J., Why Labour Won-Again (2002) Britain at the Polls 2001, , In, ed.

Quickly labeled ""bullygate,"" it centered on Brown's alleged psychological and physical mistreatment of colleagues working inside his office in Number 10, Downing Street. These were potentially some of the most damaging allegations ever to be made about the personal conduct of a sitting British prime minister, and bullygate was a national and international news phenomenon. This study provides an analysis of the processes of mediation during the affair. It is based on close, real-time observation and logging of a wide range of press, broadcast, and online material, as the story broke, evolved, and faded, over a five-day period. The study reveals the increasingly hybridized nature of news systems and argues that traditional understandings of the ""news cycle"" should now be replaced by a broader concern with the ""political information cycle."" Political information cycles are complex assemblages in which the personnel, practices, genres, technologies, and temporalities of supposedly ""new"" online media are hybridized with those of supposedly ""old"" broadcast and press media. This hybridization now decisively shapes power relations among news actors. The combination of news professionals' dominance and the integration of nonelite actors in the construction and contestation of news at multiple points in a political information cycle's life span are important characteristics of contemporary political communication. © 2011 The Author(s).","Assemblages; Blogs; Broadcasting; Internet; Media hybridity; News cycle; Newspapers; Political information cycle; Power; Television; Time; Twitter",,,,,,,,,,"Barnett, S., Ivor, G., (2001) Westminster Tales: The 21st Century Crisis in British Political Journalism, , London: Continuum; Bell, A., News Time (1995) Time & Society, 4 (3), pp. 305-328; Boczkowski Pablo, J., de Martin, S., When More Media Equals Less News: Patterns of Content Homogenization in Argentina's Leading Print and Online Newspapers (2007) Political Communication, 24 (2), pp. 167-180; Callaghan, K., Frauke, S., Assessing the Democratic Debate: How the News Media Frame Elite Policy Discourse (2001) Political Communication, 18 (2), pp. 183-212; Chadwick, A., Digital Network Repertoires and Organizational Hybridity (2007) Political Communication, 24 (3), pp. 283-301; Davies, N., (2008) Flat Earth News: An Award-Winning Reporter Exposes Falsehood, Distortion and Propaganda in the Global Media, , London: Chatto & Windus; Davies, S., (2009) UK Journalists on Twitter Update,, , http://stedavies.com/2009/10/uk-journalists-on-twitter-update/, (last accessed May 13,), Stedavies.com; Davis, A., New Media and Fat Democracy: The Paradox of Online Participation (2010) New Media and Society, 12 (5), pp. 745-761; Davis, R., (2009) Typing Politics: The Role of Blogs in American Politics, , New York: Oxford University Press; DeLanda, M., (2006) A New Philosophy of Society: Assemblage Theory and Social Complexity, , London: Continuum; Galtung, J., Mari Holmboe, R., The Structure of Foreign News: The Presentation of the Congo, Cuba, and Cyprus in Four Norwegian Newspapers (1965) Journal of Peace Research, 2 (1), pp. 64-90; Herbert, J., Deciding What's News: A Study of CBS Evening News, NBC Nightly News, Newsweek, and Time (1979) 25th Anniversary 2004 Edition, , Gans, New York: Pantheon; Garcia Aviles, J., Bienvenido, L., Karen, S., Jackie, H., Journalists at Digital Television Newsrooms in Britain and Spain: Workflow and Multi-Skilling in a Competitive Environment (2004) Journalism Studies, 5 (1), pp. 87-100; Golding, P., Philip, E., (1979) Making the News, , London: Longman; Hoskins, A., O'Loughlin, B., (2007) Television and Terror: Conflicting Times and the Crisis of News Discourse, , Basingstoke: Palgrave Macmillan; Hoskins, A., O'Loughlin, B., (2010) War and Media: The Emergence of Diffused War, , Cambridge: Polity; Howe, J., (2008) Crowdsourcing: How the Power of the Crowd Is Driving the Future of Business, , New York: Crown; Jones Alex, S., (2009) Losing the News: The Future of the News That Feeds Democracy, , New York: Oxford University Press; Klinenberg, E., Convergence: News Production in a Digital Age (2005) Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science, 597, pp. 48-64; Kovach, B., Tom, R., (1999) Warp Speed: America in the Age of Mixed Media, , New York: Century Foundation Press; Kreiss, D., Taking Our Country Back?

It looks at the choices of both groups in relation to each other and explores whether these choices vary in connection with the occurrence of major political events. The heuristic value of this approach is demonstrated through a mixed-method study of the news choices of journalists and consumers in the main Argentine online sites. A content analysis of the top stories chosen by journalists of that country's two leading sites and the stories that consumers of these sites click most often yields two key results. First, during periods of relatively normal political activity, journalists choose stories about political, international, and economic subjects substantively more than consumers. Second, during periods of heightened political activity, consumers increase their interest in these stories, and the gap with the choices of journalists either disappears or narrows. Furthermore, interviews with journalists and with news consumers show that the presence of this gap during ordinary political times and its change during extraordinary periods are shaped by divergent and dynamic interpretive logics. © The Author(s) 2010.","Argentina; Internet; Latin America; new media; online journalism; online news; political communication",,,,,,,,,,"Althaus, S.L., Tewksbury, D., Agenda Setting and the 'New' News-Patterns of Issue Importance among Readers of the Paper and Online Versions of the New York Times (2002) Communication Research, 29 (2), pp. 180-207; Bennett, W.L., An Introduction to Journalism Norms and Representations of Politics (1996) Political Communication, 13 (4), pp. 373-384; Bennett, W.L., The Burglar Alarm That Just Keeps Ringing: A Response to Zaller (2003) Political Communication, 20 (2), pp. 131-138; Bennett, W.L., (2003) News: The Politics of Illusion, , 5th Edition, New York: Longman; Bennett, W.L., Lawrence, R.G., Livingston, S., (2007) When the Press Fails: Political Power and the News Media from Iraq to Katrina, , Chicago: University of Chicago Press; Berkowitz, D., Routine Newswork and the What-a-Story: A Case Study of Organizational Adaptation (1992) Journal of Broadcasting and Electronic Media, 36 (1), p. 45; Berkowitz, D., Doing Double Duty: Paradigm Repair and the Princess Diana What-a-Story (2000) Journalism, 1 (2), pp. 125-143; Bird, S.E., (2003) The Audience in Everyday Life: Living in a Media World, , New York: Routledge; Boczkowski, P., News at Work: Imitation in an Age of Information Abundance, , Forthcoming, Chicago: University of Chicago Press; Boczkowski, P., Peer, L., The Choice Gap: The Softening of News and the Divergent Choices of Journalists and Consumers Journal of Communication, , Forthcoming; Bogart, L., (1989) Press and Public, , Hillsdale, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum; Boyle, M.P., Schmierbach, M., Armstrong, C.L., McLeod, D.M., Shah, D.V., Pan, Z.D., Information Seeking and Emotional Reactions to the September 11 Terrorist Attacks (2004) Journalism and Mass Communication Quarterly, 81 (1), pp. 155-167; Buckman, R., Current Status of the Mass Media in Latin America (1996) Communication in Latin America: Journalism, Mass Media, and Society, , In, ed.

It is posited that debate viewing serves as a mediator of this relationship, and age is argued to be a moderator of the association between late-night TV comedy viewing and debate viewing. More specific to age, it is hypothesized that the predictive value of late-night TV comedy for political debate consumption will be greater for those audience members who are younger. A secondary analysis of 2004 national Annenberg debate panel data provides evidence of a positive indirect effect of late-night TV comedy viewing on political talk through debate viewing, and the moderator of age functioned as predicted. Thus, this study details a series of positive unintended consequences of late-night TV comedy viewing on what are defined normatively as positive democratic communicative activities (i.e., debate viewing, political discussion), and these media effects are stronger the younger the voter. © The Author(s) 2010.","debate viewing; entertainment media; late-night TV comedy; political discussion",,,,,,,,,,"Banwart, M.C., McKinney, M.S., Rocking the Youth Vote through Debate: Examining the Effects of a Citizen versus Journalist Controlled Debate on Civic Engagement (2005) Journalism Studies, 6 (2), pp. 153-163; Barker, D.C., (2002) Rushed to Judgment: Talk Radio, Persuasion, and American Political Behavior, , New York: Columbia University Press; Baum, M.A., (2003) Soft News Goes to War, , Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press; Benoit, W.L., Hansen, G.J., Verser, R.M., A Meta-Analysis of the Effects of Viewing U.S. Presidential Debates (2003) Communication Monographs, 70 (4), pp. 335-350; Brians, C.L., Wattenberg, M.P., Campaign Issue Knowledge and Salience: Comparing Reception from TV Commercials, TV News, and Newspapers (1996) American Journal of Political Science, 40, pp. 172-193; Cao, X., Political Comedy Shows and Knowledge about Primary Campaigns: The Moderating Effects of Age and Education (2008) Mass Communication and Society, 11, pp. 43-61; Carlin, D.P., A Rationale for a Focus Group Study (1994) The 1992 Presidential Debates in Focus, pp. 3-19. , In, ed.

They compare paid publicity, election debates, and newspaper coverage for the 2006 Dutch parliamentary elections and conduct an elaborate content analysis. Results show that the level of negative campaigning does not differ greatly across these channels, although election debates clearly show the highest amount of this type of campaigning. Notably, negative campaigning takes a different form in newspaper coverage, where appeals are more personal, focusing on character traits as opposed to being directed to political parties and dealing with political issues. The authors explain those results by pointing to the different levels of control politicians exert over communication channels. They also make a plea to other researchers investigating negative campaigning, asking them to fully consider that their results might be seriously biased by the communication channel they investigate. © The Author(s) 2010.","free publicity; media logic; negative campaigning; political advertising; political communication",,,,,,,,,,"Andeweg, R.B., Irwin, G.A., (2005) Governance and Politics of the Netherlands, , Houndmills, UK: Palgrave Macmillan; Bakker, P., Otto, S., (2007) Communicatiekaart Van Nederland: Overzicht Van Media En Communicatie, , Amsterdam, Netherlands: Kluwer; Benoit, W.L., McHale, J.P., Hansen, G.J., Pier, P.M., McGuire, J.P., (2003) Campaign 2002: A Functional Analysis of Presidential Campaign Discourse, , Lanham: Rowman and Littlefield; Benoit, W.L., (1999) Seeing Spots: A Functional Analysis of Presidential Television Advertisements, 1952-1996, , Westport, CT: Praeger; Brants, K., Sure to Come, but Temporarily Delayed: The Netherlands in Search of the Political Add (2006) The Sage Handbook of Political Advertising, , In, ed.

Past research suggests that attacks on the news media increase perceptions of media bias, but it remains unclear how this occurs. Using two experiments, the author examines how attacks on the news media increase perceptions of bias. For the experiments, all participants read news articles about elected officials, but some read an attack on the source. The author also manipulated the direction of the attack (liberal or conservative bias) and its placement before or after the article. The results suggest that elite attacks increase perceptions of bias in the news source, and this occurs even when the attack is read following the article. In addition, attacks were effective when they came from politicians in both parties, suggesting that Republicans and Democrats are able to influence perceptions of bias. In conclusion, the author argues that elite attacks are likely to benefit the attackers but weaken democratic accountability. © The Author(s) 2010.","Media bias; Party identity; Political perceptions",,,,,,,,,,"Baum, M.A., Tim, G., Shot by the Messenger: Partisan Cues and Public Opinion Regarding National Security and War (2009) Political Behavior, 31, pp. 157-186; Bennett, W.L., (1996) News: The Politics of Illusion, , New York: Longman; Christen, C.T., Prathana, K., Albert, C.G., Hostile Media Perceptions: Partisan Assessments of Press and Public During the 1997 United Parcel Service Strike (2002) Political Communication, 19 (4), pp. 423-436; Dalton, R.J., Paul, A.B., Robert, H., Partisan Cues and the Media: Information Flows in the 1992 Presidential Election (1998) American Political Science Review, 92 (1), pp. 111-126; Darley, J.M., Paget, H.G., A Hypothesis-Confirming Bias in Labeling Effects (1983) Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 44 (1), pp. 20-33; Davies, M.F., Confirmatory Bias in the Evaluation of Personality Descriptions: Positive Test Strategies and Output Interference (2003) Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 85 (4), pp. 736-744; Downs, A., (1957) An Economic Theory of Democracy, , New York: Harper; Eagly, A.H., Wendy, W., Shelly, C., Causal Inferences about Communicators and Their Effect on Opinion Change (1978) Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 36 (4), pp. 424-435; Entman, R.M., How the Media Affect What People Think: An Information Processing Approach (1989) Journal of Politics, 51 (2), pp. 347-370; Gunther, A.C., Biased Press or Biased Public?

But has the increased commercialization in the media market increased or decreased the flow of political information? Hallin and Mancini stress that the existing empirical evidence is fragmented and that this question therefore has been difficult to answer. In this article the authors present new data that allow them to systematically examine how the flow of political information on TV occurs across six Western countries during a thirty-year period. The authors find that the flow of political information through TV varies according to the degree of commercialization. The flow of news and current affairs is lowest in the most commercially oriented television system and among the commercial TV channels. There is however important cross-national variation even within similar media systems. The authors' data do not suggest a convergence toward the liberal system when it comes to the political information environment on TV. Rather, what strikes them is how strongly resistant some European countries have been to subordinating the needs of democracy to profit making. © The Author(s) 2010.","Citizens; Comparative research; Democracy; Television; United States; Western Europe",,,,,,,,,,"Bennet, W.L., (2003) News: The Politics of Illusion, , 5th Edition, New York: Longman; Blekesaune, A., Eiri, E., Toril, A., (2009) Tuning Out the World of News and Current Affairs.

The main purpose is to develop and propose an institutional framework for analyzing how the news media influence participation gaps in different countries. It is argued that past research on media malaise and mobilization effects has not paid attention to the joint influence of two media system characteristics: (1) the strength of media institutions with respect to influencing political participation and (2) the distinctiveness of their population base. European Social Survey data from four democratic corporatist countries are used to analyze both these dimensions of the institutional framework. The results indicate that newspapers and television news might have different influences on participation gaps in these countries, and the findings are discussed in light of the specific media system characteristics of democratic corporatist countries. Finally, some suggestions for future cross-national comparative research based on the proposed institutional framework are discussed. © The Author(s) 2010.","Comparative; Media malaise; Mobilization; Participation; Participation gaps",,,,,,,,,,"Aarts, K., Holli, S., The Divided Electorate: Media Use and Political Involvement (2003) The Journal of Politics, 65 (3), pp. 759-784; Aneshensel, C.S., (2002) Theory-Based Data Analysis for the Social Sciences, , Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage; Badescu, G., Katja, N., Explaining Associational Involvement (2007) Citizenship and Involvement in European Democracies.

The physical attractiveness of Members of the 16th Israeli Knesset (MKs) was assessed by students abroad, who did not know they were evaluating Israeli politicians. The number of times each member appeared on national television news at the time of study was obtained and used as a measure of television news coverage. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that, over and above controls for a host of factors, the physical attractiveness of the MKs was associated with their coverage in television news. © 2010 SAGE Publications.","Journalism; News gathering; Parliament",,,,,,,,,,"Allison, P., (1999) Logistic Regression Using the SAS System, , Cary, NC: SAS Institute; Anderson, C., John, O.P., Keltner, D., Kring, A.M., Who Attains Social Status?

Yet this standard view is incomplete, for it neglects a forgotten but extremely popular worldwide system of visual news reporting based on documentary film shorts. A global system for distributing twice-weekly newsreels was already in place before the First World War, nearly half a century before television news would begin to attract large national audiences and seven decades before CNN would begin distributing news footage once again to all corners of the world. This article aims to reorient political communication scholarship to the historical importance of the newsreel medium and to direct political communication scholars to the rich trove of newsreel film stock that recently became available for analysis. © 2010 SAGE Publications.","Documentary short films; Global news broadcasting; Newsreels; Pretelevision news broadcasts; Soft news",,,,,,,,,,"Althaus, S.L., Free Falls, High Dives, and the Future of Democratic Accountability (2007) The Politics of News: The News of Politics, , In, ed.

Drawing on theories of news production, this study postulates that considerations of news values and the dynamics of resource allocation would combine to shape the quantity of election news. The empirical analysis focuses on a local election in Hong Kong, in which the news media paid different levels of attention to the contests in different constituencies. It shows that characteristics of the electoral contests relevant to the news values of prominence and conflict can explain how much coverage a constituency received, and the influences of news values factors can be interactive as well as additive. At the same time, the influence of resource allocation is illustrated by a relatively stronger media focus on the contests in urban center areas as well as the support for a resource spillover hypothesis.

Undertaken over a twenty-four-month period, with two fieldwork phases, 62 of 121 MPs were interviewed. The broad findings suggest that MPs are relatively sanguine about their media relationships, recognizing their symbiotic nature, but clear differences emerged in terms of the complexity and friendliness of these relationships. Those differences can be accounted for primarily by way of personal style and preferences, on one hand, and party status and position, on the other: factors such as gender (either of the politician or the journalist) were not significant as determinants of difference, although women were more likely to characterize their relationships as ""friendly"" compared with men, who tended to use more neutral language such as ""collegial."". © The Author(s) 2010.","Agenda setting; Journalists; Media relations; New Zealand; Politicians; Press Gallery",,,,,,,,,,"Altheide, D., Robert, S., (1979) Media Logic, , London: Sage; Baistow, T., (1985) Fourth-Rate Estate: An Anatomy of Fleet Street, , London: Comedia; Bennett, W.L., (2003) News: The Politics of Illusion, , New York: Longman; Brown, C., Tories Complain over Paxman Interview (2004) The Independent, , November 26; Clayman, S., John, H., (2002) The News Interview: Journalists and Public Figures on the Air, , Cambridge: Cambridge University Press; Cockerill, M., Lifting the Lid off Spin (2000) British Journalism Review, 11 (2), pp. 6-15; Cohen, J., Yariv, T., Tamir, S., The Influence of Presumed Media Influence in Politics: Do Politicians' Perceptions of Media Power Matter?

The more news production strays from the core function of enhancing democracy, the more potential consumers learn they have little reason to invest their free time consuming serious political journalism. So they don't, and newspapers and the stock market continue redirecting their resources. To counter this, industry observers have been urging non-profit business models. Yet even in this scenario, maintaining their watchdog function requires newspapers to support staffs large enough to investigate the powerful. Therefore, this essay argues, even a non-profit newspaper industry should still pursue mass audiences. Building on a synthesis of scholarly findings, this article suggests ways of doing political journalism that respond to changing audience interests and ever-growing alternatives to traditional daily newspapers-while remaining true to the higher ideals of watchdog journalism.

Administration officials, other journalists, and even his own paper challenged his reporting. Deemed unpatriotic, Salisbury was denied a Pulitzer Prize. This case study employs documents from the files of the New York Times, the CIA, and the Harrison Salisbury Papers at Columbia University, as well as content analysis of his coverage of Vietnam compared with other reporting by him that won a Pulitzer. The study shows how editorial standards of news sourcing become higher when correspondents challenge the official line. While illustrating factors that lead newspapers and reporters to index foreign news to the prevailing political consensus, it also demonstrates the limits of indexing and the conditions under which journalists may effectively challenge the official line. © 2010 SAGE Publications.","Credibility; Foreign correspondence; Harrison Salisbury; Indexing; Sourcing; The New York Times; Vietnam War",,,,,,,,,,"Althaus, S.L., When news norms collide, follow the lead: New evidence for press independence (2003) Political Communication, 20 (4), pp. 381-414; Althaus, S.L., Oats-Sargent, J., (2007) Influencing Agendas: Untangling the Reciprocal Effects of Polling Data and News Coverage on the Topics of Public Discourse, , Paper presented at the 2007 meeting of the Midwest Political Science Association, April 3; Aronson, J., (1990) The Press and the Cold War, , New York: Monthly Review Press; Bennett, W.L., Toward a theory of press-state relations (1990) Journal of Communication, 40 (2), pp. 103-125; Bennett, W.L., Lawrence, R.G., Livingston, S., (2007) When the Press Fails: Political Power and the News Media from Iraq to Katrina, , Chicago: University of Chicago Press; Bennett, W.L., Livingston, S., A semi-independent press: Government control and journalistic autonomy in the political construction of news (2003) Political Communication, 20, pp. 359-362; Borjesson, K., (2005) Feet to the Fire, , Amherst, NY: Prometheus Books; Boylan, J., A Salisbury chronicle (1967) Columbia Journalism Review, (Winter), pp. 10-14; Catledge, T., (1971) My Life and the Times, , New York: Harper & Row; Diamond, E., (1995) Behind the Times: Inside the New New York Times, , Chicago: University of Chicago Press; Domke, D., (2004) God Willing?

Criticism is operationalized in terms of discrete critical statements directed at governmental, political party, business, civil society, and foreign/ international organizations or officials; such critical statements, which take various forms-administrative, character, truth, ideology, policy, and strategy-offer a more comprehensive measure of criticism on a day-to-day basis than the occasional in-depth investigative report. While state intervention is often argued to have a censoring effect, this study finds that the more ""statist"" French press presents a greater density of criticisms than the U.S. press. French newspapers that receive the highest direct subsidies are not less critical of the government or dominant party than other French (or U.S.) newspapers. French newspapers exhibit a slightly higher degree of political parallelism, but in both countries newspapers tend to aim the greatest amount of criticism toward the party in power, whether Left or Right. Relatively higher French criticism is also facilitated by a distinctive French journalistic cultural form, the ""debate ensemble,"" that, in contrast to U.S. ""dramatic narrative,"" organizes the news as a clash of critical opposing viewpoints. © 2010 SAGE Publications.","Comparative research; Democracy; Journalism; Newspapers; North America; Western Europe",,,,,,,,,,"Adams, P.C., (2007) Atlantic Reverberations: French Representations of an American Presidential Election, , Aldershot, UK: Ashgate; Alexander, J.C., The mass news media in systemic, historical and comparative perspective (1981) Mass Media and Social Change, , In, ed.

In particular, it explores the legacy of the politicization of Blair's private persona, or the Blair effect. Was Blair's era a temporary anomaly, or did it have a transformative effect on the way that parties, politicians, and journalists conceive the role of the personal in public discourse and in the construction of a leader's public persona? This research demonstrates that the degree of politicization of private persona still depends, to an important extent, on the personality of the leader and on the leader's communication strategies, and that it is still possible to have a prime minister such as Gordon Brown, who tries to keep his personal life mostly private. But this is only part of the story. Blair's era altered expectations about the role that the personal plays, and ought to play, in public discourse, and how much significance is given to it as a criterion of leadership evaluation. © 2010 SAGE Publications.","David Cameron; Gordon Brown; Personalization of politics; Politicization of private persona; Tony Blair; United Kingdom",,,,,,,,,,"Adam, S., Maier, M., Personalization of politics-Towards a Future Research Agenda (2008), Presented at the annual conference of the International Association for Media and Communication Research, Stockholm, Sweden; Bean, C., The Electoral Influence of Party Leader Images in Australia and New Zealand (1993) Comparative Political Studies, 26 (1), pp. 111-132; Bean, C., Mughan, A., Leadership Effects in Parliamentary Elections in Australia and Britain (1989) American Political Science Review, 83, pp. 1165-1179; (2008) BBC News, , http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/7295735.stm, Cameron Defends Filming of Family, Mar. 14; (2005) BBC News, , http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/4340328.stm, Cameron Pressed on Drugs Question, Oct. 14; Coleman, S., How the Other Half Votes.

There are even fewer that include both newspapers and TV news and that probe possible antecedents of how the media frame politics in their election news.

The study focuses on the importance of media channels, media types, and commercialism as antecedents of the media's framing of election news. © 2010 SAGE Publications.","Comparative research; Election news; Media framing; Newspapers; Television news",,,,,,,,,,"de Bens, E., Belgium (2003) The Media in Europe, , In, ed.

Scholars know little about the antecedent of this assumed spiral of cynicism: How cynical are politicians and journalists about each other and about politics? Based on a survey among Dutch politicians and political journalists, the research presented in this article tries to fill this gap. The results show that politicians are rather cynical about media and journalists, especially when they feel media are out to set the political agenda. Journalists are equally cynical about politicians as the latter are about themselves, but it is a relative cynicism since it is lower than that of the general public. Journalists are, however, convinced that most politicians are driven by what we call ""media salacity,"" a drive to get journalists' attention and coverage, a conviction shared, surprisingly, by the politicians themselves. © 2010 SAGE Publications.","Political journalism; Politicians' media salacity; Spiral of cynicism hypothesis; Survey; Video malaise theory",,,,,,,,,,"Aarts, K., Semetko, H.A., The Divided Electorate: Media Use and Political Involvement (2003) Journal of Politics, 65 (3), pp. 759-784; van Aelst, P., Brants, K., van Dalen, A., van Praag, P., de Vreese, C., Nuytemans, M., The Fourth Estate as Superpower?

As part of a wider study, this research identifies trends in reporting Europe in the United States after 9/11. Following a summary of the current state of research, the study's methodological design is discussed. It is based on a sample of 27 qualitative semistructured in-depth interviews with foreign correspondents working for different U.S. media outlets in Europe. The interviewed correspondents describe that since 9/11, U.S. public interest in 9/11-related foreign affairs has increased while general U.S. foreign news coverage has decreased further. With the geographic news focus shifted toward the Middle East, Europe-based U.S. foreign correspondents increasingly report about Muslim communities in Europe.

In particular, it examines the relationships among media coverage of local newspapers, state-level public opinion, and state legislative policies. In addition, it tests two state-level intervening factors: state legislative professionalism and state political culture. This study includes a geographic scope of eighteen U.S. states and a time period of twenty-two years from 1984 to 2006. The media agenda is represented by the news coverage of a state's most popular newspaper. The public agenda employs a survey question asking, ""What is the most important issue facing the state?"" The policy agenda is defined by the number of bills that are introduced in the state house. This study finds a moderate and positive relationship between the newspaper agenda and the public agenda in five U.S. states from 1984 to 1997, a strong positive relationship between the newspaper agenda and the policy agenda in fifteen U.S. states from 1989 to 2006, and a weak positive relationship between the public agenda and the policy agenda in South Carolina in 1989 and 1990. State political culture moderates the degree of agenda-setting effects between the newspaper coverage and the legislative policies. © 2009 Sage Publications.","Agenda setting; Local news; Policy making; Public opinion",,,,,,,,,,"Baumgartner, F.R., Jones, B.D., Agenda Dynamics and Policy Subsystems (1991) Journal of Politics, 53 (4), pp. 1044-74; Baumgartner, F.R., Jones, B.D., (1993) Agendas and Instability in American Politics, , Chicago: University of Chicago Press; Cobb, R.W., Elder, C.D., (1972) Participation in American Politics: The Dynamics of Agenda-Setting, , Boston: Allyn & Bacon; Cohen, B., (1963) The Press and Foreign Policy, , Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press; Cohen, J.E., Introduction: Studying Public Opinion in the American States (2006) Public Opinion in State Politics, , In, ed.

The current study departs from most research in this area by focusing on how both news source and individual characteristics of news consumers moderate the influence of news exposure on political trust. Employing several panel studies from a survey specifically designed to investigate media use and campaign dynamics during the 2000 presidential election, the current study makes several novel contributions to the literature. Specifically, the author finds that the influence of news media on political trust-positive or negative-is dependent on both the news source (i.e., newspaper or television) and individuals' existing level of political trust. Those with low levels of political trust do not become more or less trusting following news exposure regardless of the news source. However, those with higher levels of political trust become more trusting following exposure to newspapers and less trusting following exposure to television news. © 2009 Sage Publications.","Media effects; News media; Political trust; Public opinion",,,,,,,,,,"Aarts, K., Semetko, A.H., The Divided Electorate: Media Use and Political Involvement (2003) Journal of Politics, 65, pp. 759-84; Allison, P.D., Change Scores and Dependent Variables in Regression Analysis (1990) Sociological Methodology, 20, pp. 93-114; Allsop, D., Weisberg, H., Measuring Change in Party Identification in an Election 'Campaign (1988) American Journal of Political Science, 32, pp. 996-1017; Arceneaux, K., Johnson, M., The Tone of Televised Political Discussion: Norming Studies for Communication Research (2008), Presented at the 2008 meeting of the American Political Science Association, Boston; Brians, C.L., Wattenberg, M.P., Campaign Issue Knowledge and Salience: Comparing Reception from TV Commercials, TV News and Newspapers (1996) American Journal of Political Science, 40, pp. 172-93; Cappella, J., Kathleen, N., Jamieson, H., (1997) Spiral of Cynicism, , New York: Oxford University Press; Citrin, J., Comment: The Political Relevance of Trust in Government (1974) American Political Science Review, 68, pp. 973-88; Citrin, J., Samantha, L., Political Trust Revisited: Déjà Vu All over Again?

They even held high-ranking positions. Newspaper owners were aware of their political orientations, but they did not seem concerned. In fact, some of those communist journalists enjoyed high professional prestige. An unusual symbiotic relationship has developed between conservative publishers and their communist employees. This article discusses such relationship in light of the modernization of Brazilian newspapers that started in the 1950s. To modernize their newspapers, publishers needed to rely on journalists' ability to deal with the news as a technical, industrial product. Journalists with communist sympathies provided skilled work and were willing to be loyal and disciplined in the newsrooms. They had their own reasons for working in the ""big press."" The American rhetoric of professional journalism provided a common language for communist journalists and conservative publishers to work together. The Brazilian case has important lessons for analyzing the adaptation of the American model of professional journalism in different national settings. © 2009 SAGE Publications.","Americanization; Brazil; Communism; Journalism",,,,,,,,,,"Abramo, C., (1993) A Regra Do Jogo, , São Paulo: Companhia das Letras; Abramo, P., (1997) Um Trabalhador Da NotíCia.

In the context of Brazil's recent democratization process, the author analyzes mediated deliberation in the national referendum for banning firearm and ammunition sales in 2005. The following indicators are explored: (1) participant accessibility and characterization, (2) use of arguments, (3) reciprocity and responsiveness, and (4) reflexivity and reversibility of opinions. The article argues that normative deliberation principles add to controversy frame studies by helping understand how contending interlocutors increase the quality and the complexity of reasons in dispute in situations where no consensus or general agreement is expected. © 2009 SAGE Publications.","Deliberative democracy; Latin America; News coverage; Public sphere",,,,,,,,,,"Fátima, A., Inácio, M., Novais, R., Referendo e democracia: Perdas e ganhos (2006) Democracia E Referendo No Brasil, , In, ed.

Adding to the work of Enrique Peruzzotti and Catalina Smulovitz, the article argues that the media act as a mechanism of social accountability by providing a forum for debate for a plurality of actors to establish who should be held accountable, what they should be held accountable for, and how they should be held accountable. An analysis of this role of the media is applied to the newspaper coverage of an incident of police violence against social protest in Argentina. The debate in this case contributes to the reframing of excessive police violence against social protest in Argentina as unacceptable, thus acting as a form of preventive accountability. © 2009 SAGE Publications.","Argentina; Media; Police; Protests; Social accountability",,,,,,,,,,"Andersen, M., (2002) La Policía: Pasado, Presente Y Propuestas Para El Futuro, , Buenos Aires: Editorial Sudamericana; Behrend, J., Mobilization and Accountability: A Study of Social Control in the 'Cabezas' Case in Argentina (2006) Enforcing the Rule of Law: Social Accountability in the New Latin American Democracies, , In, ed.

The authors found that participants in their longitudinal, qualitative study expressed extreme dissatisfaction with politics, politicians, and the outcomes of a young democracy yet voiced enthusiasm for voting. Checks after the ballot revealed they actually did vote. In this article, the authors argue that this unlikely constellation is explained by participants' emotional appraisals of mediated campaign messages about a polarizing presidential candidate. Grounded in an individual's class position, emotional appraisal of this candidate generated fear in wealthy participants and hope in poorer participants. The coping mechanism, or ""secondary assessment"" of the candidate, was the firm decision to vote. Based on these findings, the authors propose a model of disenchanted voting that integrates research on emotional appraisal and the social construction of emotions with election salience and personal political efficacy. These findings may be of use in economically polarized democracies beyond Mexico. However, the authors question whether long-term polarizing political discourse is a viable antidote to disenchantment with the uneven economic and social justice outcomes of Latin American democracy. © 2009 SAGE Publications.","Emotional appraisal; Emotions and voting; Mediated campaigning; Mexico; Voter turnout",,,,,,,,,,"Barbalet, J.M., (1998) Emotion, Social Theory & Social Structure: A Macrostructural Approach, , New York: Cambridge University Press; Coneval, (2007) Mapas De Pobreza En México, México, , Mexico City: Consejo Nacional de Evaluación de la Política Social; Corbacho, A., Schwartz, G., (2002) Mexico: Experiences with Pro-Poor Expenditure Policies.

Such arrangements are frequently managed and negotiated through politically engaged institutions. The resulting video is transmitted and traded with the underlying assumption that images are discrete, objective representations of real events, an assumption that is called into question when the practice is carefully examined. Unlike facts or ideas, which are intangible and constructed entirely in language, video images are constructed both discursively and materially. Consequently the power to grant physical access to events for photographic coverage grants political actors an advantage as they negotiate their image, literally and metaphorically. This qualitative study describes several such feeds and politically regulated video subsidies, their use by news organizations, and the means by which political agents influence their own image through such feeds. Data in the form of extended interviews and field observations were collected between 2005 and 2007 in the United States and Britain. Site visits include Congress, a U.S. statehouse, a state cable operation, and British Parliament. The findings indicate that journalism's relay of video images as objective, factual material, rather than constructions negotiated with political actors, fosters an illusion of transparency. © 2009 SAGE Publications.","Broadcasting; Congress; Parliament; Photographic practice; Photojournalism; Political communication; Television news; Video",,,,,,,,,,"David, A., The format of TV network news (1987) The Focused Screen, , Jose Vidal-Beneyto and Peter Dahlgren.

The Politicsĝ€"" Mediaĝ€""Politics principle argues that cross-national differences in the role of the news media in most political processes can be best understood by examining how variations in political environments affect media performance, which in turn leads to different types of effects on politics. Based on this principle, it is argued that the news media operating in polarized multiparty democracies will allow greater access to oppositional voices than those in two-party democracies. This thesis is examined by comparing the news coverage of major news stories in the United States and Israel in 1984, 1990, and 2000. These two countries provide a useful comparison because they have similar media systems but polar opposite political systems.

But how do local broadcasters determine the composition of their local community? And is their portrayal of the community consistent with the ideals of representative democracy? Through one of the first systematic examinations of Spanish- and English-language local television newscasts, the authors find that general market media attention to Latino audiences is a function of the characteristics of the target audience, the size of the media market, the interaction of market size and market characteristics, and the degree of competition between local stations. The results, however, also indicate that even under the most optimal circumstances, general market outlets provide minimal coverage of minority interests. The implications for localism in broadcasting, democratic representation, and the nature and quality of political information reaching citizens and noncitizens alike are also discussed. © 2009 SAGE Publications.","Local television news; Mass media; Minority media; Political news coverage",,,,,,,,,,"Laurien, A., Henrik, Rehbinder., Separate but Equal: Comparing Local News in English and Spanish (2002) Project for Excellence in Journalism, , http://www.journalism.org/node/230; Barreto Matt, A., Muñoz., J.A., ""reexamining the 'Politics of In-between': Political Participation among Mexican Immigrants in the United States.""

Our analyses suggest that attitudes toward gay marriage were largely shaped by ideological orientations and religious predispositions during the course of the 2004 election cycle. We show that ideological predispositions acted as perceptual filters by moderating the influence that attention to television campaign coverage has on shaping support for gay marriage. Our findings also suggest that ideological and religious predispositions attenuated the effects of political knowledge and judgments of political tolerance on influencing support for gay marriage.

However, the understanding of the prevalence of different news frames in the media coverage of politics is limited in several respects. This article seeks to contribute to remedying this by (1) conducting a longitudinal analysis of the use of different news frames during election periods as well as in everyday politics, (2) adopting an analytical framework including several different types of process focus, and (3) pointing to the importance of including political developments alongside changes in the media system when explaining developments in the news coverage of politics. The empirical analysis of twenty years of public radio news in Denmark confirms a long-term trend toward greater focus on electoral consequences in news stories in election periods; however, the trend is not mirrored in news stories when an election is not imminent. In explaining these findings, situational factors related to the political system and party politics must be included alongside explanations pointing toward an increasing professionalization of political parties as well as long-term changes in the media system and in party competition. © 2009 SAGE Publications.","Election campaign; Media framing; Political parties; Tabloidization; Western Europe",,,,,,,,,,"Benoit William, L., Stein, K.A., Hansen., G.J., New York Times Coverage of Presidential Campaigns (2005) Journalism & Mass Communication Quarterly, 82 (2), pp. 356-76; Lars, B., Karina, Pedersen., Electoral fortunes and responses of the social democratic party and liberal party in Denmark (2004) Political Parties and Electoral Change, , Peter Mair, Wolfgang C.

Results indicate that political ideology influences biased processing of ambiguous political messages and source in late-night comedy. Using data from an experiment (N = 332), we found that individual-level political ideology significantly predicted perceptions of Colbert's political ideology. Additionally, there was no significant difference between the groups in thinking Colbert was funny, but conservatives were more likely to report that Colbert only pretends to be joking and genuinely meant what he said while liberals were more likely to report that Colbert used satire and was not serious when offering political statements. Conservatism also significantly predicted perceptions that Colbert disliked liberalism. Finally, a post hoc analysis revealed that perceptions of Colbert's political opinions fully mediated the relationship between political ideology and individual-level opinion. © 2009 SAGE Publications.","Comedy; Information processing; Political entertainment; Political ideology; Satire",,,,,,,,,,"Balcetis, E., Dunning, D., See What You Want to See: Motivational Influences on Visual Perception (2006) Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 91 (4), pp. 612-25; Geoffrey, B., The Daily Show: Discursive Integration and the Reinvention of Political Journalism (2005) Political Communication, 22 (3), pp. 259-76; Paul Allen, B., (1992) Party Politics in America, , New York : Harper Collins; Bem Daryl, J., Self-perception theory (1972) Advances in Experimental Social Psychology, , L.

Fifteen years earlier, in the 1st Intifada, Palestinians were altogether excluded from the screen. This time round, in spite of the higher level of violence, the Israeli public was exposed to their human side-as political leaders, victims, witnesses, and even terrorists. The authors' analysis of news photos and television representations (2000-2005) reveals that during the 2nd Intifada coverage was expanded to include a broad range of Palestinian figures. Alongside traditional framing, Palestinians are also seen as ordinary people living under occupation, often as direct victims of the Israeli military. Analysis of the relationship among these images (including their textual framing), with their implied readers and with ""real"" readers with ideological preconceptions, leads to arguing that the emotional appeal of the varied representation calls into question the understanding of the conflict as a fixated black-and-white dichotomy. The authors suggest reasons for this new media openness. In conclusion, the authors point to the ways in which their model can facilitate an understanding of images of the ""other"" side in armed conflicts. © 2009 Sage Publications.","Broadcasting news; Journalism; Middle East; Political conflict; Terrorism; War coverage",,,,,,,,,,"Barthes, R., (1977) Image-Music-Text, , New York: Hill and Wang; Barthes, R., (1981) Camera Lucida, , New York: Hill and Wang; (1993) Framing the Intifada: Media and People, , Cohen, A.

In his successful race against billionaire candidate Alvaro Noboa, Rafael Correa crafted a hybrid campaign in a double sense. First, he blended the country's classic populist discourse with forward-looking appeals for change. Second, Correa's organization deftly combined state-of-the-art publicity and the application of new information technology with traditional grassroots organizing and the spectacle of rallies. Ecuador's presidential election illustrates the extent to which Latin America has advanced along Pippa Norris's historical continuum of campaign practices. It also provides further evidence of the tenacious appeal of populism in Latin America and how modern and postmodern forms of campaigning can be brought to bear in reproducing populist-style politicking and a hybrid political culture. © 2009 SAGE Publications.","Campaign; Hybridity; Hybridization; Modernity; Populism; Presidential election",,,,,,,,,,"Angell, A., Kinzo, M.D., Urbaneja, D., Latin America (1992) Electioneering: A Comparative Study of Continuity and Change, , In, ed.

Positive news framing in a referendum campaign can generate a perception of risk among those voters opposing the proposal and stimulate electoral participation to prevent an undesired outcome that would alter a status quo situation. To test this claim, the authors analyze the effect of news framing on turnout in the context of the 2005 Dutch EU Constitution referendum campaign and combine a media content analysis of national newspapers and television news (n = 6,370) with panel survey data (n = 642) and an experiment (n = 687). Experimental findings show that individuals who are skeptical toward the EU and are subsequently exposed to positive news framing about the EU Constitution are mobilized to turn out and vote against it. The results of the content analysis show that during the Dutch referendum campaign, news media framed the EU Constitution in positive terms. Building these findings into a measure of news exposure in our panel survey, the authors find that higher exposure to referendum news had a mobilizing effect on those opposing the proposal. The experimental and panel data thus show corroborating evidence supporting the central hypothesis about how positive news can mobilize the skeptics to turn out and vote in a referendum. © 2009 Sage Publications.","Mobilization; News framing; Prospect theory; Referendum campaign; Turnout",,,,,,,,,,"Aarts, K., Der H.Van, ""understanding the Dutch 'No': The Euro, the East and the Elite.""

The first section gives an overview of the emergence of expertise in government and the rise of think tanks, locating this within a wider sociology of the intellectuals. It discusses the development of New Labour expertise in response to that of Thatcherite Conservatism in the battle to dominate public policy agendas. The second section illustrates the growth of the New Labour gpolicy generationg and the emergence of a cohort of experts in the fields of media, communications, and culture and discusses routes taken by them into government. The final section, based on interviews, discusses the power plays behind New Labour policy making in the creative industries field. It considers the impact of ministerial changes on the policy process, illustrates how interdepartmental rivalries introduce complexity and demonstrates how civil service expertise may be mobilised to neutralise that of outside experts. The conclusion addresses the implications of this analysis. © 2009 Sage Publications.","Creative economy; Creative industries; Expertise; Government; Intellectuals; Public policy; Think tanks; United Kingdom",,,,,,,,,,"Tim, B., ""demos: Populism, Eclecticism and Equidistance in the Post-Modern World.""

Original archival material shows how these seminars in several ways facilitated the spread of campaign techniques originating in the United States: (1) through the collective discussion and adaptation of U.S. innovations to a European context and (2) as a catalyst for bilateral relationships between otherwise unlikely partners. Members from small countries gained access to global leaders of campaign development in the shape of operatives from the U.K. Conservative Party, the German CDU, and the U.S. Republican Party. The campaign seminar group depended on the will of EDU members from these powerful countries to build and maintain a transnational organization within the frameworks of the cold war and European integration. In conclusion, the article argues that mediating instances such as the campaign seminars should be integrated in explanatory concepts such as gmodernizationg and gAmericanization,g as should historical context. © 2009 Sage Publications.","Election campaign; Globalization; New technologies; Political parties; United States; Western Europe",,,,,,,,,,"Kent, A., (1986) MaCurrency Signktiga Massmedier: Studier i Politisk Opinionsbildning, , Stockholm: Fa¶rlaget Akademilitteratur; Blumler Jay, G., Kavanagh, D., Nossiter, T.J., Modern Communications versus Traditional Politics in Britain: Unstable Marriage of Convenience.""

It takes an ethnographic approach and analyzes how journalists at Malaysiakini conceive of gindependent journalismg and how this understanding is related to broader questions of democracy and social change. Malaysian journalists are not only restricted by the law but also by structures of ownership in which mainstream news organizations are linked to the ruling Barisan Nasional coalition. Like Malaysia's proliferating blogging community, Malaysiakini has taken advantage of an unlikely loophole in the law that promises a gno-censorshipg policy for the Internet. Yet unlike Malaysia's bloggers, Malaysiakini functions as a traditional news provider, and it is the norms and values of journalistic professionalism rather than the medium of the Internet that make Malaysiakini so threatening to government authorities. The author argues that Malaysiakini uses the norms of good journalism to legitimize alternative views of events, thus challenging the authoritarianism of the Barisan Nasional. She concludes by suggesting that in creating a space where citizens are free to express their opinions, Malaysiakini deliberately promotes a blueprint for democratic civic discourse in Malaysia. © 2009 Sage Publications.","Authoritarianism; Freedom of the press; Internet; Journalism; Journalistic norms; Southeast Asia",,,,,,,,,,"Graham, B., ""the Rough and Rosy Road: Sites of Contestation in Malaysia's Shackled Media Industry.""

This article examines the determinants of Swiss legislators' presence and prominence in the print media by focusing on three competing approaches drawn from communication studies. The first approach regards the media as a gmirrorg of political reality and argues that the media focus on the most active deputies in parliament. Second, news values theory predicts that gauthoritativeg politicians in leadership positions get the most media coverage. Third, theories of gnews biasg hold that the media privilege legislators who are in line with their own editorial interests. Overall, the statistical analyses show an important leadership effect and provide strong support for the second explanation. While deputies in official functions get the most extensive news coverage, media access can also be won by parliamentary activity. The least support is shown for the news bias theory, although some newspapers try to localize parliamentary news coverage by focusing on deputies from their own media market. © 2009 Sage Publications.","Content analysis; News coverage; Parliament; Print media; Selection logic; Switzerland",,,,,,,,,,"Altheide David, L., Snow, R.P., (1979) Media Logic, , Beverly Hills, CA: Sage; Roger, B., Parlament und Massenmedien.""

While self-censorship constitutes a major threat to press freedom in Hong Kong under China, recent studies have shown that Hong Kong journalists have maintained a strong sense of professionalism. The coexistence of professionalism and self-censorship poses important challenges to news organizations: How is self-censorship effected as professionalism does not favor its practice? How can news organizations minimize the conflicts between self-censorship and professionalism so that news operations will remain stable, smooth, and efficient? Drawing on the literature on newsroom social control, we tackle the above questions by focusing on the internal structure of and the interactive dynamics within newsrooms. Methodologically, this study draws on both representative survey and in-depth interview data. It is found that self-censorship is effected through selective positioning and assignment, observational learning of tacit rules, the giving of ambiguous orders, and the use of professional or technical reasons to justify questionable news decisions. Meanwhile, some journalists also developed their own operational tactics to resist what they perceived as self-censorship attempts. The theoretical implications of the findings are discussed. © 2009 Sage Publications.","Newsroom social control; Newsroom structure; Professionalism; Self-censorship",,,,,,,,,,"Ben, B., (2000) The Media Monopoly, , 6th ed.

Four questions were posed: (1) Is there a general tendency for evaluations of candidates to improve or deteriorate after a debate? (2) Do evaluations of one candidate negatively correlate with changes in evaluations of opponents? (3) Do debates disadvantage incumbents? (4) Do debates advantage less popular candidates? Using ""feeling thermometer"" items to measure voter evaluations, four patterns are revealed. First, candidates generally gain points.The supposed mudslinging that characterizes a debate appears not to feed into any notion of cynicism. Instead, voters appear to gain an appreciation for the debaters. Second, a candidate's gain is not earned at the expense of those deemed to have ""lost"" the match. Third, a debate does not disadvantage an incumbent. A candidate with a record to defend stands about as much chance of benefiting from a debate as a challenger.And fourth, any evaluation gaps before a debate become narrower following a debate. This final effect, which is particularly true of American presidential debates, may reflect a debate's ability to raise awareness of less popular candidates. © 2008 Sage Publications.","Debate effects; Feeling thermometers; Voting behavior",,,,,,,,,,"Abramowitz Alan, I., ""an Improved Model for Predicting Presidential Election Outcomes.""

The article also provides a critical review of recent studies on Arab journalists, showing their shortcomings and their tendency to sidestep the analysis of power distribution among journalists. It provides examples of the themes that may guide this new research confining the discussion to pan-Arab media, particularly news satellite channels. It argues for seeing Arab journalists as an interpretive community, examining the way these journalists perceive their ""professional identity"" and how they define the power they share in their community of practitioners. © 2008 Sage Publications.","Arab journalists; Bourdieu; Cultural intermediaries; Interpretive community; Pan-Arab media",,,,,,,,,,"Nabi, A., Fattah, A., (1989) Sociology of News [In Arabic], , Cairo : Al Arabi Books; Rasheed Anas, A., (1998) Professional Values.

This study uses data from an experiment to examine the impact of news about her endorsement. Exposure to such news did not influence the extent to which participants held favorable opinions toward Obama or the extent to which they saw him as likable. On the other hand, reading about the endorsement did lead participants to see Obama as more likely to win the nomination and to say that they would be more likely to vote for him.

The contradictions surrounding the use of ""Comrade"" in national media are indicative of ZANU PF's radical agenda, which remains unfulfilled decades after independence. The second part illustrates the ways in which ZANU's Marxist-inspired media policies have resulted in a narrowly defined national news space. Looking ahead, the post-August 2008 political arrangement offers a good opportunity to genuinely democratize the country's media. © 2008 Sage Publications.","African politics; Comrade; Mugabe; News; ZANU; Zimbabwe television",,,,,,,,,,"Broadcasting Corporation, B., BBC Report by the Study Group on the Future of Broadcasting in Zimbabwe (1980) Harare; Andersen, B., Television, Political Culture and the Identity of Citizenship Unpublished Paper Presented to A Conference on Identities, Democracy, Culture and Communication in Southern Africa; Gazette, D., (1994) No TV Cameras, No Speech; Dashwood Hevina, S., The Relevance of Class to the Evolution of Zimbabwe's Development Strategy, 1980-1991 (1996) Journal of Southern African Studies, 22 (1), pp. 27-48; Weizman, H., Zimbabwe on the Brink, Mugabe's 'Marxism,' Zimbabwe's Red 1990s:The Character of the Opposition (2000) Socialism Today, 47. , http://www.socialismtoday.org/47/zimbabwe.html; Johntirivafi, K., Charles, N., (1986) Zimbabwe Broadcasting Corporation:Voice of Zimbabwe"" in Making Broadcasting Useful: The African Experience. the Development of Radio and Television in Africa in the 1980s, , G.

Our assessment of the celebrity advocacy tactics used by fifty-three environmental groups suggests that celebrities instead play a growing role as part of an emerging strategy for political advocacy. Spawned by the difficulty most groups have making news, and made possible by the evolution of technology and the public sphere, this new celebrity advocacy strategy represents one aspect of a broader shift in American politics being ushered in by the digital age. © 2008 Sage Publications.","Advocacy; Interest groups; Internet; New technologies; Public sphere; Social movements",,,,,,,,,,"Matthew, B., (2003) Soft News Goes ToWar, , Princeton, NJ : Princeton University Press; Baumgartner Frank, R., Jones., B.D., (1993) Agendas and Instability in American Politics, , Chicago: University of Chicago Press; Bruce, B., (2003) Information and American Democracy, , Cambridge: Cambridge University Press; Broder John, M., Create-an-Ad Contest Aims to Push Climate Message (2007) NewYork Times, p. 5; Mollyann, B., Hamel, E., Ann Brady, L., Kates, J., Altman., D.E., AIDS at 21: Media Coverage of the HIV Epidemic 1981-2002 (2004) Columbia Journalism Review, pp. 1-A6; Ronald, B., (1990) The Power and the Glitter:the Hollywood-Washington Connection, , New York: Pantheon; Helena, C., Darfur Collides with Olympics, and China Yields (2007) New York Times, 13, p. 13; Danelian Lucig, H., Page., B.I., The Heavenly Chorus: Interest Group Voices on TV News (1994) American Journal of Political Science, 38 (10), pp. 1056-78; Entman Robert, M., (2003) Projections of Power, , Chicago: University of Chicago Press; Anne Taylor, F., Turning Stars into Environmentalists (1989) New York Times, p. 8; Donna, F., Celebrity Activists Put Star Power to Good Use (2006) USA Today, p. 23; Joshua, G., (1994) Claims to Fame: Celebrity in Contemporary America, , Berkeley: University of California Press; Gans Herbert, J., (1980) DecidingWhat's News, , New York: Vintage; Todd, G., (1980) TheWholeWorld IsWatching: Mass Media in the Making and Unmaking of the New Left, , Berkeley: University of California Press; Jurgen, H., (1992) The Structural Transformation of the Public Sphere, , New York: Polity; Hallin Daniel, C., Mancini, P., (2004) Comparing Media Systems, , NewYork: Cambridge University Press; John, H., The Cause That Lost Its Cachet (2006) The Independent (London), p. 32; Jackson David, J., Darrow, A.T.I., The Influence of Celebrity Endorsements on Young Adults' Political Opinions (2005) Harvard International Journal of Press/Politics, 10 (3), pp. 80-98; Samuel, K., Baum., M.A., Has Cable Ended the Golden Age of Television?

What is worse, from Kazakhstan to Uzbekistan, prospects for developing a believable, fact-based journalism look grim. Much of this trouble can be laid at the doorstep of self-censorship, which flourishes across the region with uncommon vigor. Central Asian journalism is in worse shape than the rest of the post-Communist world, largely because the socioeconomic and political situations in this relatively remote region remain in flux from a backwardness that modernity is only of late and slowly affecting. One of the most confounding elements that stymie the evolution of Central Asia journalism is a culture that drives the new post-Communist institutions and the mentalities of the region's sociopolitical, economic, and cultural elites. Consequently, those who endeavor to aid the evolution of Central Asian media should look to the history and culture of the region and then impart a more complete understanding of Western journalism's mission, values, roles, and sound news business practices before addressing journalistic techniques. © 2008 Sage Publications.","Authoritarianism; Central Asia; Democracy; Freedom of the press",,,,,,,,,,"Jakubowicz, K., (2006) Rude Awakening: Social and Media Changes in Central and Eastern Europe, , Cresskill, NJ: Hampton Press; Gross, P., (2002) Entangled Evolutions: Media and Democratization in Eastern Europe, , (Baltimore, MD and Washington, D.C.: The Johns Hopkins University Press / Woodrow Wilson Center Press); Research, I., Board, E., Media Sustainability Index-Europe and Eurasia 2008, , http://www.irex.org/programs/MSI_EUR/2008/exec.asp; Babakhanov, U., (2007) Interview by Gross, , Dec. 8 Dushanbe,Tajikistan; Sattorov, A., (2007) Interview by Gross, , Dec. 7 Dushanbe, Tajikistan; Society Justice Initiative, O., (2005) The Growing Threat of Soft Censorship: A Paper on Indirect Restrictions on Freedom of Expression Worldwide, , http://www.justiceinitiative.org/db/resource2/fs/?file_id=16599; http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d05803.pdf; Myers, M., Media and Information Accountability: What Are Other Donors Doing, What Works, What Are the Gaps?

It goes beyond traditional sound bite research by extending the scope of analysis also to visuals and by analyzing both sound and image bites not only with regard to their length but also with regard to their content and editorial packaging. Based on these findings, contours of three different political news cultures emerge: a strongly interventionist U.S. American approach, a moderately interventionist Anglo-German approach, and a noninterventionist French approach. Adopting an explicitly cross-national comparative perspective, the study introduces a theoretical model that explains sound bite news in divergent media systems and links it to the concept of media culture. It derives seven hypotheses from the model and tests them on three levels of analysis-organizational, national, and transnational. Despite a growing transnational convergence, multivariate data analysis shows evidence of the enduring importance that national parameters continue to exert.

In addition, the authors found positive interactions between political knowledge and strategic press and publicity news exposure, showing that more knowledgeable individuals were more strongly affected by these frames.

However, both these concepts are used more often than they are properly defined. Moreover, there is a lack of analysis of the process of mediatization, although the concept as such denotes a process.Thus the purpose of this article is to analyze the concepts of mediated and mediatized politics from a process-oriented perspective. The article argues that mediatization is a multidimensional and inherently process-oriented concept and that it is possible to make a distinction between four phases of mediatization. Each of these phases is analyzed. The conclusion is that as politics becomes increasingly mediatized, the important question no longer is related to the independence of the media from politics and society. The important question becomes the independence of politics and society from the media. © 2008 Sage Publications.","Media logic; Mediated politics; Mediatization; Political logic; Press politics",,,,,,,,,,"Altheide David, L., Snow, R.P., (1979) Media Logic, , Beverly Hills, CA: Sage; Altheide David, L., Snow, R.P., Toward a theory of mediation (1988) Communication Yearbook, , James A.

To date, most scholarly studies of the phenomenon have focused on its features and consequences in advanced democracies. This study expands the analysis of the permanent campaign by examining its relationship to the rise of an extreme version of the plebiscitary presidency in the Andean region of Latin America. Through an examination of the administration of Rafael Correa in Ecuador, we show how the permanent campaign has been used as part of a strategy to secure the president's stay in office and effect far-reaching constitutional change. In countries where mechanisms of accountability are already weak, we conclude that conjoining of the plebiscitary presidency and the permanent campaign is likely to exacerbate the accountability deficit and generate problematic consequences for democratic political development. © 2008 Sage Publications.","Democracy; Ecuador; Permanent campaign; Plebiscitary presidency; Presidential communication",,,,,,,,,,"Sidney, B., (1982) The Permanent Campaign, , New York: Simon and Schuster; Jorge, C., Latin America's Left Turn (2006) Foreign Affairs, 85 (3), pp. 28-42; Corey, C., The Permanence of the 'Permanent Campaign': George W.

Five media hypes on the same subject area (the care for and spending on the elderly) are analyzed.Their immediate influence on policy making is traced, and although the media often is assumed to exercise real political power through media hypes, no-or only few-traces of such direct political influence is found. Instead media hypes are used strategically by politicians to forward their ongoing work and their positions in the public debate, thus if the media gains political influence because of media hypes one can only see this influence as diffuse and not directly linked to the media hypes themselves. © 2008 Sage Publications.","Media hype; Media power; News making; Policy making; Welfare policy",,,,,,,,,,"Altheide David, L., Snow, R.P., (1979) Media Logic, , Beverly Hills: Sage Publications; Stephen, A., Behr, R., Iyengar, S., Mass Media and Elections: An Overview (1991) American Politics Quarterly, 19 (1), pp. 109-39; Peter, B., Baratz, M., Two Faces of Power (1962) American Political Science Review, 56 (4), pp. 947-52; Andrew, B., Process tracing: A Bayesian perspective (Draft, October 2007) Oxford Handbook of Political Methodology, , Janet Box-Steffensmeier, Henry Brady, and David Collier.

Candidate debates returned to Spanish television after fifteen years, but the moderating role of journalists was banned by the two big parties, who defined and agreed on the debate topics beforehand.The use of new communication technologies by political parties did not result in an open-source campaign.

While increased attention to these issues is imGortant for the symbolic reGresentation of these Golitically marginalized grouGs, women's and minority issues often constitute a minor Gortion of reGresentatives' agendas. Strategically, female, Latino, and African American U.S. House members may Grovide greater symbolic reGresentation for women and minorities by including their interests and concerns in discussion of more general issues that commonly toG the Golitical agenda. Relying on a content analysis of 1R1 official congressional Web sites, the author examines the extent to which reGresentatives address the needs of their female and minority constituents in their general issue discussion. Results demonstrate that female, Latino, and African American House members more freOuently connect general issues to race, ethnicity, and gender comGared with their Anglo and male counterGarts.

This article reviews the implications of this meeting for democracy and the media in light of the history of media-state relations during and after the political transition, and in terms of the unique role of the media in acting as internal opposition to the successive ruling apartheid and post-apartheid governments.The question of rotating elites within the ruling party briefly is examined. Issues of broadcasting and the print media are discussed against then backdrop of South African history. Issues of black economic empowerment and party political economic, and media-state, relations are examined. Also discussed are other parliamentary initiatives aimed at restricting media freedom. © 2008 Sage Publications.","Jacob Zuma; Political parties; South African politics; Structure of the media; Thabo Mbeki",,,,,,,,,,"Bond, P., New President Wont Alter Course (2008) The Mercury; (2007) Daily News; Du Preez, M., Zuma may be the Broom that Sweeps Clean (2007) Daily News; Gumede, W.M., Wrong Contenders (2007) WeekendWitness; Forde, F., What the World is Saying about Zumas Triumph (2007) Daily News; Kupe, T., No, the Election Will Not be Decided by Books or the Media (2007) Maverick, 3 (1), pp. 40-3; Louw, P.E., South African Media Policy: Debates of the 1990s, , Bellville: Anthropos; (2008) Media Institute of Southern Africa, , http://www.journalism.co.za/insight/planned-changes-to-film-law-will- leave-media-unfree-3.html; Muller, J., Press houses at War: A brief history of nasionale pers and perskor (1987) The Press in South Africa, , Tomaselli, R.

The media's ""instant analyses"" in the twenty-four hours following the debate was decidedly one-sided, favoring President Bush more than Senator Kerry. We show that the news media's spin persuaded potential voters to alter their attitudes regarding the competing candidates. We rely on a multimethodological approach, including an experiment with a quasi-experimental component, a public opinion survey, and a content analysis. To examine the media's spin, we conducted a content analysis of news coverage on television, on the Internet, and in newspapers for the twenty-four hours following the final 2004 presidential debate. Second, to examine how citizens reacted to the media's coverage, we relied on a representative public opinion survey conducted immediately following the debate. In addition, we conducted an experiment where certain individuals were exposed to the debate, while others were not, and we tracked these subjects over the course of a week to determine the stability of their attitudes in the midst of intense media coverage. © 2008 Sage Publications.","Media effects; Media spin; Presidential debate",,,,,,,,,,"Abramowitz Alan, I., The impact of a presidential debate on voter rationality (1978) American Journal of Political Science, 22, pp. 680-90; Bartels Larry, M., (1988) Presidential Primaries and the Dynamics of Public Choice, , Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press; Bartels Larry, M., Messages received: The political impact of media exposure (1993) American Political Science Review, 78, pp. 267-85; Bartels Larry, M., Beyond the running tally: Partisan Bias in political perceptions (2002) Political Behavior, 24, pp. 117-50; Benoit William, L., McKinney, M.S., Stephenson., M.T., Effects of watching primary debates in the 2000 U.S. Presidential campaign (2002) Journal of Communication, 52, pp. 316-31; Bennett, W., Lance, News as reality TV: Election coverage and the democratization of truth (2005) Critical Studies in Media Communication, 22, pp. 171-7; Best Samuel, J., Hubbard, C., Maximizing'MinimalEffects:'The impact of early primary season debates on voter preferences (1999) American Politics Quarterly, 27, pp. 450-67; Andre, B., Boyer., M.M., Assessing the impact of televised debates:the case of the 1988 Canadian election (1996) British Journal of Political Science, 26, pp. 143-64; Carter Richard, F., Some effects of the debates (1977) The Great Debates: Kennedy Vs.

Communication researchers have examined public response and reaction to terrorist attacks, definitions of terrorism, policy questions, media portrayals of terrorism, and framing across different media and nations. This study undertakes a comparative framing analysis of media coverage of terrorism, as reported by prominent U.S. and U.K. newspapers, combining quantitative and qualitative methods. Findings revealed that the U.S. papers engaged in more episodic coverage and the U.K. papers in more thematic coverage of terrorism and terrorism-related events. The U.S. papers were consumed with presenting news associated with the military approach, whereas the U.K. papers were oriented toward diplomatic evaluations of terrorist events. © 2008 Sage Publications.","Framing; News; Terrorism; U.K. newspapers; U.S. newspapers",,,,,,,,,,"Baukus, R.A., Strohm, S.M., Gender differences in perceptions of media reports of the gulf and Afghan conflicts (2002) Communication and Terrorism: Public and Media Responses to 9/11, pp. 275-87. , B.

The result was a distinctive interaction between media industries and the academy that produced many major books, studies, and other intellectual products including a journal that informed the media-society relationship. A joint venture of a university and a media foundation with special links to journalism education and media industries in the United States and internationally, the program decamped from Columbia in 1996 and was phased out two years later. © 2003, SAGE Publications.

It shows that, in contrast to U.S. news organizations committed to public journalism, Danish news organizations have (1) advocated specific solutions to problems, (2) made special efforts to highlight the concerns of traditionally marginalized publics, and (3) encouraged citizens to develop substantive, systemic solutions while using experts as citizen advisors. The study concludes that while the character of the Danish public journalism initiatives could be attributed to the professional self-understanding of Danish journalists, it also could be understood as one of many manifestations of the increasing populism of Danish news media more generally. © 2003, SAGE Publications.

The investigation proceeds in two stages. First, an agenda-setting analysis demonstrates a strong connection between the salience of foreign affairs in the media and the salience of foreign affairs for the public. Second, two potential effects of varying issue salience on foreign policymaking are examined: (1) issue priming and (2) policymakers' reactions to issue salience. Analyses rely on a combination of U.S. and U.K. commercial polling data and the American National Election Study. Results point to the importance of mass media and issue salience in the relationship between public opinion and foreign policy. © 2003, SAGE Publications.

While the history of the media is interesting in and of itself, it is presented to establish the journalistic ideology into which Tanzanian media practitioners were socialized as the result of the country's adoption, upon receiving independence, of a one-party political system and a socialist economic system. This media history serves as a backdrop for the empirical portion of this paper. Using type of ownership (government, party, and private) as a classifying variable, the empirical study then captures Tanzanian journalists' opinion profile with regard to private and government media traits. The journalistic ideology of the controlled period, wherein media played a role in national development, is apparent particularly in journalists' attribution of traits to government and private media: The former will unify and develop the country; the latter will develop an informed citizenry but also be sensationalistic and unethical. Not surprisingly, in some instances, the assignment of traits to government and private media was related to ownership of place of employment of the respondents. © 2003, SAGE Publications.

What has not been systematically analyzed is whether the stories that report margin of error use this information correctly to interpret and present poll results. This study examines poll reporting on the network evening news during the 2000 presidential general election. Of the seventy-eight stories that reported findings from specific polls, forty-five (55 percent) included information about the sampling error. For the stories in which the accuracy of horse-race declarations could be assessed by the data used in the story, 47 percent were “inaccurate” because they misused the term statistical dead heat, claimed that one candidate was ahead when the results were within the margin of error (and not qualified as such), or said that the results were “outside of the margin of error” when they were not. These mistakes were most prevalent on NBC. Some of these inaccurate reports revealed a fundamental misunderstanding about what plus or minus means. As a result, changes in likely voters' preferences were exaggerated during the general election campaign. © 2003, SAGE Publications.

This makes sense, but it can also lead to some misunderstandings, especially because an incomplete or distorted sense of what took place in the movement associated with the word Tiananmen comes into play, thanks to the way that struggle has been misremembered (e.g., as one in which only students took part when many who protested and many who suffered were from other social groups). Too often, audiences are left with the mistaken idea that the only important continuities in the recent history of Chinese protest have to do with the repressive measures used by the regime. Using the March 2002 demonstrations by workers in Northeast China as a starting point, this article argues that there are many links between the Tiananmen and post-Tiananmen periods relating to everything from the kinds of Chinese people who have taken to the streets to the sorts of issues that bring them there. © 2003, SAGE Publications.

It argues that studies on the formation of domestic political news agendas have so far largely been election campaign centered. Using the annual party political conventions in Britain as a case study, this article explores internal party struggles between the leadership and their opponents to shape and reshape the coverage of party policy on national television. It reveals that despite resource disadvantages, dissenting voices in certain situations can shape the news agenda. The article also reveals that broadcasting professionals find conflict newsworthy and are eager to reveal such discord to their viewers and highlight its consequences for each party's electoral fortunes. In conclusion, the article suggests that in certain situations, domestic political news agendas also need to be seen as the product of intraparty competition between the leadership and their opponents. In these situations, journalists play a proactive role packaging the struggle and may act as a counterweight to leadership resource advantages, aiding critical claim-makers in obtaining their objectives. © 2003, SAGE Publications.

Unlike “feeding frenzies,” which have been well documented, there has been almost no serious examination of cases in which reporters engage in “responsibility frenzies.” In this article, the author discusses a case of one such responsibility frenzy: rumors during Hillary Clinton's 2000 U.S. Senate campaign that she was a lesbian. Using interviews, personal observation, and news accounts, I explain how the press avoided irresponsible coverage and engaged in enlightened self-restraint. While responsibility frenzies admittedly are much more rare than feeding frenzies, it is important to understand the dynamics of the former and the factors that lead the press to act responsibly. © 2003, SAGE Publications.

And how do different forms of a candidate's appearance in television news affect his or her perception by the viewer? These are the major research questions we pursued using a large-scale content analysis of German television news coverage of the 1998 general election. The results show that German candidates still have a substantial opportunity on television news to speak to the people in their own words. The results also indicate that the degree of authenticity has a strong effect on the perception of the candidate by the television viewer. Pictures convey a better impression than just verbal news about the candidate, and original sound bites with pictures leave a better impression than pictures with just the voice-over. Results are discussed in light of the different media cultures in the United States and Germany and of the shifting balance of power between politicians and journalists. © 2003, SAGE Publications.
