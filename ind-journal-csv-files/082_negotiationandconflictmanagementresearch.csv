Regardless of the type of organization or institution, sustainable diversity and inclusion integration requires difficult conversations that can correspond with locale-specific interventions and deep cultural transformation. We led a series of design sessions with stakeholders from two undergraduate engineering programs at a large, Midwestern, research university aimed at creating prototype solutions to diversity and inclusion problems. Following the sessions, we conducted interviews with 19 stakeholders to understand their perceptions of the design process in facilitating both difficult conversations and in enacting meaningful change. Our study uncovered that organizational cultures impacted participants’ perceptions of change possibilities and their role in change. We conclude with recommendations for adopting design practices and communication-as-design processes to create structures and interactive approaches for facilitating conversations toward inclusionary organizational change. © 2020 International Association of Conflict Management and Wiley Periodicals LLC.","communication as design; design thinking; engineering cultures; organizational change; organizational culture",,,,,,"Wallace H.

National Science Foundation, NSF","This present study is part of a larger, three-year National Science Foundation funded project that applies design principles to transform organizational cultures of engineering. In this article, we examine the impact of design toward addressing these issues in BME and ECE programs by interviewing participants following their participation in design sessions. Additionally, we supplemented the interview data with video-recorded observations of the design sessions, artifacts collected from the design sessions, and field notes. In the 2017?2018 academic year, we conducted six design sessions for both BME and ECE. The design sessions brought together various school stakeholders (e.g., faculty, staff, undergraduate and graduate students, and alumni) to create prototype solutions to organizational issues pertaining to both schools. Following both the BME and ECE design sessions, we conducted interviews with twelve participants in BME, and seven participants in ECE to understand their experiences within the process. The design sessions refer to a series of 12 meetings (six sessions in BME in the Fall 2017 semester; six sessions in ECE in the Spring 2018 semester) that occurred over the 2017?2018 academic year (see Table?1). All sessions were organized and facilitated by expert members of the research team that have nearly three decades of experience in teaching, leading, and utilizing design efforts in both industry and academic settings. The curriculum was created using a variety of design materials and templates from sources including Stanford?s d.school (?Tools for taking action?, n.d.) and consultations with an alumna of the ECE School who had 30+ years of professional design work at an international automotive company. Each design session cohort included stakeholders as designers (e.g., faculty, staff, undergraduate and graduate students, alumni, postdoctoral scholars, administrators from the campus intercultural centers, and members from the research team) from both the BME (Fall 2017) and ECE (Spring 2018) programs. Table?1 briefly describes the six-session template used for both BME and ECE. At the end of both the BME and ECE design sessions, the design stakeholders developed initial prototype solutions aimed at addressing the interconnected issues of D&I, preparation for professional practice, and creating a more integrated sociotechnical understanding of engineering within both programs. The BME stakeholders developed four solutions to address these issues: (a) a multifaceted outreach and recruitment program; (b) a stronger definition of BME identity; (c) a mentoring program; and (d) an ongoing D&I assessment program. The ECE stakeholders developed three solutions to address these issues within their program: (a) a teaching assistant training aimed at addressing intercultural student interactions; (b) a junior-level professional development seminar, and (c) integration of multidisciplinary and vertically integrated design experiences throughout the ECE curriculum. Following the design sessions for both BME and ECE cohorts, we interviewed 19 design participants from BME and ECE. The research team conducted interviews with 12 BME participants (six faculty members, three staff members, and three students), who represented 80% of the BME design cohort. We also conducted interviews with seven ECE participants (one alumna, one graduate student, two undergraduate students, two staff members, and one faculty member), which represented 32% of the ECE design cohort. The study utilized semistructured interviews to understand participants? perceptions of their experiences in the design sessions. Participants were interviewed regarding their perception of the design sessions (e.g., ?What did you think about the design sessions?? ?What did you think about this approach??), the design sessions? connections to D&I (?How did the design sessions illuminate systemic barriers in [BME/ECE]?), and recommendations for improving the design sessions. Interviews averaged 33?min per interview, and were transcribed by a third-party transcription service, which generated 274 single-spaced pages of interview text (an average of 13.05 pages per interview). The interviews were deidentified, and participants were given pseudonyms to protect their identities. All identifiable information in the interviews was removed. The secondary data came from two key places. First, to supplement the interview data, the first author?s notes and observations from both the BME and ECE design sessions and interviews were used. Second, design session artifacts and video recordings were also referenced to further contextualize the participants? descriptions and experiences. All study protocols and materials were approved by IRB. Organizational culture is not necessarily revealed in isolation; rather, it is revealed in and by individuals? shared understanding of experiences (Keyton, 2014). We analyzed the 19 interviews using a constant comparative method (Corbin & Strauss, 2015). During the first round of coding, the first author read through each interview line by line, making notes of initial codes that appeared in the transcripts in NVivo. In the second round of coding, initial codes were grouped into broader categories or themes. For instance, initial codes like ?vulnerability in sharing stories,? ?new perspectives on D&I,? and ?evolution of a narrow definition of D&I? were grouped into categories like ?Design sessions fostering a deeper understanding of D&I issues.? The first author paid attention to sensitizing issues, descriptions, and experiences where the effectiveness of topics, conversations, and activities surrounding the design process was mentioned. Throughout the analysis process, he also referred to: observational notes that he made as a cofacilitator of the design sessions; audio recordings of the design sessions? artifacts from the design sessions; and video data of the design sessions that provide a deeper context for momentary interactions shared by the BME and ECE design cohorts. Taken together, these moments throughout the interviews and observations provide insights into how both BME and ECE organizational cultures impact, embrace, and integrate change possibilities through design. To ensure the accuracy of themes, the results were discussed with the other authors and the design session participants for further refinement and clarity. Through several meetings, the research team read through transcripts, discussed emerging findings, and engaged in iterative mapping of codes to refine the themes. All researchers were familiar with design, organizational issues, and have worked in engineering education, biomedical engineering, and/or electrical engineering. In the next section, we share the results of the thematic analyses framed within the two contexts of BME and ECE.",,,"Aakhus, M., Communication as design (2007) Communication Monographs, 74 (1), pp. 112-117. , https://doi.org/10.1080/03637750701196383; Aakhus, M., Rumsey, E., Crafting supportive communication online: A communication design analysis of conflict in an online support group (2010) Journal of Applied Communication Research, 38 (1), pp. 65-84. , https://doi.org/10.1080/00909880903483581; Barbour, J., Gill, R., Barge, J., Organizational communication design logics: A theory of communicative intervention and collective communication design (2018) Communication Theory, 28 (3), pp. 332-353. , https://doi.org/10.1093/ct/qtx005; Bowman, N., Promoting sustained engagement with diversity: The reciprocal relationships between informal and formal college diversity experiences (2012) The Review of Higher Education, 36 (1), pp. 1-24. , https://doi.org/10.1353/rhe.2012.0057; Brown, T., Design thinking (2008) Harvard Business Review, 86 (6), pp. 84-92; Brown, T., (2009) Change by design, , New York, NY, Harper Collins; Brown, T., Katz, B., Change by design (2011) Journal of Product Innovation Management, 28 (3), pp. 381-383. , https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1540-5885.2011.00806.x; Buchanan, R., Wicked problems in design thinking (1992) Design Issues, 8 (2), pp. 5-21. , https://doi.org/10.2307/1511637; Buchanan, R., Worlds in the making: Design, management, and the reform of organizational culture (2015) She Ji, 1 (1), pp. 5-21. , https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sheji.2015.09.003; Buzzanell, P.M., Constituting intercultural harmony by design thinking: Conflict management in, for and about diversity and inclusion work (2017) Conflict management and intercultural communication, pp. 66-84. , X.

Thus, especially in asymmetric settings, moral inclusion and moral responsibility toward members of other groups are crucial to dialogue, conflict resolution, and reconciliation. Yet it is exactly the circumstances of asymmetry—involving threat and dehumanization—that pose barriers to the elicitation and sustaining of moral concern. Drawing on and integrating two separate research traditions—the psychology of intergroup conflict, dialogue and peace building, and communication research on “mediated suffering”—this article discusses perceptions, representations, and emotions that underlie recognition of and empathy toward the suffering of others with the aim of increasing our understanding of when and how we can be brought—through mediated and unmediated dialogues and encounters—to care about the suffering of others. © 2020 International Association of Conflict Management and Wiley Periodicals LLC.","conflict resolution;

But these conflicts can also be managed constructively. Two laboratory studies investigating the underlying social–psychological dynamics of more tractable versus intractable moral conflicts are presented, which tested a core proposition derived from a dynamical systems theory of intractable conflict. It portrays more intractable conflicts as those, which have lost the complexity inherent to more constructive social relations and have collapsed into overly simplified, closed patterns of thinking, feeling, and acting that resist change. Employing our Difficult Conversations Lab paradigm in which participants engage in genuine discussions over moral differences, we found that higher levels of cognitive, emotional, and behavioral complexity were associated with more tractable conversations. Whereas in a pilot study we examined conflicts that naturally became more/less intractable, in our main experiment, high versus low levels of cognitive complexity were induced. © 2020 The Authors.

The essay is structured in four sections. First, we present a highly controversial conflict case story of the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) that was recently passed in India. The real-life case story is embedded in the nexus of multifaceted identity conflict and multileveled socioecological interpretations. Second, we introduce the socioecological (SE) framework and its essential principles and illustrative examples of the various levels of analysis. Third, we review selective assumptions of the integrative identity negotiation theory (IINT) and, together with the SE framework, analyze the CAA India case story with explanatory depth and multilevel insights. Fourth, we conclude with a summary and seven strategy recommendations that can be applied to managing polarized intergroup conflict complexity constructively. © 2020 International Association of Conflict Management and Wiley Periodicals LLC.","Citizenship Amendment Act; identity negotiation theory; intercultural conflict competence; intergroup conflict; intergroup dialogue; social–ecological analysis",,,,,,,,,,"(2019), www.uscirf.gov, .

There are two typical research trends for analyzing group conflict. These are either a rational model or intractable conflict model. The rational model assumes that differences are over realistic issues such as scarce resources. The intractable model focuses on identity and emotions. Intractable conflicts are recalcitrant, nonrational, and particularly resistant to resolution. They generate difficult conversations. The argument here demonstrates how intractability establishes the descriptive conditions for difficult conversations about conflicts. These conditions are incommensurate cultural narratives, narrative particularity, existential threat, power differences, and delegitimization. Islam and the West and the Israelis and Palestinians are used as examples. Finally, such difficult divides must attend to five issues that ameliorate difficult conversations, namely, inclusion, maximization of arguments and reasons, controlling undue influences, dialogic equality, and the value of deliberation. © 2020 International Association of Conflict Management and Wiley Periodicals LLC.","difficult conversations; ethnopolitical conflict; intergroup conflict; Islam",,,,,,,,,,"Abu-Nimer, M., Conflict resolution in an Islamic context: Some conceptual questions (1996) Peace & Change, 21, pp. 22-40. , https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1468-0130.1996.tb00253.x; Atran, S., Ginges, J., Religious and sacred imperatives in human conflict (2012) Science, 336, pp. 855-857. , https://doi.org/10.1126/science.1216902; Bar-On, D., (2000) Bridging the gap: Storytelling as a way to work through political and collective hostilities, , Hamburg, Germany, Kober-Stiftung; Bar-Tal, D., Teichman, Y., (2006) Stereotypes and prejudice in conflict: Representations of Arabs in Israeli Jewish society, , Cambridge, UK, Cambridge University Press; Bateson, G., (1972) Steps to an ecology of mind, , New York, NY, Chandler Publishing; Benhabib, S., (2002) The claims of culture: Equality and diversity in the global era, , Princeton, NJ, Princeton University Press; Blake, R.R., Mouton, J.S., (1964) The managerial grid, , Houston, TX, Gulf; Bohman, J., Political communication and the epistemic value of diversity: Deliberation and legitimation in media societies (2007) Communication Theory, 17, pp. 348-355. , https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1468-2885.2007.00301.x; Cai, D.A., Fink, E.L., Conflict style differences between individuals and collectivists (2002) Communication Monographs, 69, pp. 67-87. , https://doi.org/10.1080/03637750216536; Chang, R., Introduction (1997) Incommensurability, incomparability, and practical reason, pp. 1-34. , R.

The aim of this study was to conduct an integrated analysis of mediation by taking into account the perceptions of mediators working for the Mediation Service and those of the service users over a period of one year. The obtained results show statistically significant differences in the two groups’ analyzed response patterns associated with a series of factors that predict trust-building (the mediator's legal expertise; suggesting an alternative; sincerity; focusing on settling the dispute; the appointment of a mediator by public authorities and/or by a recognized service; focusing on the parties’ common goals; highlighting the rules of mediation; and devoting some time to talking about informal matters). The identification of these factors contributes to improved training and professional practices in the field of mediation. © 2019 International Association for Conflict Management and Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","mediation; rapport; relationship of support; therapeutic alliance; trust",,,,,,,,,,"Butler, J.K., Trust expectations, information sharing, climate of trust and negotiation effectiveness and efficiency (1999) Group & Organization Management, 24 (2), pp. 217-238. , https://doi.org/10.1177/1059601199242005; Davis, A., Gadlin, H., Mediators gain trust the old-fashioned way—We earn it!

From this perspective, parties instantaneously realize their outcomes when agreement is reached. Although this conception may also reflect the understanding of some negotiators (those with what we call a “fixed agreement” mindset), we argue that others actually envision agreement as one step in an ongoing process (what we call a “fluid agreement” mindset). To spur research on this topic, we report initial progress on development of a new measure of agreement fluidity. Basic psychometric properties for this measure were established using six correlational samples that demonstrate aspects of both discriminant and convergent validity. Fixed agreement mindset appears to predict important behaviors during and after the negotiation process. © 2019 International Association for Conflict Management and Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","agreements; contract; entity theory; mindset; negotiation; personality",,,,,,,,,,"Adair, W., Brett, J., The negotiation dance: Time, culture, and behavioral sequences in negotiation (2005) Organization Science, 16 (1), pp. 33-51. , https://doi.org/10.1287/orsc.1040.0102; Anderlini, L., Felli, L., Incomplete contracts and complexity costs (1999) Theory and Decision, 46 (1), pp. 23-50; Barboza, D., Bowley, G., Cox, A., (2013) New York Times, , .

In this article, we review the current research on conflict management and family firms and suggest theoretical propositions about the influence of familiness in constructive conflict management in family firms. We propose that specific levels of structural, cognitive, and relational dimensions of familiness configure a specific arrangement of resources that we conceptualized as collaborative familiness, which enhances constructive conflict. We discuss the main implications of this conceptualization in terms of its theoretical contributions, further research, and practice. © 2019 International Association for Conflict Management and Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","constructive conflict management; familiness; family firms; literature review",,,,,,,,,,"Alderson, K., Conflict management and resolution in family-owned businesses: A practitioner focused review (2015) Journal of Family Business Management, 5 (2), pp. 140-156. , https://doi.org/10.1108/JFBM-08-2015-0030; Amarapurkar, S.S., Danes, S.M., Farm business-owning couples: Interrelationships among business tensions, relationship conflict quality, and spousal satisfaction (2005) Journal of Family and Economic Issues, 26, pp. 419-441. , https://doi.org/10.1007/s10834-005-5905-6; Arregle, J.L., Hitt, M.A., Sirmon, D.G., Very, P., The development of organizational social capital: Attributes of family firms (2007) Journal of Management Studies, 44 (1), pp. 73-95. , https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-6486.2007.00665.x; Arteaga, R., Menéndez-Requejo, S., Family Constitution and Business Performance: Moderating Factors (2017) Family Business Review, 30, pp. 320-338. , https://doi.org/10.1177/0894486517732438; Barney, J.B., Resource-based theories of competitive advantage: A ten-year retrospective on the resource-based view (2001) Journal of Management, 27, pp. 643-650. , https://doi.org/10.1177/014920630102700602; Basco, R., Family business and regional development—A theoretical model of regional familiness (2015) Journal of Family Business Strategy, 6, pp. 259-271. , https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jfbs.2015.04.004; Basco, R., Voordeckers, W., The relationship between the board of directors and firm performance in private family firms: A test of the demographic versus behavioral approach (2015) Journal of Management & Organization, 21, pp. 411-435. , https://doi.org/10.1017/jmo.2015.23; Belli, S., Broncano, F., Trust as a Meta-Emotion (2017) Metaphilosophy, 48, pp. 430-448. , https://doi.org/10.1111/meta.12255; Bird, M., Zellweger, T., Relational embeddedness and firm growth: Comparing spousal and sibling entrepreneurs (2018) Organization Science, 29 (2), pp. 264-283; Borbély, A., Caputo, A., Approaching negotiation at the organizational level (2017) Negotiation and Conflict Management Research, 10, pp. 306-323. , https://doi.org/10.1111/ncmr.12106; Cabrera-Suárez, M.K., de la Cruz Déniz-Déniz, M., Martín-Santana, J.D., Familiness and market orientation: A stakeholder approach (2011) Journal of Family Business Strategy, 2 (1), pp. 34-42. , https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jfbs.2011.01.001; Cabrera-Suárez, M.K., García-Almeida, D.J., De Saá-Pérez, P., A dynamic network model of the successor's knowledge construction from the resource-and knowledge-based view of the family firm (2018) Family Business Review, 31 (2), pp. 178-197. , https://doi.org/10.1177/0894486518776867; Caputo, A., Marzi, G., Pellegrini, M., Rialti, R., Conflict Management in Family Businesses: A Bibliometric Analysis and Systematic Literature Review (2018) International Journal of Conflict Management, 29, pp. 519-542. , https://doi.org/10.1108/IJCMA-02-2018-0027; Carr, J.C., Cole, M.S., Ring, J.K., Blettner, D.P., A measure of variations in internal social capital among family firms (2011) Entrepreneurship Theory and Practice, 35, pp. 1207-1227. , https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1540-6520.2011.00499.x; Cater, J.J., III, Kidwell, R.E., Function, governance, and trust in successor leadership groups in family firms (2014) Journal of Family Business Strategy, 5, pp. 217-228. , https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jfbs.2013.06.001; Chandler, G.N., Article commentary: Control structures used in family business to manage wealth: Operationalization of antecedent and outcome variables (2015) Entrepreneurship Theory and Practice, 39, pp. 1305-1312. , https://doi.org/10.1111/etap.12175; Chirico, F., Nordqvist, M., Colombo, G., Mollona, E., Simulating dynamic capabilities and value creation in family firms: Is paternalism an “asset” or a “liability”?

These experiences, over the course of 23 years, provide examples of how theory and research can be used to guide practice. The account is chronological, beginning with my first consulting assignment in 1975, where I worked with a US delegation on resolving a negotiation impasse, to the 1990s where I directed study groups on a variety of human performance and international conflict resolution topics. These projects consisted both of applications of research-based knowledge and the generation of research ideas for new projects. By immersing myself in both theory and practice, I could transform basic research into applied insights and induce research ideas from practice.

Rapoport’s contributions spanned scientific disciplines and included the application of mathematical models to biology and the social sciences, alongside metatheoretical work bridging semantics, ethics, and philosophy. Known for formulating the “Tit for Tat” strategy, his approach to game theory reflected a nuanced understanding of knowledge, wisdom, and ethics; the differences, for example, between modeling behavior—what works as an algorithm in a structured game—and solving complex human social interactions. While developing a science of human conflict, Rapoport focused on simple ideas to promote cooperation; his ultimate goal was to foster world peace. A career overview alongside testimonials by scholars and family provide a glimpse of Anatol Rapoport, the scientist and the person. The legacy and thinking of Anatol Rapoport continue to resonate and reverberate today whenever we conduct rigorous scholarship toward transforming conflict into peaceful harmony, whether among people or nations. © 2019 International Association for Conflict Management and Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","conflict; cooperation; ethics; general systems theory; peace; Prisoner’s Dilemma; semantics; Tit for Tat",,,,,,,,,,"Axelrod, R., Effective choice in the prisoner’s dilemma (1980) Journal of Conflict Resolution, 24 (1), pp. 3-25. , https://doi.org/10.1177/002200278002400101, March); Axelrod, R., More effective choice in the prisoner's dilemma (1980) Journal of Conflict Resolution, 24, pp. 379-403. , https://doi.org/10.1177/002200278002400301, Sep.); Axelrod, R., (1984) The evolution of cooperation, , New York, NY, Basic Books; Ben-Artzi, R., Cristal, M., Kopelman, S., Conceptualizing conflict management and conflict resolution as distinct negotiation processes in the context of the enduring Israeli-Palestinian conflict (2015) Negotiation and Conflict Management Research, 8 (1), pp. 56-63. , https://doi.org/10.1111/ncmr.12046; Boulding, J.R., Clements, K.P., Morrison, M.L., Strimling Yodsampa, A., Elise Boulding's legacy to the twenty-first century: reflections on her contributions to understanding conflict and peace (2016) Negotiation and Conflict Management Research, 9 (4), pp. 274-291. , https://doi.org/10.1111/ncmr.12078; Braithwaite, R.B., (1955) Theory of games as a tool for the moral philosopher, , Cambridge, UK, Cambridge University Press; Cull, P., The mathematical biophysics of Nicolas Rashevsky (2007) BioSystems, 88 (3), pp. 178-184. , https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biosystems.2006.11.003; Deutsch, M., Trust and suspicion (1958) Journal of Conflict Resolution, 2 (4), pp. 265-279. , https://doi.org/10.1177/002200275800200401; Diekmann, A., (1984) Freiwilligendilemma, , Working paper 206, Institute for Advanced Studies Vienna, February 1984; Diekmann, A., Volunteer’s dilemma (1985) Journal of Conflict Resolution, 29, pp. 605-610. , https://doi.org/10.1177/0022002785029004003; Diekmann, A., Mitter, P., (1986) Paradoxical effects of social behavior: Essays in honor of Anatol Rapoport, , (Eds.)

In an experimental study, 420 managers read a negotiation case study example set in a familiar or unfamiliar industry and answered either broadening or narrowing questions about an example. Managers given broadening questions about an example set in an unfamiliar industry were more open to learning than managers who were asked narrowing questions about an example set in a familiar industry. Openness to learning in turn fostered successfully applying the key negotiation principle to resolve a subsequent face-to-face negotiation. The findings suggest that negotiation training for professionals is unlikely to meet its intended purpose if it relies on offering managers examples set in their own industries and encouraging them to answer questions about the contextual specifics of those examples. © 2019 International Association for Conflict Management and Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","example familiarity; expertise; knowledge transfer; learning; management education; negotiation pedagogy; openness; question type",,,,,,,,,,"Adair, W.L., Okumura, T., Brett, J.M., Negotiation behavior when cultures collide: The U.S. and Japan (2001) Journal of Applied Psychology, 86, pp. 371-385. , https://doi.org/10.1037//0021-9010.86.3.371; Alfieri, L., Nokes-Malach, T.J., Schunn, C.D., Learning through case comparisons: A meta-analytic review (2013) Educational Psychologist, 48, pp. 87-113. , https://doi.org/10.1080/00461520.2013.775712; Ancona, D., Bresman, H., Kaeufer, K., The comparative advantage of X-teams (2002) MIT Sloan Management Review, 43, pp. 33-39; Argyris, C., Schon, D., (1996) Organizational learning II: Theory, method, and practice, , Reading, MA, Addison-Wesley Longman; Bazerman, M.H., Curhan, J.R., Moore, D.A., Valley, K.L., Negotiation (2000) Annual Review of Psychology, 51, pp. 279-314. , https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev.psych.51.1.279; Bazerman, M.H., Gillespie, J.J., Betting on the future: The virtues of contingent contracts (1999) Harvard Business Review, 77, pp. 155-160; Blau, P.M., (1955) The dynamics of bureaucracy, , Chicago, IL, University of Chicago Press; Bottom, W.P., Negotiator risk: Sources of uncertainty and the impact of reference points on negotiated agreements (1998) Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes, 76, pp. 89-112. , https://doi.org/10.1006/obhd.1998.2800; Brett, J.M., Okumura, T., Inter- and intracultural negotiation: US and Japanese negotiators (1998) Academy of Management Journal, 41, pp. 495-510. , https://doi.org/10.5465/256938; Burt, R.S., (1992) Structural holes, , Cambridge, MA, Harvard University Press; Colhoun, J., Gentner, D., Loewenstein, J., (2008) Leaving abstract principles through principal-case comparison, pp. 1659-1664. , B.

Many typologies of conflict styles are built on the premise that level of cooperation versus competition, as well as directness versus indirectness, underlie various conflict styles. Grounded in a communication perspective, the present study uses dyadic data from 256 romantic couples to examine how self-reported tendencies to use each of six conflict styles—collaborating, compromising, competitive fighting, yielding, avoiding, and indirect fighting—associate with how (un)cooperative and (in)direct partners generally perceive actors to be during conflict, as well as how relationally satisfied both members of the dyad are. The associations that emerged suggest each of the six styles has a unique profile, that a comprehensive typology of conflict styles should include indirect fighting as well as a more neutral avoiding style, and that compromising is a weak form of collaborating that is lower in cooperativeness and directness. © 2019 International Association for Conflict Management and Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","conflict; conflict style; interpersonal communication; interpersonal conflict; relational satisfaction",,,,,,,,,,"Acitelli, L.K., Douvan, E., Veroff, J., Perceptions of conflict in the first year of marriage: How important are similarity and understanding?

As a result, teams must engage in information sharing, exchange, and processing that optimize the use of each team member's knowledge. Accordingly, we invoked a framework called SUIT, based on the theory of constructive controversy, that teaches teams to effectively share, understand, integrate, and make team decisions. We also considered whether a training program developed in accordance with the SUIT principles has stronger effects for virtual teams (VTs) relative to face-to-face (FtF) teams, given that VTs tend to need more information sharing and decision-making support. Using a fully crossed and balanced experimental design, we found that teams receiving SUIT training reported greater constructive controversy levels and, in turn, higher objective task performance. The communication medium did not moderate this effect. © 2019 International Association for Conflict Management and Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","conflict; constructive controversy; teamwork; training; virtual teams",,,,,,"Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada, SSHRC",,,,"Adair, W.L., Liang, L.H., Hideg, I., Buffering against the detrimental effects of demographic faultlines: The curious case of intragroup conflict in small work groups (2017) Negotiation and Conflict Management Research, 10, pp. 28-45. , https://doi.org/10.1111/ncmr.12087; Alper, S., Tjosvold, D., Law, K.S., Interdependence and controversy in group decision making: Antecedents to effective self-managing teams (1998) Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes, 74, pp. 33-52. , https://doi.org/10.1006/obhd.1998.2748; Amason, A.C., Distinguishing the effects of functional and dysfunctional conflict on strategic decision making: Resolving a paradox for top management teams (1996) Academy of Management Journal, 39, pp. 123-148. , https://doi.org/10.2307/256633; Baltes, B.B., Dickson, M.W., Sherman, M.P., Bauer, C.C., LaGanke, J.S., Computer-mediated communication and group decision making: A meta-analysis (2002) Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes, 87, pp. 156-179. , https://doi.org/10.1006/obhd.2001.2961; Beersma, B., Hollenbeck, J.R., Conlon, D.E., Humphrey, S.E., Moon, H., Ilgen, D.R., Cutthroat cooperation: The effects of team role decisions on adaptation to alternative reward structures (2009) Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes, 108, pp. 131-142. , https://doi.org/10.1016/j.obhdp.2008.07.002; Bell, S.T., Brown, S.G., Weiss, J.A., A conceptual framework for leveraging team composition decisions to build human capital (2018) Human Resource Management Review, 28, pp. 450-463. , https://doi.org/10.1016/j.hrmr.2017.06.003; Bliese, P.D., Group size, ICC values, and group-level correlations: A simulation (1998) Organizational Research Methods, 1, pp. 355-373. , https://doi.org/10.1177/109442819814001; Bliese, P.D., Within-group agreement, non-independence, and reliability: Implications for data aggregation and analysis (2000) Multilevel theory, research, and methods in organizations, pp. 349-381. , K.

Managing conflicts among followers is an essential responsibility of leaders. The way leaders behave while managing such conflicts have received little academic attention; available studies have focused on business contexts. This study aimed to examine the relationship between servant leadership, and emotional exhaustion through team conflicts, and further investigates the mediating role of leaders’ third-party conflict behaviors such as avoiding, forcing, and problem-solving. Data were gathered from 453 religious sisters (followers), in 166 convents, in a Catholic Women Religious Institute mostly based in Nigeria. Structural equation modeling confirmed that servant leadership was associated with reduced team conflicts through leaders’ third-party behaviors. Further findings showed that perceived servant leadership was negatively related to emotional exhaustion through a nonforcing expression. We discussed theoretical and practical implications. © 2020 International Association of Conflict Management and Wiley Periodicals LLC.","emotional exhaustion; female leadership; servant leadership; team conflict; third-party behaviors",,,,,,,,,,"Alvarado-Alvarez, C., Armadans, I., Parada, M.J., Tracing the roots of constructive conflict management in family firms (2020) Negotiation and Conflict Management Research, 13 (2), pp. 105-126. , https://doi.org/10.1111/ncmr.12164; Babakus, E., Yavas, U., Ashill, N.J., Service worker burnout and turnover intentions: Roles of person-job fit, servant leadership, and customer orientation (2010) Services Marketing Quarterly, 32 (1), pp. 17-31. , https://doi.org/10.1080/15332969.2011.533091; Babalola, M.T., Stouten, J., Euwema, M.C., Ovadje, F., The relation between ethical leadership and workplace conflicts: The mediating role of employee resolution efficacy (2018) Journal of Management, 44, pp. 2037-2063. , https://doi.org/10.1177/0149206316638163; Baillien, E., Bollen, K., Euwema, M., De Witte, H., Conflicts and conflict management styles as precursors of workplace bullying: A two-wave longitudinal study (2014) European Journal of Work and Organizational Psychology, 23, pp. 511-524. , https://doi.org/10.1080/1359432X.2012.752899; Bendersky, C., Hays, N.A., Status conflict in groups (2012) Organization Science, 23 (2), pp. 323-340. , https://doi.org/10.1287/orsc.1110.0734; Benharda, I., Brett, J.M., Lempereur, A., Gender and role in conflict management: Female and male managers as third parties (2013) Negotiation and Conflict Management Research, 6 (2), pp. 79-93. , https://doi.org/10.1111/ncmr.12004; Bianchi, R., Schonfeld, I.S., Laurent, E., Burnout–depression overlap: A review (2015) Clinical Psychology Review, 36, pp. 28-41. , https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cpr.2015.01.004; Bollen, K., Euwema, M., Angry at your boss: Who cares?

Role in the conflict as initiator/responder, medium difference, the press role in each press system, and partisanship of news media were hypothesized to affect the war and peace journalism practice. Moreover, the trade conflict was divided into three stages to test the applicability of the “foreign policy market equilibrium hypothesis” by analyzing the changes in the uses of sources and presence of competing frames over time. US news media were found to employ more war journalism and less peace journalism than their Chinese counterpart. They also had much lower coverage of the conflict than their Chinese counterpart. Newspapers were more likely to use war journalism than television. US partisan liberal media selectively supported and opposed the US government trade policy. © 2020 International Association of Conflict Management and Wiley Periodicals LLC.","China; conflict role; foreign policy foreign policy; peace journalism; press system; trade conflict; trade war; United States; US-China media comparison",,,,,,,,,,"Althaus, S., Edy, J., Entman, R., Phalen, P., Revising the indexing hypothesis: Officials, media, and the Libya crisis (1996) Political Communication, 13 (4), pp. 407-421. , https://doi.org/10.1080/10584609.1996.9963128; Bastiansen, H.G., Klimke, M., Werenskjold, R., (2019) Media and the cold war in the 1980s: Between star wars and glasnost, , (Eds.)

We explore mimicry of specific word categories and perceptions of rapport, trust, and liking as underlying mechanisms. Dyads took part in an online negotiation exercise in which word mimicry was manipulated: Participants were instructed to mimic each other’s words (both-mimic), one participant mimicked the other (half-mimic), or neither participant mimicked (neither-mimic). When given a simple instruction to mimic their partner, participants mimicked both the style (personal pronouns, adverbs, linguistic style, interrogative terms) and the content (affiliation terms, power terms, and assents) of their partner’s messages. Mimicry was associated with greater joint and individual points gain and perceptions of rapport from the mimicked partner. Further, mimicry of interrogative terms (e.g., how, why) mediated positive effects of mimicry upon negotiation outcomes, suggesting the coordination of question asking between negotiators is an important strategy to create beneficial interactions and add value in negotiations. © 2020 The Authors.

To answer this question, we drew on the cognitive flexibility theory and proposed a model predicting that negotiators’ mental fatigue would engender fewer creative agreements, and their integrative complexity acted as an underlying mechanism. Across four studies, we measured (Study 1) and manipulated (Studies 2–4) mental fatigue to test our hypotheses. We found that negotiation dyads with higher mental fatigue were less likely to display integrative complexity and hence less likely to reach creative agreements in negotiations without an apparent ZOPA. We also demonstrated that in this kind of negotiation, simply identifying additional issues or proposing packaging offers were not enough; negotiators need to do both to construct creative agreements.

In this comparative case study, we analyzed two social media conflicts between farmers and animal right advocates to understand how conflicts establish, escalate, and return dormant through issue and identity framing and the discursive use of emotions. The results show that the two groups used the same set of frames throughout the three phases. We identify this as a symmetric conflict framing repertoire. The groups both use a dominant moral frame (animal welfare is of absolute value), but express distinct views on policy solutions. This triggers a contestation of credibility (who knows best and who cares most for animals) in which the two groups use the same set of issue and identity frames to directly oppose each other. The binary opposition is initially established through issue framing but escalates into an identity conflict that involves group labeling and blaming. The discursive use of emotion reinforces this escalation in two ways. First, it reinforces a vicious cycle in the contestation of credibility: While emotions are implicitly used to frame oneself as caring and trustworthy, emotion is explicitly used to frame the other party as deceptive and irrational. Second, disputants use collective emotions as a response to the other group’s offensive actions (blaming) and as a justification of one’s own collective actions. We discuss how this conflict differs from previously studied conflicts to provide plausible explanations for these findings. © 2020 International Association for Conflict Management and Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","animal husbandry; animal welfare; conflict; emotion; framing; identity; social media",,,,,,,,,,"Bar-Tal, D., Halperin, E., de Rivera, J., Collective emotions in conflict situations: Societal implications (2007) Journal of Social Issues, 63, pp. 441-460. , https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1540-4560.2007.00518.x; Beierle, T.C., Using social goals to evaluate public participation in environmental decisions (2005) Review of Policy Research, 16 (3-4), pp. 75-103. , https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1541-1338.1999.tb00879.x; Bennett, W.L., Segerberg, A., The logic of connective action: Digital media and the personalization of contentious politics (2011) Information, Communication & Society, 15, pp. 739-768. , https://doi.org/10.1080/1369118X.2012.670661; Bodtker, A.M., Katz Jameson, J., Collective emotions in conflict situations: Societal implications (2001) International Journal of Conflict Management, 12 (3), pp. 259-275. , https://doi.org/10.1108/eb022858; Bösch, R., Conflict escalation (2017) Oxford Research Encyclopedia of International Studies, 1 (April), pp. 1-25. , https://doi.org/10.1093/acrefore/9780190846626.013.82; Brady, W.J., Wills, J.A., Jost, J.T., Tucker, J.A., van Bavel, J.J., Emotion shapes the diffusion of moralized content in social networks (2017) Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 114, pp. 7313-7318. , https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1618923114; Bramsen, I., Poder, P., Theorizing three basic emotional dynamics of conflicts: A situational research agenda (2014) Peace Research, 46 (2), pp. 51-86. , https://search-proquestcom.ezproxy.ub.gu.se/docview/1795938452/fulltextPDF/23230AB686834200PQ/1?accountxml:id=11162; Brummans, B.H.J.M., Putnam, L., Gray, B., Hanke, R., Lewicki, R.J., Wiethoff, C., Making sense of intractable multiparty conflict: A study of framing in four environmental disputes (2008) Communication Monographs, 75 (1), pp. 25-51. , https://doi.org/10.1080/03637750801952735; Buijs, A., Lawrence, A., Emotional conflicts in rational forestry: Towards a research agenda for understanding emotions in environmental conflicts (2013) Forest Policy and Economics, 33, pp. 104-111. , https://doi.org/10.1016/j.forpol.2012.09.002; Cloke, K., (2013) The dance of opposites: Explorations in mediation, dialogue and conflict resolution systems design, , Dallas, TX, Goodmedia Communications; Coleman, P., Conflict, complexity, and change: A meta-framework for addressing protracted, intractable conflicts–III (2006) Peace and Conflict: Journal of Peace Psychology, 12, pp. 325-348. , https://doi.org/10.1207/s15327949pac1204_3; Coleman, P., Vallacher, R., Nowak, A., Bue Ngoc, L., Intractable conflict as an attractor: Presenting a dynamical model of conflict, escalation, and intractability (2005) SSRN Electronic Journal, pp. 1454-1475. , https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.734963; Davis, C.B., Lewicki, R.J., Environmental conflict resolution: Framing and intractability – An introduction (2003) Environmental Practice, 5 (3), pp. 200-206. , https://doi.org/10.1017/S1466046603035580; De Dreu, C.K.W., McCusker, C., Gain-loss frames and cooperation in two-person social dilemmas: A transformational analysis (1997) Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 72, pp. 1093-1106. , https://doi.org/10.1037/0022-3514.72.5.1093; De Weerd, M., Klandermans, B., Group identification and political protest: Farmers’ protest in the Netherlands (1999) European Journal of Social Psychology, 29, pp. 1073-1095. , https://doi.org/10.1002/(SICI)1099-0992(199912)29:8<1073:AID-EJSP986>3.0.CO;2-K; Del Vicario, M., Bessi, A., Zollo, F., Petroni, F., Scala, A., Caldarelli, G., The spreading of misinformation online (2016) Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 113, pp. 554-559. , https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1517441113; Dewulf, A., Gray, B., Putnam, L., Lewicki, R.J., Aarts, N., Bouwen, R., Disentangling approaches to framing in conflict and negotiation research: A meta-paradigmatic perspective (2009) Human Relations, 62 (2), pp. 155-193. , https://doi.org/10.1177/0018726708100356; Edwards, D., Emotion discourse (1999) Culture & Psychology, 5 (3), pp. 271-291. , https://doi.org/10.1177/1354067X9953001; Elliott, M., Kaufman, S., (2003) Building civic capacity to resolve environmental conflicts.

Rubin Award recipient (2006). Lisa is the author or co-author of over 125 path-breaking publications that span the fields of dispute resolution, negotiation, conflict management, public administration, public policy, law, philosophy, and organizational studies, among many others. She the consummate example of “thinking DaVinci” —using lateral thinking, moving fluidly across contexts and perspectives, taking knowledge from one context and applying it to another, and fostering creativity and innovation in scholarship. This article focuses on Lisa's contributions in the areas of mandatory arbitration and the effects of mediation, justice, and justness in alternative dispute resolution and public participation, and collaborative public management. In addition, we highlight Lisa's impact outside the United States. We give Lisa the last word where she analyzes gaps in research and practice, as well as the future of the field. © 2018 International Association for Conflict Management and Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","ADR; arbitration; Collaboration; conflict resolution; mediation; public participation",,,,,,,,,,"Agranoff, R., McGuire, M., (2003) Collaborative public management: New strategies for local government, , Washington, DC, Georgetown University Press; Amsler, L.B., Local government: The legal framework and context for voice (2013) Making public participation legal, pp. 27-30. , (Ed.),, Washington, DC, National Civic League; Amsler, L.B., Combating structural bias in dispute system designs that use arbitration: Transparency, the universal sanitizer (2014) Yearbook on Arbitration & Mediation, 6, pp. 32-55; Amsler, L.B., The evolution of social norms in conflict resolution (2014) Journal of Natural Resources Policy Research, 6 (4), pp. 285-290. , https://doi.org/10.1080/19390459.2014.947837; Amsler, L.B., Collaborative governance: Integrating management, politics, and law (2016) Public Administration Review, 76 (5), pp. 700-711. , https://doi.org/10.1111/puar.12605; Amsler, L.B., Huggins, M., Moore, S., Stout, M., Willis, W., A model state public participation act and a model municipal public participation ordinance (2013) Making public participation legal, pp. 13-20. , (Ed.),, Washington, DC, National Civic League; Amsler, L.B., Martinez, J.K., Smith, S.E., Christina Merchant and the state of dispute system design (2015) Conflict Resolution Quarterly, 33 (S1), pp. S7-S26. , https://doi.org/10.1002/crq.21149; Amsler, L.B., Martinez, J.K., Smith, S.E., Dispute system design: Preventing, managing, and resolving conflict, , (forthcoming)., Menlo Park, CA, Stanford University Press; Amsler, L.B., Nabatchi, T., Public engagement and decision-making: Moving Minnesota forward to dialogue and deliberation (2016) Mitchell Hamline Law Review, 43, pp. 1629-1681; Anderson, J.F., Bingham, L., Upstream effects from mediation of workplace disputes: Some preliminary evidence from the USPS (1997) Labor Law Journal, 48, pp. 601-615; Arnstein, S.R., A ladder of citizen participation (1969) Journal of the American Institute of Planners, 35, pp. 216-224; (2009) An examination of the arbitration fairness act of 2009, , October 28)., Columbus, GA, ACR; Avgar, A.C., Colvin, A.J., (2016) Conflict management: Critical perspectives on business and management, , (Eds.)

We propose that this research itself is gendered because negotiation research has traditionally focused on masculine negotiation contexts. In the current study, we replicate the gender effect in initiating negotiations (favoring men) and provide an empirically based selection of “masculine,” “feminine,” and “neutral” negotiation contexts, which can be used for future negotiation research. We show that the negotiation context shapes gender differences such that in specific social contexts, women tend to have even higher initiation intentions compared to men. Negotiation contexts generally seem to differ regarding their affordance to negotiate. We offer a possible explanation for gender effects on initiation intentions by uncovering the mediating role of expectancy considerations across all negotiation contexts, especially in masculine contexts, and instrumentality considerations in specific masculine and feminine contexts. © 2019 International Association for Conflict Management and Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","context; expectancy; gender; initiation of negotiation; instrumentality",,,,,,"Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG: SFB 768",,,,"Aloni, G., Desivilya, H.S., Eve's emancipation or lingering subordination to Adam?

On the basis of survey data from the construction industry, this study explores the impact of interorganizational task conflict on relationship quality and the mediating role of relational behavior. The empirical results reveal that task conflict affects relationship quality (including satisfaction, trust, and commitment) negatively. Relational behavior has three dimensions: flexibility, information exchange, and solidarity. Information exchange partially mediates the effect of task conflict on satisfaction, trust, and commitment; solidarity plays a partial mediating role in the impact of task conflict on trust and commitment; and flexibility only mediates the impact of task conflict on satisfaction partially. Relational behavior in accordance with relational norms can partially account for the impact of interorganizational task conflict on relationship quality. This paper also provides practical guidance for construction practitioners. © 2019 International Association for Conflict Management and Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","construction project; relational behavior; relational norms; relationship quality; task conflict",,,,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC: 71572124

The authors derive theory and hypotheses from relational norms that govern relationships (communal and exchange) which impact negotiators' expectations when interacting with close others. The study focuses on the influence of the negotiator's role (buyer or seller) and relational norms on expected offers. The authors tested the hypotheses across three studies. Results consistently show that close relationships influence expectations such that buyers expect more favorable offers from best friends than from friends and acquaintances (Studies 1–3). And this effect is absent for sellers (Study 1). Moreover, the motivation to meet the needs of the other party (communal strength) is higher for close relationships but it does not moderate the effect of relationships on expectations (Study 2). Finally, negotiators high in communal strength and exchange orientation norms expect more generous offers from best friends (Study 3). © 2018 International Association for Conflict Management and Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","communal norms; exchange norms; expectations; negotiation; offers; relationships",,,,,,,,,,"Adler, P.S., Kwon, S.W., Social capital: Prospects for a new concept (2002) Academy of Management Review, 27 (1), pp. 17-40. , https://doi.org/10.5465/amr.2002.5922314; Amanatullah, E.T., Morris, M.W., Curhan, J.R., Negotiators who give too much: Unmitigated communion, relational anxieties, and economic costs in distributive and integrative bargaining (2008) Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 95, p. 723. , https://doi.org/10.1037/a0012612; Barry, B., Oliver, R.L., Affect in dyadic negotiation: A model and propositions (1996) Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes, 67 (2), pp. 127-143. , https://doi.org/10.1006/obhd.1996.0069; Batson, C.D., Communal and exchange relationships: What is the difference?

Using the university campus as a context for our research, we conducted a facilitated idea generation workshop in which participants identified a set of dialogic competencies, followed by individual interviews in which we explored participants’ perceptions of the relationships among these competencies. Interviews were conducted utilizing a software-assisted, idea-structuring methodology referred to as Interpretive Structural Modeling (ISM). Based on our results, we constructed a framework that depicts the overall flow of influence among the set of dialogic competencies identified by the participants. While findings confirm the importance placed in current literature on factors such as listening and empathy, they provide a more sophisticated and nuanced perspective on how to accomplish one of the oft-stated goals of intercultural dialogue, which is to help participants examine their unconscious biases, prejudices, and privileges. © 2019 International Association for Conflict Management and Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","dialogue; empathy; inclusion; intercultural communication; intercultural competence; reflexivity",,,,,,,,,,"Abu-Nimer, M., Conflict resolution, culture, and religion: Toward a training model of interreligious peacebuilding (2001) Journal of Peace Research, 38, pp. 685-704; Abu-Nimer, M., Welty, E., Khoury, A.I., (2007) Unity in diversity: Interfaith dialogue in the middle east, , Washington, DC, United States Institute of Peace Press; Adair, W.L., Go-go global: Teaching what we know of culture and the negotiation dance (2008) Negotiation and Conflict Management Research, 1, pp. 353-370. , https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1750-4716.2008.00021.x; Adair, W.L., Taylor, M.S., Tinsley, C.H., Starting out on the right foot: Negotiation schemas when cultures collide (2009) Negotiation and Conflict Management Research, 2 (2), pp. 138-163. , https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1750-4716.2009.00034.x; Adler, N.J., Aycan, Z., Cross-cultural interaction: What we know and what we need to know (2018) Annual Review of Organizational Psychology and Organizational Behavior, 5, pp. 307-333. , https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-orgpsych-032117-104528; Agne, R., Tracy, K., Conversation, dialogue, and discourse (2009) 21st century communication: A reference handbook, pp. 177-186. , W.

Data were collected from 34 intercultural dyads, 32 American dyads, and 35 Chinese dyads that completed job offer negotiations. Results showed substantial contextual variations in the actor and partner effects of PD values. Whereas Chinese employees’ PD values positively influenced American managers’ priority information exchange, American employees’ PD values had a negative partner effect on it. Whereas Chinese employees’ PD values negatively influenced Chinese managers’ relationship building, American employees’ PD values had a positive partner effect on it. American managers and employees both used significantly fewer integrative tactics and more distributive tactics in intercultural than intracultural negotiations, but neither Chinese managers nor Chinese employees exhibited behavioral difference. Theoretical and practical implications of the study are discussed. © 2018 International Association for Conflict Management and Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","intercultural negotiation; negotiation behavior; power distance; status",,,,,,,,,,"Adair, W.L., Brett, J.M., The negotiation dance: Time, culture, and behavioral sequences in negotiation (2005) Organization Science, 16, pp. 33-51. , https://doi.org/10.1287/orsc.1040.0102; Adair, W., Brett, J., Lempereur, A., Okumura, T., Shikhirev, P., Tinsley, C., Culture and negotiation strategy (2004) Negotiation Journal, 20, pp. 87-111. , https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1571-9979.2004.00008.x; Adair, W.L., Okumura, T., Brett, J.M., Negotiation behaviors when cultures collide: The U.S. and Japan (2001) Journal of Applied Psychology, 86, pp. 371-385. , https://doi.org/I0.1037//0021-90I0.86.3.371; Adair, W.L., Taylor, M.S., Tinsley, C.H., Starting out on the right foot: Negotiation schemas when cultures collide (2009) Negotiation and Conflict Management Research, 2, pp. 138-163. , https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1750-4716.2009.00034.x; Adler, N., Graham, J., Cross-cultural interaction: The international comparison fallacy?

Ingroup favoritism, outgroup rejection, political oppression, legal discrimination, and communication bullying are all less prevalent among Northerners than among Southerners in the Northern Hemisphere, but more prevalent among Northerners than among Southerners in the Southern Hemisphere. These findings provide a rich source for further research into how social conflicts are habitually experienced and handled by residents of northern versus southern habitats. A supplementary analysis specifies the extent to which ecological stressors—thermal stress, hydraulic stress, pathogenic stress, and subsistence stress—help explain why there are oppositely sloping north–south gradients of conflict culture above and below the equator. Taken in total, these results demonstrate the importance of considering latitude in forming a deeper understanding of conflict management and negotiation. © 2018 International Association for Conflict Management and Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","biogeography; climato-economic; conflict culture; Northerners; pathogen prevalence; Southerners",,,,,,,,,,"Andersen, P.A., Lustig, M.W., Andersen, J.F., Changes in latitude, changes in attitude: The relationship between climate and interpersonal communication predictions (1990) Communication Quarterly, 38, pp. 291-311; Anderson, C.A., Bushman, B.J., Human aggression (2002) Annual Review of Psychology, 53, pp. 27-51. , https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev.psych.53.100901.135231; Arat, Z.F., (1991) Democracy and human rights in developing countries, , Boulder, CO, Lynne Rienner; Aslani, S., Ramirez-Marin, J., Brett, J., Yao, J.J., Semnani-Azad, Z., Zhang, Z.X., Dignity, face, and honor cultures: A study of negotiation strategy and outcomes in three cultures (2016) Journal of Organizational Behavior, 37, pp. 1178-1201. , https://doi.org/10.1002/job.2095; Ayoko, O.B., Ashkanasy, N.M., Jehn, K.A., (2014) Handbook of conflict management research, , (Eds.)

In-depth qualitative interviews were conducted with 14 participants: six Chinese managers and eight PNG employees. The findings show that primary orientation elements of face and power distance and situational features of labor laws and family obligations shape reported conflict communication strategies. PNG employees tended to submit to managers even when they felt wrongly accused given their cultural orientations and situational constraints. To express dissent, these employees often used indirect, passive resistance strategies. Chinese managers reported using competition to resolve conflicts. The resulting conflict outcomes are distrust and dissatisfaction and have potential negative implications for intercultural relations and organizational success.

Building on an understanding of globalization in terms of cultural and subjective matters, we propose three research domains in which psychology scholars can contribute to a further understanding of our global society: (a) the effects of global contact on cognition and behavior; (b) hybridization and human agency; and (c) new forms of cooperation. In each domain, we start with a particular key tenet within the globalization or cosmopolitan literature and then develop research questions that connect human experience and human behavior with globalization.

Our agenda is organized around five questions on negotiation and conflict management, for example: How do culture and norms relate to an individual's propensity to negotiate? Or How do tightness-looseness norms explain negotiators’ reactions to norm conformity and norm violation? And three questions on communication, for example: What individual and cultural factors lead negotiators to use miscommunication as an opportunity rather than an obstacle? Or Are there cultural differences in whether and what forms of schmoozing are normative? The present paper is based on three pillars: (a) ideas provided by the think tank participants (full list on website), (b) state of the art research and (c) the authors’ perspectives. Our goal is to inspire young, as well as, established researchers to purse these research streams and increase our understanding about the influence of cultural norms. © 2019 International Association for Conflict Management and Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","communication; conflict; culture; negotiation; social norms",,,,,,,,,,"Adair, W.L., Brett, J.M., The negotiation dance: Time, culture, and behavioral sequences in negotiation (2005) Organization Science, 16, pp. 33-51. , https://doi.org/10.1287/orsc.1040.0102; Adair, W.A., Brett, J.M., Lempereur, A., Okumura, T., Shikhirev, P., Tinsley, C.H., Culture and negotiation strategy (2004) Negotiation Journal, 20, pp. 87-111. , https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1571-9979.2004.00008.x; Adair, W.L., Okumura, T., Brett, J.M., Negotiation behaviors when cultures collide: The U.S. and Japan (2001) Journal of Applied Psychology, 86, pp. 371-385. , https://doi.org/10.1037/0021-9010.86.3.371; Adair, W.L., Taylor, M.S., Tinsley, C.H., Starting out on the right foot: Negotiation schemas when cultures collide (2009) Negotiation and Conflict Management Research, 2, pp. 138-163. , https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1750-4716.2009.00034.x; Adler, N.J., Graham, J.L., Cross-cultural interaction: The international comparison fallacy?

Here we outline five questions that we hope students of intergroup conflict will undertake to research in years to come: (a) When and why do people engage in, and publicly display, blatant forms of intergroup hostility? (b) How do different moral motives shape individual behavior in intergroup conflict? (c) How do intragroup processes influence intergroup processes and vice versa? (d) How does the changing nature of “groups” influence intergroup conflict and its resolution? And (e) how will global challenges shape intergroup relations in the 21st century? Although it is unimaginable that the problem of intergroup conflict will be eradicated, we hope that addressing these questions will help us understand how to manage intergroup conflicts and their harmful consequences better. © 2019 International Association for Conflict Management and Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","intragroup processes; morality; negotiation; war and peace",,,,,,,,,,"Aaldering, H., De Dreu, C.K., Why hawks fly higher than doves: Intragroup conflict in representative negotiation (2012) Group Processes and Intergroup Relations, 15 (6), pp. 713-724. , https://doi.org/10.1177/1368430212441638; Abrams, D., Randsley de Moura, G., Marques, J.M., Hutchison, P., Innovation credit: When can leaders oppose their group's norms?

We take a modest step to provide some insights on trust and culture in the context of negotiations and envision what opportunities are ahead of us in this area. Specifically, we provide a “cognitive map” based on the collective wisdom in the extant negotiation literature and focus on raising important questions about six key culture-related issues that warrant future research: (a) the meaning of trust, (b) the effects of trust, (c) trust development, (d) trust and distrust, (e) trust repair, and (f) trust in virtual negotiations. © 2019 International Association for Conflict Management and Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","culture; distrust; negotiation; trust; trust development; trust repair",,,,,,,,,,"Adair, W.L., Behfar, K.J., Olekalns, M., Shapiro, D.L., Celebrating the work of Jeanne M.

Academics have developed a corpus of literature to explain the way negotiators operate or how they can resolve incidents successfully. Whilst research in this area has originated from various countries and addressed negotiation from a variety of perspectives, there is limited research that has focused specifically on negotiation from an Anglo-centric perspective. This article presents the findings from a detailed academic examination of negotiator experiences in England, whereby semistructured interviews were conducted with 15 negotiators from nine forces. Analysis using grounded theory revealed 12 deployment categories, situated within a recurring context involving subjects experiencing personal, emotional, or psychological crisis. These categories can be used to enhance our understanding of negotiator deployment in England and are discussed with reference to the implications for negotiator training and practice. © 2018 International Association for Conflict Management and Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","categories of hostage and crisis negotiator deployment; characteristics of hostage and crisis negotiation; crisis negotiation; hostage and crisis negotiation; police negotiation",,,,,,,,,,"Adair, W.L., Brett, J.M., The negotiation dance: Time, culture, and behavioral sequences in negotiation (2005) Organization Science, 16, pp. 33-51. , https://doi.org/10.1287/orsc.1040.0102; Adair, W.L., Brett, J.M., Lempereur, A., Okumura, T., Shikhirev, P., Tinsley, C., Culture and negotiation strategy (2004) Negotiation Journal, 20, pp. 87-111. , https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1571-9979.2004.00008.x; Alexander, D., (2011) Hostage and crisis incidents: An evidence-based analysis to inform police negotiator training provision, , http://www.sipr.ac.uk/downloads/Research_Summaries/Research_Summary_6.pdf, SIPR Research Summary 6, March 2011., Dundee, UK, The Scottish Institute for Policing Research, Retrieved from; (2011) Manual of guidance on the management, deployment and command of armed officers, , http://www.npcc.police.uk/documents/FoI%20publication/Disclosure%20Logs/Uniformed%20Operations%20FOI/2012/093%2012%20%20Att%2001%20of%201%20Management%20Command%20and%20delpyment%20of%20Firearms%20Officers.pdf, 3rd ed., London, U.K., NPIA, Retrieved from; (2011) The use of negotiators by incident commanders, , http://library.college.police.uk/docs/acpo/National-Negotiators-Briefing-Paper-Final-Locked-2011.pdf, London, U.K., NPIA, Retrieved from; Sextortion, , http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/profiles/40DhRnbN7b69gMkPqsJ1m0Q/sextortion, Retrieved from; Beune, K., Giebels, E., Taylor, P.J., Patterns of interaction in police interviews: The role of cultural dependency (2010) Criminal Justice and Behavior, 37, pp. 904-925. , https://doi.org/10.1177/0093854810369623; Boltz, F., Dudonis, K.J., Schultz, D.P., (1992) The counter-terrorism handbook: Tactics, procedures and techniques, , Boca Raton, FL, CRC Press; Braun, V., Clarke, V., (2013) Successful qualitative research: A practical guide for beginners, , London, U.K., Sage; Call, J.A., The hostage triad: Takers, victims and negotiators (1996) Lethal violence 2000: A sourcebook on fatal domestic, acquaintance and stranger aggression, pp. 561-588. , H.

This study offers the first application of linguistic style analysis to international multilateral diplomatic negotiations. We hypothesize that agreement in multilateral negotiations is characterized by convergence of diplomats’ linguistic styles whereas disagreement associates with divergence of linguistic styles. We test our claim using original data from the plenary sessions of the Constitutional Convention on the Future of the European Union (2002–2003). We evaluate linguistic style convergence by linguistic style matching (LSM) using the text analysis program Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC). We find that linguistic style convergence among negotiators was higher in discussions on the legal personality of the European Union that ended with agreement and lower in negotiations on the definition of qualified majority voting that ended with disagreement. This study facilitates a richer understanding of how negotiators’ language use influences negotiation dynamics in international multilateral diplomacy and encourages negotiation and conflict resolution scholars and practitioners to pay attention to how diplomats express their policy position in addition to what they say. © 2018 International Association for Conflict Management and Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","diplomacy; international politics; language style matching; Linguistic Word Inquiry and Word Count; negotiation",,,,,,,,,,"Albin, C., Druckman, D., Procedures matter: Justice and effectiveness in international trade negotiations (2014) European Journal of International Relations, 20, pp. 1014-1042. , https://doi.org/10.1177/1354066114523654; Aronsson, K., Jonsson, K., Linell, P., The courtroom hearing as a middle ground: Speech accommodation by lawyers and defendants (1987) Journal of Language and Social Psychology, 6 (2), pp. 99-115. , https://doi.org/10.1177/0261927X8700600202; Babcock, M.J., Ta, P.V., Ickes, W., Latent semantic similarity and language style matching in initial dyadic interactions (2014) Journal of Language and Social Psychology, 33 (1), pp. 78-88. , https://doi.org/10.1177/0261927X13499331; Bavelas, J.B., Black, A., Lemery, C.R., Jennifer, M., I show how you feel: Motor mimicry as a communicative act (1986) Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 50, pp. 322-329. , https://doi.org/10.1037/0022-3514.50.2.322; Bayram, A.B., Due deference: Cosmopolitan social identity and the psychology of legal obligation (2017) International Organization, 71 (S1), pp. S137-S163. , https://doi.org/10.1017/S0020818316000485; Bercovitch, J., Mediation in international conflict: An overview of theory, a review of practice (1997) Peacemaking in international conflict: Methods and techniques, pp. 125-154. , I.

Findings include that local ES are more likely to play the roles as leaders, organizers of farmers, and as agents of government. Nonlocal ES are more likely to play the roles as information providers and as pure self-interest pursuers. This study also reveals that, although their knowledge and information are important, knowledge and information are only preconditions for ES's participation. Their social capital–rather than the knowledge and information they possess–differentiates the effectiveness of their participation in governance and the facilitation of community conflict resolution. Local ES with high social capital are more effective in governance and facilitating community conflict resolution than nonlocal ES without high social capital. © 2018 International Association for Conflict Management and Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","case study; community conflict resolution; cross-culture; experts; scholars; trust chain",,,,,,"National Office for Philosophy and Social Sciences, NSSFC: 14ZDB143

Mort's theorizing progressed from cooperation and competition to trust to conflict resolution to distributive justice, and finally to oppression. As a researcher, Mort was remarkably creative and innovative. His ability to think of ways to study experimentally complex social phenomena created a revolution in social psychology research. Mort's theories and research is being used to understand the nature of effective leadership and organization functioning in business and industry in Asia and other parts of the world. The strong cross-cultural validation of Mort's theorizing and research is unusual in the social sciences. Finally, Mort's cooperation and competition theory operationalizes the dynamics between cooperative and competitive processes in a variety of species and accounts for the mechanisms (e.g., goal structures) that underlie different evolutionary processes. © 2018 International Association for Conflict Management and Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","asian business and industry; conflict of interests; cooperation-competition; cross-species applications; distributive justice; trust",,,,,,,,,,"Axelrod, R., (1984) The evolution of cooperation, , New York, Basic Books; Cords, M., Aureli, F., Reconciliation and relationship qualities (2000) Natural conflict resolution, pp. 177-198. , F.

Yet, questions remain about people’s attitudes toward restorative processes such as victim–offender conferences (VOCs) and the factors that influence those attitudes. This study examined whether beliefs about youth and adult redeemability and decision-making competence influence perceptions of justice outcomes, VOC effectiveness, VOC appropriateness, VOC support, and VOC participation willingness. Analysis of survey data gathered from 207 participants through Amazon MTurk suggests that perceived redeemability and to a lesser extent decision-making competence significantly shape outcome- and process-related beliefs and evaluations. Namely, the more people believe that offenders are redeemable, the more they are likely to support restorative outcomes, perceive VOCs to be effective and appropriate, support the use of VOCs, and be willing to participate in a VOC. The study’s findings are useful for potentially shaping people’s understanding of and support for RJ. © 2019 International Association of Conflict Management and Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","decision-making competence; redeemability; restorative justice; stereotypes",,,,,,,,,,"Adair, W.L., Taylor, M.S., Tinsley, C.H., Starting out on the right foot: Negotiation schemas when cultures collide (2009) Negotiation and Conflict Management Research, 2, pp. 138-163. , https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1750-4716.2009.00034.x; Ahlin, E.M., Gibbs, J.C., Kavanaugh, P.R., Lee, J., Support for restorative justice in a Sample of U.S. university students (2017) International Journal of Offender Therapy and Comparative Criminology, 61, pp. 229-245. , https://doi.org/10.1177/0306624X15596386; Armour, M.P., Umbreit, M.S., Victim forgiveness in restorative justice dialogue (2006) Victim and Offenders, 1, pp. 123-140. , https://doi.org/10.1080/15564880600626080; Bazemore, G., Leip, L., Victim participation in the new juvenile court: Judicial attitudes toward restorative justice reforms (2000) Justice System Journal, 21, pp. 199-226. , https://doi.org/10.1080/23277556.2000.10871282; Bazemore, G., Walgrave, L., Restorative justice: In search of fundamentals (1999) Restorative juvenile justice: Repairing the harm of youth crime, pp. 45-74. , G.

Research on property rights, territoriality, and social dilemmas suggests that to reduce such conflict, organizations could facilitate the psychological privatization of commons resources. We introduce a model that helps understand how psychologically privatizing organizational commons resources—to prevent the overuse problem of the tragedy of the commons (Hardin, G. Science, 162, 1968, 1243)—can lead to the emergence of another resource dilemma. We develop a model that illustrates how resource complexity and group complexity increase psychological marking and defending behaviors. These behaviors potentially lead to a problem of resource underuse—a tragedy of the anticommons (Heller, M. A. Harvard Law Review, 111, 1998, 621)—in organizational settings.

By applying readiness theory to two case studies of mediated negotiations which ended in agreement in Aceh (2005) and Sudan (2005), this study illustrates the value of the readiness strand as an integrative analytical framework for examining the negotiation process from prenegotiation to negotiation and agreement. This type of multicausal and dynamic analysis, which considers gradual changes in the variables throughout the process, offers insights for researchers as well as for practitioners. © 2019 International Association for Conflict Management and Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","mediation; negotiation; prenegotiation; readiness",,,,,,,,,,"Aguswandi, Large, J., Delivering peace for Aceh: An interview with President Martti Ahtisaari (2008) Accord: reconfiguring politics: The Indonesia-Aceh Peace Process 20, pp. 22-24. , https://rc-services-assets.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/s3fs-public/Reconfiguring_politics_the_Indonesia_Aceh_peace_process_Accord_Issue_20.pdf, &, Aguswandi, J.

Indeed, a reading of the racial diversity literature would lead one to make one of two contradictory predictions regarding the effects of racial diversity in groups. In the interest of solving this theoretical issue, both perspectives were synthesized, such that racially diverse groups were expected to outperform homogeneous groups when performing a decision-making task, but only when relationship conflict between members was minimized. In addition, the association between racial diversity and decision-making quality was expected to be negative when relationship conflict between members was high. A study is reported which investigates the validity of and finds general support for this proposition (i.e., racial diversity in groups increased the group’s ability to make accurate decisions, but only under conditions in which relationship conflict between group members was kept to a minimum). A discussion is offered in which the implications of these results are entertained. © 2019 International Association for Conflict Management and Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","ethnicity; group decision-making; racial diversity; relationship conflict",,,,,,,,,,"Ai, C., Norton, E.C., Interaction terms in logit and probit models (2003) Economic Letters, 80 (1), pp. 123-129. , https://doi.org/10.1016/s0165-1765(03)00032-6; Antonio, A.L., Chang, M.J., Hakuta, K., Kenny, D.A., Levin, S., Milem, J.F., Effects of racial diversity on complex thinking in college students (2004) Psychological Science, 15 (8), pp. 507-510. , https://doi.org/10.1111/j.0956-7976.2004.00710.x; Bell, S.T., Deep-level composition variables as predictors of team performance: A meta-analysis (2007) Journal of Applied Psychology, 92 (3), pp. 595-615. , https://doi.org/10.1037/0021-9010.92.3.595; Bell, S.T., Villado, A.J., Lukasik, M.A., Belau, L., Briggs, A.L., Getting specific about demographic diversity variable and team performance relationships: A meta-analysis (2011) Journal of Management, 37 (3), pp. 709-743. , https://doi.org/10.1177/0149206310365001; Berscheid, E., Walster, E., (1978) Interpersonal attraction, , Reading, MA, Addison-Wesley; Blau, P.M., (1977) Inequality and composition: A primitive theory of social structure, , New York, NY, Free Press; Byrne, B., (1971) The attraction paradigm, , New York, NY, Academic Press; Cohen, J., Cohen, P., West, S.G., Aiken, L.S., (2013) Applied multiple regression/correlation analysis for the behavioral sciences, , New York, NY, Routledge; Cruz, M.G., Boster, F.J., Rodriguez, J.I., The impact of group size and proportion of shared information on the exchange and integration of information in groups (1997) Communication Research, 24 (3), pp. 291-313. , https://doi.org/10.1177/009365097024003004; De Dreu, C.K.W., Weingart, L.R., Task versus relationship conflict, team effectiveness, and team member satisfaction: A meta-analysis (2003) Journal of Applied Psychology, 88 (4), pp. 741-749. , https://doi.org/10.1037/0021-9010.88.4.741; De Wit, F.R.C., Greer, L.L., Jehn, K.A., The paradox of intragroup conflict: A meta-analysis (2012) Journal of Applied Psychology, 97 (2), pp. 360-390. , https://doi.org/10.1037/a0024844; Driskell, J.E., Goodwin, G.F., Salas, E., O’Shea, P.G., What makes a good team player?

Little is known, however, about the divergent psychological experiences of agents and principals in negotiations and their potential downstream consequences. The current research investigated how one’s role in a negotiation (as a principal or an agent) affects feelings of control, and how these feelings determine subjective value. In Studies 1 and 2, participants were randomly assigned to role-play principals or agents in deal-making negotiations. In both studies, agents reported feeling more control than principals, and control positively predicted the subjective value derived from the negotiation. In Studies 3 and 4, experimentally enhancing feelings of control influenced subjective value for principals. These findings point to the potential psychological costs of using agents. The findings advance research on subjective value in negotiations and highlight the critical role of control in principal–agent relationships. © 2019 International Association for Conflict Management and Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","agents; control; negotiation; principals; subjective value",,,,,,,,,,"Aaldering, H., Greer, L.L., Van Kleef, G.A., De Dreu, C.K., Interest (mis) alignments in representative negotiations: Do pro-social agents fuel or reduce inter-group conflict?

Both engaging and avoiding have a push and a pull. If we knew where avoiders go, we could study the pull of avoidance. This is a descriptive study (N = 446) of interpersonal conflict. We found that physical and mental avoidance appeared with similar frequency, and that they could occur in combination. People often recognized their need for avoidance early, based on the topic being familiar or various signals of trouble. Avoidance during the conflict could be physical or mental, but notably involved false agreement or topic manipulation. The possibility of violence (physical, verbal, or emotional) was often relevant. Relationship worries frequently motivated the avoidance. After the avoidance rumination was common, often centering on what we called “festering anger.”. © 2019 International Association for Conflict Management and Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","avoidance; interpersonal conflict; relational communication; rumination",,,,,,,,,,"Afifi, T.D., Olson, L., The chilling effect in families and the pressure to conceal secrets (2005) Communication Monographs, 72, pp. 192-216. , https://doi.org/10.1080/03637750500111906; Antonioni, D., Relationship between the big five personality factors and conflict management styles (1998) International Journal of Conflict Management, 9, pp. 336-355. , https://doi.org/10.1108/eb022814; Baxter, L.A., Wilmot, W.W., Taboo topics in close relationships (1985) Journal of Social and Personal Relationships, 2, pp. 253-269. , https://doi.org/10.1177/0265407585023002; Bevan, J.L., Dyadic perceptions of goals, conflict strategies, and perceived resolvability in serial arguments (2014) Journal of Social and Personal Relationships, 31, pp. 773-795. , https://doi.org/10.1177/0265407513504653; Bevan, J.L., Hefner, V., Love, A., An exploration of topics, conflict styles, and rumination in romantic nonserial and serial arguments (2014) Southern Communication Journal, 79, pp. 347-360. , https://doi.org/10.1080/1041794x.2014.918645; Boardman, S.K., Horowitz, S.V., Constructive conflict management and social problems: An introduction (1994) Journal of social issues, 50, pp. 1-12. , https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1540-4560.1994.tb02394.x; Brockner, J., Ackerman, G., Greenberg, J., Gelfand, M.J., Francesco, A.M., Chen, Z.X., Shapiro, D., Culture and procedural justice: The influence of power distance on reactions to voice (2001) Journal of Experimental Social Psychology, 37, pp. 300-315. , https://doi.org/10.1006/jesp.2000.1451; Caughlin, J.P., The demand/withdraw pattern of communication as a predictor of marital satisfaction over time: Unresolved issues and future directions (2002) Human Communication Research, 28, pp. 49-85. , https://doi.org/10.1093/hcr/28.1.49; Caughlin, J.P., Vangelisti, A.L., An individual difference explanation of why married couples engage in the demand/withdraw pattern of conflict (2000) Journal of Social and Personal Relationships, 17, pp. 523-551. , https://doi.org/10.1177/0265407500174004; Cloven, D.H., Roloff, M.E., The chilling effect of aggressive potential on the expression of complaints in intimate relationships (1993) Communications Monographs, 60, pp. 199-219. , https://doi.org/10.1080/03637759309376309; Dailey, R.M., Palomares, N.A., Strategic topic avoidance: An investigation of topic avoidance frequency, strategies used, and relational correlates (2004) Communication Monographs, 71, pp. 471-496. , https://doi.org/10.1080/0363452042000307443; Dallinger, J.M., Hample, D., Personalizing and managing conflict (1995) International Journal of Conflict Management, 6, pp. 273-289. , https://doi.org/10.1108/eb022766; Gottman, J.M., The roles of conflict engagement, escalation, and avoidance in marital interaction: A longitudinal view of five types of couples (1993) Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology, 61, pp. 6-15. , https://doi.org/10.1037/0022-006X.61.1.6; Hample, D., (2005) Arguing: Exchanging reasons face to face, , Mahwah, NJ, Lawrence Erlbaum Associates; Hample, D., (2018) Interpersonal arguing, , New York, MY, Peter Lang; Hample, D., Benoit, P.J., Must arguments be explicit and violent: A study of naive social actors’ understandings (1999) Proceedings of the fourth international conference of the International Society for the Study of Argumentation, pp. 306-310. , F.

However, gender differences should be amplified in masculine contexts (with even more inconsistency between the negotiator role and the feminine gender role) and reduced in feminine contexts (with more consistency between the negotiator role and the feminine gender role). We showed in Study 1 (N = 1,306 students) that negotiators’ expectancies about being successful in negotiations mediated the effect of gender on real retrospective negotiation behavior. In Study 2, an online scenario experiment (N = 167 students and employees), we found that the framing of the negotiation context (feminine vs. masculine) moderated the mediation effect.

Blake, who received the Lifetime Achievement Award in 1994 from the International Association for Conflict Management for his pioneering work and prolific career in the field of conflict management. As a longtime co-author and collaborator, Dr. Jane S. Mouton certainly would have been joint recipient of this award if it were not for her death in 1987: The vast majority of their research was published together. Jane Mouton and Robert Blake became famous for their promotion of the Managerial Leadership Grid and through their work as consultants to a variety of professions and organizations. But there is much more to Robert Blake's career and contributions than the Grid. Together, Blake and Mouton were tremendously influential in their work on managerial leadership and organizational development. © 2019 International Association for Conflict Management and Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Jane Mouton; managerial grid; organizational leadership; Robert Blake",,,,,,,,,,"Blake, R.R., (1941) The development of opinions regarding the differences between Negroes and Whites, , (Unpublished master's thesis)., University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA; Blake, R.R., (1947) Ocular activity during the administration of the Rorschach Test, , (Unpublished doctoral dissertation)., The University of Texas, Austin, TX; Blake, R.R., The fruits of professional interdependence for enriching a career (1992) Management laureates: A collection of autobiographical essays, pp. 106-165. , A.

To extend this recognition of David, Negotiation and Conflict Management Research invited us to publish this tribute. We begin with Dean Tjosvold's discussion of David's career. Daniel Druckman describes David's research on constructive controversy and team performance. Roger Johnson outlines how David and he laid the foundations of cooperative learning. Karl Smith describes the development of intellectual disagreement to promote decision-making. Cary Roseth shows the persistence and skill needed for David's meta-analyses on the effects of cooperation and competition on learning. Finally, David responds to three questions developed by the contributors. © 2019 International Association for Conflict Management and Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","constructive controversy; cooperative learning; Rubin award; social interdependence; theory and practice",,,,,,,,,,"Cronbach, L.J., Prudent aspirations for social inquiry (1982) The social sciences: Their nature and uses, pp. 61-81. , W.

Drawing on conservation of resources and psychological ownership theory, this article investigates the mediating role of employee cynicism on the relationship between tolerance to workplace incivility and outcome variables (i.e., service innovative behavior, knowledge hiding behavior, and job search behavior) in the hospitality industry. Structural equation modeling and artificial neural network were applied on survey data obtained from five-star hotels in Jordan. Building on the proposed theories, we show that employee cynicism mediates the link between tolerance to workplace incivility and knowledge hiding behavior, and job search behavior.

We tested whether and how robustly they do with three distinct studies, run with three distinct populations. Simultaneous mediation analyses generally, but not completely, confirmed our expectations. In Study 1, only competitiveness mediated sex differences in unethical negotiation tactics among Chilean business students. Although empathy also explained willingness to use unethical negotiation tactics, the Chilean men and women did not differ in this regard. In Study 2, competitiveness and empathy both mediated sex differences in American business students’ intentions to lie to a client, but competitiveness explained greater variance. In Study 3, both factors explained sex differences in lying to bargaining partners for real stakes by working-age Americans. Our findings suggest that competitiveness and empathy each explain sex differences in willingness to use unethical tactics, but the former does so more consistently. © 2018 International Association for Conflict Management and Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","ethical decision making; gender; negotiations; sex differences",,,,,,"ComisiÃ³n Nacional de InvestigaciÃ³n CientÃ­fica y TecnolÃ³gica, CONICYT

It suggests a move from conflict resolution to conflict engagement in these cases; this entails preparing the ground for formal negotiation within a wider and prior strategic negotiation (SN) framework. We outline a strategic negotiation (SN) approach that aims to supplement existing theoretical and practical approaches in cases that have yet to gain sufficient traction. This new perspective is grounded in the prenegotiation literature, but adds another layer by addressing the circumstances in which conflict parties are not even prepared to undertake the preliminary moves that prenegotiation requires. We suggest how an SN approach might be helpful as an extension and supplement to ripeness theory in the most difficult cases. © 2018 International Association for Conflict Management and Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","kerry; negotiations; ripeness; strategic negotiation",,,,,,,,,,"Ben-Artzi, R., Cristal, M., Kopelman, S., Conceptualizing conflict management and conflict resolution as distinct negotiation processes in the context of the enduring Israeli-Palestinian conflict (2015) Negotiation and Conflict Management Research, 8 (1), pp. 56-63. , https://doi.org/10.1111/ncmr.12046; Birnbaum, B., Tibon, A., (2014) The Explosive, Inside Story of How John Kerry Built an Israel-Palestine Peace Plan – and Watched It Crumble, , http://www.newrepublic.com/article/118751/how-israel-palestine-peace-deal-died, July 20)., New Republic, Retrieved from; Brom, S., (2014) The American Principles Document: The Negotiations with Israel and the Palestinians, (515). , http://heb.inss.org.il/index.aspx?id=4354&articleid=6593, Retrieved from, (Hebrew); Casperson, N., (2017) Peace agreements: Finding solutions to intra-state conflicts, , Cambridge, UK, Polity; Cohen, R., (2017) The One-State Two-State Blues, p. 28. , February 16)., The Times, p; Crocker, C.A., Hampson, F.O., Aall, P., Introduction: Mapping the nettle field (2005) Grasping the nettle: Analyzing cases of intractable conflict, pp. 3-32. , C.

First, a move away from viewing conflict as dysfunctional to viewing it as constructive. Second, a shift from normative prescriptions to descriptions of what disputants do in conflict. Third, a shift from psychological functional analyses to studying conflict as an organizational phenomenon. We find that three distinct and essentially contested conceptions frame studies of conflict at work: conflict as a distinct behavioral phenomenon, conflict as an instrumental means of achieving something else, and conflict as a social construction contingent on how reality is perceived. This conceptual essay adds to current thinking in organizational conflict research by emphasizing how philosophical and political assumptions about conflict can be seen to have framed knowledge production within the field when it is viewed historically. © 2018 International Association for Conflict Management and Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","conflict management; organizational conflict; philosophy of science; theorizing",,,,,,,,,,"Amason, A., Distinguishing the effects of functional and dysfunctional conflict on strategic decision making: Resolving a paradox for top management teams (1996) Academy of Management Journal, 39 (1), pp. 123-148. , https://doi.org/10.2307/256633; Antonioni, D., Relationship between the big five personality factors and conflict management styles (1998) International journal of conflict management, 9, pp. 336-355. , https://doi.org/10.1108/eb022814; Aquino, K., Structural and individual determinants of workplace victimization: The effects of hierarchical status and conflict management style (2000) Journal of Management, 26 (2), pp. 171-193. , https://doi.org/10.1177/014920630002600201; Aritzeta, A., Ayestaran, S., Swailes, S., Team role preference and conflict management styles (2005) International Journal of conflict management, 16 (2), pp. 157-182. , https://doi.org/10.1108/eb022927; Barki, H., Hartwick, J., Conceptualizing the construct of interpersonal conflict (2004) International Journal of Conflict Management, 15, pp. 216-244. , https://doi.org/10.1108/eb022913; Barley, S., Contextualising conflict: Notes on the anthropology of disputes and negotiations (1991) Research on negotiation in organizations: Handbook of negotiation research, 3, pp. 165-199. , R.

Studies on informal and voluntary third party interventions by peers or someone else in a nonhierarchical position are very limited. The aim of this systematic review is to investigate empirical studies on peacemaking to (a) define the concept; (b) search for scales that measure peacemaking; (c) and identify outcomes of peacemaking. In total, our search led to 713 unique hits of which 12 were retained based on the predefined selection criteria. Based on the findings from the reviewed articles, we propose a definition of peacemaking and identify four components of peacemaking: relational, procedural, emotional, and content help. This study contributes to the current conflict management literature by focusing on informal and voluntary helping behavior in the context of conflicts (instead of formal interventions), while linking the literature on organizational citizenship behavior and research on third party interventions in the context of conflict. In practice, peacemakers play a crucial role in solving conflicts constructively and contribute as such to both individual and team functioning. © 2018 International Association for Conflict Management and Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","OCB; peacemaking; third party intervention; workplace conflict",,,,,,"China Scholarship Council, CSC",,,,"Alberts, J.K., Heisterkamp, B.L., McPhee, R.M., Disputant perceptions of and satisfaction with a community mediation program (2005) International Journal of Conflict Management, 16 (3), pp. 218-244. , https://doi.org/10.1108/eb022930; Alper, S., Tjosvold, D., Law, K.S., Conflict management, efficacy, and performance in organizational teams (2000) Personnel Psychology, 53, pp. 625-642. , https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1744-6570.2000.tb00216.x; Arnold, J.A., The influence of the need for closure on managerial third-party dispute intervention (2007) Journal of Managerial Psychology, 22, pp. 496-505. , https://doi.org/10.1108/02683940710757218; Arnold, J.A., O'Connor, K.M., Ombudspersons or peers?

Inconsistent findings in the literature suggest that additional factors impact these relationships. In this study, we integrate theories of conflict, affect, and attribution within the domain of decision-making to gain a greater understanding of how and why organizational conflicts are at times positive, negative, or neutral. Specifically, we posit that the conclusions individuals reach as a result of their attributions, and their subsequent emotions and behavioral responses, play a significant role in determining conflict's effects. We apply theories of team-level emotional convergence to propose how the individual emotional responses of team members may converge into a collective emotional response at the team level. Finally, we propose that the team-level emotional responses initiated by the attribution process are significant moderators of the relationship between conflict type and decision outcomes. © 2018 International Association for Conflict Management and Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","attributions; conflict; decision-making; emotions",,,,,,,,,,"Abramson, L.Y., Seligman, M.E.P., Teasdale, J.D., Learned helplessness in humans: Critique and reformulation (1978) Journal of Abnormal Psychology, 87 (1), pp. 49-74. , https://doi.org/10.1037/0021-843X.87.1.49; Aldrich, N.J., Tenenbaum, H.R., Sadness, anger, and frustration: Gendered patterns in early adolescents’ and their parents’ emotion talk (2006) Sex Roles, 55, pp. 775-785. , https://doi.org/10.1007/s11199-006-9131-y; Allred, K.G., Anger and retaliation: Toward an understanding of impassioned conflict in organizations (1999) Research on negotiations in organizations, 7, pp. 27-58. , https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=0%2C44&q=Anger+and+retaliation%3A+Toward+an+understanding+of+impassioned+conflict+in+organizations&btnG=, R.

Surdna Foundation","In addition to placing me in the classroom and getting me to my first academic conference, Trish hired me to work on the Comprehensive Peer Mediation Evaluation Project funded by the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation (1995) and the Surdna Foundation (1995). This project, which compared conflict education and peer mediation programs in four states from elementary through high school, introduced me to the complexities of research coordination, survey design, data collection, data entry, and data analysis. Trish always knew which projects were a good fit for my skills and interests, as I coordinated a local conference on mediation in higher education, participated in mediation training for Temple University ombudspersons, and studied the implementation and dissemination of our own peer mediation program, the Conflict Education Resource Team (CERT) that Ross will describe further below. All of these opportunities sowed the seeds for a career in engaged research as Trish modeled how to build partnerships with on-and off-campus organizations to make her research as robust and relevant as possible while always bringing the results into practice.",,,"Allen, B., Broome, B., Jones, T.S., Chen, V., Collier, M.J., Intercultural Alliances: a cyber-dialogue between scholar-practitioners (2003) Intercultural alliances: critical transformation, pp. 279-320. , https://doi.org/10.4135/9781452233154, In, M.J.

Rubin Theory-To-Practice Award from the International Association for Conflict Management (IACM), we celebrate Linda Babcock's contributions to diverse lines of research, her tireless and effective efforts to put the insights of her research into practice, and at a personal level, the impact she has had on each of our lives. Innovative ideas and novel methods have been the hallmarks of Linda's research on diverse topics: the impact of self-serving conceptions of fairness on negotiations, the labor supply behavior of cab drivers, the impact of damage caps on settlements, the propensity of men and women to initiate negotiations, and the readiness of each gender to volunteer for, and work on, “nonpromotable tasks.” Linda won this award, however, not only for her path-breaking academic research, but for her interest in and ability to convert it into actionable initiatives. From founding the Program for Research and Outreach on Gender Equity in Society (PROGRESS), whose mission is to develop tools to teach women and girls how to harness the power of negotiation, to her leadership of the Carnegie Mellon Leadership and Negotiation Academy for Women, Linda shows how academics can play a leading role in translating theory into practice. © 2018 International Association for Conflict Management and Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","gender and nonpromotable tasks; gender in negotiations; negotiations; self-serving bias",,,,,,,,,,"Amanatullah, E.T., Morris, M.W., Negotiating gender roles: Gender differences in assertive negotiating are mediated by women's fear of backlash and attenuated when negotiating on behalf of others (2010) Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 98 (2), pp. 256-267. , https://doi.org/10.1037/a0017094; Amanatullah, E.T., Tinsley, C.H., Punishing female negotiators for asserting too much or not enough: Exploring why advocacy moderates backlash against assertive female negotiators (2012) Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes, 120 (1), pp. 110-122. , https://doi.org/10.1016/j.obhdp.2012.03.006; Artz, B., Goodall, A., Oswald, A.J., (2016) Do women ask?, , IZA Discussion Papers; Babcock, L., What happens when women don't ask (2008) Negotiation, 11 (96), pp. 1-4; Babcock, L., (2008) Women, repeat this: Don't ask, don't get, , New York Times, BU19; Babcock, L., Benedict, M.E., Engberg, J., Pittsburgh labor market adjustments in the 1980s: Who gained and who lost?

His work in Cyprus was supported by the Cyprus Fulbright Commission (Daniel Hadjitoffi, Director) and the United Nations Office of Project Services (UNOPS).","Ben’s applied communication research also includes a wealth of “translational” scholarship, in which he both embraces the practitioner role and makes his research accessible and usable to other practitioners, communities with which he works, and members of the general public. He has, for instance, conducted numerous workshops (e.g., on group design) and written many research reports for a wide variety of organizations and audiences around the world, from Oklahomans for Indian Opportunity, to the (U.S.) National Association of Social Workers, to Turkey’s European Union Observatory, to the United Nations Office of Project Services (see Figure 5). Moreover, some of his applied communication scholarship never has been or will be reported, because some communities with which he works (e.g., some Native Americans tribes) want their work to remain confidential.","the development of a new national well-being measurement framework in collaboration with the Central Statistics Office in Ireland; (b) the design of early intervention projects in collaboration with the World Health Organization (WHO) Healthy Cities group in Galway, Ireland; and (c) facilitation work supporting the Public Participation Network (PPN) in Galway City, to highlight the importance of well-being in local government project work.","Boulding, E., Image and action in peace building (1988) Journal of Social Issues, 44, pp. 17-37. , https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1540-4560.1988.tb02061.x; Boulding, E., Boulding, K., (1995) The future: Images and processes, , London, UK, Sage; Boulding, J.R., Clements, K.P., Morrison, M.L., Yodsampa, A.S., Elise Boulding's legacy to the twenty-first century: Reflections on her contributions to understanding conflict and peace (2016) Negotiation and Conflict Management Research, 9, pp. 274-291. , https://doi.org/10.1111/ncmr.12078; Broome, B.J., Foundations of struggles and Gconflicts in reek interpersonal communication (1990) Southern Communication Journal, 55, pp. 260-275. , https://doi.org/10/1080/10411794009372794; Broome, B.J., Bridging the gulf between two realities: Personal reflection and essay (1991) International Journal of Intercultural Relations, 15, pp. 323-326. , https://doi.org/10.10167/0147-1767(97)90005-2; Broome, B.J., The role of empathy in interpersonal communication (1991) Understanding relationships: Selected readings in interpersonal communication, pp. 201-217. , In, B.

In reviewing this work, we recognize Barbara's lifelong concern for social justice and environmental sustainability, her pioneering use of qualitative methods, and her ongoing commitment to the development of young scholars. © 2018 International Association for Conflict Management and Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","conflict management; environmental conflict; framing; multiparty negotiations; power and status; social justice",,,,,,,,,,"Abdalla, C.W., Becker, J., Hanke, R., Cook-Hoffman, C., Gray, B., Welsh, N., Community conflicts over intensive livestock operations: How and why do such conflicts escalate?

We compare group-chosen and assigned leaders and explore their resulting influence upon the group process and outcome in a social dilemma context. In three empirical studies, we predict and provide support for the idea that group-chosen leaders will attend more to the social aspects of the group's interaction as opposed to the economic (bottom-line) ones than will assigned leaders. Additionally, we found that those groups with group-chosen leaders had more overall group cooperation (i.e., less economic self-interest), greater trust in one another and in the leader, and had leaders who displayed more socially oriented leadership behaviors. © 2017 International Association for Conflict Management and Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","cooperation; ethics; groups; leadership; social dilemmas; trust",,,,,,,,,,"Avolio, B.J., Walumbwa, F.O., Weber, T.J., Leadership: Current theories, research, and future directions (2009) Annual Review of Psychology, 60, pp. 421-449. , https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev.psych.60.110707.163621; Bass, B.M., (1990) Bass and Stogdill's handbook of leadership: Theory, research, and managerial applications, , 3rd ed., New York, NY, Free Pres; Bass, B.M., (1998) Transformational leadership: Industrial, military, and educational impact, , Hillsdale, NJ, Erlbau; Black, J.S., Gregersen, H.B., Participative decision making: An integration of multiple dimensions (1997) Human Relations, 50, pp. 859-878. , https://doi.org/10.1177/001872679705000705; Cohen, M.A., Dienhart, J., Moral and amoral conceptions of trust, with an application in organizational ethics (2011) Journal of Business Ethics, 112, pp. 1-13. , https://doi.org/10.1007/s10551-012-1218-5; Cummings, L.L., Bromiley, P., The organizational trust inventory (OTI): Development and validation (1996) Trust in organizations: Frontiers of theory and research, pp. 302-330. , In, R.

Study 1 asked the respondents to complete a questionnaire based on a recalled multi-round negotiation, and 169 samples were valid. In Study 2, 205 participants totally filled out the questionnaire after a simulated negotiation. Both results point out as follows: (a) relationship SV positively relates to all five negotiation styles, and its relationship with integrating, compromising, obliging, and avoiding styles is strongest among four branches of SV; (b) process SV is only positively related to integrating; (c) instrumental SV negatively relates to uncooperative styles—avoiding and dominating—and the relationship with dominating style is strongest; (d) self-SV relates to both integrating and dominating which looks like incompatible.

Our accounts illustrate Dan's teaching philosophy as teaching by doing, his long-lasting passion for pragmatic, evidence-based analysis; his innovative application of research methods; and his international outreach. Each narrated experience demonstrates how Dan's holistic understanding of scholarship and his creative teaching, science, and practice have influenced the next generations of scholars. These accounts are integrated with a systematic analysis of Dan's publications to display his persistence in pushing the boundaries of the field by synthesizing variables, building theories, and bridging micro-level interactions to the broader political environment.

Use of graphic novels in classrooms has proven effective in facilitating learning for students, as a conduit for lifelong reading, a tool for increased comprehension and critical literacy, and a stimulus for interest and comprehension. In applying this to teaching negotiation and conflict management, graphic novels may be effective in engaging students and increasing understanding when terms and concepts are confusing or vague, especially in their differences, and can help students understand the process and outcome of negotiation, both objective and subjective. It is in this way that the use of graphic novels in teaching negotiation and conflict management links to the nexus of research, theory, practice, and pedagogy.

The following article aims to answer this question by investigating how, and why, an organization's negotiation capability should be developed. We propose a four-level Organizational Model of Negotiation (OMoN), in which the individual level (I) concerns how people interact at the negotiation table; the linkages level (II) concerns how different negotiations impact one another; the infrastructure level (III) concerns how an organization may organize its negotiation functions; and finally, the capability level (IV) concerns how negotiation can be the source of competitive advantage. Our framework opens the path for developing the understanding of this issue by presenting teaching resources and identifying a possible theoretical underpinning. The article also presents a broad research agenda, which offers the basis for future studies to integrate concepts from different fields of research, such as from the management and strategy literature, into the field of negotiation. © 2017 International Association for Conflict Management and Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","capability; management; negotiation; negotiation infrastructure; Organizational Model of Negotiation (OMoN); strategy",,,,,,,,,,"Ackermann, F., Eden, C., Negotiation in strategy making teams: Group support systems and the process of cognitive change (2011) Group Decision and Negotiation, 20 (3), pp. 293-314. , https://doi.org/10.1007/s10726-008-9133-y; Amason, A.C., Distinguishing the effects of functional and dysfunctional conflict on strategic decision making: Resolving a paradox for top management teams (1996) Academy of Management Journal, 39 (1), pp. 123-148. , https://doi.org/10.2307/256633; Amason, A.C., Schweiger, D.M., The effects of conflict on strategic decision making effectiveness and organizational (1997) Using conflict in organizations, p. 101. , (p., London, UK, Sage; Anderson, C.R., Zeithaml, C.P., Stage of the product life cycle, business strategy, and business performance (1984) Academy of Management Journal, 27 (1), pp. 5-24. , https://doi.org/10.2307/255954; Appelt, K.C., Higgins, E.T., My way: How strategic preferences vary by negotiator role and regulatory focus (2010) Journal of Experimental Social Psychology, 46, pp. 1138-1142. , https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jesp.2010.05.010; Behfar, K., Friedman, R., Brett, J., Managing co-occurring conflicts in teams (2016) Group Decision and Negotiation, 25, pp. 501-536. , https://doi.org/10.1007/s10726-015-9450-x; Borbély, A., Agency in conflict resolution as a Manager-Lawyer Issue: Theory and implications for research (2011) Negotiation and Conflict Management Research, 4 (2), pp. 129-144. , https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1750-4716.2011.00076.x; Borbély, A., Negotiations, Ryanair-Style (2014) Case #314-293-1, The Case Centre, Cranfield, UK; Bottom, W.P., Studt, A., Framing effects and the distributive aspect of integrative bargaining (1993) Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes, 56, p. 459. , https://doi.org/10.1006/obhd.1993.1064; Bradbury-Huang, H., What is good action research?

We challenge this conceptual dichotomy through the qualitative analysis of negotiation accounts by practitioners and graduate students. Drawing on self-worth theory, we reexamine the delineation and contrast of dignity and honor cultures as they manifest in negotiations between French and Latin American people. According to our set of interviews and written narratives, negotiators on the two sides share a large set of perceptions of French negotiating behavior, coalescing into three main components—conventionality, pride in historical legacy, and conflict proneness. This French behavior falls into neither cultural category, but rather demonstrates the possibility of hybrids between them. We discuss implications for theory, practice, and teaching of cross-cultural understanding, and, specifically, of the French negotiating style. © 2017 International Association for Conflict Management and Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","case study; cross-cultural negotiations; dignity culture; French negotiation; honor culture; qualitative research",,,,,,,,,,"Adair, W.L., Taylor, M.S., Tinsley, C.H., Starting out on the right foot: Negotiation schemas when cultures collide (2009) Negotiation and Conflict Management Research, 2, pp. 138-163. , https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1750-4716.2009.00034.x; Aslani, S., Ramirez-Marin, J., Brett, J., Yao, J., Semnani-Azad, Z., Zhang, Z.-X., Dignity, face, and honor cultures: A study of negotiation strategy and outcomes in three cultures (2016) Journal of Organizational Behavior, 37, pp. 1178-1201. , https://doi.org/10.1002/job.2095; Aslani, S., Ramirez-Marin, J., Semnani-Azad, Z., Brett, J.M., Tinsley, C., Dignity, face, and honor cultures: Implications for negotiation and conflict management (2015) Handbook of research on negotiation, pp. 249-282. , In, M.

While there might be an implicit understanding that such integration is key to advancing the field, we make this explicit. Highlighting the critical aspects of this relationship, we call for a four-dimensional approach to writing in the negotiation and conflict management field. We suggest that adopting such systematic and intentional exploration of all four dimensions should be the default approach to writing on negotiation and conflict management topics. We provide brief summaries of the articles presented in the special issue and discuss the essence, origins, and weighting of the four dimensions in each paper. Finally, we suggest that this four-dimensional approach might have ramifications for the field's work, in areas other than writing. © 2017 International Association for Conflict Management and Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","ADR; conflict; conflict management; conflict resolution; integration; negotiation; pedagogy; practice; research; teaching; theory",,,,,,,,,,"Azar, E.E., Burton, J.W., (1986) International conflict resolution: Theory and practice, , (Eds.)

While there is widespread agreement on the prominent role negotiation plays in education, in the workplace, in public policy, and in other fields, there remains a lack of consensus on pedagogies and teaching models that effectively train students and practitioners in the various aspects of negotiation, ranging from pre-intervention assessment, to effective bargaining, dialogue, and facilitation, to evaluating procedural and distributive outcomes. In order to synthesize distinct disciplinary approaches and skill/content areas into an integrated pedagogical model, this article describes a negotiation simulation designed to incorporate skill building, process management, conflict analysis, and conflict management tools. The model incorporates equal emphasis on theoretical frameworks and understanding, self-awareness training for facilitators, social network and stakeholder analysis for negotiation preparation, participatory analytical and discursive process management, and developing metrics for monitoring, evaluation and impact assessment. © 2017 International Association for Conflict Management and Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","complex systems and sustainable peace; environment and public resources; negotiation processes",,,,,,,,,,"Andrews-Speed, P., Bleischwitz, R., Boersma, T., Johnson, C., Kemp, G., VanDeveer, S.D., (2012) The global resource nexus: The struggles for land, energy, food, water and minerals., , http://www.transatlanticacademy.org/sites/default/files/publications/TA%202012%20report_web_version.pdf, Transatlantic Academy, Retrieved from; Balint, P.J., Stewart, R.E., Desai, A., Walters, L.C., (2011) Wicked environmental problems: Managing uncertainty and conflict, , Washington, DC, Island Press; Brown, O., Hauptfleish, M., Jallow, H., Tarr, P., Environmental assessment as a tool for peacebuilding and development: Initial lessons from capacity building in Sierra Leone (2012) Assessing and restoring natural resources in post-conflict peacebuilding, pp. 327-342. , https://environmentalpeacebuilding.org/assets/Documents/LibraryItem_000_Doc_076.pdf, In, D.

But theory and practice often exist in separate worlds, each vying for privilege and recognition. However, many scholars and practitioners work in the theory–practice nexus, constantly negotiating as they move back and forth between the two domains. But even though tensions often exist between theory and practice, this essay proposes that they function together is a symbiotic relationship. Several ways are proposed for how a symbiotic approach to theory and research can be beneficial for the study and practice of conflict management, and the benefits of doing so are outlined. It is proposed that theory and practice come together in special ways in the classroom, and scholars and practitioners are encouraged to consider possibilities for promoting through teaching and pedagogy the coevolution of knowledge that is the essence of symbiosis. © 2017 International Association for Conflict Management and Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","collaborative inquiry; knowledge coproduction; reflective scholar; symbiosis; theory-practice nexus",,,,,,,,,,"Abu-Nimer, M., (2001) Reconciliation, justice, and coexistence: Theory and practice, , (Ed.)

In this conceptual review, we argue for the utility and importance of adopting a communication perspective (Pearce, 1989, Communication and the human condition. Southern Illinois University Press, Carbondale, IL.) for defining, evaluating, and practicing restorative justice. We begin by describing a communication perspective before reviewing scholarly literature regarding defining and evaluating restorative justice. We also illustrate how a communication perspective can prompt useful questions about defining, evaluating, facilitating, and administering restorative justice. We conclude with a discussion of implications for research, facilitation, and organizational administration. © 2017 International Association for Conflict Management and Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","assessment; communication; conflict; restorative justice",,,,,,,,,,"Acton, E., Restorative justice a postcode lottery?

I discuss the known antecedents of anger in negotiation, as well as its positive and negative inter- and intrapersonal effects. I pay particular attention to the apparent disagreements within the literature concerning the benefits and drawbacks of using anger to gain advantage in negotiations and employ Attribution Theory as a unifying mechanism to help explain these diverse findings.

The first section describes various common understandings of this shift in the context of Jewish-Arab relations in Israel. Section two will describe the underpinnings of the paradigm shift from individualistic to relational understanding of the self and argue that this shift is consistent with the wish for transition to “shared society” and to develop more dialogic frameworks of groups’ shared living. Section three will present a case study, the work of Givat Haviva, emphasizing the relational premises that can be found in its methodology to cultivate a shared society among Jews and Arabs in Israel. © 2017 International Association for Conflict Management and Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","dialogue; relational peacebuilding; shared society",,,,,,,,,,"Abu-Nimer, M., (1999) Dialogue, conflict resolution, and change: Arab-Jewish encounters in Israel, , NY, Springer; Abu-Nimer, M., (2001) Reconciliation, justice and coexistence: Theory and practice, , Lanham, MD, Lexington Books; Abu-Nimer, M., Coexistence and Arab-Jewish encounters in Israel: Potential and challenges (2004) Journal of Social Issues, 60, pp. 404-422. , https://doi.org/10.1111/j.0022-4537.2004.00121.x; Amir, Y., Contact hypothesis in ethnic relations (1969) Psychological Bulletin, 71, pp. 319-343. , https://doi.org/10.1037/h0027352; Amir, Y., The role of intergroup contact in change of prejudice and ethnic relations (1976) Toward the elimination of racism, , In, P.

In this article, we review the theoretical and empirical research on emotions and deception in negotiation and introduce a theoretical model. In our review of the research, we find that emotions profoundly influence the decision to use deception. We also find that although negotiation is inherently interpersonal, theoretical and empirical research on deception has focused on the intrapersonal effects of emotion. For this reason, we integrate theory and research on the interpersonal effects of emotions into research on deception and propose a model—the Interpersonal Emotion Deception Model—that relates the emotions of a counterpart to the deception decisions of a negotiator. Our review and model expands our understanding of the important role of emotions in the deception decision process and provides a theoretical foundation for future research in the intrapersonal and interpersonal perspectives. © 2017 International Association for Conflict Management and Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","deception; emotions; ethics; negotiation; trust",,,,,,,,,,"Adler, R.S., Rosen, B., Silverstein, E.M., Emotions in negotiation: How to manage fear and anger (1998) Negotiation Journal, 14, pp. 161-179. , https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1571-9979.1998.tb00156.x; Akerlof, G.A., The market for “lemons”: Quality uncertainty and the market mechanism (1970) The Quarterly Journal of Economics, 84, pp. 488-500; Algoe, S.B., Haidt, J., Gable, S.L., Beyond reciprocity: Gratitude and relationships in everyday life (2008) Emotion, 8, pp. 425-429. , https://doi.org/10.1037/1528-3542.8.3.425; Allred, K.G., Anger and retaliation: Toward an understanding of impassioned conflict in organizations (1999) Research on Negotiation in Organizations, 7, pp. 27-58; Allred, K.G., Mallozzi, J.S., Matsui, F., Raia, C.P., The influence of anger and compassion on negotiation performance (1997) Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes, 70, pp. 175-187. , https://doi.org/10.1006/obhd.1997.2705; Andrade, E.B., Ho, T.H., Gaming emotions in social interactions (2009) Journal of Consumer Research, 36, pp. 539-552. , https://doi.org/10.1086/599221; (2006) Highlights: Workplace stress & anxiety Disorders Survey, , http://www.adaa.org/workplace-stress-anxiety-disorders-survey, Retrieved from; Arnold, J.A., O'Connor, K.M., How negotiator self-efficacy drives decisions to pursue mediation (2006) Journal of Applied Social Psychology, 36, pp. 2649-2669. , https://doi.org/10.1111/j.0021-9029.2006.00121.x; Averill, J.R., Studies on anger and aggression: Implications for theories of emotion (1983) American Psychologist, 38, pp. 1145-1160. , http://doi.org/10.1037/0003-066X.38.11.1145; Baron, R.A., Fortin, S.P., Frei, R.L., Hauver, L.A., Shack, M.L., Reducing organizational conflict: The role of socially-induced positive affect (1990) International Journal of Conflict Management, 1 (2), pp. 133-152. , https://doi.org/10.1108/eb022677; Barry, B., The tactical use of emotion in negotiation (1999) Research on Negotiation in Organizations, 7, pp. 93-121; Barry, B., Fulmer, I.S., Goates, N., Bargaining with feeling: Emotionality in and around negotiation (2006) Negotiation theory and research, pp. 99-127. , In, L.

However, emerging social functional perspectives on workplace anger suggest that anger expressions can promote valued dialogue, facilitating the airing of differences that can lead to improved working relationship and movement toward organizational goals and beneficial change. While supervisors typically express work-related anger with impunity, subordinate anger may be challenged and sanctioned more frequently. Hypotheses tested status (supervisor vs. subordinate) and role (expresser vs. target) effects on perceived outcomes. Findings indicate a significant main effect for status and significant interaction with role such that subordinates who are targets of supervisor anger, reported significantly more negative outcomes from anger expression than any other type of anger interaction. We also found that existing strong relationships between supervisors and subordinates contribute to outcomes that are more favorable following anger expressions at work. © 2017 International Association for Conflict Management and Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","conflict management; emotions; power; status",,,,,,,,,,"Allcorn, S., (1994) Anger in the workplace: Understanding the causes of aggression and violence, , Westport, CT, Quorum; Anderson, P.A., Guerrero, L.K., (1998) Principles of communication and emotion in social interaction, , New York, NY, Academic Press; Andersson, L.M., Pearson, C.M., Tit for tat?

Across three experiments, we propose that group identification is a cause and consequence of self-labeling with stigmatizing group labels, a practice known to reduce stigma. Experiment 1 found that group identification increased self-labeling with a stigmatizing group label. In Experiment 2, individuals who self-labeled with a stigmatizing group label felt more identified with their group, which reduced the label's perceived negativity; they also persisted longer on an in-group helping task, an effect that was partially mediated by group identification. In Experiment 3, observers perceived self-labelers as more identified with their group and as viewing the label less negatively; perceived group identification mediated the relationship. Group identification is a critical component in reappropriating stigmatizing labels and provides insight into how highly identified members can navigate group conflict by negotiating their group's identity. © 2017 International Association for Conflict Management and Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","diversity; identity; intergroup conflict; stigma",,,,,,,,,,"Allen, I., (1983) The language of ethnic conflict: Social organization and lexical culture, , New York, NY, Columbia University Press; Allen, V., Wilder, D.A., Atkinson, M.L., Multiple group membership and social identity (1983) Studies in social identity, pp. 92-115. , In, T.

To manage these conflicts, employee representatives (ERs) often participate in organizational decision-making. The objectives of this article were to investigate the relation between perceived competences of ERs and their influence on organizational decision-making in different types of issues, and the mediating effect of ERs’ conflict behaviors on these relations. To test the hypotheses, which are based on theories of power and conglomerate conflict behavior, survey data from 614 human resources directors from 11 European countries were analyzed using structural equation modeling. Results show that perceived competences are positively related to the influence of ERs on decision-making, both for traditional and for innovative issues. Perceived competence is positively related to cooperative and negatively related to competitive conflict behavior. Conglomerate conflict behavior partly mediates the relation between perceived competences and influence. Implications for representative influence are discussed. © 2017 International Association for Conflict Management and Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","competencies; conglomerate conflict behavior; employee representatives; influence; power",,,,,,,,,,"Aaldering, H., De Dreu, C.K., Why hawks fly higher than doves: Intragroup conflict in representative negotiation (2012) Group Processes & Intergroup Relations, 15, pp. 713-724; Addison, J.T., The determinants of firm performance: Unions, works councils, and employee involvement/high performance work practices (2005) Scottish Journal of Political Economy, 52, pp. 406-450; Anderson, C., Brion, S., Perspectives on power in organizations (2014) Annual Review of Organizational Psychology and Organizational Behavior, 1 (1), pp. 67-97; Arbuckle, J.L., (2014) Amos 23.0 User's Guide, , Chicago, IL, IBM SPSS; Bandura, A., Self-efficacy: Toward a unifying theory of behavioral change (1977) Psychological Review, 84 (2), pp. 191-215; Bollen, K., Euwema, M., The role of hierarchy in face-to-face and e-supported mediations: The use of an online intake to balance the influence of hierarchy (2013) Negotiation and Conflict Management Research, 6, pp. 305-319; Bryson, A., Forth, J., George, A., (2012) Workplace social dialogue in Europe: An analysis of the European Company Survey 2009, , Eurofound; Carnevale, P., Pruitt, D., Negotiation and mediation (1992) Annual Review of Psychology, 43 (1), pp. 531-582; Cialdini, R.B., Goldstein, N.J., Social influence: Compliance and conformity (2004) Annual Review of Psychology, 55, pp. 591-621; Conchon, A., National participation rights in an EU perspective: The SE rules as a key safeguard (2013) A decade of experience with the European Company, pp. 291-309. , In, J.

In three experiments, we demonstrate that perceptions of partner sociability, morality, and competence are significantly influenced by emotional expressions and are important predictors of trust. Specifically, we show that in zero-acquaintance interactions, displays of happiness increase, but displays of anger decrease stereotypes of sociability, morality, and competence. Happiness expressions are also conducive to trust, whereas expressions of anger are detrimental to trust. We further demonstrate that expressions of ambivalence do not affect perceptions of sociability, but decrease perceptions of morality and competence. Overall, expressions of ambivalence have a negative effect on partner trust. Perceptions of morality consistently explain the effect of expressed happiness, anger, and ambivalence on initial trust across the three experiments and different bargaining contexts. Implications for research on emotions and trust in negotiations are discussed. © 2017 International Association for Conflict Management and Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","emotional displays; stereotypes; trust; zero-acquaintance",,,,,,,,,,"Adam, H., Brett, J.M., Context matters: The social effects of anger in cooperative, balanced, and competitive negotiation situations (2015) Journal of Experimental Social Psychology, 61, pp. 44-58. , #x0026;; Ames, D.R., Johar, G.V., I'll know what you're like when I see how you feel: How and when affective displays influence behavior-based impressions (2009) Psychological Science, 20, pp. 586-593. , #x0026;; Anderson, C., Thompson, L.L., Affect from the top down: How powerful individuals’ positive affect shapes negotiations (2004) Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes, 95, pp. 125-139. , #x0026;; Barrett, L.F., Mesquita, B., Gendron, M., Context in emotion perception (2011) Current Directions in Psychological Science, 20, pp. 286-290. , #x0026;; Bartel, C.A., Saavedra, R., The collective construction of workgroup moods (2000) Administrative Science Quarterly, 45, pp. 197-231. , #x0026;; Bazerman, M.H., Neale, M.A., (1992) Negotiating rationally, , #x0026;, New York, NY, Free Press; Belkin, L.Y., Kurtzberg, T., Affective displays in e-mail communication: The evidence from the lab and the field (2013) Research on emotions in organizations, 9, pp. 279-308. , #x0026;, In, N.

Building on a theory of the initiation of negotiation we investigated when and why people consider initiating negotiations. Results from one field study and two scenario experiments show that a negative discrepancy between an actual state and a desired state increased the intention to initiate a negotiation and promoted real initiation behavior. This effect was mediated by the subjective perception of this discrepancy and feelings of dissatisfaction. Expectancy considerations in the form of ability to initiate negotiations and implicit beliefs about negotiation ability moderated this serial mediation effect: high initiation ability and incremental negotiation beliefs facilitated the decision to negotiate whereas low initiation ability and entity negotiation beliefs inhibited negotiation initiations. In the present work, we offer a first empirical test of the theory of initiation of negotiation. © 2017 International Association for Conflict Management and Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","ability; discrepancy; implicit negotiation beliefs; initiation of negotiation; satisfaction",,,,,,,,,,"Aguinis, H., Bradley, K.J., Best practice recommendations for designing and implementing experimental vignette methodology studies (2014) Organizational Research Methods, 17, pp. 351-371. , #x0026;; Anderson, C.A., Lindsay, J.J., Bushman, B.J., Research in the psychological laboratory: Truth or triviality?

We propose that team conflict may buffer the detrimental effects of faultlines on group performance. We draw on social categorization and group process theories suggesting that the negative effects of fault-lines are due to increased competition and decreased communication across subgroups and can be diminished with cross-subgroup information exchange and elaboration. We propose that intragroup conflict in small groups will decrease negative effects of demographic faultlines because detecting conflict and engaging in conflict management require cross-subgroup communication and information elaboration. In Study 1, using student groups we found that relationship, task, and process conflict buffered the negative effect of demographic faultline strength on group performance. In Study 2, we manipulated conflict and group faultlines (ethnic faultlines vs. no faultlines) and found that group conflict buffered the negative effect of faultlines on group performance. Theoretical contributions and practical implications are discussed. © 2017 International Association for Conflict Management and Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","demographic faultlines; ethnicity; group performance; process conflict; relationship conflict; task conflict",,,,,,,,,,"Adair, W.L., Loewenstein, J., Talking it through: Communication sequences in negotiation (2013) Handbook of research on negotiation, pp. 311-331. , #x0026;, In, M.

Each of us highlights a few unique contributions from four areas of Jeanne's research: (a) getting disputes resolved (Debra Shapiro); (b) negotiating globally (Wendi Adair); (c) illuminating the shadow box of negotiation process (Mara Olekalns); and (d) managing team processes (Kristin Behfar). Together we identify common themes across these areas of Jeanne's research and invite Jeanne to reflect on future research opportunities and impart her words of wisdom to doctoral students and young scholars. © 2016 International Association for Conflict Management and Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","conflict management; culture; dispute resolution; negotiation; teams",,,,,,,,,,"Adair, W.L., Brett, J.M., The negotiation dance: Time, culture, and behavioral sequences in negotiation (2005) Organization Science, 16, pp. 33-51; Adair, W.L., Brett, J.M., Lempereur, A., Okumura, T., Shikhirev, P., Tinsley, C., Culture and negotiation strategy (2004) Negotiation Journal, 20 (1), pp. 87-111; Adair, W.L., Okumura, T., Brett, J.M., Negotiation behavior when cultures collide: the United States and Japan (2001) Journal of Applied Psychology, 86, pp. 371-385; Adair, W.L., Weingart, L., Brett, J.M., The timing and function of offers in U.S. and Japanese negotiations (2007) Journal of Applied Psychology, 92, pp. 1056-1068; Alon, I., Brett, J.M., Perceptions of time and their impact on negotiations in the Arabic-speaking Islamic world (2007) Negotiation Journal, 23 (1), pp. 55-73; Aslani, S., Ramirez-Marin, J., Brett, J.M., Yao, J., Semnani-Azad, Z., Zhang, Z., Dignity, face, and honor cultures: A study of negotiation strategy and outcomes in three cultures (2016) Journal of Organizational Behavior; Behfar, K., Kern, M., Brett, J.M., Managing challenges in multicultural teams (2006) Research on managing groups and teams: National culture and groups, 9, pp. 233-262. , #x0026;, In, Y.

We highlight her transformational impact not only on conflict research, but also on those of us who have had the opportunity to work with her. Noting her multidisciplinary research and her advocacy for a communication perspective of conflict, we review four distinct contributions and their intersections with conflict research: the communication perspective of conflict, interaction analysis, the bona fide group perspective, and bounded emotionality. Underlying these contributions are cross-disciplinary principles exemplified in Linda Putnam's research and career that serve to revitalize conflict research and inspire scholars.

Elise Boulding, the 2000 recipient of the International Association for Conflict Management (IACM) Lifetime Achievement Award Winner, made significant contributions to understanding conflict and peace as a peace activist, peace scholar, futurist, feminist, and family sociologist. She also left a lasting legacy as a networker and builder of communities of scholars and activists.

Our experimental approach involved 74 teams of five parties negotiating the details of a pilot test to compost and/or recycle used paper coffee cups. Approximately half of these negotiation teams were given a quantitative model—a life cycle assessment (LCA). We measured both negotiation process and outcome variables, in particular identifying favorable agreements—the mutually exclusive set of agreements that either minimized carbon dioxide emissions or maximized the parties’ collective earned value. We found that most teams used a quantitative model; nearly half of those cocreated their own while negotiating. In our sample, teams that used a model, even those cocreating the model while negotiating, reached agreement more quickly than teams not using a model. Teams that cocreated the LCA reached a higher number of favorable agreements. We observed two dominant manners of model use: using the model to test alternatives while developing an agreement and verifying that a tentative agreement would sufficiently reduce carbon dioxide emissions. We conclude that using a quantitative model during a sustainability negotiation can help to increase the chances of obtaining a favorable agreement without lengthening the negotiation duration. © 2016 International Association for Conflict Management and Wiley Periodicals, Inc","expert-made model; Life Cycle Assessment Model (LCA); model use; negotiator cocreated model; sustainability negotiation",,,,,,,,,,"Beall, A., Zeoli, L., Participatory modeling of endangered wildlife systems: Simulating the sage-grouse and land use in central Washington (2008) Ecological Economics, 68, pp. 24-33; Butler, J.K., Toward understanding and measuring conditions of trust: Evolution of a conditions of trust inventory (1991) Journal of Management, 17, pp. 643-663; Corrigan, S., Zon, G.D.R., Maij, A., McDonald, N., Mårtensson, L., An approach to collaborative learning and the serious game development (2015) Cognition, Technology & Work, 17, pp. 269-278; Curhan, J.R., Elfenbein, H.A., Kilduff, G.J., Getting off on the right foot: Subjective value versus economic value in predicting longitudinal job outcomes from job offer negotiations (2009) Journal of Applied Psychology, 94, pp. 524-534; Curhan, J.R., Neale, M.A., Ross, L., Dynamic valuation: Preference changes in the context of face-to-face negotiation (2004) Journal of Experimental Social Psychology, 40, pp. 142-151; Curhan, J.R., Pentland, A., Thin slices of negotiation: Predicting outcomes from conversational dynamics within the first 5 minutes (2007) Journal of Applied Psychology, 92, pp. 802-811; Czaika, E., (2010) Starbucks cups: Trash or treasure?

This article explores challenges in such settings, which we illustrate, with a case in Japan regarding the promotion of wood biomass usage through stakeholder dialogue in a small island community. Reflection from the experience reveals two challenges that are likely to occur in similar contexts: drawing the attention of stakeholders to the long-term risks to sustainability and dealing with personal relationships in a high-power-distance culture. We find that in our case and more generally stakeholders’ problem recognition related to risk must be nurtured through learning opportunities and scenario exercises in the early stages of consensus building processes. The hierarchical nature of interpersonal communication in several Asian countries, where senior participants enjoy more power in negotiation, also requires careful design of processes, particularly when long-term issues are at stake. © 2016 International Association for Conflict Management and Wiley Periodicals, Inc","consensus building; culture; Japan; power-distance; sustainability",,,,,,,,,,"Adair, W.L., Integrative sequences and negotiation outcome in same-and mixed-culture negotiations (2003) International Journal of Conflict Management, 14, pp. 273-296; Adair, W.L., Okumura, T., Brett, J.M., Negotiation behavior when cultures collide: the United States and Japan (2001) Journal of Applied Psychology, 86, p. 371; Adler, P., Brewer, J., McGee, C., (2007) The Ok Tedi negotiations: Rebalancing the equation in a chronic sustainability dilemma, , Keystone, CO, Keystone Center; Armitage, D., Berkes, F., Doubleday, N., Introduction: Moving beyond co-management (2010) Adaptive co-management: Collaboration, learning, and multi-level governance, pp. i-xiii. , In, D.

The Balfour Forest, enveloping the Israeli town of Migdal HaEmek, was ignored by the local community who viewed it as a potentially dangerous no-man's land. The Jewish National Fund (JNF), Israel's forestry agency, initiated a process to engage the Migdal HaEmek community in developing and taking responsibility for the forest and serve as a model for the development of community forests in Israel. Between 2008 and 2009, the collaborative structure was designed and established, and community activists identified, recruited, and empowered to create a team of “forest trustees” whose activities continue to impact ties among the community and the forest.

We introduce the concept of conflict detachment and examined whether this coping strategy alleviates the degree of negative emotions a person feels due to a conflict experience. Sixty-two individuals from various professions in the Netherlands provided questionnaire and daily survey measures during five consecutive workdays. Multilevel analyses showed that daily relationship and process conflict experiences at work were positively related to daily negative emotions. In addition, the results demonstrated a lagged effect of passive negative emotions: feelings of guilt and sadness predicted lower in-role and extra-role performance the following day. We also found that conflict detachment moderated the relationship between daily conflict and negative emotions. We discuss the implications of our findings for organizational practice and suggest possible ways for future research. © 2016 International Association for Conflict Management and Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Emotions; Interpersonal conflict",,,,,,,,,,"Aldao, A., Nolen-Hoeksema, S., Specificity of cognitive emotion regulation strategies: A transdiagnostic examination (2010) Behavior Research and Therapy, 48, pp. 974-983; Ashton-James, C., Ashkanasy, N., Understanding the role of affect in strategic decision contexts (2008) Research on emotions in the workplace, 5, pp. 1-34. , In C.

The Dual Threshold Model (Geddes & Callister,) argues that although these ""muted anger"" venting episodes may increase unfavorable organizational outcomes, they also may prompt participants or observers of these displays to engage in advocacy or surrogacy on behalf of an angry colleague. The research reported here empirically tests this proposition and reports that advocating on behalf of one's angry colleague can enhance individual relationships at work as well as organizational functioning. Findings also show that observer felt anger intensity is a primary motivator for prompting anger advocacy and, surprisingly, advocacy is less likely on behalf of close colleagues. © 2016 International Association for Conflict Management and Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Advocacy; Anger; Change agents; Conflict resolution; Emotional expression; Social support",,,,,,,,,,"Agresti, A., (2007) An introduction to categorical data analysis, , 2nd ed.).

Fisher College of Business, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, United States","Violations of trust are an unfortunate but common occurrence in conflict and negotiation settings: negotiators make promises that they do not keep; parties in conflict behave in unexpected ways, escalating tensions and breaking past trust. What often follows these violations is some form of an account, specifically an apology, in an effort to repair that trust. But are some apologies more effective than others? Two studies reported here examine the structural components of apologies. Six components of an apology were defined from previous research and presented to subjects-singly and in combination-in the form of component definitions and in the context of a trust violation scenario. Results indicate that not all apologies are viewed equally; apologies with more components were more effective than those with fewer components, and certain components were deemed more important than others. Moreover, apologies following competence-based trust violations were seen as more effective than apologies following integrity-based violations. Implications and future directions for research in the structure of effective apologies are presented. © 2016 International Association for Conflict Management and Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Apology; Trust repair; Trust violation",,,,,,,,,,"Baron, R.A., Countering the effects of destructive criticism: The relative efficacy of four interventions (1990) Journal of Applied Psychology, 75, p. 235. , doi.org/10.1037/0021-9010.75.3.235; Bennett, M., Earwaker, D., Victims' responses to apologies: The effects of offender responsibility and offense severity (1994) The Journal of Social Psychology, 134, pp. 457-464; Benoit, W.L., (1995) Accounts, excuses, and apologies: A theory of image restoration strategies, , Albany, NY: State University of New York Press; Benoit, W.L., (2015) Accounts, excuses, apologies: Image repair theory and research, 2ndedition, , Albany, NY: State University of New York Press; Benoit, W.L., Tenzek, K.E., Allen, M., Burrell, N., Cattopadhyay, S., Cherry, K., Evaluation of accounts: A meta-analysis (2014) Managing interpersonal conflict: Advances through meta-analysis, pp. 284-296. , In N.

Employees (N = 242) from three organizations completed a survey instrument in which they reported the types of upward dissent tactics and types of conflict management styles they used with their supervisors as well as their perceptions of the quality of those relationships. The integrating conflict management style was positively correlated with the prosocial dissent tactic and negatively correlated with the threatening resignation dissent tactic. The dominating conflict management style was positively correlated with threatening resignation, circumvention, and repetition dissent tactics. When looking at relationships between the use of upward dissent tactics, superior-subordinate relationship quality, and conflict management styles, we found that conflict management styles were a stronger predictor of the use of upward dissent tactics than superior-subordinate relationship quality.

This article focuses on workplace negotiations and examines how employees' selection of representatives depends on their level of perceived organizational support (POS). We predict and show that employees who experience high levels of POS send to the negotiation table ingroup representatives who are perceived as close to (rather than distant from) the management team. The first study establishes the effect. The second study replicates the findings and investigates the underlying mechanisms. Results show that POS impacts endorsement of pro-management representatives through an increased perception that these deviant members are typical of the employee's group. Change in perceived typicality is triggered by POS directly and via an increase in employees' organizational identification. We discuss of the positive and negative consequences for groups who send to the negotiation representatives who are close to the opposing group. © 2016 International Association for Conflict Management and Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Group deviance; Ingroup typicality; Negotiation; Organizational identification; Perceived organizational support; Representatives",,,,,,,,,,"Ashforth, B.E., Mael, F., Social identity theory and the organization (1989) Academy of Management Review, 14, pp. 20-39; Becker, T.E., Potential problems in the statistical control of variables in organizational research: A qualitative analysis with recommendations (2005) Organizational Research Methods, 8, pp. 274-289; Bentler, P.M., Bonett, D.G., Significance tests and goodness of fit in the analysis of covariance structures (1980) Psychological Bulletin, 88, pp. 588-606; Benton, A.A., Druckman, D., Constituent's bargaining orientation and intergroup negotiation (1974) Journal of Applied Social Psychology, 4, pp. 141-151; Blau, P., (1964) Exchange and power in social life, , New York, NY: Wiley; Burger, J.M., Messian, N., Patel, S., del Prado, A., Anderson, C., What a coincidence!

While previous literature focused on context-free traits such as warmth and competence, we examine how people categorize specific negotiation goals and behaviors as masculine and feminine across the United States and China in different negotiation contexts, illustrating the role of cultural and situational contexts in gender-related categorization. Two studies found that while American participants categorized competitive goals and behaviors as masculine and cooperative ones as feminine across business-to-consumer (B2C) and business-to-business (B2B) negotiation contexts, Chinese participants' patterns depended on the negotiation context. In B2C contexts, Chinese participants categorized competitive goals and behaviors as feminine and cooperative ones as masculine in B2B contexts, they made further distinctions, categorizing competitive goals and behaviors that are socially inappropriate as feminine, but competitive ones that are socially appropriate, and cooperative goals and behaviors, as masculine. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed. © 2016 International Association for Conflict Management and Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Culture; Gender; Negotiation",,,,,,,,,,"Adair, W.L., Brett, J.M., The negotiation dance: Time, culture, and behavioral sequences in negotiation (2005) Organization Science, 16, pp. 33-51; Amanatullah, E.T., Morris, M.W., Negotiating gender roles: Gender differences in assertive negotiating are mediated by women's fear of backlash and attenuated when negotiating on behalf of others (2010) Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 98, pp. 256-267; Amanatullah, E.T., Morris, M.W., Curhan, J.R., Negotiators who give too much: Unmitigated communion, relational anxieties, and economic costs in distributive and integrative bargaining (2008) Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 95, p. 723; Amanatullah, E.T., Tinsley, C.H., Ask and ye shall receive?

Subsequent media reports generated local and international interest, statements, and commentary from company and government interests and members of the La Brea community (fisherfolk and residents directly affected by the oil spill), the national community, trade unionists, politicians, oil spill experts, and environmentalists. As the news coverage developed, various narrative themes emerged. Within these themes, various conflict issues, mainly pertaining to the nature and focus of communication, and differences over the prevention, mitigation and management of environmental disasters were manifested in the media coverage and corporate communications management of crisis and reputation. Using crisis communication theory, and content analysis of media and company texts, this study examined the extent of media coverage and organizational and corporate communications framing of the creation, escalation, and management of a significant environmental conflict situation. © 2016 International Association for Conflict Management and Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Crisis communication; Environmental conflict; Framing; Media; Oil spill; Trinidad",,,,,,,,,,"Baptiste, K., Nordenstam, B.J., Villagers' response to oil and gas drilling in rural Trinidad (2010) Environment and social justice: An international perspective, pp. 289-321. , In D.

We propose that needs for support may be particularly dependent upon the experience of asymmetry between conflict parties. We distinguish between two types of asymmetry and examine how they relate to different needs for support. We hypothesized that dependence asymmetry (being more dependent on the other party than vice versa) would predict a need for problem-focused help. Conflict asymmetry (experiencing more conflict than the other side) was expected to increase the need for emotion-focused help, particularly when people have a weak social network. We tested these hypotheses with a survey among 700 legal aid clients. Results showed that dependence asymmetry was indeed a strong and positive predictor of problem-focused empowerment needs, whereas conflict asymmetry positively and significantly predicted the need for emotion-focused help, particularly in the absence of wider social support. © 2016 International Association for Conflict Management and Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Conflict asymmetry; Legal aid; Legal conflicts; Power-dependence asymmetry; Social support",,,,,,,,,,"Abbey, A., Abramis, D.J., Caplan, R.D., Effects of different sources of social support and social conflict on emotion-focused well-being (1985) Basic and Applied Social Psychology, 6, pp. 111-129; Anderson, C., Berdahl, J.L., The experience of power: Examining the effects of power on approach and inhibition tendencies (2002) Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 83, pp. 1362-1377; Beck, C.J.A., Sales, B.D., A critical reappraisal of divorce mediation research and policy (2000) Psychology, Public Policy, and Law, 6, pp. 989-1056; Bollen, K., Euwema, M., Müller, P., Why are subordinates less satisfied with mediation?

According to the literature, help-giving has various determinants such as gravity of the bullying acts and behaviors of the perpetrators and responsibility attributed to the perpetrators and to the victims often depend on behaviors. With vignettes, we examined the influence of bullying acts, victim's prosocial or antisocial behavior at work, and revictimization on equity judgments, perceived responsibility of perpetrators and victims, and help-giving. Eight vignettes of bullying at work were submitted to 205 participants. The results showed that the situation was judged less equitable, the victim less responsible, the perpetrator more responsible, and the intention of help increased (a) when the perpetrator's acts were serious and (b) when the bullied had emitted a prosocial behavior versus an antisocial one. © 2016 International Association for Conflict Management and Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Antisocial or prosocial behaviors; Bullying; Equity; Help-giving; Responsibility; Revictimization",,,,,,,,,,"Agervold, M., Gemzoe-Mikkelsen, E., Relationships between bullying, psychosocial work environment and individual stress reactions (2004) Work and Stress, 18, pp. 336-351; Baillien, E., Neyens, I., De Witte, H., De Cuyper, N., A qualitative study on the development of workplace bullying: Towards a three way model (2009) Journal of Community & Applied Social Psychology, 19, pp. 1-16; Baron, R.A., Neuman, J.H., Workplace violence and workplace aggression: Evidence on their relative frequency and potential causes (1996) Aggressive Behavior, 22, pp. 161-173; Bauman, S., Newman, M.L., Testing assumptions about cyber bullying: Perceived distress associated with acts of conventional and cyber bullying (2013) Psychology of Violence, 3, pp. 27-38; Betancourt, H., An attribution empathy model of helping behavior: Behavioral intentions and judgments of help-giving (1990) Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, 16, pp. 573-591; Bierhoff, H.-W., (2002) Prosocial behaviour, , Hove: Psychology Press; Bowling, N.A., Beehr, T.A., Workplace harassment from the victim's perspective: A theoretical model and meta-analysis (2006) Journal of Applied Psychology, 91, pp. 998-1012; Brodsky, G.M., (1976) The harassed worker, , Lexington, MA: D.C.

Data were collected from 82 research teams and team leaders, using electronic questionnaires; data on these teams' objective performance was also obtained. We found a direct influence of only task conflict on team work engagement. Moderation analysis revealed that relationship conflict weakens the relationship between team resources and team work engagement, whereas task conflict strengthens the relationship between team work engagement and team performance. Therefore, relationship conflict has a detrimental effect for the development of a positive emergent state of work engagement; on the contrary, discussing ideas positively influences the transformation of the team's level of engagement into objective performance. © 2015 International Association for Conflict Management and Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Team conflict; Team performance; Team work engagement",,,,,,,,,,"Bakker, A.B., An evidence-based model of work engagement (2011) Current Directions in Psychological Science, 20, pp. 265-269; Bakker, A.B., Albrecht, S.L., Leiter, M.P., Work engagement: Further reflections on the state of play (2011) European Journal of Work and Organizational Psychology, 20, pp. 74-88; Bakker, A.B., Demerouti, E., The Job Demands-Resources model: State of the art (2007) Journal of Managerial Psychology, 22, pp. 309-328; Bakker, A.B., Demerouti, E., Sanz-Vergel, A.I., Burnout and work engagement: The JD-R approach (2014) Annual Review of Organizational Psychology and Organizational Behavior, 1, pp. 389-411; Bakker, A.B., Hakanen, J.J., Demerouti, E., Xanthopoulou, D., Job resources boost work engagement, particularly when job demands are high (2007) Journal of Educational Psychology, 99, pp. 274-284; Bakker, A.B., Leiter M., P., Where to go from here?

In this article, we address these questions in a five-group experimental study, with direct parties to the conflict (Israeli-Jewish, Palestinian, and Guatemalan), third/secondary parties to the conflict (Turkish, American, and Brazilian), and distant parties to the conflict. Our results indicate that learning varies not only from one group to the other, but also with the salience of the conflict. While the simulations increase the level of knowledge about that particular conflict in almost all situations, when attitude change is concerned, the effects diversify from one group to the other. © 2015 International Association for Conflict Management and Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Computer games; Experimental research; Identity; Negotiation simulation",,,,,,,,,,"Alexander, N., LeBaron, M., Death of the role play (2009) Second generation negotiation teaching, 1, pp. 179-197. , In C.

With an intracultural lens, we look at how two opposing groups that share one overarching culture maximize group gains and achieve a bargaining agreement. We analysed audio recordings of collective bargaining meetings between labor and management negotiators of a multinational beverage company in the Philippines. Consistent with the claims of previous studies, negotiation between labor and management within this culture reflected low trust. Joint gains were however achieved through face dynamics that thwarted the impact of low trust bargaining. Specifically, our discursive analysis shows how utterances contain justifications, demands, rejections and threats. However, such apparently contentious talks are embedded in local language that conveys respect for authority, mixed with efforts to maintain harmony. These reflections of face culture in the bargaining process help shift the negotiations from a contentious to a collaborative and successful problem-solving process. © 2015 International Association for Conflict Management and Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Culture; Negotiation; Qualitative research; Trust",,,,,,,,,,"Adair, W.L., Brett, J.M., Culture and negotiation (2004) The handbook of negotiation and culture, pp. 158-176. , In M.

We examined the effects of attachment anxiety and avoidance on negotiation propensity and performance in two studies. In terms of negotiation propensity (Study 1), attachment anxiety had significant, deleterious effects, though contrary to our predictions, attachment avoidance did not have significant effects. However, there was an interaction such that individuals high on attachment avoidance had a greater propensity to negotiate with an insecurely attached counterpart compared to a secure counterpart. In addition, attachment orientation influenced negotiation performance and information sharing (Study 2), but the effects depended upon role in the negotiation, with stronger effects for attachment avoidance as opposed to attachment anxiety.

We report a laboratory experiment that examined the influence of social value orientation, counterpart's behavior, and power on the motive to use gossip for indirect aggression in a conflict situation. Results showed that when participants had high power, their social value orientation determined whether they were motivated to gossip to indirectly aggress toward their counterpart: Proself participants showed a higher motivation to do so than prosocial participants. In contrast, when participants had low power, the motive to engage in indirect aggression through gossip was influenced by the counterpart's behavior: Participants who encountered a competitive counterpart showed a higher motivation to aggress through gossip than participants who encountered a cooperative counterpart. © 2015 the International Association for Conflict Management and Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Experimental research; Gossip; Interpersonal conflict; Negotiation; Power",,,,,,,,,,"Adair, W., Brett, J.M., The negotiation dance: Time, culture, and behavioral sequences in negotiations (2005) Organization Science, 16, pp. 33-51; Anderson, C., Berdahl, J.L., The experience of power: Examining the effects of power on approach and inhibition tendencies (2002) Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 83, p. 1362; Anderson, C., Galinsky, A.D., Power, optimism, and risk-taking (2006) European Journal of Social Psychology, 36, pp. 511-536; Anderson, C., John, O.P., Keltner, D., The personal sense of power (2012) Journal of Personality, 80, pp. 313-344; Anderson, E., Siegel, E.H., Bliss-Moreau, E., Barrett, L.F., The visual impact of gossip (2011) Science, 332, pp. 1446-1448; Archer, J., Coyne, S.M., An integrated review of indirect, relational, and social aggression (2005) Personality and Social Psychology Review, 9, pp. 212-230; Baumeister, R.F., Zhang, L., Vohs, K.D., Gossip as cultural learning (2004) Review of General Psychology, 8, pp. 111-121; Beersma, B., De Dreu, C.K.W., Negotiation processes and outcomes in pro-socially and egoistically motivated groups (1999) International Journal of Conflict Management, 10, pp. 385-402; Beersma, B., Van Kleef, G.A., How the grapevine keeps you in line: Gossip increases contributions to the group (2011) Social Psychological and Personality Science, 2, pp. 642-649; Beersma, B., Van Kleef, G.A., Why people gossip: An empirical analysis of social motives, antecedents, and consequences (2012) Journal of Applied Social Psychology, 42, pp. 2640-2670; Björkqvist, K., Österman, K., Lagerspetz, K., Sex differences in covert aggression among adults (1994) Aggressive Behavior, 20, pp. 27-33; Brinol, P., Petty, R.E., Valle, C., Rucker, D.D., Becerra, A., The effects of message recipients' power before and after persuasion: A self-validation analysis (2007) Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 93, pp. 1040-1053; Buss, A.H., (1961) The psychology of aggression, , New York, NY: John Wiley & Sons; Chen, S., Chai, A.Y., Bargh, J.A., Relationship orientation as a moderator of the effects of social power (2001) Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 80, pp. 173-187; Clark, M.S., Mills, J., Interpersonal attraction in exchange and communal relationships (1979) Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 37, pp. 12-24; De Backer, C., Larson, C., Cosmides, L., Bonding through gossip?

In the first study, 68 production teams from eight industrial companies were surveyed. In the second study, we analyzed 77 workgroups from 14 companies. Hierarchical regression analysis was computed to test the hypotheses at the team level, and hierarchical linear modeling was conducted to test the hypotheses at the individual level. The results revealed a negative impact of task conflict on team effectiveness and a positive effect of integrating. No moderator effects were found. Our results, being similar in both studies, come out against the importance of the type of task on the relationship between conflict and team outcomes. Furthermore, our findings suggest that reducing intragroup conflict and providing team members with the abilities to manage conflict cooperatively is a way to increase group performance and team members' satisfaction. © 2015 the International Association for Conflict Management and Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Conflict; Conflict management; Team performance; Team satisfaction; Teams; Workgroups",,,,,,,,,,"Alper, A., Tjosvold, D., Law, K.S., Conflict management, efficacy and performance in organizational teams (2000) Personnel Psychology, 53, pp. 625-642; Amason, A.C., Distinguishing the effects of functional and dysfunctional conflict on strategic decision making: Resolving a paradox for top management teams (1996) Academy of Management Journal, 39, pp. 123-148; Amason, A.C., Sapienza, H.J., The effects of top management team size and interaction norms on cognitive and affective conflict (1997) Journal of Management, 23, pp. 495-516; Barki, H., Hartwick, J., Conceptualizing the construct of interpersonal conflict (2004) International Journal of Conflict Management, 15, pp. 216-244; Beaudin, G., Savoie, A., L'efficacité des equipes de travail: Définition, composantes et mesures (1995) Revue québequoise de psychologie, 16, pp. 185-201; Behfar, B., Peterson, R., Mannix, E., Trochim, W., The critical role of conflict resolution in teams: A close look at the links between conflict type, conflict management strategies, and team outcomes (2008) Journal of Applied Psychology, 93, pp. 170-188; Benítez, M., Medina, F.J., Munduate, L., El estúdio del conflicto en los equipos de trabajo.

We suggest that negotiators who differ in how dominantly they behave in the negotiation exchange information effectively because they fulfill different roles in the negotiation process. Study 1 demonstrated that dominant negotiators generally assert their desires, while relatively submissive negotiators generally ask questions to find ways to satisfy their own desires without escalating conflict with the dominant negotiators. Studies 2 and 3 demonstrated that participants were best able to discover integrative agreements when one negotiator was instructed to behave dominantly and the other negotiator, submissively.

For victims in particular, participating in a VOC ostensibly provides a way to talk directly with the offender about the harm done, hold the person accountable, and achieve restoration. Lacking, however, is an understanding of what motivates victim participation. This study investigates how the desire to obtain offender-related outcome goals, victim-related outcome goals, process goals, and information goals influence individuals' willingness to participate in a VOC. The study tested a hypothesized model of VOC participation to understand how goals influenced each other and willingness to participate in a VOC. Several factors, reflecting a helping motivation overall, shaped willingness to participate in a VOC. The manuscript concludes with a discussion of implications for restorative justice researchers and practitioners. © 2015 International Association for Conflict Management and Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Communication; Interpersonal conflict; Justice; Third-party intervention",,,,,,,,,,"Ajzen, I., Fishbein, M., Attitude-behavior relations: A theoretical analysis and review of empirical research (1977) Psychological Bulletin, 84, pp. 888-918; Anderson, P.A., Guerrero, L.K., Principles of communication and emotion in social interaction (1998) The handbook of communication and emotion, pp. 49-97. , P.

We examine team member accuracy in identifying the presence of conflict between two team members and argue that individuals differ in the extent to which they accurately make judgments about conflict. We maintain that specific factors determine whether conflict is seen or not. We develop a framework for understanding individual conflict accuracy that takes into account pre-existing beliefs about the consequences that conflict has for team performance, the extent to which one is in conflict with other team members, and one's structural position within the network of team relationships. Our analyses of nearly 3,000 assessments made by team members about conflict between two of their teammates provide general support for the proposition that individual, interpersonal, and structural factors play a role in explaining team members' conflict accuracy. © 2015 International Association for Conflict Management and Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Accuracy; Conflict; Conflict beliefs; Network",,,,,,,,,,"Adler, P.S., Kwon, S.W., Social capital: Prospects for a new concept (2002) Academy of Management Review, 27, pp. 17-40; Allred, K.G., Anger and retaliation in conflict: The role of attribution (2000) The handbook of conflict resolution: Theory and practice, pp. 236-255. , M.

To achieve positive interaction outcomes, individuals may engage in a social perception process that leads them to believe they have obtained more information about others than these others gained about them. We investigate how asymmetric knowledge perceptions contribute to important aspects of negotiation, namely rapport building among strangers and egocentric beliefs about fairness of resource distribution. In Study 1, dyads completed measures of knowledge acquisition and partner evaluation after a rapport-building exercise. Results showed that individuals believed they gained more information about their partner than vice versa; notably, the magnitude of this knowledge bias was associated with more positive partner evaluations. Study 2 showed that the magnitude of the knowledge bias predicted lower egocentrism in a commons dilemma task.

This study addresses this issue though an international survey of managers focusing on actual negotiations. The 294 respondents reported on what actions they took as they sought to achieve an agreement, including how information was exchanged and how they looked for new solutions and managed concession making. The analysis suggests a pragmatic approach to negotiation, whereby information is not withheld, but neither is it freely given. Solutions emerge from discussion of priorities and commonalities rather than through more formal creative processes. The underlying script of negotiation appears to draw more on competitive than overtly collaborative tactics, suggesting that business negotiators are cautious co-operators. Further research avenues include investigating the pressures and context that impact upon negotiators' decision-making and closer examination of interactions between negotiation tasks en route to an agreement. © 2015 the International Association for Conflict Management and Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","International business negotiations; Negotiation processes and tasks; Outcome satisfaction",,,,,,,,,,"Agndal, H., (2007), Current trends in business negotiation research.

Withholding relational complaints not only impacts relationships but can also have implications for individual behaviors and emotions. This study examined cognitive activities and behavioral aggression involved in withholding relational complaints and the emotional impact of withholding. The student-based sample consisted of 395 participants who completed a survey about emotion regulation responses (rumination and reappraisal) to an irritating experience, passive aggressive behaviors (silent treatment and stonewalling), and emotional exhaustion. The findings provide evidence for posited mediated relationships between rumination and emotional exhaustion through passive aggressive behaviors.

The ingroup-outgroup conflict literature supports the notion that inside groups in conflict there are subgroups of intransigents seeking to ""fight it out,"" and flexibles seeking avenues for settlements. There is also support for the intransigents and flexibles in the two groups being susceptible to each other's goading to escalate conflicts or entreaties to reach agreement. However, since two-group conflicts are embedded in complex systems with which they interact, it is difficult to predict outcomes and to assess the chances that intervention strategies might succeed or fail. We propose to use the model of two-group conflicts based on the mutual susceptibilities of flexibles and intransigents (Kaufman & Kaufman, ) to construct toy model scenarios of possible conflict trajectories. For each scenario, we compute a Severity Index for Conflicts (SIC) that captures the likelihood that it will end in confrontation (rather than agreement). We offer some examples of intranational and international conflicts and show how the scenarios can be analyzed qualitatively to explore the range of possible outcomes. Further developments will include sensitivity analyses for various assumptions and asking ""what if"" questions that can inform strategies of response and intervention. © 2015 International Association for Conflict Management and Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Groups; Political crisis; Qualitative research",,,,,,,,,,"Bak, P., (1996) How nature works, , New York, NY: Springer Verlag; Brewer, M.B., Ingroup bias in the minimal intergroup situation: A cognitive motivational analysis (1979) Psychological Bulletin, 86, pp. 307-324; Brewer, M.B., The importance of being we (2007) American Psychologist, 62, pp. 728-738; Burgess, H., Burgess, G., Constructive confrontation: A transformative approach to intractable conflicts (1996) Mediation Quarterly, 13, pp. 303-322; Cairns, E., Kenworthy, J., Campbell, A., Hewstone, M., The role of in-group identification, religious group membership and intergroup conflict in moderating in-group and out-group affect (2006) British Journal of Social Psychology, 45, pp. 701-716; Castano, E., Yzerbyt, V., Paladino, M., Sacchi, S., I belong, therefore, I exist: Ingroup identification, ingroup entitativity, and ingroup bias (2002) Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, 28, pp. 135-143; Coleman, P.T., Schneider, A., James, C.C.F., Adams, D.S., Gameros, T.A., Hammons, L.R., Intragroup subgroup attitude clustering, external intervention, and intergroup interaction patterns: Toward a dynamical model of protracted intergroup conflict (2005) Peace and Conflict Studies, 12 (1), pp. 55-70; Crisp, R.J., Beck, S.R., Reducing intergroup bias: The moderating role of ingroup identification (2005) Group Processes & Intergroup Relations, 8, pp. 173-185; Deutsch, M., Justice and conflict (2000) The handbook of conflict resolution: Theory and practice, pp. 41-64. , M.

One hundred and forty-six dyads, in four combinations of power and gender, negotiated compensation agreements. In line with gender stereotypes, male negotiators were more dominating and females more obliging and somewhat more compromising. However, partially challenging the common association of power and masculinity, high-power negotiators were less dominating and more collaborating, obliging and avoiding than their low-power opponents. Generally, feminine and high-power behaviors induced agreement while masculine and low-power behaviors enhanced distributive personal gain. The study also assessed patterns of behavioral reciprocity and used sophisticated analytic tools to control for dyadic interdependence. Therefore it helps to elucidate the negotiation process and the role that power and its interplay with gender play in it. © 2015 International Association for Conflict Management and Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Dual-concern model; Gender; Negotiation behaviors; Negotiation dyadic effects; Negotiation outcomes; Power",,,,,,,,,,"Aguinis, H., Adams, S.K.R., Social-role versus structural models of gender and influence use in organizations (1998) Group & Organization Management, 23, pp. 414-446; Amanatullah, E.T., Morris, M.W., Negotiating gender roles: Gender differences in assertive negotiating are mediated by women's fear of backlash and attenuated when negotiating on behalf of others (2010) Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 98, pp. 256-267; Babcock, L., Laschever, S., (2003) Women don't ask: Negotiation and the gender divide, , Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press; Barron, L., Ask and you shall receive?

Starting with unofficial efforts by the Indonesian side from mid-2003, which eventually led the parties to the negotiation table and to the signing of the MoU in August 2005, the peace process put an end to the 30-year conflict over the independence of Aceh. The peaceful resolution of the Aceh conflict will be examined using readiness theory, which posits the factors that lead parties to negotiate, and the theory's hypotheses will be applied to understand the factors that contribute to success in negotiating a peace agreement. The study also examines the Aceh peace process from the perspective of central coalition theory, which relates to the readiness of the actors in the internal political debate to negotiate and reach an agreement. © 2014 International Association for Conflict Management and Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Case studies; Conflict management style; Ethnic conflict; Negotiation",,,,,,,,,,"Ahtisaari, M., Delivering peace for Aceh: An interview with President Martti Ahtisaari (2008) Reconfiguring politics: The Indonesia-Aceh peace process, , http://www.c-r.org/accord-article/delivering-peace-aceh-interview-president-martti-ahtisaari, In J.

However, existing models of behavior matching focus primarily on its prosocial functions. The current study explores whether both prosocial and adversarial sides of behavior matching can be found at different stages of an egoistic negotiation. In negotiations conducted over instant messenger, 64 dyads attempted to reach an agreement on four issues within 20 minutes while focusing solely on personal gain. We measured behavior matching with the language style matching (LSM) metric, which quantifies function word (e.g., pronouns, articles) similarity between partners. Although pairs with higher LSM throughout negotiations were more socially engaged, they were also less focused on the task and more likely to reach an impasse during the negotiation. Furthermore, early but not late style matching predicted more positive, socially attuned interactions. Implications for negotiation and mimicry research are discussed. © 2014 International Association for Conflict Management and Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Decision making; Engagement; Language style matching; Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count; Negotiation",,,,,,,,,,"Baddeley, J.B., (2011), Email communications among people with and without major depressive disorder.

In Study 1, we distinguished between high-honor and low-honor cultures. Participants' evaluations of a norm transgressor were gathered. Results indicated that high-honor participants devalued the transgressor more strongly in terms of morality than competence in comparison with low-honor participants. In Study 2, we distinguished between participants with high- and low-honor values and investigated morality and competence in self-perception. Participants were asked to respond to different types of insults gathered in Study 1. High-honor participants were primarily harmed in their morality after being insulted, while this prominence was less apparent in low-honor participants. Both studies showed that those who value honor highly moralize insults to a greater extent, because they take more offense to them. © 2014 International Association for Conflict Management and Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Conflict management; Honor culture; Insult; Morality",,,,,,,,,,"Anderson, E., The code of the streets (1994) The Atlantic Monthly, 273, pp. 81-94; Beersma, B., Harinck, F., Gerts, M.J.J., Bound in honor: How honor values and insults affect the experience and management of conflicts (2003) International Journal of Conflict Management, 14, pp. 75-94. , doi:10.1108/eb022892; Bond, M.H., Venus, C.K., Resistance to group or personal insults in an ingroup or outgroup context (1991) International Journal of Psychology, 26, pp. 83-94. , doi:10.1080/00207599108246851; Brambilla, M., Rusconi, P., Sacchi, S., Cherubini, P., Looking for honesty: The primary role of morality (vs. sociability and competence) in information gathering (2011) European Journal of Social Psychology, 41, pp. 135-143. , doi:10.1002/ejsp.744; Cohen, D., Cultural variation: Considerations and implications (2001) Psychological Bulletin, 127, pp. 451-471. , doi:10.1037/0033-2909.127.4.451; Cohen, D., Nisbett, R.E., Self-protection and the culture of honor: Explaining Southern violence (1994) Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, 20, pp. 551-567. , doi:10.1177/0146167294205012; Cohen, D., Nisbett, R.E., Field experiments examining the culture of honor: The role of institutions in perpetuating norms about violence (1997) Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, 23, pp. 1188-1199. , doi:10.1177/01461672972311006; Cohen, D., Nisbett, R.E., Bowdle, B.F., Schwarz, N., Insult, aggression, and the Southern culture of honor: An 'experimental ethnography (1996) Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 70, pp. 945-960. , doi:10.1037/0022-3514.70.5.945; Cohen, D., Vandello, J., The paradox of politeness (2004) Cultural shaping of violence: Victimization, escalation, response, pp. 119-132. , M.

However, we propose that people feel unsettled when enemies initiate friendly gestures. To resolve these sensemaking difficulties, people find order through superstitious reasoning about friendly enemies. Supporting this theorizing, friendly enemies created sensemaking difficulty, which in turn mediated people's tendencies to blame them for coincidental negative outcomes (Experiment 1). Further implicating these processes, individuals high in need for structure were especially prone to make these attributions (Experiment 2). Finally, we explored consequences of such blame, showing that blame mediates people's beliefs that mere contact with friendly enemies is unlucky and should be avoided (Experiment 3). Taken together, these results suggest that, rather than transforming hostile relationships, an enemy's friendliness can be so unnerving that it sometimes leads people down blind alleys of superstitious reasoning. © 2014 International Association for Conflict Management and Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Friendly gestures; Hostile relationships; Need for structure; Sensemaking difficulty; Superstition",,,,,,,,,,"Adams, G., The cultural grounding of personal relationship: Enemyship in North American and West African worlds (2005) Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 88, pp. 948-968. , doi:10.1037/0022-3514.88.6.948; Aiken, L.S., West, S.G., (1991) Multiple regression: Testing and interpreting interactions, , Newbury Park, CA: Sage; Alexander, M.G., Brewer, M.B., Livingston, R.W., Putting stereotype content in context: Image theory and interethnic stereotypes (2005) Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, 31, pp. 781-794. , doi:10.1177/0146167204271550; Baron, R.A., Countering the effects of destructive criticism: The relative efficacy of four potential interventions (1990) Journal of Applied Psychology, 75, pp. 235-245. , doi:10.1037/0021-9010.75.3.235; Baron, R.M., Kenny, D.A., The moderator-mediator variable distinction in social psychological research: Conceptual, strategic, and statistical considerations (1986) Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 51, pp. 1173-1182. , doi:10.1037/0022-3514.51.6.1173; Barry, B., Oliver, R.L., Affect in dyadic negotiation: A model and propositions (1996) Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes, 67, pp. 127-143. , doi:10.1006/obhd.1996.0069; Bies, R.J., Shapiro, D.L., Interactional justice: The influence of causal accounts (1987) Social Justice Research, 1, pp. 199-218. , doi:10.1007/BF01048016; Bond, C.F., Omar, A., Pitre, U., Lashley, B.R., Skaggs, L., Kirk, C.T., Fishy-looking liars: Deception judgment from expectancy violation (1992) Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 63, pp. 969-977. , doi:10.1037/0022-3514.63.6.969; Bottom, W.P., Gibson, K., Daniels, S., Murnighan, J.K., When talk is not cheap: Substantive penance and expressions of intent in the reestablishment of cooperation (2002) Organizational Science, 13, pp. 497-513. , doi:10.1287/orsc.13.5.497.7816; Burgoon, J.K., Walther, J.B., Nonverbal expectancies and the evaluative consequences of violations (1990) Human Communication Research, 17, pp. 232-265. , doi:10.1111/j.1468-2958.1990.tb00232.x; Burt, R., Knez, M., Trust and third-party gossip (1996) Trust in organizations: Frontiers of theory and research, pp. 68-89. , R.

This article extends prior negotiation research by investigating whether teams display greater wisdom than solos in knowing when to walk away from the negotiating table and thereby avoid the agreement trap. Two experiments compared teams and solos in a negotiation in which reaching agreement was unwise because of misaligned interests. The negotiation involved a real estate transaction in which the optimal solution was for the parties to declare an impasse. Study 1 found that two- and three-person teams were significantly more likely than solos to impasse. Study 2 found that the party faced with the greater need to make accurate judgments about the alignment between their own and their counterpart's interests benefited most from the addition of a teammate. These findings offer insight into why the agreement trap occurs and how it can be reduced. © 2014 International Association for Conflict Management and Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Agreement bias; Agreement trap; Groups; Impasse; Negotiation; Teams",,,,,,,,,,"Abrams, D., Marques, J.M., Bown, N., Henson, M., Pro-norm and anti-norm deviance within and between groups (2000) Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 78, pp. 906-912; Babcock, L., Loewenstein, G., Explaining bargaining impasse: The role of self-serving biases (1997) Journal of Economic Perspectives, 11, pp. 109-126; Baumeister, R.F., Leary, M.R., The need to belong: Desire for interpersonal attachments as a fundamental human-motivation (1995) Psychological Bulletin, 117, pp. 497-529; Bazerman, M.H., Neale, M.A., (1992) Negotiating rationally, , New York, NY: Free Press; Cho, Y., Overbeck, J.R., Carnevale, P.J., Status conflict in negotiation?

Drawing on theories of gender roles, we proposed that gender is an important factor that influences whether avoidant conflict management mitigates the negative affective effects of relationship conflict. In a field study of a healthcare organization, we found that relationship conflict resulted in negative emotions, which, in turn, were positively associated with emotional exhaustion two months later. Avoidant conflict management attenuated the relationship between negative emotions engendered by relationship conflict and emotional exhaustion, but this effect depended on gender. Among men, the extent to which they used an avoidant conflict management style mitigated the association between negative emotions and emotional exhaustion, whereas among women, avoidant conflict management did not attenuate this relationship.

Utilizing the dual threshold model (DTM) constructs of expressed and suppressed anger (Geddes & Callister, 2007), we find employees with high organizational commitment express anger to relevant others, that is, to management or to those responsible for the anger-provoking situation. In contrast, emotionally exhausted employees and those with high NA tend to suppress their anger, venting only to uninvolved parties or remaining silent. Findings also indicate a positive relationship with PA and anger expression-a connection rarely considered or examined in anger research. Further, expressed anger was predictive of perceived improvement with problematic situations, while suppressed anger forms led to perceptions that the situation at work deteriorated. © 2014 International Association for Conflict Management and Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Anger; Anger expression; Anger suppression; Emotion; Emotional exhaustion; Negative affect; Organizational commitment; Positive affect",,,,,,,,,,"Anderson, P.A., Guerrero, L.K., (1998) Principles of communication and emotion in social interaction, , New York, NY: Academic Press; Andersson, L.M., Employee cynicism: An examination using a contract violation framework (1996) Human Relations, 49, pp. 1395-1418; Aquino, K., Douglas, S., Martinko, M.J., Overt anger in response to victimization: Attributional style and organizational norms as moderators (2004) Journal of Occupational Health Psychology, 9, pp. 152-164; Ashkanasy, N.M., Emotions in organizations: A multilevel perspective (2003) Research in multi-level issues, pp. 9-54. , F.

But what does such a culture look like? Research from international and political relations has demonstrated that the level of integrative complexity (IC) as disseminated in political messages is an important factor in the context of conflict management. In our research, we hypothesize that, similar to political messages, corporate communication, which emphasizes a complex (i.e., differentiated and integrated) way of understanding multidimensional issues, is connected to cooperative conflict management and related variables like perceptions of organizational justice. Results of a multilevel field study support this proposition. Whereas the level of organizational IC was assessed by rating organizations' communication (specifically their vision or mission statements published on the Internet), perceptions of conflict management and justice were assessed by asking employees. The study emphasizes the utility of addressing organizational level variables in relation to organizational members' perceptions. © 2014 International Association for Conflict Management and Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Conflict management; Corporate communication; Integrative complexity; Organizational justice",,,,,,,,,,"Alper, S., Tjosvold, D., Law, K.S., Conflict management, efficacy, and performance in organizational teams (2000) Personnel Psychology, 53, pp. 625-642; Baker-Brown, G.B.E.J., Ballard, E.J., Bluck, S., de Vries, B., Suedfeld, P., Tetlock, P.E., The conceptual/integrative complexity scoring manual (1992) Motivation and personality: Handbook of thematic content analysis, pp. 401-418. , C.

In a longitudinal field experiment with student teams, we found that East Asian teams, compared to North American teams, experienced more relationship conflict at later stages of team tenure. We further found that, while relationship conflict undermined team identity in North American teams, relationship conflict did not influence team identity in East Asian teams. Our study counterintuitively finds that East Asian teams may be less influenced by relationship conflict than North American teams, despite their relationship maintenance orientation. We present several possible future avenues to unpack the psychological mechanisms underlying the distinct temporal patterns and outcome effects of relationship conflict in East Asian teams and implications for cross-cultural East Asian and North American teams. © 2014 International Association for Conflict Management and Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","East Asians; North Americans; Relationship conflict; Team identity; Teams/groups; Time",,,,,,,,,,"Adair, W.L., Hideg, I., Spence, J.R., The culturally intelligent team: The impact of team cultural intelligence and cultural heterogeneity on team shared values (2013) Journal of Cross-Cultural Psychology, 44, pp. 941-962; Bliese, P., Within-group agreement, non-independence, and reliability (2000) Multi-level theory, research, and methods in organizations: Foundations, extensions, and new directions, pp. 349-381. , K.

However, public campaigns related to labor-management conflicts impinge on the way negotiations are enacted. This study focuses on the turning points and conflict framing in the 2007-2008 conflict between the Writers Guild of America and the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers. Using media coverage and press releases, it examines turning points across critical events, communicative framing, and the role of a simultaneous corporate campaign in shaping the outcome of this negotiation. Overall, it demonstrates that procedural precipitants in combination with the corporate campaign triggered departures that escalated the conflict, while procedural and external precipitants shaped departures that led to an agreement. Writers Guild of America's particular brand of a soft corporate campaign played an important role in solidifying the labor union and garnering public support for the strike. © 2014 International Association for Conflict Management and Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Conflict framing; Corporate campaigns; Negotiation; Strikes; Turning points",,,,,,,,,,"Adair, W.L., Brett, J.M., The negotiation dance: Time, culture, and behavioral sequences in negotiation (2005) Organization Science, 16, pp. 33-51. , doi:10.1287/orsc.1040.0102; Adair, W.L., Loewenstein, J., Talking it through: Communication sequences in negotiation (2013) Handbook of research on negotiation, pp. 311-331. , In M.

Ray Hogler (Colorado State University) argues that the distinguishing feature of IR is its collectivist approach to work and organizations. As OB came to dominate the academic landscape, the research landscape shifted to a microanalytical focus. In consequence, business schools have failed to engage with the social problem of inequality of wealth. Early figures in American economic development, such as John D. Rockefeller, Jr., offered a more expansive vision of firms and labor than the current intellectual climate driven by an agency theory of management aimed at short-term profit. In his response, Stephen Gilliland (University of Arizona) asserts that the individualistic orientation of organizational justice provides a much more strategic and aligned approach to employee-employer relations. Unions provide a broad brush approach grounded in adversarial relationships and unfairness. By satisfying individual interests of fair treatment, leading through organizational justice provides benefits for employees, organizations, and their stakeholders. Fair treatment of employees has a ripple effect that impacts customer treatment and satisfaction.

Access was provided to two Somali pirates who were interviewed about their roles: a financier and a navigator. This article views these hostage negotiations as extortionate transactions, which requires negotiators to confront five paradoxes in the course of forging an outcome. The interviews with the two pirates reveal how the pirates and the ship owners who do the negotiations manage these paradoxes in the settling on a ransom. The interviews reveal how the hijackings are organized and financed, how the negotiations are organized logistically, how the ransoms are paid, and what happens when negotiations reach sticking points. The article concludes with a discussion of how the negotiations are shaped by the paradoxes as each side crafts its position. © 2014 International Association for Conflict Management and Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Crisis negotiations; Negotiation",,,,,,,,,,"Agne, R.R., Reframing practices in moral conflict: Interaction problems in the negotiation standoff at Waco (2007) Discourse & Society, 18, pp. 549-578. , doi:10.1177/0957926507079634; Bateson, G., Jackson, D.D., Haley, J., Weakland, J.H., A note on the Double Bind-1962 (1963) Family Process, 2, pp. 154-161. , doi:10.1111/j.1545.1963.00154; De Dreu, C.K., Coercive power and concession making in bilateral negotiation (1995) Journal of Conflict Resolution, 39, pp. 646-670. , doi:10.1177/0022002795039004003; Donohue, W.A., Crisis negotiation: Getting to normal ICA/Wiley-Blackwell encyclopedia of interpersonal communication, , (in press).

First, are the traits of argumentativeness, verbal aggressiveness, avoidance, and verbal benevolence reflected in conflict styles such that they are perceived by others? Second, how do these traits predict the five conflict styles in the dual concern model? These questions were tested using dyadic data from a simulated downsizing activity. Results showed that participants perceived their partners differently depending on the traits their partners endorsed. For example, people who reported being avoidant or verbally aggressive were less likely to be perceived as using the compromising style. Overall, the results suggested that the four traits investigated in this study are likely to be associated with observable behavior. Findings also demonstrated that these traits help differentiate the five conflict styles in more nuanced ways than predicted by the dual concern model. Finally, the results supported the idea that conflict styles are not only shaped by one's own traits but also by the traits of others and the interaction between two people's traits. © 2014 International Association for Conflict Management and Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Argumentativeness; Avoidance; Benevolence; Communication; Conflict; Conflict styles; Dual concern model; Verbal aggressiveness",,,,,,,,,,"Aiken, L.S., West, S.G., (1991) Multiple regression: Testing and interpreting interactions, , Newbury Park, CA: Sage; Anderson, C.M., Banerjee, M., Aggressive communication and conflict in small groups (2010) Arguments, aggression and conflict: New directions in theory and practice, pp. 305-317. , T.

This article links the practical experience of company managers with conflict management theory to posit that organizational capabilities are a crucial explanatory variable for the gap between desired and observed company performance in fragile contexts. It models a management system for conflict prevention with empirical and theoretical referents. The model provides practitioners with useful diagnostic entry points as they work to improve company operations. At the same time, it brings together diverse conflict management perspectives on company operations in fragile environments so that future case data may be ordered and compared and further theoretical propositions developed and tested. © 2014 International Association for Conflict Management and Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Business and conflict; Business and peace; Conflict prevention; Multinational enterprises; Risk management",,,,,,,,,,"Anderson, M.B., (1999) Do no harm: How aid can support peace - or war, , London, UK: Lynne Rienner; Anderson, M.B., False promises and premises?

We set out to contribute to the discussion of whether relationship conflict is dysfunctional and task conflict is functional in terms of the individual evaluations of group efficacy and group mind. Our sample is a field setting of 127 individuals within a Fortune 500 company. Individual perceptions of group efficacy and group mind scores were significantly higher when neither type of conflict was perceived to occur often as compared with when both types of conflict were perceived to occur often. After decoupling types of conflict, we found when only task conflict occurred often, the perceived efficacy and mind scores were significantly higher than when both types of conflict occurred often. This is a contradictory finding based on the existing literature that suggests task conflict negatively impacts emergent states. © 2014 International Association for Conflict Management and Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Group efficacy; Group mind; Relationship conflict; Task conflict",,,,,,,,,,"Ajzen, I., Fishbein, M., (1980) Understanding attitudes and predicting social behavior, , Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice Hall; Asch, S.E., (1952) Social psychology, , Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice-Hall; Bales, R.F., Strodtbeck, F.L., Phases in group problem solving (1951) Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology, 46, pp. 485-495. , doi:10.1037/h0059886; Bandura, A., (1997) Self-efficacy: The exercise of control, , New York, NY: W.H.

In this introduction to the special issue, we highlight some of the key areas of research in the field thus far, highlighting key debates and dialogues. We then present the four articles in this special issue, explaining how each of these articles contributes to a unique debate in this area.

This social disincentive has been shown to account for women's diminished likelihood to initiate negotiations relative to men. But we question whether women who ignored this disincentive and initiated negotiations would even receive the resources they requested. We extend past research by showing women also incur financial penalties for initiating negotiations. This financial penalty can be explained by women's lower ascribed status relative to men's status and fortunately can be attenuated if women have achieved status. In two studies, we find consistent evidence that women who ask do not receive unless they have externally conferred status. © 2013 International Association for Conflict Management and Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Backlash; Gender; Negotiation; Status",,,,,,,,,,"Amanatullah, E.T., Morris, M.W., Negotiating gender roles: Gender differences in assertive negotiating are mediated by women's fear of backlash and attenuated when negotiating on behalf of others (2010) Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 98, pp. 256-267; Amanatullah, E.T., Tinsley, C.H., Punishing female negotiators for asserting too much...or not enough: When advocacy moderates backlash (2013) Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes, 120, pp. 110-122; Ayres, I., Siegelman, P., Race and gender discrimination in bargaining for a new car (1995) American Economic Review, 85, pp. 304-321; Babcock, L., Gelfand, M.J., Small, D., Stayn, H., Gender differences in the propensity to initiate negotiations (2006) Social psychology and economics, pp. 239-262. , D.

Specifically, we compare face-to-face mediations and mediations in which an online intake is used before the joint face-to-face session (hybrid types of mediation). We assume that the use of an online intake before the joint mediation mitigates the effects of hierarchy on parties' satisfaction with the mediation. To test our hypotheses, we use data from real mediation cases dealing with hierarchical labor conflicts in the Netherlands. In line with our hypothesis, results show that supervisors feel more satisfied with the mediation when involved in a face-to-face mediation, but subordinates and supervisors feel equally satisfied when an online intake is used before the mediation.

These findings may be, in part, due to the socialization of men and women, which has resulted in a greater negotiation advantage for men than for women. It is, however, hypothesized that power affects men's and women's negotiation behavior in such a way that it positively influences women's negotiation behavior while men remain unaffected by it. In an experimental setting using a face-to-face distributive bargaining situation, participants were primed with the experience of having power and were subsequently asked to negotiate with an opponent about the asking price of a house. The results of this study show that women who were primed with the experience of having power made better first offers and negotiated better outcomes than women who were not. Men's first offers and negotiation outcomes turned out not to be affected by power. Moreover, results also show that power significantly reduced differences in negotiation outcomes between men and women. All in all, this study shows that power influences men's and women's behavior in negotiation differently. © 2013 International Association for Conflict Management and Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Gender; Negotiation; Power; Sense of power",,,,,,,,,,"Amanatullah, E.T., Morris, M.W., Negotiating gender roles: Gender differences in assertive negotiating are mediated by women's fear of backlash and attenuated when negotiating on behalf of others (2010) Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 98, pp. 256-267; Anderson, C., Galinsky, A.D., Power, optimism, and risk-taking (2006) European Journal of Social Psychology, 36, pp. 511-536; Barron, L.A., Ask and you shall receive?

We further explore whether those interpretations of dominance shape negotiation outcomes. The results of an experiment, along with the linguistic analyses of the e-mail messages themselves, indicate that negative affective expressions (anger) online positively influence perceptions of dominance, while displays of positive affect (happiness) can signal the opposite, especially when coupled with low resource power. Moreover, we find that anger displays in e-mails can influence individual gains positively, while perceptions of dominance mediate the relationship between displays of happiness and individual outcomes.

This article reports on a study of self-identified targets of mobbing, which advances understanding of the way the problem is conceptualized, including associated informal and formal power relationships with organizations. Participants report a number of experiences, such as lengthy investigations and escalation of conflict, that result in an increasingly unbalanced sense of power away from the individual and toward the organization. Revealed is a mismatch between the expected organizational justice processes and support and the actual experience. Findings support a five-stage process of mobbing, which commences with unresolved conflict and leads ultimately to expulsion from the organization. The study contributes an understanding of a sixth transformational stage that allows the development of personal agency and a rebalanced sense of power. Recommendations of strategic approaches to address the phenomenon of mobbing are discussed. © 2013 International Association for Conflict Management and Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Organizational justice; Procedural fairness; Workplace conflict; Workplace mobbing",,,,,,,,,,"Ayoko, O.B., Callan, V.J., Teams' reactions to conflict and teams/task and social outcomes: The moderating role of transformational and emotional leadership (2010) European Management Journal, 28, pp. 220-235; Boog, B., Logger, C., Exemplarian action research, empowerment and reciprocal adequation: Developing a networking method for refugees (2003) Revue Internationale de Psychosociologie, 7 (16-17), pp. 79-96; Bowling, N.A., Beehr, T.A., Workplace harassment from the victim's perspective: A theoretical model and meta-analysis (2006) Journal of Applied Psychology, 91, pp. 998-1012; Branch, S., Ramsay, S., Barker, M., Workplace bullying, mobbing and general harassment: A review (2012) International Journal of Management Reviews, , http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1468-2370.2012.00339.x/abstract, Retrieved from; Bryant, A., Charmaz, K., (2007) The SAGE handbook of grounded theory, , Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage; Calvey, J., Jansz, J., Women's experience of the workers compensation system (2005) Australian Journal of Social Issues, 40, pp. 285-312; Choi, K., Cho, B., Competing hypotheses analyses of the associations between group task conflict and group relationship conflict (2011) Journal of Organizational Behaviour, 32, pp. 1106-1126; Clarke, J., (2003), http://www.safework.sa.gov.au, Workplace bullying: Making a difference.

Despite the many parallels between CWB and conflict processes as well as scholars' calls for better integration, there has been surprisingly little cross-fertilization between these areas. Accordingly, the goal of this special issue is to provide an outlet for research and theory that have investigated CWB with a conflict lens. In this overview of the special issue, I begin by briefly describing the nature of CWB and possible reasons for the lack of integration with conflict research. I then provide an overview of the articles in this special issue and conclude with a synthesis and suggested future research questions. © 2013 International Association for Conflict Management and Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Aggression; Bullying; Conflict; Counterproductive work behavior; Deviance; Harassment; Incivility",,,,,,,,,,"Andersson, L.M., Pearson, C.M., Tit for tat?

This crisis included a siege of the firm's headquarters; the inception of a special labor-management negotiation process, a mandatory conciliation, issued by Argentina's Labor Ministry; a 150-worker layoff; the occupation of the firm's plant by 40 workers and their violent eviction by the provincial police force; the firm's threat to sell off all its assets; and a massive demonstration to pressure the U.S. Ambassador to Argentina. Eventually, the parties reached an agreement and signed Act of Reconciliation to end their conflict. To better understand its complex dynamics, we have used Druckman's turning-point framework-precipitants, departures, and consequences (Druckman, 1986, 2001; Druckman, Husbands, & Johnston,) to examine KFTA's conflict. Our single-case study explores how negotiators managed their organizational conflict and demonstrates the usefulness of the turning-point framework to extract practical implications. This may help labor-management negotiators to avoid conflicts or to attain better, enduring agreements. © 2013 International Association for Conflict Management and Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Dark side of employment relations; Organizational conflict management; Turning points in negotiations",,,,,,,,,,"Ackers, P., Frames of reference (2011) Human resource management: The key concepts, pp. 83-87. , C.

Negotiations are characterized by information asymmetries, and negotiators often have both opportunities and incentives to mislead their counterparts. Effective negotiators need to contend with the risk of being deceived, effectively respond when they identify deception, and manage the temptation to use deception themselves. In our review of deception research, we integrate emotion research. Emotions are both an antecedent and a consequence of deception, and we introduce the emotion deception model (EDM) to represent these relationships. Our model broadens our understanding of deception in negotiations and accounts for the important role of emotions in the deception decision process. © 2013 International Association for Conflict Management and Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Deception; Emotion; Ethics; Negotiation; Trust",,,,,,,,,,"Abbink, K., Irlenbusch, B., Renner, E., The moonlighting game: An experimental study on reciprocity and retribution (2000) Journal of Economic Behavior and Organization, 42, pp. 265-277; Akerlof, G.A., The market for ""lemons"": Quality uncertainty and the market mechanism (1970) The Quarterly Journal of Economics, 84, pp. 488-500; Aquino, K., The effects of ethical climate the availability of alternatives on the use of deception during negotiation (1998) International Journal of Conflict Management, 9, pp. 195-217; Banaji, M.R., Bazerman, M.H., Chugh, D., How (un)ethical are you?

Data collected in association with an MBA teambuilding exercise showed that when women played third party roles in which they lacked authority over disputants, they were able to facilitate an outcome that was both acceptable to disputants and met organizational interests, more than men in these roles or than men and women in third party roles with authority. Behavioral data suggested that this effect was due to women in the third party peer role eschewing and men in the third party role displaying agentic behavior. The study contributes to the literature on gender, leadership, and conflict management by showing women's traditional leadership strengths of collaboration and participation can result in unique outcomes when they have less rather than more authority over disputants. © 2013 International Association for Conflict Management and Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Conflict management style; Gender; Negotiation; Third party intervention",,,,,,,,,,"Amanatullah, E., Morris, M.W., Negotiating gender roles: Gender differences in assertive negotiating are mediated by women's fear of backlash and attenuated when negotiating on behalf of others (2010) Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 98, pp. 256-267; Anderson, C., Berdahl, J.L., The experience of power: Examining the effects of power on approach and inhibition tendencies (2002) Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 83, pp. 1362-1377; Anderson, C.A., Galinsky, A.D., Power, optimism, and the proclivity for risk (2006) European Journal of Social Psychology, 36, pp. 511-536; Belle, F., (1991) Etre femme et cadre, , Paris, France: L'Harmatan; Bem, D., The measurement of psychological androgyny (1974) Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology, 42, pp. 155-162; Bies, J., Are procedural and interactional justice distinct?

We hypothesized that when the racial backgrounds of the negotiators are salient, threat inherent in negotiations activates in-group affect for some White negotiators (those more ""glad to be White""), triggering divergent negotiation approaches with White versus Black counterparts. In support of our hypotheses, we found that when negotiating with a Black confederate, stronger in-group affect of White participants was a liability, relating to poorer joint outcomes and a ""chilling and competing"" negotiation approach. When negotiating with a White confederate, stronger in-group affect of White participants instead boosted the dyad's joint outcomes by fostering greater trust. The meaning and practical implications of strong in-group affect in negotiations with diverse counterparts are discussed. © 2013 International Association for Conflict Management and Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Diversity; In-group affect; Negotiation; Race; Social identification",,,,,,,,,,"Adair, W.L., Integrative sequences and negotiation outcome in same- and mixed- culture negotiations (2003) International Journal of Conflict Management, 14, pp. 273-296; Adair, W.L., Okumura, T., Brett, J.M., Negotiation behavior when cultures collide: The United States and Japan (2001) Journal of Applied Psychology, 86, pp. 371-385; Ayres, I., Siegelman, P., Race and gender discrimination in negotiation for the purchase of a new car (1995) American Economic Review, 84, pp. 304-321; Bacharach, S.B., Bamberger, P.A., Vashdi, D., Diversity and homophily at work: Supportive relations among White and African-American peers (2005) Academy of Management Journal, 48, pp. 619-644; Beersma, B., De Dreu, C.K.W., Integrative and distributive negotiation in small groups: Effects of task structure, decision rule, and social motive (2002) Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes, 87, pp. 227-252; Ben-Yoav, O., Pruitt, D.G., Resistance to yielding and the expectation of cooperative future interaction in negotiation (1984) Journal of Experimental Social Psychology, 20, pp. 323-335; Bergsieker, H.B., Shelton, N., Richeson, J.A., To be liked versus respected: Divergent goals in interracial interactions (2010) Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 99, pp. 248-264; Bettencourt, B.A., Molix, L., Talley, A., Eubanks, J.P., Numerical representation and cross-cut role assignments: Majority members' responses under cooperative interaction (2007) Journal of Experimental Social Psychology, 43, pp. 553-564; Blascovich, J., Mendes, W.B., Hunter, S.B., Lickel, B., Kowai-Bell, N., Perceiver threat in social interactions with stigmatized others (2001) Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 80, pp. 253-267; Bombay, A., Matheson, K., Anisman, H., Decomposing identity: Differential relationships between several aspects of ethnic identity and the negative effects of perceived discrimination among First Nations adults in Canada (2010) Cultural Diversity and Ethnic Minority Psychology, 16, pp. 507-516; Bowles, H.R., Babcock, L., McGinn, K.L., Constraints and triggers: Situational mechanisms of gender in negotiation (2005) Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 89, pp. 951-965; Branscombe, N., Wann, D., Collective self-esteem consequences of outgroup derogation when a valued social identity is on trial (1994) European Journal of Social Psychology, 24, pp. 641-657; Brewer, M.B., The psychology of prejudice: Ingroup love or outgroup hate?

In an experiment in which 41 honor and 41 dignity participants reacted to a conflict situation with or without insult, we showed that-as long as they are not insulted-people from honor cultures handled potential conflict situations more constructively than people from dignity cultures.

In Study 1, negotiators with learning goals had lower rates of impasse and were judged to be most cooperative. Study 2 replicated these results using a different task and also compared the impact of learning and performance goals to dispositional goal orientation. We found that implicit negotiation beliefs, derived from theories of dispositional goal orientation, were associated with value claiming and interacted with goal type such that the relationship was strongest in the learning goal condition. In addition, negotiators with learning goals developed greater understanding about their counterpart's interests and created more integrative deals. These results show that negotiated outcomes are influenced by both goal type and the extent to which negotiators view their skills as malleable. © 2013 International Association for Conflict Management and Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Achievement goals; Distributive bargaining; Goal setting; Impasse rates; Implicit negotiation beliefs; Integrative bargaining; Learning goals; Negotiation",,,,,,,,,,"Adler, S., Weiss, H.M., Recent developments in the study of personality and organizational behavior (1988) International review of industrial and organizational psychology, 3, pp. 307-330. , C.

Three phases of the initiation process are examined-engaging, requesting, and optimizing-through three negotiation scenarios offering corresponding forced-choice behavioral options. Results suggest that, overall, the recognition of negotiable opportunities and the interaction of recognition and self-efficacy best predict initiation intentionality. More specifically, recognition and the interaction of recognition and self-efficacy were significantly associated with the likelihood of making a request, whereas the interaction of recognition and self-efficacy was significantly associated with the likelihood of optimizing that request.

This article begins by presenting a conception of dialogue as a relational practice. Ethnomethodological conversation analysis (CA) is introduced as a research method well suited to explicating practices of talk that contribute to or undermine relational interaction and dialogue in negotiation and conflict resolution contexts. We present two case studies of two parties negotiating a lease. Comparison of the two instances isolates practices that accomplish or move away from relational interaction and dialogue. This precedes a closing discussion of dialogic phenomena that could be mapped onto sequentially organized interactive practices, allowing them to be identified and studied in actual interactions. Such analysis offers valuable potential for understanding the actual discursive forms that contribute to relational approaches and dialogue and that help cultivate relational awareness and dialogic mindset in practice. © 2013 International Association for Conflict Management and Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Conversation analysis; Dialogue; Ethno-methodology; Mediation; Negotiation; Relationality",,,,,,,,,,"Atkinson, J.M., Heritage, J., (1984) Structures of social action: Studies in conversation analysis, , amp; (Eds).

By focusing on the motive to preserve balanced relationships within groups, we present a novel view on how and when trust repair is likely to occur in teams and workgroups. We also argue why such balanced states are likely to be more than just transitory, and why people attempt to rebalance systems rendered imbalanced by a breach. In addition, by examining the balance motive in trust relations, we conjecture about when trust judgments and behavior are likely to converge (or diverge) among the members of teams and work groups. Our approach contributes to an emerging stream of literature on the role of third parties and social groups on conflict and trust in teams and workgroups.

Participants were 134 undergraduates acting as buyers or sellers in a single-issue price negotiation. Buyers received instructions to set more or less ambitious aspirations. Buyers who set more ambitious aspirations achieved better economic outcomes. However, sellers paired with buyers setting more ambitious aspirations found their buyers to be less likeable, expressed less willingness to cooperate with them in the future, and behaved less generously toward them in a postnegotiation dictator game. The perceived likeability of the buyer explained why the sellers were less willing to cooperate in the future with buyers who had set more ambitious aspirations. This research contributes to the understanding of the downside of setting high aspirations in a competitive negotiation and provides implications on balancing one-time economic gain with future social loss. © 2013 International Association for Conflict Management and Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Aspirations; Future cooperation; Negotiation",,,,,,,,,,"Babcock, L., Loewenstein, G., Explaining bargaining impasse: The role of self-serving biases (1997) Journal of Economic Perspectives, 11, pp. 109-126; Barry, B., Oliver, R.L., Affect in dyadic negotiation: A model and propositions (1996) Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes, 67, pp. 127-143; Ben-Yoav, O., Pruitt, D.G., Resistance to yielding and the expectation of cooperative future interaction in negotiation (1984) Journal of Experimental Social Psychology, 20, pp. 323-335; Buelens, M., Van Poucke, D., Determinants of a negotiator's initial opening offer (2004) Journal of Business and Psychology, 19, pp. 23-35; Cialdini, R.B., Trost, M.R., Social influence: Social norms, conformity, and compliance (1998) The handbook of social psychology, pp. 151-192. , In D.

This article provides a review of such approaches before offering a number of alternatives that potentially contain more value for moving terrorism research forward. These approaches are illustrated by a series of analyses of a data set of 219 Palestinian suicide bombers: a descriptive analysis of the socio-demographic characteristics of suicide bombers, their pathways into terrorist organizations, their spatial patterning and issues concerned with lethality.

We propose a conceptualization that distinguishes a message's support for an act from its support for the ideology underlying an act. Our prediction is tested using corpus-linguistic analysis of 250 counter-extremist messages written by Muslims and U.K. officials and a comparison set of 250 Muslim extremist messages. Consistent with our prediction, Muslim extremist and Muslim counter-messages show disagreement on terrorist actions but agreement in ideological aspects, while U.K. officials' counter-messages show disagreement with both Muslim extremists' acts and ideology. Our findings suggest that counter-messages should not be viewed as a homogenous group and that being against violent extremism does not necessarily equate to having positive perceptions of Western values. © 2012 International Association for Conflict Management and Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Counter; Extreme; Ideology; Messages; Violence",,,,,,,,,,"Beutel, A.J., (2007), http://www.minaret.org/MPAC%20Backgrounder.pdf, Radicalization and homegrown terrorism in Western Muslim communities: Lessons learned for America.

The basic proposition is that comparison of the names of nonviolent and violent political organizations reveals core characteristics of terrorist organizations. Accordingly, eight characteristics are identified: Hostility, Absolutism, Authoritarianism, Action Orientation, Resistance, Militancy, Achievement Motivation, and Superiority. An empirical study among college students, comparing those preferring groups that possess these characteristics with those preferring groups that do not possess these characteristics, shows that greater endorsement of groups that possess these characteristics is associated with greater support for group-based violence. Representation theory provides a novel way of looking at terrorism, specifies indicators of violent intent and generates new hypothesis regarding the nature of terrorism. © 2012 International Association for Conflict Management and Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Content analysis; Groups; Political organization names; Terrorism",,,,,,,,,,"Aaker, J., Benet-Martínez, V., Garolera, J., Consumption symbols as carriers of culture: A study of Japanese and Spanish brand personality constucts (2001) Journal of Personality And Social Psychology, 81 (3), pp. 492-508; (1995) Terrorism in context, , Crenshaw, M.

By means of structural equation modeling, we find that (a) perceived injustice, (b) perceived group threat, (c) relative deprivation, and (d) identification with the Dutch are important background determinants of a radical right-wing belief system (e.g., perceived in-group superiority, perceived illegitimacy of Dutch authorities, perceived distance to others, and a feeling of being socially disconnected). Perceived in-group superiority in turn is positively associated with endorsement of right-wing motivated violence, which is a determinant of own violent intentions.

However, despite the fact that the conflict setting and dynamics of overseas cases arguably differ from domestic deployments, police negotiators in many countries are not specifically selected nor trained to operate overseas. There is also a lack of research on the subject. Based on semi-structured interviews with police negotiators from a number of different countries, this article seeks to fill this gap. We report our findings in relation to three main themes: the type of incidents overseas negotiators are involved in and the consequences for the negotiation process, the negotiator role and (team) context, and the multitude of parties involved. We conclude with identifying ways through which operational deployment and negotiator training can be improved to account for overseas deployment issues. © 2012 International Association for Conflict Management and Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Crisis negotiations; Negotiation",,,,,,,,,,"Charlés, L.L., (2008) When the shooting stopped.

Three studies are reviewed. One finds that while there are patterns of stylistic practice in mediation, there is no agreement on the definitions for different styles. The second finds that mediators tend to practice in either a directive or a reflective style within a given mediation, rather than using a mix of strategies. The final study highlights how different mediator strategies affect participant satisfaction with the process.

In the hopes of closing the research-practice gap, we consider the practical and conceptual importance of conducting research on mediator style. We then present an overview of what is known empirically about mediator stylistic behavior, with an emphasis on the research papers in this volume. Those papers address three major issues: (a) What mediators say about their stylistic preferences; (b) the degree to which mediators show stylistically flexibility; and (c) the relative impact of mediator style on the process and outcomes of mediation. We thenconsider why the empirical record on mediator style is still relatively weak, and we offer suggestions for moving forward along more vigorous research lines. © 2012 International Association for Conflict Management and Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Mediation research; Mediator style; Mediator style research",,,,,,,,,,"Alberts, J.K., Heisterkamp, B.L., McPhee, R.M., Disputant perceptions of and satisfaction with a community mediation program (2005) International Journal of Conflict Management, 16, pp. 218-244; Bercovitch, J., (1999) International conflict management 1945-1995: Official codebook for the International Conflict Management dataset, , Christchurch, New Zealand: University of Canterbury; Bercovitch, J., Lee, S., Mediating international conflicts: Examining the effectiveness of directive strategies (2003) International Journal of Peace Studies, 8, pp. 1-17; Bush, R.A.B., Folger, J.P., (1994) The promise of mediation: Responding to conflict through empowerment and recognition, , San Francisco, CA: Jossey-Bass; Charkoudian, L., de Ritis, C., Buck, R., Wilson, C.L., Mediation by any other name would smell as sweet - or would it?

The research employed mixed methods, including quantitative and qualitative survey methods, interviews, and archival data. This article focuses on how that research examined facilitative and transformative mediation styles. The research illustrates that organizational context can shape the effects of a mediator's style. It also indicates that the transformative style - by emphasizing the goals of disputant empowerment as well as recognition and by preventing mediator evaluation - may heighten disputants' perceptions of interpersonal justice (i.e. between the disputants) and reduce the perceptions of structural bias. © 2012 International Association for Conflict Management and Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Facilitative; Mediation; Postal service; Transformative",,,,,,,,,,"Anderson, J.F., Bingham, L.B., Upstream effects from mediation of workplace disputes: Some preliminary evidence from the USPS (1997) Labor Law Journal, 48, pp. 601-615; Bingham, L.B., Mediating employment disputes: Perceptions of REDRESS at the United States Postal Service (1997) Review of Public Personnel Administration, 17 (2), pp. 20-30; Bingham, L.B., Why suppose?

From this perspective, influence is essentially a meaning-based phenomenon that represents an interpretive view of organizational communication. Although some research exists that holds similar notions of managerial conflict influence, most research embodies a transmission view of communication and influence. Based on a qualitative analysis of 30 semi-structured interviews, managerial conflict influence can be conceptualized according to two theoretical dimensions, directness and communicative influence, including five subdimensions: direct, indirect, distant, constraining, and enabling. A tentative typology of managerial conflict influence using the identified dimensions is proposed. Finally, theoretical and practical notions as well as limitations of the study are discussed. © 2012 International Association for Conflict Management and Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Conflict styles; Managerial influence; Organizational communication; Organizational conflict; Social complexity; Third-party intervention",,,,,,,,,,"Andrade, L., Plowman, D., Duchon, D., Getting past conflict reduction: A complexity view of conflict (2008) Emergence: Complexity & Organization, 10 (1), pp. 23-38; Aula, P., Chaos and the double function of communication (1996) Studies of Nonlinear Phenomena in Life Science, 5, pp. 191-206; Aula, P., (1999) Organisaation kaaos vai kaaoksen organisaatio?

To test the effects of the factors, we had 120 subjects participate in a laboratory experiment wherein they negotiated over three issues. The results indicate that negotiators share more information (i.e., disclose information about their BATNA and about their payoffs) when their opponents share information (i.e., disclose information about BATNA and about payoffs) and when their opponents call for the negotiators to share information. Information about the previous negotiators' performance did not affect the negotiators' own information sharing. However, the negotiators did have high aspirations when presented with a mix of information-that some previous negotiators had attained high outcomes and others had attained low outcomes. © 2012 International Association for Conflict Management and Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Information sharing; Integrative negotiations; Negotiations; Negotiator behavior",,,,,,,,,,"Arnold, J.A., O'Connor, K.M., Ombudspersons or peers?

The study also introduces cultural metacognition, a dimension of cultural intelligence (Earley & Ang, 2003), as an antecedent of fusion teamwork and creativity. Data were from 246 members of 37 multicultural teams. Results generated from a multilevel modeling analysis were consistent with hypotheses: Across teams, when team members were more highly culturally metacognitive, fusion teamwork and creativity were more likely. All analyses were controlled for generalized affect toward the team to reduce threats to validity of common method bias and affect. The results suggest the value of fusion teamwork for generating creativity in multicultural teams and the importance of having members of multicultural teams who have high versus low levels of cultural metacognition. © 2012 International Association for Conflict Management and Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Culture; Multicultural teams; Teams",,,,,,,,,,"Amabile, T.M., Conti, R., Coon, H., Lazenby, J., Herron, M., Assessing the work environment for creativity (1996) Academy of Management Journal, 39, pp. 1154-1184; Ang, S., Van Dyne, L., Koh, C., Ng, K.Y., Templer, K., Tay, C., Cultural intelligence: Its measurement and effects on cultural judgment and decision making, cultural adaptation and task performance (2007) Management and Organization Review, 3, pp. 335-371; Armbruster, B.B., Metacognition in creativity (1989) Handbook of creativity, pp. 177-182. , In J.

Generally, arbitration has resolved the conflict. However, a trend has emerged in which the losing party seeks a court as a second forum for the resolution of the dispute in order to have the decision of the arbitrator vacated. This study analyzed 101 randomly selected cases out of a population of 573 cases in which vacatur of an arbitration award was sought. In approximately 30% of these cases, the arbitration award was in fact vacated.

Building on results obtained in several recent studies on justice in negotiation, we examine a set of hypotheses about relationships among negotiating process (as distributive bargaining or problem solving), justice (as procedural and distributive), outcomes (as compromise or integrative), and the duration of the agreements. The process variables were coded from negotiators' statements with categories from the bargaining process analysis system. The justice variables were coded with a system developed in recent studies on peace agreements. Similar to the results obtained by Hollander-Blumoff and Tyler (2008: 473) in a simulated legal setting, we find correlations between procedural justice, problem solving, and integrative outcomes. Similar to the results obtained by Druckman and Albin (2011: 1137) on peace agreements, we find a strong relationship between distributive justice and the durability of the agreement. In these cases, problem-solving processes were shown to mediate the relationship between procedural justice and integrative outcomes. The findings suggest that justice plays an important role across a variety of negotiation settings. We present these results as heuristic, suggesting avenues for further research on larger and more diverse samples of cases. © 2012 International Association for Conflict Management and Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Distributive bargaining; Distributive justice; Durability of agreements; Integrative outcomes; Inter-governmental negotiation; Problem solving; Procedural justice",,,,,,,,,,"Adams, J.S., Inequity in social exchange (1965) Advances in experimental social psychology, 2, pp. 267-299. , L.

The theory underlying the creation of a cooperative context is social interdependence theory. Goal interdependence may be positive (i.e., cooperative) or negative (i.e., competitive). Creating a cooperative context will both help prevent destructively managed conflicts and help create positive relationships. The long-term maintenance of a cooperative context depends on resolving conflicts constructively. Individuals need to learn how to resolve conflicts of interests through integrative negotiation and peer mediation. Individuals also need to learn how to resolve intellectual disagreements through the constructive controversy procedure. Intellectual disagreements are inherent in all decision making. Finally, engaging in cooperative efforts and resolving conflicts constructively inculcates civic values. It is the combination of cooperative experiences, constructive conflict resolution, and civic values that most effectively ensures that all relevant parties can redress past wrongs and reconcile with each other. © 2012 International Association for Conflict Management and Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Civic values; Conflict resolution; Controversy; Cooperation; Justice; Negotiation; Restorative justice",,,,,,,,,,"Asher, S., Rose, A., Promoting children's social-emotional adjustment with peers (1997) Emotional development and emotional intelligence: educational implications, pp. 196-203. , P.

The question of the impact of international war crimes tribunals on peace efforts is increasingly important with the advent of a permanent International Criminal Court whose cases to date are all active conflict situations. Drawing on interviews with key actors during the war in Bosnia, this paper presents the perspective of mediators, the ICTY prosecution, and parties to the conflict in examining whether the pursuit of justice during the Bosnian war impeded the pursuit of peace. © 2012 International Association for Conflict Management and Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Justice; Peace making; Peace talks; War crimes",,,,,,,,,,"Allcock, J.B., Biro, M., Gordy, E.D., Mertus, J., Oloffson, R.M., (2006), http://www.cla.purdue.edu/academic/history/facstaff/Ingrao/si/scholars.htm, (Eds.).

This article examines why some rebel groups are flexible on the main issue of contention, whereas others are not. The study explores rebels' social network structure as a source of negotiation flexibility. The proposition that a rebel group structured as a ""trust network"" can manage the risks of peace making through a ""trust mechanism"" of information sharing, verification, and mutual influence between rebel negotiators and non-negotiating rebel leaders, is consistent with a procedural justice logic. The proposition is analyzed for negotiations between LTTE and the Sri Lankan government, and Gerakan Aceh Merdeka (GAM) and the Indonesian government. The findings support the proposition, and highlight the potential of social network analysis to further the understanding of conflict resolution. Policy wise, the evolution of network structure implies that the likelihood of negotiation success varies over time. © 2012 International Association for Conflict Management and Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Ethnic conflict; Negotiation; Network analysis; Rebels; Trust",,,,,,,,,,"Aguswandi Zunzer, W., (2008) From politics to arms to politics again, , Berlin: Berghof Research Center for Constructive Conflict Management; Albin, C., (2001) Justice and fairness in international negotiations, , Cambridge: Cambridge University Press; Albin, C., Using negotiation to promote legitimacy: an assessment of proposals for reforming the WTO (2008) International Affairs, 84 (4), pp. 757-775; Albin, C., Druckman, D., Equality matters: negotiating an end to civil wars Journal of Conflict Resolution, , (forthcoming); Arquilla, J., Ronfeldt, D., The advent of netwars (2001) Networks and netwars: the future of terror, crime and militancy, pp. 1-28. , J.

The findings indicate that the dispute coming to ulema (Islamic scholars who are experts in Islamic legal jurisprudence) forms three cluster types: marital, financial, and those related to fights and accidents. The ulema's legitimacy is faith and knowledge based, and does not depend solely on professional expertise, procedures, or settings. Transformational, facilitative, and muscle mediation approaches do not directly correspond to the ulema's third-party approaches. Family elder/counselor, peace-broker, and facilitator/arbitrator are indigenous third-party roles. Their techniques include elements of the mediation procedures employed in western contexts, as well as those originating in Islamic law, such as fatwa, kidotlesssas-diya, and providing explanations according to sharia. Ulema do not get additional help from other third parties and do not socialize with disputants. Adelet (""justice""), mahremiyet (""privacy""), kardeşlik (""brotherhood""), and baǧidotlessşlamak (""forgiveness"") are concepts and metaphors to which reference is frequently made in explaining the logic and fundamental values of the ulema's intervention. © 2012 International Association for Conflict Management and Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Interpersonal conflict; Mediation; Third party intervention",,,,,,,,,,"Abu-Nimer, M., Conflict resolution approaches: Western and Middle Eastern Lessons and possibilities (1996) American Journal of Economics and Sociology, 55 (1), pp. 35-52; Al-Krenawi, A., Integrating cultural rituals into family therapy: A case study with a Bedouin-Arab patient in Israel (1999) Journal of Family Psychotherapy, 10 (1), pp. 61-73; Berry, J.W., Imposed etics, emics, and derived etics: Their conceptual and operational and operational status in cross-cultural psychology (1990) Emics and etics: The insider/outsider debate, pp. 84-99. , In T.

This study investigates whether relational closeness in work groups buffers the negative association between relationship conflict and two important group behaviors that are often overlooked in conflict research: group-level helping behavior and counterproductive work behavior. The results of this field study show that the degree of relational closeness in work groups indeed buffers the negative affiliation between relationship conflict and group-level helping behavior and the positive association between relationship conflict and group-level counterproductive work behavior. Specifically, the results suggest that relationship conflicts are only harmful in relationally distant work groups in which members do not know each other well personally and do not feel close to each other. Theoretical implications and suggestions for organizational practice are discussed. © 2011 International Association for Conflict Management and Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Groups; Interpersonal conflict; Organizational conflict",,,,,,,,,,"Adams, R., Laursen, B., The organization and dynamics of adolescent conflict with parents and friends (2001) Journal of Marriage and Family, 63, pp. 97-110; Aiken, L.S., West, S.G., (1991) Multiple regression: Testing and interpreting interactions, , Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage; Allen, V.L., Greenberger, D.B., Destruction and perceived control (1980) Advances in environmental psychology, pp. 84-109. , A.
