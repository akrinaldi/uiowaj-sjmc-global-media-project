This study investigated a model which proposes that the use of Facebook predicts relationship support from Facebook connections, and this, in turn, predicts relationship stability and satisfaction in romantic relationships. This mediation model was tested on data gathered via an online survey among individuals who use Facebook, who are in long-distance (LDRR, n = 142) and geographically-close romantic relationships (GCRR, n = 314). GCRR participants reported higher levels of Facebook intensity and relationship support, as well as perceived relationship stability and satisfaction than participants in LDRR. Moreover, the results indicated that Facebook intensity predicted higher access to Facebook relationship support in LDRR and GCRR which, in turn, predicted perceived relationship stability and satisfaction in LDRR; and only perceived relationship satisfaction in GCRR. However, Facebook intensity had direct negative impacts on relationship satisfaction in GCRR, and on perceived relationship stability in LDRR. Facebook intensity and Facebook relationship support were not associated with relationship stability in GCRR. This demonstrates the relative importance of SNSs, such as Facebook, in relationship stability for those in LDRR. © 2007-2020 Cyberpsychology.","Facebook; Network support; Relationship satisfaction; Relationship stability; Romantic relationships; Social network sites",,,,,,,,,,"Ahmad, I., The most popular social media platforms of 2019 (2019), https://www.digitalinformationworld.com/2019/01/most-popular-global-social-networks-apps-infographic.html, (January 1).

Drawing upon the three-factor model of identity development (Crocetti, Rubini &amp; Meeus, 2008), this study seeks to determine the relationship between Instagram comparisons of ability and opinion and three identity processes: commitment, in-depth exploration, and reconsideration of commitment. 177 British adolescents responded to a paper survey (Mage = 15.45; Female, 54.8%) between December 2018 and February 2019. Instagram social comparisons of ability were positively associated with commitment and in-depth exploration, whilst their relationship with reconsideration of commitment was moderated by gender. In contrast, Instagram social comparisons of opinion were positively related with in-depth exploration and reconsideration of commitment. Findings suggest that although both forms of social comparison behaviour may evoke adolescents to explore their identity, Instagram social comparisons of ability may have less maladaptive identity implications for adolescent males. © 2007-2020 Cyberpsychology: Journal of Psychosocial Research on Cyberspace.","Adolescent; Identity development; Identity dimensions; Instagram; Social comparison; Variable-centred",,,,,,,,,,"Arnett, J.J., Emerging adulthood: A theory of development from the late teens through the twenties (2000) American Psychologist, 55 (5), pp. 469-480. , https://doi.org/10.1037/0003-066X.55.5.469; Arnett, J.J., (2015) Emerging Adulthood: The Winding Road from The Late Teens through The Twenties, , 2nd ed.).

A mixed factorial experiment [2 (high vs. low threat) × 2 (high vs. low efficacy) × 2 (topic)] was conducted online with a sample of 214 participants recruited from United States. Process regression analysis results indicated that (1) high threat message elicited significant higher intention to share fear appeal messages on SNS; (2) fear arousal significantly enhanced intention to share risk messages directly; (3) high efficacy message resulted in higher intention to share fear appeal messages on SNS through the moderated mediated effect of information processing and intention to follow the health advice; and (4) individual’s intention to promote image on SNS was positively related to intention to share.

This research question was evaluated in a sample of 2,039 (52% female) high school students from the Illinois Study of Bullying and Sexual Violence (ISBSV) using two waves of longitudinal data. Two hypotheses were tested in two separate analyses, using bullying and cyberbullying data in one analysis, and sexual harassment and cyber-sexual harassment data in the other analysis. The stepping-stone hypothesis predicted that children would use the anonymity of cyber-bullying/harassment as a stepping stone or learning curve toward eventual involvement in face-to-face bullying/harassment. The displacement hypothesis, by contrast, held that children victimized face-to-face with traditional forms of bullying/harassment would seek release from their victimization by engaging in the largely anonymous activities of cyberbullying and cyber-sexual harassment. In both the bullying and harassment analyses, the pathway running from traditional bullying/harassment victimization to cyber-bullying/harassment perpetration proved significant, consistent with the displacement hypothesis. The pathway running from cyber aggression to traditional aggression failed to achieve significance in both the bullying and harassment analyses, providing no support for the stepping-stone hypothesis.

Moreover, FoMO has been found to be a key predictor of PSU. This suggests that PSU may mediate the relation between FoMO and decreased emotional well-being but this pathway has never been tested. Moreover, in most studies on PSU, the multidimensional nature of this construct has been ignored. The aim of the present study was to address these gaps by directly testing the mediating role of (subdimensions of) PSU in the association between FoMO and emotional well-being. We conducted a cross-sectional study with Estonian participants (n = 426). Using a simple mediation analysis, we found that PSU partially mediated the relationship between FoMO and decreased emotional well-being. Using a parallel mediation analysis, we found that two specific dimensions of PSU were significant mediators of the relationship between FoMO and decreased emotional well-being: Cyberspace-oriented Relations and Physical Symptoms. This suggests that the negative relationship between FoMO and decreased emotional well-being is due to FoMO stimulating (a) online relationships at the cost of offline interactions and (b) Physical symptoms associated with excessive smartphone use. Overall, this study provides a fine-grained analysis of the relationship between FoMO, PSU and emotional well-being. © 2007-2020 Cyberpsychology.","Cyberspace-oriented relationships; Emotional well-being; Fear of missing out; Physical symptoms; Problematic smartphone use",,,,,,,,,,"Adelhardt, Z., Markus, S., Eberle, T., Teenagers’ reaction on the long-lasting separation from smartphones, anxiety and fear of missing out (2018) Smsociety '18: Proceedings of the 9Th International Conference on Social Media and Society, pp. 212-216. , ACM. https://doi.org/; Alt, D., College students’ academic motivation, media engagement and fear of missing out (2015) Computers in Human Behavior, 49, pp. 111-119. , https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chb.2015.02.057; Aluoja, A., Shlik, J., Vasar, V., Luuk, K., Leinsalu, M., Development and psychometric properties of the Emotional State Questionnaire, a self-report questionnaire for depression and anxiety (1999) Nordic Journal of Psychiatry, 53 (6), pp. 443-449. , https://doi.org/10.1080/080394899427692; Andone, I., Błaszkiewicz, K., Eibes, M., Trendafilov, B., Markowetz, A., Montag, C., How age and gender affect smartphone usage (2016) Ubicomp '16: Proceedings of the 2016 ACM International Joint Conference on Pervasive and Ubiquitous Computing: Adjunct, pp. 9-12. , https://doi.org/10.1145/2968219.2971451; Ashton, J.J., Beattie, R.M., Screen time in children and adolescents: Is there evidence to guide parents and policy?

This fame-valuation is a concern for scholars, educators, and parents as it has been linked with teen self-focused aspirations, narcissism, and materialism. This rise in the value of fame has been linked to two trends: teens' increased attraction to celebrities and their use of social networking sites (SNSs). SNSs have changed the landscape of celebrity media presence compared to traditional media and enable a shift in balance between a professional and personal focus in the celebrity's brand image. Such a balance might have implications for the relationships audiences form with celebrities and, by extension, for adolescent fame-valuation. The current study examines the SNS (Facebook and Instagram) posts of teen-favored celebrities in order to map the characteristics of the messages to which adolescents are heavily exposed, that might reinforce their fascination with fame. The study is based on a content analysis of 1,075 posts by 24 teen-favored local and foreign celebrities in Israel. The study finds that celebrities' SNS posts lack depth in personal self-disclosure and are rather strongly focused on their professional lives – job-related activities, achievements, and self-promotion. Though SNSs present limited gatekeeping restrictions, celebrities choose to present a controlled image of themselves that is unprovocative, as evident in their promoted values, exhibited lifestyle, and physical representation. © 2007-2020 Cyberpsychology: Journal of Psychosocial Research on Cyberspace.","Adolescents; Celebrities; Fame-valuation; Parasocial relationships; Social networking sites",,,,,,,,,,"Ampong, G.O.A., Mensah, A., Adu, A.S.Y., Addae, J.A., Omoregie, O.K., Ofori, K.S., Examining self-disclosure on social networking sites: A flow theory and privacy perspective (2018) Behavioral Sciences, 8 (6). , https://doi.org/; Aubrey, J.S., Behm-Morawitz, E., Kim, K., Understanding the effects of MTV’s 16 and Pregnant on adolescent girls’ beliefs, attitudes, and behavioral intentions toward teen pregnancy (2014) Journal of Health Communication, 19 (10), pp. 1145-1160. , https://doi.org/10.1080/10810730.2013.872721; Auter, P.J., Psychometric: TV that talks back: An experimental validation of a parasocial interaction scale (1992) Journal of Broadcasting & Electronic Media, 36 (2), pp. 173-181. , https://doi.org/10.1080/08838159209364165; Baruh, L., Cemalcilar, Z., When more is more?

An online link was published on social media, asking participants who meet the research criteria to complete several questionnaires. About 30% of the participants reported sending sexual messages, and almost 32% reported that others, mainly strangers, asked them to send nude or semi-nude photos. Furthermore, sexting was more common among high-school students than among middle-school students, and asking another person to send nude or semi-nude photos was more common among boys than among girls. Lower parental social control was related to increased likelihood of sexting, and higher perception of permissive parenting style was associated with asking someone else to send nude or semi-nude photos. These findings shed light on sexting among adolescents in Israel. Moreover, the findings show that adolescents do not report sexting either to parents or to other significant adults in their lives, such as teachers or other educational staff at school. The article concludes with implications for educators and educational counselors in view of these findings. © 2007-2020 Cyberpsychology: Journal of Psychosocial Research on Cyberspace.","Adolescence; Internet; Parenting style; Sexting; Social control",,,,,,,,,,"Agustina, J.R., Understanding cyber victimization: Digital architectures and the disinhibition effect (2015) International Journal of Cyber Criminology, 9 (1), pp. 35-54. , http://dx.doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.22239; Anderson, M., (2015) Technology Device Ownership: 2015.

Specifically, this study assessed how wishful identification with hacker characters may contribute to individuals’ perception of hacking behaviors. One-hundred forty-nine North American participants were recruited using MTurk.com. Participants reported (1) their exposure to general media and perceived identification with a fictional hacker character, and (2) their perceived risks, payoffs, and estimated willingness of others to engage in hacker behaviors regarding a specific call to hack. Additionally, this research examined differences in the effects of media exposure on hacking likelihood between two types of hacks: financial hacking attacks and hacktivism attacks. Results show (1) that perceived payoffs of hacking, but not perceived risks, predict individuals’ estimation of hacker behaviors, (2) a significant and positive indirect effect between media exposure and estimation of others’ willingness to hack passes through wishful identification and perceived payoffs of hacking attacks, and (3) no significant differences in the above relationships between the two types of hacks. Together, these findings highlight that media exposure may increase positive perceptions of hackers and in turn increase the perception of pervasiveness and legitimacy of engaging in hacking behaviors. © 2007-2020 Cyberpsychology.","Computer crimes; Cyber attacks; Game theory; Hacking; Hacktivism; Wishful identification",,,,,,,,,,"Alberici, I.A., Milesi, P., Malfermo, P., Marzana, D., Canfora, R., Comparing social movements and political parties' activism: The psychosocial predictors of collective action and the role of the internet (2012) 1° TAISP (Theory, Action and Impact of Social Protest), pp. 3-4. , Interdisciplinary Conference, Punctum Books.0; Alpcan, T., Basar, T., A game theoretic approach to decision and analysis in network intrusion detection (2003) Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Decision and Control, 3, pp. 2595-2600. , IEEE; Violence & youth: Psychology’s response (1993) Volume I: Summary Report of the American Psychological Association Commission on Violence and Youth, , https://www.apa.org/pi/prevent-violence/resources/violence-youth.pdf; Andison, F.S., TV violence and viewer aggression: A cumulation of study results 1956-1976 (1977) Public Opinion Quarterly, 41 (3), pp. 314-331. , https://doi.org/10.1086/268390; Ayres, J., Hopf, T., Visualization: Reducing speech anxiety and enhancing performance (1992) Communication Reports, 5 (1), pp. 1-10. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/08934219209367538; Ayres, J., Hopf, T.S., Visualization: A means of reducing speech anxiety (1985) Communication Education, 34 (4), pp. 318-323. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03634528509378623; Ayres, J., Hopf, T.S., The long‐term effect of visualization in the classroom: A brief research report (1990) Communication Education, 39 (1), pp. 75-78. , https://doi.org/10.1080/03634529009378788; Barber, R., Hackers profiled – Who are they and what are their motivations?

This is particularly important for children who undergo painful and stressful medical treatments. The main aim of the present study was to examine whether the type of VR distraction had an effect on reducing pain and stress in children during a short blood sampling treatment, and to investigate the effectiveness of mobile VR. Fifty-seven patients of a pediatric nephrology clinic (Mage = 12, range: 7–17) participated in a between-group experimental design study. Participants in the treatment group (active vs passive VR) underwent a venipuncture procedure with VR distraction. Mobile VR (Samsung gear) was used in this study. Participants in the active VR experimental condition played a game based on the multiple object tracking task paradigm. In the passive VR experimental condition, participants watched a film similar to the presented game. All participants rated their pain and stress levels on the Visual Analogue Scale and completed a short questionnaire. Both VR groups reported significantly lower pain and stress intensity than the control group. When comparing the two experimental groups, no statistically significant differences were found, although participants differed in their level of perceived pain and stress, with greater benefits in the active VR. The present study focused on comparing the effect sizes of active and passive VR interventions. Additionally, the study confirmed feasibility of using Multiple Object Tracking paradigm as a method of attention distraction in VR. © 2007-2020 Cyberpsychology: Journal of Psychosocial Research on Cyberspace.","Acute care; Analgesia; Children; Pain; Virtual reality",,,,,,"2017/01/X/HS6/01935","The project was supported by funds from the Polish National Science 2017/01/X/HS6/01935 to Joanna Piskorz).",,,"Allison, D., Wills, B., Bowman, D., Wineman, J., Hodges, L.F., The virtual reality gorilla exhibit (1997) IEEE Computer Graphics and Applications, 17 (6), pp. 30-38. , https://doi.org/10.1109/38.626967; Alvarez, G.A., Scholl, B.J., How does attention select and track spatially extended objects?

Cyberbullying is thus a major challenge for public health. This study examines the prevalence of cyberbullying and explores the psychological characteristics of adolescents who have experienced cyberbullying. The sample consisted of 4531 Norwegian graduates in high school, age 18–21. The following psychological characteristics were investigated: self-harm, suicide attempts, antisocial behavior, anxiety and depression. Three mutually exclusive groups of cyberbullying were compared: 1) cybervictims, 2) cyberbullies and 3) cyberbully-victims. Participants involved in cyberbullying were further compared to those not involved. The prevalence of cyberbullying in this study was 5 %. There were no significant differences between cyberbullies, cybervictims and cyberbully-victims on any of the psychological variables, except for fewer reported suicide attempts in cyberbullies compared to cybervictims and cyberbully-victims. Late adolescents involved in cyberbullying did however report significantly more anxiety, depression, self-harm, suicide attempts and antisocial behavior, compared to those not involved. Thus, late adolescents involved in cyberbullying struggle more with psychological problems than non-involved adolescents. Increased knowledge about the characteristics of cyberbullies, cybervictims and cyberbully-victims could contribute to better detection and earlier identification of those involved in cyberbullying. This knowledge can further help understand more of the potential psychological vulnerability factors and consequences of cyberbullying, which could be used to optimize preventive measures and treatment. © 2007-2020 Cyberpsychology: Journal of Psychosocial Research on Cyberspace.","Antisocial behavior; Anxiety; Cyberbully; Cybervictim; Depression; Suicide",,,,,,"Nova","The authors wish to thank The Norwegian Social Research Institute (NOVA) and all the students that participated in this survey.",,,"Aboujaoude, E., Savage, M.W., Starcevic, V., Salame, W.O., Cyberbullying: Review of an old problem gone viral (2015) Journal of Adolescent Health, 57 (1), pp. 10-18. , https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jadohealth.2015.04.011; Bakken, A., (2018) Ungdata.

Because intimate partner cyber aggression victimization (C-IPV) has received less research attention than IP-IPV, it is important to learn whether such victimization experiences are similar to in-person victimization experiences in terms of their associations with maladaptive functioning or whether they comprise a unique form of IPV. The study also explores strain as a potential mediator of the link between IPV victimization and maladaptive behavior. A sample of undergraduate students aged 18-25 who were in intimate relationships during the past year participated in a voluntary and anonymous online survey (n = 540). Results signaled that C-IPV and IP-IPV shared similar correlates (e.g. depression, substance use, and antisocial behavior) and C-IPV was linked with more forms of maladaptive behavior than certain types of in-person IPV victimization (e.g., sexual and physical) experiences. Results indicated partial support for the predicted mediation. Males were also at higher risk for engaging in substance use and antisocial behavior across all models. The study suggests that harmful electronic exchanges may have adverse consequences for young adults. As such, services providers and educators addressing the issue of IPV should tailor prevention and intervention strategies in a way that is inclusive of cyber aggression and considers it a public health concern. © 2007-2020 Cyberpsychology:.","Antisocial behavior; Cyber aggression; Electronic aggression; Intimate partner violence; Strain theory; Substance use",,,,,,,,,,"Agnew, R., Foundation for a general strain theory of crime and delinquency (1992) Criminology, 30 (1), pp. 47-88; Agnew, R., Building on the foundation of general strain theory: Specifying the types of strain most likely to lead to crime and delinquency (2001) Journal of Research in Crime & Delinquency, 38 (4), pp. 319-361. , https://doi.org/10.1177/0022427801038004001; Arnett, J.J., Emerging adulthood: A theory of development from the late teens through the early twenties (2000) American Psychologist, 55 (5), pp. 469-480. , https://doi.org/10.1037/0003-066X.55.5.469; Arria, A.M., Caldeira, K.M., Bugbee, B.A., Vincent, K.B., O’Grady, K.E., Marijuana use trajectories during college predict health outcomes nine years post-matriculation (2016) Drug and Alcohol Dependence, 159, pp. 158-165. , https://doi.org/10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2015.12.009; Baron, R.M., Kenny, D.A., The moderator-mediator variable distinction in social psychological research: Conceptual, strategic and statistical considerations (1986) Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 51 (6), pp. 1173-1182. , https://doi.org/10.1037/0022-3514.51.6.1173; Baum, K., Catalano, S.M., Rand, M.R., Rose, K., (2009) Stalking Victims in the United States, , http://bjs.ojp.usdoj.gov/index.cfm?ty=pbdetail&iid=1211, Bureau of Justice Statistics; Bauman, S., Newman, M.L., Testing assumptions about cyberbullying: Perceived distress associated with acts of conventional and cyber bullying (2013) Psychology of Violence, 3 (1), pp. 27-38. , https://doi.org/10.1037/a0029867; Bennett, D.C., Guran, E.L., Ramos, M.C., Margolin, G., College students' electronic victimization in friendships and dating relationships: Anticipated distress and associations with risky behaviors (2011) Violence and Victims, 26 (4), pp. 410-429. , https://doi.org/10.1891/0886-6708.26.4.410; Black, M.C., Basile, K.C.B., Breiding, M.J., Smith, S.G., Walters, M.L., Merrick, M.T., Chen, J., Stevens, M.R., The National Intimate Partner and Sexual Violence Survey (NISVS): 2010 summary report (2011) National Center for Injury Prevention and Control, , https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/pdf/nisvs_report2010-a.pdf, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; Bocij, P., (2004) Cyberstalking: Harassment in the Internet Age, , Praeger Publishers; Borrajo, E., Gámez-Guadix, M., Pereda, N., Calvete, E., The development and validation of the cyber dating abuse questionnaire among young couples (2015) Computers in Human Behavior, 48, pp. 358-365. , https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chb.2015.01.063; Breiding, M.J., Chen, J., Black, M.C., Intimate partner violence in the United States – 2010.

Canadian parent-child dyads (N = 102) completed a survey where parents reported their perceptions of their child or adolescent’s involvement in cyber aggression, cyber victimization, and witnessing cyber aggression, while children and adolescents (ages 8–16) reported their own experiences. Mean difference scores were calculated to examine parental awareness. The results showed that parents of children in elementary school underestimated their participation in cyber aggression, whereas parents of adolescents in high school overestimated their participation in cyber aggression. In addition, parents of adolescents who did not use restrictive mediation underestimated the extent to which their adolescent witnessed cyber aggression. Overall, this study highlights the importance of parenting practices and parental knowledge of negative online behaviour across childhood and adolescence. © 2007-2020 Cyberpsychology: Journal of Psychosocial Research on Cyberspace |.","Bystander; Cyberbullying; Parental awareness; Parental mediation; Restrictive mediation; Victimization",,,,,,,,,,"Ahmad, N., Mokhtar, U.A., Hood, Z., Tiun, S., Jambari, D.I., Parental awareness on cyber threats using social media (2019) Jurnal Komunikasi: Malaysian Journal of Communication, 35 (2), pp. 485-498. , https://doi.org/10.17576/JKMJC-2019-3502-29; Anderson, M., A majority of teens have experienced some form of cyberbullying (2018) Pew Researcher Center: Internet & Technology., , https://www.pewinternet.org/2018/09/27/a-majority-of-teens-have-experienced-some-form-of-cyberbullying/, (, September 27); Ang, R.P., Adolescent cyberbullying: A review of characteristics, prevention and intervention strategies (2015) Aggression and Violent Behavior, 25, pp. 35-42. , https://doi.org/10.1016/j.avb.2015.07.011; Ang, R.P., Chong, W.H., Chye, S., Huan, V.S., Loneliness and generalized problematic Internet use: Parents’ perceived knowledge of adolescents’ online activities as a moderator (2012) Computers in Human Behavior, 28 (4), pp. 1342-1347. , https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chb.2012.02.019; Barlett, C.P., Fennel, M., Examining the relation between parental ignorance and youths’ cyberbullying perpetration (2018) Psychology of Popular Media Culture, 7 (4), pp. 547-560. , https://doi.org/10.1037/ppm0000139; Belsey, B., (2019) Cyberbullying: An Emerging Threat to the “always on” Generation, , http://www.billbelsey.com/?p=1827, March 24, Bill Belsey; Bybee, C.R., Robinson, D., Turow, J., Determinants of parental guidance of children's television viewing for a special subgroup: Mass media scholars (1982) Journal of Broadcasting, 26 (3), pp. 697-710. , https://doi.org/10.1080/08838158209364038; Byrne, S., Katz, S.J., Lee, T., Linz, D., McIlrath, M., Peers, predators, and porn: Predicting parental underestimation of children's risky online experiences (2014) Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication, 19 (2), pp. 215-231. , https://doi.org/10.1111/jcc4.12040; Cerna, A., Machackova, H., Dedkova, L., Whom to trust: The role of mediation and perceived harm in support seeking by cyberbullying victims (2016) Children & Society, 30 (4), pp. 265-277. , https://doi.org/10.1111/chso.12136; Chang, F.-C., Chiu, C.-H., Miao, N.-F., Chen, P.-H., Lee, C.-M., Chiang, J.-T., Pan, Y.-C., The relationship between parental mediation and Internet addiction among adolescents, and the association with cyberbullying and depression (2015) Comprehensive Psychiatry, 57, pp. 21-28. , https://doi.org/10.1016/j.comppsych.2014.11.013; Chng, G.S., Liau, A., Khoo, A., Li, D., Parental mediation and cyberbullying – A longitudinal study (2014) Annual Review of Cybertherapy and Telemedicine, 12, pp. 98-102. , http://www.arctt.info/volume-12-summer-2014; Cho, C.-H., Cheon, H.J., Children's exposure to negative Internet content: Effects of family context (2005) Journal of Broadcasting & Electronic Media, 49 (4), pp. 488-509. , https://doi.org/10.1207/s15506878jobem4904_8; Clark, L.S., Parental mediation theory for the digital age (2011) Communication Theory, 21 (4), pp. 323-343. , https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1468-2885.2011.01391.x; Daneels, R., Vanwynsberghe, H., Mediating social media use: Connecting parents’ mediation strategies and social media literacy (2017) Cyberpsychology: Journal of Psychosocial Research on Cyberspace, 11 (3). , http://dx.doi.org/10.5817/CP2017-3-5; Dehue, F., Bolman, C., Völlink, T., Cyberbullying: Youngsters' experiences and parental perception (2008) Cyberpsychology & Behavior, 11 (2), pp. 217-223. , https://doi.org/10.1089/cpb.2007.0008; Dorr, A., Kovaric, P., Doubleday, C., Parent-child coviewing of television (1989) Journal of Broadcasting & Electronic Media, 33 (1), pp. 35-51. , https://doi.org/10.1080/08838158909364060; Ho, S.S., Chen, L., Ng, A.P.Y., Comparing cyberbullying perpetration on social media between primary and secondary school students (2017) Computers & Education, 109, pp. 74-84. , https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compedu.2017.02.004; (2013) Bullies Taking to Social Networking as Teens Become More Mobile, , https://www.ipsos.com/en-ca/bullies-taking-social-networking-teens-become-more-mobile; Katz, S.J., Lee, T., Byrne, S., Predicting parent-child differences in perceptions of how children use the Internet for help with homework, identity development, and health Information (2015) Journal of Broadcasting & Electronic Media, 59 (4), pp. 574-602. , https://doi.org/10.1080/08838151.2015.1093479; Leduc, K., Caivano, O., van De Loo, E., Talwar, V., (2018) Does It Make a Difference?

Women from two different samples (MTurk and university) were randomly assigned to recall a high-versus low-power experience, view real-world events of sexism, and then complete questionnaires assessing endorsement of social media activism, positive affect, and collective action intentions. A dual moderated mediation analyses at the second stage of mediation showed equivalency across two samples, at which point the single moderated mediation model was tested on the combined sample. The model was significant, such that among those in the high-power condition, endorsing social media activism was associated with greater positive affect, which in turn predicted greater collective action intentions. Among those in the low-power condition, however, this indirect effect was not significant. This study provides counter-evidence to the ‘slacktivism’ critique, contributes to theories of collective action, power and their integration, and identifies a possible intervention to enhance the effectiveness of social media activism. © 2007-2019 Cyberpsychology: Journal of Psychosocial Research on Cyberspace.","Activism; Collective action; Power; Sexism; Slacktivism; Social media",,,,,,,,,,"Adkins, M., Brashers, D.E., The power of language in computer-mediated groups (1995) Management Communication Quarterly, 8, pp. 289-322. , https://doi.org/10.1177/0893318995008003002; Ajzen, I., From intentions to actions: A theory of planned behavior (1985) Action-Control: From Cognitions to Behavior, pp. 11-39. , J.

In the research literature, little is known about the role played by parenting in relation to children’s PIU in Arab societies. One hundred and eighty male adolescents whose age ranges from 12 to 16 (M = 13.92, SD = 1.42) reported their internet behavior and their parents’ parenting styles. Controlling for the participants’ age, family size, and grades, parenting styles explained 24% of the variance in PIU scores, with authoritarian parenting being the only significant unique predictor. A further analysis of covariance revealed that adolescents who perceived their parents as authoritative scored lower than their counterparts in PIU. Our findings suggest that while Israeli-Arab male adolescents might benefit from authoritative parenting at home, it is the parental authoritarian practices and behaviors per se that should be targeted as part of PIU intervention and prevention efforts. © 2007-2019 Cyberpsychology: Journal of Psychosocial Research on Cyberspace.","Adolescents;

Yet, they can also be somewhat differentiated. Adopting person-centered approaches, studies showed that multiple classes of peer victimization are distinguishable. In particular, this study analyzed the differences in Internet use, Internet motives and behavior and ethical media use of adolescents who are victimized only (or mainly) online (i.e., “cyber-victims”), their peers who are victimized at school (“traditional victims”), students who are frequently victimized both offline and online (“dual victims”), and students who are not victimized. A sample of 1377 Italian adolescents (49.5% females, age M = 16.13, SD = 1.27) completed self-report questionnaires of traditional and peer cyber-victimization and a variety of Internet-related measures. Latent profile analysis yielded four distinct groups: non-victims (79.6% of the sample), traditional victims (9.2%), cyber-victims (9.1%), and dual victims (2.1%). Among the four groups, dual victims, that is, adolescents who are frequently victimized both at school and online, showed the most problematic use of information and communication technologies (ICT). Dual victims and cyber-victims also reported to engage more frequently than the other groups in a variety of Internet activities (e.g., role-playing games and visiting adult sites). Traditional victims reported more coping and conformity motives for using Internet compared to non-victims and, in the latter case, also to cyber-victims. The current findings may help to better understand the link between traditional victimization and peer cyber-victimization with adolescent’s use of information and communication technologies and may inform prevention and educational programs about positive use of new technologies among adolescents. © 2007-2019 Cyberpsychology: Journal of Psychosocial Research on Cyberspace.","Cyber-victimization; Internet use motives; Online risks; Problematic Internet use; Traditional victimization",,,,,,,,,,"Asparouhov, T., Muthén, B., Auxiliary variables in mixture modeling: Using the BCH method in Mplus to estimate a distal outcome model and an arbitrary secondary model (2014) Mplus Web Notes, 21 (2), pp. 1-22; Aufderheide, P., (1993) Media Literacy. a Report of the National Leadership Conference on Media Literacy, , Queenstown, MD: The Aspen Institute; Bakk, Z., Vermunt, J.K., Robustness of stepwise latent class modeling with continuous distal outcomes (2016) Structural Equation Modeling: A Multidisciplinary Journal, 23, pp. 20-31. , https://doi.org/10.1080/10705511.2014.955104; Bandura, A., Social learning theory of aggression (1978) Journal of Communication, 28 (3), pp. 12-29. , https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1460-2466.1978.tb01621.x; Barboza, G.E., The association between school exclusion, delinquency and subtypes of cyber-and F2F-victimizations: Identifying and predicting risk profiles and subtypes using latent class analysis (2015) Child Abuse & Neglect, 39, pp. 109-122. , https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chiabu.2014.08.007; Bauman, S., Cross, D., Walker, J., (2013) Routledge Monographs in Mental Health.

Participants viewed a mock Yelp.com webpage that displayed information about a local business together with four users’ comments. Consistent with self-categorization theory, viewers adopted their ingroup’s comments, but only when they identified highly with their ingroup. Further, a central message that was juxtaposed with users’ comments and shaped their focus, determined the degree of ingroup identification; viewers were more likely to identify with their ingroup when the central message dealt with an outgroup-typed (vs. ingroup-typed) topic. Finally, although an outgroup-typed central message elicited stereotypical beliefs of the outgroup’s expertise, such beliefs failed to predict viewers’ attitudes, thus lending support to the ingroup identification explanation. © 2019, Masaryk University.

Given the differences and similarities between cyber-victimization and in-person victimization, research needs to examine whether prior understanding of coping with in-person victimization applies to coping with cyber-victimization. The purpose of this study was to compare the use and effectiveness of coping strategies in both in-person and cyber-victimization contexts in a sample of adolescents (N = 321; 11-15 years old) in the United States. Results indicated that adolescents tend to use more strategies overall to cope with in-person victimization than cyber-victimization, and female adolescents used more distraction and social support from friends than male adolescents. Adolescents also used problem solving, social support from friends and family/adults, and distraction more frequently than distancing and retaliation; when problem solving was used, adolescents felt positive about the outcome, regardless of victimization type. The use of retaliation was negatively associated with coping efficacy for both situations. Further, social support from friends and social support from family/adults were associated with coping efficacy for cyber-victimization. Our findings can be used to inform interventionists about which strategies adolescents perceive work best to cope with cyber-victimization. © 2007-2019 Cyberpsychology: Journal of Psychosocial Research on Cyberspace.","Bullying; Coping; Coping efficacy; Cyberbullying; Victimization",,,,,,"Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, NICHD","Sarah E.

Based on this, we predicted that video game interactivity renders players susceptible to new ideas of actions performed in a video game, by causing them to conceive the actions as concrete details. In a 2 (medium type: interactive vs. non-interactive) x 2 (meaning of hunting: beneficial vs. harmful) between-subjects experiment (N = 111), participants played or watched a hunting simulation game, then expressed their agreement on a news article reporting either the benefit or harm of hunting. The interactivity group, compared to the non-interactivity group, described their game experience as concrete actions, indicating that they construed actions as concrete identities. Further, these concrete identities led to greater agreement with the news article regardless whether benefit or harm of hunting was reported. These results suggest an indirect effect of interactivity on participants’ susceptibility to a new idea. Implications for using the mental representation approach in media-effect studies were discussed. © 2007-2019 Cyberpsychology: Journal of Psychosocial Research on Cyberspace.","Action-identity; Interactivity; Mental representation video game; Susceptibility",,,,,,"NRF-2017S1A3A2066149

This study is an ancillary analysis of data from a randomized trial of sixty-one adolescents assigned to one of four exergames to play in their home for 4 weeks. Parents provided baseline demographic information. Adolescents completed the MEPI at the end of week 1 and completed game logs to record exergame play over the four weeks. Factor analysis with varimax rotation was used to determine the number of distinct composite factors within the MEPI. Cronbach’s alpha assessed internal consistency of each resulting factor. Separate regression models were used to examine the association of each factor with total game play over 4 weeks. Twenty-two of 28 items were retained in the MEPI to measure five distinct constructs of motivation: sensory immersion/flow, user control, goals of the game, performance feedback, and challenge/difficulty. Sensory immersion/flow and user control were each significantly associated with total game play. Evidence of construct validity for the MEPI was demonstrated. The MEPI appears to be a promising tool to assess players’ motivation for exergaming, an important contributor to sustained physically active game play. © 2007-2019 Cyberpsychology: Journal of Psychosocial Research on Cyberspace.","Motivation;

The said gap is explored in the present paper by means of a systematic literature review of how theories of self-schema and transformative learning have been used thus far in researching behaviour change support systems. Tailoring content and persuasive strategies to some end-user traits is an acknowledged avenue in the persuasive technology field, but what identifiable traits beyond needs, interests, personality, or context can be identified and used in the pursuit of systems that are increasingly more relevant to their users? Various databases were searched for peer-reviewed articles, and the research contributions were analysed against the Persuasive Systems Design Model and Outcome/Change Design Matrix. The results show that neither theory has been used extensively for researching behaviour change support systems; yet, a closer look at the records offers feasible approaches for addressing the intention-behaviour gap. Both SST and TLT emerge as worth investigating as regards identifying and influencing attitude and self-perception level factors in persuasion. © 2007-2019 Cyberpsychology: Journal of Psychosocial Research on Cyberspace.","Behaviour change; Literature review; Persuasive technology; Self-schema theory; Transformative learning theory",,,,,,,,,,"Abraham, C., Michie, S., A taxonomy of behavior change techniques used in interventions (2008) Health Psychology, 27, pp. 379-387. , https://doi.org/10.1037/0278-6133.27.3.379; Ajzen, I., From intentions to actions: A theory of planned behavior (1985) Action Control: From Cognition to Behavior, pp. 11-35. , J.

Studies have considered the effects of this form of behaviour for cognitive control ability, with findings suggesting that chronic media multitasking is associated with reduced inhibitory control. In this study we advance knowledge in this domain by investigating differences in the attention distribution strategies of high and low media multitaskers (HMMs and LMMs) through a simple, two-dimensional game. 1 063 university students completed a web-based survey concerning their media multitasking behaviour and played the 2D game. Contributing to the ecological validity of the study the game was played within the respondent’s web-browser, as part of the survey, at a time and place (and on a computer) of their choosing. During gameplay one of two different banners, both irrelevant to the game, were displayed adjacent to the game. No instructions were provided in relation to the banners. Our analysis considered respondents’ performance in the game in relation to both their media multitasking and the content of the banner displayed. Our findings suggest that while HMMs attend to distracting stimuli independent of their content or salience, LMMs are more selective. This selectivity enables improved primary task performance when distracting stimuli are deemed unimportant.

Drawing on research about attributions of poverty, subjective well-being, and relative income, this experimental study assesses the effects of an online poverty simulation (entitled Spent) on participants’ beliefs, attitudes, and actions. Results show that, compared with a control group, Spent players donated marginally more money to a charity serving the poor and expressed higher support for policies benefitting the poor, but were less likely to take immediate political action by signing an online petition to support a higher minimum wage. Spent players also expressed greater subjective well-being than the control group, but this was not associated with increased policy support or donations. Spent players who experienced greater presence (perceived realism of the simulation) had higher levels of empathy, which contributed to attributing poverty to structural causes and support for anti-poverty policies. We draw conclusions for theory about the psychological experience of playing online poverty simulations, and for how they could be designed to stimulate charity and support for anti-poverty policies. © 2007-2019 Cyberpsychology: Journal of Psychosocial Research on Cyberspace.","Empathy; Poverty; Presence; Simulations; Subjective well-being",,,,,,"Santa Clara University, SCU","This research was supported through a University Research Grant, Santa Clara University.",,,"Aknin, L.B., Barrington-Leigh, C.P., Dunn, E.W., Helliwell, J.F., Burns, J., Biswas-Diener, R., Norton, M.I., Prosocial spending and well-being: Cross-cultural evidence for a psychological universal (2013) Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 104, pp. 635-652. , https://doi.org/10.1037/a0031578; Andreoni, J., Giving with impure altruism: Applications to charity and Ricardian equivalence (1989) Journal of Political Economy, 97, pp. 1447-1458. , https://doi.org/10.1086/261662; Annetta, L.A., Minogue, J.M., Holmes, S.Y., Cheng, M.-T., Investigating the impact of video games on high school students’ engagement and learning about genetics (2009) Computers & Education, 53, pp. 74-85. , https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compedu.2008.12.020; Bachen, C.M., Hernández-Ramos, P., Raphael, C., Waldron, A., How do presence, flow, and character identification affect players’ empathy and interest in learning from a serious computer game?

This study focuses on adolescents’ perceptions of the impact of digital media on jealousy, conflict, and control within their romantic relationships. Twelve focus group interviews were conducted, among 55 secondary school students (ngirls = 28; 51% girls) between the ages of 15 and 18 years (Mage = 16.60 years; SDage = 1.21), in the Dutch-speaking community of Belgium. The respondents identified several sources of jealousy within their romantic relationships, such as online pictures of the romantic partner with others and online messaging with others. Adolescents identified several ways in which romantic partners would react when experiencing feelings of jealousy, such as contacting the person they saw as a threat or looking up the other person’s social media profiles. Along with feelings of jealousy, respondents described several monitoring behaviors, such as reading each other’s e-mails or accessing each other’s social media accounts. Adolescents also articulated several ways that they curated their social media to avoid conflict and jealousy within their romantic relationships. For instance, they adapted their social media behavior by avoiding the posting of certain pictures, or by ceasing to comment on certain content of others. The discussion section includes suggestions for future research and implications for practice, such as the need to incorporate information about e-safety into sexual and relational education and the need to have discussions with adolescents, about healthy boundaries for communication within their friendships and romantic relationships. © 2007-2019 Cyberpsychology: Journal of Psychosocial Research on Cyberspace.","Cyber dating abuse; Digital media; Jealousy; Monitoring behaviors; Social media",,,,,,,"The Research of Joris Van Ouytsel is supported by the Research Foundation - Flanders.","Joris Van Ouytsel, PhD., is a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Antwerp.

However, due to methodological and theoretical problems, evidence for this ‘right-shift’ hypothesis is currently mixed. To address these issues, we introduce for the first-time search volume indices (SVI) analysis to the study of public opinion dynamics by assessing the effects of exposure to the 2015 Paris terror attacks, with a focus on equalitarian values related searches in the French cyberspace. Consistent with the ‘right-shift’ hypothesis, we demonstrate that online collective threat salience (SVI for the word ‘terror attack’) predicts significant decreases in equalitarian values SVI (e.g. ‘equality’) 6 weeks later, but not in non-equalitarian values SVI (e.g. ‘liberty’). Mixed-model analyses of SVI for the period 2012-2017 confirmed these results by showing both decrease in equalitarian values SVI and no change in non-equalitarian values SVI after 2015. These findings corroborate the ‘right-shift’ hypothesis at the societal level using ecological-behavioural measures of public opinion and demonstrate the value of SVI analysis for theory-testing in political psychology. © 2007-2019 Cyberpsychology: Journal of Psychosocial Research on Cyberspace.","Anti-equalitarian; Big data; Right-shift; Search volume indices; Terror attacks",,,,,,,"The authors wished to thank the editor and the three anonymous reviewers for their invaluable contribution and thorough scrutiny on the present manuscript.

Both the vulnerability of adolescents and the lack of sponsorship disclosures raise concerns about the ethics of influencer marketing. Through focus groups (20 participants, aged 12 to 16), we investigated adolescents’ awareness and understanding of the presence of persuasive content in influencer videos (i.e. conceptual advertising literacy), their moral and evaluative perceptions of this content (i.e. attitudinal and moral advertising literacy), their perceptions of disclosures, and the role of disclosures in their evaluations of the sponsoring brand and the influencer. Results show that adolescents are accepting of sponsorships and show compassion toward the influencers instead of having a critical perspective. Moreover, disclosures are appreciated as long as they do not disturb the editorial–commercial balance of the sponsored video. However, when a disclosure does disturb this balance, adolescents report reactance and negative brand evaluations. The results contribute to the theoretical understanding of adolescents’ advertising literacy of video influencer marketing and provide practical guidelines for establishing disclosure policies. © 2007-2019 Cyberpsychology: Journal of Psychosocial Research on Cyberspace.","Adolescents; AdVertising literacy; Disclosures; Influencer marketing; Persuasion knowledge; Sponsored content",,,,,,"Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek, NWO

In doing so, this study explores the representation of digital consumerism, defined as development of consumer empowerment and vulnerability in digital markets, which appears as a paradigm to ensure balanced market environments for both consumers and companies (Kucuk, 2016). In particular, this study investigates cultural differences in the representation of digital consumerism in online product reviews by comparing the online product reviews from U.S. and South Korea. Additionally, message strategies employed in the online product reviews were also examined in respect of digital consumerism while comparing the two cultures. A discourse analysis on a total of 400 online product reviews (i.e., 200 from U.S., 200 from South Korea) was conducted to understand how digital consumerism can be constructed. The results indicated significant cultural differences between the U.S. and South Korea based on online consumer powers manifested in the content of online product reviews as well as message strategies adopted to express digital consumerism. In the U.S., economic, technologic, and social power were more frequently observed in online product reviews compared to legal power; In contrast, in South Korea, economic power was the most frequently observed, followed by social and technologic power. In terms of message strategies, transformational messages were dominantly used to express digital consumerism in online product reviews from both countries, whereas each type of online consumer powers was expressed differently in the U.S. and South Korea by adopting different message strategies.

Therefore, the current study conducted a three-level, between-subjects experiment (advertising literacy intervention: control condition versus informational booklet versus serious mini-game platform) to examine the effectiveness of advertising literacy interventions among adolescents (aged ten to sixteen). The results showed that an advertising literacy intervention (compared to no intervention) increased Belgian adolescents’ (N = 211, Mage = 13.22) perceived dispositional advertising literacy, and subsequently, their motivation to critically reflect on advertising. In addition, the advertising literacy serious mini-game platform (compared to the informational booklet) increased the experience of flow among the adolescents, which in turn positively affected enjoyment, and perceived learning. Perceived learning then further increased adolescents’ motivation to critically reflect on advertising and their motivation to interact with the learning materials. © 2007-2019 Cyberpsychology: Journal of Psychosocial Research on Cyberspace |.","Adolescents; AdVertising literacy; AdVertising literacy interVention; Learning outcomes; MotiVational outcomes; Serious mini-game platform; User experiences",,,,,,,,,,"Adams, B., Schellens, T., Valcke, M., Promoting adolescents’ moral adVertising literacy in secondary education (2017) Comunicar: Media Education Research Journal, 25 (52), pp. 93-103. , https://doi.org/10.3916/C52-2017-09; Admiraal, W., Huizenga, J., Akkerman, S., Ten Dam, G., The concept of flow in collaboratiVe game-based learning (2011) Computers in Human Behavior, 27, pp. 1185-1194. , https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chb.2010.12.013; An, S., Jin, H.S., Park, E.H., Children’s adVertising literacy for adVergames: Perception of the game as adVertising (2014) Journal of Advertising, 43, pp. 63-72. , https://doi.org/10.1080/00913367.2013.795123; Annetta, L.A., Minogue, J., Holmes, S.Y., Cheng, M.-T., InVestigating the impact of Video games on high school students’ engagement and learning about genetics (2009) Computers & Education, 53, pp. 74-85. , https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compedu.2008.12.020; Austin, E.W., Johnson, K.K., Immediate and delayed effects of media literacy training on third grader’s decision making for alcohol (1997) Health Communication, 9, pp. 323-349. , https://doi.org/10.1207/s15327027hc0904_3; Backlund, P., Hendrix, M., Educational games-are they worth the effort?

For this reason, regulators have been aiming to empower consumers to exercise more control over their data. Companies that collect and process data for personalized advertising are required to be transparent and among others, provide consumers with technical knowledge about the personalization process. At the same time, they have started offering settings to withdraw consent for processing data for personalization purposes by opting out from personalized advertising. However, such opt-out functions remain mostly unused. Thus, this study investigates first, if technical knowledge about personalization empowers consumers to use such opt-out functions and second, what mechanisms can explain the empowering impact of knowledge. Drawing on Rogers’ (1975) protection motivation theory (PMT) and applying an innovative combination of traditional (online experiment, N = 425, Mage = 48) and computational (online behavior tracking, N = 80, Mage = 48) research methods, the study shows that technical knowledge has no empowering effect on consumers by indirectly lowering opt-out motivation and behavior. The results also demonstrate that perceived severity and response efficacy increase motivation to opt-out, while positive attitude towards personalization and perceived self-efficacy lower it. Being one of the first studies to apply PMT to personalization context and computational methods to measure opt-out, it offers several important societal and theoretical implications regarding consumer empowerment and personalized advertising online. © 2007-2019 Cyberpsychology: Journal of Psychosocial Research on Cyberspace.","Computational research; Consumer empowerment; Consumer knowledge; Personalized digital adVertising; Protection motiVation theory",,,,,,"Universiteit van Amsterdam, UvA

Research indicates that passive Facebook use may also be related to a tendency to engage in social comparison with others. In addition, there is some evidence that this tendency is more prevalent in individuals high in the personality trait neuroticism. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationships between passive Facebook use, neuroticism, and social comparison orientation (SCO). In addition, we explored whether SCO mediates the potential relationship between neuroticism and passive Facebook use. In a cross-sectional study, 318 Estonian Facebook users completed the Multidimensional Scale of Facebook Use (to ascertain passive Facebook use), the Extra Short Big Five Personality Inventory, and the Iowa-Netherlands Comparison Orientation Scale. The results revealed positive bivariate-correlations between passive Facebook use, neuroticism, and SCO. In addition, SCO mediated the relationship between neuroticism and passive Facebook use. These findings suggest that people higher in neuroticism are more prone to social comparison, which is associated with passive Facebook use. These findings are discussed, and several directions for future research are provided. © 2019, Masaryk University.

One of the existing issues is the small effect sizes that showed that the traits outlined by the Five-Factor model are lacking the required specificity to predict specific behaviours such as SNS addiction. In light of this issue, the present research attempted to predict SNS addiction with the Dark Triad traits that have been linked to impulsivity that is central to the development of SNS addiction. In this study, a sample of 204 (Male = 77, 38%; Female = 124, 60%; Not mentioned = 3, 2%; M age = 22.94, SD age = 3.43) university students in Malaysia completed the Big Five Inventory, the Short Dark Triad, and the adapted Bergen Facebook Addiction Scale. Results indicated that SNS addiction was significantly predicted by the measured psychopathy of the Dark Triad. In predicting SNS addiction, the inclusion of the Dark Triad traits contributed significant amount of variance after controlling the Five-Factor model. Finally, the implications of the results were discussed in this manuscript. © 2018, Masaryk University.

This need can be fulfilled through two kinds of belongingness-related behaviours: information-seeking (using SNS to learn about others) and communication (using SNS to communicate with others). The present study aimed at examining the role of gender, personality traits and emotional competence on each of these two belongingness-related behaviours. A total of 995 self-selected Italian Internet users (67.1% women; age range: 18-56) participated in the study. Results showed that the two online behaviours are influenced by different variables. Among them, the most relevant appear to be emotional competences, as managing emotions reduces both behaviours, using emotions fosters communication, and understanding emotions decreases information-seeking. Extraversion plays a key role as well, promoting both behaviours in women and information-seeking in men, whereas openness to experiences is positively linked to viewing others’ profiles. Finally, men use social networking sites to communicate and express their opinions more often than women. Implications are discussed. © 2018, Masaryk University.

In Study 1, we used a survey method with a sample of college students (N = 232) and found that social media addiction was negatively associated with the students’ mental health and academic performance and that the relation between social media addiction and mental health was mediated by self-esteem. In Study 2, we developed and tested a two-stage self-help intervention program. We recruited a sample of college students (N = 38) who met criteria for social media addiction to receive the intervention. Results showed that the intervention was effective in reducing the students’ social media addiction and improving their mental health and academic efficiency. The current studies yielded original findings that contribute to the empirical database on social media addiction and that have important theoretical and practical implications. © 2018, Masaryk University.

To advance and strengthen the psychometric foundation of the PORS, the current study evaluated the measurement invariance of PORS across gender and age, two major demographic categories that can differentially affect how racism is perceived. Based on the framework of intersectionality, the salience and significance of social identities, such as gender and age, influence how racism is perceived with different meanings and interpretations. The current study examined data collected through an online survey from 946 racial/ethnic minority participants (59% women, mean age = 27.42) in the United States. Measurement invariance across gender (men and women) and age groups (ages 18 to 24, 25 to 39, and 40 to 64) was tested via comparison of a series of models with increasing constraints. Measurement invariance across configural, metric, and scalar models for age and gender was supported. Latent means were compared across gender and age groups. The results advance the psychometric property of the PORS as a general measure of online racism.

The objective of this randomized controlled study was to examine the effects of group-based dance exergaming on adolescent girls’ psychosocial health including enjoyment, subjective health, perceived peer support, and health-related quality of life. Forty-one adolescents with overweight/obesity were randomly assigned to a 12-week dance exergaming intervention or to a control group. Peer support, subjective health, and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) were assessed pre- and post-intervention, and intervention participants rated enjoyment after each exergaming session. Repeated measures analysis of covariance models controlling for age and baseline body mass index were used to examine condition differences. Results indicated that subjective health improved in the exergaming condition more than control (p = .02). Ratings of peer conflict after the intervention were significantly different by condition (p = .01), with peer conflict stabilizing in the exergaming group and worsening in the control group. There was no difference by condition for HRQOL. Enjoyment remained high throughout the intervention. In summary, group exergaming improved subjective health, stabilized peer conflict, and provided an enjoyable physical activity experience for overweight adolescent girls. © 2018, Masaryk University.

Images posted on social networking sites may also impact body satisfaction by portraying idealised standards of physical attractiveness promoted by peers. This study draws on self-determination theory to examine whether satisfaction of basic psychological needs (autonomy, competence, and relatedness) protects against the negative effect of viewing Facebook images depicting an ideal body type on body satisfaction. Female (n = 141) and male (n = 48) university students were randomly assigned to view either a body-ideal image or a travel image presented on a mock Facebook profile. Viewing body-ideal imagery resulted in significantly lower body satisfaction compared to viewing travel imagery (d = -0.37). Satisfaction of the needs for autonomy and competence predicted higher baseline body satisfaction; however, none of the psychological needs protected against the negative effect of viewing body-ideal imagery on body satisfaction. Limitations included brief exposure to a single Facebook image and use of a convenience sample. Future research may benefit from measuring body image-specific rather than general psychological need satisfaction to predict state changes in body satisfaction. © 2018, Masaryk University.

Research indicates that posting selfies may impact upon self esteem and that feedback in the form of ‘likes’ may change how young people feel about themselves. To date, however, most research has been cross sectional or qualitative limiting conclusions about causality. Further, it has taken place in non naturalistic environments, with no longer term follow up and limited outcome variables. This experimental study explored the impact of posting selfies and receiving feedback (‘likes’) on Instagram on broader aspects of the psychological well-being of young people. Participants (n = 59) aged 16-25 were randomly allocated to one of three conditions for a 7-day intervention (no selfie-posting; posting selfies without feedback; posting selfies with feedback) and completed measures at baseline, after the intervention and at one week follow up. ‘Likes’ were delivered through an app. The intervention had no impact on self-esteem or mood. Posting no selfies resulted in a greater improvement in appearance satisfaction over the study compared to posting selfies (regardless of feedback). In contrast, posting selfies with feedback resulted in a greater improvement in face satisfaction during the intervention although this dropped back to baseline by follow up. To conclude the impact of selfies may vary depending upon which outcome variable is measured and when. © 2018, Masaryk University.

Data were collected in probability samples among populations aged 60-75 years in Norway (N = 1271), Denmark (N = 1045), Belgium (N = 991), and Portugal (N = 509) using postal questionnaires. A total of 36% of men and 15% of women reported having used the Internet for sex and love purposes, most often to watch pornography. The use of the Internet for various love and sex purposes was higher in participants who had a partner, who had masturbation activity and who were satisfied with their current level of sexual activity. Multivariate logistic regression analyses showed that use of the Internet to find committed partners, watch pornography, buy sex products or seek information or advice was lower in Portuguese men than men in Norway, Denmark, and Belgium. Tailored websites to promote both sexuality and how to preserve a committed relationship are likely to prove important for the aging population. © 2018, Masaryk University.

Research reveals the relevant role played by bystanders in stopping bullying and cyberbullying. The aim of this work is to identify those factors which encourage or hamper the mobilisation of young bystanders under 20 years of age in instances of cyberbullying, through a systematic literature review spanning 2005 to 2016 in the databases Web of Science Core Collection and SciELO Citation Index. A total of 19 articles were analysed. We identified two types of factors. Firstly, there are contextual factors, which refer to the relationships at play, the interactions and the environment, and are grouped into the following categories: friendship, social environment, bystander effect, incident severity, action of other bystanders, request for assistance, evaluation of the situation, knowledge of effective strategies, characteristics of virtual environments, and fear of retaliation. Secondly, there are personal factors, referring to individual traits, categorised into: empathy, moral disengagement, self-efficacy, behavioural determinants, previous experience of bullying and cyberbullying, and demographic and socio-economic data. Of particular influence seem to be the factors of friendship and social context, as well as empathy, moral disengagement and self-efficacy. To formulate practical recommendations to guide the development of educational programmes aimed at preventing cyberbullying using the bystander approach, further evidence is needed in relation to all factors, although certain general directions can be discerned even at this early stage. This is a new and exciting field of research which carries the hope of eradicating bullying in all its forms. © 2018, Masaryk University.

In this study, we aimed to offer insights into bystanders’ reactions to negative news articles and other bystanders’ aggressive comments in the specific context of celebrity news. Therefore, we subjected Flemish celebrity-news articles (N = 69) and the Facebook reactions (N = 5,529) to those articles to a content analysis. First, using a quantitative content analysis, we coded each comment as having a negative, neutral, or positive tone. Next, we conducted a qualitative content analysis, which consisted of a vertical coding phase and a horizontal coding phase, so as to investigate the comments’ content in more depth and to determine which elements resulted in some comments’ negative and even aggressive tone. The results indicate that most readers’ reactions stayed on topic, thus merely contributing to the negative atmosphere that the journalist had already created. However, unlike the journalists, who tended to express their emotions rather subtly, the readers reacted using extreme aggressive language. Furthermore, although these aggressive reader reactions generally seemed to set an aggressive tone for future reactions, some readers broke this aggressive cycle and explicitly disapproved of the aggressive expressions. © 2018, Masaryk University.

To do so, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis when sufficient information was presented. The literature search was conducted based on a search strategy including the keywords “smartphone” and “personality”. Variations were not included as we seek to increase the breadth of the search. Random effects models were used to generate standardized coefficient for meta-analysis. In total, the present study included 5 papers covering 6.096 participants. Our findings indicated a scarcity of studies meeting the criteria used, but evidence regarding the relationship between problematic use of smartphone and neuroticism and impulsivity traits were found. Meta-analysis using levels of problematic use of smartphone and neuroticism and impulsivity measures showed a significant and small to moderate effect size, with an observed heterogeneity (I 2 ) equal to 97.26% (impulsivity) and 58.89% (neuroticism). More research should be carried out in the area, allowing the accumulation of evidence considering several personality pathological traits. The impulsivity and neuroticism traits should be further investigated, including studies with psychiatric samples. Future studies should seek to establish a standard for study design and assessment tools to be used. © 2018, Masaryk University.

A total of 298 young Australian adults (M ag e = 19.98 years, 75.50% female) and 300 young Indian adults (M age = 18.08 years, 56.33% female) completed a survey (online and hardcopy) assessing sending and receiving of sexts, and mental health. Australian males were more likely to have sent sexts than Indian males, whilst Australian females were more likely to have both sent and received sexts than Indian females. Indian males were more likely than Indian females to have sent and received sext messages. Higher levels of stress were associated with sending sexts for participants overall, and for Indian respondents, but not Australians when analysed separately. For males overall, higher levels of stress and lower levels of depression were associated with sending sexts, whilst for females, there were no associations with mental health variables, but higher age was associated with sending sexts. Sexting behaviours may be associated with cultural values and vary by gender in more traditional contexts. Further investigation into associations between psychological distress and the probability of sending a sext are warranted. © 2018, Masaryk University.

It is also unknown how empathy might impact the negative consequences associated with being a bystander of cyberbullying. The present study focused on examining the longitudinal association between bystander of cyberbullying, depression, and anxiety, and the moderating role of empathy in the relationship between bystander of cyberbullying and subsequent depression and anxiety. There were 1,090 adolescents (M age = 12.19; 50% female) from the United States included at Time 1, and they completed questionnaires on empathy, cyberbullying roles (bystander, perpetrator, victim), depression, and anxiety. One year later, at Time 2, 1,067 adolescents (M age = 13.76; 51% female) completed questionnaires on depression and anxiety. Results revealed a positive association between bystander of cyberbullying and depression and anxiety. Further, empathy moderated the positive relationship between bystander of cyberbullying and depression, but not for anxiety. Implications for intervention and prevention programs are discussed. © 2018, Masaryk University.

Therefore, an online questionnaire among 1,741 Dutch youngsters (10-18 years) explored, a) whether they use electronic media in a healthy manner - i.e., no media during bedtime; no smartphones while cycling; lowering headset volume; taking breaks during extended media use; and keeping un upright posture during extended use, b) whether these healthy manners vary with their gender, education level, age and use of media devices, and c) whether their healthy media use varies with their parent’s mediation. The analyses revealed that ‘only’ 11 to 30% of (pre-)adolescents use media in a healthy manner. Moreover, as expected, pre-adolescents (10-12 years), adolescents from higher education and girls were more apt to use media in a healthy manner, as were frequent users of smartphones. Finally, (pre-)adolescents who are restricted in media use by their parents and who co-use media together with parents were about two times likely to use media in a healthy manner than youngsters whose parents are not involved. These outcomes imply that healthy media use deserves more attention within the framework of media-literacy and parental mediation. © 2018, Masaryk University.

Potential predictors of class membership were also examined using multinomial logistic regression analysis. Participants were 849 German students (52.7% girls, 45.6% boys, M age = 13.4 years, SD age = 1.1 years). Observed indicators of latent class measured own involvement in cyberbullying, reactions to cyberbullying of classmates, and behavioral willingness as assistant and as defender. Indicators for the post-hoc regression analyses were proactive aggression, reactive aggression, self-esteem, cognitive, and affective empathy. Control variables were age and gender. A model with five classes was chosen. The classes were labeled prosocial defenders, communicating outsiders, aggressive defenders, bully-victims, and assistants. The results of the post-hoc regression analyses showed that students in the classes especially differed regarding types of aggression and social competencies. Based on answer patterns, cyberbullying roles beyond the bullying-triad can be found. Remarkably, three of the classes are bystanders, i.e. they are not directly involved in cyberbullying. Two of these classes showed helping behavior and made up almost two thirds of the sample. Knowledge about cyberbullying roles and their predictors is important to inform the planning and development of interventions. The results further indicate that interventions should especially take into account antisocial and passive behavioral patterns in the context of cyberbullying. © 2018, Masaryk University.

Social-cognitive and affective reactions to bullying such as empathy with the victim, moral disengagement, feelings of responsibility, defender self-efficacy and outcome expectancy are supposed to determine whether a bystander passes through all stages of the intervention model and are thereby crucial for the behavioral response. These mental reactions were compared between school bullying and cyberbullying in a sample of 486 German students (56% girls, age: M = 12.95) from 28 classes with a newly developed questionnaire covering the five Social-Cognitive and Affective Reactions to Bullying (SCARB) for school context and cyber context separately. Confirmatory factor analysis showed an acceptable fit and internal consistency coefficients were acceptable to good. In line with our hypotheses, for cyberbullying as compared to school bullying students reported higher moral disengagement and lower feelings of responsibility and self-efficacy. However, no significant difference was found for empathy. The level of negative outcome expectations was lower for cyberbullying than for school bullying. Results confirm that the context of bullying matters for the social-cognitive and affective reactions of bystanders. © 2018, Masaryk University.

In particular, perceiving and interpreting an incident as an emergency situation, realizing one’s own responsibility to intervene, and forming the intention to help are crucial preconditions for bystander interventions. The characteristics of information and communication technologies (ICTs) change and hamper these cognitive processes. Information and cues that guide individuals’ reactions to offline victimization are missing in many online environments (e.g., seeing a victim’s suffering). By applying a scenario-based experiment (n = 240; 62% female; M age = 21.3), we investigate how cyberbullying incidents with differing degrees of severity (insults only vs. insults and threats) affect bystanders’ perception of the incident, their tendency to blame the victim, and finally their reactions to cyber victimization (i.e., willingness to help). Our results showed that participants evaluated an incident that included threats and insults (as compared to insults only) as more severe; this in turn was related to a higher willingness to help the victim. In contrast, a seemingly less severe incident (containing insults only) fostered participants’ tendency to ascribe (at least partial) blame for the incident to the victim. This victim blaming correlated with a lower tendency to support the victim. In conclusion, victims of seemingly less serious incidents in particular are at risk of experiencing prolonged suffering because bystanders fail to identify the emergency character of the situation and refuse to help. © 2018, Masaryk University.

Nevertheless, a review of the results obtained by these studies has never been conducted until now. The present work aimed to fill this gap, analysing forty-three empirical studies with the specific purpose of detecting the kinds of user-avatar relationship that have been identified by literature and of exploring how these kinds of relationship are related to other psychological variables, e.g. game addiction. Results showed that literature explored the user-avatar relationship by investigating four self-dimensions (i.e., physical aspects, self-concept, self-needs, and identifications). Two kinds of user-avatar relationships recurred more frequently: actualisation and idealisation, of which, considering the correlations with other variables, idealization appears to be riskier. The theoretical contribution and practical applications of this work are discussed. © 2018, Masaryk University.

Such self-relevant Internet searches are most probably accompanied by affective states such as threat (e.g., being afraid of a serious illness). Thus, threat can influence the entire Internet search process. Threat is known to elicit a preference for positive information. This positive bias has recently been shown for separate steps of the Internet search process (i.e., selection of links, scanning of webpages, and recall of information). To extend this research, the present study aimed at investigating the influence of threat across the Internet search process. We expected that threatened individuals similarly prefer positive information during this process. An experimental laboratory study was conducted with undergraduate students (N = 114) enrolled in a broad range of majors. In this study, threat was manipulated and then participants were to complete a preprogrammed, realistic Internet search task which was used to assess selection of links, scanning of webpages, and recall of information. The results supported our hypothesis and revealed that, during the Internet search task, threatened individuals directed more attention to positive information (i.e., selected more positive links and scanned positive webpages longer) and, as a consequence, also recalled more positive information than non-threatened individuals. Thus, our study shows that not only separate steps but also the Internet search process as such is susceptible to being influenced by affective states such as threat. © 2018 Cyberpsychology: Journal of Psychosocial Research on Cyberspace.","Counter-regulation; Health-related information; Internet search; Self-relevance; Threat",,,,,,,,,,"Andrewes, D., (2001) Neuropsychology: From Theory to Practice, , New York, NY: Psychology Press; Becker, D., Grapendorf, J., Greving, H., Sassenberg, K., Perceived threat and Internet use predict intentions to get bowel cancer screening (Colonoscopy): A longitudinal questionnaire study (2018) Journal of Medical Internet Research, 20. , https://doi.org/10.2196/jmir.9144; Blascovich, J., Tomaka, J., The biopsychosocial model of arousal regulation (1996) Advances in Experimental Social Psychology, 28, pp. 1-51. , https://doi.org/10.1016/S0065-2601(08)60235-X; Brand-Gruwel, S., Wopereis, I., Vermetten, Y., Information problem solving by experts and novices: Analysis of a complex cognitive skill (2005) Computers in Human Behavior, 21, pp. 487-508. , https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chb.2004.10.005; Brand-Gruwel, S., Wopereis, I., Walraven, A., A descriptive model of information problem solving while using internet (2009) Computers & Education, 53, pp. 1207-1217. , https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compedu.2009.06.004; Cohen, J., Cohen, P., West, S.G., Aiken, L.S., (2003) Applied Multiple Regression/Correlation Analysis for the Behavioral Sciences, , (3rd ed.).

This study investigates whether and how privacy control features embedded in Facebook’s user interface could serve as a cue to influence adolescents in their critical processing and perceived persuasiveness of targeted advertisements. To test this, an experimental study among 178 adolescents aged 14-16 years was conducted. Results reveal that increasing privacy control salience by means of user interface elements leads to more critical processing of targeted advertising; at the same time, when adolescents perceive a higher privacy control, they also evaluate a targeted ad as more effective, convincing and reliable (i.e., increase in perceived persuasiveness). The study further identifies two underlying mechanisms by which these effects operate: perceived control and self-efficacy. Based on these findings, theoretical contributions and practical implications are discussed to optimize advertising campaigns on social networking sites in a responsible and privacy-protective way. © 2018 Cyberpsychology: Journal of Psychosocial Research on Cyberspace.","Advertising; Critical processing; Facebook; Persuasion; Privacy control",,,,,,"Agentschap Innoveren en Ondernemen, VLAIO

Skilful digital engagement may, however, constitute a valuable asset in necessary identity exploration and commitment. Applying a person-oriented approach, we examined for the first time how identity profiles are associated with digital engagement, operationalized as digital competence, gaming seriousness, type of internet activity and excessive ICT use. After controlling for gender, life satisfaction and parental SES, this study of a Finnish high school sample (N = 932) revealed that adolescents with future commitments and some exploration of options (achievement, searching moratorium) were the most advanced in digital skills and, in the former case, least prone to excessive ICT use. By contrast, adolescents desperately trying to solve the identity task (ruminative moratorium) scored highest on friendship-driven internet activity and excessive ICT use, whereas diffused individuals had the weakest digital competence. No differences between the profiles emerged regarding gaming and interest-driven internet activity. The results suggest that the digital world and related devices are purposeful tools for shaping and maintaining healthy identity commitments. © 2018 Cyberpsychology: Journal of Psychosocial Research on Cyberspace.","Digital engagement; Identity formation; Identity status; Person-oriented approach",,,,,,"Academy of Finland: 308351, 273872, 298323","This research was supported by the Academy of Finland research grants 298323, 308351 and 273872 to Katariina Salmela-Aro.",,,"Anderson, C.A., Violent, nonviolent, and prosocial gaming effects on teens’ civic engagement (2014) Oxford Handbooks Online, , New York: Oxford University Press; Arnett, J.J., (2004) Emerging Adulthood: The Winding Road from The Late Teens through The Twenties, , New York, NY: Oxford University Press; Bacchini, D., de Angelis, G., Fanara, A., Identity formation in adolescent and emerging adult regular players of massively multiplayer online role-playing games (MMORPG) (2017) Computers in Human Behavior, 73, pp. 191-199. , https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chb.2017.03.045; Bergman, L.R., Magnusson, D., El-Khouri, B., (2003) Studying Individual Development in an Interindividual Context: A Person-Oriented Approach, , Mahwah, NJ: Erlbaum; (2016) Helsingin Kaupungin Opetuksen Digitalisaatio-Ohjelma Vuosille 2016-2019 [The Helsinki City Digitalisation Program of Education for Years 2016-2019], , https://www.hel.fi/static/liitteet/opev/Opetusvirasto_Digitalisaatiohanke_Webjulkaisu_FINAL.pdf; Clark, L.A., Watson, D., Constructing validity (1995) Psychological Assessment, 7, pp. 309-319. , https://doi.org/10.1037/1040-3590.7.3.309; Cohen, J., (1988) Statistical Power Analysis for the Behavioral Sciences, , Hillsdale, NJ: Erlbaum; Côté, J.E., Emerging adulthood as an institutionalized moratorium: Risks and benefits to identity formation (2006) Emerging Adults in America: Coming of Age in the 21St Century, pp. 85-116. , J.

Ninety-three U.S. non-clinical participants (51 men and 42 women) were recruited, who were 18 years and older and had no history of chronic health problems or mental illnesses. Each experiment consisted of the three data collection phases, including the pre-experiment survey, an experience session of a virtual self-avatar, and the post-experiment survey. For the development of the virtual avatar protocol, this study employed 3D body scanning to create a participant’s virtual body model based on accurate anthropometric data, to simulate a virtual avatar closely matched with the participant’s actual physique. Overall, the data indicated an increase in perceived body image discrepancy and a decrease in body satisfaction after participating in a virtual avatar session, and those who showed higher body dissatisfaction exhibited a stronger intention regulated for weight control. Specifically in gender, the statistical results were generally intensified in the female group, but the male group showed a stronger intention to be involved in exercising after virtual avatar experience. The insights gained from this study suggested future directions for research and program development, and urged that practical applications of the virtual avatar approach must be implemented with caution when it uses clinical samples, because its risk-benefit assessment has not been sufficiently investigated yet. © 2018 Cyberpsychology: Journal of Psychosocial Research on Cyberspace.","3D body scanning; Body image; Virtual avatar; Weight regulation intention",,,,,,"U.S. Department of Agriculture, USDA: COL00224","This work was supported in party by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) through the Colorado Agricultural Experiment Station Hatch Funds under Grant [COL00224].",,,"Adams, G., Turner, H., Bucks, R., The experience of body dissatisfaction in men (2005) Body Image, 2, pp. 271-283. , https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bodyim.2005.05.004; Anschutz, D.J., Engels, R.C., Becker, E.S., The bold and the beautiful.

More specifically, the study investigated the mediating role of gaming motives between self-concept clarity and problematic online gaming. Data from 509 young adult (M = 23.14, SD = 4.66) video game players from Croatia were analyzed. Problematic online gaming was positively correlated with social, competition, coping, fantasy and escape motives for playing online video games, and negatively with self-concept clarity. Hierarchical regression analyses revealed that escape motives and self-concept clarity were significant predictors of problematic online gaming after controlling for age and weekly gaming time. The results of the mediation model showed that self-concept clarity was both directly and indirectly (via escape motive) associated with problematic online gaming. The discussion addresses the issue of escapism in relation to self-concept clarity and as a factor in predicting problematic online gaming. © 2018 Cyberpsychology: Journal of Psychosocial Research on Cyberspace.","Croatia; Internet gaming disorder; Motives for playing online video games; Problematic online gaming; Self-concept clarity",,,,,,,,,,"Aarseth, E., Bean, A.M., Boonen, H., Colder Carras, M., Coulson, M., Das, D., Haagsma, M.C., Scholars’ open debate paper on the World Health Organization ICD-11 Gaming Disorder proposal (2017) Journal of Behavioral Addictions, 6, pp. 267-270. , https://doi.org/10.1556/2006.5.2016.088; (2013) Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, , 5th ed.).

This article reports results from two experiments (with participants from the U.S.) that investigate the impacts of breadth and depth of information disclosed in a profile on viewers’ attributional confidence about and interpersonal attraction to the profile owner. In the first experiment (n = 320), participants viewed a profile containing either low or high breadth of information. Analyses indicated that, higher breadth of information shared in the profile increased interpersonal attraction and that attributional confidence mediated this relationship. The second experiment (n = 537) tested the respective influences of breadth (low vs. high) and depth of disclosure (low vs. high) in a profile on perceivers’ attributional confidence and interpersonal attraction. Analyses indicated that, while increasing the breadth of information had a positive impact on interpersonal attraction to profile owners, increasing the depth of information reduced attraction. Additionally, there was a significant interaction between breadth and depth of information in predicting attributional confidence; increasing the depth of information shared in an SNS profile enhanced attributional confidence only when the breadth of information shared was low. © 2018 Cyberpsychology: Journal of Psychosocial Research on Cyberspace.","Attributional confidence; Impression formation; Personal information; Self-disclosure breadth; Self-disclosure depth; Social network site profiles",,,,,,,,,,"Afifi, W.A., Burgoon, J.K., The impact of violations on uncertainty and the consequences for attractiveness (2000) Human Communication Research, 26, pp. 203-233. , https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1468-2958.2000.tb00756.x; Ajzen, I., Effects of information on interpersonal attraction: Similarity versus affective value (1974) Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 29, pp. 374-380. , https://doi.org/10.1037/h0036002; Altman, I., Taylor, D., (1973) Social Penetration: The Development of Interpersonal Relationships, , New York: Holt, Rinehart and Winston; Ambady, N., Rosenthal, R., Half a minute: Predicting teacher evaluations from thin slices of nonverbal behavior and physical attractiveness (1993) Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 64, pp. 431-441. , https://doi.org/10.1037/0022-3514.64.3.431; Anderson, S.P., de Palma, A., Information congestion (2009) RAND Journal of Economics, (4), pp. 688-709. , https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1756-2171.2009.00085.x; Anderson, S.P., de Palma, A., Competition for attention in the Information (Overload) Age (2012) RAND Journal of Economics, 43, pp. 1-25. , https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1756-2171.2011.00155.x; Antheunis, M.L., Valkenburg, P.M., Peter, J., Getting acquainted through social network sites: Testing a model of online uncertainty reduction and social attraction (2010) Computers in Human Behavior, 26, pp. 100-109. , https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chb.2009.07.005; Archer, R.L., Berg, J.H., Disclosure reciprocity and its limits: A reactance analysis (1978) Journal of Experimental Social Psychology, 14, pp. 527-540. , https://doi.org/10.1016/0022-1031(78)90047-1; Attrill, A., Jalil, R., Revealing only the superficial me: Exploring categorical self-disclosure online (2011) Computers in Human Behavior, 27, pp. 1634-1642. , https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chb.2011.02.001; Baruh, L., Cemalcılar, Z., Rubbernecking effect of intimate information on Twitter: When getting attention works against interpersonal attraction (2015) Cyberpsychology, Behavior, and Social Networking, 18, pp. 506-513. , https://doi.org/10.1089/cyber.2015.0099; Baruh, L., Cemalcılar, Z., Bisson, C., Chisik, Y., First impressions on social network sites: Impact of self-disclosure breadth on Attraction (2017) Proceedings of the 4Th European Conference on Social Media, pp. 54-62. , A.

We build on the assumption that online civic participation differs from more traditional offline civic participation in several key characteristics, namely lacking proximity to other actors, possible disconnection between civic actions and their outcomes, and a reduced hierarchy within the online environment. Considering these specifics, the study examined the longitudinal effect of online participation on the development of civic identity, political self-efficacy, and attitudes toward social authorities. Concurrently, we contrasted the impact of online participation with the impact of offline civic participation. Data from a survey-based two-wave panel study conducted in Spring 2014 and Autumn 2015 in the Czech Republic were utilized. The sample comprised 768 adolescents (aged 14-17 in T1; 54% females). The results showed that online participation predicted increased challenging attitudes towards social authorities, while offline participation had the opposite effect. Furthermore, online participation had no effect on political self-efficacy or civic development, but offline participation positively predicted civic identity. The findings are discussed with regard to the specific benefits and limits of online civic participation. © 2007-2017 Cyberpsychology: Journal of Psychosocial Research on Cyberspace.","Adolescence; Civic development; Online participation",,,,,,"GrantovÃ¡ Agentura ÄeskÃ© Republiky, GA ÄR: GA14-20582S

Using a two (communication mode: online vs. face-to-face) by two (feedback valence: confirming vs. disconfirming) between-subjects experiment, we found that feedback had a significant indirect effect on self-esteem, through the receiver’s reciprocal feedback. This indirect effect of feedback differed in online communication from offline: In online communication, participants reciprocated negative feedback when they received it, more than in face-to-face communication. The reciprocal feedback enhanced their self-esteem in online communication, but not in face-to-face communication. Although people tend to respond more negatively to negative comments in online conversations, the process, overall, boosts rather than hinders their self-esteem. © 2007-2017 Cyberpsychology: Journal of Psychosocial Research on Cyberspace.","Feedback; Online communication; Online self-disclosure; Reciprocal feedback; Self-esteem",,,,,,,,,,"Altman, I., Taylor, D.A., (1973) Social Penetration: The Development of Interpersonal Relationships, , New York, NY: Holt, Rinehart & Winston; Amin, N., Foa, E.B., Coles, M.E., Negative interpretation bias in social phobia (1998) Behaviour Research and Therapy, 36, pp. 945-957. , https://doi.org/10.1016/S0005-7967(98)00060-6; Antheunis, M.L., Valkenburg, P.M., Peter, J., Computer-mediated communication and interpersonal attraction: An experimental test of two explanatory hypotheses (2007) Cyberpsychology and Behavior, 10, pp. 831-836. , https://doi.org/10.1089/cpb.2007.9945; Archer, R.L., Berg, J.H., Runge, T.E., Active and passive observers’ attraction to a self-disclosing other (1980) Journal of Experimental Social Psychology, 16, pp. 130-145. , https://doi.org/10.1016/0022-1031(80)90004-9; Aron, A., Melinat, E., Aron, E.N., Vallone, R.D., Bator, R.J., The experimental generation of interpersonal closeness: A procedure and some preliminary findings (1997) Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, 23, pp. 363-377. , https://doi.org/10.1177/0146167297234003; Bargh, J.A., McKenna, K.Y.A., Fitzsimons, G.M., Can you see the real me?

Past research shows that work role stressors (i.e., role conflict, role ambiguity, and role overload) and Big Five personality traits (i.e., neuroticism, conscientiousness, extraversion, and agreeableness) predict cyberloafing, but research has yet to explore interactions among these factors. The current study aimed to address this gap by examining whether work role stressors strengthen the relationship between personality and cyberloafing based on the Personal Resource Allocation (PRA) framework. In an online survey of employees from diverse occupations (N = 343), we replicated past work showing relationships among personality traits and cyberloafing. However, role conflict was the only stressor that predicted cyberloafing. Moderated multiple regression analyses suggested only three statistically robust findings in the expected direction: role conflict strengthening the positive association between neuroticism and cyberloafing, role conflict strengthening the negative association between agreeableness and cyberloafing, and role overload strengthening the negative association between conscientiousness and cyberloafing. Overall, this study implies mixed and somewhat weak support for PRA framework predictions, including a lack of consistency in a specific role stressor enhancing personality-cyberloafing relationships. Practical implications for personnel selection and employee training/development are also discussed. © 2007-2017 Cyberpsychology: Journal of Psychosocial Research on Cyberspace.","Counterproductive work behavior; Cyberloafing; Personality traits; Work role stressors",,,,,,,,,,"Andreassen, C., Torsheim, T., Pallesen, S., Predictors of use of social network sites at work - a specific type of cyberloafing (2014) Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication, 19, pp. 906-921. , https://doi.org/10.1111/jcc4.12085; Arnold, T., Flaherty, K., Voss, K., Mowen, J., Role stressors and retail performance: The role of perceived competitive climate (2009) Journal of Retailing, 85, pp. 194-205. , https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jretai.2009.02.002; Ashton, M., Personality and job performance: The importance of narrow traits (1998) Journal of Organizational Behavior, 19, pp. 289-303. , https://doi.org/10.1002/(SICI)1099-1379(199805)19:3<289::AID-JOB841>3.0.CO;2-C; Barrick, M., Stewart, G., Piotrowski, M., Personality and job performance: Test of the mediating effects of motivation among sales representatives (2002) Journal of Applied Psychology, 87, pp. 43-51. , https://doi.org/10.1037/0021-9010.87.1.43; Bowling, N., Eschleman, K., Employee personality as a moderator of the relationships between work stressors and counterproductive work behavior (2010) Journal of Occupational Health Psychology, 15, pp. 91-103. , https://doi.org/10.1037/a0017326; Conlin, M., Workers, surf at your own risk (2000) Businessweek.Com, , http://www.businessweek.com/2000/00_24/b3685257.htm; Connor-Smith, J., Flachsbart, C., Relations between personality and coping: A meta-analysis (2007) Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 93, pp. 1080-1107. , https://doi.org/10.1037/0022-3514.93.6.1080; Donnellan, M., Lucas, R., Age differences in the Big Five across the life span: Evidence from two national samples (2008) Psychology and Aging, 23, pp. 558-566. , https://doi.org/10.1037/a0012897; Donnellan, M., Oswald, F., Baird, B., Lucas, R., The mini-IPIP scales: Tiny-yet-effective measures of the Big Five factors of personality (2006) Psychological Assessment, 18, pp. 192-203. , https://doi.org/10.1037/1040-3590.18.2.192; Folkman, S., Lazarus, R., Coping as a mediator of emotion (1988) Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 54, p. 466. , https://doi.org/10.1037/0022-3514.54.3.466; Fox, S., Spector, P., Goh, A., Bruursema, K., Does your coworker know what you're doing?

Combined, these qualities may predispose them to experience unique stressors when using social network sites (SNSs). Focus groups of adolescent Facebook users who have a primary anxiety diagnosis uncovered narratives describing individuals’ perspectives related to how Facebook can influence their anxiety. Qualitative analysis revealed six themes related to Facebook stressors: seeking approval, fearing judgment, escalating interpersonal issues, wanting privacy, negotiating self and social identity, and connecting & disconnecting. Many participants reported a fear of receiving negative comments online and discussed strategies to avoid them, such as posting less content (i.e., comments, photographs) than their peers. Some participants described feeling positive emotions when they received a “like” from a SNS user, however, they also tended to describe these positive emotions as “false”, “unreal” and “fleeting.” Notably, many participants reported comparing themselves to peers on Facebook, which increased feelings of anxiety, as well as compulsive checking behaviours, such as monitoring posted content and friend lists. These findings were coupled with discussions surrounding rumination, privacy, and elevated personal conflict due in part to the public nature of Facebook. The narratives from our exploratory study suggest there are various mechanisms through which Facebook may exacerbate anxiety in adolescents who have pre-existing anxiety disorders and thereby may make them vulnerable to negative online experiences. Understanding the underlying themes of this phenomenon can aid clinicians, school staff, and parents in identifying potential stressors for anxious adolescents who use SNSs, and provide strategies around social media use for this specific patient population. Future quantitative studies are recommended to further understand the relationships between Facebook stressors and expressed anxiety in clinical populations. © 2007-2017 Cyberpsychology: Journal of Psychosocial Research on Cyberspace.","Adolescence; Anxiety disorders; Facebook; Social media; Social networking sites",,,,,,,,,,"Anderson, J.C., Williams, S., McGee, R., Silva, P.A., DSM-III disorders in preadolescent children: Prevalence in a large sample from the general population (1987) Archives of General Psychiatry, 44, pp. 69-76. , https://doi.org/10.1001/archpsyc.1987.01800130081010; Antony, M.M., Recent advances in the treatment of anxiety disorders (2011) Canadian Psychology/Psychologie Canadienne, 52, pp. 1-9. , https://doi.org/10.1037/a0022237; Antony, M., McCabe, R., Perfectionism (2005) Encyclopedia of Cognitive Behavior Therapy, pp. 273-277. , A.

The present study was designed to better understand how young people utilise multiple types of information and communication technology (ICT) in their everyday lives and how these preferences may be associated with key aspects of their development. To this end, the present study was designed to explore whether specific profiles of technology usage would be associated with key characteristics of identity and behaviour. To identify groups of adolescents who share similar technology use habits, a sample of 933 adolescents reported on their time spent interacting with various digital communication devices and associated platforms. Utilizing a latent profile analysis, four distinct profiles of technology use preferences emerged. Then, a series of linear regressions were calculated to investigate the degree to which class membership predicted indicators of identity and problem behaviours. The findings suggest that important concepts of both identity and behaviour are associated with individual ICT usage preferences.

While adolescents grow up with social media, parents have more difficulties with them, leading to uncertainties regarding their adolescents’ social media mediation. This study contributes to parental mediation research by (1) investigating whether mediation strategies defined by previous research are also relevant for social media use, and (2) exploring whether parents’ social media literacy is connected to the choice for a certain mediation strategy, as previous research already identified other impact factors such as children’s age or family composition. Using a qualitative research design, we interviewed 14 parents and 13 adolescents from 10 families in Belgium. Results indicate that, consistent with previous research, parents in this study mostly use active mediation focusing on risks and safety on social media. However, some parents monitor their children through social media accounts specifically set up for monitoring, or specialized mobile apps. Furthermore, parents with high (mostly critical) social media literacy choose active mediation over restrictive or technical strategies, recognizing opportunities of social media and letting adolescents explore on their own. © 2017, Masaryk University.

The analyses reveal that parents vary widely in their media consumption (from about 1 to more than 6½ hours media per day). Since the children’s media use parallels their parent’s, parents seem to provide an important example in the home. Data also show that lower and higher use families differ significantly on income, education level, number of devices at home, views on media for children, ease of applying co-active mediation and children’s proficiency in media use. Finally, the four family types can best be distinguished on the basis of quantity characteristics (education level, number of screens at home, time spent by children on media) and quality characteristics (type of media content used, ease of mediation, views on media for children). Consequences for young children’s development and parenting support are described. © 2017, Masaryk University.

We were particularly interested in understanding the range of research designs and specifics about elements of the method employed for researching digital technologies with young children (i.e., birth to 5 years). We focused precisely on this age group because it overlaps with the early childhood education period, and recent policy statements that focus on technology usage in young children and offer varying recommendations for children whose chronological age falls in the first five years of life. We completed a detailed analysis of 60 studies published 2011 to 2015; our synthesis focused on describing the research designs, and several specifics of the research method in each primary source: child demographics, the materials used in the research tasks, and the social and cognitive nature of tasks that children engaged in throughout each empirical study. Our findings provide insight for a framework that captures the complex interplay between child development, learning, lived experiences, and social contexts that surround the use of digital technologies. © 2017, Masaryk University.

YouTube’s simple user interface, that allows even toddlers to proceed to the next item on the playlist and affords them easy access to their favorite videos, has been suggested as the key to its popularity with very young audiences. On the other hand, young children’s lack of technical, critical and social skills renders them particularly vulnerable to commercial and age-inappropriate content that they might encounter online. In this rapidly changing media environment, in which more and more children begin online activity at a much younger age, it is crucial to evaluate the amount of young children’s online viewing and the factors that determine their viewing habits. Consequently, the present study aimed at identifying the profile of toddler online viewers based on child, parent and family-related characteristics and revealing predictors that might explain higher online exposure. The study, based on a face-to-face survey conducted in Israel among 289 parents of toddlers aged 18-36 months, reveals that online viewing has become normative behavior among toddlers and emphasizes how deeply online viewing is integrated into the basic daily routine of parents with very young children who use online viewing platforms to fulfill a wide range of their childrearing needs. © 2017, Masaryk University.

Current studies have mostly been quantitative. They have mainly focused on children aged 9 and older, and have addressed the types of mediation that parents use. However, they have not considered their relation to specific risks and opportunities. In the present study, we have sought to address this discrepancy and to understand the mediation strategies that parents use to shape the online experiences of their children. We focused on the factors that play a role in these mediations of specific risks and opportunities. In-depth semi-structured interviews with the parents of children aged 7–8 and their siblings in the Czech Republic (N=10 families) were conducted in 2014. A thematic analysis identified three main themes: (1) Mediation strategies of technology usage in relation to the mediation of online opportunities and online risks; (2) Time and place management of mediation strategies; and (3) The child as a co-creator of mediation strategies. Our results indicated that parental mediation is a dynamic process that is co-constructed by the parents and children according to context. © 2017, Masaryk University.

A reason for this is that parents are not always aware of what they do and why, as their choices do not necessarily involve rational decision-making. In the present study we adopted the notion of “tacit knowledge” (Nonaka & Takeuchi, 1995; Polanyi, 1966) to explore how and why parents of young children mediate digital media use. In-depth interviews were conducted with 24 Dutch parents from 15 families who were selected to represent a range of socioeconomic backgrounds and different family compositions. Through qualitative analysis we first distinguished three mediation styles of “regulation”, “guidance” and “space”. Furthermore, we revealed seven values that drive parental mediation: three core values of “balance”, “freedom” and “protection” that are foundational in the sense that they explain why parents mediate; three orientational values of “qualification”, “Bildung” and “health/fitness” that explain to which end parents mediate; and one additional value of “flexibility” that accounts for parents’ exception-making. Finally, we showed that the most important emotions associated with these values were anger and disapproval (with balance and protection) and love and joy (with orientational values); fear was mentioned occasionally (in relation to protection). © 2017, Masaryk University.

This exploratory study investigated sexting behaviours among undergraduate students in Botswana (N = 309, 64.5% female; mean age = 20.3 years). Most participants (84.8%) had received sexts and many (61.8%) had sent sexts at least once in their lifetime. Reasons for sending sexts were to flirt (42.9%), to have fun (24.6%), and/or to initiate sexual activity (17.8%). Only 36.7% of the participants were worried about their sexts being forwarded to others, and 30.2% had forwarded sexts to others. Being sexually active (OR = 4.52), drinking alcohol (OR = 2.52), and having a mother with tertiary level education (OR = 0.40) emerged as significant predictors of sending sexts. Among participants who had sexual intercourse at least once in their lifetime (N = 164), an increase in the frequency of sexting was associated with an increase in the number of sexual partners and with sex under the influence of alcohol and drugs. However, sexting behaviours were not associated with unprotected sex. The results are compared with findings from Western countries and discussed with regard to public health care and safe sex education in Botswana. © 2007-2017 Cyberpsychology: Journal of Psychosocial Research on Cyberspace.","Botswana; Risky sexual behaviours; Sexting; Undergraduate students; Young adults",,,,,,,,,,"Arnett, J.J., Emerging adulthood.

Participants were 155 undergraduate students (105 females; 50 males) ranging from 17 to 25 years old (M = 19.38, SD = 1.65) with dating experience and a minimum relationship duration of 3 months. Self-report assessments of cyber dating abuse, self-esteem, and emotional distress from the relationship were completed. Mediation analysis using multiple regressions revealed a full mediation model. Cyber dating abuse predicted lowered self-esteem and greater emotional distress. However, when emotional distress was entered as a predictor of self-esteem, cyber dating abuse became non-significant, indicating full mediation. Early-onset of dating was also a risk factor for cyber dating abuse and emotional distress. Few gender differences were evident. These findings add to the growing body of evidence on the negative effects of cyber dating abuse and suggest that distressing emotional reactions may underlie the deleterious consequences of this form of abuse. © 2007-2017 Cyberpsychology: Journal of Psychosocial Research on Cyberspace.","Adolescent dating relationships; Cyber dating violence; Emerging adulthood; Emotional distress; Self-esteem",,,,,,,,,,"Aiken, L.S., West, S.G., (1991) Multiple Regression: Testing and Interpreting Interactions, , Newbury Park: Sage; Alexy, E., Burgess, A., Baker, T., Smoyak, S., Perceptions of cyberstalking among college students (2005) Brief Treatment and Crisis Intervention, 5, pp. 279-289; Arnett, J.J., Emerging adulthood: A theory of development from the late teens through the twenties (2000) American Psychologist, 55, pp. 469-480; Baron, R.M., Kenny, D.A., The moderator-mediator variable distinction in social psychological research: Conceptual, strategic and statistical considerations (1986) Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 51, pp. 1173-1182. , https://doi.org/10.1037/0022-3514.51.6.1173; Borrajo, E., Gamez-Guadix, M., Calvete, E., Cyber dating abuse: Prevalence, context, and relationship with offline dating aggression (2015) Psychological Reports: Relationships & Communications, 116, pp. 565-585. , https://doi.org/10.2466/21.16.PR0.116k22w4; Burke, S.C., Wallen, M., Vail-Smith, K., Knox, D., Using technology to control intimate partners: An exploratory study of college undergraduates (2011) Computers in Human Behavior, 27, pp. 1162-1167. , https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chb.2010.12.010; Burton, C.W., Halpern-Felsher, B., Rehm, R.S., Rankin, S., Humphreys, J., C.

Time lost due to cyberloafing can have substantial impact on productivity. This research was the first to investigate the mechanisms by which dark personality traits and perceived ability to deceive are associated with cyberloafing. A sample of currently or previously employed participants (N = 273), completed measures of psychopathy, Machiavellianism, narcissism, perceived ability to deceive, and cyberloafing. Path analysis was used to evaluate the model, and revealed good fit. As predicted, PATD mediated the relationships between the Dark Triad and cyberloafing, while psychopathy also related to cyberloafing directly. These findings suggest that in order to reduce cyberloafing, workplace policy should target an individual’s confidence in their ability to evade detection when misusing the Internet. Future research could strengthen the approach taken here by including a behavioural measure of cyberloafing. It is concluded that perceived ability to deceive plays a vital role in determining the way in which individuals possessing dark personality characteristics engage in technology-based counterproductive work behaviours. © 2007-2017 Cyberpsychology: Journal of Psychosocial Research on Cyberspace.","Counterproductive workplace behaviours; Cyberloafing; Perceived ability to deceive; Personal use of the Internet; Personality traits",,,,,,,,,,"Andreassen, C.S., Torsheim, T., Pallesen, S., Predictors of use of social network sites at work: A specific type of cyberloafing (2014) Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication, 19, pp. 906-921. , https://doi.org/10.1111/jcc4.12085; Arbuckle, J.L., (2014) Amos 23.0 User’s Guide, , Chicago: IBM SPSS; Askew, K., Buckner, J.E., Taing, M.U., Ilie, A., Bauer, J.A., Coovert, M.D., Explaining cyberloafing: The role of the theory of planned behavior (2014) Computers in Human Behavior, 36, pp. 510-519. , https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chb.2014.04.006; Babiak, P., Neumann, C.S., Hare, R.D., Corporate psychopathy: Talking the walk (2010) Behavioural Sciences and the Law, 28, pp. 174-193. , https://doi.org/10.1002/bsl.925; Beugre, C.D., Kim, D., Cyberloafing: Vice or virtue?

We sampled 309 community participants online to understand the role of content consumption vs. social smartphone use in relation to specific problematic smartphone behaviors. Bivariate correlations indicated mostly significant relationships between problematic smartphone behaviors and both process and social usage – but with stronger correlations for process usage. Regression analyses, controlling for age and gender, demonstrated that problematic smartphone-related overuse was significantly associated with process smartphone usage, and to a lesser extent - social usage. Positive anticipation problem behaviors were related to process and social usage. Daily life disturbances from a smartphone were inversely related to process and social usage. Results provide insight into the types of problem smartphone behaviors associated with specific uses and gratifications from a smartphone. © 2007-2017 Cyberpsychology: Journal of Psychosocial Research on Cyberspace.","Gratification; Information technology; Internet addiction; Mobile phones; Social networks",,,,,,,,,,"Blumler, J.G., The role of theory in uses and gratifications studies (1979) Communication Research, 6, pp. 9-36. , https://doi.org/10.1177/009365027900600102; Blumler, J.G., Katz, E., (1974) The Uses of Mass Communications: Current Perspectives on Gratifications Research, , Beverly Hills, California: Sage; Cazzulino, F., Burke, R.V., Muller, V., Arbogast, H., Upperman, J.S., Cell phones and young drivers: A systematic review regarding the association between psychological factors and prevention (2014) Traffic Injury Prevention, 15, pp. 234-242. , https://doi.org/10.1080/15389588.2013.822075; Chou, C., Hsiao, M.-C., Internet addiction, usage, gratification, and pleasure experience: The Taiwan college students’ case (2000) Computers & Education, 35, pp. 65-80. , https://doi.org/10.1016/S0360-1315(00)00019-1; Demirci, K., Akgonul, M., Akpinar, A., Relationship of smartphone use severity with sleep quality, depression, and anxiety in university students (2015) Journal of Behavioral Addictions, 4, pp. 85-92. , https://doi.org/10.1556/2006.4.2015.010; Dhir, A., Chen, S., Nieminen, M., Predicting adolescent Internet addiction: The roles of demographics, technology accessibility, unwillingness to communicate and sought Internet gratifications (2015) Computers in Human Behavior, 51, pp. 24-33. , https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chb.2015.04.056; Elhai, J.D., Dvorak, R.D., Levine, J.C., Hall, B.J., Problematic smartphone use: A conceptual overview and systematic review of relations with anxiety and depression psychopathology (2017) Journal of Affective Disorders, 207, pp. 251-259. , https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2016.08.030; Elhai, J.D., Levine, J.C., Dvorak, R.D., Hall, B.J., Fear of missing out, need for touch, anxiety and depression are related to problematic smartphone use (2016) Computers in Human Behavior, 63, pp. 509-516. , https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chb.2016.05.079; Elhai, J.D., Levine, J.C., Dvorak, R.D., Hall, B.J., Non-social features of smartphone use are most related to depression, anxiety and problematic smartphone use (2017) Computers in Human Behavior, 69, pp. 75-82. , https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chb.2016.12.023; Eyvazlou, M., Zarei, E., Rahimi, A., Abazari, M., Association between overuse of mobile phones on quality of sleep and general health among occupational health and safety students (2016) Chronobiology International, 33, pp. 293-300. , https://doi.org/10.3109/07420528.2015.1135933; Godwin-Jones, R., Mobile apps for language learning (2011) Language Learning and Technology, 15 (2), pp. 2-11; Gunuc, S., Relationships and associations between video game and Internet addictions: Is tolerance a symptom seen in all conditions (2015) Computers in Human Behavior, 49, pp. 517-525. , https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chb.2015.03.063; Jeong, S.-H., Kim, H., Yum, J.-Y., Hwang, Y., What type of content are smartphone users addicted to?: SNS vs. games (2016) Computers in Human Behavior, 54, pp. 10-17. , https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chb.2015.07.035; Kalkbrenner, J., McCampbell, A., The advent of smartphones: A study on the effect of handheld electronics on personal and professional productivity (2011) Journal of Applied Global Research, 4, pp. 1-9; Kardefelt-Winther, D., A conceptual and methodological critique of internet addiction research: Towards a model of compensatory internet use (2014) Computers in Human Behavior, 31, pp. 351-354. , https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chb.2013.10.059; Kawachi, I., Berkman, L.F., Social ties and mental health (2001) Journal of Urban Health, 78, pp. 458-467. , https://doi.org/10.1093/jurban/78.3.458; Kim, J., Haridakis, P.M., The role of internet user characteristics and motives in explaining three dimensions of internet addiction (2009) Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication, 14, pp. 988-1015. , https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1083-6101.2009.01478.x; Kim, J., Seo, M., David, P., Alleviating depression only to become problematic mobile phone users: Can face-to-face communication be the antidote?

This study explores exposure to such user-created alcohol promotion and the association with higher-risk drinking in a sample of young adults in the United Kingdom. An online cross-sectional survey with 18-25 year olds (N = 405) was used to measure awareness of, and participation with, 11 forms of user-created alcohol promotion. Higher-risk drinking was measured through the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test – Consumption (AUDIT-C). On average, participants were aware of 7.48 user-created alcohol promotion channels and had participated with 4.36. A hierarchical logistic regression highlighted a positive association between exposure to user-created alcohol promotion and higher-risk consumption, with participation (AOR = 1.64) having a stronger association with higher-risk consumption than awareness (AOR = 1.19). The results suggest that young adults are aware of, and participating with, a cumulative range of user-created alcohol promotion, both within and beyond social media. Further research is required to understand whether this association with higher-risk drinking is causal, the links between user-created alcohol promotion and commercial marketing, and the wider utility of user-created content to influence health behaviours in young adults. © 2007-2017 Cyberpsychology: Journal of Psychosocial Research on Cyberspace.","Alcohol; Consumption; Higher-risk drinking; Users-created promotion; Young adults",,,,,,,"This research was funded by The Salvation Army (TSA).

However, several studies indicate that parents are one of the most important facilitators in the every-day life of young persons with intellectual disabilities. Therefore, the aim of the current article is to highlight parents’ perceptions and actions in relation to opportunities and barriers for these young people when using the Internet. The empirical material consists of interviews with 22 parents of intellectually challenged young people in Sweden. The transcribed interviews were analysed using a thematic analysis, which is a method of identifying, analysing and reporting patterns within data sets. The results show that parents’ views are double-edged; on the one hand, they see great possibilities for their children, thanks to the Internet, but on the other hand, they are afraid that due to their disability, their children are more sensitive to different contents and interactions on the Internet. Furthermore, the results indicate that parents believe that the Internet can facilitate participation in social life, but that it precludes young people with intellectual disabilities from being part of society in general when it comes to community functions and services. This article will discuss barriers and support in relation to the individual and her or his support system, which brings into focus the parent’s responsibility and support for young people, helping them to surmount barriers – instead of avoiding or ignoring them – and find ways to take action to do so. © 2017, Masaryk University.

However, copyright law and policy sometimes poses challenges to realizing full and equal access to the web for persons with varying physical, mental, and cognitive disabilities. Recent developments in international law and policy that promote the use of technological protection measures (TPM) as a means for protecting copyrighted digital content on the web create barriers to accessibility for certain individuals with disabilities. This article uses theories of multilevel governance and social regulation to explore the relationship among laws and policies that aim to ensure web accessibility, and laws and policies to preserve and promote the use of TPM. It employs a case study of U.S. law and policy to examine how different levels of governance have ensured and supported the rights of persons with cognitive disabilities and web content publishers. This article argues that the Marrakesh Treaty acts as a bridge between the copyright and human rights regimes, can promote the meaningful participation of persons with an array of cognitive and other disabilities in the design and implementation of national and international copyright laws and policies, and thus fosters harmonization of TPM with the principles of web accessibility. © 2017, Masaryk University.

Interviews were conducted with nine individuals (aged 26-61, three men and six women) with post-stroke aphasia. In addition, a total of 1,581 screenshots of online posts (e.g., photos, videos, text, emoticons) created by the same participants were collected. Drawing on social semiotics (specifically the three dimensions of online communication mentioned by Kress (2003), i.e., composition, content and context) and Goffman’s theory of stigma (1963, specifically the concepts of stigma management and passing), qualitative thematic analysis was performed. Regarding composition, three themes emerged: Relying on others or technology, Beyond speaking and writing, and Controlling speed and timing. The participants rarely posted content about aphasia, but some of them used the Internet to raise awareness. Different online contexts had different meaning to the participants in terms of identity. Being open about the aphasia in one forum did not imply the same behaviour in another forum (e.g., dating sites). For the participants to pass (Goffman, 1963), should they want to, they needed to control all three dimensions. If the context or the composition revealed the stigma, controlling the content was not enough to pass. The multimodality of the Internet enabled the participants to manage their stigma in a variety of ways and to choose whether to be perceived as persons with aphasia or not. © 2017, Masaryk University.

Although the buffering effects of parental mediation of technology use are currently being investigated, little attention has focused on whether parental mediation protects against the depression, anxiety, and loneliness associated with cyber victimization among adolescents with autism spectrum disorders. The present study focused on this gap in the literature by investigating the buffering effect of parental mediation on the associations between cyber victimization and depression, anxiety, and loneliness. Participants were 128 6th through 8th graders from the Midwestern United States (ages range from 11-16 years old; 89% male), and they completed questionnaires on their perceptions of parental mediation of technology use, cyber victimization, face-to-face victimization, depression, loneliness, and anxiety. After controlling for face-to-face victimization, the findings revealed that high levels of perceived parental technology mediation made the relationship between cyber victimization and depression more negative, while lower levels of perceived parental technology mediation made the association more positive. These patterns were not found for anxiety or loneliness. © 2017, Masaryk University.

Such acts can be seen to contravene their Human Rights under The Convention on the Rights of Person with Disabilities (CRPD), which endorses the rights of people with intellectual disability to fully express their sexuality. The purpose of this study was to explore if people with intellectual disability access internet based social media, and if so, if they use it to form relationships that express their sexuality. Using an interpretative phenomenological approach, semi-structured interviews were conducted with 30 adults with an intellectual disability (22 males, 8 females), aged between 20 to 66 years. Participants were purposely sampled though disability organisations. Three themes emerged from the data: creating new friendships, maintaining existing friendships, exploring and expressing sexuality. People with intellectual disability used a variety of personal electronic devices to access internet based social media to be socially and sexually active. Facebook was accessed to make contact with existing platonic friends, peers and interest groups to meet socially. Sexually explicit material was viewed using the internet, either as an individual activity or by couples in monogamous relationships. This study adds to the paucity of research examining the use of internet based social media by people with intellectual disability for sexual expression. This research revealed the people with intellectual disability exercised cyber safe practices without any explicit formal education and conducted themselves in a respectful manner. Few participants acted in a manner that appeared to put them at risk of exploitation. © 2017, Masaryk University.

It also offers new routes to economic and social inclusion for disabled people. Research on the digital divide shows that social factors affect Internet access but disability status is often overlooked. This paper assesses the extent to which disability makes a difference and how it interacts with other social effects to produce distinctive forms of digital exclusion. The analysis uses survey data from 27 European countries to explore and model, statistically, the interactions between Internet access, disability status, age, gender, education, household financial situation and household composition. Multilevel analysis confirms that socio-demographic factors can explain much variance in outcomes but there is a distinctive disability effect. In particular, the adverse effects of financial constraint, aging and living alone are exacerbated among disabled people. New policies to strengthen e-accessibility, arising from the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and from the European Union, are important but cannot ignore those who are still excluded from the online revolution. Disabled people are over-represented in this group. The evidence suggests that both accessible technologies and appropriate supportive relationships are needed to address this. © 2017, Masaryk University.

It ranges from harassment incidents to disability hate crimes, and causes physical, mental and psychosocial consequences. The Internet has further reshaped this phenomenon which lead to “cyber-victimisation” experiences, with no less impact upon victims. This methodology paper focuses mainly on the challenges and implications of using online methods in a UK-based study exploring the impact of cyber-victimisation on people coping with disabilities and chronic conditions. Mixed-method design was adopted via an online-survey followed by in-depth interviewing of victims. Online recruitment was through victim-support groups, patient-support groups, and social media. Out of 80 organisations and charities approached, 51(63.8%) gatekeepers helped to reach participants. Recruitment and data collection process was challenged by four overarching themes: 1) social identity in online support groups, 2) the role of online gatekeepers, 3) the contradictory role of social media, and 4) promoting inclusivity. These challenges were theorised from the perspective of the Social Identity Theory. Representing self as a victim and/or a disabled-person had its implications on virtual groups’ membership, social media use, gatekeepers’ decisions and subsequent participation. Some identity aspects were highlighted as positive points to improve engagement with research. In conclusion, the Internet has aggravated the vulnerability of people with disabilities, but it also has a huge potential in researching sensitive topics with this group. Future research in the cyberspace should acknowledge the challenges of online identities of disabled victimised people, and focus on positive identity aspects to facilitate the research process and encourage collaborative participation at early stages of research. © 2017, Masaryk University.

However, we do know that many of them have limited social circles. Electronic social media could facilitate the development of relationships, increase social participation and reduce social isolation for these people. However it may also expose users to unwanted encounters. Our exploratory study attempts to get a glimpse of Internet experiences of young adults with ID or ASD. Eight participants (five with ID and three with ASD) whose mean age was 25 years participated in this preliminary study. A sociodemographic and Internet use questionnaire was administered with the help of the participants’ support worker. Seven participants agreed to be interviewed by one of the researchers in a separate meeting, in the presence of their support worker. Results show that all participants enjoyed using the Internet for communicating (e.g. Facebook, e-mail, chatrooms, dating sites) or entertainment (e.g. watching videos, listening to music). Three male subjects played games online, and only participants with ASD (without ID) created content (e.g. website or blog). All interviewees with ID and two of the three with ASD had distressing experiences including: being insulted online, having false rumors spread, receiving threats or being targets of sexual cyber-solicitation. Users with ID have had to rely on friends, parents or social workers to avoid or rectify cyber-victimization episodes. Internet access has opened a wide window of opportunity for people with ID and ASD, but more education and support is needed to ensure safe and positive Internet use by this population. © 2017, Masaryk University.

Some authors mention that information and communication technologies (ICT) have the potential to enhance people’s power to act and promote equal citizen participation. These elements are particularly important for people living with intellectual disability (ID). However, it seems that the use of ICT is challenging for these people and that a digital divide has gradually formed between them and the connected citizen. The general objective of this theoretical article is to identify and illustrate the dimensions that must be taken into account to promote the digital participation of people with ID. The model is based on a qualitative analysis of scientific publications using a conceptual-style matrix (Miles & Huberman, 2003). The coding categories were derived from two main sources: the accessibility pyramid and the Human Development Model - Disability Creation Process. Five challenges or conditions associated with digital inclusion were identified: access to digital devices, sensorimotor, cognitive and technical requierements and the comprehension of codes and conventions. For each one, the obstacles and facilitators identified in the literature are described. These reflections and principles led us to propose a model in the shape of a gear. The proper operation of the gear system depends on the fit between individual resources and environmental support. The model is a first step to understand the digital inclusion of people with ID. © 2017, Masaryk University.

This study explores and compares the views of service users and clinicians on how computers can be integrated in psychological therapies for people with ID who are traditionally under-represented in mainstream services. We conducted in-depth unstructured interviews with three clinicians who had experience of working with people with ID and with three adults with ID who have experienced computerised training in cognitive behaviour therapy skills. The interviews explored the a) potential functions and benefits, b) anticipated challenges and barriers, and c) required design features of computers in therapy for people with ID. We used inductive coding to identify independent themes in the responses of clinicians and service users, and then compared the emerging themes between the two sets of participants to arrive at common themes. Six common themes emerged from service user and clinician responses: confidentiality of personal information and online applications, barriers in the communication with the therapist, value of therapist and personal contact, access to computer technologies, engagement potential of computer programmes and home practice. Three further themes were specific to clinician responses: patient suitability for computerised approaches, clinician distrust of computerised interventions, and involving a third party. Computer technologies open up possibilities for psychological therapy with people with ID by helping them overcome in-session communication difficulties and practise skills at home. On-screen pictures, interactive games, symbols, sign language and touch-screen are key design features to help engagement. The main challenges are clinician-reported difficulties in their own capacity and capability to access and use computers and in fitting computers into their own defined roles. © 2017, Masaryk University.

Drawing on existing literature in the field we will identify problems with and gaps in the current research. Our review is framed by three main questions: What constitutes a ‘normal’ life for adolescents and adults with intellectual and developmental disabilities? What constitutes ‘normal’ use of the Internet for adolescents and adults with intellectual and developmental disabilities? How does risk mediate the ability of adolescents and adults with intellectual and developmental disabilities to live a normal life by using the Internet? The key focus of this review is the complex relationship between adolescents and adults with intellectual and developmental disabilities and those providing support; how they negotiate access to and use of the Internet and how perceptions regarding risk and normalcy mediate this negotiation. As a result of this review we will argue that identified gaps and problems in the research field need to be addressed by expanding both methodological and conceptual approaches. In particular we will propose the need for more in-depth qualitative research that is inclusive in nature. We will also propose that an adapted positive risk-taking framework might be useful in framing the design, implementation and analysis of future research. © 2017, Masaryk University.

In particular, it focuses on the role social networking sites may play in the development of polarisation, by exploring how online users respond to explicit online hate materials. Specifically, this article discusses the ways in which a self-selected sample of YouTube users responded, via posting online comments, to a video clip in which a White female train passenger (called Emma) could be seen to racially to abuse other passengers. Thematic analysis of the YouTube comments identified four main themes: (1) Making Sense of Emma, which encapsulated posters' attempts to find explanations for Emma’s behaviour; (2) Meeting Hatred with Hatred, which described posters’ attempts to oppose Emma’s racism by means of resorting to aggressive, hateful language; (3) Us versus Them, which encapsulated posters' tendencies to categorise themselves and other posters into in- and outgroups, based on their particular stance on racism; (4) Contesting Britishness, which expressed posters' attempts to articulate (and contest) what it means to be British. Whilst the current analysis provides some evidence that hateful web content can fuel aggressive and hateful responses, many of the comments analysed here emphasised common group membership, alongside people’s right to claim membership in a particular social category (i.e. Britishness). The current evidence, therefore, suggests that, at least in the specific context of this study, hateful web content may not necessarily lead to an automatic endorsement or escalation of hatred. © 2016, Masaryk University.

Building on a social capital framework and taking into account the affordances of social media, we specifically looked at users’ activities and the structure of their online networks. Users of LinkedIn or other professional SNS consistently reported higher informational benefits than non-users. The number of ties on the SNS used for professional purposes predicted informational benefits half a year later, and strong ties became more important over time. We also found evidence for a reciprocal relationship between strategic networking and informational benefits. For the use variables (frequency of login, reading, activity in groups, posting professional content), we mainly found concurrent associations with informational benefits. The results shed light on the complex interplay of concurrent and longitudinal processes in the relationship between SNS use and professional informational benefits. © 2016, Masaryk University.

A questionnaire to measure these behaviors was developed. We investigated the effects of the Big Five personality traits, sadistic traits, and values on help-giving and moral courage. We found that the willingness to help on the Internet was promoted by open personality, and the relationship was partly moderated by high weekly use of social media. The willingness to act morally courageous was promoted by open personality, inclination toward sadism, and self-transcendence values. Surprisingly, the relationship between moral courage and sadistic traits was not moderated by the time spent online. Willingness to donate to a charity was fostered by benevolence and universalism values. Future studies will need to replicate the results with behavioral observations. © 2016, Masaryk University.

Social media websites provide a relevant context in which to study androcentrism since many websites aim to provide users with an ostensibly gender-neutral icon if users do not upload one of their own images. In our first study, 50 male and female online participants (Mage = 35.70) rated whether actual avatar icons from highly trafficked social media websites are perceived as gender-neutral. Using bi-polar scales from woman to man participants reported that overall the icons appeared to be more male-typed than gender-neutral. In Study 2, we investigated whether adding more female-typed icons would discourage or promote androcentric thinking. An online sample of 608 male and female participants (Mage = 33.76) viewed either 12 avatar icons that reflected the over-representation of male-typed icons or 12 that included an equal number of male and female-typed icons. Participants were then asked to produce an example of a typical person. Finally, we measured political ideology on two liberal-conservative scales. We found evidence that exposure to an equal number of male-typed and female-typed avatar icons generated reactance among political conservatives, and thus may have constituted an ideological threat. Conservatives who saw an equal number of male-typed and female-typed icons were twice as likely to come up with a man as a typical person compared to conservatives who saw an over-representation of male-typed avatar icons. Consistent with system-justification theory, these findings show how male-centric thinking is also evident in a seemingly gender-neutral online context. © 2016, Masaryk University.

Currently however, there is a lack of research on the utilisation of these online resources. Therefore, the aim of this study was to examine the use of these online resources by employing online data collection techniques. A quantitative online survey was used to investigate the range of online recovery resources used, and to compare the types of resources used at different stages of the substance misuse recovery journey. Qualitative online interviews were also conducted to investigate how individuals use these online resources alongside traditional offline recovery resources. Analyses revealed that forums were the most widely accessed online resource, however participants who were currently working towards abstinence were more likely to use therapeutic resources that explore the underlying causes behind substance misuse and help to manage these difficulties. Qualitative findings suggested an interaction between online and offline recovery resources. For example, participants reported that online resources may provide initial contact information for offline recovery meetings, or that offline support with developing digital skills may facilitate access to online resources. Despite these apparent benefits, there is limited signposting advice to direct people to appropriate online treatment and recovery resources for their substance misuse, so it is hoped that the findings from this study will help to inform future research around the production of such signposting advice. © 2016, Masaryk University.

Seven hundred and sixty-seven people participated in the study (Mage = 26.10 ± 6.73 years; 22% male), for which they completed the Smartphone Addiction Scale (E-SAS-33; Rozgonjuk, Rosenvald, &amp; Täht, 2016), the Estonian Internet Addiction Test (E-IAT; based on Young, 1998), and the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS; Kwon, Lee, et al., 2013). Exploratory factor analysis (maximum likelihood with geomin rotation) and confirmatory factor analysis (parameter estimation: Maximum likelihood), an internal-consistency test, t- tests for mean comparisons, correlation analysis and experts’ opinions were used to shorten the E-SAS-33 and validate a new version of the scale. The results of the analyses showed that the 18-item test with five subscales (“tolerance”, “positive anticipation”, “cyberspace-oriented relationships”, “withdrawal”, and “physical symptoms”) has sound psychometric properties and that the content of the subscales is similar to the original. Among the results, statistically significant differences in E-SAPS18 scores were found in gender, age, level of education, smartphone main use and self-reported addiction. Furthermore, correlates suggest that smartphone addiction, social media use, and Internet addiction might share a similar underlying mechanism. © 2016, Masaryk University.

At the same time, these concerns do not appear to generate a corresponding wave of privacy protection behavior. A number of studies have addressed the apparent divergence between users’ privacy concerns and behavior, with results varying according to context. Previous research has examined user trust, lack of risk awareness and the privacy calculus as potential solutions to the “privacy paradox”. Complementing these perspectives, we propose that some users faced with seemingly overwhelming privacy threats develop an attitude of “privacy cynicism”, leading to a resigned neglect of protection behavior. Privacy cynicism serves as a cognitive coping mechanism, allowing users to rationalize taking advantage of online services despite serious privacy concerns. We conduct an interdisciplinary literature review to define the core concept, then empirically substantiate it based on qualitative data collected among German Internet users. © 2016, Masaryk University.

In the case of internet gaming addiction, on one hand, higher impulsivity and sensation seeking have been reported in problematic online gamers. On the other hand, problematic online gamers were also identified as introverted, socially anxious, and generally inhibited in behaviour. Our study investigates the role of dysfunctional impulsivity in gaming addiction. A sample of 1,510 Czech and Slovak online gamers completed a questionnaire that was advertised online and targeted the core of the gaming community. Internet gaming addiction was measured using the Addiction-Engagement Questionnaire (Charlton & Danforth, 2010). Dysfunctional impulsivity was measured using the 11 items of Dickman’s (1990) sub-scale of the Impulsivity Inventory. Pearson’s correlation coefficients were calculated for variables and a regression model was constructed using hierarchical linear regression to determine the association between online gaming addiction and dysfunctional impulsivity, while controlling for age, gender, and the frequency of online gaming. A set of chi-square tests was employed to compare the patterns of addiction criteria among highly impulsive addicted gamers and non-impulsive addicted gamers. Although dysfunctional impulsivity was a good predictor of gaming addiction (β = .252), it actually explained only about 7% of the addiction variance. Problematic gamers high on impulsivity had similar patterns of addiction criteria as non-impulsive gamers, with only one exception – they had a significantly higher tendency to relapse. There was no role of impulsivity in gaming engagement. The results suggest that dysfunctional impulsivity is a risk factor for online gaming addiction (similar to other addictions), but it does not have prominent explanatory value in itself. Also, the results show that problematic gamers high on impulsivity are more prone to relapse and reinstatement. © 2007-2016 Cyberpsychology: Journal of Psychosocial Research on Cyberspace.","Dysfunctional impulsivity; Gaming addiction; Gaming engagement; Impulsivity; Internet gaming disorder",,,,,,,,,,"(2013) Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, , 5th ed.).

In our sample of 276 U.S. adults, men engaged in most of these online sexual activities significantly more than women, but women were just as likely as men to send sexually-explicit pictures to online chat partners, and they were also just as likely as men to demonstrate signs of internet addiction. More importantly, using pornography and sex site usage were sequential mediators in the relationship between Internet addiction and engagement in risky online sexual activities. Moreover, whereas pornography viewing alone was not a predictor of risky online sexual activities, when the behavior escalated to engaging in Internet sex chat sites it did predict engagement in sexting or expectations of offline sex with those known only online. Based on these findings, we suggest that although these behaviors might be considered under one umbrella of online sexual activity, it might be useful from an intervention and treatment standpoint to target specific online sexual activities (e.g., sex site usage). © 2007-2016 Cyberpsychology: Journal of Psychosocial Research on Cyberspace.","Internet addiction; Online erotica; Online sexual behaviors; Risky sexual behavior; Sexting",,,,,,,,,,"(2013) Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, , 5th ed.).

Not all adolescents use chatting for the same purpose, however, and these links may not be as pronounced for socially anxious adolescents as they likely communicate with others online in order to compensate for offline social inadequacies. The current study investigated whether social anxiety moderated the links between excessive chatting and compulsive Internet use over time. Using a sample of 523 early adolescents (269 girls; Mage = 14.00) from a 3-wave longitudinal study, the links between excessive chatting and compulsive Internet use were investigated via manifest autoregressive models, and moderating effects of social anxiety were tested via multiple-group comparison procedures. The results showed bidirectional links between excessive chatting and compulsive Internet use from Time 2–Time 3, as excessive chatting predicted more symptoms of compulsive Internet use, whereas compulsive Internet use predicted more excessive chatting – over and above the effects of gender. These links were present for adolescents low on social anxiety, but they were largely missing for highly socially anxious adolescents. Thus, social anxiety may have protective effects for early adolescents who spend too much time chatting online, as it may help reduce the risk of developing symptoms of compulsive Internet use. © 2007-2016 Cyberpsychology: Journal of Psychosocial Research on Cyberspace.","Compulsive internet use; Early adolescence; Excessive chatting; Social anxiety; Synchronous communication",,,,,,,,,,"Amichai-Hamburger, Y., Ben-Artzi, E., (2003) Loneliness and Internet Use.

However, these concepts have yet to be empirically explored. The present paper addresses this gap in the literature by presenting a pilot study based on a sample of 59 (50 females, 9 males) problematic Facebook users. Closed and open-ended data were collected using an online survey. Cluster analysis was then used to identify three types of problematic Facebook users: those with high engagement in social activities and browsing, those with low engagement in social activities but high engagement in browsing, and those with low engagement in both social activities and browsing, but moderate engagement in gaming. This paper presents an in depth discussion of the patterns of behavior identified within these clusters. In addition, four potential pathways to problematic Facebook use are proposed: online social enhancement, social monitoring, procrastination, and entertainment.

I used a content analysis of 800 Instagram posts and compared how both communities conveyed their social identities and provided social support. I found that fat acceptance members identified with their community through hashtags related to positivity and self-love, while pro-anorexics identified with their community through posts related to “thinspiration” and negativity. Members of the fat acceptance community distinguished against outsiders by attempting to reframe beauty, while members of the pro-anorexic community distinguished against outsiders by arguing with recovered anorexics. Lastly, both communities provided support by complimenting users’ appearances and providing informational resources on how to maintain one’s body image. Members of the pro-anorexic community also circulated network support by promoting the weight-loss buddy system of “ana buddies.” I propose for future researchers to triangulate these findings with interviews and ethnographic studies to further understand community values. This knowledge provides useful insight into the way in which stigmatized communities use technology to maintain their social identities and enhance their support. © 2016, Masaryk University.

The sample consisted of 1,890 preadolescents and adolescents aged 10 to 18 years, 72.1% of them with an SNS account. All participants had to describe a good friend whom they meet predominantly offline. The participants with an SNS account additionally had to describe a good SNS friend whom they meet predominantly online. Questionnaires were used to assess perceived friendship quality and the topics primarily discussed with friends. The results showed that participating at an SNS was not connected to friendship quality. However, participants without an SNS account discussed personal problems less often with their offline friends. Participants who reported having an SNS account perceived higher offline compared to online friendship quality. Additionally, female sex, initial offline contact, and frequency of contact had a positive effect on online and offline friendship quality. © 2016, Masaryk University.

Data were gathered using semi-structured interviews with 20 postgraduate and undergraduate students identified as highly health anxious, and were examined using thematic analysis. Results suggested that themes were organized by different stages of the search process. Reasons for searching included curiosity, anxiety/worry about undiagnosed symptoms, and remedy-seeking. Both positive (e.g. reassurance) and negative (e.g. uncertainty) outcomes were reported. Findings from the current study suggest that the Internet constitutes an important resource for obtaining health information by health anxious individuals, with the potential to both reduce and exacerbate health anxiety. © 2016, Masaryk University.

Emerging work on computer gaming shows that games can also influence social attitudes. The present studies investigated the influence of an interactive computer game about living in poverty on attitudes and beliefs about the poor. Playing the poverty game was compared to playing a control game and merely observing the poverty game. In Study 1, playing an interactive poverty game did not influence attitudes while watching someone else play the game increased positive attitudes, empathic concern, and support for government-funded anti-poverty policies. In Study 2, meritocracy beliefs moderated the influence of the game; people lower in meritocracy showed less positive attitudes toward the poor after playing the poverty game. This effect was mediated by an increase in the belief that poverty is personally controllable. Future directions for and implications of studying the unique intergroup effects of games are discussed. © 2016, Masaryk University.

However, empirical research that explores the selfie-associated personal characteristics of individuals is still scant. In the present study, the author aims to investigate four personal characteristics that might explain why some individuals like to take selfies more than others. They include the following: (1) narcissism, (2) attention-seeking behavior, (3) self-centered behavior, and (4) loneliness. Questionnaire data were collected from a sample of 300 students from a public university in Thailand; the majority of students were ages between 21 to 24 years old. The results from partial least square regression showed that the degree of selfie-liking that the respondents reported was positively associated with all of these characteristics. The overall findings imply that, although selfies provide the opportunity for individuals to enhance self-disclosure, they can reflect some unhealthy behavior on their part. © 2016, Masaryk University.

The analysis focused on both cross-national and socio-demographic differences and on user characteristic including happiness, previous online and offline victimization and online user activity. German respondents had significantly lower levels of exposure to harm-advocating online content than respondents in the three other countries. Females were more likely to be exposed to eating disorder content, while males witnessed more self-injury and suicide content across all four countries. Younger respondents were more likely to be exposed to such material. In addition, other socio-demographic background variables (not living with parents, immigrant background, city residence, online activity) and personal characteristics associated with negative self-schemata were significant predictors of exposure to such content.

In this study 12 focus groups were organized with a total of 78 adolescents and young adults of local Flemish youth organizations to discuss their privacy practices. Findings describe how different strategies are used to coordinate the group information flow. The study also shows how online group privacy management can be challenging because ‘implicit’ privacy rules need to be made ‘explicit’, personal boundaries may conflict with those of the group one belongs to and privacy turbulence is difficult to define. © 2016, Masaryk University.

Although one might easily be inclined to think that young people do not care about their privacy, an explanation for this could be that young people simply have a different idea of what privacy entails. This study aims to investigate the underlying mechanisms that may explain differences in privacy concerns between younger and older people and between users and non-users of social network sites (SNSs). 1.008 users of SNS and 712 non-users participated in the study with a stratified distribution over adolescents, young adults, and adults. The results show that the difference in perceived risk-benefit balance partly mediates the relationship between use or non-use of SNSs and concern. SNS users are less concerned because they perceive more benefits relative to risks. Concern regarding privacy between young and old was mediated by their differences in privacy conceptions. Older individuals were more likely to associate situations related to personal information with privacy. In turn, these individuals reported more concern regarding their privacy. © 2016, Masaryk University.

While considerable research has been conducted with teenagers and young adults, scant attention has been paid to differences among adult age groups regarding privacy management behavior. With a multidimensional approach to privacy attitudes, we investigate Facebook use, privacy attitudes, online privacy literacy, disclosure, and privacy protective behavior on Facebook across three adult age groups (18-40, 41-65, and 65+). The sample consisted of an online convenience sample of 518 adult Facebook users. Comparisons suggested that although age groups were comparable in terms of general Internet use and online privacy literacy, younger groups were more likely to use SNSs more frequently, use Facebook for social interaction purposes, and have larger networks. Also, younger adults were more likely to self-disclose and engage in privacy protective behaviors on Facebook. In terms of privacy attitudes, older age groups were more likely to be concerned about privacy of other individuals. In general, all dimensions of privacy attitudes (i.e., belief that privacy is a right, being concerned about one’s privacy, belief that one’s privacy is contingent on others, being concerned about protecting privacy of others) were positively correlated with engagement in privacy protective behavior on Facebook. A mediation model demonstrated that amount of disclosure mediated the relationship between age groups and privacy protective behavior on Facebook. Finally, ANCOVA suggested that the impact of privacy attitudes on privacy protective behavior was stronger among mature adults. Also, unlike older age groups, among young adults, considering privacy as a right or being concerned about privacy of other individuals had no impact on privacy protective behavior. © 2016, Masaryk University.

Previous researchers have demonstrated that it is possible to develop ambient awareness, that is, knowledge of others, after browsing social media, but it is still unclear whether and to what extent Twitter users also experience ambient intimacy, i.e., emotional closeness to others stemming from merely following them on Twitter. This paper is the first to theoretically distinguish the concept of ambient intimacy from ambient awareness. The paper investigates the degree to which Twitter users experience ambient awareness and intimacy. Moreover, we also examine the role of interaction history and message characteristics in this process. The results showed that Twitter users had experienced ambient intimacy but to a lesser degree than ambient awareness; the majority felt close to only a limited number of people in their Twitter network. Visibility of tweets and one-sided interaction with the target person predicted ambient intimacy. In addition, users were more likely to experience ambient intimacy toward a person when his or her tweets were perceived as more intimate, entertaining, and informative. © 2016, Masaryk University.

While shared information is co-constructed by self and others, personal and collective privacy boundaries become blurred. Thus there is an increasing concern over information privacy beyond the individual perspective. However, limited research has empirically examined if individuals are concerned about privacy loss not only of their own but their social ties’; nor is there an established instrument for measuring the collective aspect of individuals’ privacy concerns. In order to address this gap in existing literature, we propose a conceptual framework of individuals’ collective privacy concerns in the context of SNSs. Drawing on the Communication Privacy Management (CPM) theory (Petronio, 2002), we suggest three dimensions of collective privacy concerns, namely, collective information access, control and diffusion. This is followed by the development and empirical validation of a preliminary scale of SNS collective privacy concerns (SNSCPC). Structural model analyses confirm the three-dimensional conceptualization of SNSCPC and reveal antecedents of SNS users’ concerns over violations of the collective privacy boundaries. This paper serves as a starting point for theorizing privacy as a collective notion and for understanding online information disclosure as a result of social interaction and group influence. © 2016, Masaryk University.

For communication scholars and practitioners, this recent attitudinal shift indicates a critical need to better understand consumer perceptions related to personalized advertising in the era of big data. It is currently assumed that U.S. self-regulatory initiatives, including the AdChoices Icon, reduce perceived risk by giving consumers a greater sense of control over the exchange of their personal information online (Castro, 2011). However, less than 37% of U.S. Internet users are familiar with the AdChoices Icon (eMarketer, 2015), and 52% incorrectly believe that privacy policies ensure the confidentiality of their personal information (Pew, 2014). To examine the complexities of the privacy paradox, the present study utilizes a 2×2×2 experiment (N = 382) to measure attitudes toward personalized advertising with and without the presence of the AdChoices Icon. A Univariate GLM analysis of the data indicate that when controlling for demographics, online trust, message credibility, and perceived risks and benefits, advertising personalization did not have a significant effect on attitude toward the ad, but inclusion of the AdChoices Icon did. Further, respondents indicating no knowledge of the AdChoices Icon reported lower attitudinal responses toward the ad compared to those who were knowledgeable of its meaning. Exploring these complex relationships offers to advance research and practice by extending Persuasion Knowledge Model to examine the effects of personalized online message delivery, as well as offering practitioners actionable insights to improve their personalized advertising outcomes. © 2016, Masaryk University.

Its premise is that most video games are, either implicitly or explicitly, heteronormative and the inscribed player of such games is in the majority of cases a heterosexual male. In order to achieve the same level of identification with an avatar and to enjoy a similar gameplay experience as the heterosexual player, the LGBT player may have to deploy various strategies to challenge the game and work around it, or to find the LGBT content which some more progressive games offer. The study is based on in-depth qualitative interviews with six players (5 males and 1 female) who identified themselves both as homosexual and as players of the Mass Effect or Dragon Age series, games that include several opportunities to initiate same-sex romance. We have identified three different queer playing strategies: imaginative play (queer reading of unspecified or heterosexual characters), stylized performance (the use of gay stereotypes to mark one as queer) and role-playing of a LGBT character. However, players do not seek sexuality in games to the same extent as they do in film or TV, and they tend to use these strategies, and especially the latter two, reluctantly or with reservations. These reservations may be linked to our finding that LGBT players consider their gay (or lesbian) identities disconnected from their identities as players or gamers. This can be explained by the mutual exclusivity of gay communities and the heteronormative game culture. © 2007-2015 Cyberpsychology: Journal of Psychosocial Research on Cyberspace.","Gender; Heteronormativity; LGBT community; Queer playing; Video games",,,,,,,,,,"Anthropy, A., (2012) Dys4ia, , Adobe Flash.

Workplaces are incorporating increasing varieties of concurrent and emerging games; some of these games are directly linked to how employees are projected to produce value for an organization and are paid and promoted, while others can be recreational, educational, or even medical (involving health diagnosis or treatment). In effect, many workplace settings have become the platforms for multiple, sometimes interlocking sets of rules, enforcement mechanisms, and related gaming structures. “Multigamification” approaches explicitly recognize game-related complexities and interactions, and provide means for mitigating cognitive overload, character conflicts, and other concerns. Participants can be immersed in technology-enhanced games that infuse social, medical, and economic themes either as a part of strategic initiatives in gamification (and multigamification, as described in this paper) or through emergent and less-tightly structured efforts. The overall wellbeings of organizational participants may relate in some way in how they engage in specific games as well as to how they deal with multiple games either in sequence or simultaneously; one or more games can be designated as “work” and others as “play,” sometimes reflecting traditional narratives that contrast labor deemed as “productive” with recreation. Developers can become active in exploring and tailoring games for specific workplace contexts, addressing issues of intergame compatibility, theme interaction, and synergy as well as participant overload. Multigamification can involve forms of competition among the games themselves as they compete for the limited attention of participants. This paper also addresses the challenging policy and design issues related to workplace games’ effects on participant wellbeing. Emergence of nested and overlapping gaming spheres can increase the complexity of organizational life as well as expand its ludic dimensions. © 2007-2015 Cyberpsychology: Journal of Psychosocial Research on Cyberspace.","Employee wellbeing; Gamification; Multigamification; Multitasking; Serious games; Surveillance; Workplace recreation",,,,,,,,,,"Anable, A., Casual games, time management, and the work of affect (2013) Ada: A Journal of Gender, New Media, and Technology, 6 (2). , http://adanewmedia.org/2013/06/issue2-anable/, Retrieved from; Andersen, N.A., (2009) Power at Play: The Relationships between Play, Work and Governance, , New York: Palgrave Macmillan; Banks, J., (2013) Co-Creating Videogames, , London: Bloomsbury Publishing; Bannister, R., Remenyi, D., Multitasking: The uncertain impact of technology on knowledge workers and managers (2009) Electronic Journal Information Systems Evaluation, 12, pp. 1-12. , http://www.ejise.com, Retrieved from; Beck, J.C., Wade, M., (2004) Got Game: How the Gamer Generation is Reshaping Business Forever, , Cambridge, MA: Harvard Business School Press; Bogost, I., Gamification is bullshit (2011) Paper Presented at for the Win: Serious Gamification, , Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; Bogost, I., Why gamification is bullshit 2 (2015) The Gameful World: Approaches, pp. 65-79. , S.

Emotions sit at the heart of a game player’s level of engagement. They are evoked across many of the components that facilitate gameplay including the interface, the player’s avatar, non-player characters and narrative. Understanding the role of emotion in creating truly immersive and believable environments is critical for game designers. After discussing a taxonomy of emotion, this paper will present a systematic literature review of designing for emotion in computer games. Following this, a conceptual framework for affective design is offered as a guide for the future of computer game design. © 2007-2015 Cyberpsychology: Journal of Psychosocial Research on Cyberspace.","Affective computing; Computer games; Emotion; Framework; Game design",,,,,,,,,,"Baillie, P., (2002) The Synthesis of Emotions in Artificial Intelligences, , (Doctoral dissertation).

Opportunities for customization may give users decision-making authority over the technology, enabling them to shape and create their own experiences, as well as provide ways to be a part of a group based on their needs and desires. This study aims to shed more light on the effects customization has on players’ motivation, and investigates how customization as a way of user control affects player motivation within an MMO. A mixed method study was designed with two conditions: customization (n = 33) and no customization (n = 33). Adult participants played Lord of the Rings Online (LotRO), a Massively Multiplayer Online game, for about ten hours over four sessions. Data was collected through surveys, interviews and observations. Results showed that players’ desire to replay the game increased over time, and customization affected players’ motivation positively.

This approach, however, may limit a game’s persuasive impact and ability to produce beneficial outcomes, particularly when the apparent aims of the game trigger players’ psychological defenses or reduce players’ potential engagement with-and enjoyment of-the game experience. In contrast, the “Embedded Design” approach that we introduce here offers effective, evidence-based strategies for more stealthily or covertly delivering persuasive content in a game in a fashion that circumvents players’ psychological defenses and triggers a more receptive mindset. This paper provides an in-depth exploration of two key Embedded Design strategies: (1) intermixing: combining “on-topic” and “off-topic” game content in order to make the focal message or theme less obvious and more accessible and (2) obfuscating: using game genres or framing devices that direct players’ attention or expectations away from the game’s true aims. To illustrate the implementation and effectiveness of these strategies, we detail the design of two games that utilize a number of these techniques to reduce stereotypes and biases and present the methods and results of a set of empirical studies testing the prosocial impact of these games. In addition, we introduce a number of other Embedded Design strategies that have emerged in our work and discuss the most viable contexts for the use of this design approach. © 2007-2015 Cyberpsychology: Journal of Psychosocial Research on Cyberspace.","Embedded design; Game design; Perspective-taking; Prejudice; Prosocial games; Stereotypes",,,,,,"National Science Foundation, NSF: 1137483

Data were collected in an online survey among German (n = 1303) and Polish (n = 1135) university students aged 18-26 years. Polish students were more religious, showed a greater acceptance of sexual myths, and reported a higher level of sex taboos in their origin families. Polish students were younger at their first contact with pornography, while German students used pornographic materials more often. Results suggested a link between sociocultural background, especially religiosity, and pornography engagement. The relationship between pornography use and religiosity was ambiguous. On the one hand, attending church was negatively associated with age at first contact and pornography use. On the other hand, the association of intrinsic religiosity with pornography use proved to be contradictory: it was correlated with a lower frequency of pornography use for females and with a higher frequency for males. The agreement with common sexual myths was related to a higher frequency of pornography use. There was no association between the level of sex taboos and pornography use. © 2007-2015 Cyberpsychology.","Pornography; Religiosity; Sexual socialization; Sexually explicit materials; Young adults",,,,,,,,,,"Abell, J.W., Steenbergh, T.A., Boivin, M.J., Cyberporn use in the context of religiosity (2006) Journal of Psychology & Theology, 34, pp. 165-171; Agocha, V.B., Asencio, M., Decena, C.U., Sexuality and culture (2014) APA Handbook of Sexuality and Psychology: Vol. 2.

Seventeen studies meeting the inclusion criteria are summarized in a systematic synopsis. Sixteen studies focus on self-initiated blogging in informal contexts. Only one study examines mandated weblog writing for coping in an institutionalized context. Results indicate that the public nature of weblogs opens up a variety of possibilities for both problem-focused and emotion-focused coping, most importantly through social support. Although these studies show promising results, it remains unclear if and how the benefits of self-initiated blogging can be transferred to more formal settings. Thus, future research should examine how blogging can be mandated and scaffolded in order to foster coping strategies and decrease stress levels. For this purpose, experimentally controlled and longitudinal studies are needed to evaluate the effectiveness of this approach. © 2007-2015 Cyberpsychology.","Blogging; Coping; Review; Stress; Weblogs; Writing therapy",,,,,,,,,,"Abdo, S.N., Pashnyak, T.G., Dennen, V.P., Medical students’ international blogging community: A coping mechanism to survive the difficult years of medical school (2011) International Journal of Web Based Communities, 7, pp. 342-356. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1504/IJWBC.2011.041203; Aldwin, C.M., (2007) Stress, Coping, and Development: An Integrative Perspective, , New York, NY: The Guilford Press; Anderson-Butcher, D., Lasseigne, A., Ball, A., Brzozowski, M., Lehnert, M., Mc Cormick, B.L., Adolescent weblog use: Risky or protective?

The present study intends to expand on the current understanding of the linkage between social networking site use and mental health. Our study explored how Facebook use may be associated with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), with the inclusion of obsessive-compulsive beliefs as a mediator. One hundred and fifty-six undergraduate students completed the questionnaire given. Overall, Facebook use contributed to OCD severity through obsessive-compulsive beliefs as the mediator.

Using a factorial design, the study examined the effects of three online situational factors—anonymity, invisibility, and lack of eye contact—on inducing self-disclosure and prosocial behaviors as expressions of benign online disinhibition. Random pairs of adult strangers (n = 144) discussed a dilemma and were required to reach a joint solution using online chat. Self-disclosure and prosocial behavior effects were measured using participants’ self-reports, expert judges’ ratings of chat transcripts, and textual analyses of the conversations. Results suggested that the interaction between anonymity and invisibility had a significant effect on the revealing of emotions. Lack of eye contact, the interaction between anonymity and invisibility and the interaction between lack of eye contact and invisibility had a significant effect on the inducement of first-person words. The interaction between anonymity, invisibility and lack of eye contact had significant effects on the total self-disclosure score, yet no significant effects were found for prosocial behaviors. A discussion of the findings with regard to previous research on toxic online disinhibition suggests that different factors play a role in the inducement of benign vs. toxic online disinhibition effects. More research is required to substantiate current findings and determine the nature of the contribution of each situational factor. © 2007-2015 Cyberpsychology.","Anonymity; Benign disinhibition; Eye contact; Invisibility; Online communication",,,,,,,,,,"Altman, I., Taylor, D.A., (1973) Social Penetration: The Development of Interpersonal Relationships, , New York: Holt, Rinehart & Winston; Amichai-Hamburger, Y., Personality, individual differences and Internet use (2007) Oxford Handbook of Internet Psychology, pp. 187-204. , A.

Participants (N = 312, 60.58% female, Mage = 29.77, SD = 10.53) reported on demographics, SL usage, and rated the attractiveness of female and male avatars manipulated along physical attractiveness (high vs. low) and status (high vs. low). Mixed measures ANCOVAs were modeled separately for the female avatars and male avatars with within-subjects factors (avatar characteristics: physical attractiveness and status) and between-subject factors (participant characteristics: sex, and intensity of SL usage), while controlling for participant age. Consistent with offline norms, female avatars high in physical attractiveness were rated as more attractive, regardless of status. Participants rated male avatars high in physical attractiveness as more attractive if they were high in status compared to those low in status. We also found opposite-sex preferences and moderations by participant age and SL usage on avatar attractiveness ratings. The results suggest the continuity of offline gender norms and effect of in-world experience on perceptions of avatar appearance. © 2007-2015 Cyberpsychology.","Attractiveness; Avatars; Gender norms; Status; Virtual worlds",,,,,,,,,,"Arnett, J.J., Emerging adulthood: A theory of development from the late teens through the twenties (2000) American Psychologist, 55, pp. 469-480; Bailenson, J.N., Beall, A.C., Transformed social interaction: Exploring the digital plasticity of avatars (2006) Avatars at Work and Play, pp. 1-16; Baker-Sperry, L., Grauerholz, L., The pervasiveness and persistence of the feminine beauty ideal in children's fairy tales (2003) Gender &Amp; Society, 17, pp. 711-726. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0891243203255605; Baumann, S., The moral underpinnings of beauty: A meaning-based explanation for light and dark complexions in advertising (2008) Poetics, 36 (1), pp. 2-23. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.poetic.2007.11.002; Behm-Morawitz, E., Mirrored selves: The influence of self-presence in a virtual world on health, appearance, and well-being (2013) Computers in Human Behavior, 29, pp. 119-128. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chb.2012.07.023; Blinka, L., Mikuška, J., The role of social motivation and sociability of gamers in online game addiction (2014) Cyberpsychology: Journal of Psychosocial Research on Cyberspace, 8 (2). , http://dx.doi.org/10.5817/CP2014-2-6, article 6; Boellstorff, T., (2008) Coming of Age in Second Life: An Anthropologist Explores the Virtually Human.

Teachers are acknowledged to be important socializing agents, affecting young people`s experiences with digital technology, but it is still unclear how the mediation practices of teachers are related to such intrinsic factors as teachers` beliefs about the nature of learning, nature of technology, self-efficacy beliefs, and subject cultures. Our study indicates that teachers mainly act as guides or coaches to help students make sense of the various opportunities that digital technology provide. Teachers also use a variety of restrictions related to technology use according to their dominant pedagogical beliefs and subject domains. These two roles are not mutually exclusive, combining according to what teachers believe will best support learning. A small group of teachers in our sample also strive to broaden students` understanding and adopt new skills for using technology in innovative ways. Implications for teacher training and peer-to-peer learning are discussed based on our findings. © 2008 Cyberpsychology: Journal of Psychosocial Research on Cyberspace.","Digital technology; Subject cultures; Teachers as mediating agents; Teachers' beliefs; Teachers' practices",,,,,,,,,,"Bandura, A., (1997) Self-efficacy: The exercise of control, , New York: W.H.

The analyses reveal that the parents’ experiences of problems is associated with negative views on media effects, the presence of older siblings living at home and occur especially when their child is active on social media. Parents’ feelings of competence are enhanced by positive views on media effects, older children being present in the home, and the involvement of the young child in educational games and media skill level. Parents feel less confident if their child is active on social media. Support is primarily dependent on the level of problems at hand. Moreover, professionals are consulted especially when parents feel less competent, their child is active on social media and no older siblings are present at home. Parents ask family or friends for advice when they have a negative view on media effects. © 2008 Cyberpsychology: Journal of Psychosocial Research on Cyberspace.","Media diffusion; Parental mediation; Parenting support",,,,,,,,,,"Abelman, Fighting the war on indecency: Mediating TV, internet, and videogame usage among achieving and underachieving gifted children (2007) Roeper Review, 29, pp. 100-112. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02783190709554393; Afifi, W.A., Weiner, J.L., Toward a theory of motivated information management (2004) Communication Theory, 14, pp. 167-190. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1468-2885.2004.tb00310.x; Barr, R., Hayne, H., It's not what you know, it's who you know: Older siblings facilitate imitation during infancy (2003) International Journal of Early years Education, 11, pp. 7-21. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/0966976032000066055; Belsky, J., The determinants of parenting: A process model (1984) Child Development, 55, pp. 83-96. , http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1129836; Blake, J., Family size and the quality of children (1981) Demography, 18, pp. 421-442. , http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/2060941; Böcking, S., Böcking, T., Parental mediation of television: Test of a German-speaking scale and findings on the impact of parental attitudes, sociodemographic and family-factors in German-speaking Switzerland (2009) Journal of Children and Media, 3, pp. 286-302. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/17482790902999959; Caceres-Delpiano, J., The impacts of family size on investment in child quality (2006) Journal of Human Resources, 49, pp. 738-754; CBS, (2013) Dutch population better educated, , http://www.cbs.nl/en-GB/menu/themas/onderwijs/publicaties/artikelen/archief/2013/2013-3905-wm.htm?Languageswitch=on, CBS Statistics Netherlands.

Analyses were carried out in three steps using quantitative and qualitative methods. Firstly, based on EU Kids Online survey data, gendered patterns in parental mediation across European countries were explored. Secondly, detailed analysis of mediation practices in Estonia, one country in the EU Kids Online survey, was carried out. As the last step, data from two focus group interviews were used for in-depth analysis of Estonian mothers’ everyday practices of mediating their children’s internet use. Quantitative analysis revealed significant correlations between the number of gender differences in parental mediation, and country-level variables of internet penetration and gender equality. In Estonia, as a country with low gender equality, but high internet use, mediation strategies do not depend purely on children’s gender, but on a more complex interrelation of gender and children’s and parents’ socio-demographic characteristics and parent-child interactions. This finding was supported and explained by qualitative analysis, showing that Estonian mothers’ methods for mediating boys’ and girls’ internet use differ in several aspects, reflecting the broader context of changing socialization practices, gender norms, and the generation gap in using digital technologies. © 2008 Cyberpsychology: Journal of Psychosocial Research on Cyberspace.","Cultural values; Gender ideologies; Parental mediation; Socialization",,,,,,,,,,"Aavik, K., Uusma, H., Laste sotsialiseerimine, kogumikus (2014) Soolise võrdõiguslikkuse monitooring 2013, pp. 26-36. , http://www.sm.ee/sites/default/files/content-editors/Ministeerium_kontaktid/Uuringu_ja_analuusid/Sotsiaalvaldkond/sooline_vo_monitooring_2013_veeb.pdf, [Socialisation of children.

It focuses on young people’s engagement with the construction of an online identity on social media through pictures, and explores how peer-mediated conventions of self-presentation are appropriated, legitimated, or resisted in pre-teens’ and teenagers’ discourses. In doing so, we draw on Goffman’s (1959) work on the presentation of self and “impression management” to frame our analysis. Mobile communication and social network sites serve an important role in the process of self-presentation and emancipation, providing “full-time” access to peers and peer culture. Our findings suggest that there are gender differences and the presence of sexual double standards in peer normative discourses. Girls are positioned as being more subjected to peer mediation and pressure. Boys blame girls for posing sexy in photos, and negatively sanction this behaviour as being aimed at increasing one’s popularity online or as an indicator of “a certain type of girl.” However, girls who post provocative photos chose to conform to a sexualised stereotype as a means of being socially accepted by peers. Moreover, they identify with the pressure to always look “perfect” in their online pictures. While cross-national variations do exist, this sexual double standard is observed in all three countries. These insights into current behaviours could be further developed to determine policy guidance for supporting young people as they learn to manage image laden social media. © 2008 Cyberpsychology: Journal of Psychosocial Research on Cyberspace.","Peer mediation; Self-presentation; Selfies; Social network sites; Young people",,,,,,,,,,"Attwood, F., (2009) Mainstreaming sex: The sexualisation of Western culture, , London: Taurus; Bond, E., (2014) Childhood, mobile technologies and everyday experiences, , Basingstoke: Palgrave MacMillan; Bosch, T., Young women and 'technologies of the self': Social networking and sexualities (2011) Agenda, 25 (4), pp. 75-86; Boyd, D., Why youth (heart) social network sites: The role of networked publics in teenage social life (2007) Youth, Identity and Digital Media, pp. 119-142. , D.

One prominent factor receiving attention is the role of parental mediation in adolescents’ digital technology usage, and how such mediation reduces the risk of cyber victimization. Less attention has focused on different mitigating agents (i.e., teachers, friends) and their influence on adolescents’ cyber victimization. Another area that has received little attention is the buffering effects of different mitigating agents on the psychosocial adjustment difficulties (i.e., depression, loneliness, anxiety) associated with cyber victimization. To address this gap in the literature, the present study investigated the role of different mitigating agents (i.e., parents, teachers, friends) in buffering against the psychosocial adjustment difficulties associated with cyber victimization among 483 Chinese (49% female) and 467 American (52% female) adolescents in the eighth grade (ages ranging from 13-15). Findings revealed that all adolescents experienced more mediation by their parents, with Chinese adolescents reporting more parental mediation when compared to American adolescents. Chinese adolescents also reported more teacher mediation, while American adolescents experienced more friend mediation. In addition, high levels of parental mediation made the relationship of cyber victimization to depression and anxiety more negative for both Chinese and American adolescents. The relationships of cyber victimization to depression and anxiety were moderated by teacher mediation for Chinese adolescents, whereas this pattern was not found for American adolescents. On the other hand, friend mediation moderated the relationship of cyber victimization to depression and anxiety for American adolescents, but not for Chinese adolescents. The results of this study are discussed in terms of cultural values and how such values alter the role of adults and friends in adolescents’ lives. © 2008 Cyberpsychology: Journal of Psychosocial Research on Cyberspace.","Anxiety; Cyber victimization; Depression; Loneliness; Mediation",,,,,,,,,,"Abelman, R., Fighting the war on indecency: Mediating TV, Internet, and videogame usage among achieving and underachieving gifted children (2006) Roeper Review: A Journal of Gifted Education, 29, pp. 100-112. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02783190709554393; Arrizabalaga-Crespo, C., Aierbe-Barandiaran, A., Medrano-Samaniego, C., Internet uses and parental mediation in adolescents with ADHD (2010) Revista Latina de Comunicación, 65, pp. 561-571; Bavelier, D., Green, C.S., Dye, M.W.G., Children, wired: For better and for worse (2010) Neuron, 67, pp. 692-701. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2010.08.035; Bauman, S., Toomey, R.B., Walker, J.L., Associations among bullying, cyberbullying, and suicide in high school students (2013) Journal of Adolescence, 36, pp. 341-350. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.adolescence.2012.12.001; Blackwell, C.K., Lauricelli, A.R., Wartella, E., Factors influencing digital technology use in early childhood education (2014) Computers & Education, 77, pp. 82-90. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.compedu.2014.04.013; Brighi, A., Guarini, A., Melotti, G., Galli, S., Genta, M.L., Predictors of victimisation across direct bullying, indirect bullying and cyberbullying (2012) Emotional & Behavioural Difficulties, 17, pp. 375-388. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13632752.2012.704684; Calvette, E., Orue, I., Estévez, A., Villardón, L., Padilla, P., Cyberbullying in adolescents: Modalities and aggressors' profile (2010) Computers in Human Behavior, 26, pp. 1128-1135. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chb.2010.03.017; Campbell, M., Speras, B., Slee, P., Butler, D., Kift, S., Victims' perceptions of traditional and cyberbullying and the psychosocial correlates of their victimization (2012) Emotional and Behavioural Difficulties, 17, pp. 389-401. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13632752.2012.704316; Chang, F., Chiu, C., Miao, N., Chen, P., Lee, C., Chiang, J., Pan, Y., The relationship between parental mediation and Internet addiction among adolescents, and the association with cyberbullying and depression (2014) Comprehensive Psychiatry, , http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.comppsych.2014.11.013, Advance online publication; Dehue, F., Bolman, C., Völlink, T., Cyberbullying: Youngsters' experiences and parental perception (2008) CyberPsychology & Behavior, 11, pp. 217-223. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1089/cpb.2007.0008; Dooley, J.J., Pyzalski, J., Cross, D., Cyberbullying versus face-to-face bullying: A theoretical and conceptual review (2009) Journal of Psychology, 217 (4), pp. 182-188. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1027/0044-3409.217.4.182; Dumont, M., Provost, M.A., Resilience in adolescents: Protective role of social support, coping strategies, self-esteem, and social activities on experience of stress and depression (1999) Journal of Youth & Adolescence, 28, pp. 343-363. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1021637011732; Edwards, C.P., Rosario de Guzman, M., Brown, J., Kumru, A., Children's social behaviors and peer interactions in diverse cultures (2006) Peer Relationships in Cultural Context, pp. 23-51. , X.

This article investigates children’s perspectives on parental interventions in regards their use of the internet, an aspect not covered in the parental mediation literature. Although children are generally positive about this mediation, here we explore cases where children consider it to be problematic through analysing the EU Kids Online qualitative research conducted in nine countries. The material shows how parental advice can sometimes be less articulated, justified, and expressed in a sensitive manner, and why it sometimes lacks credibility in children’s eyes. The article illustrates how maturing children can develop a sense of social expectations about independence, trust and personal social space. This can have a bearing on how they evaluate parental monitoring. Lastly, the article examines factors inhibiting children’s willingness to confide in parents about sensitive issues, because of potential parental responses, parenting styles, and a fear of losing parental trust that children have gained as they have grown older. © 2008 Cyberpsychology: Journal of Psychosocial Research on Cyberspace.","Children; EU kids online; Internet; New sociology of childhood; Parental mediation; Qualitative research",,,,,,,,,,"Austin, E., Exploring the effects of active parental mediation of television content (1993) Journal of Broadcasting & Electronic Media, 37, pp. 147-158. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/08838159309364212; Clark, L.S., Parental mediation theory for the digital age (2011) Communication Theory, 21, pp. 323-342. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1468-2885.2011.01391.x; Critcher, C., Making waves: Historical aspects of public debates about children and mass media (2008) The international handbook of children, media and culture, pp. 91-120. , K.

Young adult children also reported their perceptions of their parents’ technological knowledge for the various technologies. Comparisons of young adult self-reported technological knowledge and their parents’ own reports of technological knowledge revealed that young adults were perceived to be much more knowledgeable than their parents (by both the young adults and their parents) regardless of the technology medium. The largest differences between parents and their young adult children were associated with newer interactive technologies, with the largest gap between parent and young adult knowledge in the area of social networking. Perceived differences between parents and their young adult children were smaller among the technologies that have been in use longer (such as such as e-mail), and larger among the newer modes of interactive technology (e.g., video chat). © 2007-2015 Cyberpsychology: Journal of Psychosocial Research on Cyberspace.","Cell phones; Digital generation gap; Ecological theory; Email; Parents; Social networking; Video chat",,,,,,,,,,"Acock, A.C., Bengtson, V.L., Socialization and attribution processes: Actual versus perceived similarity among parents and youth (1980) Journal of Marriage and Family, 42, pp. 501-515. , http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/351895; Anderson, M., (2015) The demographics of device ownership, , http://www.pewinternet.org/2015/10/29/the-demographics-of-device-ownership/; Aquilino, W.S., Family relationships and support systems in emerging adulthood (2006) Emerging Adults in America, pp. 193-218. , In J.

Adolescents (N = 110) were surveyed about technology use, electronic device ownership, and the extent to which parents place restrictions on, and/or monitor, their cyber behavior. Adolescents were also asked about their experiences with parental regulation of cyber aggression, and these responses were compared to experiences with other forms of aggressive behavior (relational and overt). Perceptions of legitimacy of parental authority were also compared for online and offline aggression, and for acts typically considered to be within the personal domain. Adolescents believed their online behavior to be primarily unrestricted by parents. Parental regulation of cyber aggression was less prevalent than parental regulation of overt aggression, but greater than parental regulation of relational aggression. Adolescents believed regulation of cyber aggression to be more acceptable than regulation of relational aggression and personal domain behavior. © 2007-2015 Cyberpsychology: Journal of Psychosocial Research on Cyberspace.","Adolescent development; Cyber aggression; Parental monitoring of cyber behavior",,,,,,,,,,"Björkqvist, K., Lagerspetz, K.M.J., Kaukiainen, A., Do girls manipulate and boys fight?

Due to this ubiquity, researchers have sought to explore the positive and negative effects that can result from usage of social networking. This research has shown many effects on an individual's psychological well-being, with one of the most concerning being mixed results of how usage relates to depression. In this study, we further examine the relationship between usage and depression for social networking users. In addition, we posit that aspects of cognitive absorption, namely temporal dissonance, focused immersion, and heightened enjoyment, have a direct effect on the amount of usage. A survey of 251 social networking users reveals that temporal dissociation and heightened enjoyment are associated with increased usage, and usage was found to be associated with greater levels of depression. Further, prior research has shown a significant difference between genders in Internet usage and social networking. Therefore, we report our findings as an overall analysis and as a gender-based between-groups analysis. This analysis shows that more variance is explained for females than males in most relationships. Implications for research and society are discussed along with future research directions. © 2007-2015 Cyberpsychology: Journal of Psychosocial Research on Cyberspace.","Cognitive absorption; Depression; Gender differences; PLS; Social networking",,,,,,,,,,"Agarwal, R., Karahanna, E., Time flies when you’re having fun: Cognitive absorption and beliefs about information technology usage (2000) MIS Quarterly, 24, pp. 665-694. , http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/3250951; Andreassen, C.S., Online social network site addiction: A comprehensive review (2015) Current Addiction Reports, 2, pp. 175-184. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s40429-015-0056-9; Baron, R.S., Distraction-conflict theory: Progress and problems (1986) Advances in Experimental Social Psychology, 19, pp. 1-40. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0065-2601(08)60211-7; Bech, P., Rasmussen, N.-A., Olsen, L.R., Noerholm, V., Abildgaard, W., The sensitivity and specificity of the Major Depression Inventory, using the Present State Examination as the index of diagnostic validity (2001) Journal of Affective Disorders, 66, pp. 159-164. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0165-0327(00)00309-8; Broderick, R., 9 teenage suicides in the last year were linked to cyber-bullying on social network ask.Fm (2013) Buzzfeednews, , http://www.buzzfeed.com/ryanhatesthis/a-ninth-teenager-since-last-september-has-committed-suicide, September 11; Brooks, S., Does personal social media usage affect efficiency and well-being?

Recent studies have begun to use these data to rank order US states by per capita online pornography use and to identify the determinants of pornography use at the state level. The aim of this paper is to compare two previous methodologies for evaluating pornography use by state, as well as to measure online pornography use using multiple data sources. We find that state-level rankings from Pornhub.com, Google Trends, and the New Family Structures Survey are significantly correlated with each other. In contrast, we find that rankings based on data from a single large paid subscription pornography website has no significant correlation with rankings based on the other three data sources. Since so much of online pornography is accessed for free, research based solely on paid subscription data may yield misleading conclusions. © 2007-2015 Cyberpsychology: Journal of Psychosocial Research on Cyberspace.","Data; Internet use; Pornography; Representative",,,,,,,,,,"Bergen, R., Bogle, K., Exploring the connection between pornography and sexual violence (2000) Violence and Victims, 15, pp. 227-234; Buzzell, T., Demographic characteristics of persons using pornography in three technological contexts (2005) Sexuality & Culture, 9, pp. 28-48. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF02908761; Carneiro, H.A., Mylonakis, E., Google trends: A web‐based tool for real‐time surveillance of disease outbreaks (2009) Clinical Infectious Diseases, 49, pp. 1557-1564. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/630200; Choi, H., Varian, H., Predicting the present with Google trends (2012) Economic Record, 88 (1), pp. 2-9. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1475-4932.2012.00809.x; Cooper, A., Sexuality and the internet: Surfing into the new millennium (1998) Cyberpsychology & Behavior, 1, pp. 187-193. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1089/cpb.1998.1.187; Doran, K., Industry size, measurement, and social costs (2010) The Social Costs of Pornography: A Collection of Papers, , In M.

To date, no research has investigated the use of such groups by people with head and neck cancer (H&N). The aim of this study was to assess the types of social support, both sought and offered, within online support groups (OSGs) for head and neck cancer. Data was collected from 18 OSGs and two coding schemes; the Social Support Behaviour Code and the scheme of Coursaris & Liu (2009), were used to analyse the content of support-seeking and support-offering messages. The results suggested that the most frequently offered types of social support by group members were informational (43.4%) and emotional (32.4%), followed by esteem (15.6%) and network support (6.1%), whereas little tangible assistance was offered (2.4%). The content of support-seeking messages included group members sharing personal experience (31.5%), with the most frequent sought support being informational support (25.5%). The OSGs can be advantageous to people with H&N cancer, especially for those with appearance or speech problems to mitigate their embarrassment and facilitate interaction with others. The present findings suggest that such OSGs can be promising sources of H&N cancer-related informational and emotional support for the recipients, whether they are patients, family members or carers. © 2007-2015 Cyberpsychology: Journal of Psychosocial Research on Cyberspace.","Head cancer;

The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between social factors (i.e., sociability, social networking site use, Internet use via cell phones), risky online behaviors (i.e., lying about age, sexting, and harassing others), children’s emotional attachment to interactions within SNS, and parental involvement in children’s online social lives on the likelihood of being victims of cyberbullying as well as offline bullying. We found that increased sociability and parental involvement decreased the likelihood of being both cyberbullied and being bullied offline; daily SNS use, Internet use via cell phones, emotional attachment to interactions within SNS, and engaging in risky online behaviors increased the likelihood of being both cyberbullied and bullied offline. The findings suggest (1) cyberbullying is not categorically distinct from offline bullying; (2) future research is necessary to explore the qualitative impact of various risky online behaviors on both online and offline bullying; and (3) research is necessary to further understand the qualitative dimensions of parental involvement and emotional investment in online social life in decreasing online and offline bullying. © 2008 Cyberpsychology: Journal of Psychosocial Research on Cyberspace.","Adolescence; Bullying; Cyberbullying",,,,,,,,,,"Ackers, M.J., Cyberbullying: Through the eyes of children and young people (2012) Educational Psychology in Practice, 28, pp. 141-157. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02667363.2012.665356; Agger, B., (2013) Texting toward utopia: Kids, writing, and resistance, , Boulder, CO: Paradigm Publishing, Inc; Aoyama, I., Saxon, T.F., Fearon, D.D., Internalizing problems among cyberbullying victims and moderator effects of friendship quality (2011) Multicultural Education & Technology Journal, 5, pp. 92-105. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/17504971111142637; Baker, R.K., White, K.M., In their own words: Why teenagers don’t use social networking sites.

During a sensitive developmental phase, preteens are the largest users of media, consuming over seven-and-a-half hours a day, seven days a week, outside of school. A nationwide survey in the United States asked 315 youth (M = 12 years; range: 9 -15 years) about their media habits as well as their aspirations for the future. Participants’ answers about their future goals clustered around two factors, representing individualistic, self-focused and collectivistic, other-focused aspirations. Fame, image, money and status were items in the former; helping others in need, helping family, and living near family were items in the latter. Watching television and using a social networking site each predicted self-focused aspirations, above and beyond the influence of control variables of age and maternal education, while the two media activities together predicted a larger portion of the variance than either alone. Collectivistic, other-focused aspirations were associated with nontechnology activities, most of which had an important social component. The implication is that individualistic, self-focused aspirations are related to 21st century media, whereas more collectivistic, other-focused aspirations are related to nontechnology activities, particularly those with a social component. © 2008 Cyberpsychology: Journal of Psychosocial Research on Cyberspace.","Fame; Preteens; Self; Social media; Technology; Values",,,,,,,,,,"Idol, A., (2013) Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia, , http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Idol, Retrieved from; Arnett, J.J., Adolescent’s uses of media for self-socialization (1995) Journal of Youth and Adolescence, 24, pp. 519-532; Bandura, A., Social cognitive theory of mass communication (2001) Media Psychology, 3, pp. 265-299. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1207/S1532785XMEP0303_03; Bardi, A., Schwartz, S.H., Values and behavior: Strength and structure of relations (2003) Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, 29, p. 1207. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0146167203254602; Baumeister, R.F., The need to belong: Desire for interpersonal attachments as a fundamental human motivation (1995) Psychological Bulletin, 117, pp. 497-529; Bessiere, K., Kiesler, S., Kraut, R., Boneva, B., Effects of Internet use and social resources on changes in depression.

Participants included 205 married individuals who had been married for an average of 27 years (mean age = 51 years). Five specific boundaries were identified and tested using multiple sample structural equation modeling. Confirmatory factor analysis revealed two latent constructs for Internet boundaries: Openness and Fidelity. Trusting one’s partner, but not relationship satisfaction, was linked with behaviors that reflect sharing online social networking information, and decreased behaviors were associated with online flirting and relationships with former romantic partners. Trust was more strongly associated with men’s than women’s motivation to avoid flirtatious online interaction and communicating with former romantic partners online. These results indicate that the use of Internet boundaries is highly related to trust and also support the development theory of trust. © 2008 Cyberpsychology: Journal of Psychosocial Research on Cyberspace.","Boundaries; Couple relationships; Marriage; Social networking; Trust",,,,,,,,,,"Anderson, J.R., Van Ryzin, M.J., Doherty, W.J., Developmental trajectories of marital happiness in continuously married individuals: A group-based modeling approach (2010) Journal of Family Psychology, 24, pp. 587-596. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/a0020928; Arbuckle, J.L., (2009) Amos 18 user’s guide, , Chicago, IL: SPSS; Boon, S.D., Holmes, J.G., The dynamics of interpersonal trust: Resolving uncertainty in the face of risk (1991) Cooperation and prosocial behavior, pp. 190-211. , In R.

Online data were collected from four convenience samples of university students from Norway and Sweden, members of a queer youth organization, and readers of an erotic magazine. Because of cultural similarities and the comparable magnitude and patterns of the bivariate correlations among the samples on the study variables, they were pooled into a single sample (N = 1,274). The majority of men (81.1%) and a minority of women (18.1%) reported at least weekly use of Internet pornography on their personal computers, whereas using a mobile phone or tablet was less common. Most of the participants had sought mainstream pornographic content. Those with a stronger belief in pornographic realism were more likely to perceive the effect of pornography use positively. A hypothesized relationship between self-perceived positive effects of pornography use and a higher level of sexual self-esteem was found for men but not for women. This result was partially due to higher satisfaction with genital appearance among the men who mainly watched mainstream pornography. Genital appearance satisfaction was linked to higher sexual self-esteem for women, but it was not related to the self-perceived effect of pornography use. The results indicate that pornography may expand personal sexual scripts for both men and women, and may have a positive, although modest, influence on the sexual self-esteem of young male adults. © 2008 Cyberpsychology: Journal of Psychosocial Research on Cyberspace.","Genital appearance; Internet pornography; Sexual self-esteem",,,,,,,,,,"Blond, A., Impacts of exposure to images of ideal bodies on male body dissatisfaction: A review (2008) Body Image, 5, pp. 244-250. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bodyim.2008.02.003; Braun, V., Tricklebank, G., Clarke, V., It shouldn’t stick out from your bikini at the beach”: Meaning, gender, and the hairy/hairless body (2013) Psychology of Women Quarterly, 37, pp. 478-493. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0361684313492950; Busselle, R.W., Television exposure, perceived realism, and exemplar accessibility in the social judgment process (2001) Media Psychology, 3, pp. 43-67. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1207/S1532785XMEP0301_03; Byers, E.S., Shaughnessy, K., Attitudes toward online sexual activities (2014) Cyberpsychology: Journal of Psychosocial Research on Cyberspace, 8 (1). , http://dx.doi.org/10.5817/CP2014-1-10, article 10; Byrne, B.M., (2001) Structural equation modeling with AMOS: Basic concepts, applications, and programming, , Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum; Carvalho, J., Gomes, A.Q., Laja, P., Oliveira, C., Vilarinho, S., Janssen, E., Nobre, P., Gender differences in sexual arousal and affective responses to erotica: The effects of type of film and fantasy instructions (2013) Archives of Sexual Behavior, 42, pp. 1011-1019. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10508-013-0076-2; Comella, L., Fifty shades of erotic stimulus (2013) Feminist Media Studies, 13, pp. 563-566. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14680777.2013.786269; Daneback, K., Cooper, A., Månsson, S.-A., An Internet study of cybersex participants (2005) Archives of Sexual Behavior, 34, pp. 321-328. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10508-005-3120-z; Daneback, K., Månsson, S.-A., Ross, M.W., Technological advancements and Internet sexuality: Does private access to the Internet influence online sexual behavior?

We hypothesized that individuals high in empathy would supportively intervene (defend the victim) most frequently. College age participants (M = 20.34, SD = 1.26, range 18-27; N = 149), viewed a simulated Facebook conversation in which negative comments were directed towards another student and were provided open-ended opportunities to be involved in the Facebook conversation (i.e., “comment” to the other fictitious characters) and explain their reasoning for their behavior (“motivators”) at two time points in the conversation (Time 1 and Time 2). Using a deductive-inductive process, we categorized participants’ comments and motivators, the frequency of these responses, and their reasons for them. While the majority of participants (91%) asserted that cyber-bullying occurred in the conversation, most participants did not comment (Time 1: 69%, Time 2: 52%). Among those who commented, the most frequently cited motivators were either to defend the victim or mediate the situation. Consistent with our hypothesis, individuals who identified with the victim had higher empathy scores than those who identified with the bullies, although this was true only for the second part of the conversation (Time 2). Empathy scores did not differ by type of response at either time period.

Using a cross-sectional sample of young adults (age 18-28) recruited in the Czech Republic (N = 720), we compared these four groups (defined by their types of civic participation) regarding their socio-demographic profiles, trust (social, individual, and in the media), relationship to politics (political interest, exposure to politics in the media, and internal political efficacy), and political ideology (left-right orientation, concern with environmental issues, and support for immigrants’ rights). Results showed that people who prefer online participation adhere to conservative political ideologies than people with other types of participation. Their relationship to politics is as positive as in the case of people active in both environments. No substantial differences in trust and socio-demographics were found. © 2014, Masaryk University.

These debates have intensified with the emergence of social media, associated with a richer user experience and architecture of participation, openness, freedom and horizontality. In the context of this dualism among utopian and dystopian visions, this study aims to examine the uses of social media in social mobilisation and their transition to sustained spaces of social participation, i.e. social movements. The study includes three cases of recent social mobilisations: Occupy Wall Street (USA), Taksim Square protests (Turkey) and #YoSoy132 (Mexico). Discourse analysis was used to compare uses of social media in the narratives associated with those mobilisations. Three main themes were analysed: 1) references to democracy, in particular criticisms of representative democracy and proposals for alternatives; 2) comments on the role of social media in social mobilisation and its development; and 3) reflections on tensions between online and offline actions as part of collective action. The findings indicate that social media are mainly used for the emotional mobilisation of individuals and visibilisation during the period of major collective action and there is a two-step development from social media to collective mobilisation and from collective mobilisation to social movements. © 2014, Masaryk University.

The group that challenges local representatives and employs tactics of political satire, parody and culture jamming, evolved from a spontaneous one-off event to an ongoing political project and eventually became an institutionalized political actor. The case study, based on interviews with group members, content analysis of the project website, longitudinal observation of the group's activities and other additional material, enables us to research the limits and the potential of online tactics and the way online practices are intertwined with a more traditional repertoire of collective action. Building on debates about online political participation and the broadening concept of the political, we interpret the group's protest as a reaction to the crisis of institutionalized local politics and we discuss the actual role of new media in such a protest. The conclusion is that online protest and new media, despite their criticized action-less character, could enable a functional bridge to “real” politics but at the same time they do not play an exclusive role in successful protest politics and have to be interpreted within the context of a particular political action. © 2014, Masaryk University.

Developed by independent programmers and anti-Putin activists, these applications become a means of collective action and empowerment, redefining traditional repertoires of contention. They help citizens participate in public life by mapping, documenting and photographing different urban problems and hence enable citizen expertise and facilitate citizen control. The aim of this article is thus to understand how such small-scaled actions as pothole reporting or mapping street faults can become a means of empowerment and counter-democracy tools. The article is based on two years of field research and focuses on four cases of civic applications. Analyzing technical aspects, the genesis and design of these apps, the author provides an account of new repertoires of contention and new forms of citizenship created with the help of these tools. © 2014, Masaryk University.

This article advances this line of research by exploring how social network sites in general and Facebook in particular are fuelled by algorithms that affect and become entangled with social practices on these sites. The article is empirically grounded in an analysis of 66 self-reflexive diaries on Facebook use and studies algorithmic structures on Facebook by exploring how personalized social feeds affect the experienced relationship between self and others as well as the readiness to share information to a network of peers. In contrast to studies that position online platforms as strengthening participatory political action, this article argues that it is necessary to take into account how algorithmic structures affect interpersonal relationships and the experienced ability to engage in participatory practices. © 2014, Masaryk University.

It draws on the rapidly growing but still very much inconclusive empirical evidence concerning the use of new media and social network sites in particular for electoral mobilization and social activism, and their impact on more traditional forms of civic and political engagement. The theoretical framework of the paper is inspired by the competing perspectives on the role of social media for democratic participation and civic engagement, the mobilization vs. normalization thesis, as well as by the popular concepts of clicktivism or slacktivism (Morozov, 2009), denouncing online activism for allegedly not being complemented by offline actions and having little or no impact on real-life political processes. With the intention to empirically contribute to these discussions, this study uses data from a cross-sectional survey on a representative sample of the Czech adult population (N=1,653) which was conducted directly following the 2013 Parliamentary elections. The study was driven by the main research question: Is there a link between online political expression during the election campaign and traditional forms of political participation among Czech Facebook users? Furthermore, the analysis examined the relationship between online political participation and a declared political interest, electoral participation and political news consumption. The results obtained from an ordinal logistic regression analysis confirm the existence of a significant positive relationship between the respondents’ level of campaign engagement on Facebook and their political interest, political information seeking as well as traditional (mainly offline) participation activities, including voting. © 2014, Masaryk University.

But young people are also the most avid users of online media. It has therefore been argued that online media could be used to evoke their interest in politics, and thus contribute to the reinvigoration of democratic citizenship. Using a mixed qualitative methods approach, this article takes a closer look at 26 young Swedes’ experiences and understandings of social media, especially Twitter and Facebook, as used for political discussions. Compared to the average Swedish 17 to 18-year-olds, the participants are relatively interested in civic and political questions. By focusing on this segment, the article mirrors the experiences of an understudied group – young people who are interested in politics but not engaged. The participants were skeptical about social media as used in relation to politics, and expressed doubts about their suitability and usefulness. Four themes were identified, where three have to do with perceived risks: for conflict, misunderstandings and deceit. The participants also expressed the idea of online political activities as being less authentic than their offline equivalents. The idea that young people want and expect something that political organizations cannot live up to is one of the most dominant discourses that characterize the discussion on youth political participation today. However, while some properties of social media fit well into what young people have been found to prefer, for the participants, negative traits seem to outweigh the positive ones, thus discouraging them from participating. © 2014, Masaryk University.

The turmoil is, for the most part, contained within the framework of Kuwait’s indigenous democratic institutions but the lines that used to clearly delineate acceptable public norms of speech and action are becoming increasingly blurred. One factor contributing to the changes is the influence new media technologies have on Kuwaiti society, especially on youth. The paper focuses on the meanings and democratic potentials of the internet for youth in the context of the Gulf Arab country of Kuwait. Through an ethnographic approach and in-depth interviews, it explores how new media reconfigure complex social, cultural, and political relationships, potentially enabling different forms of public engagement in the process. © 2014, Masaryk University.

Except three respondents who considered themselves outliers in their community, all emphasized the need to upload ""nice"" pictures on social networking sites that do not give off any signs of sexual assertiveness.

This paper provides support for taking a developmental perspective to understand individuals behaviour' on social network sites in the forms of sharing information and the type of contacts. Adolescents, young adults, and adults' use of social network sites was investigated and compared to developmental expectations based on the needs for relationship development and identity development. Data were gathered by means of an online survey among 1008 respondents in the age range of 12 to 83-year-old. The results showed that adolescents have most contacts and were most likely to add unknown contacts, while young adults disclosed most information and adjusted privacy settings most often. These results match expectations based on adolescents' and young adults' greater need for relationship and identity development compared to adults. Implications of these findings in relation to future regulations of online behaviour are discussed.","Development; Information sharing; Online relationships; Self-disclosure; Self-presentation; Social network sites",,,,,,,,,,"Abril, P.S., Levin, A., Del Riego, A., Blurred boundaries: Social media privacy and the twenty-first-century employee (2012) American Business Law Journal, 49, pp. 63-124. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1744-1714.2011.01127.x; Acquisti, A., Gross, R., (2006) Imagined Communities: Awareness, Information Sharing, and Privacy On the Facebook, , http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/11957454_3, Paper presented at the 6th Workshop on Privacy Enhancing Technologies, Cambridge, UK, June; Altman, I., Taylor, D.A., (1973) Social Penetration: The Development of Interpersonal Relationships, , New York: Holt, Rinehart and Winston; Arnett, J.J., Emerging adulthood: A theory of development from the late teens through twenties (2000) American Psychologist, 55, pp. 469-480. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1037//0003-066x.55.5.469; Arnett, J.J., Emerging adulthood: Understanding the new way of coming of age (2006) Emerging Adults In America: Coming of Age In the 21st Century, pp. 3-19. , J.

Although just a mere entertainment and leisure activity for most gamers, its potentially negative and addictive outcomes were intensively studied and recently also acknowledged by the American Psychiatric Association (2013). MMOs are essentially a social activity, but empirical studies are equivocal in identifying whether and to what extent the social factors help develop the addictive gaming habits associated with these applications. The present study seeks to directly identify the role of social factors in online addictive gaming. Survey data from 667 MMO gamers were analysed. Together with an online game addiction scale, the investigated psychological factors included social motivation for gaming, online peer attachment and social self-efficacy. The results revealed that although social motivation was a predictor of addictive gaming, high social motivation was typical for intensive gamers regardless of their level of addiction. However, gamers at-risk of addiction scored lower in their social self-efficacy and interpersonal trust measured by peer attachment. This supports the poor-get-poorer hypothesis, that generally less socially skilled gamers face further problems online. However, social factors were only modestly associated to online addictive gaming which indicates higher relevance of other factors identified by literature, e.g. immersion and in-game rewards systems.","Online game addiction; Peer-attachment; Sociability; Social motivation; Social self-efficacy",,,,,,"Czech Science Foundation, GACR: P407/12/1831",,,,"(2013) Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, , American Psychiatric Association, 5th ed.).

However, little is known so far about how the discursive environment around opportunities and risks of the internet for children shapes the very context in which children's own perceptions are developed and their online experiences are situated. The aim of this contribution is threefold: (1) to understand how and to what extent children's perceptions of online risks incorporate media representations, parental worries and discourses circulating among peers; (2) to identify any age- or gender-specific patterns in the appropriation and conversion of media, parents' and peers' discourses; and (3) to identify whether there are cross-cultural variations in risk perceptions.","Children; Cross-cultural research; Online risks; Qualitative methods; Risk awareness",,,,,,,,,,"Barbovschi, M., Green, L., Vandoninck, S., Innovative approaches for investigating how children understand risk in new media (2013) Dealing With Methodological and Ethical Challenges, , http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/53060, London: EU Kids Online; Barbovschi, M., Marinescu, V., Velicu, A., Laszlo, E., Meeting new contacts online (2012) Children, Risk and Safety On the Internet, pp. 177-189. , S.

Recent findings indicate that within the web of cyberbullying culture a large group of individuals are both cyberbullies and victims. This group of cyberbully/victims has been shown to differ from pure cyberbullies or victims on various factors during adolescence; particularly self-esteem. However, little research to date has investigated cyberbullying behaviour in adults. The current study examined the prevalence of cyberbully typologies and their relationship with self-esteem within a convenience sample of 164 Australian young adults (72% being females; 17-25 years). Results found that the largest group identified were cyberbully/victims (62%), followed by individuals not involved (17%), cyberbullies (11%) and cybervictims (10%) respectively. The ratio of males and females in each of the four cyberbully typologies was similar. Contrary to previous research, all four cyberbully typologies reported similar levels of self-esteem. These findings suggest that research should examine cyberbullying behaviour across all age groups to determine if this is related to different factors in adolescence compared to adulthood. Limitations and future recommendations are discussed.","Adults; Cyberbully typologies; Cyberbullying; Cybervictimisation; Self-esteem",,,,,,,,,,"Ang, R., Goh, D., Cyberbullying among adolescents: The role of affective and cognitive empathy and gender (2010) Child Psychiatry and Human Development, 41, pp. 387-397. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10578-010-0176-3; Beran, T., Li, Q., Cyber-harassment: A study of a new method for an old behaviour (2005) Journal of Educational Computing Research, 32, pp. 265-277. , http://dx.doi.org/10.2190/8yqm-b04h-pg4d-bllh; Brighi, A., Melotti, G., Guarini, A., Genta, M., Ortega, R., Mora-Merchan, J., Thompson, F., Self-esteem and loneliness in relation to cyberbullying in three European countries (2012) Cyberbullying In the Global Playground: Research From International Perspectives, pp. 32-56. , Q.

It asks why there was such shock at finding mothers discussing sexual matters online, what types of discussion related to sex can actually be found on Mumsnet and why women use Mumsnet to discuss these matters. It suggests that the Internet in general offers a new place for women to discuss and discover their sexuality and that Mumsnet in particular offers an interactive and anonymous forum for women whose needs in this area are not met by the mainstream media. On Mumsnet women seek advice and support from others in similar situations, attempt to establish 'norms' relating to sexual behaviour, and supplement information given by health professionals.","Mothers; Mumsnet; Sex",,,,,,,,,,"Albright, J.M., Sex in America online: An exploration of sex, marital status, and sexual identity in Internet sex seeking and its impacts (2008) Journal of Sex Research, 45, pp. 175-186. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00224490801987481; Attwood, F., Fashion and passion: Marketing sex to women (2005) Sexualities, 8, pp. 392-406. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1363460705056617; Attwood, F., Intimate adventures sex blogs, sex 'blooks' and women's sexual narration (2009) European Journal of Cultural Studies, 12, pp. 5-20. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1367549408098702; Bogren, L.Y., Changes in sexuality in women and men during pregnancy (1991) Archives of Sexual Behaviour, 20, pp. 35-45. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF01543006; Boynton, P.M., Advice for sex advisors: A guide for 'agony aunts', relationship therapists and sex educators who want to work with the media.

I use Koskela's concept of 'empowering exhibitionism', Waskul's 'erotic looking glass', and Foucault's 'technologies of the self' to analyze self-shooting (taking photos of one-self). Constricting societal norms of sexuality, body shape and body practices influence how my participants (N=20, 10 female, 9 male, 1 transgender, ages 21 - 51, average age 34) live their embodied and sexual lives. Through self-shooting and by negotiating the community specific issues of control, power and the gaze, they are able to construct a new, empowered, embodied identity for themselves. I look at self-shooting and selfie-blogging as a practice of reclaiming control over one's embodied self AND over the body-aesthetic, thus appropriating what is and is not 'sexy'. The NSFW self-shooting community offers a safe space otherwise so hard to find within the body/sexuality-normative mainstream culture. This makes self-shooting a collective therapeutic activity. In their self-images participants construct themselves as 'beautiful', 'sexy', 'devious', 'more than just a mother and an employee' and as someone who 'likes their body instead of trying to not hate it'. The technologies of the self activated through diaristic blogging and selfie sharing, along with the empowerment from interactions with peers take bloggers on a path of sexual awakening and reintroduce them to their own bodies. © 2008 Cyberpsychology: Journal of Psychosocial Research on Cyberspace.","Body; Self-identity; Selfies; Sexuality; Visual narrative analysis",,,,,,,,,,"Albright, J.M., Sex in America online: An exploration of sex, marital status, and sexual identity in Internet sex seeking and its impacts (2008) Journal of Sex Research, 45, pp. 175-186. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00224490801987481; Attwood, F., (2010) Porn.com: Making Sense of Online Pornography, , New York: Peter Lang Publishing, Inc; Barker, M., Consent is a grey area?

The study includes 245 mid-adolescents (15 years of age; 55% girls) and 251 late-adolescents (18 years of age; 49% girls). Of the 496 teenagers, 54% had experiences of both online and offline sexual and romantic activities, while the remaining (46%) had only offline experiences. Teenagers' experiences with online sexual/romantic activities were associated with experiences of offline sexual/romantic activities. Multiple regressions showed that age (older) and risk behaviour contributed to higher engagement in offline sexual/romantic activities. In contrast, only higher risk behaviour contributed to higher engagement in online sexual/romantic activities for boys, but for girl several factors, such as age (younger), lower body esteem, higher riskand problem behaviour contributed to higher engagement in online sexual/romantic activities.

This paper summarizes existing data on sexting prevalence (17 studies), which reveal that sexting is much more common among adults than among youths, with increasing prevalence among adolescents as they grow older. The paper then looks at the current state of sexting research by reviewing all 50 sexting papers in the PsycINFO and PubMed databases published between 2009 and 2013 regarding their coverage of the risks and/or opportunities associated with sexting. Most of the papers (79%) address adolescent sexting as risky behavior and link it to sexual objectification and violence, to risky sexual behavior, and to negative consequences like bullying by peers and criminal prosecution under child pornography laws. In opposition to this deviance discourse, a normalcy discourse is appearing in the literature that interprets sexting as normal intimate communication within romantic and sexual relationships, both among adults and adolescents who are exploring and growing into adult relationships. Next, the paper analyzes the sexting risk prevention messages of 10 online educational campaigns. Such campaigns typically rely on scare scenarios, emphasize the risk of bullying and criminal prosecution, engage in female victim blaming, and recommend complete abstinence from sexting. The paper closes by questioning the abstinence approach in sexting education, and makes suggestions on how to move towards an evidence-based approach to sexting risk prevention that acknowledges both adolescents' vulnerability and sexual agency. © 2008 Cyberpsychology: Journal of Psychosocial Research on Cyberspace.","Bullying; Cell phone; Gender; Media education; Sexting; Sexually explicit user generated content",,,,,,,,,,"Agomuoh, F., Amanda Todd Suicide Doesn't End Cyber Torment For Ridiculed Teen (2012) International Business Times, , http://www.ibtimes.com/amanda-todd-suicide-doesnt-end-cyber-torment-ridiculed-teen-846827, October 15, Retrieved from; Agustina, J.R., Gómez-Durán, E.L., Sexting: Research criteria of a globalized social phenomenon (2012) Archives of Sexual Behavior, 41, pp. 1325-1328. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10508-012-0038-0; Ahern, N., Mechling, B., Sexting: Serious problems for youth (2013) Journal of Psychosocial Nursing and Mental Health Services, 51 (7), pp. 22-30. , http://dx.doi.org/10.3928/02793695-20130503-02; Albury, K., Crawford, K., Sexting, consent and young people's ethics: Beyond Megan's Story (2012) Journal of Media & Cultural Studies, 26, pp. 463-473. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10304312.2012.665840; Albury, K., Crawford, K., Byron, P., Mathews, B., (2013) Young People and Sexting In Australia, , http://jmrc.arts.unsw.edu.au/media/File/Young_People_And_Sexting_Final.pdf, Ethics, Representation, and the Law.

Data covering the years 2008 to 2010 and showing monthly, daily and hourly usage were gained through different log file analysis tools. Three different focus groups discussed the results. One focus group was made up by users of johns' forums, one group by female sex workers and another one by social workers. Data analysis revealed that johns frequent their web-forums mostly on late Monday afternoons, preferably between 5 p.m. and 6 p.m. According to the focus groups' discussions, this distinct time frame appears to be substantially based on the johns' intention to plan their activities in commercial sex. © 2008 Cyberpsychology: Journal of Psychosocial Research on Cyberspace.","Johns' internet forums; Mondays; Sex workers' clients; Temporal usage",,,,,,,,,,"Bernstein, E., (2007) Temporarily Yours: Intimacy, Authenticity, and The Commerce of Sex, , Chicago: University Press; Blevins, K.R., Holt, T.J., Examining the virtual subculture of Johns (2009) Journal of Contemporary Ethnography, 2009 (38), pp. 619-648. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0891241609342239; Campbell, R., Invisible men.

There are more steps in the Internet process compared to the IRL processes prior to face-to-face contact, as well as negotiations of risk reduction. Higher levels of risk behavior and specifically anal sex and rimming suggest that the Internet allows for pre-Face-To-Face negotiation of sexual scripts. © 2008 Cyberpsychology: Journal of Psychosocial Research on Cyberspace.","HIV risk; Internet; Internet contact; IRL contact; Men who have sex with men; Sexual partner; Sexual recruitment; STI risk",,,,,,,,,,"Agwu, A., Ellen, J., Rising rates of HIV infection among young U.S. men who have sex with men: Role of the Internet (2009) The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal, 28, pp. 633-634. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/inf.0b013e3181afcd22; Bauermeister, J., Leslie-Santana, M., Johns, M., Pingel, E., Eisenberg, A., Mr. right and mr. right now: Romantic and casual partner-seeking online among young men who have sex with men (2011) AIDS and Behavior, 15, pp. 261-272. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10461-010-9834-5; Bolding, G., Davis, M., Hart, G., Sherr, L., Elford, J., Where young MSM meet their first sexual partner: The role of the Internet (2007) AIDS and Behavior, 11, pp. 522-526. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10461-007-9224-9; Bolding, G., Davis, M., Sherr, L., Hart, G., Elford, J., Use of gay Internet sites and views about online health promotion among men who have sex with men (2004) AIDS Care-Psychological and Socio-Medical Aspects of AIDS/HIV, 16, pp. 993-1001. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09540120412331292453; Daneback, K., Månsson, S.A., Ross, M.W., Using the Internet to find offline sex partners (2007) CyberPsychology & Behavior, 10, pp. 100-107. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1089/cpb.2006.9986; Davis, M., Bolding, G., Sherr, L., Hart, G., Elford, J., How gay men negotiate risk through the Internet (2004) The XV International AIDS Conference, , Bangkok; Davis, M., Hart, G., Bolding, G., Sherr, L., Elford, J., E-dating, identity and HIV prevention: Theorizing sexualities, risk and network society (2006) Sociology of Health & Illness, 28, pp. 457-478. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-9566.2006.00501.x; Dawson, A.G., Ross, M.W., Henry, D., Freeman, A., Evidence of risk in ""barebacking"" men who have sex with men: Cases from the Internet (2005) Journal of Gay and Lesbian Psychotherapy, 9, pp. 73-83. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1300/j236v09n03_05; Davis, M., Hart, G., Bolding, G., Sherr, L., Elford, J., Sex and the Internet: Gay men, risk reduction and serostatus (2006) Culture Health & Sexuality, 8, pp. 161-174. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13691050500526126; Elford, J., Bolding, G., Davis, M., Sherr, L., Hart, G., Web-based behavioral surveillance among men who have sex with men: A comparison of online and offline samples in London, UK (2004) JAIDS-Journal of Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndromes, 35, pp. 421-426. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/00126334-200404010-00012; Elford, J., Bolding, G., Sherr, L., High-risk sexual behaviour increases among London gay men between 1998 and 2001: What is the role of HIV optimism?

There are few descriptions of how these contacts are established, but studies have indicated that young people under the age of 18 seldom engage in open prostitution online. This study aimed to examine what role the Internet and the use of smartphones play in young women selling sex online, focusing on the method of contact and the characteristics of the communication online between buyer and seller. The study included 15 young women between the ages of 15 and 25 (M=18.9) who had sold sex online before the age of 18. Thematic analysis was used to identify similarities and differences in the narratives. Two main themes were identified: (I) Internet use-Part of daily life, for good and bad, and Depending on mood. The young women described using the Internet on a daily basis. During periods of poorer psychological health they were more active on sites focusing on elf-destructiveness and sex. During these periods, they also sold sex more frequently. (II) Patterns of contacts-Innocent/curious, Dating, and Advertising. The narratives about communication prior to a sexual encounter detailed differences ranging from being lured to direct negotiations. The results indicate that there is a group of young women who sell sex online that is not in the open prostitution. Police and other authorities working with young women selling sex need to better understand the coded sexual communication behind some of these sexual encounters and how different communication strategies might affect the young women. © 2008 Cyberpsychology: Journal of Psychosocial Research on Cyberspace.","Internet; Online; Prostitution; Selling sex; Young women",,,,,,,,,,"Abelsson, J., Hulusjö, A., I sexualitetens gränstrakteren studie av ungdomar i Göteborg med omnejd som säljer och byter sexuella tjänster (2008) In Sexuality Borderlands-a Study of Adolescents In Gothenburg Vicinity That Sell and Exchange Sexual Favors, , http://goteborg.se/wps/wcm/connect/6ee666004218607ea8f5ab6f1cf2ff43/unga_som_saljer_sex.pdf?MOD=AJPERES&CACHEID=6ee666004218607ea8f5ab6f1cf2ff43, Göteborgs Stad: Social resursförvaltning.

This sexual revolution has resulted in both positive and negative aspects, enriching sexual functioning but also providing other risks for criminal, negative and harmful sexual conducts, or Online Sexual Problems (OSP). A deeper understanding of Internet sexuality is therefore important for practitioners who work in the psychological and sexological fields. Current studies on Internet sexuality span a broad spectrum with respect to data collection: interviews, questionnaires, observations, content analyses and Internet log file recordings have all been used. The aim of this paper is to offer the most complete overview of these instruments focusing on the strengths and weaknesses of different tools currently available to assess different dimensions of OSA, and to suggest a simple screener for OSP. A systematic search of published online sexual activities inventories was performed using PsychInfo and Pubmed (1993 to July 2013). Although many of them are adequate for their own purposes, our review revealed a lack of standardized, internationally (culturally) accepted tools that are epidemiologically validated in general populations and that can be used to investigate OSA and to assess OSP. The definitions of OSA and OSP continue to change and basic tools are essential to have a broader idea of the phenomenon and of the challenges and possibilities emerging from the double link between the Internet and sexuality. More accurate instruments are also necessary to help advanced clinical diagnosis and treatment for OSP. © 2008 Cyberpsychology: Journal of Psychosocial Research on Cyberspace.","Internet sexuality; Online sexual activities (OSA);

In Study 1, 81 male and 140 female undergraduate students completed a paper and pencil survey. In Study 2, an age and sexually diverse group of 137 men and 188 women recruited from the Internet completed an online survey. The results from the two studies were more similar than different. Attitudes toward the three types of activities were neutral to slightly positive on average. The three types of attitudes were significantly related but also distinct. The men's attitudes toward S-OSA and P-OSA were more positive than were the women's; the men and women did not differ in their attitudes toward N-OSA. Sexual minority individuals had more positive OSA attitudes overall. Individuals who were less traditional tended to have more positive attitudes. These results are discussed in terms of the growing acceptance of online sexuality. © 2008 Cyberpsychology: Journal of Psychosocial Research on Cyberspace.","Cybersex; Gender; Online sexual activity; Pornography; Sexual minority individuals",,,,,,,,,,"Ajzen, I., Fishbein, M., Attitude-behavior relations: A theoretical analysis and review of empirical research (1977) Psychological Bulletin, 84, pp. 888-918. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/0033-2909.84.5.888; Albarracin, D., Johnson, B.T., Fishbein, M., Muellerleile, P.A., Theories of reasoned action and planned behavior as models of condom use: A meta-analysis (2001) Psychological Bulletin, 127, pp. 142-161. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/0033-2909.127.1.142; Albright, J.M., Sex in America online: An exploration of sex, marital status, and sexual identity in Internet sex seeking and its impacts (2008) Journal of Sex Research, 45, pp. 175-186. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00224490801987481; Baumeister, R.F., Catanese, K.R., Vols, K.D., Is there a gender difference in strength of sex drive?

Data was used from a national survey conducted in 2011 among 4453 Dutch adolescents (51.2 % male), aged from 11 to 18 (M = 13.9, SD = 1.48). Results indicated that receiving sexual requests is quite common and that producing sexual images is relatively rare. From adolescents' perspective most of the incidences were non-problematic. Negative experiences were more likely to occur when adolescents interacted with people they did not know and when an intrinsic motivation for engaging in sexual interaction was missing. There was a strong relation between bothersome experiences and being cyberbullied. Adolescents with a higher level of online disinhibition and with low self-control were more likely to engage in both sexual communications as well as in sexting. Identifying which incident characteristics and characteristics of adolescents are related to problematic online sexual interactions is a prerequisite to design more personalized tools for vulnerable adolescents. © 2008 Cyberpsychology: Journal of Psychosocial Research on Cyberspace.","Adolescents; Characteristics; Risk factors; Sexting; Sexual interactions",,,,,,,,,,"Andriessen, D., Onstenk, J., Delnooz, P., Smeijsters, H., Peij, S., (2010) Gedragscode Praktijkgericht Onderzoek Voor Het Hbo; Gedragscode Voor Het Voorbereiden En Uitvoeren Van Praktijkgericht Onderzoek Binnen Het Hoger Beroepsonderwijs In Nederland [Dutch Code of Conduct For Research In Applied Sciences], , Delft: Elan Strategie & Creatie; Barak, A., Sexual harassment on the Internet (2005) Social Science Computer Review, 23, pp. 77-92. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0894439304271540; Bossler, A.M., Holt, T.J., The effect of self-control on victimization in the cyberworld (2010) Journal of Criminal Justice, 38, pp. 227-236. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcrimjus.2010.03.001; Cubbin, C., Santelli, J., Brindis, C.D., Braveman, P., Neighborhood context and sexual behaviors among adolescents: Findings from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (2005) Perspectives On Sexual and Reproductive Health, 37, pp. 125-134. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1363/3712505; Diener, E., Seligman, M.E.P., Beyond money: Toward an economy of well-being (2004) Psychological Science In the Public Interest, 5, pp. 1-31. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.0963-7214.2004.00501001.x; van den Eijnden, R.J.J.M., Vermulst, A., Online communicatie, compuslief internetgebruik en het psychosociale welbevinden van jongeren [Online communication, compulsive Internet use and psychosocial well-being among youth] (2006) Jaarboek IVCT En Samenleving 2006, pp. 25-44. , De Digitale Generatie Amsterdam: Boom; Grasmick, H.G., Tittle, C.R., Bursik, R.J., Arneklev, B.J., Testing the core empirical implications of Gottfredson and Hirschi's general theory of crime (1993) Journal of Research In Crime and Delinquency, 30, pp. 5-29. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0022427893030001002; Jones, L.M., Mitchell, K.J., Finkelhor, D., Trends in youth internet victimization: Findings from three youth internet safety surveys 2000-2010 (2012) Journal of Adolescent Health, 50, pp. 179-186. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jadohealth.2011.09.015; Kerstens, J., Stol, W.P., (2012) Jeugd En Cybersafety: Online Slachtofferen Daderschap Onder Nederlandse Jongeren [Youth & Cybersafety: Online Victimization and Perpetration Among Dutch Youth], , Den Haag: Boom Lemma uitgevers; Lenhart, A., (2009) Teens and Sexting: How and Why Minor Teens Are Sending Sexually Suggestive Or Nearly Nude Images Via Text Messaging, , Washington, D.C.: Pew Internet & American Life Project; Livingstone, S., Haddon, L., Görzig, A., Ólafsson, K., Risks and safety on the Internet: The perspective of European children (2011) Full Findings, , LSE London: EU Kids Online; Livingstone, S., Helsper, E., Taking risks when communicating on the Internet: The role of offline social-psychological factors in young people's vulnerability to online risks (2007) Information, Communication and Society, 10, pp. 619-643. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13691180701657998; Lounsbury, K., Mitchell, K.J., Finkelhor, D., (2011) The True Prevalence of Sexting, , Crimes Against Children Research Centre, University of New Hampshire, Durham, New Hampshire; Mitchell, K.J., Finkelhor, D., Jones, L.M., Wolak, J., Prevalence and characteristics of youth sexting: A national study (2012) Pediatrics, 129, pp. 13-20. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1542/peds.2011-1730; Mitchell, K.J., Finkelhor, D., Wolak, J., The exposure of youth to unwanted sexual material on the internet: A national survey of risk, impact, and prevention (2003) Youth & Society, 34, pp. 330-358. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0044118X02250123; Pardoen, J., Pijpers, R., Mijn kind online: Hoe begeleid je als ouder je kind op internet?

We used data from a national telephone survey of youth Internet users in the United States, aged 10 to 17 years old (N=1,560). One in ten adolescents (11%) reported a close relationship with a person met online. Results of a logistic regression indicated that the odds of forming close online relationships were about twice as high among youth with depressive symptoms, delinquent behavior, high Internet use, who sought out pornography online, had experienced unwanted online harassment, and had experienced an unwanted online sexual solicitation. Only 2% of youth reported such relationships with adults (18 and older) and many of these were with teens aged 18 or 19, less than 1% had an online relationship with someone over 21. Among youth with close online relationships, 3% sent or received sexual pictures and 34% met the person face-to-face. Of those who met the person, 4% of youth reported sexual contact. The great majority of youth were not afraid or uncomfortable during face-to-face meetings and it was common for parents to know of meetings. As youth continue to use online communication in diverse ways, it is important to better understand how youth are using the Internet to develop intimacy in their lives.","Adolescence; High-risk youth; Internet; Online relationships",,,,,,,,,,"(2011) Standard Definitions: Final Dispositions of Case Codes and Outcome Rates For Surveys, , American Association for Public Opinion Research (AAPOR), 7th ed, Retrieved from:, http://www.aapor.org/AM/Template.cfm?Section=Standard_Definitions2&Template=/CM/ContentDisplay.cfm&ContentID=3156; Berson, I.R., Grooming cybervictims: The psychological effects of online exploitation for youth (2003) Journal of School Violence, 2 (1), pp. 5-21. , doi: http://dx.doi.org/10.1300/J202v02n01_02; Bonetti, L., Campbell, M.A., Gilmore, L., The relationship of loneliness and social anxiety with children's and adolescent's online communication (2010) Cyberpsychology, Behavior, and Social Networking, 13, pp. 279-285. , doi: http://dx.doi.org/10.1089/cyber.2009.0215; Briere, J., (1996) Trauma Symptom Checklist For Children, , http://www.iprc.unc.edu/longscan/pages/measures/Age16/writeups/Age%2016%20Trauma%20Symptom%20Checklist.pdf, Retrieved from; Brick, J.M., Brick, P.D., Dipko, S., Presser, S., Tucker, C., Yuan, Y., Cell phone survey feasibility in the US: Sampling and calling cell numbers versus landline numbers (2007) Public Opinion Quarterly, 71, pp. 23-39; Davidson, J., Gottschalk, P., Characteristics of the Internet for criminal child sexual abuse by online groomers (2011) Criminal Justice Studies, 24, pp. 23-36. , doi: http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/1478601X.2011.544188; Eijinden, R., Meerkerk, G., Vermulst, A., Spijkerman, R., Engles, R., Online communication, compulsive Internet use, and psychosocial well-being among adolescents: A longitudinal study (2008) Developmental Psychology, 44, pp. 655-665; Gross, E., Logging on, bouncing back: An experimental investigation of online communication following social exclusion (2009) Developmental Psychology, 45, pp. 1787-1793. , doi: http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/a0016541; Hu, S.S., Balluz, L., Battaglia, M.P., Frankel, M.R., The impact of cell phones on public health surveillance (2010) Bulletin World Health Organization, 88, p. 799. , doi: http://dx.doi.org/10.2471/BLT.10.082669; Jones, L.M., Mitchell, K., Wolak, J., Finkelhor, D., Online harassment in context: Trends from three youth Internet safety surveys (2000, 2005, 2010) (2013) Psychology of Violence, 3, pp. 53-69; Jones, L.M., Mitchell, K.J., Walsh, W.A., Finkelhor, D., (2013) A Content Analysis of Youth Internet Safety Education Programs: Are Effective Prevention Strategies Being Used?, , Unpublished manuscript; Keeter, S., Kennedy, C., Dimock, M., Best, J., Craighill, P., Gauging the impact of growing nonresponse on estimates from a national RDD telephone survey (2006) Public Opinion Quarterly, 70, pp. 759-779. , doi: http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/poq/nfl035; Lee, S.J., Online communication and adolescent social ties: Who benefits more from Internet use?

Therefore, this study on 2,092 Czech children aged 12-18 examined which coping strategies were applied most often and to what extent victims of cyber aggression judged them to be effective. Effectiveness was measured in two ways: the extent to which the coping strategy buffered negative emotions, and the extent to which it stopped the cyber aggression. The subsample of 422 respondents (68% girls) who experienced online attacks was divided into two groups: victims of cyberbullying, who experienced long-term and severe victimization, and victims of less severe online harassment. The selection of strategies was compared between these groups and the most prevalent and effective strategies were identified. Overall, respondents in both groups used more than one strategy at once, but for victims of cyberbullying, most of the strategies proved less effective. Both groups showed similar patterns in their use of technical solutions, and both quite frequently sought social support. Also, both groups showed a low tendency for retaliation. Large differences were found in how respondents employed cognitive responses, such as trying to detach mentally from bullying incidents; these strategies were less frequent among victims of cyberbullying. In terms of effectiveness, victims of harassment considered technical solutions such as blocking contacts on social websites, seeking support, or ignoring the bully on purpose the most effective in stopping victimization, as opposed to victims of cyberbullying, who found them less effective, even though they used them as frequently as victims of online harassment. Differences in the effectiveness of coping strategies are discussed with regard to the intervention and prevention of cyberbullying.","Coping strategies; Cyberbullying; Effectiveness",,,,,,,,,,"Aricak, T., Siyahhan, S., Uzunhasanoglu, A., Saribeyoglu, S., Ciplak, S., Yilmaz, N., Memmedov, C., Cyberbullying among Turkish adolescents (2008) CyberPsychology & Behavior, 11, pp. 253-261; Beran, T., Li, Q., The relationship between cyberbullying and school bullying (2007) The Journal of Student Wellbeing, 1, pp. 16-33; Bonanno, R.A., Hymel, S., Cyber bullying and internalizing difficulties: Above and beyond the impact of traditional forms of bullying (2013) Journal of Youth and Adolescence, pp. 1-13; Cappadocia, M.C., Craig, W.M., Pepler, D., Cyberbullying prevalence, stability, and risk factors during adolescence (2013) Canadian Journal of School Psychology, 28, pp. 171-192; Dehue, F., Bolman, C., Völlink, T., Cyberbullying: Youngster's experiences and parental perception (2008) CyberPsychology & Behavior, 11, pp. 217-332; Dooley, J.J., Pyzalski, J., Cross, D., Cyberbullying versus face-to-face bullying (2009) Zeitschrift Für Psychologie/Journal of Psychology, 217, pp. 182-188; Dooley, J.J., Gradinger, P., Strohmeier, D., Cross, D., Spiel, C., Cyber-victimisation: The association between help-seeking behaviours and self-reported emotional symptoms in Australia and Austria (2010) Australian Journal of Guidance and Counselling, 20, pp. 194-209; Heirman, W., Walrave, M., Assessing concerns and issues about the mediation of technology in cyberbullying (2008) Cyberpsychology: Journal of Psychosocial Research On Cyberspace, 2 (2). , http://cyberpsychology.eu/view.php?cisloclanku=2008111401, article 1.

Following the integrative model of organisational trust, we hypothesise that respondents' level of trust in a specific commercial website is determined by three dimensions of trustworthiness: ability, integrity and benevolence. In order to test the proposed model, we conducted a survey among 1042 Flemish adolescents. Analyses indicate that perceived ability and integrity predicted adolescents' level of trust in the focal website. The respondents' trust in the website subsequently predicted their willingness to disclose. The influence of the discerned trustworthiness beliefs was fully mediated by the level of trust adolescents had in the specific commercial website. Adolescents' risk perception about disclosing information to this website also affected their willingness to disclose information. Finally, our analysis identified an individual's disposition to trust (i.e. trust propensity) as significantly predicting (1) the three trustworthiness beliefs and (2) the willingness to disclose the four discerned categories of personal information. Surprisingly no significant association was found between trust propensity and adolescents' trust in the specific commercial website.","Disclosure; Information privacy; Risk; Trust; Trustworthiness",,,,,,,,,,"Awad, N.F., Krishnan, M.S., The personalization privacy paradox: An empirical evaluation of information transparency and the willingness to we profiled online for personalization (2006) MIS Quarterly, 30, pp. 13-28; Baker, R.K., White, K.M., Predicting adolescents' use of social networking sites from an extended theory of planned behaviour perspective (2010) Computers In Human Behavior, 26, pp. 1591-1597; Bargh, J.A., McKenna, K.Y.A., The internet and social life (2004) Annu.

A sample of 143 young adults in Greece varying from 18 to 34 years of age completed four questionnaires on personality characteristics, depressive symptomatology, problematic SNS usage and socio-demographic factors. Problematic SNS usage is significantly and positively related to depression and Neuroticism, while negatively associated with Agreeableness. However, problematic use of SNS is not related to Conscientiousness, Openness to Experience and Extraversion, although the latter was found to be negatively associated with depression. Collectively, personality variables, depression and daily average usage account for about 33% of the variance in predicting problematic SNS usage. In contrast to previous research findings, age and gender are not found to be related to either problematic SNS usage or depressive symptomatology. However, place of residence is associated with Neuroticism and Problematic Use, with participants from rural areas exhibiting higher scores than participants from urban areas. Finally, Neuroticism and the average daily use of SNS have been proven to be good predictors of problematic SNS usage. Personality, depressive symptomatology and socio-demographic factors relate to the way Social Networking Sites are being used. Implications are discussed.","Depression; Internet; Personality characteristics; Problematic use; Social networking sites; Young adults",,,,,,,,,,"Top 500 Sites In Greece, , http://www.alexa.com/topsites/countries/GR, Alexa The Web Information Company (n.d.)., Retrieved from; Bahk, C.M., Sheil, A., Rohm, C.E.T., Lin, F., Digital media dependency, relational orientation and social networking among college students (2010) Communications of the IIMA, 10 (3), pp. 69-78; Baker, J.R., Moore, S.M., An opportunistic validation of studies on the psychosocial benefits of blogging (2011) Cyberpsychology, Behavior and Social Networking, 14, pp. 387-390; Butt, S., Phillips, J.G., Personality and self reported mobile phone use (2008) Computers In Human Behavior, 24, pp. 346-360; Caplan, S.E., Problematic Internet use and psychosocial well-being: Development of a theory-based cognitive-behavioral measurement instrument (2002) Computers In Human Behavior, 18, pp. 553-575; Caplan, S.E., Preference for online social interaction: A theory of problematic Internet use and psychosocial well-being (2003) Communication Research, 30, pp. 625-648; Christakis, D.A., Moreno, M.A., Trapped in the net: Will Internet addiction become a 21st-century epidemic?

In three experiments, we investigated their technology use and habitual multitasking and the learning effects of multitasking with online communication while reading expository text. In Experiment 1 (n = 35), participants engaged in a primary content learning task and a secondary communication task either sequentially or concurrently. Experiment 2 (n = 90) used a modified primary learning task involving reading comprehension and recall with a within-subjects design, wherein task difficulty (easy, difficult) and condition (sequential, concurrent) were within-subjects factors. Experiment 3 (n=40) used a moderately difficult task with condition (sequential, concurrent) as a within-subjects factor and a filler task for participants in the concurrent condition. Our results suggested that our college student participants were comfortable with technology and reported that on average they multitasked with four other activities while reading. Across the three experiments, we found no evidence that multitasking while reading disrupted content learning, reading comprehension, and recall. On the contrary, we found a beneficial effect of multitasking for the easy task (Experiment 2) and a trend toward a beneficial effect for the moderately difficult task (Experiment 3). We discuss possible explanations for why multitasking might enhance performance at lower levels of cognitive load and identify future directions for research.","Human computer interaction; Interruptions; Learning; Multitasking; Reading",,,,,,,,,,"Adler, R.F., Benbunan-Fich, R., Juggling on a high wire: Multitasking effects on performance (2012) International Journal of Human-Computer Studies, 70 (2), pp. 156-168; Agarwal, R., Karahanna, E., Time flies when you're having fun: Cognitive absorption and beliefs about information technology usage (2000) MIS Quarterly, 24 (4), p. 665. , doi:http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/3250951; Bjork, E.L., Bjork, R., (2009) Making Things Hard On Yourself, But In a Good Way: Creating Desirable Difficulties to Enhance Learning, , New York: Worth Publishers; Burak, L., Multitasking in the university classroom (2012) International Journal For the Scholarship of Teaching and Learning, 6 (2), pp. 1-12; Chen, H., Wigand, R.T., Nilan, M., Exploring Web users' optimal flow experiences (2000) Information Technology People, 13 (4), pp. 263-281. , doi:http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/09593840010359473; Csikszentmihalyi, M., Flow: The Psychology of Optimal Experience (Book) (1990) Library Journal, 115 (5), p. 105. , http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=aph&AN=9005070595&site=ehost-live, Retrieved from; Czerwinski, M., Horvitz, E., Wilhite, S., A diary study of task switching and interruptions (2004) Baseline, 6 (1), pp. 175-182; Ellison, N.B., Steinfield, C., Lampe, C., The benefits of Facebook ""friends:"" Social capital and college students' use of online social network sites (2007) Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication, 12 (4), pp. 1143-1168. , doi:http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1083-6101.2007.00367.x; Fox, A.B., Rosen, J., Crawford, M., Distractions, distractions: Does instant messaging affect college students' performance on a concurrent reading comprehension task?

However, adolescents and emerging adults use digital communication primarily to communicate with existing friends rather than to make new connections. We compared feelings of emotional connectedness as they occurred in person and through digital communication among pairs of close friends in emerging adulthood. Fifty-eight young women, recruited in pairs of close friends, engaged in four conversations each: in-person, video chat, audio chat, and instant messaging (IM). Bonding in each condition was measured through both self-report and affiliation cues (i.e., nonverbal behaviors associated with the emotional experience of bonding). Participants reported feeling connected in all conditions. However, bonding, as measured by both self-report and affiliation cues, differed significantly across conditions, with the greatest bonding during in-person interaction, followed by video chat, audio chat, and IM in that order. Compared with other participants, those who used video chat more frequently reported greater bonding with friends through video chat in our study. Compared with other participants, those who spoke on the phone more frequently with their participating friend reported greater bonding during audio chat. Use of textual affiliation cues like emoticons, typed laughter, and excessive letter capitalization during IM related to increased bonding experience during IM. Nonetheless, a significantly lower level of bonding was experienced in IM compared with in-person communication. Because adolescent and emerging adults' digital communication is primarily text-based, this finding has significant real-world implications.","Bonding; Digital communication; Emerging adulthood; Friendship",,,,,,,,,,"Antheunis, M.L., Schouten, A.P., Valkenburg, P.M., Peter, J., Interactive uncertainty reduction strategies and verbal affection in computer-mediated communication (2012) Communication Research, 39, pp. 757-780; Antheunis, M.L., Valkenburg, P.M., Peter, J., The quality of online, offline, and mixed-mode friendships among users of a social networking site (2012) Cyberpsychology: Journal of Psychosocial Research On Cyberspace, 6 (3). , http://www.cyberpsychology.eu/view.php?cisloclanku=2012120304, article 1.

E-mentoring has increased in popularity as a means of reducing some of the challenges associated with being mentored by men. Numerous studies conducted on formal mentoring programs have concluded that there are serious implications to consider in traditional cross-gendered mentoring schemes. A sample of six mentees and seven mentors (three female and four male) were interviewed after a year-long e-mentoring program was created to promote women to leadership roles within the Information Technology (IT) sector. The paper explores whether gender-biases encountered in traditional mentoring schemes are transcended when using an e-mentoring platform. Results from this qualitative study suggest that mentor gender still impacts the mentoring relationship even in a virtual environment. The study's findings indicated male mentors tended to be more methodological in solving problems with their mentees, unlike female mentors who took a more indirect approach. Further, female mentors improved their mentee's confidence through encouragement and relating to their mentee on a more personal level, a practice often avoided by their male counterparts. A summary of these findings is provided below, followed by a detailed discussion of the results and a section offering possible future research avenues to explore.",,,,,,,,,,,"Allen, T.D., Day, R., Lentz, E., The role of interpersonal comfort in mentoring relationships (2005) Journal of Career Development, 31, pp. 155-169; Allen, T.D., Eby, L.T., Poteet, M.L., Lentz, E., Lima, L., Career benefits associated with mentoring for protégés: A meta-analysis (2004) Journal of Applied Psychology, 89, pp. 127-136; An, S., Lipscomb, R., Instant mentoring: Sharing wisdom and getting advice online with eMentoring (2010) Journal of the American Dietetic Association, 110, pp. 1148-1155; Bierema, L., Merriam, S., E-Mentoring: Using computer mediated communication to enhance the mentoring process (2002) Innovative Higher Education, 26, pp. 211-227; Bowen, D.D., Were men meant to mentor women?

A comprehensive literature review focusing on studies that have asked parents about their Internet use was conducted to include research published through December 2011. This yielded 27 studies. Articles were summarized and then organized by content. Three main themes emerged: what parents are doing online, social support online, and the digital divide. This literature review revealed that parents go online to search for parenting information and social support and generally report satisfaction with the resources they find on the Internet. Parents still express hesitation in trusting various online resources, though, and desire greater education in Internet searching and deciphering the credibility of online information. In addition, this review also exposes gaps in current research, provides direction for future research, and has implications for how to effectively reach parents using the Internet.","Education; Internet use; Literature review; Parenting",,,,,,,,,,"Allen, K., Rainie, L., Parents online (2002) Pew Internet and American Life Project, , http://www.pewinternet.org/~/media/Files/Reports/2002/PIP_Parents_Report.pdf.pdf, Retrieved from; Arksey, H., O'Malley, L., Scoping studies: Towards a methodological framework (2003) International Journal of Social Research Methodology, 8, pp. 19-32; Berkule-Silberman, S.B., Dreyer, B.P., Huberman, H.S., Klass, P.E., Mendelsohn, A.L., Sources of parenting information in low SES mothers (2010) Clinical Pediatrics, 49, pp. 560-568; Bernhardt, J.M., Felter, E.M., Online pediatric seeking among mothers of young children: Results from a qualitative study using focus groups (2004) Journal of Medical Internet Research, 6, pp. e7; Bouche, G., Migeot, V., Parental use of the Internet to seek health information and primary care utilization for their child: A cross-sectional study (2008) BMC Public Health, 8, p. 300; Brady, E., Guerin, S., Not the romantic, all happy, coochy coo experience: A qualitative analysis of interactions on an Irish parenting web site (2010) Family Relations, 59, pp. 14-27; Chan, A.H.N., 'Life in happy land': Using virtual space and doing motherhood in Hong Kong (2008) Gender, Place and Culture-A Journal of Feminist Geography, 15, pp. 169-188; Cohall, A.T., Cohall, R., Dye, B., Dini, S., Vaughan, R.D., Parents of urban adolescents in Harlem, New York, and the Internet: A cross-sectional survey on preferred resources for health information (2004) Journal of Medical Internet Research, 6, pp. e43; Daneback, K., Plantin, L., Research on parenthood and the Internet: Themes and trends (2008) Cyberpsychology: Journal of Psychosocial Research On Cyberspace, 2 (2). , http://cyberpsychology.eu/view.php?cisloclanku=2008110701&article=2, Article 2 Retrieved from; Dimaggio, P., Hargittai, E., Celeste, C., Shafer, S., From unequal access to differentiated use: A literature review and agenda for research on digital inequality (2004) Social Inequality, pp. 355-400. , In K.

An experimental study was conducted utilising screen capture, diaries, and a final interview. An innovative aspect of the experiment was the use of emoticons in a social network visualisation tool to represent emotional status. The contribution of the study is two-fold. We extend previous research with a more nuanced understanding of privacy concerns and behaviours in SNS in the context of different social ties. We also demonstrate an innovative research design using a social network visualization tool, and show the value of SNS visualization for researchers and social network users.","Experiment; Privacy; Social capital; Social network sites; Visualization",,,,,,,,,,"Boyd, D., (2003) Reflections On Friendster, Trust and Intimacy, , Paper presented at the Intimate (Ubiquitous) Computing Workshop, Ubicomp, Seattle, Washington; Boyd, D., Social network sites: Public, private, or what?

Additionally, country differences in cyberbullying on-the-go are explored. Analyses were carried out employing a random stratified sample of 25,142 children aged 9-16 from 25 European countries. A multilevel stepwise logistic regression with cyberbullying mode (online and mobile phone vs. online only) as the dependent variable showed that among online bully victims being cyberbullied on-the-go was less likely in Bulgaria and Denmark and more likely in Sweden when compared to the odds across all countries. Moreover, being cyberbullied on-the-go was associated with being older, female and using the internet on-the-go (step 1), higher sensation seeking, psychological difficulties and being more upset by the experience (step 2) as well as a higher likelihood of being bullied via social networking sites (SNS) and instant messages (IM) but not the range of cyberbullying types experienced (step 3). In this last step of the analysis being upset by the experience as well as psychological difficulties ceased to be related to the mode of cyberbullying suggesting that cyberbullying experiences on SNS and IM are potential mechanisms by which cyberbullying on-the-go is experienced as more distressing.","Adolescence; Aggression; Bullying; Cyberbullying; Social networking",,,,,,,,,,"Berson, I.R., Berson, M.J., Ferron, J.M., (2007) Emerging risks of violence in the digital age: Lessons for educators from an online study of adolescent girls in the United States, , http://www.ncsu.edu/meridian/sum2002/cyberviolence/cyberviolence.pdf, Retrieved From; Blair, J., New breed of bullies torment peers on the Internet (2003) Education Week, 22 (1), pp. 6-7; Browne, W.J., Subramanian, S.V., Jones, K., Goldstein, H., Variance partitioning in multilevel logistic models that exhibit overdispersion (2005) Journal of the Royal Statistical Society: Series a (Statistics In Society), 168, pp. 599-613; Campbell, M.A., Cyber bullying: An old problem in a new guise?

Three types of response were examined: telling someone about the incident and ending the unwanted situation by active or passive coping. Responses to the following unwanted Internet experiences were analysed: Sexual solicitation, online harassment and unwanted exposure to pornography. The study was based on data from the Third Youth Internet Safety Survey (YISS-3), a telephone survey with a nationally representative U.S. sample of 1,560 Internet users, ages 10 to 17, and their caretakers. Youth's responses to unwanted Internet experiences differ depending on the type of unwanted experiences, whether they are distressed or have other negative reactions caused by the incident and - to some degree - other youth characteristics and incident characteristics. For example, not all youth who are distressed tell someone and not all youth who tell someone are distressed. Also, the reasons for telling may differ depending on whom they tell, and youth tell somebody less often about their victimization if they also are online perpetrators, but of different types of unwanted Internet experiences. Internet safety information for parents and parents' active mediation of Internet safety does not seem to result in youth telling more often about unwanted Internet experiences.","Coping; Disclosure; Internet; Online harassment; Youth",,,,,,,,,,"(2011) Standard Definitions: Final Dispositions of Case Codes and Outcome Rates For Surveys, , http://www.aapor.org/AM/Template.cfm?Section=Standard_Definitions2&Template=/CM/ContentDisplay.cfm&ContentID=3156, American Association for Public Opinion Research (AAPOR) (7th Ed.), Retrieved from:; Brick, J.M., Brick, P.D., Dipko, S., Presser, S., Tucker, C., Yuan, Y., Cell phone survey feasibility in the US: Sampling and calling cell numbers versus landline numbers (2007) Public Opinion Quarterly, 71, pp. 23-39; (2012) Internet Safety Tips For Elementary School Kids, , http://www.commonsensemedia.org/advice-for-parents/internet-safety-tips-elementary-school-kids, Common Sense Media, Retrieved from:; Curtin, R., Presser, S., Singer, E., Changes in telephone survey nonresponse over the past quarter century (2005) Public Opinion Quarterly, 69, pp. 87-98; Dürager, A., Livingstone, S., (2012) How Can Parents Support Children's Internet Safety?

A mixed method approach was employed with girls aged 12-15 years old in Northern Ireland which captured 494 questionnaire responses and eight online interviews conducted using instant messenger. Findings show that girls of this age group are high IM and SNS users. These forms of communication may be used to impersonate others, convey hurtful or malicious comments or share private or embarrassing information with online audiences. The data indicates that these online forms of bullying may be facilitated within friendship groups in an offline context in order for them to have access to such information and access to the appropriate audience. Furthermore, the research indicates that older girls experience and participate in cyberbullying more than younger girls. This article positions these findings within the conceptual framework of Goffman's understanding of social interactions as a performance and proposes a model which applies this framework of performance to the phenomenon of cyberbullying.","Bullying as performance; Cyberbullying; Instant messenger; Social networking sites",,,,,,,,,,"Besag, V.E., (2006) Understanding Girls' Friendships, Fights, and Feuds: A Practical Approach to Girls' Bullying, , Maidenhead, England; New York: Open University Press; Boyd, D.M., Social networking sites: Public, private or what?

Semi-structured interviews (N = 15) were carried out to explore the various privacy strategies teens implement in order to manage their extended audience. The findings indicate that the majority of the teens in the sample had misperceptions about the size of their online audience. Furthermore, many of them seldom thoroughly thought about possible privacy issues when communicating on mediated publics. Although several of our interviewees confessed that they only kept the members of the ""ideal audience"", i.e. close friends and schoolmates, in mind while publishing posts, others claimed to be ""performing"" somewhat differently in front of extended audience. Our results therefore challenge widespread assumptions that youth do not care about privacy and are not engaged in navigating privacy, as three main privacy strategies - strategic information sharing, self-censorship and social steganography - were implemented by the young interviewees.","Imagined audiences; Privacy strategies; Social media; Social steganography; Teens",,,,,,,,,,"Acquisti, A., Gross, R., (2006) Imagined Communities: Awareness, Information Sharing, and Privacy On the Facebook, , http://petworkshop.org/2006/preproc/preproc_03.pdf, 6th Workshop on Privacy Enhancing Technologies, Robinson College, Cambridge University, UK.

The analysis compares the perceptions of Portuguese children (9-16) based on an open-ended question about online risk from the EU Kids Online survey and two open-ended questions about online safety from a survey of disadvantaged children. Theoretically, the article combines constructionist perspectives on risk with the framework and matrix used in EU Kids Online project. Methodological tools from cognitive sciences and from critical discourse analysis were used to explore children's answers. These theories and methods contributed to capture children's own discourses on online risk and safety, which are complex, often ambivalent and affected by hegemonic public discourses expressing media panics and fears. The analysis made visible how different wordings of questions may lead to different answers and to distinctive children's positions, from apparently excluded of the risk situations to keen advisors of their peers on online safety.","Children and the internet; Critical discourse analysis; EU Kids Online; Online risk; Qualitative methods",,,,,,,,,,"Beck, U., Risk Society (1986) Towards a New Modernity, , London: Sage; Bernstein, B., (1974) Class, Codes and Control, , London: Routledge; Davison, W.P., The third-person effect in communication (1983) The Public Opinion Quarterly, 47, pp. 1-15; Fairclough, N., Analysing discourse (2003) Textual Analysis For Social Research, , London: Routledge; Fowler, R., (1991) Language In the News, , London: Routledge; Haddon, L., Ponte, C., A pan-European study on children's online experiences: Contributions from cognitive testing.

Technological developments associated with capitalist society are entwined with the risk discourse, but little account has previously been taken of children's views in social analyses of risk. Based on the accounts of thirty young people in the UK aged between 11 - 17 this study adopts a social constructivist perspective to offer a theoretical framework which explores how children themselves actually use mobile phone technologies and understand and manage risk in their everyday lives. Implications of risk and mobile phones are reflected in current media discourse and contemporary public discussions. This research explores the relationship between young people's use of mobile phone technology and the wider theoretical debates about risk, technology and subjectivity. It provides insight into the social aspects of risk and mobile phones in contemporary childhoods.

It also looks at their relations to different audiences, privacy, and the school community as a central social environment in young people's everyday life. The research was conducted as an ethnographic study in one public secondary school in Finland during the academic year 2009-2010. The ethnography is preceded by a quantitative survey on media use among school students (N = 305). EU Kids Online research data (N = 1012) regarding Finland was used in the analysis of young people's internet use as well. The internet offers different possibilities for young people to publish, share, and participate online. Although the study shows that the majority of young people are not especially eager to share their creative productions on the internet, some of the teens studied had a strong interest in creative media production and online activities. The case study shows that young people's creative online activities vary from individual activities, such as school-community-based communal activities, to collaborative activities with peers. In order to control their privacy online, young people try to manage their self-presentations, their audiences, and their spaces where they share their productions. It also seems that active and creative internet users get more support for internet safety from their peers and teachers.","Creative online practices; Privacy; Publicity; School; Youth",,,,,,,,,,"Acquisti, A., Gross, R., (2006) Imagined Communities: Awareness, Information Sharing, and Privacy On the Facebook, , http://petworkshop.org/2006/preproc/preproc_03.pdf, 6th Workshop on Privacy Enhancing Technologies, Robinson College, Cambridge University, UK.

To illustrate this method we provide details for the implementation of a study on social distances between Black, White, and Asian participants in Second Life. Participants' avatars were fitted with a virtual object containing a computer script that recorded their coordinates on the Second Life grid at one-second intervals. Participants interacted at a social event in a controlled environment in Second Life for 15 minutes. A computer algorithm (developed for this study in the statistical analysis program, R) was used to calculate each participant's average social distance from one another across the 15-minute event. Average social distance scores were then aggregated into social distance towards racial groups as a whole (i.e., each participants' social distance towards Blacks, Whites, and Asians). This paper provides details for researchers interested in adopting or modifying our Virtual World method for interpersonal behavioral data collection and interpretation. Specifically we focus on the development of a controlled Second Life environment, the adaptation of a Second Life computer script (adapted from Yee & Bailenson, 2008), the computer algorithm for calculating social distances, and our methods for recruiting and conducting study trials.","Interpersonal behavioral data; Second life; Social distance; Virtual world",,,,,,,,,,"Bailenson, J.N., Blascovich, J., Guadagno, R.E., Self-representations in immersive virtual environments (2008) Journal of Applied Social Psychology, 38, pp. 2673-2690; Blascovich, J., Loomis, J., Beall, A.C., Swinth, K.R., Hoyt, C.L., Bailenson, J.N., Immersive virtual environment technology: Just another methodological tool for social psychology?

The aim of the following two studies was to investigate two markers of behavioural addiction, cue-reactivity and impulsivity, in a sample of MMORPG users. Study 1 employed a rapid serial visual presentation paradigm that required identification and recall of MMORPG or neutral words. Eighteen MMORPG users identified as addicted using the Addiction-Engagement Questionnaire had significantly better recall of MMORPG words compared to neutral words whereas 19 highly engaged and 20 non-MMORPG users showed no differences. These findings are consistent with previous behavioural addiction research. Study 2 explored evidence for trait impulsivity and disinhibition using a continuous performance task and the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale-11. Twenty-three regular MMORPG users and 21 non-gamers did not differ in levels of impulsivity but MMORPG users exhibited significantly lower disinhibition. Significant relationships were found between addiction and both overall impulsivity and the non-planning factor of impulsivity, but not between addiction and the attentional or motor factors of impulsivity. Implications for research conceptualising excessive MMORPG use as a behavioural addiction and methods of identification are discussed. © 2008 Cyberpsychology.","Addiction; Attentional bias; High engagement; Impulsivity; MMORPG",,,,,,,,,,"(2000) Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, , American Psychiatric Association, (4th ed., text rev.).

The second aim was to investigate the relative contribution of proximity, perceived similarity, and social attraction to the quality of each of the three types of friendships. We surveyed 2,188 members of a Dutch social networking site. Results showed that the quality of all three types of friendships increased over time. The differences in quality between online and offline friendships remained significant over time, but those between mixed-mode and offline friendships disappeared. Proximity did not affect the quality of any of the three types of friendships. Perceived similarity was the most important predictor of online friendships, whereas social attraction was the most important predictor of mixed-mode and offline friendships. Our results are discussed in the light of both interpersonal and computer-mediated communication theories.","Proximity; Quality of friendship; Similarity; Social attraction; Social networking sites",,,,,,,,,,"Aboud, F.E., Mendelson, M.J., Determinants of friendship selection and quality: Developmental perspectives (1996) The Company They Keep: Friendship In Childhood and Adolescence, pp. 87-112. , W.

An open question concerns how personality is expressed on the Internet. Although some authors postulate a structural change of personality on the Internet, the precondition of cross-situational consistency rather speaks for just a different, situation-dependent expression of personality on the Internet. This study provides an initial empirical approach to the question of whether the five factor personality traits - exemplary for the whole personality of a person - express differently on the computer and on the Internet. Therefore, the five factors of 122 student participants were measured by the NEO-FFI. In a second step, the same subjects completed a modified version of the NEO-FFI, in which all items refer to computer-mediated communication. Results indicate that with regard to four of the five factors, the absolute influence of personality on behavior and experience decreases in favor of situational impact. In the case of neuroticism, a different effect occurred. On the computer and the Internet participants report higher emotional stability than in the offline world.","Big five; Computer-mediated communication; Cross-situational consistency; Five factors; Person-situation controversy",,,,,,,,,,"Amichai-Hamburger, Y., Kaplan, H., Dorpatcheon, N., Click to the past: The impact of extroversion by users of nostalgic websites on the use of Internet social services (2008) Computers In Human Behavior, 24, pp. 1907-1912; Amichai-Hamburger, Y., Vinitzky, G.B., Social network use and personality (2010) Computers In Human Behavior, 26, pp. 1289-1295; Amichai-Hamburger, Y., Wainapel, G., Fox, S., On the Internet no one knows I'm an introvert: Extroversion, neuroticism, and Internet interaction (2002) CyberPsychology & Behavior, 5, pp. 125-128; Blumer, T., Renneberg, B., Easy living in a virtual world?

However, avatar creation research often directly asks participants about their creation motivations or primes a specific social context. Such direct methodologies potentially lead to biases which may give a distorted picture of how ideal characteristics are reflected in avatars. Our research used a less explicit measure to test for the expression of ideal body image during avatar creation. Female participants created two avatars in the virtual world of Second Life. For the first, participants were instructed to design an avatar that looked like themselves. For the second, participants were given no design restrictions and could design any avatar they wanted to. This first avatar acted as a baseline, to identify which attributes were the focus of change in the second. Avatar creation order was counterbalanced across participants. When given no design restrictions, participants who showed a desire to be thinner created avatars which had a lower body mass. This desire was measured after avatar creation using a standard body image scale. The generalizability of the results is discussed in the context of suggestions for future research utilising this paradigm.","Avatars; Body image; Impression management; Self-presentation; Virtual reality",,,,,,,,,,"Back, M.D., Stopfer, J.M., Vazire, S., Gaddis, S., Schmukle, S.C., Egloff, B., Gosling, S.D., Facebook profiles reflect actual personality not self-idealization (2010) Psychological Science, 21, pp. 372-374; Bessière, K., Seay, A.F., Kiesler, S., The ideal elf: Identity exploration in World of Warcraft (2007) CyberPsychology & Behavior, 10, pp. 530-535; Buss, D.M., (1994) The Evolution of Desire: Strategies of Human Mating, , New York: Basic Books; Caspi, A., Gorsky, P., Online deception: Prevalence, motivation and emotion (2006) CyberPsychology & Behavior, 9, pp. 54-59; Cornwell, B., Lundgren, D.C., Love on the Internet: Involvement and misrepresentation in romantic relationships in cyberspace vs. realspace (2001) Computers In Human Behavior, 17, pp. 197-211; Drewnowski, A., Yee, D.K., Men and body image: Are males satisfied with their body weight?

Samples were formed in pre-school childcare institutions, which in Estonia is for children aged 1,5 to 7. Research shows that other members of the pre-school group influence children's preferences in their use of new media. Parents consider the shaping of their children's preferences to be less connected to the children's relations with their peers. Teachers, on the other hand, ascribe the children's preferences to different aspects of the influence that their peers, siblings and parents can have on them. © 2008 Cyberpsychology.","New media preferences; Parents; Peer culture; Pre-school children; Siblings",,,,,,,,,,"Bandura, A., Social learning theory (1977) Englewood Cliffs., , NJ: Prentice-Hall; Barron, B., Martin, C.K., Takeuchi, L., Fithian, R., Parents as learning partners in the development of technological fluency (2009) Internation Journal of Learning and Media, 1 (2), pp. 55-77. , http://life-slc.org/docs/barron-parentsaslearningpartners.pdf, Retrieved from; Bronfenbrenner, U., Ecology of the family as a context for human development: Research perspectives (1986) Developmental Psychology, 22, pp. 723-724; Bronfenbrenner, U., (1979) The ecology of human development: Experiments by nature and design, , Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press; Buckingham, D., Children and new media (2006) The handbook of new media: Updated student edition, pp. 75-91. , in L.

Old people and their practices of new media use are discussed in light of the concepts of age cohort, generation and media generation. The article detects homology between individualization (a backbone of the second modernity as defined by Ulrich Beck) in the management of new risks and operation of new media language. Consequently, the concept of ""double individualization of responsibility"" is coined and connection is made to the effects of new media and new risks on ontological security. The argument is taken further onto the ground of critical gerontology, which claims that individual decision-making and fluidity of the second modernity is a source of insecurity and anxiety mainly for the old people. The article eventually presents the area of e-health as a research field for further exploration of how old people experience autonomy, individual decision making, and the absence of (or conflict with) external authority while dealing with the health risks on-line. © 2008 Cyberpsychology.","Media generation; New media; New risks; Old age; Ontological security",,,,,,,,,,"Bakardjieva, M., (2005) Internet society: The Internet in everyday life., , London: Sage; Beck, U., (1992) Risk society: Towards a new modernity., , London: Sage; Beck, U., (2004) Riziková společnost [Risk society]., , Praha: Slon; Bourdieu, P., (1993) Sociology in question., , London: Sage; Boyce, T., Lewis, J., (2009) Climate change and media., , New York: Peter Lang Publishing; Bruns, A., Produsage, generation C, and their effects on the democratic process (2007) Media in transitions 5: Creativity, ownership, and collaboration in the digital age., , Cambridge: MIT Press; Buckingham, D., Willett, R., (2006) Digital generations: Children, young people, and new media., , Mahwah: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates; Czaja, S.J., Lee, C.C., (2007) The impact of aging on access to technology., 5, pp. 341-349. , Universal Access in the Information Society; Kapitola 8: Senioři a moderní informační a komunikační technologie (2010) Chapter 8: Old people and modern information and communication technologies, , http://www.czso.cz/csu/2010edicniplan.nsf/t/1100338FC9/$File/1417-10k08.pdf, ČSÚ, [Czech Statistical Office], Retrieved from; Edmunds, J., Turner, B.S., (2002) Generations, culture and society., , Philadelphia: Open University; Eyerman, R., Turner, B.S., Outline of a theory of generations (1998) European Journal of Social Theory, 1, pp. 91-106; Giddens, A., (1990) The consequences of modernity., , Stanford: Stanford University Press; Haddon, L., (2000) Social exclusion and information and communication technologies: Lessons from studies of single parents and the young elderly., 2, pp. 387-406. , New Media & Society; Hesse, B.W., Enhancing consumer involvement in health care (2009) Health communication in new media landscape, pp. 119-144. , In J.C.

The theoretical framework combines diverse perspectives: the Yom Kippur War and its consequences on Israeli society; theories of generations and media generations, war and trauma, war and remembrance; and Israel's collective memory and culture of remembrance. An integrated methodology offline and online was conducted: multi-sited and multimodal ""Thick Description"" ethnography and netnography; critical discourse analysis and semiotics of texts and artifacts; and in-depth interviews with veterans and historians. Findings are constructed on three levels: first - analysis of veterans' interrelations with common Israeli culture of memory, and their active participation as a ""remembrance community"" in creating cultural artifacts offline and online; second - interpretation of Israeli cultural codes in battlefield ""actuality"", even under the most traumatic conditions; and third - the universal state level, analysis of the deep conflict impelling the remembrance community to write the Yom Kippur War battles also as history in their cybersite, thus attaining public recognition. This case study demonstrates the war veterans' ability of ""Breaking the Silence"", empowering their traumatised community by bridging the ""generation gap"" of their ""actual"" ""media generation"", by merging their comradeship and high cultural capital, towards official affirmation within Israeli military history. © 2008 Cyberpsychology.","Battle-trauma; Cultural capital; Digital memorialisation; Media generations; Multi-sited and multimodal ethnography; Netnography; Remembrance community",,,,,,,,,,"Adoni, H., Nossek, H., The new media consumers: Media convergence and the displacement effect (2001) Communications: The European Journal of Communication Research, 26 (1), pp. 59-83; Allen, J.M., Brown, S.D., Embodiment and living memorials: The affective labour of remembering the 2005 London bombings (2011) Memory Studies, 4, pp. 312-327; Arieli-Horowitz, D., (1999) Romanticism of Steel: Art and Politics in Nazi Germany, , Jerusalem: Magnes Press; Barthes, R., Myth today (1972) Mythologies, pp. 109-159. , In A.

First, we explore how adolescents and adults approach the disclosure of personal information and the application of privacy settings on social network sites (SNS). Second, we investigate whether the factors that predict these two privacy-management strategies differ for adolescents and adults. To achieve the goals of this study, an online survey was conducted among a sample of 1484 SNS users ranging in age from 10 to 65 years. In addition to gender and age, we investigated the following predictors: frequency of and motives for SNS use, trust in other users, peer influence and concerns related to privacy and contact risks. The results show that adolescents disclose more personal data and apply more lenient privacy settings to these data than adults do. Several factors were found to affect disclosure and profile-access management, with differences between adolescents and adults in some cases. Finally, we discuss implications emerging from the study's findings. © 2008 Cyberpsychology.","Adolescents; Adults; Privacy settings; Self-disclosure; Social network sites",,,,,,,,,,"Acquisti, A., Gross, R., Imagined communities: Awareness, information sharing, and privacy on the Facebook (2006) Privacy Enhancing Technologies, 4258, pp. 36-58; Bearden, W.O., Netemeyer, R.G., Teel, J.E., Measurement of consumer susceptibility to interpersonal influence (1989) Journal of Consumer Research, 15, pp. 473-481; Bilton, N., Facebook changes privacy settings to enable facial recognition (2011) The New York Times, , http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/06/07/facebook-changes-privacy-settings-to-enable-facial-recognition/, June 7, Retrieved from; Britten, N., Facebook users warned about burgarly risk (2010) The Telegraph, , http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/facebook/8004716/Facebook-users-warned-of-burglary-risk.html, September 15, Retrieved from; Brown, B.B., Klute, C., Friendships, cliques, and crowds (2003) The Blackwell Handbook of Adolescence, pp. 330-348. , In G.

We explored the psychometric properties of implicit measures assessing aggressiveness objectively: the Implicit Association Test (IAT) and its derivate, the Single-Target IAT. While the IAT focused on the automatic attitude towards aggressiveness, the ST-IAT focused on the self-concept. This feasibility study describes in methodological detail how a diversity of game players can be recruited to take these measures with common web-browser technology, even though reaction-time measurement in the range of a few hundred milliseconds is at stake. Self-reported and objective characteristics of users of violent, less violent, and no games differed. The results are partly in line with what can be expected on the basis of psychological theorizing, but structural-equation modelling shows that implicit measures on attitudes and self-concept differ in quality. Pitfalls and challenges for internet studies on computer players involving reaction-time measures are pointed out. © 2008 Cyberpsychology.","Aggressiveness; Computer games; Implicit association test; Internet; Single-target IAT",,,,,,,,,,"Anderson, C.A., Aggression (2002) The Encyclopedia of Sociology, , In E.

Despite the fact that Fattorello had been a member of the founding group of the International Association of Media and Communication Research IAMCR/AIERI in Paris, 1957, today his work is not known at an international level, especially in the Anglo-Saxon academia. This is due to the fact that when Fattorello's theory was developed, it was not taken into consideration because of the dominance of the Frankfurt School theorizations that individualized in mass communication a process that determined people's behaviors. Sixty years ago it was not easy for scholars and those employed in industry to accept Fattorello's idea of an audience who had equal dignity to the promoting subject, because s/he had the same thinking abilities. Instead of accepting the idea that the media industry enterprises imposed values, behaviors and patterns that served to maintain domination, Fattorello focused on audiences as active participants, as the pivot of the process of communication. We will see that the diagrammatic formula in which Fattorello's model is expressed looks very similar to something with which we are very familiar; that is the Web communication paradigm. Fattorello's model, which is significantly different than some of the current mainstream theoretical approaches to media and communication, is compared to dominant mass communication models (from the earliest models to contemporary dominant paradigms) to further enrich the debate. Finally, we believe that Fattorello's model can shed light on other models of mass communication. © 2008 Cyberpsychology.","Mass communication; Online communication; Theory of communication",,,,,,,,,,"Adorno, T., (1973) The Jargon of Authenticity., , Illinois: NorthWestern University Press; Appadurai, A., (1997) Modernity at Large., , Minneapolis: Minnesota Press; Carey, J.W., A Cultural Approach to Communication (1975) Communications, 2, pp. 1-22; Fattorello, F., (2005) Teoria della tecnica sociale dell'informazione., , Urbino: Quattroventi; Gauntlett, D., Ten Things Wrong with the Media Effects' Model (1998) Approaches to Audiences-A Reader, , http://www.theory.org.uk/david/effects.htm, In R.

The present study investigated whether the theoretical concepts of Routine Activities Theory (RAT) could account for patterns of cyberstalking victimization among social networking site users. The study employed a self-report survey design using a convenience sample of 321 female undergraduate students. RAT was operationalized in the cyber context by measuring the level of online disclosure, frequency of internet use (online exposure) and general proclivity for risk-taking behaviours among participants. Personal experiences of cyberstalking were also assessed. Analyses specifically examined the relationship between RAT variables and cyberstalking outcomes and the extent to which a specific form of guardianship, online disclosiveness, served as a mediator between online activities and the risk for victimization. Online exposure and a proclivity for social risk-taking were associated with cyberstalking victimization. Levels of online disclosure demonstrated a direct positive impact on cyberstalking victimization, however our findings elucidating the role of online disclosure as a guardianship effort mediating the effects of exposure on cyberstalking victimization were mixed. © 2008 Cyberpsychology.","Cyberstalking; Online disclosure; Routine activity theory; Social networking",,,,,,,,,,"Alexy, E.M., Burgess, A.W., Baker, T., Smoyak, S.A., Perceptions of cyberstalking among college students (2005) Brief Treatment and Crisis Intervention, 5, pp. 279-289; Alshalan, A., (2006) Cyber-crime fear and victimization: An analysis of a national survey, , (Doctoral dissertation).

Users are able to create and share photos and videos with speed and ease. A much different trend has emerged with these new technological affordances, though. Individuals are utilizing this new media and are creating and sharing sexually explicit user-generated content (SEUGC) of themselves. Four hundred undergraduate students completed an online survey to assess their likelihood to create and share SEUGC in the future. Social cognitive theory (Bandura, 1986) was the framework used to analyze the factors that propel this behavior. Results suggest the influence of viewing pornography, sexual self-efficacy, and entertainment and arousal outcomes as triggers and motivators for engaging in this behavior. The model also revealed a desensitization effect towards negative consequences that might occur from creating and sharing SEUGC. © 2008 Cyberpsychology.","Cybersex; Mobile phones; Sexuality; Social cognitive theory; User-generated content; Web 2.0",,,,,,,,,,"Albright, J., Sex in America online: An exploration of sex, marital status, and sexual identity in internet sex seeking and its impacts (2008) Journal of Sex Research, 45, pp. 175-186; Ballard, S., Sources of sexuality information for university students (1998) The Journal of Sex Education and Therapy, 23, pp. 278-287; Bandura, A., (1971) Psychological modeling: Conflicting theories., , Chicago: Aldine-Atherton; Bandura, A., Barab, P., Processes governing disinhibitory effects through symbolic modeling (1973) Journal of Abnormal Psychology, 82, pp. 1-9; Bandura, A., The Self System in Reciprocal Determinism (1978) American Psychologist, 33, pp. 344-358; Bandura, A., (1986) Social foundations of thought and action: A social cognitive theory., , New Jersey: Prentice Hall; Bandura, A., Perceived self-efficacy in the exercise of control over AIDS infection (1990) Evaluation and Program Planning, 13, pp. 9-17; Bandura, A., Social Cognitive Theory of Self-Regulation (1991) Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes, 50, pp. 248-287; Bandura, A., Social cognitive theory: An agentic perspective (2001) Annual Review Psychology, 50, pp. 1-26; Bandura, A., Social cognitive theory of mass communication (2008) Media effects: Advances in theory and research, pp. 94-125. , In J.

Online depression communities offer immediate support for both genders, and may reduce the risk for those depressed men who avoid the traditional mental healthcare system. This study aimed to explore gender differences among members of online depression communities. Based on an online survey of 793 members of 16 online depression communities, the study combined both behavioral and psychological measures. The results identified significant gender differences in members' self-defined condition, participation patterns, interests and reported benefits. Additional differences were found in the associations between the main differentiating variables and the members' level of depression. The findings indicated that women in online depression communities are more involved and report more benefits from participation than men. However, active participation may be even more beneficial for men than for women, as it may provide positive change not only in their general sense of well-being, but also in their clinical condition. Using strategies for promoting active participation among men may enhance the benefits they gain from the online communities. © 2008 Cyberpsychology.","Coping; Mental illness; Online support groups; Well-being",,,,,,,,,,"Affifi, M., Gender differences in mental health (2007) Singapore Medical Journal, 48, pp. 385-391; Alexander, S.C., Peterson, J.L., Hollingshead, A.B., Help is at your keyboard: Support groups on the Internet.

The latter has been indicated as an important variable influencing college student drinking behavior, with students tending to overestimate the quantity and frequency of other students' alcohol use. To better understand alcohol-related content students are exposed to online, researchers viewed college students' Facebook profiles, recording the presence of alcohol-related content. A total of 68 college men and women participated by allowing researchers to view their Facebook page, recording the amount of alcohol-related content, and completing a brief survey on which they reported alcohol use and perceived drinking norms. Results indicated 76.5% of participants' profiles contained alcohol-related content. This included a substantial proportion of underage participants. The presence of a significant relationship between alcohol-related content on Facebook and reported alcohol use, and between reported alcohol use and perceived alcohol use of Facebook Friends suggest social networking sites may contribute to perceived drinking norms and should be addressed in future intervention efforts aimed at reducing college alcohol abuse. © 2008 Cyberpsychology: Journal of Psychosocial Research on Cyberspace.","Alcohol; College drinking norms; Facebook; Social networking sites",,,,,,,,,,"Bandura, A., (1977) Social Learning Theory, , Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice Hall; Bandura, A., (1986) Social Foundations of Thought and Action: A Social Cognitive Theory, , Upper Saddle River, NJ: Prentice Hall; Bosari, B., Carey, K.B., Peer influences on college drinking: A review of the research (2001) Journal of Substance Abuse, 13, pp. 391-424; Carter, C.A., Kahnweiler, W.M., The efficacy of the social norms approach to substance abuse prevention applied to fraternity men (2000) Journal of American College Health, 49, pp. 66-71; Ellickson, P.L., Collins, R.L., Hambarsoomians, K., McCaffrey, D.F., Does alcohol advertising promote adolescent drinking?

This study investigated whether a person's relationship status presented on his/her online profile is related to virtual self-presentation on the German Web 2.0 site StudiVZ. Considering the social psychological concept of the ""need to belong"" (Baumeister & Leary, 1995), we assumed that users who are searching for a relationship make use of certain self-presentational strategies, for example by creating a more detailed profile and placing high priority on the display of a large network of social bonds. An analysis of 100 online profiles showed that singles disclosed more photographs of themselves on their profiles than people in relationships. The highest numbers of friends and wall postings were shown by people who did not reveal their relationship status. Singles displayed more groups on their profile and were more likely to join user groups dealing with parties, sexual statements as well as fun and nonsense. Results therefore indicate that - although SNS are not especially dedicated to dating behavior - self-presentation is nevertheless affected by the potential to form romantic relationships. Therefore, relationship status is suggested as a further factor which affects online impression management, besides, for example, socio-demographic aspects, personality traits and culture. © 2008 Cyberpsychology: Journal of Psychosocial Research on Cyberspace.","Impression management; Need to belong; Self-presentation; Social networking sites",,,,,,,,,,"Banczyk, B., Krämer, N.C., Senokozlieva, M., (2008) The Wurst"" Meets ""fatless"" in MySpace. the Relationship Between Personality, Nationality and Self-presentation in An Online Community, , Paper presented at the annual meeting of the International Communication Association, Montreal, Canada; Baumeister, R.F., Leary, M.R., The need to belong: Desire for interpersonal attachments as a fundamental human motivation (1995) Psychological Bulletin, 117, pp. 497-529. , doi:10.1037/0033-2909.117.3.497; Boyd, D.M., Ellison, N.B., Social network sites: Definition, history, and scholarship (2007) Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication, 13, pp. 210-230. , doi:10.1111/j.1083-6101.2007.00393.x; Buffardi, L., Campbell, K., Narcissism and Social Networking Web Sites (2008) Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, 34, pp. 1303-1314. , doi:10.1177/0146167208320061; Cialdini, R.B., Borden, R.J., Thorne, A., Walker, M.R., Freeman, S., Sloan, L.R., Basking in reflected glory: Three (football) field studies (1976) Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 34, pp. 366-375. , doi:10.1037/0022-3514.34.3.366; Debatin, B., Lovejoy, J.P., Horn, A.-K., Hughes, B.N., Facebook and Online Privacy: Attitudes, Behaviors, and Unintended Consequences (2009) Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication, 15, pp. 83-108. , doi:10.1111/j.1083-6101.2009.01494.x; Deci, E.L., Ryan, R.M., The ""what"" and ""why"" of goal pursuits: Human needs and the self-determination of behavior (2000) Psychological Inquiry, 11, pp. 227-268. , doi:10.1207/S15327965PLI1104_01; Derlega, V.J., Metts, S., Petronio, S., Margulis, S.T., (1993) Self-Disclosure, , Newbury Park, CA: Sage; Donath, J., Boyd, D., Public displays of connection (2004) BT Technology Journal, 22, pp. 71-82. , doi:10.1023/B:BTTJ.0000047585.06264; Ellison, N., Heino, R., Gibbs, J., Managing impressions online: Self-presentation processes in the online dating environment (2006) Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication, 11, pp. 415-441. , doi:10.1111/j.1083-6101.2006.00020.x; Ellison, N., Steinfield, C., Lampe, C., The benefits of Facebook 'friends': Exploring the relationship between college students' use of online social networks and social capital (2007) Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication, 12, pp. 1143-1168. , doi:10.1111/j.1083-6101.2007.00367.x; Ellison, N., Steinfield, C., Lampe, C., Connection Strategies: Social capital implications of Facebook-enabled communication practices (2011) New Media & Society, 13, pp. 873-892. , doi:10.1177/1461444810385389; Gibbs, J.L., Ellison, N.B., Heino, R.D., Self-Presentation in Online Personals: The Role of Anticipated Future Interaction, Self-Disclosure, and Perceived Success in Internet Dating (2006) Communication Research, 33, pp. 152-177. , doi:10.1177/0093650205285368; Gibbs, J., Ellison, N.B., Lai, C., First comes love, then comes Google: An investigation of uncertainty reduction strategies and self-disclosure in online dating (2011) Communication Research, 38, pp. 70-100. , doi:10.1177/0093650210377091; Goffman, E., (1959) The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life, , Garden City, NY: Double Day; Gosling, S.D., Gaddis, S., Vazire, S., (2007) Personality Impressions Based on Facebook Profiles, , http://www.icwsm.org/papers/3--Gosling-Gaddis-Vazire.pdf, Paper presented at the International Conference on Weblogs and Social Media, Boulder, Colorado, U.S.A; Jung, T., Youn, H., McClung, S., Motivations and self-presentation strategies on Korean-based ""Cyworld"" weblog format personal homepages (2007) CyberPsychology and Behavior, 10, pp. 24-31. , doi:10.1089/cpb.2006.9996; Haferkamp, N., Krämer, N.C., Creating a digital self.

It focuses mainly on the impacts and consequences of cyberbullying, and on the coping strategies chosen by victims to deal with the situation. The data was obtained through semi-structured interviews with 15 adolescents aged 14-18 years, all of whom were cyberbullying victims. It was found that cyberbullying experiences led to changes in the victims' behaviour, and that these could be positive in the form of behavioural changes in cyberspace. Mainly this was due to victims creating a cognitive pattern of bullies, which consequently helped them to recognise aggressive people. Bullying also provoked feelings of caution, and brought about restriction in the use of risky online sources of threats as victims tried to prevent its recurrence. Critical impacts occurred in almost all of the respondents' cases in the form of lower self-esteem, loneliness and disillusionment and distrust of people: The more extreme impacts were self-harm and increased aggression towards friends and family. Based on their experience, the victims of cyberbullying developed coping strategies in order to cope with cyberbullying. These strategies took several forms: technical defence, activity directed at the aggressor, avoidance, defensive strategies, and social support. The activities of the victims when dealing with this stressful situation varied, which was probably influenced by different contexts, personal traits, and the development of the respondents. The findings further revealed that some coping strategies (i.e. technical coping or telling parents) are in many situations either non-functional or just cannot be used, a theme which is further discussed with respect to previous research in the field. © 2008 Cyberpsychology: Journal of Psychosocial Research on Cyberspace.","Adolescence; Bully; Coping; Cyberbullying; Victim",,,,,,,,,,"Aftab, P., Wired SAFETY, , http://www.wiredsafety.org/, (n.d.), Retrieved from; Beran, L., Li, Q., Cyber-Harassment: A Study of a new method for an old behavior (2005) Journal of Educational Computing Research, 32, pp. 265-277. , http://people.ucalgary.ca/./2005CyberBeranLi_JECR.pdf, Retrieved from; Campfield, D.C., (2006) Cyberbullying and Victimization: Psychosocial Characteristics of Bullies, Victims, and Bully-victims, , http://etd.lib.umt.edu/theses/available/./umi-umt-1107.pdf, (Doctoral dissertation), Retrieved from; Campbell, M., Cyber bullying: An old problem in a new guise?

A theoretical approach is presented that is grounded in a social identity perspective of groups and seeks to promote and support successful collaborations. Using this approach, along with examples from laboratory and field studies, key concepts such as cohesion, participation, accountability and group norms are addressed and contrasted with more traditional approaches. It is suggested that design features that 'collectivise' rather than 'personalise' CSCL can promote psychological issues that are crucial for successful collaborations (i.e. group cohesion, accountability to the group, and increased participation), and norms for success can be developed through intergroup comparisons. The theoretical approach is also presented as a platform from which further investigations and predictions can be made. © 2008 Cyberpsychology: Journal of Psychosocial Research on Cyberspace.","Cohesion; Collaborative learning; E-learning; Psychology; Social identity",,,,,,,,,,"Alpay, E., Group dynamic processes in email groups (2005) Active Learning in Higher Education, 6, pp. 7-16; Brandon, D.P., Hollingshead, A.B., Collaborative learning and computer-supported groups (1999) Communication Education, 48, pp. 109-126; Cole, M., Using Wiki technology to support student engagement: Lessons from the trenches (2009) Computers & Education, 52, pp. 141-146; Chambers, E., Contexualizing the CEFES project: A selective review of the computer conferencing literature (2000) Teaching Across Frontiers: A Handbook for International Online Seminars, , In H.

The adolescents, 237 girls and 225 boys, completed a computer-administered questionnaire which examined sexual behaviour offline and sexual activities on the Internet. Individuals who reported any offline sexual experience tended to engage in online sexual activities more often than those who did not. The use of the Internet for sexual purposes was similar for those who had experienced kissing and/or petting, it then increased, being similar for those who had experienced oral sex and/or sexual intercourse. Findings suggest that the relationship between the gradual extension of sexual experience offline and the gradual extension of using the Internet for sexual purposes is rather weak. © 2008 Cyberpsychology: Journal of Psychosocial Research on Cyberspace.","Adolescence; Czech republic; Internet; Sexuality",,,,,,,,,,"Baumeister, R.F., Gender differences in erotic plasticity: The female sex drive as socially flexible and responsive (2000) Psychological Bulletin, 126, pp. 247-374; Bauserman, R., Davis, C., Perceptions of early sexual experiences and adult sexual adjustment (1996) Journal of Psychology and Human Sexuality, 8, pp. 37-59; Boies, S.C., University studentś uses of and reactions to online sexual information and entertainment: Links to online and offline sexual behaviour (2002) Canadian Journal of Human Sexuality, 11 (2), pp. 77-89; Braun-Courville, D.K., Rojas, M., Exposure to sexually explicit web sites and adolescent sexual attitudes and behaviors (2009) Journal of Adolescent Health, 45, pp. 156-162; Brown, B.B., Feiring, C., Furman, W., Missing the love boat: Why researchers have shied away from adolescent romance (1999) The Development of Romantic Relationships in Adolescence, pp. 1-16. , In W.

Frequency of Internet use was not related to symptoms of depression, but three of the types of use (starting the day on the Internet, visiting news sites, viewing videos) reduced symptoms of depression. Internet use was generally related to more face-to-face interaction, suggesting that Internet use is used to augment rather than replace social interaction. However, the significant relationships between Internet use and quality of relationships with parents and significant others tended to be negative. These results are discussed in relation to ""The Rich Get Richer"" and the ""Social Compensation"" approaches. Binge drinking and drug use were related to Internet use that might be used to promote social activities. Visiting a sexually explicit web site was the exception, and suggests it could serve a purpose similar to substance use. Grade point average (GPA) was both positively and negatively associated with specific types of Internet use, but the most surprising finding was a positive association between GPA and visiting sexually explicit sites. This finding is discussed from the perspective of the ""challenge hypothesis."" Overall, the findings suggest that the past emphasis in research on Internet addiction may have resulted in a bias toward negative findings. © 2008 Cyberpsychology: Journal of Psychosocial Research on Cyberspace.","Challenge hypothesis; College students; Depression; Internet use; Rich-get-richer",,,,,,,,,,"(2009) Healthy Minds.

These Internet tools expand TV's potential influence on human development. Yet little is known about the kinds of values these shows portray. To explore this issue, a new method for conducting content analysis was developed; it used personality indices to measure value priorities and desire for fame in TV programming. The goal was to document historical change in the values communicated to tween audiences, age 9-11, who are major media consumers and whose values are still being formed. We analyzed the top two tween TV shows in the U.S. once a decade over a time span of 50 years, from 1967 through 2007. Greenfield's (2009a) theory of social change and human development served as the theoretical framework; it views technology, as well as urban residence, formal education, and wealth, as promoting individualistic values while diminishing communitarian or familistic ones. Fame, an individualistic value, was judged the top value in the shows of 2007, up from number fifteen (out of sixteen) in most of the prior decades. In contrast, community feeling was eleventh in 2007, down from first or second place in all prior decades. According to the theory, a variety of sociodemographic shifts, manifest in census data, could be causing these changes; however, because social change in the U.S. between 1997 and 2007 centered on the expansion of communication technologies, we hypothesize that the sudden value shift in this period is technology driven. © 2008 Cyberpsychology: Journal of Psychosocial Research on Cyberspace.","Adolescence; Content; Fame; Media; TV; Tween; Values",,,,,,,,,,"Bandura, A., Social cognitive theory of mass communication (2001) Media Psychology, 3, pp. 265-299; Baumeister, R.F., How the self became a problem: A psychological review of historical research (1987) Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 52, pp. 163-176; Brock, T., Young adults and higher education: Barriers and breakthroughs to success (2010) Future of Children, 20, pp. 109-132; Brooks-Gunn, J.B., Donahue, E.H., Children and electronic media: Introducing the issue (2008) The Future of Children, 18 (1), pp. 3-10; Buckingham, D., Childhood in the age of global media (2007) Children's Geographies, 5, pp. 43-54; Buckingham, D., Selling childhood (2007) Journal of Children and Media, 1, pp. 15-24; Calliser, M.A., Robinson, T., Content analysis of physical affection within television families during the 2006-2007 season of U.S. children's programming (2010) Journal of Children and Media, 4, pp. 155-173; (2008), http://www.clearpictureonline.com/1960-Food-College-Income.html, ClearPictureOnline.com, Retrieved from; Comstock, G., Paik, H., (1991) Television and The American Child, , New York: Academic Press; Dey, E.L., Astin, E.W., Korn, W.S., (1991) American Freshman: 40 Year Norms, , The American Freshman HERI: UCLA; Eder, D., Nenga, S.K., Socialization in adolescence (2003) Handbook of Social Psychology, pp. 157-175. , In J.

Data were analyzed for 320 participants, all of whom were employed and had access to computers at work. Results indicate that external Locus of Control predicts all three forms of Internet abuse. The desire to use the Internet for diversion and entertainment purposes predicts only online shopping and searching for non-work-related information. Results suggest that factors predicting some forms of Internet abuse may not predict other forms of Internet abuse.

Seventy-four low-income African American 12- to 18-year-old adolescents were randomly assigned to a 30-minute condition: 1) solitary Wii tennis exergame play against virtual peers; 2) social Wii tennis exergame play against a real peer; or 3) control group with sedentary computer activity. Adolescents were tested for caloric expenditure after exposure to treatment conditions as well as on a tennis court using Actical accelerometers. Adolescents who played the social exergame against a peer expended significantly more energy than those who played alone. Both exergame groups expended more energy than the control group. Adolescents who played the social exergame also expended comparable calories to actual tennis court play during a simulated lesson. Exergames, then, could promote physical activity, thereby becoming a tool to combat the obesity crisis that is affecting many youth. © 2008 Cyberpsychology: Journal of Psychosocial Research on Cyberspace.","Accelerometer; Exergames; Physical activity; Video games",,,,,,,,,,"Ainsworth, B.E., Haskell, W.L., Whitt, et, al., Compendium of physical activities: An update of activity codes and MET intensities (2000) Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise, 32, pp. S498-S516; (2005) American College of Sports Medicine's Guidelines for Exercise Testing and Prescription, , American College of Sports Medicine, 7th ed.
