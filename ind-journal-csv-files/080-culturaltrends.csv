We outline the development and content of the framework–including its principles, aims and values–in the context of both Irish cultural policy history and the “whole-of-government” policy approach. To interrogate the coherence of the policy framework, we focus on the creative industries in general, and the audiovisual sector, in particular. We question whether Culture 2025’s, broad incorporation of various sectors (language, arts, heritage, and creative industries), can say anything of significance about the promotion of culture in Ireland. Through the integration of pre-existing strategies into the Irish economic system, we argue that Culture 2025 presents itself as the only realistic approach to culture and the arts in the form of a “cultural policy realism”. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","arts policy; audiovisual; creative industries; Cultural policy; Ireland; national policy development",,,,,,"National University of Ireland, Galway, NUI Galway","We would like to thank Daniel Carey, NUI Galway, for reading and commenting on a draft of this paper.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Bacchi, C., (2009) Analysing Policy: What’s the Problem Represented to be?, , Pearson Australia; Bacchi, C., Introducing the ‘what’s the problem represented to be?’ Approach (2012) Engaging with Carol Bacchi, Strategic Interventions and Exchanges, pp. 21-24. , Bletsas A., Beasley C., (eds), University of Adelaide Press,.

However, it has often been invisible in the eyes of policy and policymaking. As soon as the spread of Covid-19 started impacting local and national economies across the globe, many industry and policy bodies rushed into researching the impact of Covid-19 on the creative and cultural industries (CCIs) and the workers in the sector. The paper offers an insight into the key concerns of these organizations through the meta-analysis of the survey and research projects that are currently being undertaken in the context of the UK. The results highlight common concerns in relation to visible and invisible issues that need addressing in the sector. The paper concludes by questioning if Covid-19 represents a moment of crisis for the sector or has simply exposed the unsustainable price of creative and cultural work. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Covid-19; creative and cultural industries; Creative and cultural work; creative careers; precarity; resilience",,,,,,"Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020: 822314","Dr Roberta Comunian would like to thank the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme (No. 822314) “Developing inclusive and sustainable creative economies” (DISCE) www.disce.eu .

Three influences on career progression are given special attention: state patronage, geographic location and networks. There is strong evidence to show that those interviewed consider state patronage as very important to their career development, particularly in relation to “breakthrough” events. Even this group depends on outside work, particularly in advertising, to supplement incomes. Our findings confirm that prominent creative workers tend to be geographically concentrated and consider such proximity to other creative workers as important. A very large proportion of them also consider networks/personal connections as very important to career success, in terms of three main advantages: work/job contacts, the generation of new ideas and moral support/understanding. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Creative careers; film/TV; geographic location; networks; state funding; theatre",,,,,,,"This work was supported by Creative Ireland.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Abbing, H., (2002) Why are Artists Poor: The Exceptional Economy of the Arts, , Amsterdam University Press; Andersson, A.Å.D., Daghbashyan, Z., Hårsman, B., Location and spatial clustering of artists (2014) Regional Science and Urban Economics, 47, pp. 128-137. , https://doi.org/10.1016/j.regsciurbeco.2013.09.008; Ashton, D., Creative work careers: Pathways and portfolios for the creative economy (2015) Journal of Education and Work, 28 (4), pp. 388-406. , https://doi.org/10.1080/13639080.2014.997685; Banks, M., Hesmondhalgh, D., Looking for work in creative industries policy (2009) International Journal of Cultural Policy, 15 (4), pp. 415-430. , https://doi.org/10.1080/10286630902923323; Barton, R., Murphy, D., (2020) Ecologies of Cultural Production: Career Construction in Irish Film, TV Drama and Theatre, , https://www.creativeireland.gov.ie/app/uploads/2020/03/ECP.pdf, Trinity College Dublin; Bielby, W., Bielby, D., Organizational mediation of project-based labor markets: Talent agencies and the careers of screenwriters (1999) American Sociological Review, 64 (1), pp. 64-85. , https://doi.org/10.2307/2657278; Borowiecki, K., Geographic clustering and productivity: An instrumental variable approach for classical composers (2013) Journal of Urban Economics, 73 (1), pp. 94-110. , https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jue.2012.07.004; Bourdieu, P., (1993) The Field of Cultural Production, , Polity Press; Bridgstock, R., Goldshmith, B., Rodgers, J., Hearn, G., Creative graduate pathways within and beyond the creative industries (2015) Journal of Education and Work, 28 (4), pp. 333-345. , https://doi.org/10.1080/13639080.2014.997682; Bronfenbrenner, U., (1979) The Ecology of Human Development: Experiments by Nature and Design, , Harvard University Press; Caves, R., (2002) Creative Industries: Contracts Between Art and Commerce, , Harvard University Press; Collins, R., (1998) The Sociology of Philosophies: A Global Theory of Intellectual Change, , Harvard University Press; Comunian, R., Faggian, A., Jewell, S., ‘Winning and losing in the creative industries: An analysis of creative graduates’ career opportunities across creative disciplines’ (2011) Cultural Trends, 20 (3-4), pp. 291-308. , https://doi.org/10.1080/09548963.2011.589710; (2017) Census of population 2016–Profile 10 Education, Skills and the Irish Language, , https://www.cso.ie/en/releasesandpublications/ep/p-cp10esil/p10esil/; Frey, B., Pommerehne, W., (1989) Muses and Markets: Explorations in the Economics of the Arts, , Blackwell; Greffe, X., (2002) Arts and Artists from an Economic Perspective, , UNESCO, (English edition; Hellmanzik, C., Location matters: Estimating cluster premiums for prominent modern artists (2010) European Economic Review, 54 (2), pp. 199-222. , https://doi.org/10.1016/j.euroecorev.2009.06.001; Jensen, M., Kim, H., Reaching for the stars: The importance of reputational rank in creative career development (2019) Poetics, , https://doi.org/10.1016/j.poetic.2019.101396, online 24 December; Lincoln, A., Cultural honours and career promotions: Re-conceptualizing prizes in the field of cultural production (2007) Cultural Trends, 16 (1), pp. 3-15. , https://doi.org/10.1080/09548960601106904; Lingo, E., Tepper, S., Looking back, looking forward: Arts-based careers and creative work (2013) Work and Occupations, 40 (4), pp. 337-363. , https://doi.org/10.1177/0730888413505229; Mangset, P., Heian, M., Kleppe, B., Løyland, K., ‘Why are artists getting poorer?

Claims for what the arts “do” to people and the ways in which they can bring about both individual and societal transformation are plentiful, not seldom in association with a wider debate about the rationales for public support of the arts. Consequently, the reflection on participation in the arts, and its implications for cultural policies, has gained in relevance. In Flanders, the recognition of participatory arts practices within the framework of the Arts Decree is illustrative in that vein. In this article, we argue, however, that the ongoing debate fails to be explicit about the underlying agendas to which this social role intentionally and/or unintentionally accommodates. We aim to enrich this debate by reporting on the findings of semi-structured interviews with art intermediaries working within different art organisations in Flanders and Brussels. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","art institutions; art intermediaries; Arts; arts’ social role; policy attachment",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Alexander, V.D., (2011) Enterprise culture and the arts: How government imposed neoliberal values on art institutions in England, , [Invited paper presented].

My reflections are informed by a comprehensive literature review as well as by my ongoing research into the impact of austerity on local authority museum services. The literature surveyed allows for an analysis both of the alignment between the strategy and broader political rhetoric and discourses of austerity and welfare state retrenchment and of the tension between the rhetoric of ""Let's Create"" and the realities facing local authorities and publicly funded cultural organisations. I argue that the strategy's indirect acknowledgement of the negative impact of austerity policies is obscured by gestures towards diversity, inclusion and cultural pluralism, which leaves difficult questions of how to translate the strategy's ambitions into actual action unanswered. In conclusion, ""Let's Create"" is found to be a stark illustration of Arts Council England's acquiescence to the politics and discourses of austerity and the marginalisation of alternative values and practices which, as the literature shows, are alive and well within museums and the cultural sector. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","arts funding; austerity; Cultural policy; local authorities; local authority museums",,,,,,"European Commission, EC

The article demonstrates how considering the cultural economy’s typical business models and resultant work and employment practices allows understanding that the inclusion and diversity impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic will be driven by more than workers’ differing abilities to buffer short-term income insecurity. The article highlights four areas relevant to inclusion and workforce diversity that research and policy responses to COVID-19 should attend to in revising existing and designing new responses to the COVID-19 pandemic. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","COVID-19; cultural economy; inclusion; screen industries; workforce diversity",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Adams, L., Tindle, A., Downing, C., Morrice, N., Domingos, M., (2018), https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/756414/access-to-work-qualitative-research-with-applicants-employers-and-delivery-staff.pdf, Access to work: Qualitative research with applicants, employers and delivery staff.

It carries out an assessment of the literature on visitor motivation to attend museums and galleries, including visiting as a learning experience and as an environment for well-being. It also considers the role of visitor location in determining the factors behind the visit. Following our adoption of a visitor survey, this paper carries out a demographic visitor profile before considering our findings on geographical location, engagement with the museum and marketing engagement (including by visitor location). The study then carries out a series of independent t-tests with respect to visitor location, followed by ANOVA calculations with respect to the overall mean findings for different subgroups. Following this, confirmatory factor analyses determine item suitability, with four factors being identified.

Drawing on quantitative data about the contemporary distribution of French music tastes, we note that a large majority of individuals are eclectic. Although social class remains a significant structuring variable, age appears as another critical factor in the distribution of individuals’ taste for certain genres and artists. Deploying a regression analysis including a comparative “average partial effect” coefficient, we show the effect of age in the distribution of music taste. Specifically, we analyse data about how age cohorts express different levels of appreciation for music artists, which enables us to identify the relationship between individuals and music that has emerged and developed at a certain time. We argue that music taste is acquired in relation to two intertwined principles: individuals’ age and the cultural times that mediate the presence of music genres and their encounters with them. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","age cohorts; cultural times; eclecticism; music genres; Music taste",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Atkinson, W., The context and genesis of musical tastes: Omnivorousness debunked, Bourdieu buttressed (2011) Poetics, 39 (3), pp. 169-186. , https://doi.org/10.1016/j.poetic.2011.03.002; Bennett, T., Savage, M., Silva, E., Warde, A., Gayo-Cal, M., Wright, D., (2009) Culture, Class, Distinction, , Routledge; Bourdieu, P., (1984) Distinction: A Social Critique of the Judgement of Taste [1979, , Harvard University Press; Chan, T.W., Goldthorpe, J.H., Social stratification and cultural consumption: Music in England (2007) European Sociological Review, 23 (1), pp. 1-19. , https://doi.org/10.1093/esr/jcl016; Coulangeon, P., La stratification sociale des goûts musicaux.

We introduce a new layer to this debate by bringing to the fore the format of the cultural product, distinguishing between “live” cultural products (concerts, exhibitions, live shows) and “recordings” (distributable items such as books or music albums). Using culture sections of newspapers (The Guardian, Le Monde, ABC, El País, Helsingin Sanomat, Dagens Nyheter) from 1960 to 2010 (n = 11,775) we ask what role the format of the cultural product plays for the highbrow/non-highbrow trajectories over time. We show that highbrow coverage faces a relative decline, mostly explained by the expanding non-highbrow arts coverage. Moreover, coverage on live events decreases, while coverage of recordings grows. This trend reflects the highbrow/non-highbrow divide, revealing that the “decline of the highbrow” phenomenon is under closer scrutiny a “decline of the highbrow live event”. © 2020, © 2020 The Author(s).

Findings draw on the annual attitudinal survey of 16-year-olds in Northern Ireland, Young Life and Times (2016), and four follow-up focus group discussions. Results complement existing cultural participation research, which relates forms of engagement with intersectional factors: age, location of residence, gender and income. Reflecting, to some degree, the specificities of the study’s location in Northern Ireland, we also found that cultural participation and understandings of what counts as culture have strong connections to history, place, religion, tradition and family. Furthermore, while participants placed a high level of personal importance on the informal activities in which they engage daily, those activities associated with tradition and family were perceived as having higher cultural importance. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Cultural participation; cultural value; Northern Ireland; young people",,,,,,,"The Young Life and Times (YLT) survey is part-funded by: NI Executive Office, the Department of Education, the EU Programme for Peace and Reconciliation in Northern Ireland and the Border Regions of Ireland, the Community Relations Council, the Carnegie Young People Trust, and Sport NI.

Since the 1980s, surveys have almost invariably focused on accredited institutions, thereby omitting half of the museums in the UK. In this article we examine how data collection became tied to the accreditation scheme and its effects on how the museum sector is represented as a professionalised sphere. While is important to understand the role of surveys in constructing the museum sector, this article also demonstrates how the inclusion of unaccredited museums drastically changes the profile of the museum sector. We outline the inclusive research methodology of the Mapping Museums project team and compare our findings with those produced when a survey is limited to accredited museums. In so doing, we sketch out an alternative, heterogeneous version of the UK museum sector and make recommendations based on that evidence. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","classification; data collection; ethics; Museums; professionalism",,,,,,"Arts and Humanities Research Council, AHRC","This work was supported by the Arts and Humanities Research Council under the Standard grant scheme.

To address how the methodology is understood as participatory, the article outlines five existing definitions of “a participatory methodology”–based on co-creation, co-decision, local project-building, empowerment and issue construction–and discusses to what extent these definitions can be used to understand the research setup and process, which was based on 20 exchange and data collection visits performed by cultural centre employees across Europe. The article argues that this kind of participatory research experiment is interesting for researchers and their cultural partners as it stresses inventiveness, creates a focus on multivalent research outcomes, and engages cultural institutions and workers in processes of epistemic modernisation. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","cultural centre; Cultural participation; epistemic modernisation; inventive methods; methodology; multivalence",,,,,,"Aarhus Universitet, AU","The research presented in this article was funded collectively by Aarhus European Capital of Culture 2017, the European Network of Cultural Centres/ENCC (Creative Europe), Kulturhusene i Danmark/KHiD, the cultural centre Godsbanen and Aarhus University, Denmark.

The Audiovisual Action Plan (“the Plan”) sets out the Department’s approach to the audiovisual industries and is, it is contended, evidence of a marketization of culture consistent with a creative industries perspective. The analysis of the Plan in a wider policy context identifies key issues shaping audiovisual production in Ireland. Using a thematic analysis approach from Braun and Clark (2005, 2019) a number of themes are developed from analysis of the relevant policy documents, broadly conceived around the increasing instrumentalism of culture. Taking a political economy perspective allows for development of themes around the commodification of the nation-state through the provision of policies that actively encourage a certain type of audiovisual production. Building on Mosco’s work on political economy (Mosco, 2009) the concept of spatialization from Lefebvre (Lefebvre, 1991) is used to interrogate the production of and commodification of space through Specifically, this article interrogates the policy norms underpinning the Audiovisual Action Plan introduced by the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht in Ireland in 2018 as part of Culture 2025, the national cultural policy framework. It identifies the key proposals which affect the audiovisual industries. It is concluded that the Plan (and other relevant policy documents) support a spatialized, commodified view of the audiovisual industries as primarily industrial in nature, paying scant attention to the consideration of such industries as cultural forces. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","audiovisual industries; audiovisual policy; creative industries; Irish film; political economy; spatialisation",,,,,,"Federation for the Humanities and Social Sciences

We explore the impact of arts establishments on income in US zip codes, nationally and across quantiles (from four to seven subgroups) of zip codes stratified by disadvantage (based on income and ethnicity/race). We focus on what is new here: how neighbourhood scenes or the mixes of amenities mediate relationships between the arts and income. One dramatic finding is that more bohemian/hip neighbourhoods tend to have less income, contradicting the accounts from Jane Jacobs, Richard Florida and others. Arts and bohemia generate opposing effects, which emerge if we study not a few cases like Greenwich Village, but use more careful measures and larger number of cases. Some arts factors that distinctly influence neighbourhood income include the number of arts establishments; type and range of arts establishments; levels of disadvantage in a neighbourhood; and specific pre­ and co­existing neighbourhood amenities. Rock, gospel and house music appeal to distinct audiences. Our discussion connects this vitalizing role for arts activity to broader community development dynamics. These overall results challenge the view that the arts simply follow, not drive, wealth, and suggest that arts-led strategies can foster neighbourhood revitalization across a variety of income, ethnic, and other contexts. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","arts; creative placemaking; culture-led regeneration; income growth; local economic development; Neighbourhood revitalization; scenescapes",,,,,,"National Endowment for the Arts, NEA: 1844331-38-C-18","This work was supported by National Endowment for the Arts [grant number 1844331-38-C-18].",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Becker, H.S., (2008) Art Worlds, , revised edition), Berkeley: University of California Press; Benjamin, W., (2002) The Arcades Project, , R.

School-community arts partnership stakeholders collaborate because of shared missions to provide students with valuable arts learning experiences. Investigations of these initiatives indicate that these partnerships improve arts learning opportunities and increase public support and resources for arts education. However, not much is known about the experiences and perspectives of the arts organizations that participate in these partnerships. Coordinating collective efforts with a multitude of institutions and interests poses challenges. In this study, we examine survey data collected from arts organization administrators who participated in a large-scale school-community arts partnership initiative. We find that these organizations are generally positive about their impacts on students’ educational outcomes, but there is substantial variation in these views. We also find that organizations differ in their levels of support for these collective efforts. Sources of this variation appears to be attributable to organizations’ preexisting resources and extent to which they are established. While this difference in levels of support is potentially inevitable, we find evidence that the operations handled by the “backbone” organization, i.e. the initiative’s facilitators and overseers, can significantly influence organizations’ levels of support for these efforts. Organizations are more likely to support these collaborative efforts when they believe the backbone organization ensures transparency with initiative operations, provides regular, effective communication, and effectively resolves competing priorities. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Arts education; cultural organizations; education policy; mixed-method evaluation; school-community partnerships; teaching-artist residencies",,,,,,"Houston Endowment

This participatory programme evaluation uses mixed-methods to assess the effectiveness of an alternative, performing arts education-based approach to media literacy called The Girl Project (TGP), a feminist artist-activist programme based at a non-profit community theatre in Versailles, Kentucky. The 12–18 high school-aged girls who participate in TGP every year are engaged in workshops by guest artists from around the nation to express what they think is important for their audiences to understand about their lived experiences as girls in a conservative sociopolitical environment. The project employed “youth-adult partnership model” to programme evaluation that involved working with programme alumni as co-researchers to evaluate TGP 2017. In June 2017, a team of eight co-researchers comprising alumni from the 2014, 2015, and 2016 classes met to develop evaluation questions and make data collection decisions. Data collection included surveys and interviews conducted pre- and post-programme with participants, field notes of the co-researchers’ observations of workshops and rehearsals, and feedback from guest artists and audience members. The team met again in January 2018 to collaboratively analyse how the data answered their evaluation questions. The survey data allowed us to see that girls’ statistical scores on mental health and body confidence measurements significantly improved after their participation in TGP, meaning that girls are less vulnerable to depression, anxiety, and eating disorders. In talking with participants and audience members, we learned that TGP participation increases girls’ self-confidence and ability to set boundaries in friendships, family relationships, and romantic relationships. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","doing gender; feminist pedagogy; girls’ studies; Media literacy education; participatory evaluation; YPAR",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Calogero, R.M., Objects don’t object evidence that self-objectification disrupts women’s social activism (2013) Psychological Science, , 0956797612452574; Cheadle, A., Cahill, C., Schwartz, P.M., Edmiston, J., Johnson, S., Davis, L., Robbins, C., Engaging youth in learning about healthful eating and active living: An evaluation of educational theater programs (2012) Journal of Nutrition Education and Behavior, 44 (2), pp. 160-165; Chen, P., Lazar Weiss, F., Johnston Nicholson, H., Girls study girls Inc.: Engaging girls in evaluation through participatory action research (2010) American Journal of Community Psychology, 46 (1-2), pp. 228-237; Fredrickson, B.L., Roberts, T.-A., Objectification theory (1997) Psychology of Women Quarterly, 21 (2), pp. 173-206; Freire, P., (2014) Pedagogy of the oppressed: 30th anniversary edition, , New York: Bloomsbury Publishing; Guzmán, B.L., Casad, B.J., Schlehofer-Sutton, M.M., Villanueva, C.M., Feria, A., CAMP: A community-based approach to promoting safe sex behaviour in adolescence (2003) Journal of Community & Applied Social Psychology, 13 (4), pp. 269-283; Hollander, J.A., “I Demand more of people” Accountability, interaction, and gender change (2013) Gender & Society, 27 (1), pp. 5-29; Jeong, S.-H., Cho, H., Hwang, Y., Media literacy interventions: A meta-analytic review (2012) Journal of Communication, 62 (3), pp. 454-472; Katz, J., Bystander training as leadership training: Notes on the origins, philosophy, and pedagogy of the mentors in violence prevention model (2018) Violence Against Women, 24 (15), pp. 1755-1776; Katz, J., Heisterkamp, H.A., Fleming, W.M., The social Justice roots of the mentors in violence prevention model and its application in a high school setting (2011) Violence Against Women, 17 (6), pp. 684-702; Kimmel, M., (2012) Manhood in America: A cultural history, , New York: Oxford University Press; Landay, E., Wootton, K., (2012) A reason to read: Linking literacy and the arts, , Cambridge: Harvard Education Press; Lindberg, S.M., Hyde, J.S., McKinley, N.M., A measure of objectified body consciousness for preadolescent and adolescent youth (2006) Psychology of Women Quarterly, 30 (1), pp. 65-76; McGladrey, M.L., Lolita is in the eye of the beholder: Amplifying preadolescent girls’ voices in conversations about sexualization, objectification, and performativity (2015) Feminist Formations, 27 (2), pp. 165-190; Moradi, B., Huang, Y.-P., Objectification theory and psychology of women: A decade of advances and future directions (2008) Psychology of Women Quarterly, 32 (4), pp. 377-398; Ozer, E.J., Douglas, L., Assessing the key processes of youth-Led participatory research: Psychometric analysis and application of an observational rating scale (2015) Youth & Society, 47 (1), pp. 29-50; West, C., Zimmerman, D.H., Doing gender (1987) Gender & Society, 1 (2), pp. 125-151; Yager, Z., Diedrichs, P.C., Ricciardelli, L.A., Halliwell, E., What works in secondary schools?

The paper begins with an overview of recent diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives in the arts & cultural sector–highlighting the systemic issues leading to the need for such initiatives and presenting a typology for organisational responses to the issue. This paper then categorise the type of organisational change sought by The Art Institute of Chicago based on Fraser’s two-dimensional social justice conditions and remedies framework in order to assess whether or not the Art Institute is achieving its goal of attracting, retaining, and empowering a diverse set of students and influencing their decision to pursue a career in the museum field by providing an equitable and inclusive environment during the internship.

What is unclear, however, is why high-educated individuals are more likely to participate in the arts. Economic models indicate that price, income, and background are relevant to attendance, but the role these factors play among high-educated groups, like college students, remains underexplored. This study sheds light on what makes college students more likely to participate in the arts by evaluating a university’s investment in arts programming on campus. We analyse data from an experiment in which a university made substantial investments in arts programming largely centred on increasing access to the arts by providing more free programmes. Using pre- and post-intervention survey data, we analyse changes in students’ reported level of arts participation and barriers to arts involvement. The results from our analyses show that background, such as familiarity and experience in the arts, is the strongest predictor of increased arts participation among college students when prices are reduced. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","accessibility; Arts participation; arts socialization; higher education; impact; programme evaluation",,,,,,"National Endowment for the Arts, NEA: 17-3800-7015","This project was supported in part or in whole by an award from the Research: Art Works programme at the National Endowment for the Arts: Grant# 17-3800-7015.

This paper will argue that the role these factors play in the art of policy making problematises conventions in the current global/local (glocal) debate circulating in the arena of Cultural Policy Studies. The paper shows that cultural policy making in the Caribbean constitutes a mélange of approaches that are in a constant state of contestation during the policy-making process. It employs content analysis of cultural policy texts from selected Caribbean states, as well as an analysis of stakeholder views from the national cultural policy consultations in Trinidad and Tobago to derive its findings. A Five Factor framework was developed to illustrate the range of responses that guide and shape local actors and activities in the national cultural policy domain. The research concludes that the relationship between the national and local (nocal) actors has to be re-imagined if cultural policy is to deliver on its promise of social transformation in the Caribbean. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Caribbean cultural sector; Cultural policy, Regional and Local Caribbean Cultural policies",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Babb, A., (2017) Creative Truth to Power: Draft Mapping of Barbados’ Creative and Cultural Industries, , Bridgetown: Cultural Industries Development Authority; Bartley, S., (2011) Framework for National Cultural Policy of St. Kitts & Nevis, , Basterre: St. Kitts and Nevis National Commission for UNESCO; Best, L., Independence and responsibility (1996) The Critical Tradition of Caribbean Political Economy, The Legacy of George Beckford, pp. 3-18. , Levitt K., Witter M., (eds), Kingston: Ian Randle Publishers,.

Focusing on Switzerland, a federalist country where local and private actors play key roles in cultural policy, several processes by which different actors participate in local cultural policy-making are explored. Top-down procedures, such as formalised mandatory consultation procedures or the inclusion of cultural actors in administrative expert committees, coexist with bottom-up grassroots initiatives that can complement or even supplant traditional participatory processes. Furthermore, certain alternative modes and concepts of participation, such as the “cultural council”, circulate between different cases, across levels of state and in time. Participatory processes in cultural policy-making need to be seen as public policies in their own right, which can aim to depoliticise policies and procedures. Furthermore, actors need certain resources in order to participate, and venues aimed at opening participation do so in a restrained framework, focusing mostly on artistic and cultural elites rather than encourage larger citizen participation. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","cultural actors; Cultural policy; local policy; participation; policy-making; Switzerland",,,,,,"Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung, SNF: P1GEP1_158600",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Ancel, P., Pessin, A., (2004) Les non-publics.

Policy mobilities as comparison: Urbanization processes, repeated instances, topologies. Revista de Administração Pública, 52(2), 221–243] of a globalized drive towards more creative cities. While the value of mobilizing culture for local urban change in rapidly growing cities of the global South is increasingly recognized [Mbaye, J., & Dinardi, C. (2018). Ins and outs of the cultural polis: Informality, culture and governance in the global South. Urban Studies, 56(3), 578–593], postcolonial urban scholars have rightly questioned whether internationally popular cultural policy approaches are able to speak to their complex challenges, underpinned by informality and the after-effects of colonialism [Pieterse, E. (2006). Building with ruins and dreams: Some thoughts on realising integrated urban development in South Africa through crisis. Urban Studies, 43(2), 285–304]. As postcolonial states are slowly shifting away from a centralized cultural institution model linked to symbolic nation building projects [Booyens, I. (2012). Creative industries, inequality and social development: developments, impacts and challenges in Cape Town. Urban Forum, 23(1), 43–60], travelling cultural policies brought in by foreign agencies and adapted by local epistemic communities have inspired a range of responses that can be broadly described as cultural policy innovation from below Cohen, D. (2015). Grounding mobile policies: Ad hoc networks and the creative city in Bandung, Indonesia. Singapore Journal of Tropical Geography, 36(2015), 23–37]. In turn, we examine how different cultural policy approaches have been locally mobilized and reworked in Bandung and Cape Town in response to situated realities and in partnerships between cultural, academic, business and local government actors. We argue that comparing the emerging “creative cityness” [Nkula-Wenz, L. (2018a). Worlding Cape Town by design: Encounters with creative cityness. Environment and Planning A: Economy and Space, 1–17] of both cities provides valuable insights into the opportunities and challenges of urban cultural governance in the global South. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Bandung; Cape Town; creative cities network; Cultural change; cultural urban governance; UNESCO",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Barrowclough, D., Kozul-Wright, Z., (2008) Creative Industries and Developing Countries: Voice, Choice and Economic Growth, , London: Routledge; Booyens, I., Creative industries, inequality and social development: Developments, impacts and challenges in Cape Town (2012) Urban Forum, 23 (1), pp. 43-60; Booyens, I., Rogerson, C.M., Creative tourism in Cape Town: An innovation perspective (2015) Urban Forum, 26 (4), pp. 405-424; (2015) World Design Capital: Cape Town 2014: The Story of an African City, , Cape Town: Cape Town Design NPC; (2017) City of Cape Town: Integrated Development Plan, , http://resource.capetown.gov.za, Retrieved from; Cohen, D., Grounding mobile policies: Ad hoc networks and the creative city in Bandung, Indonesia (2015) Singapore Journal of Tropical Geography, 36 (2015), pp. 23-37; Comunian, R., Rethinking the creative city: The role of complexity, networks and interactions in the urban creative economy (2011) Urban Studies, 48 (6), pp. 1157-1179; Dinardi, C., Unsettling the role of culture as panacea: The politics of culture-led urban regeneration in Buenos Aires (2015) City, Culture and Society, 6 (2), pp. 9-18; Duxbury, N., Cultural governance in sustainable cities (2014) Agora, 1 (1), pp. 165-182; Edensor, T., Leslie, D., Millington, S., (2009) Spaces of Vernacular Creativity: Rethinking the Cultural Economy, , Hoboken: Taylor & Francis, (eds; Evans, G., Creative cities, creative spaces and urban policy (2009) Urban Studies, 46 (5-6), pp. 1003-1040; Evans, G., Curson, T., Foord, J., Shaw, P., (2007) Cultural Planning Toolkit: Report on Resources: Guidance, Toolkits and Data, , http://www.citiesinstitute.org/library/v58000_3.pdf, Retrieved from; Fahmi, F.Z., McCann, P., Koster, S., Creative economy policy in developing countries: The case of Indonesia (2017) Urban Studies, 54 (6), pp. 1367-1384; Grodach, C., Silver, D., (2013) The Politics of Urban Cultural Policy: Global Perspectives, , New York, NY: Routledge; Hamann, R., Boulogne, F., Kranz, N., Pienar, S., (2009) What makes cross-sector partnerships successful ?

This paper explores the tensions between policy making for the nation-state and for “the local” through comparative research on the arts councils (and equivalent bodies) in Scotland, England and Northern Ireland. Drawing on in-depth qualitative interviews with senior representatives from these organisations, it explores their notions of, responsibilities to and affiliations with “the local”. Findings suggest that despite their different models and relationships to the nation-state, and the disparities in the scale of investment, these national policy bodies commonly rely on networked governance to facilitate their relationship to “the local” which risks reproducing national interests, limiting the localised agency of place-based approaches and contributing to a culture of competition within cultural policy. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","arts councils; cultural democracy; Cultural policy; devolution; local authorities; place",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"(2013) Achieving Great Arts and Culture for Everyone, , London: Arts Council England; (2016) Minutes of the Midlands Area Council Meeting No. 19, , https://www.artscouncil.org.uk/our-organisation/area-councils, December 6, 2017.

There has, however, been a re-emergence of craft, which may not be scalable in the same way, into public debate, with benefits linked to educational, cultural and economic policy agendas. Accordingly, policymakers have begun to view craft as a stimulus to develop local and regional economies, skills and materials in relation to wider networks. Within this push towards craft-driven creative place making and economic growth, it has been argued that more sophisticated understandings of the “local” are needed that go beyond those which are inward and parochial. Based on AHRC-funded empirical research undertaken in the Northern Isles of Scotland with craft practitioners, this article attempts to provide evidence of the place-based nature of craft work highlighting both opportunities as well as constraints linked to contexts that are often referred to as remote and peripheral when contrasted with urban locations. We argue for future investigation into, what we term, fractal growth–growth and development that considers multiple dimensions–as being a valid and valuable outcome of creative practice, and which cannot be easily scaled. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Craft; cultural assets; fractal growth; innovation; lived experience; local",,,,,,"Arts and Humanities Research Council, AHRC: AH/P013325/1","Funded by the AHRC [grant number AH/P013325/1] and with thanks to the stakeholders and participants in DING across the H&I region.

This paper combines two radically different datasets to draw new insights into booking patterns of audiences for contemporary arts events. Quantitative data from Audience Finder has been analysed to look for trends in early and late booking amongst audiences for contemporary art forms. Qualitative data has been drawn from the Understanding Audiences for the Contemporary Arts study, which used in-depth individual interviews to investigate the contemporary arts attendance of audience members in four UK cities. Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis was then used to draw out insights about where the purchasing point sits within the longer decision to attend. Following a review of marketing and audience research literature on the decision to attend, we present the findings from each of these analyses, looking at moments where they confirm, supplement, contradict, or say something completely outside the remit of the other dataset. We show how the timescale of the decision to attend is influenced by (1) art form conventions and price, (2) geographical region and availability of the arts, (3) attending arts events with companions, and (4) personal preference for planning or spontaneously choosing activities. We end by suggesting a new three-part model for understanding booking patterns, and considering how these insights might be acted upon by arts organisations. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

The methodology was developed as part of the “Beyond the Multiplex: audiences for specialised films in English regions” (BtM) project. This project required a mixed methods approach using surveys, interviews, focus groups and document analysis to explore the richness of audience experiences and trends in the context of regional film policy. This required a mixed methods approach using surveys, interviews, focus groups and document analysis. The project utilised a data model approach that uses the principles of a computational ontology in order to sort, order and categorise data for systematic interrogation. The paper discusses methods, data, coding, and the use of a data model to support data analysis. We argue that this approach enables the cross referencing of data that provides a rich, multi-layered and relational understanding of film audiences but requires time and attention to data management and coding. Although, additionally it also forms the basis of an open access data resource for future research. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

It is an image-led, group-based method that creates a “third space” research setting to observe audience groups re-enacting lived experience of an event or process that takes place in the third space of a cultural setting. In this article, the method is described through its use in relation to an art-science exhibition, Human+ Future of the species, where three audience groups with investments in technology worked with exhibition material to achieve a complex ambivalent state of mind regarding technological futures. The visual matrix has been designed to capture the affective and aesthetic quality of audience engagement in third space by showing what audiences do with what is presented to them. We argue that such methodologies are useful for museums as they grapple with their role as sites where citizens not only engage in dialogue with one another but actively re-work their imaginaries of the future. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","aesthetic third; civic museum; cultural imaginary; technology; third space; Visual matrix",,,,,,"Australian Research Council, ARC: LP150100481","This study was supported by the ArtScience Museum Singapore.

This question is particularly important in the context of debates over the power of new forms of data to supplant the “traditional” survey methods that have underpinned our understanding of the social stratification of culture. This paper compares three data sources on attendance: the Active Lives Survey, the Taking Part Survey, and Audience Finder. We first compare self-reported attendance at events in each English local authority from the Active Lives survey with ticket sales data, finding a close relationship. We follow up by comparing the distributions of ticket buyers across the Indices of Multiple Deprivation with those from Taking Part, finding that for widely-ticketed and widely-attended art forms they track closely together, providing support for existing trends. Ticketing data does not seem to offer more information on social stratification than traditional social science sources. However, we extend the comparison through more detailed analysis of subcategories within less well-researched forms–literature and dance events–where numbers of attendees are lower, with accompanying uncertainty in survey sources. We find that the audiences for dance vary widely, with ballet attendance being heavily socially stratified but attendance at contemporary dance much more similar to the general population. However, we find that audiences for literature events are more heavily socially stratified than almost any other art form, almost regardless of the subcategory. The power of new datasets is in offering specificity about artforms, rather than overturning what we know about culture and inequality. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

Recalling a series of empirical projects conducted over the past ten years with a range of theatre practitioners, it examines the conflicts involved in carrying out scholarly studies of audience reception against cultural organisations’ pressures to produce their own ongoing audience evaluations. Examining key concerns about audience research raised by creative practitioners in varying theatrical contexts, from site-specific to building-based work, it addresses the difficulties of understanding live performance reception and aesthetic experience via impact frameworks. It begins by situating these three operations in the context of Knowledge Exchange (KE) between academics within Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) and those in the creative industry sector. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Audience research; cultural value; impact; knowledge exchange; live performance; theatre",,,,,,"British Academy: pf160070",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Allmer, T., Precarious, always-on and flexible: A case study of academics as information workers (2018) European Journal of Communication, 33 (4), pp. 381-395; (2016) Artists in Schools Toolkit, , http://www.artists-schools.com, Retrieved from; Barker, M., Mathijs, E., (2008) Watching The Lord of the Rings: Tolkein’s World Audiences, pp. 1-20. , New York: Peter Lang, &, (Eds; Barker, M., Mathijs, E., Introduction: The world hobbit project (2016) Participations, 13 (2), pp. 158-174; Belfiore, E., Bennett, O., (2008) The Social Impact of the Arts: An Intellectual History, , Basingstoke: Palgrave Macmillan; Chubb, J., Watermeyer, R., Wakeling, P., Fear and loathing in the academy?

In a world dominated by quantitative data, the Impact and Insight Toolkit addresses a perceived lacuna and marks a substantial investment in qualitative metrics. ACE also expects it to address a number of other concerns–help organizations self-evaluate, measure their short-term outcomes and advocate more effectively. Indeed, it envisages that an aggregation of the data collected will support the case for sustained public support of the sector. The Toolkit’s launch comes at a time when changes to the UK’s official statistics are encouraged, and policymakers are looking elsewhere to inform their thinking. The campaigning aspect of ACE’s aspirations suggests a model of data collection and analysis distinct from that of official statistics production, valued for its impartiality. This article considers what might happen if the Toolkit, which relates to ACE’s role as a development agency, encourages data to be collected and analysed in order to deliver specific outcomes. It reflects on three visions of cultural sector data from the past 50 years: Toffler’s The Art of Measuring the Arts, DCMS’s Taking Part and ACE’s Impact and Insight Toolkit. These suggest a trajectory of cultural sector data determined by increasing importance being attached to institutional interests, and implies that the future of cultural sector data in England may be determined by how ACE addresses its potentially conflicting interests as an official data provider and development agency. Greater investment in the former would more accurately reveal the arts’ contribution to economic and social development; greater investment in the latter would encourage the teleological development of cultural sector data designed for sectorial advocacy. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Arts Council England; evidence-based policy; Quality metrics; Taking Part; teleology; toolkit; toolkit",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"(2018) Relationship Framework, , https://www.artscouncil.org.uk/sites/default/files/download-file/NPO_2018-22_Relationship_Framework.pdf, Retrieved from; (2019) Our National Portfolio in Numbers, 2018-22, , https://www.artscouncil.org.uk/sites/default/files/download-file/Investment__factsheet_14082017.pdf, Retrieved from; (2019) National Portfolio Organisations 2018-22, , https://www.artscouncil.org.uk/national-portfolio-2018-22/more-data-2018-22, Retrieved from; Arts Council England Data Principles, , https://www.artscouncil.org.uk/research-and-data/our-data-principles, a,.

Policy reports and academic publications are reviewed to establish the priorities of arts policymakers and practitioners for understanding arts audiences and their continued focus on audience data and segmentation. This article then makes two contributions. Firstly, critical perspectives on the use of data for audience profiling are applied to arts audience segmentation. Secondly, research using biographical methods is introduced as a new approach for critically evaluating arts audience segmentation. This research, employing biographical methods, shows the exploration and negotiation of audience identity positions. This article takes these insights to critically examine the implications of how profiles and segments are used to define and understand audiences for the arts. The conclusion addresses the implications of segmentation in terms of the design and communication of cultural experiences, the complexities of aligning audiences’ identities with segments, and the seemingly inevitability of exclusion. This article will be of relevance in the scholarly study of arts audiences and for arts and cultural organisations and policymakers in reflecting on the implications of quantitative and qualitative approaches in designing and undertaking audience research. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Arts audiences; audience profiling; audience segmentation; biographical research; exclusion; research methods",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"What Is Arts Award, , https://www.artsaward.org.uk/site/?id=1346, Retrieved from; (2011) Arts Audiences: Insights, , https://www.artscouncil.org.uk/sites/default/files/download-file/arts_audience:insight_2011.pdf, Retrieved from; (2018) Shaping the Next Ten Years: Developing a New Strategy for Arts Council England 2020-2030, , https://www.artscouncil.org.uk/sites/default/files/download-file/Shaping%20the%20next%20ten%20years_consultation_online_oct2018.pdf, Retrieved from; (2018) Impact and Insight Toolkit, , https://www.artscouncil.org.uk/impact-and-insight-toolkit/impact-and-insight-toolkit-10-things-you-need-know, Retrieved from; Understanding Audience: An Arts Professional Partnership the Audience Agency, , https://www.artsprofessional.co.uk/magazine/audience-agency, Retrieved from; https://www.theaudienceagency.org/insight/webinar-audience-finder-enhancements, WebinarAudience Finder Enhancements.

The production was part of a trilogy of Shakespeare plays directed by Phyllida Lloyd, each staged with an all-female cast and each set within a women’s prison. Over the five years of developing this trilogy the Donmar undertook extensive research and development into the prison context, including in collaboration with York St John University’s Prison Partnership Project. This paper explores the prison audiences’ experiences of The Tempest, examining how they responded to seeing their own lived experiences on stage, filtered through the prism of Shakespearian plot, characterisation and language. In particular, this paper focuses on moments of identification, where the women found direct resonance and self-recognition with the characters and experiences in The Tempest. At the same time it draws on discourses from dramatherapy and aesthetic theory to argue for the importance of various forms of emotional, empathetic and psychical distance. Using close analysis of the spectators’ responses, it describes how for the prison audience the result was an oscillation between identification and distance, a reading of “me but more than me” that produced a powerful affective and reflective impact. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Audiences; empathy; prison; Shakespeare; spectatorship; theatre",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Balfour, M., Shakespeare in prisons conference, old globe theatre, San Diego, Friday 23rd–25th March 2018 (2019) Research in Drama Education: The Journal of Applied Theatre and Performance, 24 (2), pp. 209-210; Barker, M., (1998) Knowing Audiences, , Luton: University of Luton Press; Bates, L., The uses of Shakespeare in criminal rehabilitation: Testing the limits of ‘universality’ (2003) Shakespeare Matters: History, Teaching and Performance, pp. 151-163. , Davis L., (ed), Newark: University of Delaware Press,.

Drawing on historical visitor data and discourse analysis of official museum commentary on visitor behaviour, this article will assess Davies, Paton and Sullivan’s museum version of the Competing Values Framework and Wouter’s theory of informalisation as approaches to interpret how institutional traditions have interacted with wider social developments.

Yet little is known about how visit numbers to French museums developed. Compared to the Anglo-Saxon world, the collection and publication of visit data began late and was initially far from systematic. Some figures were collected in the late nineteenth century, but correspondence from the early twentieth century indicates that not even the Ministry of Fine Arts, overseeing the National Museums, was always aware of them. More complete numbers appeared from 1922 when entrance fees were introduced. However, visitors entering on free days were not yet counted. In the 1930s, data collection for the National Museums was systematized by the Directorate of National Museums, but figures were rarely published. The aim of this article is, therefore, to establish the sources that might be used for a quantitative approach to museum visiting in France and to reflect on the reasons for the initial indifference towards the counting of visitors and the standardisation with international practices over time. The article argues that the triggers for changes in the culture of counting in France were both internal and external. A prolonged debate about the introduction of entrance fees took place from the start of the Third Republic to the interwar years and let to the search for existing numbers in France and abroad. The Fine Arts Administration compiled data about practices in other countries and a number of monographs on the subject were published. The press also frequently referenced foreign examples. These documents provide a fascinating insight into comparisons and emulation of foreign practices at the time, allowing us to rethink the modern obsession with counting as the result of a transnational process. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","France; longitudinal data; Museums; transnational models; visit numbers",,,,,,"Seventh Framework Programme, FP7","Despite the importance given to the flow of objects, peoples and ideas in transnational and global history, such perspectives remain largely to be developed in relation to museum history (Gonzáles de Oleaga & Monge, 2009; Meyer & Savoy, 2013; Rolland & Murauskaya, 2008). For the last twenty years, some comparative statistics are available from Eurostat on the five most visited museums in every EU country (Deroin, 2009–2011). The European National Museums: Identity Politics, the Uses of the Past and the European Citizen (2010–2013) project funded by the Seventh Framework Programme of the European Commission, made insightful use of contemporary qualitative and quantitative visiting data, but there are no quantitative transnational historical analysis of museum visiting. Addressing this is necessary not only for a greater understanding of museums’ evolution, but also for comprehending the nature of cultural engagement, citizenship, and leisure. Only through a perspective that combines comparison with attention to interactions, is it possible to understand how and why practices differed within and between countries and how processes shaped each other beyond borders.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Série AA Direction Des Musées De France, Série T Musée Du Louvre; (1873) Série F21 4419-4420 Musées Nationaux, généralités; (2015), Number 267, April; Babbidge, A., Who’s counting whom?

This article examines the distinctive history of museum visits in Australasia through a comparative study of eight key institutions from across the region. Archival research was undertaken at each institution to compile as complete as possible a data set of annual visitation from opening until present day. Any stated changes in funding, admission charges, buildings etc. were also recorded, along with comments indicating contemporary explanations for fluctuations in visitation. Sources included official documents such as annual reports and trustee minutes, as well as visitor books and attendance records. We provide an initial overview of the quantitative and contextual data we collected from the case study museums focusing on a number of key questions: How have museums in Australasia been counting and reporting visit data over the past 150 years? What does this reveal about changes over time in the perceived value of visit data and museum attitudes towards their visitors? What are the key trends in museum attendance at the local, national and regional level in Australia and New Zealand? What contemporary explanations were given for fluctuations in museum attendance and are they supported by a long-term, cross-institutional comparison of the data? The study provides insights into historical shifts in thinking about the importance of visitors, appropriate methods for recording visitation, and the value of this data. The findings are also relevant to how museums today interpret attendance figures. The ways in which visit data were included or excluded from historical narratives about the value of museums highlights the constructed nature of visitor data and raises questions about the role of visitor research in contemporary museums. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Australia; historical; Museums; New Zealand; visitation; visitor research",,,,,,"Victoria University of Wellington","This work was supported by the Victoria University of Wellington University Research Fund.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"(1932) Annual Report for the Year Ending 31 March 1932, , Auckland: Auckland Art Gallery; (1968) Annual Report for the Year Ending 31 March 1968, , Auckland: Auckland Art Gallery; (1873) Report of the Auckland Institute for the Year Ending February 17, 1873, , Auckland: Auckland Institute; (1884) Report of the Auckland Institute and Museum for 1883–1884, , Auckland: Auckland Institute and Museum; (1886) Report of the Auckland Institute and Museum for 1885–1886, , Auckland: Auckland Institute and Museum; (1984) Annual Report of the Auckland Institute and Museum for 1983–1984, , Auckland: Auckland Institute and Museum; (1853) Daily Southern Cross, , October 28; (1999) Auckland War Memorial Museum Annual Report 1998/1999, , Auckland: Auckland Museum; (2000) Auckland War Memorial Museum Annual Report 1999/2000, , Auckland: Auckland Museum; (2009) Auckland War Memorial Museum Annual Report 2008/2009, , Auckland: Auckland Museum; (2010) Auckland War Memorial Museum Annual Report 2009/2010, , Auckland: Auckland Museum; (1882) Report of the Trustees for 1882, , Sydney: Australian Museum; (1941) Report of the Trustees for the Year Ended 30th June 1941, , Sydney: Australian Museum; (1982) Report of the Trustees of the Australian Museum for the Year Ended 30th June, 1982, , Sydney: Australian Museum; (1986) Report of the Trustees of the Australian Museum for the Year Ended 30th June, 1986, , Sydney: Australian Museum; Babbidge, A., Who’s counting whom?

However despite the capacity to scale-up, craftspeople and designer makers continue to challenge conventional capitalist ideas of what entrepreneurial “success” looks like. Drawing upon data from a 4-year study of Australian designer makers, this article problematizes the digital content-friendly growth and enterprise discourses at the heart of governmental desires for the creative economy; discourses that seemingly presume every entrant into the creative field aspires to be the multi-millionaire director of their own creative success story. It examines how the complex intersectionality of old understandings of artistic value and “doing what you love”, today mingle with ethical consumption values, environmental attentiveness, non-urban creative practice, the gendered exclusions of the creative workforce, and human desires for “good work” (Hesmondhalgh & Baker, 2011), to present a more complex, socially embedded picture of the contemporary creative economy.

The ecological fallacies of “exclusive” growth and the social and environmental injustices that “creative growth” has occasioned are initially discussed–and a range of possible other understandings of growth introduced. The article concludes that under conditions of real economic stagnation and incipient environmental crisis, growth needs to be made limited, but also more fully socialised in a dual sense; made more evenly and equitably redistributed in terms of benefits and rewards, as well as re-conceived in terms that afford greater priority to non-economic values and human prosperity indicators. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Creative economy; cultural futures; ecology; growth; policy",,,,,,,"Supporting commercial growth is the foundational premise of UK creative economy policy. In government reports and strategy documents (e.g. see DCMS, 2016b; DDCMS, 2017, 2018), in Minister’s public pronouncements (Hancock, 2017), and in the complementing work of agencies such as Nesta (2016), the dominant theme is investment in culture and creativity boosts economic activity and national output. Within the new UK Industrial Strategy (HM Government, 2017) the case for a creative industry Sector Deal has been strongly supported by Peter Bazalgette’s Independent Review of the Creative Industries (2017) and effective lobbying on the part of representative bodies such as the Creative Industries Council (2017). The creative economy growth agenda is also making new inroads into higher education policy and academic research funding; as I write the AHRC’S developing Creative Industries Cluster Programme – an £80 million investment in support of the Industrial Strategy – has entirely committed itself to funding “growth” (narrowly defined), while the joint AHRC/EPSRC Immersive Experiences programme dovetails neatly with the UK Digital Strategy (DDCMS, 2017) by prioritising opportunities to “grow the commercial and creative opportunities of the future” (AHRC, 2017).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"(2017) Research and partnership development call for the next generation of immersive experiences, , http://www.ahrc.ac.uk/documents/calls/immersive-call-guidance/, Retrieved from; Banks, M., (2017) Creative justice: Cultural industries, work and inequality, , London: Rowman and Littlefield International; Banks, M., (2018) Against creative growth, , CAMEo Conference (paper available on request), September; Bazalgette, P., (2017) The independent review of the creative industries, , https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/independent-review-of-the-creative-industries, DDCMS.

While municipal planners recognize the link between cultural activity and enhanced quality of life, related budget support typically calls for quantifiable outcomes. Creative economy policies and projects are thus vulnerable to favouring more narrowly construed forms of economic growth. We explore the municipally embedded artist-in-residence (AiR) programme as a source of friction, complexity and inefficiency intentionally introduced into organizations constitutionally regulated to suppress exactly these kinds of excesses. In Deleuzian terms, the social machinery of neoliberal urban and economic development hesitates when it encounters the short-circuiting unpredictabilities of creative desire introduced by the embedded residency. The municipally embedded AiR is a residual apparatus of creative economy policy that can offer resistance to and even inoculation against easy alliances with neoliberal economic agendas. In the case of an embedded AiR in city cemeteries in Edmonton, Canada, the artist, working on the grounds, meeting visitors and holding workshops, uses now-obsolete photographic craft production to manipulate conventional memorial images and texts in unexpected conjunctions with experimental aesthetic expression and living stories. The physical presence of the residency also disrupts received categories to produce the cemetery as living public space rather than a setting with “holes to put the past in”. In this sense, the cemetery becomes accessible as newly encoded, sustainable cultural and recreational space with minimal civic investment. Calling up ghosts of challenged creative economy ideals, this AiR opens new forms of engagement between citizens, local history and urban nature as a complex adaptive system that incorporates both cultural values and commodity logic without primary emphasis on quantifiable outcomes. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","aesthetics; Artist residencies; assemblage; creative economy",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Bain, A., McLean, D., From post to poster to post-industrial: Cultural networks and eclectic creative practice in Peterborough and Thunder Bay, Ontario (2013) Creative economies in post-industrial cities: Manufacturing a (different) scene, , Breitbart M.M., (ed), Farnham: Ashgate, &,.

We propose that the practice of multiple artforms is a common, albeit under-acknowledged, component of nimbly navigating artistic labour markets, alongside other strategies such as multiple jobholding and self-employment. While there are undoubtedly benefits to specialization, overall, we find that generalist arts alumni are more likely to continue working in the arts well after graduation. Being a multi-disciplinary artist is significantly associated with a range of entrepreneurial career activities, such as self-employment or freelancing, teaching in the arts, or managing an arts-related organization. Working across multiple artforms is connected to feeling satisfied with one’s education and career pathways, however multi-disciplinary artists are significantly less satisfied with the levels of job security and income that their current work provides. We conclude with implications for future research. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Artists; career; cultural and creative industries; multidisciplinary artists",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Becker, H.S., (1982) Art Worlds, , Berkeley: University of California Press; Bonin-Rodriguez, P., (2015) Performing Policy: How Contemporary Politics and Cultural Programs Redefined US Artists for the Twenty-first Century, , New York: Palgrave Macmillan; Bridgstock, R., Cunningham, S., Creative labour and graduate outcomes: Implications for higher education and cultural policy (2016) International Journal of Cultural Policy, 22 (1), pp. 10-26; Comunian, R., Faggian, A., Li, Q.C., Unrewarded careers in the creative class: The strange case of Bohemian graduates (2010) Papers in Regional Science, 89 (2), pp. 389-410; Cornfield, D.B., (2015) Beyond the beat: Musicians building community in Nashville, , Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press; Ellmeier, A., Cultural entrepreneurialism: On the changing relationship between the arts, culture and employment (2003) International Journal of Cultural Policy, 9 (1), pp. 3-16; Frenette, A., The rise of creative placemaking: Cross-sector collaboration as cultural policy in the United States (2017) The Journal of Arts Management, Law, and Society, 47 (5), pp. 333-345; Frenette, A., Tepper, S.J., What difference does it make?

As funders, educators and research bodies, universities have a complicated relationship with the creative economy. They propagate its practice, ‘buying-in’ to the rhetoric and models of creative value, particularly in teaching, research and knowledge exchange. Third mission activities also play a role, seeking to affect change in the world ‘outside’ academia through collaboration, partnerships, commercialisation and social action. For arts and humanities disciplines, these practices have focused almost exclusively on the creative sector in recent years. This paper asks how the third mission has been a site where universities have modified their function in relation to the creative economy. It considers the mechanisms by which universities have been complicit in propagating the notion of the creative economy, strengthening particular constructions of the idea at the level of policy and everyday practice. It also briefly asks how a focus on alternative academic practice and institutional forms might offer possibilities for developing a more critical creative economy. The argument made is that the university sector is an important agent in the shaping and performance of the creative economy, and that we should take action if we wish to produce a more diverse, equitable space for learning, researching, and being under the auspices of ‘creativity’. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","assemblage; Creative economy; third mission; universities",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"(2017) Creative Exchanges–The AHRC Knowledge Exchange Hubs for the Creative Economy, , Swindon: Arts and Humanities Research Council, AHRC; Araya, D., Cultural democracy: Universities in the creative economy (2010) Policy Futures in Education, 8, pp. 217-231; Bakhshi, H., Hargreaves, I., Mateos-Garcia, J., (2013) A Manifesto for the Creative Economy, , London: Nesta; Banks, M., Fit and working again?

This note considers the rises and falls of visit numbers amongst a sample of 15 London museums over a 160-year period, and how the institutions themselves perceived those figures. The data used here were gathered from the museums’ published annual reports and internal documents, including daybooks and memos. Their presentation here introduces readers to an exceptionally long time series, and to the conventionally neglected voices of museums’ managers, whose circumstances and attitudes informed those museums’ management. These notes show that certain external factors affected simultaneous rises and falls in the majority of museums’ figures across the sample, although there were always exceptions. Some trends are revealed as general tendencies over a number of years. Discrete internal factors, such as temporary closures and exhibitions create peaks and troughs at individual institutions. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","external factors; internal factors; interpretation; trends; Visit numbers",,,,,,"Greater London Authority, GLA

In relating historic context to current practice, it shows that, irrespective of the general use of visit numbers as a proxy for public interest and institutional importance, the practice of collecting museum visit numbers continues to be inconsistent and their publication erratic.

This article focuses on attendances at three national museums, in particular the British Museum, the National Gallery and, the Victoria & Albert Museum (formerly, the South Kensington Museum) over two periods: from the early 1850s to the late 1880s, and from the late 1970s to the present.

Most existing research relies on survey data concerned with visitors, their immediate background, and their experience of a particular museum. Very few studies have taken a more general perspective and analysed macro-level societal factors, such as inflation, educational attainment and unemployment, and their influence on the number of visits to museums. The conventional approach relies on visitor surveys to understand what drives visits and people’s general views on museums. In a departure from these conventional approaches, this article presents a macro-level approach, using a unique dataset of visit counts for 40 English museums and visitor attractions spanning the period 1850–2015. It examines the effect of socio-economic factors on visits using panel data analysis and macro-level variables. The results suggest that inflation rates, average earnings, and educational level (using the indicator of secondary school attendance) all significantly influence the number of visits made.

From the bidding stage, Aarhus 2017 claimed it put “participation” at the heart of its strategic plans, through consultation at roadshows and exhibitions. In addition, it aspired to use culture as a catalyst for development not only in the city of Aarhus but across the region of Central Denmark. This paper, therefore, examines how participation is defined and implemented to address regional development in the Aarhus 2017 process through textual analysis of documentation from Aarhus 2017 and delivery partners as well as over 20 interviews with managers and participants involved in a range of 2017 projects. The paper argues against the common prioritisation of urban and professional cultural institutions and makes the case for decentralised cultural provision that supports both amateurs and professionals through a regional networked structure. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Creative cities and regions; European Capitals of Culture; festivalisation; participation; regional development",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Bennett, A., Woodward, I., Taylor, J., (2014) The Festivalisation of Culture, , London: Ashgate; Bollo, A., Dal Pozzolo, L., Di Federico, E., Gordon, C., (2012) Measuring Cultural Participation.

The way in which charitable giving is subsidized differs across systems, but the equal treatment of very different charities is common to them. Given the different circumstances of the beneficiaries of these various of charities, how can the identical tax subsidy for donations be justified? One approach is to consider the charitable subsidy in light of egalitarian theories of justice and to ask whether a subsidy to charitable gifts to arts institutions that primary benefit the well-off could be justified within the theory. An alternative approach avoids the overarching theory of just distribution and focuses instead on the essentially political and practical aspects of the income tax. This essay considers both approaches, concluding that the latter is more appropriate to the question of the charitable subsidy, and that there is a case to be made for equal treatment of donation to charities with markedly different beneficiaries. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","charitable donations; Cultural policy; tax policy",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Alstott, A.L., Equal opportunity and inheritance taxation (2007) Harvard Law Review, 121, pp. 469-542; Andrews, W.D., Personal deductions in an ideal income tax (1972) Harvard Law Review, 86, pp. 309-385; Arneson, R.J., Equality and equal opportunity for welfare (1989) Philosophical Studies, 56, pp. 77-93; Batchelder, L.L., Goldberg, F.T., Orszag, P.R., Efficiency and tax incentives: The case for refundable tax credits (2006) Stanford Law Review, 59, pp. 23-76; Becker, G.S., Murphy, K.M., A theory of rational addiction (1988) Journal of Political Economy, 96, pp. 675-700; Bittker, B.I., Charitable contributions: Tax deductions or matching grants?

In turn, the spaces in which such activity takes place contribute strongly the functioning of local music and arts scenes. However, particularly in large Australian cities, there is a tension between economic development, fuelled by an extended property bubble, and the viability of small-to-medium live music venues. This tension is compounded by community attitudes toward arts and culture as well as a range of regulatory measures which govern the spaces in which this activity takes place. This paper examines the challenges inherent with developing and sustaining of live music venues in relation to the regulatory barriers associated with doing so. This paper draws on data from two qualitative examining producer accounts of live music operation in Perth, the capital of Western Australia, and Sydney, the capital of New South Wales. Both studies focused on the regulatory frameworks, and barriers associated with being able to support local, original contemporary music activity and were prompted following the closure of several highly supportive, high profile live music venues in each location. This research came in the wake of the so-called ‘lock out laws’, in the entertainment district of Kings Cross and surrounding suburbs, resulting in significant local and national debate around the impact and effectiveness of such laws. This paper is contextualised within debates relating to the importance of supportive live music venues, the challenges associated with developing, supporting and maintaining such spaces in light of gentrification and urban renewal strategies. As argued, these strategies, which work to enhance the vibrancy of cities–and often position arts and culture activity as being a vital component - often displace and/ or cause tensions for the spaces in which cultural and creative activity takes place during and after such regeneration. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","gentrification; Live music; regulation; urban development",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Atkinson, R., Easthope, H., The consequences of the creative class: The pursuit of creativity strategies in Australia’s cities (2009) International Journal of Urban and Regional Research, 33 (1), pp. 64-79; Atkinson, R., Wulff, M., Reynolds, M., Spinney, A., (2011) Gentrification and displacement: The household impacts of neighbourhood change, , AHURI Final Report 160,  1–89; Ballico, C., (2009) Regulating the notes: A case study into the impact of government regulation on the live music performances of Perth’s original contemporary musicians, , Honours thesis).

In more details, the paper researches the working conditions of graphic, web, interior and industrial designers in the Greek design industry and contributes to the understanding of the uneven regional geography of precariousness. We use a large dataset that was produced through an online questionnaire (Avdikos et al, 2015) and through descriptive statistics, we analyse the working conditions of three occupational categories: freelancers; full-time employees and owners of mainly very small design sector enterprises. The analysis shows that Greek designers work in particularly precarious conditions, considering their annual income, their working hours and their work-related injuries, especially compared with other service sectors of the Greek economy. Moreover, the spatial distribution of precariousness is highly uneven, especially for the full-time employees between the capital region of Attiki and the other 12 Greek regions. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Creative industries; design; Greece; labour; precariousness; regional",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Alper, N., Wassall, G.H., (2000) More than once in a blue moon: Multiple jobholdings by American artists, , Washington, DC: Santa Ana, CA: National Endowment for the Arts, Seven Locks Press; Avdikos, V., Kalogeresis, A., (2014) The creative and cultural industries in Europe during the times of recession; a statistical cross-country and sectoral analysis, , Presented at the Regional Studies Association European Conference, Izmir; Avdikos, V., Kalogeresis, A., Demetriades, K., Penlides, K., (2015) Creative survey 2015.

Each of the 888,246 poppies in the Tower's moat represented one British life lost in the First World War (FWW). This article uses a unique dataset of 1488 responses to the installation in order to probe the impacts of this high profile intervention. Systematic analysis of that data allows us to explore the centenary as a catalyst for remembrance activity, focusing on the kinds of “unthinking remembrance” that our research made visible. We detail how visitor responses activated a series of familiar tropes about past conflict, which often neglected recent work that has attempted to diversify perspectives about the past. This calls into question the extent to which policy objectives associated with pluralising narratives about the FWW during this centenary had been successful at this early stage in the commemoration and are likely to be successful in the future. As the “cult of the centenary” becomes ever more embedded within education and policy frameworks, and refracted within the programming of national media and cultural organisations, we contend that much can be learned about how to usefully frame commemorative activities from the unprecedented case of Blood Swept Lands and Seas of Red. © 2018 The Author(s).

For it is they, according to many official outlets–as the “next generation”–who have to bear the responsibility of carrying memory forward. The cornerstone of this activity is the UCL/Institute of Education (IoE) and Equity Travel First World War Centenary Battlefield Tours Programme (FWWCBTP), a national education initiative funded by the Department for Education (DfE) and Department for Communities and Local Government (DCLG). Between 2014 and 2019, the FWWCBTP will provide the opportunity for approximately 8–12,000 young people and teachers from every state-funded secondary school in England to visit battlefields on the Western Front. Based on research data gathered predominantly from participants in the spring 2015 tours, this article seeks to explore the perspective of the programme participants, rather than the programme creators or accompanying teachers, to understand how they responded to the UK government’s unprecedented attempt to engage young people in the history of the First World War via the vehicle of battlefield tourism. It explores possible tensions within the blending of education and remembrance, arguing that despite laudable intentions to encourage critical thinking about the First World War, for pupil participants the tour experience predominately emphasises particular narratives of “British” remembrance shaped around sacrifice, duty and loyalty. © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","battlefield tourism; centenary; education; First World War; remembrance; Youth",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Anderson, B., (1991) Imagined communities: Reflections on the origins and spread of nationalism, , London: Verso; Ashplant, T.G., Dawson, G., Roper, M., (2000) The politics of war memory and commemoration, , London: Routledge, &, (Eds; Baldwin, F., Sharpley, R., Battlefield tourism: Bringing organised violence back to life (2009) The darker side of travel: The theory and practice of dark tourism, pp. 186-206. , Sharpley R., Stone P.R., (eds), Bristol: Channel View, &,.

So it needs to be abandoned and re-thought, but on what basis? This paper analyses the potential for cultural work to encourage alternative visions of the “good life”, in particular, how it might encourage a kind of “sustainable prosperity” wherein human flourishing is not linked to high levels of material consumption but rather the capabilities to engage with cultural and creative practices and communities. We critically explore these ideas in three locations: a London borough, a deindustrialised city in England’s midlands and a rural town on the Welsh/English border. Across these diverse landscapes and socio-economic contexts, we look at different versions of the good life and at the possibilities and constraints of cultural activity as a way of achieving kinds of sustainable prosperity. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","cultural policy; cultural work; Sustainable prosperity",,,,,,"Economic and Social Research Council, ESRC: ES/M010163/1","This work was supported by the ESRC [grant number ES/M010163/1].",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Baekar, G., (2002) “Beyond garrets and silos”: Concepts, trends and developments in cultural planning, , Toronto: Municipal Cultural Planning Project; Balch, O., (2016) Under the tump, , London: Faber & Faber; Banks, M., (2017) Creative justice: Cultural industries, work and inequality, , London: Rowman & Littlefield; Bazalgette, P., (2017) Independent review of the creative industries, , London: DCMS; Butler, T., Lees, L., Super-gentrification in Barnsbury, London: Globalization and gentrifying global elites at the neighbourhood level (2006) Transactions of the Institute of British Geographers, 31 (4), pp. 467-487; Couch, C., Dennemann, A., Urban regeneration and sustainable development in Britain.

Elinor Ostrom [(1990/2012). Governing the commons. Cambridge University Press] challenged Hardin’s “The tragedy of the commons” [(1968). Science, 162(3859), 1243–1248] demonstrating that the governance of common pool resources is not always destined to failure. Ostrom’s analysis was initially applied to the management of shared natural resources; however, over time the term “commons” has also been used to describe non-tangible resources, specifically knowledge. Can Ostrom’s theory of the commons inform artistic practice? This article investigates some challenges presented by these research questions and their implications for cultural policy. In order to provide an empirical ground for the discussion of this topic, this paper will analyse the case studies of two cultural spaces in Italy, Teatro Valle (Rome) and Asilo Filangieri (Naples), which were occupied by groups of cultural professionals and managed as commons between 2011 and 2016; the outcomes of these occupations indicate possible ways to develop a commons-oriented approach to culture. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Asilo Filangieri; Commons; occupied cultural spaces; Ostrom’s law; Teatro Valle Occupato",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Bailey, S., Marcucci, M.E., Legalizing the occupation: The Teatro Valle as a cultural commons (2013) South Atlantic Quarterly, 112 (2), pp. 396-405; Bain, A., Mclean, H., The artistic precariat (2012) Cambridge Journal of Regions, Economy and Society, 2013 (6), pp. 93-111; Bollier, D., Helfrich, S., (2015) Patterns of commoning, , Amherst: The Commons Strategies Group; Botta, M., Heritage and city commons (2016) The city as commons: A policy reader, pp. 26-31. , Ramos J.M., (ed), Melbourne: Commons Transition Coalition [e-Book],.

The role and mission of modern zoos have evolved, with the conservation of world’s remaining biodiversity now being their major purpose. They seek to aid biodiversity through a combination of public education, in situ and ex situ conservation programmes, and applied scientific research. Directly relevant to this paper, they are also institutions that actively recruit, attract and utilise volunteers. However, the impacts of volunteering in zoos and aquariums, on the volunteers themselves, are under-researched. Here we show that, in a survey of more than 500 volunteers at 19 different zoological collections in the UK, zoo volunteers report positive impacts, specifically in relation to increases in their human and social capital. We also found that these benefits were more pronounced in younger volunteers, and with those volunteers who received more initial training. We conclude that while volunteering in UK zoos correlates with significant personal benefits to individuals, zoos could aim higher and should seek to do more to maximise the positive effects of connecting volunteers with the wildlife and nature found in zoo settings, as well as tailoring their volunteer training programmes for different age groups. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","human capital; impact; social capital; UK; Volunteering; zoos",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Aked, J., Marks, N., Cordon, C., Thompson, S., (2008) Five ways to wellbeing: A report presented to the foresight project on communicating the evidence base for improving people’s well-being, , London: Centre for Wellbeing, NEF; Bennett, N.J., Roth, R., Klain, S.C., Chan, K., Christie, P., Clark, D.A., Wyborn, C., Conservation social science: Understanding and integrating human dimensions to improve conservation (2017) Biological Conservation, 205, pp. 93-108; (2017), https://biaza.org.uk/our-association; Bixler, R.D., Joseph, S.L., Searles, V.M., Volunteers as products of a zoo conservation education program (2014) The Journal of Environmental Education, 45 (1), pp. 57-73; Bragg, R., Wood, C., Barton, J., Pretty, J., (2015) Wellbeing benefits from natural environments rich in wildlife.

Culture Counts, an evaluation system and digital platform, compiles data from standardised evaluation surveys of different stakeholder groups–organisations, audiences, critics, funders and peers–and provides the means to compare and triangulate data in an accessible format. As a result, it claims to provide a more effective, democratic tool for quality measurement of art, which demonstrates the public value of funding [Department of Culture and the Arts, & Knell, J. (2014). Public value measurement framework: Measuring the quality of the arts. Perth: Department of Culture and the Arts.]. Through qualitative research with two consortia of organisations involved in Culture Counts pilot projects in Manchester, England and Victoria, Australia, we explore these claims, comparing the reception and promotion of the system in both countries and considering its potential incorporation into policy assessment frameworks and adoption within arts organisations’ existing evaluation capacities. © 2017 The Author(s).

Since artistic success is defined by individual talent, or merit, the CCIs should be one sector that is especially open to, and appreciative of, social diversity in terms of race, class, cultural group and gender. However, as expected, recent studies in both the UK and the US have revealed that employment in the CCIs is heavily dominated by the middle classes, and is not as diverse in terms of other characteristics. Since the advent of democracy in South Africa in 1994, transformation of firm ownership, previously dominated by white people, to include more black, coloured and Indian/Asian-origin South Africans, has been an important part of achieving greater economic equality and social cohesion, as well as being more representative of the cultures of the majority of the population. Using data from a survey of 2400 CCIs firms in South Africa, this paper examines the extent to which the CCIs in South Africa have transformed in terms of ownership and employment. Comparisons are also made across the six UNESCO [(2009). Framework for cultural statistics. UNESCO Institute for Statistics. Retrieved from http://www.uis.unesco.org/culture/Pages/framework-cultural-statistics.aspx] “Cultural Domains” in terms of ownership, average monthly turnover and the number of full-time, part-time and contract employees. Results show some diversity in the industry, but significant differences between the Domains. Statistical analysis demonstrates that CCI funding policy in South Africa is sensitive to advancing the transformation agenda in that more transformed firms were shown to be more likely to have received some form of government grant as part of their income. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Cultural and creative industries; cultural domains; employment; ownership",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"(2009) Research into the impact of arts, culture and creative industries on Africa’s economy: Nigeria, , http://www.uis.unesco.org/culture/Documents/nigeria-pilot-research-impact-study-culture-industries-2009.pdf, Retrieved from; (2008) The creative industries in South Africa: Sector report (2008), , http://www.labour.gov.za/DOL/downloads/documents/research-documents/Creative%20Industries_DoL_Report.pdf, Commissioned by the Department of Labour.

Since the Republic’s economic collapse in 2008 and the recession, museums have weathered significant shifts in governance and board structures, and drastic cutbacks that have affected programmes, staffing, and provision across the island. Yet, until recently we have not had an accurate picture of the “state of play” for Irish museums, hampering efforts to prioritise actions for museum support organisations, and preventing individual institutions to develop their own plans of advancement benchmarked against national data. Consequently, there has been a significant knowledge gap concerning the current state of Irish museums, stretching beyond the anecdotal, and bridging the border between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland. This essay addresses the major findings of the Irish Museums Survey 2016, contextualised within the landscape of recent research on museums in the Republic and the North, and existing research infrastructures. In reviewing forms of museum provision and policy in both jurisdictions, it argues that the haphazard nature of data collection and the worrying findings of some aspects of the 2016 Survey require the enhancement of an all-island research culture, audit of national collections and institutions, and development of improved strategic planning for museums. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","heritage; Ireland; museums; Northern Ireland; recession",,,,,,"Irish Research Council","This work was supported by Irish Research Council [New Foundations?Engaging Civic Society].",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Atkinson, R., (2012), https://www.museumsassociation.org/museums-journal/news/11072012-controversy-over-creationism-at-giants-causeway, July, Creationism controversy at Giant’s Causeway.

However, this transition has been neither linear nor straightforward. Divisions, both physical and symbolic, reflecting collective identities and ‘otherness’, remain resistant to change and continue to foster sectarianism, mistrust and outbreaks of violence. Despite some positive change, not least of which is the absence of sustained violence, the majority of neighbourhoods and schools remain either Protestant or Catholic. Drawing on data from the Young Life and Times (YLT) survey, an annual attitudinal survey of 16-year-olds in Northern Ireland that has been running since 2003, this article explores what young people's perspectives reveal about the complexities and the challenges involved in transitioning to a more shared society. Where relevant and possible, their attitudes are compared with those expressed by adults in the annual Northern Ireland Life and Times (NILT) survey. A primary focus on tracking teenagers' attitudes is important for a number of reasons. While often regarded as a ‘post-conflict’ generation, segregation and polarisation remain features of teenagers' everyday lives and the political landscape. Children and young people are one of the four key strategic priorities in the latest government strategies to build united communities and achieve change and are embedded in the Programme for Government 2016–2021. If these government commitments are to be realised, the voices of young people must become central rather than peripheral. It is important, therefore, that their opinions are not only sought, but also interrogated and fed into policy. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","belonging; culture; good relations; identity; Northern Ireland; Teenagers",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Amin, A., Ethnicity and the multicultural city: Living with diversity (2002) Environment and Planning A, 34, pp. 959-980; Breen-Smyth, M., Injured and disabled casualties of the Northern Ireland conflict: Issues in immediate and long-term treatment, care and support (2013) Medicine, Conflict and Survival, 29, pp. 244-266; Browne, B., Dwyer, C., Navigating risk: Understanding the impact of conflict on children and young people in Northern Ireland (2014) Studies in Conflict and Terrorism, 37 (9), pp. 792-805; Byrne, J., Cathy Gormley-Heenan, C., Morrow, D., Sturgeon, B., (2015) Public attitudes to peace walls 2015 survey results, , Jordanstown: Ulster University; Coulter, C., (1999) Contemporary Northern Irish Society, , London: Pluto Press; Cummings, M.E., Merrilees, C.E., Schermerhorn, A.C., Goekemorey, M.C., Shirlow, P., Cairns, E., Longtitudinal pathways between violence and child adjustment: The role of emotional security and community in Northern Ireland (2011) Journal of Abnormal Child Psychology, 39, pp. 213-224; Devine, P., Northern Ireland life and times survey: Monitoring change in diverse societies (2014) Shared Space, 18, pp. 24-32. , http://www.community-relations.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Northern-Ireland-Life-and-Times-Survey-Monitoring-Change-in-Diverse-Societies-.pdf, Retrieved from; Devine, P., Robinson, G., From survey to policy: Community relations in Northern Ireland (2014) Sociological Research Online, 19. , http://www.socresonline.org.uk/19/1/27.html, Retrieved from; Diez, T., Hayward, K., Reconfiguring spaces of conflict: Northern Ireland and the impact of European integration (2008) Space and Polity, 12, pp. 47-62; Dixon, P., The politics of conflict: A constructivist critique of consociational and civil society theories (2012) Nations and Nationalism, 18, pp. 98-121; Hayes, B., McAlister, I., (2013) Conflict to peace.

What route do they take from inception to implementation and what criteria are used to evaluate one set of proposals against another? This paper examines the development of the Creative Work Fellowship policy proposal in Limerick, tracing the origins of the idea, itself a contended and negotiated object, from discussions between academics and policy-makers through to scoping, pitching and scaling the policy to its eventual users. This policy idea was designed during the Intelligence Unit (IU) commissioned by Limerick2020 as part of the city’s bid to become European Capital of Culture in 2020. The IU took the form of a policy think-tank, tasked with generating insights, ideas and policy proposals into the place of culture within Limerick city and region. The IU structure created a set of actors and an epistemic community capable of both generating and using ideas effectively, chiefly through two mechanisms. The first involved a robust critique and rebuilding process that every element of the policy was exposed to; the second involved feedback from interested parties at specific stages in the process. This created a series of “policy entrepreneurs” capable of taking a fully costed and modelled policy suggestion to government. The findings presented in the paper include an analysis of the collaborative nature of this policy development process, Based on this framework, we also consider the role of the European City of Culture bid process as catalyst for policy development in a regional context, and present findings on this subject. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","creative careers; cultural policy; European capital of culture; interdisciplinary research; policy design; social policy",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Akrich, M., Callon, M., Latour, B., Monaghan, A., The key to success in innovation part I: The art of interessement (2002) International Journal of Innovation Management, 6, pp. 187-206; (2005), http://www.artscouncil.ie/uploadedFiles/Main_Site/Content/Research_and_Publications/Theatre/theatre_socio_exec_summary.pdf, Socio-economic conditions of theatre practitioners in Ireland (Report).

In July 2013, a Coalition government was elected, Senator George Brandis became Minister for the Arts, and the policy was dumped. With it went cross-party consensus about funding rationales and measurement strategies, with disastrous consequences for the cultural sector. This cautionary tale of gaffes, pay-back and abrupt changes of direction, highlights the fragility of policy memory that condemns artists and arts managers to a never-ending reinvention of the evidentiary wheel. Our paper examines the problem of collective understanding (“world”) in cultural policy-making in Australia, exacerbated not only by the short-term electoral cycles which undermine long-term cultural outcome timescales, but by a fixation on what Hannah Arendt calls “the peculiar and ingenious replacement of common sense with strict logicality”. Evidence of value is only meaningful when it occurs in a policy memory that can fully avow it and respond in appropriate ways. Measurement methods are over-determined by epistemology and by experience. We argue that the balance between these determinants of effective cultural policy-making has been lost. An emphasis on numerical data–especially economic data–has forced arguments for culture into a decontextualised register of quantitative proof. Recent events in Australia suggest that different, more direct ways of engaging with cultural policy-making are required for the problem of collective understanding to be successfully assayed. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","arts funding; Australian cultural policy; George Brandis; policy memory; policy world",,,,,,"Australian Research Council, ARC: LP140100802","This work was supported by Australian Research Council (LP140100802).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Anderson, E., (1993) Value in ethics and economics, , Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press; Andrews, J., (1988), Subsidy for the performing arts in Australia, 1942–1970 (unpublished PhD dissertation).

This is seen by some to present greater commercial opportunities for film-making from countries marginalised by previous distribution networks, and to foster a more globally diverse and inclusive film-viewing culture, with particular benefits for diasporic populations. Others, however, have pointed to the way in which audiences’ engagement with film online may be constrained by the economics and technology of online distribution and cultural competencies rooted in social stratification. These factors may limit how and what audiences watch, extending beyond issues of physical access to those of cultural access. As such, they raise questions regarding the demographic composition of the audience for online methods of film distribution and different types of international film. We lack sufficient understanding of these issues, however, due to the limited emphasis upon socio-demographic variables in existing academic research into online film consumption, and the limited consideration of particular film content in relevant market research. This article uses original audience research to interrogate the extent to which online distribution is able to connect audiences to a diversity of international film in comparison to other methods of distribution. It also considers some of the socio-demographic characteristics of the audiences for different methods of distribution and types of international film. In doing so, the article grants us a clearer understanding of the degree to which online film distribution fosters diversity and inclusivity through the connections it facilitates between audiences and content. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","cultural diversity; film audiences; Film distribution; international film; social inclusivity; video-on-demand",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Aigrain, P., (2012) Sharing: Culture and the economy in the internet age, , Amsterdam: Amsterdam University Press; Albornoz, L.A., (2016), http://www.uis.unesco.org/culture/Documents/ip29-diversity-film-data-2016-en.pdf, Diversity and the film industry: An analysis of the 2014 UIS Survey on Feature Film Statistics.

As Kuhlke, Schramme, and Kooyman [(2015). Introduction. Creating cultural capital: Cultural entrepreneurship in theory, pedagogy and practice. Delft: Eburon] note, “In Europe, courses began to emerge in the late 1980s and early 1990s … primarily providing an established business school education with an industry-specific focus on the new and emerging creative economy.” Conversely, the development of “arts entrepreneurship” courses and programmes in the US have been driven as much or more from interest within arts disciplines or even from within the career services units of arts conservatories as a means toward supporting artist self-sufficiency and career self-management. This paper looks at the conceptual development of “arts entrepreneurship” in the US as differentiated from “cultural entrepreneurship” in Europe and elsewhere. Its intention is to uncover where the two strands of education (and research) are the same, and where they are different.

Policy developments that establish sets of justifications and rationales that have nothing to do with the cultural content of the policy concerned, but which arise from a deliberate realignment of policy frameworks, establish a form of hyperinstrumentalism. With hyperinstrumentalism the focus on outcomes and the ends of policy means that cultural policy is only as important as the ends to which it is directed. As such, hyperinstrumentalisation demonstrates the consequences for the sector of conditions where claims about the value of culture are irrelevant to political actors. The paper questions whether sense can be made of this shift as a coherent and strategic political choice, rather than as a simple assault on culture. The case of Northern Ireland’s Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure is used to illustrate this. The authors question whether hyperinstrumentalism undermines the justification for an autonomous domain of cultural policy. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Cultural policy; hyperinstrumentalism; instrumentalism; Northern Ireland",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Belfiore, E., Art as a means of alleviating social exclusion: Does it really work?

Here we approach the notion of space in two different but complementary ways. Our main focus is on geographical variations in participation, which we explore at the regional level in England. However, in order to do so, we begin by re-evaluating the nature of the cultural field itself and the way that this is arranged in social space. The issue of regional disparities in the funding of cultural activities and venues from the public purse has become a heated issue. Yet, in contrast to the avowedly regional focus of much cultural and creative industries policy following the advent of the first New Labour administration in 1997, issues of place have been largely overlooked in recent studies of cultural consumption, and therefore little is known about the spatial dynamics of participation practices. Using data from the UK government’s Taking Part Survey, we adopt a novel methodological approach, known as Multiple Factor Analysis, to re-examine and represent the English cultural field. Our findings reveal the hitherto underestimated importance of informal everyday cultural practices in configuring the sociology of lifestyles. Alongside and beyond the familiar North–South divide and London effect, they also indicate that the English cultural field is characterised by a complex regional geography. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","geography; lifestyle; Multiple Factor Analysis; Participation; region",,,,,,"Arts and Humanities Research Council, AHRC: AH/J005401/1","This work was supported by the Arts and Humanities Research Council through Connected Communities Large Project funding for ?Understanding Everyday Participation: Articulating Cultural Values?, 2012?2017 [AH/J005401/1].",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Agnew, J.A., (1987) Place and politics: The geographical mediation of state and society, , Boston, MA: Allen & Unwin; Bennett, T., Savage, M., Silva, E., Warde, A., Gayo-Cal, M., Wright, D., (2009) Culture, class, distinction, , London: Routledge; Bourdieu, P., (1984) Distinction: A social critique of the judgement of taste, , London: Routledge; Chapain, C., Comunian, R., Enabling and inhibiting the creative economy: The role of the local and regional dimensions in England (2010) Regional Studies, 44 (6), pp. 717-734; Chernilo, D., The critique of methodological nationalism: Theory and history (2006) Thesis Eleven, 106 (1), pp. 98-117; (2014), Equality and diversity within the arts and cultural sector.

In order to challenge this dominance, UEP sets out to explore the meanings and values people attach to their “everyday participation”, with the aim of re-evaluating current understandings of cultural participation and cultural value [Miles, A., & Gibson, L. (2016). Understanding everyday participation-articulating cultural values. Cultural Trends, 25(3), 151–157]. This article discusses UEP ethnographic research conducted within a charity shop in Manchester/ Salford. The charity shop is found to be a site fundamentally involved in the “cultural economy”, defined broadly to refer to the relations between the cultural and economic values of particular practices and institutions involved in cultural production and consumption. Existing research on consumption have understood the charity shop as a place of cultural consumption, for certain subcultures that make “clever” choices regarding their identities [Gregson, N., & Crewe, L. (2003). Second hand cultures. Oxford: Berg]. This article argues for an understanding of the charity shop as more than simply a place of consumption but as enmeshed within a set of relations between culture, economy and place which has effects in the social sphere. This research identifies a number of forms of participation, including consumption, but also extending to various production practices, and other forms of social interaction, which take place within and through the charity shop. We argue that these different types of participation are bound up in a positioning cultural system that categorises people, places and values within and beyond the sphere of the charity shop. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Charity shop; cultural consumption; cultural economy; cultural practice; cultural value; everyday participation",,,,,,"Arts and Humanities Research Council, AHRC: AH/J005401/1","We would like to thank the management and other participants at CH Charity for allowing Edwards to participate with them and for engaging with her over the three months she was a volunteer there.

Recent critiques have pointed to the ways in which the rural and peri-urban domains have been neglected in cultural policy as the by-product of a preoccupation with urban regeneration and the “creative city”. Working with conceptual frameworks developed by Raymond Williams and Charles Taylor, our research reveals the rich fabric of participation in this community, reflecting an historically rooted “common culture”, through which social tensions are mediated by a “village social imaginary”. This “residual” formation, which emphasises the importance of everyday culture to the constitution of the civic realm, suggests a much broader understanding of cultural value than is currently recognised in policy, but is currently under threat from generational change and social flux. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","clubs and institutions; community; cultural value; Participation; place; urban–rural",,,,,,"Creative Scotland

Given its setting, the case study examines the rural dimensions of participation and cultural value. In addition to understanding the meaning and value of performance-based participation taking place in shared communal spaces, including the parish hall and the high street, this article seeks to understand everyday participation as a fundamentally embodied and emplaced practice. Place is not simply a venue or site for performance (or any other type of) participation. Drawing on the place theory of Edward Casey, who follows the European school of phenomenology, it is argued that place is, rather, the fundamental ground of human experience: embodied subjects and places co-evolve in a dialogic process of inter-animation. The main question we ask is how rurality shapes participation and how participation re-produces material and imaginary rural spaces. A key characteristic of government funding of arts and culture in the UK is extreme inequality in the distribution of funds to the City of London compared to the rest of the UK. While the cultural ecosystems of all UK regions outside London are equally disadvantaged in this respect, economic and cultural development in the South West region exacerbates this unequal situation by focussing investment and service provision in urban hubs, leaving contrasting rural areas doubly disadvantaged. This case study argues that an idyll-ised rural imaginary re-produced in and through everyday participation is only compounded by government deficits. Furthermore, it asserts that cultural policy making concerned with the value of equality must adopt a co-ordinated approach that takes into account complex interdependencies of national, regional and local registers of place. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","cultural policy; cultural value; participation; performance; Place; rurality",,,,,,"Creative Scotland

This article looks at public parks as vernacular spaces for everyday participation, drawing on empirical research, including ethnographic fieldwork, household interviews and focus groups, and community engagement conducted for the Manchester-Salford ecosystem case study of the ‘Understanding Everyday Participation–Articulating Cultural Value’ (UEP) project [Miles & Gibson, 2016. Everyday participation and cultural value. Cultural Trends, 5(3), 151–157]. It considers narratives of participation [Miles, 2016. Telling tales of participation: Exploring the interplay of time and territory in cultural boundary work using participation narratives. Cultural Trends, 5, 182–193], which reveal how parks are valued and recognised as community assets and spaces for both tolerance and distinction, where different communities can meet, become visible, and perform shared and distinct cultural identities [Low et al., 2005. Rethinking Urban Parks, Public Space and Cultural Diversity. Austin: University of Texas Press]. It draws on the conceptual device of ‘the commons’, defined as a dynamic and collective resource that stands in tension with commodified and privatised space [Gidwani & Baviskar, 2011. Urban Commons Review of Urban Affairs: Economic & Political Weekly, Volume XLVI No. 50 December 10, 2011. http://www.epw.in/journal/2011/50/review-urban-affairs-review-issues-specials/urban-commons.html]., to explore how parks present opportunities for civic participation through contemporary processes of ‘commoning’ [Linebaugh, 2014. The Magna Carta Manifesto: Liberties and Commons for All. Berkeley: University of California Press]. I argue that parks are also subject to contemporary forms of enclosure through social exclusion and physical closure, which impact on the likely success of current policy imperatives for community asset transfer and alternative management models. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","community assets; cultural policy; everyday participation; Parks; the commons",,,,,,"Creative Scotland

(2016). Everyday participation and cultural value. Cultural Trends, 25(3), 151–157]. This paper on the geography of library use is an early presentation of ongoing research which seeks to understand the impact of geography and asset “attractiveness” on particular kinds of cultural participation. Many studies have focused on traditional “push” factors to participation, understanding attendance and participation in their various forms through individual- and household-level demographic and socio-economic characteristics [e.g. Bennett, T., Savage, M., Silva, E., Warde, A., Gayo, M., & Wright, D. (2009). Culture, class, distinction. London: Routledge]. However, a number of recent studies have also revealed the significant effects of supply and proximity on participation [Brook, O. (2013). Reframing models of arts attendance: Understanding the role of access to a venue. The case of opera in London. Cultural Trends, 22(2), 97–107; Brook, O. (2016). Spatial equity and cultural participation: How access influences attendance at museums and galleries in London. 25(1), 12–34; Widdop, P., & Cutts, D. (2012). Impact of place on museum participation. Cultural Trends, 21(1), 47–66; Hooper-Greenhill, E., Phillips, M., & Woodham, A. (2009). Museums, schools and geographies of cultural value. Cultural Trends, 18(2), 149–183]. In this paper, our approach to the geography of cultural participation focuses on the role of what we are terming “pull factors” to participation at specific locales over others. Many forms of participation in socio-cultural activities involve a level of spatial decision-making, weighing up factors relating to the destination(s), and the time and effort of getting there. How much do these “pull factors” impact on participation, and are they quantifiable? In order to understand if these spatial considerations are an explanatory factor in explaining the socio-demography of library use, we have applied the urban planning concept of trip-chaining and a geographically defined categorisation of asset attractiveness [O’Reilly, N., Berger, I. E., Hernandez, T., Parent, M. M., & Seguin, B. (2015). Urban sportscapes: An environmental deterministic perspective on the management of youth sport participation. Sport Management Review, 18, 291–307.; Thill, J.-C., & Thomas, I. (1987). Toward conceptualizing trip-chaining behavior: A review. Geographical Analysis, 19, 1–17] to reveal the extent to which a library visit is linked to other everyday activities.

Three broad categories of societal benefit are posited, namely identity and social cohesion, experimental/innovative work and economic spill-over effects. The goals/objectives of the key funding agencies in Australia, England, Ireland and New Zealand are then examined, with a view to ascertaining to what extent they map on to societal benefits. The goal of equal access for all to the arts in particular is questioned. The paper concludes by addressing the issue of how evidence can, it at all, be provided for the existence of societal benefits from public funding of the arts. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","equal access; funding agencies; Public funding; societal outcomes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Allan, C., Grimes, A., Kerr, S., (2013) Value and culture: An economic framework, , Wellington: Ministry for Culture and Heritage; Allesandro, A., Bakhshi, H., Mitchell, S., Smithies, R., (2013) Publicly-funded arts as an R&D lab for the creative industries: A survey of theatre careers in the UK, , London: Arts Council of England and Nesta; (2013), http://rracelb01.aws.rroom.net/sites/default/files/download-file/Great_art_and_culture_for_everyone.pdf, Great art and culture for everyone 2010-2020: 10-year strategic review (2nd ed.).

We perform a unique historic analysis of the visibility of collections in a museum of ethnographic collections and compare 100 years of onsite visits to 5 years online visits. We find two main results: first, access to collections increased substantially online. From a selection of objects available both onsite and online, access grew from an average of 156,000 onsite visits per year to over 1.5 million views online per year. Onsite, the museum received 15.5 million visits in a span of a century while online, collections were viewed 7.9 million times in only the last 5 years. Second, we find a difference in consumer preference for type of object, favouring 3D onsite and 2D online (photographs of objects, particularly when showing them being used).

This multidisciplinary project brings together the arts and humanities with the social sciences with their different epistemological philosophies and subsequent understandings of research methods. The main objective was to determine how visual arts activities may change, sustain and catalyse community cultures, beliefs, attitudes and behaviours to create dementia-friendly communities. This project involves 6 different UK universities, 14 researchers, 10 formal partners, 7 project artists, 3 research artists and a large number of civil society organisations. The analysis presents a series of themes that have been identified as influencing the approach taken to develop methods which aimed to speak to different audiences in the social sciences, arts and humanities, policy/practice and public domains. It is concluded that a research project of this type needs to embrace a wide variety of epistemological positions if it is to successfully achieve its objectives. This paper contributes to knowledge about how the methodology of large-scale multidisciplinary projects may be constructed which will be of value to those building research consortia across different universities and between universities and community partners. © 2016 The Author(s).

This paper tries to navigate a third route, which sees policy relevance and influence as a legitimate goal of critical research, without accepting the pressures and restrictions of arts advocacy and lobbying. This is accomplished by exploring the journey “into the real world” of preliminary findings emerging from the Understanding Everyday Participation project: a segmentation exercise based on Taking Part data which showed that the wealthiest, better educated and least ethnically diverse 8% of the English population are the most engaged in culture. This data fed into the consultation and evidence gathering process of the Warwick Commission on the Future of Cultural Value, and was eventually cited in its final report Enriching Britain. The paper charts the increasing prominence of “the 8%” statistic in English cultural policy debates and argues that, despite the researchers' limited control over the use/misuse of their data, policy influence is nonetheless a realistic objective if understood as “conceptual influence”. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","access; arts policy; cultural consumption; Cultural participation; research impact",,,,,,"Arts and Humanities Research Council, AHRC: AH/J005401/1","This work was supported by the AHRC [grant number AH/J005401/1].",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Abraham, N., Busby, S., (2015), Celebrating success.

More recently, “leading edge” cultural practice and programmes have been based on the notion that benefit from such participation occurs via the facilitation of the active agency of participants through the making of their own meanings through co-curation and co-creation. Enlistment and involvement in, what we have termed “facilitated participation”, is, in Nikolas Rose’s terms, a tool of “advanced liberalism” whereby the governance of individuals operates on the basis of the governance of their “freedom”, through making them self-governing subjects [Rose, N. (1999). Powers of freedom: Reframing political thought. Cambridge University Press]. In the particular case of young people living in care, we have found that the facilitation of their agency through cultural programmes is limited by an assumption that such groups’ everyday cultural choices lack value and to facilitate them (and thereby their agency) would involve risk. Through a discussion of research undertaken with this group, this paper will explore how different domains of participation are understood by both the facilitators and the facilitated. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","advanced liberalism; agency; Cultural value; participation; risk; young people in care",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Batsleer, J., Voices from an edge.

Existing work that investigates state-supported culture implies often large groups of people “not currently engaged” in culture. The scope of this survey allows us to identify not only what else those “highly engaged” are doing, but also whether those “not currently engaged” are active elsewhere. Using this survey, I use hierarchical cluster analysis to identify relationships between variables, and kmeans cluster analysis to identify patterns of participation. The analysis suggests, consistent with other work, that about 8.7% of the English population is highly engaged with state-supported forms of culture, and that this fraction is particularly well-off, well-educated, and white. Over half of the population has fairly low levels of engagement with state-supported culture but is nonetheless busy with everyday culture and leisure activities such as pubs, darts, and gardening. Only about 11% of the population is detached from mainstream pastimes and social events outside of television. The results challenge the basis of policies seeking to manage cultural and leisure participation: current policies aimed at increasing participation in state-sanctioned activities are likely to target those with already busy cultural lives. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","cluster analysis; cultural policy; participation; Taking Part",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"(2008) Arts-based segmentation of English adults: Technical note, , London: Author; (2011) Arts-based segmentation of English adults: Technical note, , London: Author; Bennett, T., Savage, M., Silva, E., Warde, A., Gayo-Cal, M., Wright, D., (2009) Culture, class, distinction, , London: Routledge; Bourdieu, P., (1984) Distinction: A social critique of the judgment of taste, , London: Routledge; Bunting, C., Chan, T.W., Goldthorpe, J.H., Keaney, E., Oskala, A., (2008) From indifference to enthusiasm: Patterns of arts attendance in England, , London: Arts Council England; Calinski, T., Harabasz, J., A dendrite method for cluster analysis (1974) Communications in Statistics – Theory and Methods, 3 (1), pp. 1-27; Chan, T.W., Goldthorpe, J.H., The social stratification of theatre, dance and cinema attendance (2005) Cultural Trends, 14, pp. 193-212; Chan, T.W., Goldthorpe, J.H., Class and status: The conceptual distinction and its empirical relevance (2007) American Sociological Review, 72, pp. 512-532; Chan, T.W., Goldthorpe, J.H., Social status and newspaper readership (2007) American Journal of Sociology, 112, pp. 1095-1134; Chan, T.W., Goldthorpe, J.H., Social stratification and cultural consumption: The visual arts in England (2007) Poetics, 35, pp. 168-190; Chan, T.W., Goldthorpe, J.H., Social stratification and cultural consumption: Music in England (2007) European Sociological Review, 23, pp. 1-19; Cooper, A., The drivers, impact and value of case: A short history from the inside (2012) Cultural Trends, 21 (4), pp. 281-289; Crossick, G., Kaszynska, P., Under construction: Towards a framework for cultural value (2014) Cultural Trends, 23 (2), pp. 120-131; (2006) Taking part: The national survey of culture, leisure and sport, 2005–2006; adult and child data[computer file], , http://dx.doi.org/10.5255/UKDA-SN-5717-1, 2nd ed., Colchester: UK Data Archive [distributor], September 2010.

Yet, the preferred method of understanding practice variation in the cultural field – the analysis of cross-sectional survey data focused on established tastes and activities – reveals little of the broader nature, dynamics or significance of participation in people’s daily lives. In this paper, I explore the potential of participation narratives for re-scoping the field of cultural participation. These accounts foreground the multiplicity of participation, its embeddedness in everyday concerns, institutions and relationships, and the interplay of time and space in the demarcation of the field by class and gender. As well as highlighting the limitations of theoretical models that focus on participation through the lens of cultural practices funded by the State, they suggest that articulations of cultural value in policy need to take more account of the personal histories, social relations and local contexts of participation. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","age; class; cultural capital; Everyday participation; gender; place",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Belfiore, E., Bennett, O., (2008) The social impact of the arts: An intellectual history, , Basingstoke: Palgrave; Bennett, T., Culture, choice, necessity: A political critique of Bourdieu’s aesthetic (2011) Poetics, 39, pp. 530-546; Bennett, T., Savage, M., Silva, E., Warde, A., Gayo-Cal, M., Wright, D., (2009) Culture, class, distinction, , London: Routledge; (1984), Bourdieu, P., Distinction: A social critique of the judgement of taste.

It develops a preliminary account of cultural ecology as a systematic approach to producing impact in the creative economy. It argues that such an approach is a powerful way to aggregate micro-businesses and small and medium sized enterprises in a meaningful network of new relationships. The paper uses social network analysis software to begin to visualise the pattern of relationships that constitute the ecosystem.

Frayling’s [1994. Research in art and design. Royal College of Art Research Papers, 1(1), 1993/4] distinctions between research into, through, and as (for) practice are expanded to explore overlaps between these approaches. I argue for the need to understand the nuances of different epistemologies and ontologies that underpin diverse disciplinary approaches to practice-research. This is done through an analysis of a selection of Arts and Humanities Research Council (AHRC)-funded projects to find out how they are using and/or embedding practice in the research process. The resulting Colour Wheel of Practice-Research illustrates a spectrum of positions of practice in relation to research, suggesting existing research paradigms are bursting at the seams and that the “disciplinary matrix” of practice might offers other ways of knowing. The reason I have chosen to focus primarily on AHRC-funded projects is because it explicitly states its support of “practice-led research” and that it “remains dedicated to this area of research”. This article aims to add to knowledge of how and why practice-research is of continuing interest to research councils, universities, and those identifying as practice-based/led researchers. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","AHRC; cultural value; mixed methods; Practice-based/led research; research paradigms",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"http://www.ahrc.ac.uk/documents/project-reports-and-reviews/cultural-value-project-project-summaries/#KRumbold, Cultural value project: Project summaries.

This stands in stark contrast to dominant policy narratives of the CCIs as meritocratic. Until now this debate has been clouded by a relative paucity of data on class origins. This paper draws on new social origin data from the 2014 Labour Force Survey to provide the first large-scale, representative study of the class composition of Britain’s creative workforce. The analysis demonstrates that CCIs show significant variation in their individual “openness”, although there is a general under-representation of those from working-class origins across the sector. This under-representation is especially pronounced in publishing and music, in contrast to, for example, craft. Moreover, even when those from working-class backgrounds enter certain CCIs, they face a “class origin pay gap” compared to those from privileged backgrounds. The paper discusses how class inequalities, as well as those related to gender and ethnicity, between individual CCIs point to occupational subcultures that resist aggregation into the Department for Culture, Media and Sport’s broader category of CCIs. The paper concludes by suggesting the importance of disaggregating CCIs and rethinking the definition and boundaries of CCIs as a meaningful category. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Creative industries; creative labour; creative work; Labour Force Survey; meritocracy; pay Gap",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Allen, K., ‘What do you need to make it as a woman in this industry?

The article argues that arts bodies have been slower than some business sectors to enter the data sphere and to contribute to the key debates even though many arts organisations have been developing data systems as a means of responding to the demands of funding bodies for more concrete measurement of impact. The article tests this hypothesis by examining the outcomes of a major NESTA/ACE/AHRC-funded project which applied ethnographic method to analyse the use of data by three major arts bodies operating in London, a project which built on the arguments forwarded in a previous NESTA document, Counting what counts (NESTA 2013). The project, managed by the Audience Agency, on which the present author was principal researcher, was delivered over 12 months from August 2014 to August 2015. The article outlines the methodology, and highlights the emergence of a new ethnographic form, “thick data” grounded in data theory and practice. This form is then used to illuminate some of the practices used by large arts organisations to handle audience data, and to develop inclusive and comprehensive future programming strategies. A range of embedded practices are discussed and examined illustrating the various strategies used by the partner organisations to address key data issues and problems. From this detailed analysis, the article then outlines a number of models for the organisation of data within arts institutions. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Big Data; culture; ethnography; symbolic creativity; technology; Thick data",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Lilley, A., Moore, P., (2013) Counting what counts, , London: NESTA/Arts Council England; Madsbjerg, C., Rasmussen, M., (2014), http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702304256404579449254114659882, The power of big data in the Wall Street Journal.

The neighbourhood effects literature identifies how where people live shapes their lives, including their participation in various activities, but this has not been applied to cultural participation. Sociological theory explores the importance of social stratification of cultural consumption, but has largely ignored the role of place. In this paper sociological explanations of cultural participation are extended to incorporate the influence of access to cultural infrastructure. An innovative accessibility index for museums and galleries in London, using online searches to weight their attraction, is linked to the Taking Part Survey, and used to predict attendance. Alongside social stratification, significant neighbourhood characteristics are identified, including, importantly, access to museums and galleries. Improved access has a strong positive relationship with attendance, which varies according to qualifications and ethnic group: those with degrees are most likely to attend, but the relationship with access also operates for those with fewer qualifications, who according to traditional explanations have little disposition to attend. The implications of the substantial spatial inequity in investment in museums and galleries are discussed. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.","accessibility; Cultural participation; museums attendance; spatial equity",,,,,,"Economic and Social Research Council, ESRC: RES-187-24-0014",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Apparicio, P., Abdelmajid, M., Riva, M., Shearmur, R., Comparing alternative approaches to measuring the geographical accessibility of urban health services: Distance types and aggregation-error issues (2008) International Journal of Health Geographics, 7, p. 7; (2011) Accreditation scheme for museums and galleries in the United Kingdom: Accreditation standard, , London: Author; (2012), http://www.alva.org.uk/details.cfm?p=598, Visitor Statistics.

Rationales for such intervention generally reflect the policy and political regime operating in different eras, but widening participation, increasing access and making the subsidised arts more inclusive have been perennial concerns. On the other hand, culture has also been the subject of a supply-led approach to facility provision, whether local amenity-based (“Every Town Should Have One” – Lane, 1979. Arts centres – every town should have one. London: Paul Elek), civic centre or flagship, and this has also mirrored periodic growth in investment through various capital for the arts, municipal expansion, urban regeneration, European regional development and lottery programmes. Research into participation has consequently taken a macro, sociological, “class distinction” approach, including longitudinal national surveys such as Taking Part, Target Group Index, Active People and Time Use Surveys, whilst actual provision is dealt with at the micro, amenity level in terms of its impact and catchment. This article therefore considers how this situation has evolved and the implications for cultural policy, planning and research by critiquing successive surveys of arts attendance and participation and associated arts policy initiatives, including the importance of local facilities such as arts centres, cinemas and libraries. A focus on cultural mapping approaches to accessible cultural amenities reveals important evidence for bridging the divide between cultural participation and provision. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.","accessibility; Arts participation; cultural mapping",,,,,,"Arts and Humanities Research Council, AHRC: AH/K00414X/1

However, these themes have rarely overlapped in either policy thinking or academic research, and so this article focuses on the relationship between place, education and professional aspirations for young people. Using the findings from qualitative interviews with media studies students within higher education (HE), this article analyses how the perceived attributes of some locations may provide industry credibility and the promise of enhanced professional mobility. It examines the tangible and symbolic value of place within young people's career development in the creative industries. The findings highlight how the links between place and education can influence the professional process, and how place shapes young people's perceptions of and opportunities for work in the creative industries. Finally, this research emphasises how current theories on creative industries policy and HE provision need to be extended to take greater account of the ways in which the attributes of localities can be used as a catalyst for individual professionalism amongst young people, and the ways in which certain places (mainly rural) may be disadvantaged in the current policy trajectory. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.","creative work; cultural policy; higher education; place; professionalism; urban; young people",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Allen, K., Hollingworth, S., ‘Sticky subjects’ or ‘cosmopolitan creatives’?

Employing data from the Netherlands’ Longitudinal Lifecourse Study 2010 we explored the extent to which educational attainment, national identification and social integration explain inequality in cultural participation among Turkish and Moroccan immigrants, and to what extent the effect of education was moderated by aspects of social identification and integration. Our results indicate that Turks and Moroccans, who identify more with the Netherlands and have a social network that includes larger numbers of Dutch and higher educated friends, are more active in the cultural realm. Most interestingly, we found that strong identification with Dutch society actually moderates the relationship between an immigrants’ educational attainment and their cultural participation: that is, highly educated people of Turkish and Moroccan descent, who strongly identify with the Netherlands, participated more in highbrow culture than their highly educated counterparts who identified less with the Netherlands. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.","ethnic differentiation; highbrow cultural participation; identification; integration; migrants; social networks",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Bekhuis, H., Lubbers, M., Recente migranten en hun culturele oriëntatie op Nederlanden het land van herkomst [Recent migrants and their cultural orientation towards the Netherlands and their origin country] (2013) Tijdschrift voor Sociologie, 34 (3-4), pp. 250-269; Berry, J.W., Acculturation as varieties of adaptation (1980) Acculturation: Theory, models and some new findings, pp. 9-25. , Padilla A., (ed), Boulder, CO: Westview; Berry, J.W., Immigration, acculturation, and adaption (1997) Applied Psychology: An International Review, 46 (1), pp. 5-68; Bourdieu, P., (1984) Distinction: A social critique of the judgement of taste, , London: Routledge and Kegan; Bussemaker, J., (2013) Cultuur beweegt: De betekenis van cultuur in een veranderende samenleving [Culture moves: The meaning of culture in a changing society] (parliamentary paper), , The Hague: Government of the Netherlands; Chan, T.W., Goldthorpe, J.H., The social stratification of theatre, dance and cinema attendance (2005) Cultural Trends, 14 (3), pp. 193-212; De Graaf, P., Kalmijn, M., Kraaykamp, G., Monden, C., (2010), The Netherlands longitudinal lifecourse study (NELLS Wave 1), Tilburg/Nijmegen; DiMaggio, P., Mukhtar, T., Arts participation as cultural capital in the United States, 1982–2002: Signs of decline?

State and local governments often encourage concert development by subsidizing construction and operation of concert venues. The facilities most likely to receive public support also host professional sports franchises. Public policy arguments supporting subsidization often maintain that concert frequency declines as facilities age, thus necessitating their replacement. Anecdotal evidence is inconsistent on the matter. Using a two-year pooled cross-section of 1234 concerts in 80 professional sports facilities from July 2012 to June 2014, the present study tests if facility age predicts changes in concert frequency and attendance. The results lend support to subsidy proponents' arguments, but the magnitude of the age effects is unlikely to warrant significant subsidy levels. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.","arenas; attendance; concerts; popular music; stadiums; subsidies",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"(2015) 2014 National Arts Index, , Washington, DC: Author; Andersson, T.D., Armbrecht, J., Lundberg, E., Estimating use and non-use values of a music festival (2012) Scandinavian Journal of Hospitality and Tourism, 12 (3), pp. 215-231; Appleton, I., (2008) Buildings for the performing arts, , 2nd ed., Oxford: Architectural Press; Arthurs, A., Hodsoll, F., Lavine, S., For-profit and not-for-profit arts connections: Existing and potential (1999) The Journal of Arts Management, Law, and Society, 29 (2), pp. 80-96; Bast, J.L., When the community owns an NFL franchise: Is Green Bay's story unique (2011) GroundSwell, 24 (5), pp. 12-15; Bracalente, B., Chirieleison, C., Cossignani, M., Ferrucci, L., Gigliotti, M., Ranalli, M.G., The economic impact of cultural events: The Umbria Jazz music festival (2011) Tourism Economics, 17 (6), pp. 1235-1255; Coates, D., Humphreys, B.R., Novelty effects of new facilities on attendance at professional sporting events (2005) Contemporary Economic Policy, 23 (3), pp. 436-455; Cowen, T., (1998) In praise of commercial culture, , Cambridge: Harvard University Press; Eckard, W.E., Smith, M.A., The revenue gains from multi-tier ticket pricing: Evidence from pop music concerts (2012) Managerial and Decision Economics, 33 (7-8), pp. 463-473; Eckard, W.E., Smith, M.A., The impact of price discrimination on consumer surplus at popular music concerts (2013) Economic Letters, 118 (1), pp. 222-224; Filaroski, P.D., (2000), May, Making a case for a new arena.

Other studies have been dominated by instrumental accounts exploring the potential economic benefit and skills development facilitated by young people's cultural encounters and experiences. In this paper we examine the findings of a nine month project, which set out to explore what cultural value means to young people in Bristol. Between October 2013 and March 2014, the Arts and Humanities Research Council “Teenage Kicks” project organised 14 workshops at 7 different locations across the city, with young people aged 11–20. Working in collaboration with a network of cultural and arts organisations, the study gathered a range of empirical data investigating the complex ecologies of young people's everyday/“lived” cultures and values. Young people's own accounts of their cultural practices challenge normative definitions of culture and cultural value but also demonstrate how these definitions act to reproduce social inequalities in relation to cultural participation and social and cultural capital. The paper concludes that cultural policy-makers should listen and take young people's voices seriously in re-imaging the city's cultural offer for all young people. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.","cultural value; social and spatial inequalities; young people; youth voice",,,,,,"Arts and Humanities Research Council, AHRC","The project was funded by the Arts and Humanities Research Council under the Cultural Value call.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Allen, K., Hollingworth, S., Sticky subjects’ or ‘cosmopolitan creatives’? social class, place and urban young people's aspirations for work in the knowledge economy (2013) Urban Studies, 50 (3), pp. 499-517; Bennett, A., (2005) Culture and everyday life, , London: Sage; Bragg, S., Now it's up to us to interpret it: Youth voice and visual methods (2011) Researching creative learning: Methods and issues, pp. 88-103. , Thomson P., Sefton-Green J., (eds), London: Routledge; Bourdieu, P., (1984) Distinction: A social critique of the judgement of taste, , London: Routledge; Crossick, G., Kaszynska, P., Under construction: Towards a framework for cultural value (2014) Cultural Trends, 23 (2), pp. 120-131; Gallacher, L., Gallagher, M., Methodological immaturity in childhood research?: Thinking through (2008) Childhood, 15 (4), pp. 499-516; Holloway, S.L., Changing children's geographies (2014) Children's Geographies, 12 (4), pp. 377-392; Jenkins, H., (2013) Textual poachers: Television fans and popular culture, , Oxon: Routledge; Kennelly, J., Dillabough, J., Young people mobilizing the language of citizenship: Struggles for classification and new meaning in an uncertain world (2008) British Journal of Sociology of Education, 29 (5), pp. 493-508; Lasen, A., Gomez-Cruz, E., Digital photography and picture sharing: Redefining the public/private divide (2009) Knowledge, Technology and Politics, 22, pp. 205-215; Lefebvre, H., (1991) The production of space, , Oxford: Blackwell; Livingstone, S., From Family television to bedroom culture: Young people's media at home (2007) Media studies: Key issues and debates, , Devereux E., (ed), London: Sage; Manchester, H., Facer, K., Digital curation: Learning and legacy in later life (2015) E-Learning and Digital Media, 12 (2), pp. 242-258; Massey, D., (2002) For space, , London: Routledge; Miles, A., (2014), https://culturalvalueproject.wordpress.com/2014/08/26/guest-post-andrew-miles-understanding-everyday-participationtowards-a-more-democratic-approach-to-cultural-value/, August, Guest post: Andrew Miles – Understanding everyday participation: Towards a more democratic approach to cultural value?

Supported by our conceptual framework of value creation, issues assessed included the expected versus experienced value of the exhibition and the individual artworks, price setting, the market mechanism surrounding the exhibition, and its enhancement. The created cultural value is facilitated by high-visibility media exposure and through development of career-enhancing networks. We have generated new insight into cultural value more generally by moving beyond dominant instrumental valuation approaches. We have addressed many of the gaps in understanding the mechanisms behind engagement with contemporary art. We have progressed theory with the assistance of our conceptual framework and supporting qualitative data. Cultural value is expressed in contemporary art through artistic production systems and its cultural messages. Artists’ cultural value is often constructed via the intrinsic worth of their work, rather than from market influences. Cultural value is often personal to the viewer, shared with others and remembered over time. It is also co-created among the other stakeholders involved. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.","art market; artists; cultural value; exhibition; instrumental value; intrinsic value",,,,,,"Arts and Humanities Research Council, AHRC

The exhibition is the only platform of this type in Scotland for new art school graduates to help progress the early stages of their careers. The arts and related cultural phenomena represent activities that now have recognised value and benefits for government, consumers and other stakeholders. The arts economy is exceptional (Abbing, 2002), creating challenges in defining and measuring all possible permutations of value. To date, non-financial outcomes have been under-researched and so we address this in our research even though they are difficult to assess (Throsby, 2003). Rodner and Thomson (2013) position the various actors in an art market network or art machine, including artists, art schools, galleries, critics, auction houses, museums and collectors. Their interactions contribute to both symbolic and financial value (Buck, 2004). Validation of contemporary artists is carried out within this space where co-branding by the artist and the institutions help raise the level of artist recognition.

This neglect is the result of a complex path dependency. The more obvious explanation is that the current situation is caused by too much humanism in the field of cultural studies, that is, the tendency to think of cultural value as an “‘ineffable’ human moment which somehow lies outside this purview of representational method” (Law, J., Rupert, E., & Savage, M. [2011]. The double social life of methods. Milton Keynes: CRESC). This may well be true in some cases but it is not the main reason why empirical and experiential data have been lacking. The absence of the phenomenological dimension is, to the contrary, best explained by not enough humanism in cultural studies. The reluctance to embrace the first-person perspective was motivated by an anxiety that this would make cultural theorists and sociologists complicit with the “dubious” theories of subjecthood originating in idealism. The default outcome of this has been the preponderance of structuralism in cultural studies which led to anti-empiricism and “theoretical heavy breathing” (Thompson, E. P. [1995]. The poverty of theory: Or an orryery of errors. London: Merlin Press). I argue that to overcome the current impasse, cultural theorists and the theorists of cultural value specifically must revisit this self-incurred suspicion of first-order constructs and address their unease with the category of experience by actively engaging first-person data. In short, the remedy I prescribe is to embrace elements of empirical, phenomenological sociology as part of the methodological framework. Looking at three projects funded by the AHRC Cultural Value Project, I show how this can be practically achieved. I conclude with some reflections on how the considerations presented here might have broader implications for the future research into cultural value, sociological inquiry and cultural policy. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.","cultural value; experience; first-order constructs; methodology; phenomenology; subjectivity",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Abbott, A., (2000) Time matters, , Chicago, IL: University of Chicago Press; Althusser, L., (2001) Lenin and philosophy and other essays, , New York, NY: Monthly Review Press; (2014) Quality of experience in the arts, , Web Publication, Author; Arnold, M., (1993) ‘Culture and anarchy’ and other writings, , Cambridge: Cambridge University Press; Aspers, P., (2004) Empirical phenomenology.

And how do these values differ between subsidised, amateur, and commercial performance? This paper addresses these questions through a survey of over 1800 spectators for theatre and dance in Tyneside in northeastern England, as well as a parallel set of focus groups, in the spring of 2014. These methods, which are designed for comprehensiveness and comparability, are being used across Europe by the Project on European Theatre Systems, a working group of theatre sociologists. Our research showed two sets of values which performances achieved; one was a common measure of performance quality, while the other described the values particular to subsidised work. This allows us to articulate both the general value of the arts and the particular values which subsidy (attempts to) facilitate. This has implications for both understandings of cultural value and for cultural policy, as the distinction between the two groups was not clean.

Through ethnographic research in London's electronic music scene and social network analysis of the SoundCloud audio sharing website (which is dominated by electronic dance music and, to a lesser extent, hip hop), it uncovers substantial patterns of geographical inequality. London is found at the very centre of a network of valuing relationships, in which New York and Los Angeles occupy the next most privileged locations, followed by Berlin, Paris, and Chicago. Cities outside Western Europe and the Anglophone world tend to occupy peripheral positions in the network. This finding suggests that location plays a major role in the circulation of value, even when we might expect that role to have been curtailed by an ostensibly “placeless” medium for the distribution and valuing of music. While there are reasons for the metropolitan emplacedness of dance music – given the importance of the relationship between production, consumption, and live DJing – the privileging of particular cities also mirrors patterns of inequality in the wider cultural economy. That London should appear so supremely privileged reflects both the exporting strength of British creative industries and the imbalanced nature of the UK's cultural economy. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.","cultural value; electronic dance music; ethnography; social network analysis",,,,,,,"This work was supported by the Arts and L014602/1].",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Allington, D., (2013), http://culturalvalueinitiative.org/2013/12/05/intrinsically-cultural-value-sociological-perspective-daniel-allington/, Intrinsically cultural value: A sociological perspective.

The analysis looks at employment behavior among artists as an occupational group compared to other creative class workers and analyzes trends in periods before, during and after the recession. The results suggest that as a result of the downturn, many artists changed occupations to non-arts-related work or left the workforce altogether; artists became self-employed, and new artists opted for self-employment over wage/salary work; artists were disproportionately adversely impacted – either unemployed or underemployed – than other types of workers. Level of educational attainment was a significant determinant of whether an artist maintained quality employment and stayed in the occupation of his choice; and gender and marital status had a bearing on artists' ability to remain employed as an artist and maintain quality employment. The analysis emphasizes the importance of examining specific occupations within the creative class before drawing broad conclusions pertaining to all occupations with this title. Future work will test the conclusions in this study by using longitudinal data on artists. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.","artists; creative class; Current Population Survey; determinants; employment; recession",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Alper, N., Wassall, G., (2000) More than once in a blue moon: Multiple job holdings by American artists, , Washington, DC: National Endowment for the Arts; Autor, D., Human capital and economic activity in urban America (2010) Regional Studies, 45, pp. 1079-1090; Bain, A., McLean, H., The artistic Precariat (2012) Cambridge Journal of Regions, Economy and Society; Bartley, M., (2006) Capability and resilience: Beating the odds, , London: University College London, Department of Epidemiology and Public Health; Becker, H., (1982) Art worlds, , Oakland: University of California Press; Currid, E., (2008) The Warhol economy: How fashion, art, and music drive New York City, , Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press; Currid-Halkett, E., Stolarick, K., Baptism by fire: Did the creative class generate economic growth during the crisis?

There is also a sense that neither players nor policy-makers completely understand the specificities of how IP may be creatively, if not legally infringed. As a result, there has increasingly been a shift towards the construction of a culture of self-regulation for indie developers, attempting to publicly shame cloners via social media, directly impacting infringers' reputation and sales and bypassing formal regulation.This article uses interviews and workshop discussions with developers to examine the manner in which this informal culture of regulation has been perpetuated in relation to current videogame copyright legislation, and suggests how the interrelation between producers and policy-makers may help to inform the direction of future policy decisions. Examining the way appropriate practice is informally managed in independent gaming, the article considers the soundness of policy in the contemporary videogames industry. © 2015, © 2015 The Author(s).

The National Endowment for the Arts’ Survey of Public Participation in the Arts (SPPA) is the primary source of arts participation data in the USA, but this instrument inadequately evaluates how members of minority and immigrant communities participate in the arts. As the USA nears a historic demographic shift to being a majority–minority nation – non-Hispanic White individuals will no longer be a demographic majority by about 2041 – obtaining more accurate measures of artistic activities that are meaningful to a more diverse population will be of increasing importance for public policy-making. To better understand the extent to which the SPPA's questions capture the range of artistic activities engaged in by members of immigrant communities, we cognitively tested a subset of the survey's questions with Chinese immigrants to the USA as a pilot case. We found that interviewees participate in a range of culturally specific and non-culturally specific arts activities that they did not report in response to the survey's questions. In this article, we draw upon these interviews to discuss the reasons underpinning the gap and suggest implications for updating research tools and future research. A better understanding of the gap between measured and actual “arts participation” will lead to improved measures and information to support artistic expression and arts more reflective of contemporary society. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.","arts participation; cognitive interviewing; cultural participation; cultural practice; immigrants; survey design",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Alvarez, M., (2005) There's nothing informal about it: Participatory arts within the cultural ecology of silicon valley, , San Jose, CA: Cultural Initiatives Silicon Valley; Belfiore, E., Bennett, O., Determinants of impact: Towards a better understanding of encounters with the arts (2007) Cultural Trends, 16 (3), pp. 225-275; Berkanovic, E., The effect of inadequate language translation on Hispanics’ responses to health surveys (1980) American Journal of Public Health, 70 (12), pp. 1273-1276; Blume-Kohout, M.E., Leonard, S.R., Novak-Leonard, J.L., (2015) When going gets tough: Barriers and motivations affecting arts attendance, , Washington, DC: National Endowment for the Arts; Brown, A., An architecture of value (2006) Grantmakers in the Arts, 17 (1), pp. 18-25; Brown, J.E., (2001) There is no word for art teaching spirits: Understanding Native American religious traditions, pp. 61-82. , New York, NY: Oxford University Press; Davidov, E., De Beuckelaer, A., How harmful are survey translations?

While the festivals, large-scale art exhibitions and literary conferences supported by such policies play a vital part in the cultural landscape, in recent years they have been increasingly criticised as actually preventing creativity and innovativeness. The claim is that they foster a limited number of creative individuals while rejecting others, and that they are dominated by Western cultural norms that erase cultural diversity. A lack of wide-ranging empirical data with which to substantiate such claims, particularly from an historical perspective, has led to the creation of a 15,000-entry database with the names, nationalities and other details of the artists participating in perennial exhibitions, such as documenta, the Havana Biennial, Istanbul Biennial and Gwangju Biennale. These biennials and perennial exhibitions are widely regarded as vital to the definition of artistic standards and innovations in the visual arts, as exerting an important influence both in their home countries and abroad, and as encouraging the participation of artists from around the world. The first part of this paper considers which artists have appeared in regularly occurring exhibitions, determining whether the majority of them are, indeed, the same and whether there is any bias towards a particular cultural region. The second part inquires whether biennials and other regularly occurring exhibitions in the Western hemisphere “ignore” artists from other regions, or whether they, in fact, represent a global perspective. In short, this paper explores the cultural diversity of these perennial exhibitions and determines whether they favour artists from particular regions, while excluding others. The findings reveal that the data do not support these assumptions and that international exhibitions do, in fact, contribute to creativity, diversity and multiculturalism. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.","biennials; creativity; cultural diversity; cultural policy; innovation; Western culture",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Aitkenhead, D., (2012), http://www.guardian.co.uk/artanddesign/2012/mar/25/grayson-perry-interesting-thing-damien-hirst, Grayson Perry: “The most interesting thing about Damien Hirst is probably his accounts”.

Increasing importance has been ascribed to the role of landscape in public health research and to the environmental factors, which contribute to enhanced quality of life. In reviewing the ways that community archaeology projects are evaluated, and in summarising current practice, we observe that the evidence produced is often anecdotal. However, it is possible to increase robust therapeutic evaluation in ways that might be expected from other disciplinary perspectives and to draw on recent work in the role of the arts in health. This paper highlights that many of those currently engaged in community archaeology are self-selecting, and represent only a small subset of society. The narrow scope of engagement is borne out by Heritage Lottery Fund-commissioned research which found that, whilst volunteering has a significant positive impact on participants, they tend to be white, well-educated and live in the most affluent areas. If historic environment practitioners are to claim therapeutic benefits from their work, then the issue of inequity of access to health benefits is a significant concern for the profession. It is not just a matter of social justice but a concern for the arts and humanities sector, which is currently required to justify its public value [Bate, J. (2011). Public value of the humanities.

At a crucial time of political and technological change, Scotland finds itself competing within a highly competitive global market to identify, attract and retain creative talent and strengthen its skills base. As such, developing “talent” is a key aspect of the Scottish Government's Strategy for the Creative Industries. However, while creativity has been interrogated across academic disciplines in recent years, talent remains under-theorised within the academy and lacks a clear definition across policy and industry. Taking the screen industries as its focus, this paper draws on empirical data derived from a series of knowledge exchange workshops funded by the Royal Society of Edinburgh designed to initiate dialogue between academics, policy-makers and stakeholders within Scotland and beyond. In doing so, it scopes out some of the key ways in which screen “talent” is conceptualised by these groups and raises questions regarding how particular understandings may impact on policies designed to identify, attract and retain a diverse range of skilled workers within the sector. We argue that greater precision should be used in policy discourse to emphasise the importance of developing particular and discrete craft skills rather than privileging a workforce that is highly flexible and mobile.

Extraordinarily, and with little public debate, the then Director-General, Mark Thompson, conceded to a real-terms cut in the BBC’s income of 16 per cent within weeks of Cameron coming to power in 2010. This was achieved through the freezing of the licence fee and the removal of long-standing Foreign and Commonwealth Office funding for the World Service. Abandoning its usually sceptical stance on government policy, this once fiercely independent organisation accepted unquestioningly the fashionable coalition rhetoric on the budget deficit and its desire to eliminate it, in part at the expense of public spending. Despite the clearly ambassadorial role of the BBC World Service, instead of the taxpayer it became the licence-fee payer who would bear the cost of providing the service. This may seem like a mere technicality, but it contributed significantly to the coalition’s deliberate squeeze on publicly owned and funded broadcasting.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Crisell, A., (1994) Understanding radio, , London: Routledge; (2014) Ed Vaizey’s speech at the Radio Festival 2014, , https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/ed-vaizeys-speech-at-the-radio-festival-2014, London: Author, Retrieved October 15, 2014, from; Halesworth, B., (1971) ‘Radio – the Cinderella medium’.

They contain arguments for greater policy attention to the creative economy worldwide and statistical data to illustrate their claims. These reports argue that the creative economy is an area of growth, not only in “developed”, but also in “developing” economies. The central argument of this article is that the way the country classification used in the CERs increases the share of “developing countries” in global creative goods exports in contrast to The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) classifications. When singling out China, the share of these countries decreases even further. According to The United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), in 2010, 41 “developed” countries account for 51.18 per cent and 158 “developing” countries for 48.03 per cent of the global creative economy with 17 economies in transition accounting for 0.79 per cent. This obfuscates reality and obstructs the creation of evidence-based policies relevant to the creative industries. The classification of developed and developing countries is redrawn in accordance with building on data on the export of creative goods, provided by UNCTADstat. This article proposes that a more correct, balanced, and disaggregated outlook on the classification of countries is needed because one single “developing country” (China) is the single biggest exporter of creative goods in the world (25.51 per cent in 2010) yet the 49 “least developed countries” account for merely 0.11 per cent of creative goods exports (in 2010) while they comprise 880 million people (or some 12 per cent of the world's population). In conclusion, it is argued that different kinds of developing countries need different approaches and policies. Reference is made to Burkina Faso to illustrate this point. © 2014, Taylor & Francis.","creative economy; creative industries; cultural industries; culture; human development; UNCTAD",,,,,,"European Cultural Foundation, ECF","A previous version of this article has been presented at the Sixth International Conference of Cultural Policy Research at the University of Jyväskylä in 2010, where Pertti Alasuutari provided helpful comments.

An economic assessment of cultural institutions is usually made in monetary units. This one-dimensional assessment of value has been criticized for being elusive, disregarding the complex and multidimensional nature of cultural values. This article suggests scales for measuring the value of cultural institutions. Based on previous research, and an exploratory study on the perceived value of cultural institutions, this article describes the development of a scale using exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses. Six factors comprise the scale: social, educational, health, image, identity and financial effects. The scale may be used to describe and compare the value of cultural institutions qualitatively. Conclusions about the perceived contribution of different institutions may be possible. From a policy perspective, the scale may allow an understanding of the contribution individuals with different socioeconomic backgrounds perceive the cultural institution as making. © 2014, Taylor & Francis.","cultural institutions; factor analysis; perceived value; public goods; scale development; socio-cultural value",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Andersson, T.D., (1985), Vad hände när Bruce var i stan?

It examines the ideas behind regional creative industries policies (RCIPs) and their implementation. Focusing on the activities of the English regional development agencies, the primary bodies responsible for the implementation of creative industries policy in the British regions, the article places regional cultural policy during the New Labour period within its broader political, social and economic contexts. It explains and evaluates New Labour’s RCIPs, arguing that creative industries policy at the regional level changed over the course of New Labour’s three terms of office, becoming increasingly economistic at the expense of a more social democratic vision of regional equality and democracy. We identify three issues that were problematic for New Labour’s RCIP: a reliance on the idea of “clusters”, commercialisation and shifting regional governance. © 2014, Taylor & Francis.","clustering; creative industries; cultural policy; governance; New Labour; regionalism",,,,,,"Arts and Humanities Research Council, AHRC: AH/I026308/1",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"(2013), http://artsandbusiness.bitc.org.uk/sites/default/files/kcfinder/files/artsandbusiness/artsandbusiness-pics-2011-12.pdf, Where is private investment to the arts going?

This paper explores whether there are stable latent clusters of cultural engagement over time and whether age–period–cohort (APC) effects explain within-person changes between these clusters across the life course. Using data from the British Household Panel Survey (N = 25,149), I conduct longitudinal latent class analysis to uncover the latent patterns of cultural consumption across nine activities: cinema, watching live sport, attending the theatre, eating at a restaurant, doing DIY, attending an evening class, meeting with local groups, volunteering, and going to a club/pub. Then, I explore whether APC effects are observable in the data using scatterplot smoothing, lowess regression. Six latent clusters are consistently observed in each wave: None, DIY, Restaurant/Pub, Cinema/Theatre, Volunteer, and All (almost all activities). A large number of respondents have highly stable patterns of cultural engagement but there is also a substantial degree of variation. Transitions between latent clusters over time occur between those that are compositionally similar (in terms of activities). These changes in patterns of cultural engagement are partially explained by age effects, such as time constraints and health. Additionally, there is some evidence of cohort effects among the youngest cohorts moving into the “All” latent cluster, the cluster with the most cultural breadth. © 2014, Taylor & Francis.","age; Bourdieu; cultural engagement; latent classes; life course; omnivore",,,,,,"Economic and Social Research Council, ESRC: ES/I902341/1","This research is funded by a grant from the Economic and Social Research Council [ES/I902341/1].",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Alwin, D.F., McCammon, R.J., Generations, cohorts, and social change (2003) Handbook of the life course, pp. 23-50. , Mortimer J.

However, it remains to be seen whether attempts to deconstruct homogenous discourses of nationhood at the level of the state or institution are capable of radically altering individual understandings of national identity and belonging. Further empirical research is therefore needed into the way in which heritage is produced and negotiated in everyday social environments beyond the museum in order to understand what - if any - impact museums may have on challenging prejudice and producing inclusive definitions of national identity. Drawing on Mason's (2013) ""cosmopolitan museology"" and Rounds' (2006) theory of ""identity work"" in museums, this paper analyses the narratives of young people aged between 13 and 18 years old from six schools in Glasgow, Edinburgh, the Scottish Borders and the Western Isles. It argues that when negotiating national identity and cultural diversity, individuals adopt narrative strategies in order to accommodate new information without necessarily changing their own definitions of national heritage or attitudes towards minority groups. The implications of this finding for both museum practice in Scotland and the wider European context are considered. © 2014 Taylor & Francis.","diversity; migration; museums; national identity; Scotland",,,,,,"Arts and Humanities Research Council, AHRC","This work was supported by the AHRC.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Aronsson, P., Knell, S., Amundsen, A.B., Axelsson, B., Bodenstein, F., Bounia, A., Elizabeth, W., (2012) National museums making history in a diverse Europe, , Linköping, Linköping,: Linköping University Electronic Press; Bennett, T., Exhibition, difference and the logic of culture (2006) Museum frictions: Public cultures/global transformations, , Durham, Durham,: Duke University Press; Brown, W., (2009) Regulating aversion: Tolerance in the age of identity and Empire, , Princeton, Princeton,: Princeton University Press; Cooke, S., McLean, F., Picturing the nation: The Celtic periphery as discursive other in the archaeological displays of the museum of Scotland (2002) Scottish Geographical Journal, 118 (4), pp. 283-298; Dewdney, A., Dibosa, D., Walsh, V., (2013) Post-critical museology: Theory and practice in the art museum, , London, London,: Routledge; Dodd, J., Jones, C., Sawyer, A., Tseliou, M.A., (2012) Voices from the museum: Qualitative research conducted in Europe's national museums, , Linköping, Linköping,: Linköping University Electronic Press; Doering, Z.D., Pekarik, A.J., Questioning the entrance narrative (1996) Journal of Museum Education, 21 (3), pp. 20-25; Eriksen, T.H., (1993) Ethnicity and nationalism: Anthropological perspectives, , London, London,: Pluto Press; Falk, J., Dierking, L., (2000) Learning from museums: Visitor experiences and the making of meaning, , Walnut Creek, CA, Walnut Creek, CA,: Atamira Press; Fladmark, J.M., (1999) Heritage & museums: Shaping national identity, , Aberdeen, Aberdeen,: Donhead Publishing Ltd; Giddens, A., (1991) Modernity and self-identity, , Stanford, Stanford,: Stanford University Press; Goffman, E., (1959) The presentation of the self in everyday life, , New York, New York,: Anchor Books; Golding, V., (2009) Learning at the museum frontiers: Identity, race and power, , Ashgate; Hall, S., Whose heritage?

The consultation process revealed a strong and widely expressed desire for the Scottish Executive to lead and create a national cultural strategy, which would state clearly what culture meant to Scotland, the role it played throughout Scotland and on an international stage. There was a clear demand for structural change, an aspiration for change in education and a desire to be involved in celebrating and sharing Scotland's rich and diverse culture in all its aspects, to recognise Scotland's past and present culture as well as plan the future. Over the next decade, post-devolution, successive ministers and administrations embarked on a turbulent journey of policy setting, strategy development and structural change. They took action in some of the key areas identified in 1999, including those concerning Scotland's international image, the creative industries and Scotland's languages and education. The most recent statements on cultural policy are contained in the White Paper on Independence published in November 2013. This paper reviews the issues prevalent during the 1999 consultation and reflects on those that have been addressed, superseded and those that remain unresolved. © 2014 Taylor & Francis.","cultural consultation; cultural policy; cultural strategy; national; Scotland",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Bianchini, F., Remaking European cities: The role of cultural policies (1993) In Cultural policy and urban regeneration: The West European experience, pp. 1-20. , In: Bianchini F., Parkinson M., editors Manchester, Manchester,: Manchester University Press; (2000) A national cultural strategy for Scotland, , http://annebonnar.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/a-national-cultural-strategy-for-scotland-2000-consultation-report.pdf, Bonnar Keenlyside., Report of consultation.

The change is in line with a broader shift away from thinking of the arts as cultural activity in need of subsidy and towards treating them as part of the creative economy. The current cultural policy landscape pertaining to popular music is mapped out, drawing on interviews and an online survey with members of the Scottish Music Industry Association (SMIA) and complementary interviews with stakeholders from relevant government and arms-length funding and development bodies. The Scottish Government's (SG) White Paper on independence highlighted the creative industries as one of five growth sectors key to the Scottish economy, but for popular music - and in line with the global music industry - many working in the Scottish music industry face acute challenges. Given EU regulations (and the Scottish Government's preference to remain in the EU) and international agreements in areas like broadcasting and copyright, if they are to flourish many members of the SMIA will likely need to strengthen their relationships with the wider UK and global music industry, regardless of the outcome of the referendum on independence. © 2014 The Authors.

However, by 2013 the organisation was embroiled in a public dispute with a number of the individuals and organisations it was established to support. This short paper considers this ""crisis"" as a discursive event [Wodak, R., & Meyer, M. 2009. Methods of critical discourse analysis. London: SAGE], and informed by a discourse analysis of various texts, it identifies the core narrative as being one in which a distiguishable body of ""artists"" and their supporters are resisting a dangerous ideological power-grab by ""non-artist"" bureaucrats. It proposes that this relies upon the well-worn discursive knot of the instrumental versus the intrinsic, which facilitates a continuing obscuration of the prevailing power relationships within the network of publicly subsidised culture in Scotland. In its discursive focus on the relationship between an imagined egalitarian ""cultural community"" and Creative Scotland (CS), the narrative of the dispute overlooks the extent to which both CS and the majority of organisations it funds are primarily tools of governance by which the Scottish Government seeks to strategically shape the production and dissemination of culture in Scotland. It concludes that many of those individual artists arguing for various degrees of change were thus unwittingly complicit in supporting a status quo that makes the change they desire unlikely while simultaneously limiting public input into what sort of culture merits subsidy. © 2014 Taylor & Francis.","Creative Scotland; cultural policy; discourse analysis; instrumental versus intrinsic; policy networks; Scottish cultural policy",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Baker, M., What I wrote to a parliamentary committee (2012) Sacrificial materials art and public space, , http://sacrificialmaterials.blogspot.co.uk/search?updated-max=2012-10-11T17:55:00%2B01:00&max-results=7&start=7&by-date=false, Retrieved May 12, 2014, from; Creative Scotland ""crisis"" slammed by leading artists (2012) BBC News Online, , http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-19880871, BBC., Retrieved May 12, 2014, from; Brown, I., Arnott, P., Greig, D., Harrower, D., Harris, Z., McLean, L., Maxwell, D., (2012) Open letter to Creative Scotland, , http://www.creativescotland.com/news/an-open-letter-from-sir-sandy-crombie-chairman-creative-scotland-01062012, Retrieved May 12, 2014, from; (2010) 01/07/2010 - Creative Scotland, Scotland's new cultural development body is formally established, , http://www.creativescotland.com/news/010710-creative-scotland-scotland%E2%80%99s-new-cultural-development-body-is-formally-established, Creative Scotland., Retrieved May 12, 2014, from; (2011) Investing in Scotland's creative future: Corporate plan 2011-2014, , http://www.creativescotland.com/resources/our-publications/corporate-plan, Creative Scotland., Retrieved May 12, 2014, from; (2005) Our next major enterprise: Final report of the cultural commission., , Cultural Commission., Edinburgh, Edinburgh,: Author; Publically funded Creative Scotland scrutinised by MSPs over possible vital infrastructure destruction (2012) Daily Record Online, , http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/publicly-funded-creative-scotland-scrutinised-1329429, Daily Record., Retrieved May 12, 2014, from; Gailey, J., A Creative Scotland in waiting (2013) AN online, , http://new.a-n.co.uk/news/single/a-creative-scotland-in-waiting/26, Retrieved May 12, 2014, from; Galloway, S., Jones, H., The Scottish dimension of British arts government: A historical perspective (2010) Cultural Trends, 19 (1-2), pp. 27-40; Gray, C., (2000) The politics of the arts in Britain, , Basingstoke, Basingstoke,: MacMillan; Gray, C., Democratic cultural policy: Democratic forms and policy consequences (2012) International Journal of Cultural Policy, 18 (5), pp. 505-518; Greig, D., (2012) Letter to Creative Scotland, , http://www.front-step.co.uk/2012/05/30/letter-to-creative-scotland/, Retrieved May 12, 2014, from; Greig, D., Ainsley, S., Anderson, D., Arnott, P., Barclay, C., Bevan, A., Wright, R., Open letter to Creative Scotland (2012) BBC News Scotland Online, , http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-19880871, Retrieved May 12, 2014, from; Hamilton, C., Scullion, A., Flagship or flagging? the post-devolution role of Scotland's 'National' companies (2003) Scottish Affairs, 42, pp. 98-114; Higgins, C., (2012) The arts funding row in Scotland and why it matters to the rest of the UK, , http://www.theguardian.com/culture/charlottehigginsblog/2012/jul/09/arts-funding-row-scotland?intcmp=239, Charlotte Higgins on Culture Blog, Retrieved May 12, 2014, from; Creative Scotland is getting it right (2012) The stage features: Letters of the week, , http://www.thestage.co.uk/features/analysis-opinion/2012/12/letters-of-the-week-december-13-2012/, Retrieved May 12, 2014, from; Hyslop, F., (2012) Letter from Fiona Hyslop to Sir Sandy Crombie, , http://www.creativescotland.com/sites/default/files/editor/Cabinet_Secretary_Letter_of_Guidance_-__July_2012.pdf, Retrieved May 12, 2014 from, July; Hyslop, F., (2013) Past, present and future: Culture and heritage in an independent Scotland.

The public policy discourse of traditional arts is at once politically related to a growing Scottish confidence and intimately bound into a personal and national politics of identity. Today, in this transitional time around the referendum on Scottish independence, the potential for Scottish traditional arts to make a substantial and more sustainable contribution to cultural life in Scotland is within reach. However, there are some underlying problems that need to be addressed by the community of policy-makers and artists. In this paper, I examine the commodification and professionalization of Scottish traditional arts in broad terms and then go on to use this as a means to understand the recent emergence of a national cultural policy of intrinsic worth for the traditional arts since 1993. I finally consider the possibilities and opportunities for a more robust cultural policy for the Scottish traditional arts post-referendum. In recognizing that traditional music has entered a new and self-conscious period of commodification today, we open the door for a debate about the ways in which traditional arts in contemporary society can be performed and supported in a more equitable national cultural policy. © 2014 Taylor & Francis.","arts; cultural policy; nationalism; Scotland; traditional music",,,,,,,"This work was supported by the Arts and L006502/1].",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Alexander, V.D., State support of artists: The case of the United Kingdom in a new labour environment and beyond (2007) The Journal of Arts Management, Law, and Society, 37, pp. 185-200; Belfiore, E., Bennett, O., (2008) The social impact of the arts: An intellectual history, , New York, NY, New York, NY,: Palgrave Macmillan; Bennett, T., Savage, M., Introduction: Cultural capital and cultural policy (2004) Cultural Trends, 13, pp. 7-14; Bohlman, P.V., (1988) The study of folk music in the modern world, , Bloomington, Bloomington,: Indiana University Press; Boyes, G., (1993) The imagined village: Culture, ideology, and the English folk revival, , Leeds, Leeds,: No Masters Co-operative; Cornwell, T., Pipers call the tune as grants of GBP 300,000 get go-ahead (2008) The Scotsman, , (Edinburgh) (1st ed., September 6; Cowan, E.J., (1991) The people's past, , Edinburgh, Edinburgh,: Polygon; (2012) Creative Scotland annual report and financial statements for the year ended 31st March 2012, , http://www.creativescotland.com/resources/our-publications, Creative Scotland.

One of the essential elements of this work was the incorporation of a Māori perspective in recognition of the Treaty of Waitangi and the importance of the indigenous Māori culture. Manatū Taonga Ministry for Culture and Heritage has primary central government responsibility for cultural policy and advice and the reporting of national cultural indicators. The term ""culture"" in this context broadly refers to Māori culture and the cultures of all New Zealanders, and to endeavours relating to arts, heritage, media, and sport and recreation. The Ministry is currently scoping a programme of research that aims to refine the indicators; relate indicators more clearly to the cultural policy role of government (and in turn their related cultural agencies); and more clearly articulate the relationship that cultural sector indicators have with those of other sectors. Cultural sector consultation to identify and clarify perspectives and reconfirm a common terminology (if not understanding) will be an essential and important part of this work. Better contextualising the national indicators will make them more meaningful and useful for reinforcing the importance and value of the cultural sector; monitoring the ""health"" and performance of the cultural sector over time; providing useful quality information; measuring the effectiveness of policy interventions and connecting across the cultural sector and to other sectors. This paper outlines the New Zealand context and the development and reporting of national indicators; reflects on the usefulness of reporting national indicators to date; and describes and discusses the intended direction of further work. © 2014 © 2014 Taylor & Francis.","cultural indicators; economic; government; instrumental; social; value",,,,,,,"Key elements of the development of national cultural indicators included a cross-government and cultural sector consultative emphasis, inclusion of a Māori perspective, building on existing knowledge and situating the work within the New Zealand context.

It was overseen by a cross-government Steering Group with representatives from nine government agencies reflecting the cross portfolio government interest in cultural sector policy and outcomes.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Allan, C., Grimes, A., Kerr, S., (2013) Value and culture: An economic framework, , Wellington, Wellington,: Ministry for Culture and Heritage; Bakhshi, H., (2012) Measuring cultural value - Keynote speech, , http://www.nesta.org.uk/publications/measuring-cultural-value, Retrieved from; Brown, A., (2006) An architecture of value.

In 2009, Statistics Canada launched a four-year Feasibility Study to culminate in the creation of a Canadian Culture Satellite Account (CSA), an accounting framework to measure the impact of culture, the arts, heritage and sport on the Canadian economy. Taking account of both the recent and broader historical context out of which the CSA emerged, this paper examines its intended use and future plans. The CSA is a useful tool to the Government of Canada in supporting its activities related to the funding of culture, but this paper takes the position that it is not in and of itself a sufficient means for measuring the value of culture in Canada, and so it is best understood as part of a constellation of tools with differing but complementary approaches. © 2014 © 2014 Taylor & Francis.","Canada; Cultural Satellite Account; cultural statistics; Statistics Canada",,,,,,,"The information provided by the CSA is, of course, of value to more than Canadian Heritage. Indeed, the project has been supported by several partners, including provincial and territorial departments and ministries of culture, heritage, sport, recreation and tourism.

Structurally, the article begins with a discussion of the relationship between sporting mega-events and culture, focusing specifically (although not exclusively) on the sport and cultural nexus around the Olympic Games. The discussion then moves to consider conceptual, policy and practice debates around cultural value, examining the extent to which existing research tools and techniques satisfactorily capture the contribution of culture to major events, public and social policy. Methodologically, the article draws on elite interviews with strategic stakeholders directly involved in the design, delivery and evaluation of Scotland's London 2012 Cultural Programme. The authors conclude that, when taken alongside other cultural evaluations conducted nationally and internationally, there is a need to develop a multi-criteria analysis (MCA) that can more effectively capture cultural value around major sporting events in the UK. This study has demonstrated a level of dissatisfaction within the Scottish cultural community about the limitations of existing mechanisms for measuring the value of culture within the mega-event platform. A robust, but nuanced, impact assessment is required because, unlike the UK as a whole, Scotland has a unique opportunity to undertake a longitudinal study assessing the conditions for legacy put in place as a result of the London 2012 Olympic Games for the subsequent 2014 Commonwealth Games in Glasgow. However, further research is required into the efficacy of the MCA for assessing cultural value generally and within the framework of major sports events, in particular. © 2013 Taylor & Francis.","Cultural Olympiad; cultural value; impact assessment; mega-events; Olympic Games; Scotland",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Belfiore, E., Bennett, O., Rethinking the social impact of the arts (2007) International Journal of Cultural Policy, 13 (2), pp. 135-151; (2011) Creative Scotland: Scotland's London 2012 and Glasgow 2014 Cultural Plan, , December, Creative Scotland, Glasgow: Creative Scotland; (2009) Multi-criteria analysis: A manual, , Department for Local Government and Communities, London, London,: Author, January; Foley, M., McGillivray, D., McPherson, G., (2011) Event policy: From theory to strategy, , London, London,: Routledge; Garcia, B., Urban regeneration, arts programming and major events (2004) International Journal of Cultural Policy, 10 (1), pp. 103-118; Garcia, B., (2012) The Olympic Games and cultural policy, , London, London,: Routledge; Gilmore, A., Counting eyeballs, soundbites and ""plings"": Arts participation, strategic instrumentalism and the London 2012 Cultural Olympiad (2012) International Journal of Cultural Policy, 18 (2), pp. 151-167; Gold, J.R., Gold, M.M., (2005) Cities of culture: Staging international festivals and the urban agenda 1851-2000, , Aldershot, Aldershot,: Ashgate; Gold, M.M., Revill, G., The Cultural Olympiads: Reviving the Panegyris (2007) Olympic cities, pp. 59-83. , In: Gold J.

These evaluations provide insights into the behaviour and attitudes of visitors and the ways in which particular exhibitions, exhibits and information resources facilitate engagement, participation and learning. Unfortunately, however, summative evaluation has relatively little impact either on the particular initiative or more generally in contributing to our knowledge of visitor behaviour and understanding of best practice. In this paper, we suggest that the relative lack of impact of summative evaluation is not primarily due to any methodological shortcomings or the idiosyncrasies of some of the approaches that are used. Rather, the organisational and institutional context in which summative evaluation is commissioned, undertaken and received can impose contradictory demands and undermine the opportunity of learning from and applying the findings of evaluation. © 2013 Taylor & Francis.","evidence; galleries; impact; museums; participation; summative evaluation; visitors",,,,,,"Wellcome Trust, WT","Our apologies for ruthlessly corrupting the title of Garfinkel’s (1967) seminal chapter “Good” organisational reasons for “bad” clinical records.

However, the Department for Culture, Media, and Sport, and the London Organising Committee of the Olympic Games (LOCOG) made no reference to sporting history within official documentation, and there was no mention of sport in the Cultural Olympiad programme. This paper aims to understand the role of the Sports Heritage Network in exploring England's sporting heritage, despite being excluded from the official planning of the London 2012 Olympic Games. This affiliation of museums and archives with an interest in England's sporting past recognised the potential of the 2012 Olympic Games and established a community exhibition programme, Our Sporting Life, which aligned with LOCOG's aims and objectives. This paper evaluates the outputs and outcomes of Our Sporting Life and aims to understand why it was not supported financially or integrated into the official Cultural Olympiad programme. The data collection for Our Sporting Life is analysed and critiqued, and the impact of the programme is considered using the Generic Learning Outcomes and the Generic Social Outcomes frameworks. Our Sporting Life delivered over a hundred exhibitions and reached over one million people, with outcomes that included increasing knowledge and understanding, and strengthening public life. It provides an off-the-shelf methodology for future major sporting events and, as such, its omission from the London 2012 Cultural Olympiad can be regarded a lost opportunity. © 2013 Taylor & Francis.","Cultural Olympiad; Generic Learning Outcomes; Generic Social Outcomes; museums; Olympic Games; sport",,,,,,"Medical Library Association, MLA: 100,000","Our Sporting Life was funded by the MLA for a period of 12 months to the value of £100,000, which financed the initial set-up costs and a project manager to oversee the initial delivery. By the beginning of 2012, however, the money ran out and the project manager left just as exhibition activity increased nationally. Consequently, the partnerships and contacts developed by the project manager could no longer be sustained and co-ordination of the project became difficult, with some partners withdrawing, and others hosting exhibitions without notifying the central Our Sporting Life team.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Brabazon, T., (2006) Playing on the periphery: Sport, identity and memory, , London, London,: Routledge; (2005) Government response to ""A London Olympic bid for 2012"", , http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/+/http://www.culture.gov.uk/images/publications/OlympicsCm5867.pdf, Department for Culture, Media and Sport, Retrieved from; (2006) Caring for our collections, , http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=BigpRiGcYpQC&pg=PA9&lpg=PA9&dq=museums+association+cultural+olympiad&source=bl&ots=iNairbcWp0&sig=NmPyU3kQW-4cnSiG3oboG9Fjf0Q&hl=en&sa=X&ei=4okTUYnlD-Or0AWBnYD4Bg&ved=0CFUQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&q=museums%20association%20cultural%20olympiad&f=false, Department for Culture, Media and Sport.

This state of affairs has brought renewed attention to the importance of general operating support (GOS) to sustaining nonprofit arts and culture organizations. After the Culture Wars of the late 1980s and 1990s, federal GOS programs disappeared and philanthropy turned away from providing such unrestricted funds, which are typically used for salaries and overhead rather than projects. What GOS support remained was provided primarily by state and local governments. Currently, the Great Recession has prompted cuts - sometimes drastic cuts - to state arts agencies. This article uses data from the National Assembly of State Arts Agencies (NASAA) supplemented with new data on line items culled from the budgets of every US state to map state-level GOS support. Enhancing NASAA data with data on line items provides a truer picture of the levels of support state governments are providing to the sector. The new data enable us to see whether states have shifted dollars from agency budgets into line items during the period from 2009 to 2011. Such shifts can bring into focus the organizations that are best politically positioned to maintain support even when agency budgets are being cut. An assessment of the ways in which new competition for GOS resources may create or magnify inequity in the sector is provided. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","earmarks; equity; general operating support; government arts funding; great recession; unrestricted support",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"(2011) The state of the arts: A summary overview of New York city's nonprofit cultural organizations, their strengths and challenges, , http://173.231.154.70/pdfs/STATE_OF_THE_ARTS_REPORT_2011.pdf, Alliance for the Arts Retrieved from Alliance for the Arts website; Boyd, W., Museums as centers of controversy (1999) Daedalus, 128 (3), pp. 185-228; Brest, P., Smart money: General operating grants can be strategic for nonprofits and foundations (2003) Stanford Social Innovation Review, 1 (3), pp. 44-53. , Winter; Brest, P., In defense of strategic philanthropy (2005) Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society, 149 (2), pp. 132-140; Cohen, R., Cutting to the core (2002) Responsive Philanthropy, p. 9. , Fall; Curtis, E.C., (2010) National capitalization project 2010 summary, , http://www.giarts.org/sites/default/files/capitalization-project_2010-summary.pdf, Retrieved from Grantmakers in the Arts website; DiMaggio, P., Decentralization of arts funding from the federal government to the states (1991) Public money and the muse: Essays on government funding for the arts, pp. 216-236. , In: Benedict S., editors New York, New York,: W.W.

This policy analysis explores in particular a recent study conducted for the Burkinabè Ministry of Culture. Throughout the analysis there is a focus on striking issues with (1) the practical links between social and economic development, (2) definition and demarcation of culture and cultural industries, and (3) the recommendations put forward in the Report. In conclusion, it is argued that this study is timely and of some merit (particularly in showing that the cultural sector contributes 2.02% to the GDP), while much remains to be done in order to provide a more strategically useful and practically applicable understanding of the ways cultural and development policies can work to support social and economic development in the country. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","Burkina Faso; cultural industries; culture; development; economic impact; social impact",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"(2012) Etude sur les Impacts du Secteur de la Culture sur le Développement Social et Economique du Burkina Faso, , Bureau Burkinabè d'Etudes et D'Appui-Conseils, Ouagadougou, Ouagadougou,: Ministère de la Culture et du Tourisme; (2010) Stratégie de Croissance Accélérée et de Développement Durable, , Burkina Faso, Ouagadougou, Ouagadougou,: Gouvernement du Burkina Faso; Clammer, J.R., (2012) Culture, development and social theory: Towards an integrated social development, , London, London,: Zed; Hesmondhalgh, D., (2013) The cultural industries, , 3, London, London,: SAGE; Jerven, M., The relativity of poverty and income: How reliable are African economic statistics?

Utilizing the Foundation Center arts funding data, this paper seeks to explore how foundations have responded to the shifting cultural policy landscapes of the last three decades, and what roles foundations appear to pursue while navigating the new policy terrain. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","foundation roles; philanthropy; private funding; US cultural policy",,,,,,,"Grant dollars % of total arts support Number of grants Average grant size Technical assistance Grant dollars % of total arts support Number of grants Average grant size Capital support Grant dollars % of total arts support Number of grants Average grant size","Grant dollars % of total arts support Number of grants Average grant size Awards/prizes/competitions Grant dollars % of total arts support Number of grants Average grant size New work commissions Grant dollars % of total arts support Number of grants Average grant size Total % of arts support","Grant dollars % of total arts support Number of grants Average grant size Seed money Grant dollars % of total arts support Number of grants Average grant size",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Alexander, V., (1996) Museums & money: The impact of funding on exhibitions, scholarship, and management, , Bloomington, IN, Bloomington, IN,: Indiana University Press; Anheier, H., Hammack, D., (2010) Roles and contributions of foundations, , Washington, DC: Brookings Institution Press; Anheier, H., Toepler, S., Philanthropic foundations: An international perspective (1999) Private funds, public purpose: Philanthropic foundations in international perspective, pp. 3-23. , In H.

Set in the context of falling rates of participation, the strategy seeks to address key social justice issues such as poverty, isolation, loneliness and mental health. This review article establishes the context of the arts in NI in relationship to creative industries policy, the roles of arts in enabling a more integrated society, and the demographics of older people. It suggests that while the Arts and Older People Strategy has a strong social democratic agenda, the ACNI overlooks key threats to such a policy direction that come from the influence of the market, and an over reliance on the Internet for promotion. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","Arts Council for Northern Ireland; arts funding; arts policy; creative industries; older people; social justice",,,,,,"National Lottery Community Fund","The Arts Council of Northern Ireland (ACNI) is “.. . the lead development agency for the arts in Northern Ireland”, calling itself “.. . the main support for artists and arts organisations, offering a broad range of funding opportunities through our Exchequer and National Lottery funds” (ACNI, 2013).

However, recent changes in digital technologies, in modes of media consumption and in the nature and structure of leisure-time activities, have changed the usual cultural audiences. On the other side, economic crisis and cuts in public spending on arts have put additional pressure on cultural organizations. Consequently, cultural professionals are urged to constantly look for new ways of engaging their audiences and maintaining their relevance in the local, national or international milieu. The upcoming EU cultural programme, Creative Europe, strives to support cultural organizations and artists in their efforts by emphasizing the importance of developing new ways of engaging audiences across Europe. The report reviewed here is one of the several documents recently published in the EU on this topic and represents a valuable contribution to the growing discussion on cultural participation. The review offers an overview of the document and its background. Discussion is further developed around important aspects of the report including the methodology applied and the articulation of audience activity in the document. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","access to culture; audience engagement; cultural participation; cultural policy; grey literature; review",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"(2012) Access to culture in the digital era: A citizen's right, , Access to Culture, Bruxelles, Belgium, Bruxelles,: Access to Culture Platform; Bamford, A., Wimmer, M., (2012) Audience building and the future creative Europe programme, , Brussels, Brussels,: European Expert Network on Culture; (2002) Executive summary: Europeans' participation in cultural activities, , Eurostat, Brussels, Brussels,: Author; Govier, L., (2009) Leaders in co-creation?

At the core of the value system is how individuals are affected and transformed by virtue of participating. Individual arts experiences are the building blocks upon which the larger outcomes of the arts, such as social cohesion and cognitive development, are constructed. Tools for effectively measuring how art affects audiences, however, are just being explored. Anecdotal stories of impact provide helpful information. But as arts groups are called upon to provide more rigorous evidence of the impacts of their artistic programmes, a more systematic measurement approach is needed to convey the intrinsic value of their work. This article reviews initial exploratory research and subsequent research undertaken over the past six years to better understand how art affects audiences, and to develop reliable and replicable measurement approaches. The research has yielded a more nuanced, but still emergent, understanding of the emotional, intellectual, social and aesthetic constructs of intrinsic impact, methods of measuring them, and insight into the limitations and applications of this work for policy-makers and arts practitioners. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","affect measurement; arts benefits; audience experience; customer satisfaction; intrinsic impact; public value",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"(2009) Speaker series [Video file], , http://www.australiacouncil.gov.au/resources/reports_and_publications/subjects/marketing/alan_brown_video, Australia Council for the Arts September 17 Retrieved from; Artistic reflection kit: A guide to assist organisations to reflect on artistic vibrancy, , http://www.australiacouncil.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0007/84778/Audience_Impact_Surveys_factsheet.pdf, Australia Council for the Arts.

The acquisition of cultural knowledge from socially transmitted sources leads to individual cultural expression (amateur practice), which in turn generates demand for the consumption of professionally produced cultural goods and services. Using this generic model of culture, the article then traces the evolution of the arts and arts policy in the USA beginning with baseline policies protecting free speech and intellectual property, and providing tax-exempt status to non-profit forms of artistic production. Tax exemption is shown to be a significant element in the early twentieth century when emerging elites and immigrant artists split away from the mainstream of the commercial arts sector to found a separate high arts sector. In the postwar period, the high arts sector is judged to be lagging in quality and in financial decline, factors that are cited to justify major new policies characterized as ""supply-side pump-priming"". Beginning in the mid-1960s, these policies become widespread among federal, state and municipal governmental agencies and many non-governmental funders, and though the high arts grow in quality, output, and geographic distribution, they never achieve a breakthrough in attracting substantial non-elite audiences, which continue to patronize the vastly larger commercial arts. In light of recent trends of declining audiences and reduced contributed and earned income, the future of supply-side policies becomes questionable. A case is made that demand-side policies may offer a more democratic way forward for both arts and sports policies. In addition, reference is made to a new online arts policy simulation, entitled ""Medici's Lever"", which provides a laboratory for testing alternative demand-side and supply-side policies. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","demand-side; logic model; Medici; National Endowment for the Arts; policy simulation; sports policy; supply-side; US arts policy",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Baumol, W.J., Bowen, W.G., (1966) The performing arts, the economic dilemma, , New York, NY, New York, NY,: Twentieth Century Fund; Kreidler, J., (1996) Leverage lost: The non-profit arts in the post-Ford era, , http://www.inmotionmagazine.com/lost.html, Retrieved from; Levine, L.W., (1988) Highbrow lowbrow: The emergence of cultural hierarchy in America, , Cambridge, MA, Cambridge, MA,: Harvard University Press; (2008) Survey of public participation in the arts, , http://www.nea.gov/research/2008-sppa.pdf, National Endowment for the Arts Retrieved from; (1997) The American Heritage College Dictionary, , Boston, MA, Boston, MA,: Houghton Mifflin, (3rd ed.)","Kreidler, J.; Cultural Initiatives Silicon Valley, San Jose, United States; email: jdkreidler@sbcglobal.net",,,,,,,,09548963,,,,"English","Cult.

This article aims to reveal the evolution of agency-wide macro-policy that was undertaken by NEA Chairs acting strategically as policy entrepreneurs in adapting policy goals in response to changes in the political and socio-economic context. This process of policy evolution gradually shaped and institutionalized a triple-bottom line for its organizational grantees - financial sustainability, artistic vitality, and recognized public value. Through legitimation processes in which the agency and the arts community cooperated, these values became field standards and best practices, a meta-policy that influenced all nonprofit arts organizations in the USA. Using policy documents, research reports, the memoirs of NEA chairmen, and journalistic coverage, this article investigates how cultural policy at the micro-, macro-, and meta-levels interacted to shape the triple-bottom line through the policy entrepreneurship of NEA chairs. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","artistic vitality; meta-policy; policy entrepreneur; public benefit; triple-bottom line",,,,,,"National Eczema Association","Under the leadership of Chair Nancy Hanks in the 1970s, new grant categories provided funding for major and developing arts organizations in the key disciplines of Theater, Dance, Music, and Museums. Each program established grants to fund seasonal support and organizational development; soon, a majority of the NEA’s rapidly growing budget came to be allocated to such organizational funding. In order to secure additional funds, Chair Hanks enlisted the advocacy efforts of a growing complement of arts service organizations, thus strengthening communication within the general arts community while placing the NEA at the hub of this emerging governance network (Wyszomirski, 1987). Since grants carried a matching requirement intended to help recipient organizations attract additional non-federal funding, this too stimulated a broader governance system.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Baumol, H., Baumol, W., (1985) Artistic deficit: Preliminary exploration of the availability of objective evidence, , Paper commissioned by the National Endowment for the Arts, Washington, DC; Biddle, L., (1988) Our government and the arts: A perspective from the inside, , New York, New York,: American Council for the Arts Books; Binkiewicz, D.M., (2004) Federalizing the muse: United States arts policy and the national endowment for the arts, 1965-1980, , Chapel Hill, NC, Chapel Hill, NC,: Duke University Press; Brenson, M., (2001) Visionaries and outcasts: The NEA, Congress, and the place of the visual artist in America, , New York, New York,: The New Press; Castaner, X., Campos, L., The determinants of artistic innovation: Bringing in the role of organizations (2002) Journal of Cultural Economics, 26, pp. 29-52. , doi:10.1023/A:1013386413465; Culbert, J., Keens, W.M., Lewis, L., Wolf, T., (1996) Rethinking stabilization: Strengthening arts organizations during times of change, , Cambridge, MA, Cambridge, MA,: Strategic Grantmaker Services; Elkington, J., (1997) Cannibals with forks: The triple bottom lines of 21st century business, , Oxford, Oxford,: Capstone; Gingold, D.J., (1980) The challenge grant experience, , Washington, DC, Washington, DC,: The National Endowment for the Arts, August; Greenaway, J., Salter, B., Hart, S., The evolution of a meta-policy: The case of the private finance initiative and the health sector (2004) British Journal of Political and International Relations, 6, pp. 507-526. , doi:10.1111/j.1467-856X.2004.00153.x; Hodsoll, F., The national endowment for the arts and cultural economics: The information partnership (1985) Journal of Cultural Economics, 9 (1), pp. 1-12. , doi:10.1007/BF02267485; Howlett, M., (2011) Designing public policies: Principles and instruments, , New York, New York,: Routledge; Kerr, P., Saved from extinction: Evolutionary theorising politics and the state (2002) The British Journal of Politics and International Relations, 4 (2), pp. 330-358. , doi:10.1111/1467-856X.t01-1-00008; Kingdon, J.W., (1995) Agendas, alternatives, and public policies, , 2, New York, NY, New York, NY,: HarperCollins College; Markusen, A., Gadwa, A., (2010) Creative placemaking, , NEA: MICD White Paper; McCarthy, K., Ondaatje, E.H., Zakaras, L., Brooks, A., (2004) Gifts of the muse: Reframing the debate about the benefits of the arts, , Santa Monica, CA, Santa Monica, CA,: Rand; (1984) Five-year planning document, 1986-1990, , NEA, Washington, DC, Washington, DC,: National Endowment for the Arts; (2000) The National Endowment for the Arts, 1965-2000: A brief chronology of federal support for the arts, , NEA, Washington, DC, Washington, DC,: NEA; (1978) Annual report, , NEA, 1982, 2002, 2008, 2010 Washington, DC, Washington, DC,: National Endowment for the Arts; Panozzo, F., (2011) Triple Bottom lines, standards, and balanced scorecards, , http://ssrn.com/abstract=1857544, Retrieved January 27, 2013, from; Rushefsky, M., (1995) Public policy in the United States: Toward the 21st century, , 2, Belmont, CA, Belmont, CA,: Wadsworth Publishing Company; Sabatier, P., Jenkins-Smith, H., (1993) Policy change and learning: An advocacy coalition approach, , In: Sabatier P., Jenkins-Smith H., editors Boulder, CO, Boulder, CO,: Westview Press; Schwartz, S., Peters, M., (1983) Growth of arts and cultural organizations in the decade of the 1970s, , Washington, DC, Washington, DC,: NEA; Stone, D., (1997) Policy paradox: The art of political decision making, , New York, New York,: W.W.

It aims to develop a nuanced and contemporary picture of cultural participation and notions of the non-user. In doing that, we show a shift in how the user has been constructed through surveys undertaken from 1964. Furthermore, the article addresses the problem that participatory culture does not necessarily take place within those institutions measured in cultural participation surveys. Therefore, surveys may indicate culturally active and contributing citizens as ""non-users"". The article concludes that societal development and mediatisation have created a multi-faceted and complex type of user. This demands a reconsideration of how surveys on cultural habits and participation are undertaken. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","non-users; participatory culture; surveys of cultural participation; users",,,,,,,"Ministry of Employment Council of Social Research Danish Television Danish Library Association Egmont H.

It does so in the context of current arts policy, which aims to rebalance arts participation patterns across localities. Such policies are grounded in particular forms of evidence of differentiated levels of participation, which indicate the position of places within league tables and indices of activities according to the ""volume and value"" of arts participation and engagement. However, these obscure other cultural practices related to a different understanding of places and their on-going production. The article argues that arts initiatives predicated on situated, vernacular and sometimes ostensibly mundane practices, often excluded from formal definitions of ""the arts"", can help such policies to negotiate local ""structures of feeling"" [Taylor, I., Evans, K., & Fraser, P. (1996). A tale of two cities - global change, local feeling and everyday life in the North of England. A study in Manchester and Sheffield. London: Routledge] and the multiple trajectories and stories of place, in order to engage those who do not usually attend or participate in the arts.

Through a qualitative analysis of a festival of new work at West Yorkshire Playhouse in Leeds, it explores the levers and barriers to participatory engagement and evaluates the phenomenon of co-creation from the comparative perspective of theatre producers and audiences. The rising trend of co-creation reflects the evolving role of the audience in the creative process. Co-creation is one of the most intensive ways audiences can engage with the arts, and this study questions to what extent it can be regarded as an authentic democratization of the creative process. The study takes a qualitative approach, based on participant observation and 12 in-depth interviews with a sample drawn from theatre-makers, managers, marketers and audiences. Its key findings are that co-creation attracts a highly niche audience of ""theatre people"" who are active learners and risk takers and that while an all-encompassing definition of co-creation remains elusive, the activity is here to stay. Co-creation is ultimately messy, raw, incomplete, contingent and context-dependent. Successful co-creation involves trust, respect, collaboration, playfulness and exchange; it takes participants on an adventurous journey and deepens their engagement with theatre. The implications of this study are as follows: producers and artists should engage authentically with participants and explore ways to develop their co-creative skills; marketers should utilize experiential marketing techniques to emphasize the different, fun, risky and edgy aspects of co-creation; and policymakers should not rely on co-creation to widen participation and democratize the arts, but accept that it can deepen engagement for a select few. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","artistic engagement; arts participation; co-creation; cultural value; relational art; theatre audiences",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Arvidsson, A., The ethical economy of customer coproduction (2008) Journal of Macromarketing, 28 (4), pp. 326-338. , doi:10.1177/0276146708326077; Bishop, C., (2006) Participation, , London, London,: Whitechapel; Boorsma, M., A strategic logic for arts marketing: Integrating customer value and artistic objectives (2006) The International Journal of Cultural Policy, 12 (1), pp. 73-92. , doi:10.1080/10286630600613333; Bourdieu, P., (1984) Distinction: A social critique of the judgement of taste (R.

The programme was slightly different from many ambassador schemes, where the emphasis is on ambassadors acting as a bridge between cultural sector and the wider public. This also aimed to use the champions as a community voice for culture to convince the city's wider governance of the value of, and interest in, culture locally. An integral part of the programme was a research strand, using focus groups, interviews, observation and a well-being measure to explore the champions' journeys and the impact of this experience on the champions' well-being. This paper reflects on the findings of this research in order to address some of the questions around Cultural Champions as a concept and mechanism to enhance engagement and participation in the arts. It concludes that Cultural Champions offer a challenge to the current participation agenda in offering the potential for a new role within the sector as critics and developers of new promotion and advocacy models. But, Cultural Champions also raise questions around sharing and ceding of power and authority in the cultural establishment. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","active citizens; champions; critic; cultural participation; well-being measurement",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"(2010) Achieving great art for everyone, , Arts Council England, London, London,: Author; Arnstein, S., A ladder of citizen participation (1969) Journal of the American Institute of Planners, 35 (4), pp. 216-224. , doi:10.1080/01944366908977225; (2012) Big society - overview, , http://www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/content/big-society-overview, Cabinet Office, Cabinet Office website.

These surveys have been used to create small area estimates of arts attendance. But other studies of the use of public facilities suggest that access to a venue would be highly predictive of attendance. This paper compares administrative data on opera attendance in London with small area estimates of opera audiences, and finds a systematic geographic bias in the errors of the predictions, related to a lack of information about the location of venues. It demonstrates that a model using 2001 Census data and a simple accessibility index better predicts attendance, and more accurately locates audiences. It concludes that, by focusing on individual-level explanations in order to understand cultural engagement, funders have failed to examine the effect of their own investment. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","accessibility index; administrative data; opera; segmentation; small area estimates",,,,,,"Economic and Social Research Council, ESRC: RES-187-24-0014",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"(2008) Arts-based segmentation research: Local area analysis, 2009. , ACE, London, London,: Arts Council England; (2008) Arts audiences: Insight, , ACE, London, London,: Arts Council England; (2008) Local level modelling of the segments: Technical note, , ACE, London, London,: Arts Council England; (2010) Arts attendance in England and Great Britain, 2009/10, , ACE, London, London,: Arts Council England; (2011) Area profile reports, , http://www.artscouncil.org.uk/about-us/guidance/area-profile-reports/, ACE.

However, what is not questioned is the extent to which this ""problem"" is an endogenous one that has taken shape within the policies that have been developed to tackle it. Utilising Bacchi's [(2009). Analysing policy: What's the problem represented to be?Frenchs Forest, NSW: Pearson] interpretive method for analysing and critiquing policy, this paper considers a range of Scottish cultural policy documents and the research that informed them in order to consider how the ""problem"" of non-participation is represented. It is argued that although the ""problem"" is represented in policy documents as the existence of barriers that create unequal access to culture, nested within this is a further, but less explicit difficulty, namely that the ""problem"" is the failure to engage with those cultural activities that receive state support. If the ""problem"" was understood as a need to provide equality of access to culture rather than state funded culture, then those who implement policy would be free to focus less on maximising access to those organisations and activities which, for other valid reasons, the Government funds, but that the majority of the public are not interested in attending. They would be able to think creatively, instead, about how to facilitate the deepening of an already present cultural democracy. The creation of Creative Scotland offers the potential to disrupt the extant problem representation, but only if it can transition from being the funder of ""legitimate"" culture to becoming the facilitators of an environment in which participants contribute to the legitimation of culture through their choices and opinions. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","barriers; Creative Scotland; cultural engagement; cultural participation; cultural policy; Scottish cultural policy",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Bacchi, C., (2009) Analysing policy: What's the problem represented to be?, , Frenchs Forest, NSW, Frenchs Forest, NSW,: Pearson; Barker, C., (2004) The SAGE dictionary of cultural studies, , London, London,: SAGE; (2012) Full: Open letter to Creative Scotland, , http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-19880680, BBC.

Existing approaches have traditionally attempted to define the meaning of art museums on the basis of the socio-economic composition of museum audiences. Using mixed methods analysis, with a particular stress on qualitative data about the audiences of the six main museums of modern and contemporary art in Belgium, I argue for the need for a more complex and comprehensive framework to understand visitors' perceptions. I show that people characterized by similar cultural tastes and practices use similar strategies to interpret their relationship to culture, art and museums (the same principles of classification, legitimation and justification). On this basis, I argue that those with a similar cultural profile belong to the same ""interpretive community"" (Fish, 1980; Hooper-Greenhill, 2000). © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","art; audiences; mixed method; museums; perceptions",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Atkinson, W., (2010) Class, individualization and late modernity: In search of the reflexive worker, , Basingstoke, Basingstoke,: Palgrave Macmillan; Baugard, D., Que savons-nous, en Belgique, des publics de nos musées?

It attempts to escape from the usual debate between the entertainment industries and the supporters of free culture, and to open the field for new perspectives. In Bulgaria it is precisely ""free"" as in ""free beer"" that matters, since the prices of cultural products tend to be too high for the Bulgarian market. In many cases, there is no possible legal access to the cultural products desired. The digital library ""Chitanka"" illustrates how piracy as bottom-up initiative compensates for the lack of successful public policies oriented towards visually impaired people and Bulgarian emigrants abroad. Although mobility and de-territorialisation have made piracy possible, it is perceived as a deeply national cause. The article emphasises that a difference should be made between open non-commercial projects as ""Chitanka"" and commercial torrent trackers, which thrive in the grey economy and abuse the symbolic capital of free culture. Piracy should be analysed at the intersections of global economic shifts and their local repercussions, of transnational culture flows and local culture infrastructure. Only this kind of an approach is likely to help us trace the unstable border between the cases in which digital piracy is a problem of the grey economy, and those in which it offers original non-market solutions to deeper structural problems. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","access; Bulgaria; digital piracy; free culture; grey economy; torrent trackers",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"(2011) Russian Source, , http://www.facebook.com/pages/(RussianSource)/118414181511025, Against shutting, (Russian Source)small hard sign}m(Russian Source)Retrieved October 22, 2011, from; (2012) Alexa: Top sites in Bulgaria, , http://www.alexa.com/topsites/countries/BG, Alexa, Retrieved October 22, 2011, from; (2010) Russian Source, , http://www.dnevnik.bg/bulgaria/2010/04/29/894295_antimafiotite_zatvariat_zamunda_i_arena/, Antimafia, (Russian Source)Retrieved October 22, 2011, from; Castells, M., (2010) The rise of network society, , (2nd ed.).

A common theme that emerges is the emphasis on the need to create a planning process for ""placemaking"" purposes. However, the definition of what a place is remains vague. Using administrative boundaries, this study draws a framework that formulates an operational definition of place that helps to connect spaces to empirical data about their cultural resources and residents. The focus on administrative boundaries is particularly relevant to understand American cities whose territories have a tangled morphology. Using Geographical Information System, this framework is then applied to assess the current situation in Madison, Wisconsin. The results suggest that the use of this framework could help policy makers to assess the texture of their territory in its administrative, cultural and social dimensions. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","cities; cultural planning; Geographical Information System; local authorities; placemaking",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Adams, D., Goldbard, A., (2001) Creative community: The art of cultural development, , New York, NY, New York, NY,: Rockfeller Foundation; (2005) Local arts agency facts: Fiscal year 2003 (Report), , Americans for the Arts, Washington, DC, Washington, DC,: Author; Ashworth, G.J., Voogd, H., (1990) Selling the city: Marketing approaches in public sector urban planning, , London, New York, NY, London, New York, NY,: Belhaven Press; (2008) Creative city planning framework, , AuthentiCity, Toronto, Toronto,: City of Toronto; Baeker, G., (2010) Rediscovering the wealth of places: A municipal planning handbook for Canadian communities, , St. Thomas, Ontario, St. Thomas, Ontario,: Municipal World, Inc; Bauer, R., (1966) Social indicators, , Cambridge, MA, Cambridge, MA,: MIT Press; Bianchini, F., Cultural planning: An innovative approach to urban development (1996) Managing urban change, pp. 18-25. , In J.

After considerable investment in developing the sector's research infrastructure in the past decade, evidence continues to play a symbolic role in English cultural policy. This article aims to contribute to our understanding of whether and how evidence plays a role in policy making. It assumes that evidence by itself does not influence policy. Instead, experts in the production and interpretation of such evidence have the agency to attempt to exert power or to influence decisions. The article explores how a group of evidence experts used CASE as a way of turning their expertise into expert power in the English cultural sector.

CASE was funded jointly with the Arts Council England, English Heritage, Museums, Libraries and Archives Council and Sport England. To bring these five bodies together to invest jointly in research meant the focus of that research had to appeal to all. The common denominator was ""engagement"". Internal analysis of the fundamental evidence requirements resulted in a three-way framing of the issue: what drives engagement, what is the impact of that engagement and how do we value it for economic appraisal. This led directly to the £0.5 million Understanding the Drivers, Impacts and Value of Engagement in Culture and Sport project in 2009-2010. We also built on the success of the CASE database to bring together a wide range of data under the banner of ""Regional and Local Insights"" giving researchers and policy analysts much easier access to a wider range of data than ever before. With the new administration's focus on reducing subsidy to the cultural sector, CASE now turns its gaze to the supply side of cultural policy, to understand what keeps organisations going. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","civil service; culture; Culture and Sport Evidence; policy research; sport",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Achieving great art for everyone (2010) A strategic framework for the arts, , http://www.artscouncil.org.uk/media/uploads/achieving_great_art_for_everyone.pdf, Retrieved from; Bourdieu, P., The forms of capital (1986) Handbook for theory and research for the sociology of education, pp. 241-258. , In: Richardson J.

It employs multiple correspondence analysis to look at the clustering of participation using data from the ""Taking Part"" survey and uses qualitative material from participation narratives to address the meanings attached to participation and cultural engagement. The authors show that contemporary lifestyles are strongly demarcated around both the fact and the nature of participation and that the clustering of particular types of activity and inactivity shows quite clearly that not taking part in highbrow cultural activities is the norm. They go on to argue that the ""deficit"" model of culture employed by government is unhelpful, as what matters for health and well-being appears to be participation per se and that more work is therefore required to understand the value and significance of informal and everyday cultural practices. Nevertheless, given the continuing role of culture in the inter-generational transmission of economic and social inequalities, they also call for policies to promote cultural ""omnivorousness"" and tackle disengagement. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","cultural participation; deficit model; everyday cultural practices; multiple correspondence analysis; omnivore thesis",,,,,,,"6.

The methods conventionally relied on by economists to estimate these values are, however, subject to a number of limitations, both methodological and philosophical. Given these concerns, economists have identified alternative valuation methods, such as the use of subjective well-being (SWB) measures. SWB measures hold much promise, but face a number of challenges before they can generate policy relevant outcomes. This article illustrates these challenges by applying the SWB approach to the valuation of engagement in culture. An analysis of the British Household Panel Survey is undertaken to estimate the value of going to the cinema and attending concerts. The approach was divided into two steps. First, the SWB impact of engaging in culture was estimated. Both fixed effects and random effects models were employed, and an instrumental variable was used to control for the endogeneity of income. Second, the value of engagement was estimated as the income compensation (IC) that would generate an SWB impact equivalent to engaging in culture. Both the impact of engagement in culture on SWB and the corresponding IC are thought to be overestimates. Possible explanations for this are considered to illustrate the research that is required before the SWB approach can generate rigorous estimates of value that are useful to policy makers. First, further research is required on the relationship between income and SWB, including methods for dealing with the direct and indirect impact of income on SWB. Second, further work is required to develop reliable instrumental. Third, work is required to understand the temporal relationship between policy outcomes and SWB. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","culture; economic evaluation; method; subjective well-being; valuation",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Arrow, K.J., (1974) The limits of organisation, , New York, NY, New York, NY,: Norton; Arrow, K.J., Solow, R., Portney, P., Leamer, E.E., Radner, R., Shuman, H., Report of the NOAA Panel on Contingent Valuation (1993) Federal Register, 58, pp. 4602-4614; (1997) Study into the employment effects of Arts Lottery spending in England (Research Rep.

Based on a comprehensive review of the arts management and cultural policy literature, it contests recent claims that the cultural sector should state its value in the economic language of policy appraisal and evaluation (O'Brien, 2010) and proposes alternative methods for evaluating the drivers, impact and value of engagement in the arts, including the balanced scorecard approach. The literature identifies a number of fundamental problems in quantifying the social and personal impact of the arts, and an underlying policy issue is that the arts have become increasingly subject to the benchmarks of incompatible disciplines and practices. This article seeks to redress the balance by questioning the argument that economic cost-benefit analysis is the best way to understand cultural value and influence public policy. As the CASE programme aimed to make the business case for optimum Government investment in sport and culture, it adopted the framework set out in HM Treasury's Green Book and took a quantitative, evidence-based approach to measuring the drivers, impact and instrumental value of engagement, disregarding established qualitative studies and approaches, which have been shown to articulate cultural value through a more personal, intrinsic and holistic lens. This article makes the case for a more balanced approach to cultural evaluation and a more holistic articulation of cultural value, which would combine intrinsic and instrumental benefits and comprise both qualitative and quantitative methods.

Influenced by a neoliberal paradigm that emphasises market philosophy in the provision of public services, including arts and culture, mixed-funding economy is being acclaimed as an ideal, in that it depends on private funds to supplement public funds. It is often even claimed that private funds constitute a substitute for the lack of public support. Neoliberal cultural policy discourse, implemented through the instrumentalisation of culture, is based primarily on the use value of culture. In the present economic crisis, when all existing concepts come under question and when available empirical data show that private funding of culture is decreasing, many voices are calling for a rethinking of cultural policy. We show that private investment in culture is not unrelated to state support, and furthermore, that they are not even necessarily private, in the sense of pure market mechanisms. We suggest that they are driven by non-use values, and are therefore much more ""public"" than commonly thought and we provide arguments in favour of state support for the development of such mechanisms. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","contingent valuation; cultural sector; externalities; non-use values; private investment; public goods",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Arrow, K., Solow, R., Portney, P.R., Leamer, E.E., Radner, R., Schuman, H., (1993) Report of the NOAA Panel on contingent valuation, , http://www.darrp.noaa.gov/library/pdf/cvblue.pdf; Bille Hansen, T., The willingness-to-pay for the Royal Theatre in Copenhagen as a public good (1997) Journal of Cultural Economics, 21, pp. 1-28; Boorsma, P., Privatizing the muse ""and all the jazz"" (1998) Privatization and culture: Experiences in arts, heritage and cultural industries in Europe, pp. 23-45. , In: Boorsma P.

However, the lack of systematized information regarding these formations, together with the unstable and multivocal nature of the term ""culture"" and the network form suggests the need for new critical approaches. This paper presents a research framework for the study of region-specific cultural network ecosystems. The framework addresses an emerging politics of relationality among arts and cultural organizations and the processes through which these groups perceive and construct new notions of togetherness, as they attempt to move past old practices of grassroots governance. Three case studies of cultural networks in Latin America are used to illustrate how cultural networks function as domains for social action, vehicles for the construction of ""futurity"" and meaning structures that engineer new social relations. This paper considers key artefacts in the study of cultural networks, and presents transdisciplinarity as a pedagogical form employed by cultural networks in an effort to learn autonomously and share critical practices today. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","civil society; cultural networks; cultural policy; Latin America; technology, arts",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Appadurai, A., (1996) Modernity at large: Cultural dimensions of globalization, , Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press; Benkler, Y., (2007) The wealth of networks: How social production transforms markets and freedom, , New Haven: Yale University Press; Bradford, G., Gary, M., Wallach, G., (2000) The politics of culture?: Policy perspectives for individuals, institutions, and communities, , New York: The New Press; Brun, J., Benito, J., Canut, P., (2008) Redes culturales.

This way, the paper reflects on the usefulness of the main data source used to understand cultural activity within Scotland. There are general difficulties measuring ""culture"", but overall the SHS provides adequate national data for Scotland on cultural participation and attendance. However, the SHS cannot provide in-depth local level information and provides limited data on non-participants. Other surveys in Scotland and England give some example practices that could be incorporated to improve survey outcomes.

Yet, resorting to instrumental arguments to defend the arts and to make a case for their usefulness is hardly an invention of New Labour. However, in the past, such defensive arguments were built into a more constructive and creative attempt to elaborate a coherent theory of art and an intellectually sophisticated view of the effects of the arts on individual and societies. What the paper argues, then, is that instrumentalism under New Labour has retained its longstanding defensive character, but was deprived of the attendant effort to elaborate a positive notion of cultural value. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","British cultural policy; instrumentalism; New Labour; social impact",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Abrams, M.H., (1953) The mirror and the lamp: Romantic theory and the critical tradition, , Oxford: Oxford University Press; Belfiore, E., Art as a means towards alleviating social exclusion: Does it really work?

This is an explanatory study employing Multiple Correspondence Analysis as a method to map the cultural consumption patterns in Finland. The paper refers to a number of previous studies addressing the same issue in Denmark and particularly the UK in an attempt to place the results within a comparison framework. The main argument of this paper is not simply that within socio-economic groups there is a preference for similar culture, but that cultural preferences follow a structure over different domains that can be detected without reference to socio-economic factors. As a result of the analysis, two dimensions of the MCA solution are found, which represent differentiations between high engagement in culture versus disengagement and contemporary versus traditional forms of culture. These dimensions are very similar to the dimensions found in the UK, even if the placement of individual cultural activities varies somewhat. The applicability of the Bourdieusian approach to cultural differences between classes, as well as recent critical developments of the theory of distinction, will be discussed in light of the results. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","Bourdieu; class; cultural capital; multiple correspondence analysis",,,,,,"Academy of Finland: SA 2006-1114819

Drawing upon a project of the Finnish Ministry of Education, the article discusses the responsibilities of official statisticians in regard to the collection and processing of data to be used as ""evidence"" of the outcomes of cultural policies. Official statisticians are bound by an ethical code that emphasises the objective and independent production of information on different aspects of the economy and society. Direct involvement with the construction of cultural policy indicators may threaten the integrity of official statisticians, because such work would require close collaboration with administrators and decision makers who have their own particular interests in the cultural field. Moreover, the system of cultural statistics, which was established internationally at the turn of the 1970s, has a history of providing justification for public cultural policies. The Finnish project, in which two officials from Statistics Finland functioned in the role of commissioned experts, was officially about societal effectiveness indicators but was extended to encompass arguments for cultural policy. The final report even went as far as to propose that cultural considerations could be mainstreamed through indices and evaluation schemes covering all policy sectors. The article shows how easily official statisticians are drawn into the politics of data collection in the field of culture even when precautions are in place. The article concludes that the code of ethics of official statisticians serves as an indispensable buffer against partiality, but, to put this ideal fully into action, cultural statisticians need to develop reflexive practices that combine an applied approach and critical discourse. Such practices are similar to those outlined recently by cultural policy researchers. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","critical practice; cultural statistics; evidence; performance management; policy indicators; societal effectiveness; statistical ethics",,,,,,,"At Statistics Finland, the indicator project taught us to be extremely cautious when dealing closely with any particular interest group, including fellow government agencies. At the same time, it highlighted the importance of widening user consultation in developing the statistical domain, which is also required by the principles of official statistics. Reflecting the earlier funding model, the steering group for cultural statistics continues to consist of representatives solely from the Ministry of Education and Statistics Finland. It is evident, however, that the group would benefit from the addition of representatives from cultural policy research, the humanities and cultural studies, arts and culture institutions and information centres, and possibly the media as well.","The Ministry of Education will have to determine how and by whom the much desired “mediation” between data collection and policy making can best be achieved. This is not a suitable task for the national statistical office, whose role is to continue as a provider of baseline statistics on the cultural field. As one solution to the problem of mediation, the Ministry established a policy analysis group in 2008 to assist in strategic action. Another central actor is Cupore, the Finnish Foundation for Cultural Policy Research, established in 2002. Funded chiefly by the Ministry, the Foundation maintains a research centre whose task it is to monitor, initiate, disseminate and carry out policy-relevant research. In my view, the development and interpretation of actual policy indicators nevertheless calls for policy analysts who would make explicitly political assessments. This would clarify the division of responsibilities in the provision of cultural policy information, and I believe that it would also make the process of indicator construction more transparent and open to democratic discussion.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"(2009) National arts index 2009, , http://www.americansforthearts.org/pdf/information_services/art_index/NAI_full_report_print_quality.pdf, Americans for the Arts, Retrieved from; (2008) Arts and cultural heritage in Australia: Key issues for an information development plan, , http://www.ausstats.abs.gov.au/Ausstats/subscriber.nsf/0/8E1DEAAAC5A70BAECA25740B0010D75D/$File/4915055002_2008.pdf, Australian Bureau of Statistics, (Discussion paper).

The paper outlines New Labour's developing approach to culture-led regeneration, placing the UKCC in the context of the use of culture for various local development policies, particularly city branding and urban regeneration (Evans & Shaw, 2004; McGuigan, 2005). Within this context, the paper considers how Liverpool's year as European Capital of Culture (ECoC) 2008 has been narrated by New Labour and the manner in which this narrative has influenced the development of the UKCC programme (Department for Culture, Media and Sport [DCMS], 2009; Garcia, Melville & Cox, 2010). The paper demonstrates how this narrative overlooks the ultimate specificity of Liverpool's success (Liverpool Culture Company, 2009; Garcia et al., 2010), which suggests a unique combination of political circumstance, cultural leadership and public and private investment are at the root of the perceived success of Liverpool's ECoC 2008, rather than an exportable, replicable policy (O'Brien & Miles, 2010) described by the policy literature, and substantiated by the competition to select the UKCC 2013 (DCMS, 2009). The paper's conclusion problematises the prospect of another city repeating the Liverpool experience. The ""Liverpool model"" of culture-led regeneration is shown as one which limits prospective cultural policies to a narrow vision of the possible, a vision which is unlikely to be sustainable in the foreseeable future. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","city branding; culture-led urban regeneration; European Capital of Culture; Liverpool 08; local development policies; urban regeneration",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Bailey, C., Miles, S., Stark, P., Culture led urban regeneration and the revitalisation of identities in Newcastle, Gateshead and the North East of England (2004) International Journal of Cultural Policy, 10 (1), pp. 47-65; Belchem, J., (2006) Liverpool 800 culture, character, history, , In: Belchem J., editors Liverpool: Liverpool University Press; Belfiore, E., Bennett, O., (2008) The social impact of the arts: An intellectual history, , Basingstoke: Palgrave/Macmillan; Bianchini, F., Urban renaissance?

This follows increased demand for an informed framework for planning arts and cultural facilities from local and regional government and from within the cultural sector (Evans, 2008: p. 65). The article begins with an exploration of cultural mapping within cultural policy, which explores the context for the growth in this area of activity, and why this kind of activity appeals to policy makers and organisations. It then goes on to examine four cultural mapping exercises which have been undertaken in recent years in the UK. These studies have been chosen because although they all focus the mapping of cultural assets within a specific geographic area, they differ to one degree or another in purpose, context, definition, geographic scale and methodology. They illustrate the narrow range of approaches deployed in the cultural mapping field in the UK, and as such provide a useful means of critically reviewing their limits as well as highlighting the issues and challenges faced by cultural cartography in practice. The article concludes by considering the type of mapping research that is ""allowed"" within the discursive confines of consultancy based cultural policy research. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","cultural mapping; cultural planning; cultural significance; evidence based policy; housing growth areas",,,,,,"American College of Endocrinology, ACE",".

The distinction model asserts a hierarchical classification of tastes and genre and an aesthetic judgment based on rejection. In the musical field, Richard A. Peterson challenged the model showing the eclectism and the mix of classical and popular genres among the tastes of elite. Changes in taste judgements in multicultural societies problematise the understanding and representation of the structuration of tastes. In reference to the 2008 statistical survey on French cultural practices and tastes, this article challenges conventional understandings of the taste patterns informing music consumption in contemporary France. In doing this, the article utilises a 'tablature of tastes' model which infers the incommensurability of musical genres and taste judgments no longer based on ""rejections/dislikes"" but rather on ""openness/tolerance"" or ""indifference/ignorance"". Our analysis tests the ""tablatures"" of musical likes, dislikes and indifferences hypothesis within the French population through a factor and classification analysis method. Six classes of musical taste emerge with a limited share of dislikes and a strong age differentiation. It confirms a major transformation in judgments of taste in the musical field. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","aesthetic judgment; distinction; music; tablature; taste",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Bennett, A., (2001) Cultures of popular music, , Buckingham: Open University Press; Bennett, T., Savage, M., Silva, E.B., Warde, A., Gayo-Cal, M., Wright, D., (2009) Culture, class, distinction, , In: Bennett T., Savage M., Silva E.

For the first time in the cultural field, we use a multilevel logistic model to examine whether place matters after accounting for individual characteristics and area level compositional factors. Our findings show that the traditional social order remains intact, although other social cleavages have become important, and that significant variation exists in museum participation simultaneously at both the neighbourhood and local authority district spatial scales. We conclude by arguing that future research into cultural consumption patterns must take account of the fact that individuals reside in different places. That individuals cluster in space, interact in these places and spaces, and that environmental forces impact on museum participation. Put simply, both theoretically and empirically, studies of cultural behaviour should take account of place, because place matters. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","multilevel modelling; museum participation; place; stratification",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Agnew, J.A., (1987) Place and politics: The geographical mediation of state and society, , Boston, MA: Allen & Unwin; Bennett, T., Savage, M., Silva, E., Warde, A., Gayo-Cal, M., Wright, D., (2009) Culture, class, distinction, , Abingdon: Routledge; Blasius, J., Friedrichs, J., Lifestyles in distressed neighbourhoods: A taste of Bourdieu's ""taste of necessity"" hypothesis (2008) Poetics, 36, pp. 24-44; Blau, J., (1989) The shape of culture: A study of contemporary cultural patterns in the United States, , New York, NY: Cambridge University Press; Blau, J., The elite arts, more or less de rigueur: A comparative analysis of metropolitan culture (1986) Social Forces, 64 (4), pp. 875-905; Bourdieu, P., (1984) Distinction: A social critique of the judgement of taste, , London: Routledge; Buck, N., Identifying neighbourhood effects on social exclusion (2001) Urban Studies, 38 (12), pp. 2251-2275; Chan, T., Goldthorpe, J., The social stratification of theatre, dance and cinema attendance (2005) Cultural Trends, 14, pp. 193-212; Chan, T., Goldthorpe, J., Social stratification and cultural consumption: Music in England (2007) European Sociological Review, 23 (1), pp. 1-19; Curtis, S., Rees-Jones, I., Is there a place for geography in the analysis of health inequality?

One group of respondents attended two ""meet the artist talks"" and a second group attended an artist-led workshop where they produced work that had been stimulated by the exhibition. The focus groups that resulted were analysed using theoretical frameworks related to identity construction. The analysis demonstrated that respondents were using the resources of the exhibition to construct identity positions in response to their social contexts. However, their ability to do this was governed by how the relationship between agency and structure played out for individuals in their engagement with contemporary visual art.

Using data from 1981/82 to 2008/09, we investigate whether funding patterns in these two sectors behave differently in response to changes in economic growth. We also explore whether and how these responses are influenced by factors such as the type of local authority in which these organisations operate. The paper finds differences between and within these sectors in terms of their responsiveness to changes in government expenditure. The chosen period of analysis allows for comparisons during two periods of cultural policy in England: two Conservative governments until 1997 and the New Labour era. Our findings are of policy relevance as cultural organisations in most Western economies are once again facing significant funding cuts and a new wave of requests from funders for more sustainable funding diversification strategies. © 2011 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","crowding out; diversification; economic growth; government funding; funding; libraries; Museums",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Andreoni, J., Payne, A., (2010) Is crowding out due entirely to fundraising?

However, the funding landscape for the arts and heritage has recently been challenged as market forces are putting pressure both on the public purse and the private sector's levels of investment. The financial year of 2008/09 brought the first real impact of the recession on culture, with a moderate 7 per cent decrease of private investment across the board (from business, individuals and trusts and foundations). This was followed by another smaller decrease in 2009/10 of 3 per cent. However, within these headline figures are hidden several parallel stories and trends - indicators such as region, artform and size of organisation directly affect the nature and scope of private investment received, which we explore in more depth. Based on Arts & Business' annual Private Investment in Culture survey, the paper will provide an analysis of private investment received by the sector, exploring where it is coming from and going to. This will be complemented by year-on-year comparisons, which will also enable an assessment of the impact of the recession on private investment in arts and heritage, and the challenges they will be facing in a post-recession economy and with a new government. Additional and contextual information about the past, present and future state of arts and heritage and their relationship with the private sector will highlight the potential for this income source going forward, as well as ongoing and upcoming trends in light of the recession and beyond. These will respectively feed into policy recommendations for any future government, and suggestions for cultural organisations to collectively emerge from the recession as a stronger and more sustainable sector. © 2011 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","business investment; individual giving; private investment; tripod economy; trusts and foundations",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"(2010) Achieving great art for everyone, , Arts Council England, London: ACE; Breeze, B., (2010) The Coutts million pound donors report 2010, , Canterbury: University of Kent; Forgan, D.L., Don't make the arts resort to begging bowls (2010) London Evening Standard, , http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/standard/article-23810139-dont-make-the-arts-resort-to-begging-bowls.do, Retrieved from; (2008) Business models and financial instruments for the museums, libraries and archives sector: Review of the literature and survey results, , Fresh Minds, London: Museums, Libraries and Archives Council; Gilmore, J., Mermiri, T., Pine, J., (2009) Beyond experience: Culture, consumer and brand, , London: Arts & Business; (2009) Tomorrow's philanthropist, , Ledbury Research, London: Barclays Wealth; Mermiri, T., (2010) Private investment in culture 2008/09: The arts in the ""new normal"", , London: Arts & Business; Mermiri, T., (2010) Arts philanthropy: The facts, trends and potential, , London: Arts & Business; (2010) UK giving 2010: An overview of charitable giving in the UK, 2009/10, , National Council for Voluntary Organisations/Charities Aid Foundation, London: Author","Mermiri, T.; Ipsos MORIUnited Kingdom; email: tinamermiri@gmail.com",,,,,,,,09548963,,,,"English","Cult.

The idea of ""creative industries"" embodied a set of assumptions about the changing nature of work which had been central to New Labour's reinvention during its years in the wilderness under Margaret Thatcher. Dubbed ""post-Fordist socialism"" by Thompson, the premise of many creative industry support initiatives was that the kind of work they provided was inherently progressive, combining demand for high skills with notions of self-expression and determination, in a workplace that was no longer hierarchical, but collaborative, flexible, even fun. Yet empirical evidence from the New Labour period suggests that the assumptions of inherently progressive work are largely unfounded. The cultural labour market remains polarised by gender, ethnicity and social class. Despite high levels of graduates, wages were low, and combined with the practice of unpaid ""internships"", and highly informal recruitment practices, class-based exclusion, often reflected in ethnicity, was a defining feature of the sector.The paper thus provides both a historical account of New Labour ideas about work and how they shaped public policy, and a contemporary account of policy initiatives around workforce entry. Its aim is to interrogate the assumptions and limitations of New Labour's ""creative workforce"", and through this, its wider policies on work, culture and social exclusion. © 2011 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","creative industries; cultural work; labour markets; New Labour; precarity",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Amin, A., (1994) Post-Fordism, , Oxford: Blackwell; Banks, M., (2007) The politics of cultural work, , Basingstoke: Palgrave MacMillan; Banks, M., Hesmondhalgh, D., Looking for work in creative industries policy (2009) International Journal of Cultural Policy, 15 (4), pp. 415-429; Barry, B., (2005) Why social justice matters, , Cambridge: Polity Press; Becker, G., (1964) Human capital: A theoretical and empirical analysis, with special reference to education, , Chicago, IL: University of Chicago Press; Benn, M., New Labour and social exclusion (2000) Political Quarterly, 79, pp. 309-318; Bennett, T., Putting policy into cultural studies (1992) Cultural studies, pp. 23-33. , In: Grosberg L., Nelson C., Treichler P., editors London: Routledge; Bevir, M., (2005) New Labour: A critique, , London: Routledge; Bianchini, F., GLC R.I.P (1987) New Formations 1981-1986, 1, pp. 103-117; Blond, P., (2009) The ownership state, , London: National Endowment for Science, Technology and the Arts; (2009) Unleashing aspiration: The final report on fair access to the professions, , Cabinet Office, London: Cabinet Office; Clarke, J., (2004) A consuming public?, , (April) Lecture in ESRC/AHRB Cultures of Consumption Series, Royal Society, London; Clarke, J., New Labour's citizens: Activated, empowered, responsibilised or abandoned?

First, the types of project and role undertaken by contemporary craft makers are investigated, with a focus on makers who adopt portfolio working patterns. Identified trends include role diversification and an increasing embeddedness within creative industry supply chains, with makers increasingly providing services as well as products and working to supply other businesses as well as consumers. Second, the distinctive contribution made by makers working in this way is analysed, and the centrality of craft knowledge, skills and working practices to innovation, user-centred design and the creation of expressive value is asserted. The value of portfolio working as a business strategy is articulated both in terms of enhancing makers' commercial sustainability and creative growth, and of producing significant contributions for industries including architecture and design, tourism and heritage, advertising and events, and film and television.Third, factors influencing makers' successful adoption of portfolio working patterns are identified, with new recognition given to the valuing of creative dynamics between collaborative and solo working, and between different elements of a portfolio practice. Tensions and challenges for portfolio working makers are also elicited, with the need to achieve an appropriate balance between opportunity, income generation and creative focus identified as a critical challenge for many. The influence of public investment in higher education and professional development programmes under the New Labour government is considered, in the context of a changing UK political climate. As craft, design and the wider cultural sector respond to economic, social and political change, the paper provides a timely analysis of shifting patterns of work and creativity in transition to a new era. © 2011 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","craft knowledge; craft; design; creative industries; cultural production; cultural workforce",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Bruce, A., Filmer, P., (1983) Working in crafts, , London: Crafts Council; Bunnell, K., Marshall, J., Developments in post industrial manufacturing systems and the implications for craft and sustainability Paper presented at the Making Futures Conference, Plymouth College of Art; Clinton, M., Totterdell, P., Wood, S.J., A grounded theory of portfolio working: Experiencing the smallest of small businesses (2006) International Small Business Journal, 24, pp. 179-203; (2009) The craft blueprint: A workforce development plan for craft in the UK, , Creative and Cultural Skills, London: Author; Dormer, P., Craft and the Turing Test for practical thinking (1997) The culture of craft, , In: Dormer P., editors Manchester: Manchester University Press; (2010) European Competitiveness Report 2010, , http://snipurl.com/eucompetitiveness, European Union Commission, (Commission Staff Work Document, Brussels) Retrieved from; Fry, T., Sacred design 1 (1995) Discovering design ability: Explorations in design studies, , In: Buchanan R., Margolin V., editors Chicago, IL: University of Chicago Press; Handy, C., (2002) The age of unreason, 2. , London: Arrow; Hunt, W., Ball, L., Pollard, E., (2010) Crafting futures: A study of the early careers of crafts graduates from UK higher education institutions, , London: Institute for Employment Studies/University of the Arts London/Crafts Council; Johnson, P., Out of touch: The meaning of making in the digital age (1997) Obscure objects of desire (Reviewing the crafts in the twentieth century), , In T.

However, a decade later the Arts Council England (ACE)'s mission statement of ""Great art for everyone"" suggested a continued emphasis on access to mainstream culture rather than on cultural democracy. The argument in this paper is that Labour's vision has resulted in little change to the basis upon which arts institutions receive regular funding, or the social composition of those who participate in the arts in Britain today - who remain predominantly white and middle class. Public consultation through The arts debate provides evidence that the arts are still perceived as elitist, and policy too insular and self-reflective. The report clearly identified the public's desire for not only greater transparency in decisionmaking processes but also involvement in the decisions themselves, in order to democratise the arts. This paper draws on research investigating the extent to which participatory decisionmaking schemes affect cultural democracy and the subsequent impact on artistic policy and practice. In addition to documentary analysis, this study involved interviews with policymakers, practitioners and the public, focusing on two projects using participatory decision-making in England. © 2011 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","artistic practice; cultural democracy; cultural policy; engagement; participation; participatory budgeting",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"(2009) Annual review 2008, , Arts Council England, London: Arts Council; Blakey, H., (2009) Fairness in participatory decision making, , www.participatorybudgeting.org.uk, Retrieved from; Braden, S., (1978) Artists and people, , London: Routledge; Brodie, E., Cowling, E., Nissen, N., (2009) Understanding participation: A literature review, , www.pathwaysthroughparticipation.org.uk, Retrieved from; Bunting, C., Chan, T.W., Goldthorpe, J., Keaney, E., Oskala, A., (2008) From indifference to enthusiasm: Patterns of arts attendance in England, , London: Arts Council; (2003) Slicing up the pie: Community involvement in participatory budgeting, Porto Alegre, Brazil, , www.participatorybudgeting.org.uk, Community Pride Initiative, Retrieved from; Cooke, B., Kothari, U., (2001) Participation: The new tyranny, , London: Zed Books; (2008) Participatory budgeting: A draft national strategy, , Department of Communities and Local Government, London: Communities and Local Government Publications; (2008) Technical Note NI11, , www.culture.gov.uk/images/publications/Technical_Note_NI11_FINAL.pdf, Department for Culture, Media and Sport, Retrieved from; (2011) Taking part survey: The national survey of culture, leisure and sport, , Department for Culture, Media and Sport, London: Author; Fairclough, N., (2000) New Labour, new language, , London: Routledge; Fennell, E., Gavelin, K., Jackson, R., (2009) Participatory budgeting and the arts, , London: Involve; Frayling, C., (2005) ""The only trustworthy book..."": Art and public value, , London: Arts Council England; Hatzihrysidis, M., Bunting, C., (2009) Public value programme: A wider range of voices, , Unpublished report, Arts Council England; Hewison, R., (1997) Culture and consensus, , England, art and politics since 1940.

It explores the rhetoric of ""creativity"" that dominated the New Labour government's cultural policy discourse, and argues that while the promotion of the creative industries and of the economic contribution of culture strengthened the hand of the Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) in attracting resources, there was a price to pay, in the form of auditing, that proved ultimately hostile to creativity. With its main focus on the English region, the paper reviews New Labour's institutional reforms and substantial investment in the cultural infrastructure, but argues that the competing claims of ""access"" and ""excellence"" remained unresolved, while policymakers failed to respond to the rapid technological developments in ""unofficial"" culture. © 2011 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","access; Blair; Brown; Chris Smith; creative industries; creativity; excellence; New Labour; public funding; UK cultural policy",,,,,,"National Endowment for Science Technology and the Arts, NESTA","The potentially most interesting institution born of the 1998 Lottery Act was the National Endowment for Science, Technology and the Arts (NESTA), imaginatively funded by a Lottery endowment, whose very title articulated the creativity agenda.

While it is widely acknowledged in the literature that careers in the creative field tend to be unstructured, often relying on part-time work and low wages, our knowledge of how these characteristics differ across the creative industries and occupational sectors is very limited. The paper explores the different trajectory and career patterns experienced by graduates in different creative disciplinary fields and their ability to enter creative occupations. Data from the Higher Education Statistical Agency (HESA) are presented, articulating a complex picture of the reality of finding a creative occupation for creative graduates. While students of some disciplines struggle to find full-time work in the creative economy, for others full-time occupation is the norm. Geography plays a crucial role also in offering graduates opportunities in creative occupations and higher salaries. The findings are contextualised in the New Labour cultural policy framework and conclusions are drawn on whether the creative industries policy construct has hidden a very problematic reality of winners and losers in the creative economy. © 2011 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","""Bohemian"" graduates; creative industries; creative work; higher education; human capital",,,,,,"Department for Employment and Learning, Northern Ireland, DEL, NI

We examine the processes related to three new building constructions for national, public museums in Estonia, Hungary and Croatia through Henry Lefebvre's theory of the production of space. The architecture of new museum buildings is seen as an outcome of historical, economic and social processes that have grown out of the recent past of the three countries. We examine these museums in the context of their multi-faceted locations, ranging from the suburbs to the new city centres, and the plans for their establishment in the context of privatization, urbanization and rapid internationalization of markets. The social space of the museum depends on the combination of the different actors involved in its production - public authorities, market actors and civil society and their relationship to one another. New museums in Central and Eastern Europe are, thus, regarded as monuments that also, inevitably, relate to the construction of new narratives of identities and statehood. © 2011 Taylor & Francis.","Central and Eastern Europe; Museum architecture; Museum boom; Spatial politics; Urban regeneration",,,,,,,"1.

Predominantly established during the 1970s, they have been founded by artist collectives typically operating within urban contexts, with the aim of providing new opportunities to cope with the physical, economic and cultural constraints that generally impede the professional development of artists. A remarkable urban environment in which it is possible to find, and study, a large number of such organizations is the city of Montreal, in the Quebec Province of Canada, which constitutes an excellent reference to track the onset and the evolution of independent artist-run spaces, and to understand why, how and to what extent they are currently experiencing new pressures and challenges, both on the internal and external sides. This article offers an empirical study of these organizations with reference to their organizational, managerial and strategic vision, and to co-operative interaction and network building practices. It contributes to the field of research on cultural management through its study of the effects of management systems on the strategic action of independent visual arts organizations. © 2011 Taylor & Francis.","Artist-run centres; Management of non-profit organizations; Montreal; Quebec; Visual arts",,,,,,,"Independent arts centres are one of the peculiar characteristics of the Canadian visual art environment. This organizational typology has been successfully established in Canada following the example of other art scenes such as New York and other American cities. For a groundbreaking analysis of the onset of independent art spaces during the 1960s and 1970s, see Batia (1979). Early examples of Canadian independent art spaces are found in Toronto and Montreal at the end of the 1960s, when they were set up by particular categories of artists in the wake of politically, culturally and gender-motivated movements. During the 1970s, such spaces were free and independent galleries managed by collectives, often of female artists (e.g., La Centrale, which is still operating in Montreal), aiming on the one hand to foster experimental research and on the other to host exhibitions of invited artists. While being private, from the beginning these spaces were financially supported not only through funds provided by the artists’ collective, but also through public grants.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Batia, S., Artist-run galleries: A contemporary institutional change in the visual arts (1979) Qualitative Sociology, 2, pp. 3-28; Bellavance, G., Bernier, L., Laplante, B., (2005) Le Conditions Pratique Des Artistes En Art Visuels, , Montreal: Institut National de la Recherche Scientifique, INRS Urbanisation, Culture et Société; Bennet, T., (1995) The Birth of the Museum: History, Theory, Politics, , London: Routledge; Boime, A., Entrepreneurial patronage in nineteenth-century France (1976) Enterprise and Entrepreneurs In Nineteenth- and Twentieth-century France, pp. 137-207. , In E.C.

It provides a flexible framework for arts organizations to evaluate the impact of funding decisions. Developing tools that allow organizations to demonstrate their impact provides robust information to further build the evidence base for the cultural sector. The second edition (2009) has been revised after evaluation and consultation with arts organizations and Scottish Arts Council staff. Taking this approach and gathering further evidence is an important step in the lead up to Creative Scotland (which is the newly established creative arts funding body within Scotland). Continuous improvement tools not only gather evidence but can improve work practices. The Quality Framework should be viewed in the context of the National Performance Framework, as gathering outcome evidence will also assist in the production of Local Authority Single Outcome Agreements. This review also looks at the Unified Quality Improvement Framework, an over-arching tool that will assist local authorities and other service providers to evaluate the quality of their culture and sport provision.

After more than 50 years of policies and programmes to support funding diversification in the UK cultural sector, research suggests the sector remains dependent on public funding and relatively reluctant to explore new ways of exploiting their assets. Policies directed at addressing these issues concentrate on correcting perceived disparities in terms of cultural form and location (i.e., the London Effect). Empirical research suggests, however, that successful private fundraising is not significantly associated with the region where the organization operates. Instead, successful funding diversification may be closely related to factors such as organizational infrastructure and attitudes towards innovation and risk. This article expands on initial descriptive analysis undertaken from responses to a questionnaire on financial sustainability at museums, libraries and archives in England commissioned by the Museums, Libraries and Archives Council in 2008. Guided by a conceptual framework, the article focuses on developing typologies of characteristics related to an organization's infrastructure, attitudes and beliefs, and their level of funding diversification. This line of research has implications for policy, training and organizational development of cultural enterprises. The ongoing fiscal retrenchment and growing outcomes agenda have provided the setting for more entrepreneurial activities in the sector, without major changes to its organizational infrastructure. The article aims to provide insights into the sustainability of these activities as both economic activity and fiscal constraints increase. © 2011 Taylor & Francis.","Archives; Arts management; Cultural policy; Funding diversification; Libraries; Museums",,,,,,,"Public (grant) funding Gift economy","Variation amongst clusters for grant funding.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Andreoni, J., Payne, A., Government grants to private charities: Do they crowd out giving or fundraising?

For example, within the 2020 Summit, at least 19 recommendations by the committee on ""Towards a creative Australia"" related to proposed tax changes (Australia, 2008). However, there are already a number of tax provisions that assist the art sector (either directly or indirectly) - is it that the current concessions are ineffective, not well understood or something else? This article reports on the survey results of 236 people involved in the arts sector (either as artists, arts organizations, advisors or supporters). This article reports the findings of the survey in terms of bettering understanding how taxpayers, particularly those involved in the arts sector, accessed tax information, their tax awareness of current tax provisions that directly/indirectly affect the arts. Furthermore, it explores what those involved in the sector consider to be their greatest tax issues. Given the survey results, it will be argued that to ensure that any reforms for this sector to be effective there needs to be greater considerations to the way that artists access tax information, and their level of competency in dealing with tax obligations, and how practical strategies can be implemented within the current framework to assist the arts. It will be argued that this background understanding is critical in determining what tax reforms, if any, are needed to ensure that reforms are not done just for change's sake. © 2011 Taylor & Francis.","Artist/art policy; Attitude; Awareness; Cultural policy; Reform; Tax",,,,,,,"13 Australia Cultural Fund administered by Australian Business Art Foundation (AbaF)","Voluntary withholding agreements – PAYG Self-employed persons contribution to superannuation Guarantee superannuation for employees Australia Cultural Fund administered by Australian Business Art Foundation (AbaF) Deductions for charity dinners/ auctions Deductions for the donation of cultural goods Workplace Giving Program",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Adair, A., (1999) Performing Public Funding of the Performing Arts, pp. 20-24. , Policy, Winter; The impact of the non-commercial loss provisions of the ITAA on professional artists (2004), Arts Law Centre, Submission to the Board of Taxation.

Workers typically experience multiple entry attempts, spells of unemployment, short-term contracts, high degrees of mobility, casual/ part-time employment within and outside the creative industries, and pressure to ensure their skills remain relevant. Skills shortages and gaps, an insufficient supply of high quality industry-ready graduates, difficulties in predicting demand for skills, weak linkages between industry and education providers, reliance on overseas talent in some segments, limited opportunities for workers to engage in skill development and pressure on workers to keep abreast of technological developments are ongoing issues in the creative industries workforce. In response to these concerns, the Australian Research Council, three State Governments, industry and a large vocational education and training (VET) provider funded Queensland University of Technology (QUT) to conduct the 60Sox project. This 3-year project investigated the education, training and work experiences of aspiring creatives defined as new entrants, recent graduates and students enrolled in creative industries courses. It involved the largest survey of aspiring creatives ever undertaken in Australia, attracting 507 respondents, and a survey of 50 employers. Using the framework proposed by Hannan, Raffe and Smyth (1996), this article presents findings from an analysis of the macro and micro labour market outcomes of aspiring creatives using data from the two 60Sox project surveys and publicly available sources. The analysis confirmed that many graduates of creative industries courses who participated in the 60Sox survey and the national surveys for the National Centre for Vocational Education Research and Graduate Careers Australia were struggling to make a successful transition from education to work. This article also discusses the causes of this key finding and possible solutions to address transition issues. © 2011 Taylor & Francis.","Aspiring creatives; Australia; Creative industries; Education-to-work transitions; Graduates; Pathways; Skills",,,,,,"Centre of Excellence for Electromaterials Science, Australian Research Council

This is one approach which addresses the imprecision of official statistics in grasping the emergent nature of the creative industries. The article discusses the policy implications of the differences between emphasizing industry and occupation or workforce. It provides qualitative case studies that provide further perspectives on quantitative analysis of the creative workforce. It also outlines debates about the implications for the cultural disciplines of an evidence-based account of creative labour. The ""creative trident"" methodology is summarized: it is the total of creative occupations within the core creative industries (specialists), plus the creative occupations employed in other industries (embedded) plus the business and support occupations employed in creative industries who are often responsible for managing, accounting for and technically supporting creative activity (support). The method is applied to the arts workforce in Australia. An industryfacing spin-off from the centre's mapping work, Creative Business Benchmarker, is discussed. The implications of this approach to the creative workforce is raised and exemplified in case studies of design and of the health industry. © 2011 Taylor & Francis.","Arc centre of excellence for creative industries and innovation; Creative industries; Creative labour; Creative trident; Creative workforce; Precarious labour",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Andrews, G., Yeabsley, J., Higgs, P., (2009) The Creative Sector in New Zealand - Mapping and Economic Role, , http://eprints.qut.edu.au/31133/, Wellington: New Zealand Trade & Enterprise.

Although it is widely known that artists hold multiple jobs for a variety of reasons, there is little information on which jobs artists take on, whether they can make use of their creative skills in these jobs and how far artists doing non-arts work are different from artists who don't. We focus on two aspects of artists' non-arts work. First, we consider artists' working patterns in non-arts areas in general, looking particularly at the factors that influence artists to take on work outside the arts. Second, we analyse the extent to which artists are able to apply their creative skills in industries beyond the core arts, interpreting these results in the context of the concentric circles model of the cultural industries.

It is noted that the design of arts funding systems is a neglected topic in Cultural Economics, despite the relatively large sums involved and the unevenness of their disbursement. In New Zealand, on average, more than 40 cents of public money is handed over to arts producers for every dollar that the sector earns in the private market (the ""box-office""), but with huge variations for different art categories. Nearly all support is directed at the supply side of the arts, whereas the principles of public finance suggest that funding should be ex post, topping-up revenues earned from the sale of art in the market. The article develops the mechanics of a performance-based arts funding system. © 2011 Taylor & Francis.","Externalities; New zealand; Performance-based arts funding",,,,,,"Creative New Zealand

Creative New Zealand","Now, in New Zealand, as elsewhere, government funding of professional art has two striking features: it is largely focused on the supply side of the art system, and it is notably skewed in its distribution. To elaborate: virtually all New Zealand government arts funding is directed either at developing the capability to produce art (“towards a three-week creative development workshop: $28,750”),1 at the support of specific projects (“towards writing a history of the State Literary Fund: $30,400”) or simply to assist the survival of the arts organization (“Auckland University Press: towards a block publishing grant for 2008: $19,500”). As for the distribution of funds, Creative New Zealand (being the central government’s principal art funding delivery agency) disbursed $8.7 million in “contestable” grants over the 2007/08 year, awarded to 465 successful applicants from the 1400 applying – a success rate of one-third and an average grant of $18,700. Creative New Zealand in the same year handed over $15.3 million to 36 “recurrently funded organizations” (RFOs) – that is, $424,000 on average, with a success rate, in effect, close to 1.0, once RFO status has been granted. The RFO total is more than doubled by adding in the separately funded “glamorous megafauna” of the arts jungle: the national symphony orchestra, the national ballet and the film production industry.","Table 1 assembles the information. Each column reports total annual (circa 200816) funding, from the sources listed on the rows – recurrent (block grant) funding from Creative New Zealand, contestable (usually project) funding from Creative New Zealand, and the other sources which we will go through by sector. Note that local government funding, which is quite important for performance art (theatre, opera, orchestras) is not included here. The last rows add up the total funding and show my estimates of New Zealand sales at retail (i.e., revenues earned from the consumers of the art – box-office, book sales, record sales etc.). The bottom line is the ratio of public funding to retail earnings. This makes interesting – perhaps shocking – reading. The least supported art sector is literature,17 which even with the Authors’ Fund (New Zealand’s public lending right programme18) is almost self-supporting in the market. Books are also the biggest single art sector, accounting for around 45% of all retail art sales in New Zealand, by my estimates.19","The author thanks the editors, two referees and, in particular, Bruce Seaman for expert and helpful comments on the first draft.

This often extends to measuring an organization's artistic excellence, or, in Australian terms, ""artistic vibrancy"". In some countries, such as England and Australia, funding bodies require major arts organizations to ""self-assess"" their own artistic excellence and vibrancy. But can such a thing really be measured? In 2009, the Australia Council for the Arts conducted research into the concept of measuring artistic vibrancy. As there had been little formal research in the area, the Australia Council conducted primary research into what might represent ""good practice"" in artistic self-assessment amongst major performing arts organizations in Australia and the United Kingdom, in the art forms of opera, orchestral and chamber music, dance and theatre (including circus). The researchers' key finding was that there is no ""one size fits all"" approach to assessing artistic vibrancy. Arts organizations will adopt a variety of methods that suit their unique environments, both across art forms and within them. However, in general, it was found that good practice in artistic self-assessment almost always involved: a frank culture of feedback, within the organization, and with audiences and external stake holders; a meaningful engagement with assessment as part of a performance improvement process, and a related aversion to ""box ticking""; a genuine commitment to peer review; and acting on the outcomes of artistic selfassessment to improve future work. This article will examine the Australian policy context of the research, review the literature in relation to measuring ""artistic vibrancy"", and present key, good practice case studies of ""artistic self-assessment"", including the Royal Opera House and Scottish Opera, United Kingdom, and Circus Oz, Australia. The article will conclude with an analysis of the findings from the case studies, and suggestions for further research and policy directions for other funding bodies grappling with the issue of how to measure artistic vibrancy. © 2010 Taylor & Francis.","Artistic assessment; Australia; Britain; Performing arts",,,,,,,"The Scottish government employs independent, expert assessors to review the artistic standards of Scottish “national performing companies”.2 The Scottish Arts Council also has a “Quality Framework” for its funded arts organizations which they can use in their self-assessment and to develop their applications for funding.

As the debates have gained momentum over the last decade, considerable discourse has been devoted to who should be involved in decisions about what values we should be measuring to substantiate funding from the public purse. The concept of Public Value has been of interest to these discussions because it reminds us that public funding should be spent effectively to provide benefits for citizens and that it is the duty of governments and their funded agencies collectively to achieve this end. Though Public Value emphasizes the relationship between government decision makers and the managers of public sector institutions, the role of citizens in the process of identifying and defining Public Value is both unclear and contested. This article examines what, if any, role the public play in defining Public Value within Australia's publicly funded arts and cultural heritage sector. Although evidence of increasing consultation and engagement between industry stake holders and what Moore (1995) calls ""the authorizing environment"" and examples of engaging the general public in identifying Public Value exist, it finds that the public view of value is not formally embedded into decision-making processes at the government policy and planning levels. © 2010 Taylor & Francis.","Consultation; Measurement; Policy; Public Value; Value",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Aabo, S., Are public libraries worth their price?

We discuss the adoption of Geographic Information Technologies in our own cultural research projects, motivated by empirical shortcomings with existing creative industries and cultural planning research methods, coupled with a desire to more fully explore the geography of cultural life within Australian cities. Geographic Information Technologies can comprise a range of technologies (proprietary GIS software systems, GPS, web mapping) that seek to accumulate geographical information for analysis within computer database systems. In our projects, Geographic Information Technologies enabled spatially sensitive questions about creative activity, affective links to city environments and cultural vitality (asked in interviews and focus groups) to be linked to central map databases. ""Collisions of epistemologies"" (Brown & Knopp, 2008) were made possible, dissolving boundaries between qualitative and quantitative methods, and connecting our philosophical commitment to everyday, vernacular forms of culture to matters of cultural planning. Results showed a refreshing amount of creative activity occurring beyond visible ""hubs"", in suburbs and the vernacular spaces of everyday life. Moreover, cultural life - and creative activities more specifically - was layered, localized and multifaceted within cities, in ways that preclude singular generalizations. Geographic Information Technologies and maps - with their capacities to capture complexity and layered phenomena - helped communicate such findings in digestible formats, to a range of community and government audiences. © 2010 Taylor & Francis.","Creative city; Cultural mapping; Cultural planning; Geographic Information Systems (GIS); Geographic Information Technologies; Geoweb; Global Positioning System (GPS)",,,,,,"Australian Research Council, ARC","Our second project, Cultural Asset Mapping for Regional Australia (CAMRA; http://culturemap. org.au/), built on experiences in the Darwin creative city mapping project, in the broader context of cultural planning for regional and remote parts of Australia.

However, very little research has been conducted in the more established cultural planning contexts of Australia, Great Britain and the United States let alone in Canada to support the assertions that underlie much of the movement's continued success. In particular, there has been an absence of research on the actual outcomes of the cultural planning strategy.This article examines whether the wide range of strategic goals presented in most cultural plans are being met. The method for assessing the effectiveness of cultural plans involved analyzing which strategic objectives were implemented as recorded in progress reports and as reported on by cultural planners. The research findings show that cultural plans are being effectively implemented and the majority of strategic goals contained within most cultural plans are being achieved. In addition, it is observed that the strategic objectives being implemented are not limited to traditional arts sector concerns. © 2010 Taylor & Francis.","Arts; Canada; Cultural planning; Mid-size cities; Ontario; Policy outcomes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Baeker, G., (1999) Museums and Community Cultural Planning: A Case Study in Participatory Action Research in Peterborough Ontario, , (Unpublished doctoral dissertation).

It sets the museum sector workforce in the context of the population as a whole and makes some comparisons to the diversity of the wider cultural sector workforce. It looks also at positive action training schemes, targeted at underrepresented minority groups, in particular the Museums Association's Diversify scheme, looking at their cost and effectiveness in securing employment. It also describes other positive action schemes such as Arts Council England's Inspire programme and Diversify management-level traineeships and traineeships for deaf and disabled people. It tentatively considers the impact and value for money of positive-action training. It also sets out the legal and policy context for workforce diversification, in particular the implications for data collection of section 37 of the Race Relations Act 1976. The headline finding is that the proportion of people from minority-ethnic backgrounds in the UK museum sector increased from 2.5% in 1993 to about 7% in 2006-2008. This varies between 1.3% and 10.4% depending on the type of museum and the type of job and compares to an overall minority-ethnic working age population of 12.6% in England in 2008. There is a significant under-representation of most (but probably not all) minority-ethnic groups in most areas of museum work. The paper concludes by making brief suggestions about how policy makers and researchers might respond. © 2010 Taylor & Francis.","Cultural diversity; Diversify; Ethnic profile; Inspire; Minority; Museum; Positive action; Race Relations Act; Workforce",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Ethnic minority access to museum careers (1998) Museums Journal, 98 (10), p. 40. , Anonymous, October; Promoting diversity (1999) Museums Journal, 99 (7), p. 53. , Anonymous, July; Positive action training (2001) Museum Practice, 6 (2), p. 71. , Anonymous; (2009) Inspire Fellowship Programme, , http://www.artscouncil.org.uk/artforms/visual-arts/inspire-fellowship-programme, Arts Council England, Retrieved March 2009, from; (1999) Positive Action Training Scheme, , Bristol, December, Report to Bristol City Council Corporate Services Committee; (2008) Black, Asian and Minority-ethnic Leadership in the Creative and Cultural Sector, , Change Institute, London: The Cultural Leadership Programme; (2009) CILIP Launches Encompass Toolkit: Promoting a Diverse Library and Information Workforce, , http://www.cilip.org.uk/jobs-careers/qualifications/encompass/pages/gazettearticle2.aspx, The Chartered Institute of Library & Information Professionals (CILIP), Retrieved March 24, 2009, from, and http://www.cilip.org.uk/jobs-careers/qualifications/encompass/pages/default.aspx; (2008) The Creative and Cultural Industries: Impact and Footprint 2008/09, , Creative and Cultural Skills (CCS), London: Author; (2009) Diversity Figures in Cultural Heritage, , Creative and Cultural Skills, CCS Internal Excel spreadsheet; (2009) Diversity in Cultural Heritage and The Arts, , Creative and Cultural Skills, London: Author; (1999) Labour Market Information Survey, , Cultural Heritage National Training Organisation (CHNTO), London: CCS; Davies, M., The tomorrow people: Entry to the museum workforce (2007) Report to The Museums Association and University of East Anglia, , London: Museums Association; (1990) Museums Journal, 90 (11), p. 7. , Editorial, November; (1992) Museums Journal, 92 (8), p. 7. , Editorial, August; (2009) Ethnic Monitoring Frequently Asked Questions, , http://www.equalityhumanrights.com/en/aboutus/Pages/FAQs2.aspx#400, Equalities and Human Rights Commission (EHRC), Retrieved from; Galloway, S., Lindley, R., Behle, H., (2005) Working in the Presentation of the Contemporary Visual Arts, , Warwick: Warwick Institute for Employment Research; Greene, J.P., Museums for the year 2000: A case for continuous revolution (1989) Museums Journal, 88 (4), pp. 179-180; (2007) What Do Master's Graduates Do?, , http://www.hecsu.ac.uk/assets/assets/documents/What_Do_Masters_Graduates_Do_2007.pdf, Higher Education Careers Services Unit (HECSU), Retrieved from; (2007) Creative Industries Assoc.

Canada has a network of publicly funded institutions in support of contemporary art. Public funding for the arts is direct and plural: it operates at three levels of government - federal, provincial and municipal - and is distributed by government departments and arts councils. Canadian institutions in receipt of public funding relevant to contemporary art include art schools, artist-run centres, non-collecting exhibition venues and art museums. A perception that this creates and maintains a circular system for contemporary art that is co-ordinated via state funding is reconsidered. In addition, it is misleading to consider a boundary divide, with state and not-for-profit sector organizations separated from private and commercial ones. The role of art market intermediaries, namely contemporary art dealers (or gallerists), who are responsible for representing artists and promoting their work for the first time (on the primary art market) to collectors, is integral. It also represents one measure of the overall health of Canada's contemporary art market system. Attention is drawn to the situation where few contemporary art dealers based in Canada have the economic resources to compete in the international arena, with one consequence being the adoption of non- Canadian dealers to represent leading contemporary artists from Canada. The emergence of a generation of aboriginal artists living and working in Canada is another development, one that speaks to the hybrid representations of Canadian identity. © 2010 Taylor & Francis.","Art market; Canada; Contemporary art; Cultural policy; Public funding",,,,,,"British Columbia Arts Council, BCAC

Its two operating principles, independent from government and peer assessment, have been adopted at the provincial and municipal levels. Most recently, the Canada Council has started to house and pilot the collection of financial information through a new national online database, Canadian Arts Data/Données sur les arts au Canada (CADAC). CADAC enables member arts organizations applying for operating funding from public funders – thus far the Alberta Foundation for the Arts, the British Columbia Arts Council, the City of Vancouver, the New Brunswick Department of Wellness, Culture and Sport, the Manitoba Arts Council, the Ontario Arts Council, the Saskatchewan Arts Board and the Toronto Arts Council – to submit their financial information in the same format.","in 2007/08; the Conseil des arts and des letters du Quebec had a budget of $90 million for 2007/ 08; and the Ontario Arts Council budget is $60 million. Quebec’s bounty relative to the Canada Council and Ontario is one indication of the how arts funding, following a French model of state support, has been used to promote Quebec’s identity. Public funding for the arts also takes place at the municipal level: the Toronto Arts Council, which is funded by the Arts Services Section of the Cultural Division of the City of Toronto, has approximately $10 million to distribute; the Conseil des arts de Montreal has a grants budget in excess of $10 million; and the City of Vancouver’s Cultural Services (within Community Services) provides grants in excess of $10 million.","Public funding is important for Canada’s most significant art museums, yet the level of direct public subsidy varies. Federal museums like the NGC can be separated from provincial counterparts such as the MMFA and the AGO. The NGC received $52 million from the federal government in 2007/08, which accounted for 81% of its operating revenue. The MMFA’s 2007/08 operating revenue of $26 million is based on 61% direct public subsidy, with the Quebec Ministère de la Culture, des Communications et de la Condition féminine providing virtually all of it. The AGO relies on a direct public subsidy, primarily from the Ontario Ministry of Culture; this amounted to approximately $12.5 million, in both 2006/07 and 2007/08, namely 40–45% of the AGO’s operating revenue. (The re-opened AGO received an operating grant from the Ontario Ministry of Culture of $21.5 million.) The VAG received 26% of its operating revenue, of $22 million in 2007/08, from grants: approximately 60% of its grant income was from the City of Vancouver, with the British Columbia Arts Council and Canada Council each contributing about 15%.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Becker, H., (1982) Art Worlds, , Berkeley, CA: University of California Press; Bronson, A.A., Blouin, R., Gale, P., Lewis, G., (1987) From Sea to Shining Sea: Artist-initiated Activity in Canada, 1937-1987, , (Eds.), Toronto: Power Plant; Buck, L., (2004) Market Matters: The Dynamics of the Contemporary Art World, , London: Arts Council of England; Canadian Heritage, , http://www.pch.gc.ca/pc-ch/os-ac/cac-cca-eng.cfm, Canada Council for the Arts.

It considers how the autonomy of the Scottish Arts Council (SAC) was tested in conflicts involving both ACGB and government for control of Scottish arts policy from the 1940s onwards. Our argument is that, from the establishment of ACGB's Scottish Committee - SAC's forerunner - in 1947 until devolution in 1999, Scotland enjoyed considerable autonomy over arts policy, because it was at ""double arm's length"" from government. This made it less directly accountable, but it also allowed Scotland the freedom to develop the arts in different ways to the rest of Britain. Devolution ended this ""double arm's length"" relationship and the article argues that the politicization of the arts combined with the drive for public sector efficiency since then, has taken Scotland along a path of convergence with England, both in models of governance and policy. © 2010 Taylor & Francis.","Arm's length; Autonomy; Creative scotland; Devolution; National identity; Scottish arts council",,,,,,"Arts and Humanities Research Council, AHRC","The authors would like to acknowledge the support of the Arts and Humanities Research Council (Grant No. F009887/1) and thank three anonymous reviewers for their helpful comments.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"(1956) The First Ten Years: The 11th Annual Report of the Arts Council of Great Britain, , Arts Council of Great Britain, London: Author; (1987) The arts, politics, Power and the Purse: An International Conference on the Structure of Arts Funding: A Report, , Arts Council of Great Britain, London: Author; Beck, A., The impact of Thatcherism on the Arts Council (1989) Parliamentary Affairs, 42 (3), pp. 362-367; Bell, D., The 2010-11 Draft Budget (2009) Report By David Bell, , http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/s3/committees/finance/budget/documents/2010-11adviserpaper.pdf, (Ed.), University of Stirling to the Finance Committee, Scottish Parliament, September 2009.

Thirty years since the 1978 Constitution, Spain is a quasi-federal state. Their cultural life and policies have expanded and have been decentralized. The redistribution process is a result of the search of effectiveness confronted with the question of the legitimization of power. Legitimacy is a permanent theme of debate as well as a discursive and strategic instrument between institutional actors, and it sheds light on the apparent inconsistencies of the multi-level governance of cultural policies. To study the different aspects of these relationships, the article principally focuses on three areas. The first is an institutional analysis, which allows us to determine the place of each institutional actor within the network of cultural policies as well as the horizontal and vertical interactions. The second is an analysis of the public financing of culture, which permits us to measure the quantitative impact of cultural policies within the centre-periphery dynamic. The third is an analysis of public policies, which allows a comparative approach to the dynamics of the autonomous community regime. The dialectic between differentiation and standardization, a mark of cultural policies modernity in the context of centre-periphery relationships, is a result of the pressure from the main players on the different Spanish cultural and territorial markets. Examples of ""good practices"" mimicry as well as of ""new"" pattern models, like the new Arts Council of Catalonia, are used to expose the non-existence of a formal Spanish model of cultural policy, but shows the process of innovation-reply product strategies, and the dialectic between political autonomy and homogenization processes. © 2010 Taylor & Francis.","Cultural policies; Efficiency; Legitimacy; Multi-level governance; Public financing of culture; Spain",,,,,,,"By the end of the decade, the relations between the Ministry of Culture and the autonomous communities entered into a more stable phase.

Apart from its daily news, the weekly news programme Los reporteros (The Reporters), launched in 1990 by Canal Sur Televisión, is its longest lasting programme to date. The aim of this article is to consider the contribution of Andalusian Regional State-run Television, and more specifically of Los reporteros, to the dissemination of cusltural issues and the cultural policy of the Andalusian Regional Government (Junta de Andalucía). The most viewed programmes on RTVA are the news, magazines, and entertainment (music and humour) shows, especially musicals focusing on copla and flamenco, and the broadcasting of popular cultural traditions (Holy Week, El Rocío Pilgrimage, Ferias, bullfighting etc.). The quantitative analysis of Los reporteros' reports about cultural affairs broadcast between 1990 and 2008 (c. 210 reports) reveals a particular image of Andalusian culture. Although its audience figures do not now reach the numbers of other, more successful entertainment shows, Los reporteros has probably provided the most relevant news offer about ""culture"" and has contributed to improving the brand image of the channel, through its social, cultural and international journalistic concerns. evertheless, there is potential for the spread of culture to figure more prominently in RTVA's informative programmes, both daily and weekly alike. © 2010 Taylor & Francis.","Andalusia; Cultural policy; Culture; Journalism; Spain; State service broadcasting; Television",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Bustamante, E., (2006) Radio Y Televisión En España: Historia De Una Asignatura Pendiente De La Democracia [Radio and Television in Spain: An Unresolved Matter of Democracy], , Barcelona: Gedisa; Díaz, N.B., Los Medios Y La Modernización De Andalucía (2002) Informe De La Comunicación 2002, , Madrid: Ediciones Tiempo; (1982) Boletín Oficial Del Estado (BOE), p. 9. , Estatuto de Autonomía para Andalucía [Andalusian Statute of Autonomy], January 11; (2007) Boletín Oficial Del Estado (BOE), p. 68. , Estatuto de Autonomía para Andalucía (Reforma) [Reform of Andalusian Statute of Autonomy], March 20; (2003) Documento De Estrategias Y Propuestas Para La Segunda Modernización De Andalucía [Strategies and Proposals.

Through an examination of the impact that federal and provincial film and television tax credit programmes have on labour markets and workers in the English language Canadian independent film and television production industry, this analysis will demonstrate that despite having an overall, albeit fluctuating, positive impact on the volume of work at national and subnational levels, tax credit programmes at the provincial level are producing perverse labour market effects. Although designed to promote Canada and its provincial jurisdictions as globally competitive centres of excellence for film and television production, the application of the tax credit scheme has negatively impacted on both working conditions and labour mobility for highly skilled film and television production workers in the English language independent production sector. The end result is a policy regime deeply rooted in a competition framework that contributes to, rather than ameliorates, the vulnerability of workers in film and television production labour markets in both major and regional production centres. © 2010 Taylor & Francis.","Cultural labour; Cultural policy; Film and television production; Tax credits",,,,,,,"6.

This has had particular consequences for our understanding of the impact of cultural policy in the peripheral north of England. Despite the political realities of geographical peripherality that still persist today, there are very few examples of research designed to address the ways in which cultural policy has been operationalized in the context of peripheral political cultures. This article presents findings from comparative research on cultural policy in Liverpool and NewcastleGateshead, with specific focus on the role of local government in cultural policy making, to show the importance of local political culture in shaping cultural policy. The intention therefore is to demystify the role of cultural policy beyond its value as a rhetorical policy device in a global economy to understand how such policy is used in practice to validate notions of the political particular. The aim is therefore to bridge the empirical gap between global and local assumptions about the role of cultural policy, whilst exploring the institutions underpinning local leadership and collaboration in arts and cultural policy. © 2010 Taylor & Francis.","Cultural policy; European capital of culture; Liverpool; Local policy making; Newcastlegateshead; Political culture",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Arnold, M., (1901) Culture and Anarchy, , New Haven, CT: Yale University Press; Bailey, C., (2006) Cultural Values and Culture Led Regeneration - the Case of Newcastle-Gateshead, , http://www.fokus.or.at/fileadmin/fokus/user/downloads/acei_paper/Bailey.doc, Retrieved May 10, 2009, from; Bailey, C., Miles, S., Stark, P., Culture led urban regeneration and the revitalisation of identities in Newcastle, Gateshead and the North East of England (2004) International Journal of Cultural Policy, 10 (1), pp. 47-65; Belchem, J.C., (2000) Merseypride: Essays in Liverpool Exceptionalism, , Liverpool: Liverpool University Press; Belchem, J.C., (2006) Liverpool 800 Culture, Character, History, , Ed, Liverpool: Liverpool University Press; Bianchini, F., (1989) Urban Renaissance? the Arts and The Urban Regeneration Process, , in 1980s Britain (Centre for Urban Studies Working Paper No. 7).

However, there are still only a handful of studies investigating different aspects of the cultural industries in Poland. The research reported in this article aims to investigate Polish musicians' perceptions of their current situation in the music industry, and their opinions on the changing nature of the production and consumption of music in Poland. A series of interviews were done with a cross-section of different generations of musicians. Their analysis shows a number of key themes emerging, which are discussed in the article. They broadly cover four major issues: the current situation of musicians, the music business, education and society.

The greater challenge has been to evaluate the outcomes from the Fund's generic programmes, which can fund any type of heritage and which between them account for over two-thirds of total funding.

Such terms have been adopted as part of a reductionist construct that seeks to tease out and classify the differing impacts of cultural experiences. The adoption of such a classification risks signalling that on the one hand, culture cannot make a major contribution to mainstream agendas such as health and education, whereas on the other hand, it almost suggests that if cultural experiences do contribute to personal, community or societal development, then this is incidental and therefore not the true role of culture and cultural activity. The author argues that the adoption of the term “instrumental”, and its application in this context, is not only meaningless, but also unhelpful and potentially damaging to the cause of the cultural sector. © 2008, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","instrumental; instrumentalism; intrinsic; museums; public value; social impact",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"(2005) Social impact programme assessment, , Unpublished paper, Tyne & Wear Museums and Bristols Museums, Galleries and Archives; Austin, M., Culture and identity: Three Antipodean museums Paper presented at CongressCATH, , Bradford, UK; (2005) New directions in social policy: Developing the evidence base for museums, libraries and archives in England, , London: Museums, Libraries and Archives Council; (2006) MLA: Social outcomes for museums, libraries and archives–Prototype social outcomes framework, , Unpublished paper; (2000) Centres for social change: Museums, galleries and archives for all, , London: Author; (2005) Understanding the future: Museums and 21st century life, , London: Author; Dewey, J., (1922) Human nature and conduct, , New York: Henry Holt & Company; Dewey, J., (1934) Art as experience, , New York: Minton, Balch & Company; (2000) Museums and social inclusion: The GLLAM report, , Leicester, UK: University of Leicester; Holden, J., (2004) Capturing cultural value, , London: Demos; Holden, J., (2006) Cultural value and the crisis of legitimacy, , London: Demos; Jowell, T., (2004) Government and the value of culture, , London: Department for Culture, Media and Sport; MacKenzie, J.M., (2001) The Victorian vision: Inventing new Britain, , MacKenzie J.M., (ed), London: V&A, Edited by; Matarasso, F., (1997) Use or ornament?

This article will challenge the historical accuracy of claims that “instrumentality” is a recent “threat” to the management and funding of culture. Rather I will argue that historically, instrumental cultural policies have been policies of production. Further, through an analysis of the terms of the “instrumentalization debate” in relation to museums I will show that there is no consensus in the understanding of what constitutes instrumental or intrinsic functions. The “instrumental/intrinsic” dichotomy is too simplistic to allow grounded critical engagement with the real complexities of cultural institutions and programmes. Finally, I argue that in order to work critically with institutions, policies and programmes it is necessary to engage with the practicalities of their arrangements. To do so is to recognize the complexity of institutions which are often internally divided. While commentators simply continue to de-construct the “instrumentalist” cultural policy agenda, the reality is that some cultural institutions continue to pay, at best, lip service to the political imperative to become more inclusive. In this social and political context, critical engagement, which is grounded in the practicalities of culture's administration, is crucial if we are to develop analyses that seek to understand and contribute to the development of programmes that break with the elitisms which have characterized cultural programmes in the past. © 2008, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","critique; cultural policy; instrumentality; museums; value",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Adorno, T., Culture and administration (1991) The culture industry: Selected essays on mass culture, pp. 107-131. , Bernstein J.M., (ed), London: Routledge,.

Capturing Cultural Value maintains that museums can overcome the dichotomy between intrinsic and instrumentalist value by focusing on public value and learning from other disciplines to articulate a more rounded view of their role. Valuing Museums protests the range of non-traditional roles imposed on museums by government. The McMaster Review argues that external measurement should be replaced by professional judgement. For all three, history begins in 1979 so that the account of the “traditional” lacks depth. The missing history is summarized, recalling the reformist origins of many museums and their later retreat from social engagement. This reflects the development of what Perkin calls the “professional society”, in which technical experts dominated virtually unchallenged in the century before the advent of Thatcherism–in 1979. The lack of a unitary traditional museum role is revealed through a case study–the Jameel Gallery of Islamic Art in the V&A. This reveals internal disagreement about the relative authority of visitor and the curators. The failure to act on the extensive visitor studies carried out during the gallery development leads to a significant reduction in the value produced for the public–there is no attempt to represent how the objects were seen from within the cultures which created them, thus excluding a wide range of human meanings. For museums to realize their potential role in society they need to embrace the dual task of revealing the meanings of the objects in their care, and of doing do so in ways that contribute to the continuing process of democratization. The alternative is that they continue to support increasing inequality. © 2008, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","democracy; excellence; museums; professions; visitor studies",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Aldridge, S., (2004) Life chances and social mobility: An overview of the evidence, , http://www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/strategy/work_areas/˜/media/assets/www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/strategy/lifechances_socialmobility%20pdf.ashx, Retrieved June 7, 2008, from; Beard, M., Henderson, J., (2000) Classics: A very short introduction, , Oxford, UK: Oxford University Press; Belfiore, E., Art as a means towards alleviating social exclusion: Does it really work?

Although many of its intentions are laudable, the report fails to resolve the inherent problems associated with defining, measuring and judging cultural “excellence”, even though this forms the core of McMaster's argument about how policy should develop. This may have significant implications for cultural institutions in the future. In addition, many of the report's recommendations may either be contradictory or impractical in the current policy climate–such as the desire for institutions to take more risks whilst simultaneously increasing visitor numbers and meeting other targets. As such, without a wider change in the Government's approach and a re-acknowledgement of culture's intrinsic value, “excellence” may just become the latest buzzword for practitioners, rather than the key principle upon which future decisions will be based. © 2008, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","arts; excellence; McMaster Review; policy review",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Akbar, A., Arts funding: Creative community hails increase as ‘good result’ (2007) The Independent, , http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/arts-funding-creative-community-hails-increase-as-good-result-396476.html, October 10, Retrieved March 20, 2008, from; (2007) The children's plan.

The changes in cultural policy are analysed using the definitions of intrinsic and instrumental policy. Analysis is presented from the perspective of a cultural agency working with both central government in Scotland and cultural service providers. Over the period of devolution there has been some policy shifts most notably the recent change from the Labour administration's approach of developing cultural entitlements, to the new administration's development of a National Performance Framework for all parts of government and all public bodies. This new “Framework” has a focus on outcomes and targets and the new government is seeking alignment from all to progress its core purpose of achieving “sustainable economic growth”. This policy change appears to denote a shift from attempting to take account of the intrinsic value of culture in cultural policy to an instrumental approach. What is not clear is if the outcome based approach of the National Performance Framework which appears instrumental in its design will in its implementation allow for the intrinsic value of culture to be implicit. © 2008, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","culture; instrumental; intrinsic; museum; policy; Scotland",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Cousins, L., (2008) The potential of sport: Maximising sport's contribution to national and local outcomes., , http://www.sportscotland.org.uk/ChannelNavigation/Resource+Library/Publications/The+Potential+of+Sport.htm, Retrieved July 28, 2008, from; (2007) New performance framework for local authorities and local authority partnerships: Single Set of national indicators, , http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/localgovernment/nationalindicator, Retrieved October 24, 2008, from; Fabiani, L., (2007) Creative Scotland Bill and cultural policy, , http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/officialReports/meetingsParliament/or-07/sor1107-02.htm, Scottish Parliament, Official Report 7 November 2007, Col3072-3088.

Museums are therefore currently unsustainable institutions, which pass on their expanded collections in a way that increases the management burden for future generations. In order to address this problem, it is argued that disposal must have a significant role to play in collections management. It is still rarely used because a professional reticence over the issue has developed, both through decades of training which has instilled a “presumption against disposal”, and because nearly all disposals have been done on pragmatic grounds of saving costs or space, with no coherent intellectual framework within which to justify them. What is needed is a review of the philosophy underpinning museum collecting and an examination of whether it still serves us well. The literature on cultural heritage and the anthropology of memory provides a framework for challenging the notion that museums still function as repositories of objects and specimens that represent an objective record or collective memory. Instead, they should be seen for what they are: partial, historically contingent assemblages that reflect the tastes and interests of both the times and the individuals who made them. The intellectual framework put forward allows us not to be solely beholden by the collecting decisions of our predecessors, but to re-work these object “memories” and to choose to “forget” some of them through disposal. Finally, some of the practical implications of this framework are examined. It does not mean that museums can dispose of anything they choose, but it does mean that, instead of treating all collections as having equal importance, the ascription of value must become a fundamental part of curatorship. A number of existing schemes that do this are summarized, and some prospects for future development are outlined. © 2008, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","collecting; collections; forgetting; museums; sustainability",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"(2002) UK museum needs assessment: A report by the Heritage Lottery Fund and Resource, , London: ABL Cultural Consulting; Ainslie, P., Deaccessioning as a collections management tool (2004) Museums and the future of collecting, pp. 235-241. , Knell S., (ed), 2nd, Aldershot, UK: Ashgate,.

The reflection is informed by the ESRC funded investigation of the Cultural Capital and Social Exclusion project, CCSE, which assessed the applicability to Britain of Pierre Bourdieu's work in Distinction (1984), 40 years after his original French study. While exploring the broader thesis the project probes and disagrees with many elements of Bourdieu's arguments. This article outlines the main thesis about how cultural capacity affects the structure of social inequality and explores how this takes shape in the current British context. After considering the broader picture emerging from the interplay of various cultural fields, based on Multiple Correspondence Analysis, the discussion focuses on the field of visual art. This has the aim to reflect about the links that this field has with broader cultural processes in the UK and its specificities. The field of visual art appears as one of the most distinctive fields of cultural practices, and one where the intensity of participation is highly relevant for social position. The engagements of individuals indicate powerful tensions in the ways people conceive visual art. Cultural capital is relevant for the kind and level of involvement in this field with individuals being positioned predominantly according to possession of cultural capital, but with inflections linked to particular demographics where divisions of gender, age and ethnicity, as well as biographical patterns are significant. These are mixed in different ways as resources for social position in the field of visual art. © 2008, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Bourdieu; cultural capital; cultural participation; social position; visual art",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Bennett, T., Frow, J., (2008) The Sage handbook of cultural analysis, , Bennett T., Frow J., (eds), London: Sage, and, Edited by; Bennett, T., Savage, M., Silva, E., Warde, A., Gayo-Cal, M., Wright, D., Culture, class, distinction, , in press, London: Routledge; Bennett, T., Silva, E., Cultural capital and social exclusion (2006) Cultural Trends, 15. , Bennett T., Silva E., (eds), (Whole 2–3), and,.

The relationship between the land-use development system and arts and cultural policy has lacked specific provision guidance or standards. This is in contrast to other areas of leisure and recreation, such as parks and open spaces, sports facilities and libraries. In large part this is due to the discretionary nature of much arts provision and also the fact that there is no single type of provider. Arts facilities and activity are delivered directly and indirectly by local and county councils, community and independent not-for-profit arts organizations–large and small–and private enterprises in the commercial entertainment and cultural industries. The absence of planning guidance and comparable data to assess the need for, and location of, a range of cultural amenities has also hampered an equitable, distributory planning approach. However, renewed interest in amenity planning and the role of cultural activity and opportunity in “place making” is evident internationally, and in the UK in particular, as new housing growth areas, demographic change and population increases require the planning of social as well as physical infrastructure on a scale not experienced since the last major new town developments. This article reviews the evolution of arts and cultural planning in the UK, including an assessment of recent concepts, guidance and resources in the UK and elsewhere. Cultural mapping and planning approaches are then demonstrated in housing growth areas, followed by a proposed methodology and framework for populating the cultural map. Finally, conclusions are made on the state of data and policy integration in what continues to be a fragmented cultural system. © 2008, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","cultural mapping; cultural planning; housing growth areas",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"(2004) Developing a performance profile for local authority cultural services, , London: Department for Culture Media and Sport; (1997) Study into the employment effects of the arts lottery in England, , March, March, London: Author, (Research Rep. 14, G.L.

Hypotheses unsupported by evidence are modified or abandoned. The framers and testers of scientific hypotheses are members of the same profession, similarly trained and likely to interpret evidence in similar ways. They have professionally generalized responsibility for the quality and integrity of each other's work. Peer review systems are in place to monitor performance and expose chicanery. This is not the case in the cultural policy research arena. Here, policymakers, arts advocates and academic policy analysts are breeds apart. Their professional affiliations and lines of accountability are radically unlike. We have highly selective “advocacy” evidence on the one hand; highly developed but untestable academic theory on the other, suggesting the hypothetical existence of evidence for which academics are not allowed to look. Policymakers avoid “what if?” questions because they are paid to maintain positions of certainty. Academics ask, but lack the data to answer. Neither approach is satisfactory for shaping the future. This paper explains how the two opposing research traditions came into being and points to some of the problems which poor communication between theoreticians and practitioners can create. © 2008, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","cultural economics; cultural policy; cultural policy drivers; Cultural Trends conference; hypothetico-deductive research method; Titanic",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Abbing, H., Support for artists (2003) A handbook of cultural economics, pp. 437-444. , Towse R., (ed), Cheltenham, UK: Edward Elgar,.

The specific characteristics of the cultural policy sector are shown to have mediated these changes and, consequently, how instrumentalization has been introduced, and managed, within it.

In 2006 Arts Council England set out to address this through a major public inquiry. The inquiry involved research and consultation to explore how members of the public value the arts and their priorities for public funding. This article describes how participants approached the question of value in different contexts and how views shifted over the course of the inquiry. It shows how initial views focused on the “intrinsic” value of the arts that people experience as individual consumers. Introducing the concept of public funding prompted a move to more “instrumental” concerns. The process of deliberation resulted in a balanced view, where the arts were seen to make a positive contribution to society providing the experience is enriching and enjoyed by large and diverse numbers of people. The article concludes by considering some of the policy implications of the findings and highlighting the need for the Arts Council to build legitimacy through ongoing dialogue and debate. © 2008, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","arts policy; deliberation; instrumentalism; public value",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"(2008) Great art for everyone 2008–11, , London: Author; Belfiore, E., Art as a means towards alleviating social exclusion: Does it really work?

Successful cultural organizations serve the specific needs of audiences while maximizing the flexibility and ingenuity of their relationships, both inside and outside the organization, all within the context of the economic, social and political realities in which they exist. Success should not be limited to a single set of outcomes, but requires excellence in three basic areas: (1) Support of the Public Good, which includes accomplishing one's cultural/aesthetic mission, but also being a good community citizen; (2) Organizational Investment, including building and nurturing staff; supporting a climate and culture for creativity, innovation, collaboration and research and development; and (3) Financial Stability, including building organizational value and, when possible, generating annual financial surpluses that can be used to further support institutional learning and the public good.

It is also a key objective of the Department of Culture, Media and Sport. The need for evidence based policy in this area has led to the production of a number of new data sources, including the commissioning of the Taking Part survey, an in-depth survey of how people in England attend and participate in the arts, and the “arts debate”, a wide-reaching programme of qualitative research and consultation into people's attitudes to the arts and their funding. This article examines the benefits and pitfalls of the different kinds of data available, and what these new sources of evidence add to policy makers' understanding of how people engage with the arts in England. In particular, it explores how findings from the arts debate complement and build on the quantitative findings from Taking Part, and what implications this has for future research priorities. © 2008, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","attendance; audiences; engagement; participation; qualitative; quantitative",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"(1996) Responses to the annual survey of regularly funded organizations, , Analysis of unpublished raw data; (2003) Arts enter new era of growth, , London: Arts Council England, [Press release], 25 March; (2006) Our agenda for the arts, , http://www.artscouncil.org.uk/aboutus/agenda.php, Retrieved February 27, 2008 from; Baker, T., Maitland, H., (2002) Profile of dance attenders in Scotland.

The country-wide index of inequality separates funding differences across regions from disparities within regions. Using data on private investment in UK cultural organisations, we consider three datasets: the first includes 139 organisations between 1993 and 2005; the second includes 573 organisations between 2002 and 2005; the third includes 898 organisations between 2005 and 2006. Differences among the 12 UK regions account for between a quarter and a third of overall funding inequalities. The largest contributor to funding inequality of cultural institutions in the UK is the degree of heterogeneity among cultural organisations within each region. We find that successful private fundraising is not significantly associated with the region where the organisation operates or with the particular cultural expression object of its activity. These are significant findings for cultural policymakers working on addressing issues of regional concentration of culture and diversifying sources of funding for the sector. © 2008, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","cultural policy; private funding of culture; regional distribution",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Andreoni, J., Payne, A., Do government grants to private charities crowd out giving or fund-raising?

Instead, we need for academics, policy makers and practitioners to jointly invest their reputation, resources and know-how in: (1) settling the unavoidable differences in argot that comes with inter-disciplinary work; (2) fully contextualizing any cultural policy research within existing policy and political constraints; and (3) selecting a number of inevitably insufficient and unsatisfactory models to then apply them to support performance management, communications strategies and, more importantly, innovation in the museums and gallery sector. This would require a more pragmatic approach from all parties involved and even changes in some of our existing funding schemes and approaches. But the museums sector cannot afford pursuing another dead duck in cultural policy research. As we spend valuable time debating on the need for new models, the very sustainability of the sector is at risk. For measuring and articulating the value and impact of the sector is more than an academic exercise: given the policy, financial and business structures in which most cultural organizations operate in England, rightly selecting, rigorously measuring and powerfully articulating the value and impact of the sector is one of the key pre-requisites for its sustainability. © 2008, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","galleries; impact; inter-disciplinary research; museums; value",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Belfiore, E., Bennett, O., Rethinking the Social impacts of the arts (2007) International Journal of Cultural Policy, 13 (2), pp. 135-151; Belfiore, E., Bennett, O., Determinants of impact: Towards a better understanding of encounters with the arts (2007) Cultural Trends, 16 (3), pp. 225-275; Blaug, M., (1980) The methodology of economics, , Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press; (2005) New directions in social policy: Developing the evidence base for museums, libraries and archives in England, , http://research.mla.gov.uk/evidence/view-publication.php?dm=nrm&pubid=254, Retrieved September 5, 2008, from; Horton, S., Spence, J., (2006) Scoping the economic impact of archives, , http://research.mla.gov.uk/evidence/view-publication.php?dm=nrm&pubid=642, Retrieved September 5, 2008, from; Ridge, M., O'Flaherty, D., Caldwell-Nichols, A., Bradley, R., Howell, C., (2007) A framework for evaluating cultural policy investment, , http://www.culture.gov.uk/images/research/Aframeworkforevaluatingculturalpolicyinvestmentmainreport.pdf, Retrieved July 31, 2008, from; Snowball, J., (2008) Measuring the value of culture: Methods and examples in cultural economics, , Berlin: Springer Verlag; Stanziola, J., (2008) Supporting the development of MLA's sustainability vision: Economic impact methodologies and capacity of the sector–Research briefing, , http://research.mla.gov.uk/evidence/view-publication.php?dm=nrm&pubid=900, Retrieved September 5, 2008, from; Wavell, C., Baxter, G., Johnson, I., Williams, D., (2002) Impact evaluation of museums, archives and libraries: Available evidence project, , http://research.mla.gov.uk/evidence/view-publication.php?dm=nrm&pubid=292, Retrieved September 5, 2008, from","Stanziola, J.; Museums, Libraries and Archives Council, London, United Kingdom; email: Javier.Stanziola@mla.gov.uk",,,,,,,,09548963,,,,"English","Cult.

This article uses data from a new survey called ‘Taking Part’ to analyse patterns of arts engagement among older people (defined as those aged 55 and over) and the reasons for and barriers to older people engaging with the arts. While levels of engagement generally decline among older groups, those aged 55–74 make up a substantial part of the audience for a number of arts events including classical music, opera and craft exhibitions. Indeed, the analysis shows that the 55–64 age cohort is among the most actively involved with the arts. Adults in older age groups also engage with the arts, participating in a range of activities including crafts, reading and watching arts programmes on TV. When analysed further, socio-demographic factors including gender, disability status and socio-economic status emerge as important predictors of arts engagement among older people. Data on motivations and attitudes show that older people engage in the arts for enjoyment, relaxation, to see a specific performer or event and for a sense of a social occasion. In terms of barriers to arts engagement, time is less of an issue for older people, while the impact of poor health (particularly among people with a limiting disability) and the lack of social networks and transport is intensified among older age groups. The article closes with a consideration of the implications for arts engagement among older people of a number of projected future trends, including continuing population ageing and increasing average number of years spent in poor health, increasing Internet use, the narrowing of gender inequalities in life expectancy, the growth in ethnic minority representation among older people and pension reform. © 2007, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Ageing; Arts; Attendance; Cultural Policy; Older People; Participation",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"(2007) The art of volunteering: Taking Part survey findings on volunteering in the arts, , http://www.artscouncil.org.uk/aboutus/project_detail.php?sid=13&id=373&page=2, London: Arts Council England, (Taking Part survey briefing 2).

A building or site's historic character and economic value can be successfully preserved only if the building is well managed, maintained and conserved by the owner. Therefore, it is in the interest of the owner, to require anyone using such property to pay towards the costs through the collection of a monument annuity. The introduction of monument annuity in Croatia has already had a considerable effect on the amount available for expenditure on maintaining the cultural heritage. An annuity is a payment for the use of a fixed resource, such as land, natural resources or in this case a cultural monument. The theory of annuities has been developed by numerous economic theorists, primarily examining land annuities. The monument annuity provides an economic basis for collecting assets for the consumption of the monument in terms of its attributes and represents a pecuniary equivalent for direct and/or indirect monument consumption. It also regulates monument consumption and stimulates the owner to manage the monument with a view to its preservation. The concept of monument annuity represents an economic instrument through which the economic value of the monument is asserted on the market. Through its functions the annuity enables the management of protected built heritage as well as the realization of the most important objective of protection, not only the preservation of the monument value, but also the ‘wise use’ of built heritage in economic development. © 2007, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Conservation; Protection of Cultural Heritage",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Antolović, J., Nepokretni spomenici kulture i turizam (1997) Acta Turistica, 9 (2). , Ekonomski fakultet Zagreb; Antolović, J., (1998) Ekonomsko vrednovanje graditeljske baštine, , Zagreb, Croatia: Mikrorad; Antolović, J., Kada kultura—stvara poslove?

As redundant and unused churches are the focus of vandalism and decay, owners and heritage managers are looking for options to adaptively re-use such buildings. This article reviews the literature on the re-use of churches in the Netherlands, which has long history of innovatively addressing the problems. The options available range from re-use for religious purposes by other denominations or faiths, to community use (multi-purpose, sport, music etc.), and private use, which can be either commercial or residential. The attitudes of the community and the original property owners play a major part in successful adaptive re-use. Because of its long history, the Dutch experience in adaptive re-use of religious buildings has much to offer heritage managers in other countries faced with this emergent management issue. © 2007, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Cultural Policy; Heritage Management; Sacral Architecture",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Ambachtsheer, H., de Booij, R., (1979) Goddeloze Kerken.

More typically, cultural prizes are examined as they relate to the process of cultural valorization or are used to construct samples of venerated cultural products or producers for subsequent analysis. However, embedding cultural goods and distinctions in the career trajectories of cultural producers provides important neglected context. The example of the Academy Awards, the equivalent of a promotion in film acting, demonstrates the usefulness of the perspective. The research concludes that previously understood gendered age disparities are linked to earlier life course events, social networks, and structural factors that govern access to the career track.

A central theme is the inadequacy of the ‘homology’ argument, claiming that social hierarchies and cultural hierarchies map closely onto each other. This argument is shown to be empirically unsound and to underestimate the complexity of the relationship between social stratification and cultural consumption, as this is determined by the combined effects of income, education and social status. One question that then arises is what policy response, if any, is required by the fact that many individuals do not participate extensively in the arts even though they have the economic and cultural resources required to do so (self-exclusion rather than social exclusion). And a second is that of how far, in attempts at increasing participation, status-linked motivations might be exploited. © 2007, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Cultural Consumption; Omnivores; Social Status",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Bourdieu, P., (1984) Distinction: A social critique of the judgement of taste, , London: Routledge & Kegan Paul; Chan, T.W., Goldthorpe, J.H., Is there a status order in contemporary British society?

It postulates that a better grasp of the interaction between the individual and the work of art is the necessary foundation for a genuine understanding of how the arts can affect people. Through a critique of philosophical and empirical attempts to capture the main features of the aesthetic encounter, the article draws attention to the gaps in our current understanding of the responses to art. It proposes a classification and exploration of the factors—social, cultural and psychological—that contribute to shaping the aesthetic experience, thus determining the possibility of impact. The ‘determinants of impact’ identified are distinguished into three groups: those that are inherent to the individual who interacts with the artwork; those that are inherent to the artwork; and ‘environmental factors’, which are extrinsic to both the individual and the artwork. The article concludes that any meaningful attempt to assess the impact of the arts would need to take these ‘determinants of impact’ into account, in order to capture the multidimensional and subjective nature of the aesthetic experience. © 2007, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Aesthetic experience; Arts impacts assessment; Audience research; Reception; Transformative powers of the arts",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Abercrombie, N., Longhurst, B., (1998) Audiences, , London: Sage; Anderson, K., Smith, S.J., Editorial: Emotional geographies (2001) Transactions of the Institute of British Geographers, 26 (1), pp. 7-10; (2003) Ambition for the arts 2003–2006, , London: Arts Council England; (2003) Focus on cultural diversity: The arts in England.

It takes as a starting point that television audiences do not experience news or documentary or reality TV in isolation but as part of a range of factual and reality programmes. Factual and reality programming includes a broad understanding of non-fictional programming on broadcast television, satellite, cable and digital television. The breakdown of factual and reality programming into specific genres includes news, current affairs, documentary, and reality programmes, with further sub genres applied within each of these categories. This article critically examines genre evaluation. The quantitative research in this article is based on two national representative surveys conducted in Britain and Sweden. In both Britain and Sweden, programme makers have moved towards a reliance on popular factual genres. In Britain this is across all channels, and in Sweden this is mainly concentrated on commercial channels. Whilst there is still a commitment to news, there is an increasing use of hybrid genres in an attempt to popularise factual output. The impact of this changing generic environment on audiences is that in both countries viewers have reacted by drawing a line between traditional and contemporary factual genres. It is precisely because of the redrawing of the factual map that viewers rely on traditional ways of evaluating genres as public and informative, or popular and entertaining. The data provides evidence that contributes to existing debate on television genre, public service broadcasting, and media literacy skills. The central argument in this article is that genre evaluation is connected with wider socio-cultural discourses on public service broadcasting and popular culture, and that these are common social and cultural values that are shared by national audiences in two Northern European countries. © 2007, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Audiences; Factual Television; Genre; Genre Evaluation; Popular Culture; Public Service Broadcasting; Reality TV; Television",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Asp, K., (2005) Svenskt TV-utbud 2004, , Stockholm, Sweden: Granskningsnämnden för radio och TV; Barnett, S., Dover, C., (2004) The world on the box: International issues in news and factual programmes on UK television 1975–2003, , London, UK: (Report 3WE), 3WE; Bolin, G., Forsman, M., (2002) Bingolotto: produktion, text, reception, , Huddinge, Sweden: MKV, (Mediestudier vid Södertörns högskola 2002:1; Buckingham, D., (2003) Media education: Literacy, learning and contemporary culture, , Cambridge, UK: Polity; Corner, J., (1998) Studying media: Problems of theory and method, , Edinburgh, UK: Edinburgh University Press; Corner, J., Pels, D., (2003) Media and the restyling of politics, , London: Sage, and, eds; Ellis, J., (2000) Seeing things: Television in the age of uncertainty, , London: I.

Both in terms of increasing the total number of visits to the sponsored museums and in encouraging new visitors from priority groups the policy has been a demonstrable success. The complexities of the data generated in support of free admission have hitherto, however, gone largely unexamined. This article therefore explores the ways in which government has gone about measuring the impact of its free admission policy. It traces the history of free admission to museums and galleries as a concept, before setting out the background to the reintroduction of universal free admission to those museums sponsored by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) that had introduced charging in the 1980s and 1990s. It then considers ways in which the impact of the policy can be measured, through use of the data generated by the 23 performance indicators used by DCMS in the funding agreements that it has with each of the museums. The article then considers the various factors that need to be taken into consideration in any assessment of the impact of the free admission policy, including the effect of new capital investment. The article concludes by suggesting that further work is needed to isolate the precise impact of free admission, particularly on attracting new audiences to museums and galleries. © 2007, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Free Admission; Galleries; Impact; Museums; PSA; Visits",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Benn, T., (2004) Dare to be a Daniel: Then and now, , London: Arrow; Blair, T., (2006) Labour Party conference speech, , http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/3697434.stm, 26 September, Retrieved from; Conlin, J., (2006) The nation's mantelpiece: A history of the National Gallery, , London: Pallas Athene; (2002) National Museums and Galleries: Funding and free admission, , Norwich: TSO, (HC 85; Davies, P., (2004) Is evidence-based government possible?, , http://www.policyhub.gov.uk/downloads/JerryLeeLecture1202041.pdf, London: Cabinet Office, Retrieved from; Davies, S., (2005) Still popular: Museums and their visitors 1994–2004.

This paper considers twenty different contemporary participation studies, which cover thirty-five countries (thirty-six if you distinguish the study for the United Kingdom from the study for England) plus the Canadian province of Québec. The paper is restricted to what might be described as “traditional” participation studies—random surveys of the adult population to ascertain the participation of various demographic groups in one or another cultural behavior in the previous twelve months. Typically, the results of these surveys are summarized in a participation rate—the percentage of the demographic group that has reported a particular form of participation. Collectively, the studies summarized here provide forty-five different sets of participation rates. That so many participation studies now exist for so many countries invites comparison. But what sort of comparison is possible? The paper begins with a consideration of the various definitions of “participation” and looks at the history of participation studies. I then address the issue of comparability, particularly with respect to variation in the design of participation studies. I also address the issue of facilitating the interpretation and use of participation data, which inevitably leads to the question of the extent to which the results of participation studies actually impact policy choices. Comparable data are not necessarily usable data, but neither are usable data necessarily comparable data. Differences in methodology, it turns out, severely restrict one's ability to compare responsibly. Nevertheless, it does seem possible to articulate some broad hypotheses across countries. Still, the primary conclusion is that while one should be wary of ex post harmonization of participation studies, one should also be wary of ex ante harmonization. What has been created, in the end, is a research terrain in which (cross-national) comparability is traded off against (local) usability. © 2007, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Attendance; Boundary of Analysis; Data Harmonization; International Comparison; Participation; Participation Rates; Survey Design",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Allin, P., The development of comparable European cultural statistics (2000) Cultural Trends, 37, pp. 64-75; (1995) A practical guide to arts participation research, , January, January, Washington, DC: National Endowment for the Arts, (Research Division Rep. 30; (1996) The arts: Some Australian data—The Australia Council's compendium of arts statistics, , 5th ed.)., Sydney: Australia Council; (2004) Arts and culture in Australia: A statistical overview, , Sydney: Australian Bureau of Statistics, (Rep. 4172.0; Baumol, W.J., Bowen, W.J., (1968) Performing arts: The economic dilemma, , Cambridge, MA: MIT Press; Bårdseth, A., Taule, L., (2004) Culture statistics 2002/Kulturstatistikk 2002, , January, January, Oslo: Statistics Norway; (2004) 2002 survey of public participation in the arts, , March, March, Washington, DC: National Endowment for the Arts, (Research Division Rep. 45; Bennett, T., Emmison, M., Frow, J., (1999) Accounting for tastes: Australian everyday cultures, , Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press; Bennett, T., Silva, E.B., Culture, tastes and social divisions in contemporary Brita (2006) Cultural Trends, 15. , Bennett T., Silva E.B., (eds), and,.

So far only major cultural organisations in London have been able to successfully diversify their funding portfolio. A drop in public funding is likely to make it even more challenging for a large proportion of cultural organisations to close their income gap. To ensure the successful development of policies of funding decentralisation and inform organisational strategies, more theory-based empirical research on trends, drivers and motivations, and models of funding sustainability is needed. One of the many factors preventing the development of this line of research is a wide gap between research conducted for advocacy purposes and academia in the UK. This paper illustrates the extent and implications of this gap by providing a brief summary of the academic literature in the field and reviewing methods and results of existing data collection efforts by advocacy organisations, in particular the Private Investment in Culture survey by Arts & Business UK (A&B). The scope of this paper has been limited to business funding in the form of cash and in-kind sponsorship, donations and membership, since there is relatively more cross-sectional time series data and academic and advocacy studies of this form of funding than of individual giving and trust and foundation support. The paper proposes recommendations on ways of closing this gap, in particular by improving existing sampling methodology for this type of data collection and expanding and strengthening the existing academic research on motivations, market dynamics and concentration of business funding. © 2007, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Corporate Philanthropy; Cultural Funding; Cultural Statistics; Sponsorship",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Andreoni, J., Payne, A., Do government grants to private charities crowd out giving or fund-raising?

Eschewing the notion of funding based on ‘public good’, successive iterations of public sector reform have progressively required museums to prove that they are worthy of public support. Notions of ‘worth’ have increasingly been tied to the achievement of government policy and enforced through making attainment of key policy directions a condition of funding agreements. Current government policy aimed at ‘building social capital’ in both the Britain and Australia expects museums to prove that they ‘make a difference’ in terms of long-term social impact. However, unease over the imbalance created by what many perceive to be an overly ‘instrumental’ approach to assessing the role of museums has generated growing criticism and a parallel conversation about ‘intrinsic value’.

It constructs what Bourdieu calls a space of lifestyles from evidence collected in a national random sample survey of the British population in 2003. MCA constructs the space relationally on the basis of similarities and differences in responses to questions about a large number of cultural items in several sub‐fields including music, reading, TV and recreational activity. These items are mapped along two axes and their clustering indicates affinities between tastes and practices across sub‐fields. The cultural patterns are described. We then superimpose socio‐demographic variables, including class, educational qualifications and age, the distribution of which indicates tendencies for certain categories of person to have shared tastes. The analysis reveals meaningful, socially differentiated patterns of taste. The space of lifestyles proves to be structured primarily by the total volume of capital (resources) held by respondents and by age. Strong oppositions are revealed. An older, educated middle class shares ‘legitimate’ established cultural preferences. The repertoire of a younger middle class group contains more contemporary and ‘popular’ items. Less well‐educated, working class groups are characterised often primarily by lack of cultural participation, but also, especially among the young, by an aversion to ‘legitimate’ culture. © 2006, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Bourdieu; Cultural capital, Multiple correspondence analysis; Space of lifestyles",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Abbott, A., (2001) Time matters, , Chicago, Il: University of Chicago Press; Bellah, R., (1996) Habits of the heart: Individualism and commitment in American life, , Berkeley, CA: University of California Press; Bennett, T., Savage, M., Silva, A., Warde, A., Gayo‐Cal, M., Wright, D., Culture, Capital, Distinction, , London: Routledge, (forthcoming; Bourdieu, P., (1984) Distinction, , London: Routledge; Chan, T., Goldthorpe, J.H., Social Stratification and Cultural consumption: music in England European Sociological Review, , University of Oxford, (forthcoming), and,.

The focus is on participation in different sorts of leisure activities. It is assumed that leisure has to be related to some sort of activity, and is not equivalent to free time. Bourdieu's ideas about social class as the main factor structuring cultural practices are engaged with. In order to do this, the Cultural Capital and Social Exclusion (CCSE) survey data are analysed, following three steps. First, frequency of participation in different leisure activities is described and these results are compared with those produced by the Arts Council of England's 2001 attendance, participation and attitudes survey. Second, the relationship among the different leisure items is studied using a three-factor solution, as a result of a principal component analysis. Third, regressions are run on the factor scores in order to provide an explanation of the identified dimensions. Attention is paid to occupational class, gender, ethnic origin, education, and age as explanatory variables. The results show that all of these have some effects, though to a different extent and for different factors, the most important being level of education, age and gender. © 2006, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Bourdieu; Cultural capital; Culture; Leisure; Participation",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Critcher, C., Gramham, P., Tomlinson, A., (1995) Sociology of leisure.

Like other items in the cultural repertoire, paintings, as major examples of visual art, imply social divisions in how they are engaged with by artists, critics and audiences. Within the Bourdieusian framework, cultural engagements with paintings are interpreted as indicators of social position, since appreciation depends on a trained capacity in the family and the educational system, which is often inaccessible to less powerful sections of the population. This would imply that the sorts of paintings favoured by working-class people differ from those preferred by the middle or upper classes. More recent studies have contested the view that a gulf exists between the art tastes of different classes in ways that reproduce the class structure. The argument of the omnivore thesis that distinctions between more popular and legitimate tastes have become blurred has predominantly been based on empirical references in the field of music. This article explores this thesis on the basis of data about visual arts in the Cultural Capital and Social Exclusion project. While some differences continue to be connected to social divisions of income, education and occupational groups, important similarities are found across the board, and certain significant differences appear to relate to factors other than social class, such as ethnicity, age and gender. It is also significant that some people appear disconnected from and disinterested in paintings. © 2006, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Bourdieu; Cultural consumption; Social divisions; Visual art",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Benjamin, W., The work of art in the age of mechanical reproduction (1937) Illuminations, , New York: Schocken Books, Essay Benjamin, W,.

In recent decades body management techniques have become a very conspicuous aspect of self-presentation and have been served by the expansion of the supply of commercial services to deal with diet and health, physical training and cosmetic improvement to appearances. The professionalization and commercialization of sport have also accelerated. Bourdieu interpreted measures for body management and maintenance in terms of the accumulation and display of cultural capital. He distinguished three types of cultural capital: institutionalized, objectified and embodied. This article considers some of the elements of the very complex and extensive property, embodied cultural capital. The Cultural Capital and Social Exclusion (CCSE) survey included questions on sporting activity, sports spectatorship and physical exercise routines, important elements in the mosaic of contemporary cultural activities. This article teases out the patterns of participation and taste in this area, examining differentiation by class, gender, education, ethnic and age groups in particular. While showing that all these factors matter, gender is the most important source of differentiation, though this is more the case for sport than for exercise per se.

Historically, popular reading has been linked with contested processes of social change. Tastes for reading have, following Bourdieu, been seen as embedded in continuing processes of distinction and the making of hierarchies. Research has demonstrated the ways in which these hierarchies might be reflective of gender as well as of class relationships. This article examines the findings of the Cultural Capital and Social Exclusion study in the light of these debates. The survey gathered data about the types of reading material used by a representative sample of the United Kingdom (UK) population, including their preferences for newspapers, magazines and books. The article reports on a number of possible relationships identified in the study about the location of reading as a social practice, drawing on the survey data and explanatory accounts of respondents' reading preferences drawn from focus groups and interviews. The regularity of participation in reading and ownership of books are outlined in relation to occupational class. Evidence relating to the reading of magazines and newspapers is then examined in the light of contemporary policy concerns. Patterns of taste in books are explored, examining preferences for ‘literary’ genres, gender, education and ethnicity. The article concludes by addressing the position of taste for, and knowledge of, specific works representing a range of positions within the literary field to complete the picture of cultural capital and the literary field in the contemporary UK. © 2006, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Cultural capital; Reading; Social exclusion",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Bennett, T., (1990) Outside literature, , London: Routledge; Bennett, T., Emmison, M., Frow, J., (1999) Accounting for tastes: Australian everyday cultures, , Cambridge: Cambridge University Press; Bloom, C., (2002) Bestsellers: Popular fiction since 1900, , London: Palgrave; Bourdieu, P., (1984) Distinction: A social critique of the judgement of taste, , London: Routledge; Carey, J., (1992) The intellectuals and the masses, , London: Faber; (2003) Framework for the future, , London: The Stationary Office; Fowler, B., (1991) The alienated reader: Women and popular romantic literature in the twentieth century, , Hemel Hempstead: Harvester Wheatsheaf; Gelder, K., (2004) Popular fiction: The logic and practice of a literary field, , London: Routledge; Jermyn, H., (2001) The arts and social exclusion: A review prepared for the Arts Council of England, , London: The Arts Council; Long, E., (2003) Book clubs: Women and the uses of reading in everyday life, , Chicago, IL: University of Chicago Press; (2005) Every which way we can: A literacy and social inclusion position paper, , http://www.literacytrust.org.uk/socialinclusion/policychallenge.html, Retrieved October 25, 2005, from the National Literacy Trust website; Peterson, R.A., Kern, R., Changing highbrow taste: From snob to omnivore (1996) American Sociological Review, 61, pp. 900-909; (2004) Most borrowed authors, , http://www.plr.uk.com/enhancedindex.htm, Retrieved December 17, 2004, from Public Lending Right website; Radway, J., (1984) Reading the romance: Women patriarchy and popular literature, , Chapel Hill, NC: University of North Carolina; Rose, J., (2001) The intellectual life of the British working classes, , New Haven, CT: Yale University Press; Rubin, J.S., (1992) The making of middlebrow culture, , London: University of North Carolina Press; Thompson, J.B., (2005) Books in the digital age, , Cambridge: Polity; Vincent, D., (1981) Bread, knowledge and freedom: A study of nineteenth century working class autobiography, , London: Methuen; Williams, R., (1961) The long revolution, , Harmondsworth: Penguin","Wright, D.; CRESC, Sociology Discipline, Faculty of Social Sciences, The Open University, Walton Hall, Milton Keynes, MK7 6AA, United Kingdom; email: d.a.v.wright@open.ac.uk",,,,,,,,09548963,,,,"English","Cult.

It shows that musical taste is highly divided and contentious, with large numbers of people intensely disliking certain genres of music. It shows the existence of two distinctive musical taste communities, one linking taste for rock, electronic, urban, world and heavy metal music, and the other linking classical music and jazz. Tastes for specific musical works do not easily map onto musical genres, and are less closely correlated with each other.

These include the tensions between a set of policies for global media businesses versus the support for small firms in local economic development (Gilmore, 2004; Hesmondhalgh & Pratt, 2005), and the tension between citizens and consumers in media and cultural policy (Hesmondhalgh, 2005). Equally apparent are the tensions between economic development of these sectors and social inclusion. In the UK, arguably more than other countries, the rhetoric of Creative Industries has been tied into political ideas about the links between economic competitiveness and social inclusion. The stated aims for creative industry development have thus been twofold—to increase jobs and GDP, while simultaneously ameliorating social exclusion and countering long-standing patterns of uneven economic development. Research, however, suggests that supporting the creative industries is, at best, a problematic way of tackling the issues of economic and social exclusion. The effects of gentrification on creative industry working and living space (Evans & Shaw, 2004); the patterns of informal hiring and career progression in these sectors (Leadbeater & Oakley, 2001) and the concentration of much economic activity in London and the South East, all suggest that the development of these sectors might exacerbate rather than address patterns of economic inequality. © 2006, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Citizenship; Creative Industries; Cultural Policy; Economic Development; Regeneration; Social Inclusion",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Adams, J., Vigor, A., Robinson, P., (2003) A new regional policy for the UK, , London: Institute for Public Policy Research; Barry, B., (2005) Why social justice matters, , Cambridge, UK: Polity Press; Blair, T., (2006) Speech launching the ‘Respect Action Plan’, , http://www.number-10.gov.uk/output/Page8898.asp, Retrieved 20 January 2006, from; Clarke, J., New Labour's citizens: Activated, empowered, responsibilized, abandoned?

This article, by contrast, examines the respects in which practices of distinction are operative within the space of broadcast television. Looking first at the ‘internal economy’ of television as expressed in the relations between genre, programme and channel preferences, it then examines how these preferences are related to occupational class, gender, level of education and ethnicity. While showing that divisions within the space of broadcasting are most powerfully articulated in terms of age and gender, the article also shows that occupational class and level of education play important roles in stratifying television audiences along traditional ‘high’/‘low’ lines. A closer analysis of the relations between these variables reveals more complex patterns of distinction, particularly in the place occupied by ‘new drama’ and ‘new comedy’ in the preferences of younger, well-educated viewers. © 2006, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Audience; Broadcast television; Cultural capital; Genre; Media field; Social distinction",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Bennett, T., Emmison, M., Frow, J., (1999) Accounting for tastes: Australian everyday cultures, , Cambridge: Cambridge University Press; Bennett, T., Savage, M., Silva, E.B., Warde, A., Gayo-Cal, M., Wright, D., (2006) Media culture: The organisation of the media field in contemporary Britain, , London: British Film Institute; Benson, R., Neveu, E., (2005) Bourdieu and the Journalistic field, , Cambridge: Polity Press; Bjarkman, L., To have and to hold: The video collector's relationship with an ethereal medium (2004) Television & New Media, 5 (3), pp. 217-246; Born, G., Strategy, positioning and projection in digital television: Channel Four and the commercialisation of public service broadcasting in the UK (2003) Media, Culture & Society, 25, pp. 773-799; Bourdieu, P., (1984) Distinction: A social critique of the judgement of taste, , London: Routledge & Kegan Paul; Bourdieu, P., (1998) On television and Journalism, , London: Pluto Press; (2004) Building public value, , London: British Broadcasting Corporation; Caldwell, J.T., (1995) Televisuality: Style, crisis, and authority in American television, , New Brunswick, NJ: Rutgers University Press; DiMaggio, P., Mukhtar, T., Arts participation as cultural capital in the United States, 1982–2002: Signs of decline?

Existing techniques for both user and community consultation are limited with front end evaluation particularly undeveloped in the sector, often providing no meaningful base by which to compare project outcomes. Tension exists between government, which values quantitative data, and researchers who argue qualitative methods are more appropriate for evaluating community projects. This article reports a pilot study using the repertory grid technique to examine a ‘socially excluded’, ethnically diverse local community's perceptions, expectations and previous experiences of similar projects, to provide a benchmark against which to compare outcomes. This research formed part of the front end evaluation for a New Deal for Community's Project run by Sheffield Galleries and Museums Trust. The repertory grid technique was developed in psychological studies as a means of understanding respondents' own world views, and is particularly helpful in working with people with poor language skills. Although this study only used the technique qualitatively, it can be used to combine both quantitative and qualitative data, providing more robust data for evidence-based policy decisions. Using the repertory grid technique, respondents were able to list both perceived and practical barriers to participation in projects.

These were established to contribute to regional development and to deliver the DCMS's national policy goals. The paper examines the RCCs' remit, challenges, achievements and prospects, and locates these in wider debates about evidence-based policy and continuity and change in cultural and regional policy.

Literatures on corporate giving rationales, concepts of disaster and donor activity in disasters provide an underpinning. The article seeks to make connections between this high profile if short-lived business giving and the funding of the arts that is sought from business; and to draw tentative lessons for arts funding when seeking business support. The giving accounts in the wake of the Tsunami from a non-probability sample1 of 56 UK companies and 16 non-UK companies were examined. Reported online to the UK charity Business in the Community, these accounts were accessed in February 2005 and scrutinized thematically. Concurrently, company financial profiles to accompany giving figures were constructed. Although linkages between donation levels and financial performance were lacking, emerging themes included the role of employees, influencing company giving and creating a climate of expectation of firms' contributions. These developments may have important implications for business funding for the arts, where leading philanthropists are prominent as individuals in the giving landscapes; but employees' collective involvement is not marked. Alternatively, cultivation of employees as would-be donors, indirectly via their firms, may be a more secure, if lower level route to funding for some arts organizations than dependence on high profile business leaders. The article considers alternative scenarios for company giving in disaster contexts, including as a sustained and lasting giving theme or as company support as a ‘one-off’ event, rock-star style. The likely development of employee power as a key element in company giving is explored; and its wider meanings for funding in arts settings, (where the giver as rock star heroine/hero is also prominent) are considered. © 2006, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Arts Funding; Corporate Giving; Corporate Philanthropy; Disaster Grant Making; Employee Giving",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Abshire, M., Surviving ‘corporate adversity’ (2004) Corporate Philanthropy Report, 19 (4), pp. 2-3; Aronson, J., A pragmatic view of thematic analysis (1992) The Qualitative Report, 2 (1). , http://www.nova.edu.sss/QR/BackIssues?QR-2?aronson.html, Retrieved from; (2006) Private Investment Benchmarking Survey 2004/5: Summary report, , http://www.aandb.org.uk, Retrieved 27 February, 2006, from; Bennett, R., Factors underlying the inclination to donate to particular types of charity (2003) International Journal of Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector Marketing, 8 (1), pp. 12-29; Burlingame, D.F., Smith, C., The future of corporate giving (1999) New Directions for Philanthropic Fundraising, 26, pp. 59-77; (2005) Company support for the Tsunami Appeal., , http://www.bitc.org, Retrieved 1 February, 2005, from; (2006) 2005 percent standard results, , http://www.bitc.org.uk/ptogrammes/programme_directory/percent_club/results_2005.html, Retrieved 18 April, 2006, from; Cavicchio, C., Responding to the Asian Tsunami disaster: Applying the lessons of 9/11 (2005) onPhilanthropy, , http://www.onphilanthropy.com/bestpract/bp2005-01-12.html, Retrieved from; (2005), http://www.bitc.org.uk/news/news_directory/tsunami_support.html, Retrieved 1 February, 2005, from the BITC website; Cosgrave, J., (2005) Tsunami Evaluation Coalition: Interim findings, , http://www.odi.org.uk/ALNAP, December, Active Learning Network for Accountability and Performance Humanitarian Action (ALNAP).

The article sets out to look at some of the key findings and track any developments in the 10 years since its publication. The article examines both quantitative and qualitative evidence from national (rather than local or regional) data. The subject matter covered includes the old questions of how many visits are made to UK museums and galleries each year, who visits and why do they visit. This is a period only partly impacted upon by the policy initiatives of New Labour, notably free admission to the national museums and galleries and the Renaissance in the Regions programme. The author demonstrates that, at best, the total number of visits grew only a little and those who visit became more middle class and more middle aged rather more than the population did itself in these years. Museums and galleries might maintain their audiences but they were not expanding them or broadening their social appeal. This alone was sufficient justification for New Labour's policies, the early stages of which seem to have been successful. © 2005, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Evidence; Galleries; Museums; Statistics; Visitors; Visits",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Anderson, D., (1997) A Common wealth: Museums in the learning age, , London: The Stationery Office; Babbidge, A., UK museums safe and sound?

Comparison of the substantial data relating to the usage, governance, management and resources of museums in Rosse with the position at the end of the twentieth century shows how the museums landscape has (or has not) changed during the intervening period. Both National and non-National museums have seen their financial resources grow in a way that has outpaced Gross Domestic Product (GDP). This is both a reflection of, and stimulus for, increasing public interest in the heritage. However, the museum sector has not been the stable entity of popular perception, and museums have closed or amalgamated as well as opened and developed new projects. For most of the 40 years government policy for museums has been ad hoc, and it is only since 1997 that museums have been the subject of strategic direction, exemplified for non-National museums by the Renaissance in the Regions initiative. The £147 million to be spent on this scheme by 2007/08 represents an unmatched level of investment. However, it has focused resources on the large regional museums rather than the previous more equal distribution, increasing the risk that the museum sector will atomize rather than continue the process of coming together that had been taking place previously. Rosse's main recommendation, the creation of area museum councils, endured for 40 years. Renaissance's larger budget makes current levels of support vulnerable without some formal (perhaps legislative) framework to anchor it within government. While this approach is increasingly popular in other European nations, it still represents a challenge for cultural policy in the nations of the UK. © 2005, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","1960s; Museums; Policy; Regional; Rosse; Statistics",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Anderson, D., (1997) A common wealth: Museums in the learning age, , London: Department of National Heritage; (1998) MOD(A).

The Creative Industries Task Force Mapping Documents of 1998 and 2001 sought to define and quantify in broad terms economic activity across 13 distinct creative industries. More detailed estimates have been published by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) in successive annual Creative Industries Economic Estimates. An assessment is provided of the way in which the creative industries have been measured using the Office of National Statistics' Standard Industrial and Standard Occupational classifications (SIC and SOC). These classifications have themselves been revised since the early 1990s, and further revisions are in prospect from 2007. In this analysis particular focus is given to the ‘Designer Fashion’ sector, illustrated by a number of tables and data analyses. These actual and proposed revisions have helped in documenting the rapidly emerging creative industries, which have reportedly grown at two to three times the rate of the UK economy as a whole. However, as the Regional Culture Data Framework published in 2002 records, serious problems remain in providing valid assessments of the creative industries sectors from ‘official’ published sources, even for the UK as a whole, let alone at the regional level emphasized by the Regional Culture Data Framework's regional sponsors. In any case, often the ‘scaling factors’ applied to official SIC codes to define creative industries appear arbitrary. Many of the Regional Culture Data Framework's recommendations, notably the adoption of a more comprehensive ‘supply-chain’ approach to documenting the cultural sector, make further demands upon the existing official structural classifications and the data bases underpinning them. Even where all elements in the ‘supply chain’ are well documented, there are still questions about the validity of this approach. For example, should wholesale and retail distribution of creative industry products be regarded as part of the ‘Cultural Cycle’? In conclusion, it is suggested that the ‘official’ data has marked limitations in documenting the creative industries and does not realistically or adequately capture the more interesting and dynamic elements of an industry like ‘Designer Fashion’. This is disappointing in a context where central government has placed increasing emphasis upon evidence-based policy to support the development of the creative industries, and where the British ‘Designer Fashion’ sector has lamented the lack of central support in comparison with the French or Italian industries. It is suggested that a more customized approach to collecting data about the creative industries is needed if the results are to usefully inform the further development and profile of these sectors. © 2005, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Creative industries; Cultural economy; Culture Cycle; Designer Fashion; Official statistics; Specialist studies",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Allnutt, D., (2004) Review of tourism—Executive summary.

In this paper the primary aim is to examine, in the light of empirical results from a research project in which the authors are presently engaged, three main, and rival, positions that have been taken up in this debate, here labelled as the ‘homology’, the ‘individualization’ and the ‘omnivore–univore’ arguments. Elsewhere, we have concentrated on musical consumption in England, and find evidence that is broadly supportive of the omnivore–univore argument. Here we ask whether such findings are confirmed in the case of theatre, dance and cinema attendance. A secondary aim of the paper is to bring to the attention of practitioners in the field of cultural policy and administration the need to address the issues that arise through the use of more powerful methods of data analysis than those often applied in the past. We explain how indicators of theatre, dance and cinema attendance derived from the Arts in England survey of 2001 can be subject to analysis so as to reveal two distinctive patterns of attendance and, in turn, two distinctive types of consumer—who can, it turns out, be regarded as omnivores and univores, even if with some qualification. The former have relatively high rates of attendance at all kinds of the events covered, including musicals and pantomimes as well as plays and ballet, while the latter tend to be cinema-goers only, that is, non-consumers of theatre and dance. A range of measures of social inequality are then introduced into the authors' analyses, including separate measures of social class and social status and also of educational level and income, and it is further shown that, again in conformity with the omnivore–univore argument, these two types of consumer are socially stratified. Omnivores are of generally higher social status than univores and also have usually higher levels of education and higher income than do univores (the latter finding marking the main difference with musical consumption, which was unaffected by income once other stratification variables were controlled). In sum, our results for theatre, dance and cinema attendance lend, overall, further support to the omnivore–univore argument as against its rivals, but also indicate that different aspects of social inequality impact on different forms of cultural consumption in varying degrees and probably through largely separate processes. © 2005, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Cultural Consumption; Performing Arts; Social Stratification",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Bauman, Z., (1988) Freedom, , Milton Keynes: Open University Press; Berlyne, D., (1974) Studies in the new experimental aesthetics: Steps toward an objective psychology of aesthetic appreciation, , Berlyne D., (ed), Washington, DC: Hemisphere, Edited by; Bourdieu, P., (1984) Distinction: A social critique of the judgement of taste, , London: Routledge & Kegan Paul; Chan, T.W., Goldthorpe, J.H., Is there a status order in contemporary British society?

It sets out a brief history of attempts to bring forward legislation to protect such finds, charts the rise of metal detecting as an activity and describes the successful process of changing government policy through the Treasure Act 1996. This led to the Portable Antiquities Scheme which has now received full government funding. The paper looks at how this was achieved through the development of what has been described as the largest community archaeology project in the country, which is starting to change public attitudes towards objects from the past.

More, in that what they connote depends on their context and the assumptions of both user and audience. Less, in that what they denote is frequently both unclear and contested. The peculiar language of New Labour has been a matter of journalistic comment at least since 1996, and there have also been more systematic studies of the construction of a new political discourse. Flexible concepts that can be understood in different ways by different constituencies are an essential part of this discourse, and are fundamental to processes of spin and political obfuscation. This article shows how this has been true of both the ‘third way’ and of ‘social exclusion’. It moves on to argue that the concept of cultural capital poses a related problem. Dominant explanations of social exclusion rely in part on cultural explanations, while agendas of social inclusion are being promoted through the cultural sector as well as elsewhere. There is an implicit idea of ‘cultural capital’ at work here, but one that diverges sharply from its origins in the work of Pierre Bourdieu, and which has very different political implications. © 2004, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Bourdieu; Cultural capital; Discourse; New Labour; Social exclusion; Third way",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Barnett, S., Practicable socialism (1883) Longman, Green and Co, , S.

Since 1995 the HLF has given some £3 billion to 15,000 projects. As a small organization with a relatively large remit, applied research has been critical to the work of the HLF, helping it set priorities, make decisions and evaluate its programmes. Key research issues include: defining the needs of the heritage, the best means of evaluating projects and programmes, and capturing the economic and social benefits of heritage. Young people can be a difficult audience for heritage funders to reach, and it is shown how evaluation informed a dedicated new programme. The example of its support of parks shows how a need identified through research became a priority for the HLF, and has since been taken up by government. Finally, the HLF has developed a distinctive approach based on a very open concept of what heritage is and means to people. Research into public attitudes to heritage has been central to this. The DCMS cites 23 other agencies as working alongside the HLF (DCMS, 2003b, p. 6). These presumably include the national bodies who deal with the historic environment (such as English Heritage, Historic Scotland and Cadw in Wales), the natural heritage (such as English Nature or Scottish Natural Heritage) and the countryside (the Countryside Agency), and those involved with issues such as collections (Museums, Libraries and Archives, MLA) and new design (Commission for Architecture and the Built Environment, CABE). The Lottery will be reviewed in the lead up to the licence review in 2009 and inevitably questions will be asked about the future of funding. In another context, the Secretary of State has asked how it is possible to capture the value of culture. In common with organizations who deal with sports, art and culture, the HLF needs to capture the benefits of funding in a way that makes sense to both politicians and the public. Doing this depends upon robust research. © 2004, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Cultural Heritage; Historic Environment; Parks; Policy; Research; Young People",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Askwith, C., The economic contribution of historic parks, gardens and designed landscapes: A review of existing data and research and recommendations for future research (1999) Cultural Trends, 35, pp. 29-79; Barber, A., (1991) Institute of Leisure and Amenity Management, , Basildon; Bird, W., Who cares; People and nature (2003) Ecos, 24 (1), pp. 29-31; Bishop, K., Norton, A., Phillips, A., The impacts of the National Lottery on countryside (2000) Ecos, 20 (3-4), pp. 11-19; Chapman, M., Kirk, K., Carley, M., Brown, A., (2001) Community participation in Social Inclusion Partnerships, , http://www.scotland.gov.uk/cru/resfinds/drf117-00.asp, Scottish Executive Central Research Unit Development Department Research Programme 2001 Research Findings 117.

Does the leisure evidence indicate the existence of excluded groups in present-day Britain? Do any particular uses of leisure lead to the acquisition of socio-cultural assets that are convertible into, or able to expand and transform into economic assets reflected in labour market achievements? The overall pattern of leisure participation in Britain is described: the co-existence of activities in which virtually everyone is involved to some extent and in some way alongside a multitude of minority interests. The sizes of different broad types of leisure activity are then compared, and social class and age are identified as particularly useful predictors of leisure behaviour. The several ways in which leisure tastes and skills may become economic assets are then identified. The article concludes that although there may well be excluded groups in present-day Britain, the concept is unhelpful in analysing the leisure evidence, and that, although appropriate leisure can help some individuals to overcome economic disadvantages, mainstreaming invariably fails: the shape of the occupational structure is the stumbling block. © 2004, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Age differences; Cultural consumption; Leisure participation; Social class differences; Social exclusion",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"(2002), http://news.bbc.co.uk, Retrieved from, BBC; Berrett, T., Burton, T.L., Slack, T., Quality products, quality service: factors leading to entrepreneurial success in the sport and leisure industry (1993) Leisure Studies, 12, pp. 93-106; Bourdieu, P., (1984) Routledge, , London; Bourdieu, P., Passeron, J.D., (1977) Sage, , London; Bourdieu, P., Darbel, A., (1997) Polity Press, , Cambridge; Brooks-Buck, J., Anderson, E.L., African American access to higher education through sports: following a dream or perpetuating a stereotype?

A smaller, parallel body of work emphasizes much broader understandings of cultural capital in relation to education. The first part of this article maps different conceptions of cultural capital across the field of educational research before developing a conceptualization that stresses the micro-interactional processes through which individuals comply (or fail to comply) with the evaluative standards of schooling. The article also argues that the growth of policy initiatives that accentuate the role of parents in schooling have made the myriad workings of cultural capital in relation to education more visible. Within government policy parental involvement has become the means whereby schools can tap the cultural capital resources of parents in the drive to raise standards. Economic capital has always had a defining influence, but now it is increasingly possible to see the power of cultural capital especially in relation to the growing emphasis on parental involvement and parental choice, and programmes such as gifted and talented. The second part of the article draws on data from research projects that examine parental choice, gifted and talented programmes, and parental involvement more generally, to illustrate the many ways in which cultural capital operates to reproduce educational advantage. Most of the examples underscore the close relationship between cultural and economic capital and how they work to reinforce each other, but an example is also included to illustrate how cultural capital can operate independently of economic capital. The article concludes that the policy emphasis on parental involvement and initiatives to retain the middle classes within state schooling work to maximize the potential of the already advantaged and are exacerbating class inequalities in education. © 2004, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Cultural capital; Economic capital; Educational inequalities; Parents; Schools; Social class",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Aschaffenburg, K., Maas, I., Cultural and educational careers: The dynamics of social reproduction (1997) American Sociological Review, 62, pp. 573-587; Ball, S., (2003) Routledge Falmer, , London; Beck, U., (1992) Sage, , London; Bernstein, B., Education cannot compensate for society (1970) New Society, , 26 February; Bourdieu, P., Cultural reproduction and social reproduction (1977) Oxford University Press, , J.

Addressing exclusion has in fact been a perennial problem for the French ministry, because of a founding and apparently irrepressible conviction, from Malraux in the 1960s to Lang in the 1980s and 1990s, that art speaks for itself without mediation; and because of the consequent structural separation of (to use the standard French terminology) the ‘cultural’ from the ‘social’. This conviction was contested in the late 1960s—partly with the help of Bourdieu's notion of cultural capital, although since then policy agents have mostly attempted to move on from Malraux's position by taking up positions against Bourdieu. The article traces the history of these attempts, then examines in more detail the principles, problems and paradoxes of the exclusion agenda in French cultural policy today. © 2004, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Cultural policy; Democratization; France; Ministry of Culture; Social exclusion",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"(2001) Actes des Ateliers de l'intégration locale: Vers la démocratie culturelle, , Lyon).

Some of these groups have a disproportionate lower, socio-economic profile and yet at least some of these groups are more likely to pursue and achieve entry into higher education than whites, especially, their white working-class peers. They also suffer additional disadvantages such as racism and cultural marginality. Bourdieu's concept of cultural capital is designed to explain why members of a disadvantaged class achieve less educational success than an advantaged class. It is not helpful in explaining why some disadvantaged groups do better than one would have predicted on the basis of a class (and/or racism) analysis. On the other hand, US sociological studies which deploy the concept of social capital in combination with ethnicity to explain the trajectories of ‘second generation’ migrants seem promising. This conclusion is offered on the basis of a brief literature review and a suggestion that the ‘motor’ of the British South Asian and Chinese overcoming of disadvantage lies in migrant parents getting their children to internalize high educational ambitions and to enforce appropriate behaviour. © 2004, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Cultural capital; Educational qualifications; Ethnicity; Second generation; Social capital; Social mobility",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Abbas, T., (2003) University of Bristol, , November), Leverhulme Programme on Migration and Citizenship Seminar Series, Bristol; Ahmad, F., Modood, T., Lissenburgh, S., (2003) Policy Studies Institute, , London; Ballard, R., The Pakistanis: Stability and introspection (1996) HMSO, , C.

The Research and Statistics Unit draws data from both official and unofficial sources and commissions its own special-purpose studies to gather information relevant to the strategic objectives of the Council. Key tasks are the measurement of the size of the market for film and the various elements of the film value chain, the performance of films supported by the UK Film Council and the performance of UK films in general. Special-purpose research projects currently include a detailed survey of the film production workforce, a study of the economic impact of the UK screen industries and studies of the social impact of local cinemas and the experience of Black- and Minority-led film production companies. A range of industry and official partners are collaborating in these studies. The Research and Statistics Unit also provides statistical and policy analysis relating to the wider policy environment of UK film, including issues such as the future of film tax incentives. This analysis has been developed within the HM Treasury ‘Green Book’ framework with particular reference to understanding market failure in relation to film. Central to the market failure argument is the cultural value of film in both its qualitative and its quantitative aspects. UK Film Council research is placed in the context of the literature on hedonic pricing and contingent valuation. The industrial challenges of increasing cultural value are discussed. Finally, consideration is given to the potential of film to contribute directly to ‘public value’. © 2004, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Contingent Valuation; Cultural Policy; Cultural Value; Market Failure; Public Value; UK Film",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Allin, P., Statistics on film: What the official statistics show (1998) Cultural Trends, 30, pp. 5-29; Caves, R.E., (2000) Harvard University Press, , Cambridge, MA; (1998) Department for Culture, Media and Sport, , London, Department for Culture, Media and Sport; (2003) Department for Culture, Media and Sport, , London, Department for Culture, Media and Sport; (2003) The Stationery Office, , London, HM Treasury; (2003) HM Treasury, , London, HM Treasury; (2003) The Stationery Office Ltd, by authority of the House of Commons, , London, House of Commons, Culture Media and Sport Committee; Kelly, G., Muers, S., (2002) Strategy Unit, Cabinet Office, , London; Navrud, S., Ready, R.C., (2002) Edward Elgar, , Cheltenham; Papandrea, F., Willingness to pay for domestic television programming (1999) Journal of Cultural Economics, 23, pp. 149-166; (2003) UK Film Council, , London, UK Film Council; (2003) UK Film Council, , London, UK Film Council; (2004) UK Film Council, , London, UK Film Council; (2004) UK Film Council, , London, UK Film Council; (2003) UK Film Council, , London, UK Film Council & dti","Steele, D.; UK Film Council, 10 Little Portland St, London, W1W 7JG, United Kingdom; email: david.steele@ukfilmcouncil.org.uk",,,,,,,,09548963,,,,"English","Cult.

These used a broad definition of culture and recognized of the value of partnership working within localities, regions and sub-regions in which local authorities were taking the ‘lead’. It also reflected the advocacy of a cultural planning approach by central government for local government. Cultural planning encourages a culturally sensitive approach to local cultural development, focusing on a diverse range of ‘cultural resources’, including leisure and sports facilities, qualities of natural and built environment, youth and ethnic communities and communities of interest, as well as the need for different local authority service departments and private, voluntary and other public sector partners to be involved early on in strategic development. According to this approach, culture is broadly defined as a ‘way of life’, and DCMS's guidance states that Local Cultural Strategies should promote cultural well-being and the quality of life in their designated areas. As a result, Local Cultural Strategies have been developed at all tiers of English local authorities, including district and borough, metropolitan and unitary authority, county and regional levels. This article discusses the development of Local Cultural Strategies in England and reviews information on those strategies that have been developed. It examines the different approaches local authorities have taken towards this task, the methodologies for consultation employed, the frameworks for monitoring and the evaluation of cultural provision they offer. It considers the benefits and problems associated with the production of Local Cultural Strategies as strategic development frameworks for local culture, and questions the future of this process following their ‘subsumption’ into Community Strategies as part of a broader package of reforms for local government. In doing so, it examines how these documents offer an opportunity to examine local approaches to cultural planning. © 2004, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Best Value; Community strategy; Cultural planning; Cultural strategies; Local government; Modernization",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"(2004), February), Angela Watson & Associates; (2003) Local performance indicators for the arts library of local performance indicators, , http://www.local-pi-library.gov.uk/PI_arts.pdf, March), Audit Commission/Improvement and Development Agency.

From the mid-1980s Sheffield's museums suffered regular annual cuts, a reflection of the City Council's general financial problems. In 1994 the Museums Department and the Arts Department were integrated under a Leisure Directorate, and Kelham Island Industrial Museum was transferred to an independent charitable trust with grant aid from the City Council, in partnership with Sheffield Hallam University and the Company of Cutlers in Hallamshire. In April 1998 the City Council created the Sheffield Galleries and Museums Trust to manage four existing museums and art galleries and the new Millennium Gallery (opening 2000). The latter was part of a £20 million 'Heart of the City' project and the new Trust was also supported by an Arts Council of England Stabilisation Award of £1.15 million. Revenue funding has been secured for six years with a legal agreement that binds the City to provide an annual grant based on 1997/98 core budget, with a review in the third year to respond to inflation.The City is obliged to provide 'reasonable' funding to sustain the new organisation for a further four years (Middleton, 1998: 24-5).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Anderson, D., (1997) A Common Wealth.

Prior to this the industry received financial support from the Office of Arts and Libraries (OAL). The 1995 annual report of the DNH outlines the department's medium-term objectives in relation to film, which are to: (a) establish a framework that will allow the industry to thrive; (b) promote the UK as a location for the filming of feature films, television programmes and commercials; (c) expand opportunities for access to high- quality films from Britain and elsewhere; and (d) foster international cooperation in the production, distribution and exhibition of films.","(a) Provisional figures. (b) Jointly funded by the government and the film and television industry. £0.4 million of the government funding of the National Film and Television School is incentive funding towards finding matching contributions from Industry. (c) Total may differ from sum of parts due to rounding. (d) Using GDP deflator.","Office which provides funding under the National Heritage (Scotland) Act 1985 to the Scottish Film Council (SFC) and the Scottish Film Production Fund (SFPF). The SFC, which has the remit to promote all aspects of the moving image in Scotland, received £1.019 million from the Scottish Office in 1994/95. In April 1996, following the publication of a report, Scotland on Screen, commissioned from Hydra Associates, the Secretary of State for Scodand announced a package of measures to strengthen the government's support for the film and television industry in Scotland. These measures include the formation of a new body, the Scottish Screen Agency, which will absorb the functions of the SFC, the SFPF and two other film agencies. The new body will operate from 1997.","There is no direct government support for the film industry in Wales. However, Screen Wales is in receipt of public money from both the Welsh Development Agency and the Cardiff Bay Development Corporation, while the Wales Film Council receives a grant from the Arts Council of Wales (£229,750 in 1994/95). The Northern Ireland Film Council (NIFC) receives public funding from the Arts Council of Northern Ireland (ACNI) in the form of a revenue grant (£100,000 in 1994/95). It is anticipated that in 1997 the ACNI will devolve responsibility for the development of cultural film activity in Northern Ireland to the NIFC (which will then be directly funded by the Northern Ireland Office of Education).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"British Film Institute BFI Film and Television Handbook, , various years; British Video Association The BVA Yearbook, , various years; CAA Cinema Advertising, , various years UK Fact Sheet; (1994) Cultural Trends, 6 (3). , 1996 Issue 23,London: PSI; Department of National Heritage Annual Report, , various years; Fitzherbert, L., Giussani, C., Hunt, H., (1996) The National Lottery Yearbook, London: The Directory of Social Change; National Audit Office (1994) The British Film Institute, , London: HMSO; National Heritage Committee (1995) The British Film Industry, , London: HMSO",,,,,,,,,09548963,,,,"English","Cult.

The sole grant awarded in Wales was to the Dyfed County Council Museum Service. The Arts Councils made 24 grants to museums and galleries in 1995: 12 (50 per cent) went to English projects; 7 (29.2 per cent) to Scottish projects; 4 (16.7 per cent) to Welsh projects; and 1(4.2 per cent) went to Northern Ireland. The total value of grants awarded was £6.5 million, much less than that awarded to museums and galleries by either the Millennium Fund or the HLF. Projects in England received 94.6 per cent of the total value of grants, Scotland 4.2 per cent, Wales 1 per cent and Northern Ireland 0.2 per cent. In England, 50 per cent of the successful applications and 71.8 per cent of the total value of grants went to the West Midlands. This was due to the Ikon Gallery receiving the largest grant by far in the whole of the UK - £3.7million. The smallest grant was £8,000 to the Fruitmarket Gallery in Edinburgh. However, these twogrants arenotreally relevant to this discussion because they were for galleries without permanent displays. In Scotland, six of the seven grants went to Edinburgh and Glasgow: they received three grants apiece. Of the total value of grants going to Scotland, Glasgow received £186,622 or 68.5per cent. Most of this (84per cent of the total grants to Glasgow) went to the Glasgow Museums service.","The MGIF was set up in 1991/92 and operated until the end of 1995/96. The Fund was supported by government funding from the DNH, SOED/SOEID, WO and DENI, matched by funding from the Wolfson Foundation and the Wolfson Family Charitable Trust. It was worth around £4 million a year, altogether providing £20 million for","spent on grants and other activities, and 16.5 per cent on staff and other costs. A large proportion of the latter comprises staff and overhead costs incurred in providing advisory services to museums. Although the precise percentage of the MGC's spend on grants and other activities has varied between 1989/90 and 1994/95, it was at its highest in 1989/90. The Conservation Unit is an integral part of the MGC's operations.

In June 1992, new higher education funding councils were set up in England, Scotland and Wales under the Further and Higher Education Act 1992 and the Further and Higher Education (Scotland) Act 1992. The Act removed the distinction between universities, polytechnics and colleges of higher education in these countries. The funding councils took responsibility for the funding of all higher education institutions (HEIs) in April 1993. Responsibility for the funding of HEIs in Northern Ireland was passed from the UFC and PCFC to DENI, which is advised by the Northern Ireland Higher Education Council. Figures for non-formula funding of university collections by the UFC are no longer available, but the paragraphs below summarise non- formula expenditure by the new funding councils since they began operations in 1993/94.","4 The Geffrye and Horniman museums were originally funded by the Greater London Council, which was abolished in 1986. Then funding responsibility passed to the ILEA until 1990 when it too was abolished. The MGC took over responsibility for two years: following a quinquennial review of the MGC it was decided that the DNH should fund the two museums directly with effect from April 1992. During the two years that the MGC was responsible for funding the Geffrye and Horniman museums, the DNH supplemented its basic grant-in-aid with supplemental grants for each museum.",,,,,,,,,,,,"Annual Accounts of individual museums and galleries; HMSO Appropriation Accounts; Bicknell, S., Farmelo, G., (1993) Museum Visitor Studies in the 90s, , London: Science Museum; Bordieu, P., Darbel, A., (1991) The Love of Art: European Art Museums and their Public, , Cambridge: Polity Press; Council of Museums in Wales Annual Reports; (1993) Cultural Trends, 5 (3). , Issue 19 London: PSI; Department of National Heritage Annual Reports; (1996) Department of National Heritage, , People Taking Part, London: DNH; (1996) Department of National Heritage, , Treasures in Trust a Review of Museum Policy, London: DNH; Fitzherbert, L., Giussani, C., Hurd, H., (1996) The National Lottery Yearbook, , 1996 edition, London: Directory of Social Change; Foundation for Sport and the Arts Annual Reports; Merriman, N., Bgond the Glass Case, Leicester: Leicester University Press; Miles, R.S., (1988) The Design of Educational Exhibits, , London: Unwin Hyman; Ministry of Defence Annual Reports; Museums & Galleries Commission Reports; (1994) Museums and Galleries Commission, , Towards a government policy for museums: the MGCs policy statement and the MGCs response to the DNHpolicy review, London: MGC; (1992) National Audit Office, , Department of National Heritage, National Museums and Galleries: Quality of Service to the Public.

Higher Education Funding Council for England","Chapter 5 examines employment in the cultural sector. In recent years, the cultural sector has been promoted not only for its intrinsic contribution to national life but also for its extrinsic contribution as a source of economic regeneration and as a creator of jobs. This chapter makes clear that the sector is an important source of jobs in the economy. It shows that the jobs in question are very heterogeneous, that some are highly paid and some lowly paid, that some are rather precarious and unemployment is not infrequent, even if there are also many people who have worked for a single organisation for a long time. Many people in the sector work for themselves or are self-employed and in certain sub-sectors, volunteers are important providers of labour. Cultural Trends is completely independent: it offers a compilation and unbiased assessment of material from both published and unpublished sources. It relies on the goodwill and cooperation of many organisations and individuals in the sectors concerned. They provide many of the figures, offer information and advice - but the conclusions are, unless otherwise stated, the authors' own.

Of the rest, more than half work in academic libraries and therefore work in the education sector. The remainder work in industry, commerce and a range of other libraries serving the needs of their parent organisations.

It also provides grants to the seven English area museum councils, which in turn offer limited grant assistance, advice and advocacy to the museums within their regions.9The area museum councils are membership organisations, generating further income from museums, local authorities, universities and other institutions in their areas. They perform an important strategic role within their respective regions, contributing to policy formation at national level and advising the Museums & Galleries Commission on regional issues. However, the funds they distribute are relatively small (most funding being distributed by the Museums & Galleries Commission itself) and for this reason they are not analysed separately within this section.","Museums & Galleries Commission's regional funding is its grants to the area museum councils. In 1995/96, these accounted for £4.1 million, approximately 70 per cent of the Museums & Galleries Commission's regionally divisible expenditure. The Museums & Galleries Commission also operates a number of grant schemes through which financial assistance is channelled directly to museums and galleries. These schemes include purchase grants and capital grants. The Museums & Galleries Commission does not, as a rule, distribute revenue funding. However, it provides a grant of approximately £1 million to the Tyne & Wear Museums Service, which has 15 museums and galleries. The subsidy has been provided since the abolition of the metropolitan county council in 1986 to help the Tyne & Wear districts provide a county-wide museums service. The subsidy, which has now run for ten years, is currently under review. Purchase grants are awarded to museums wishing to add to their collections. There are two types of purchase grant, both administered on behalf of the Museums & Galleries Commission by national museums. The Museums & Galleries Commission/V&A Purchase Grant Fund, as its title suggests, is administered by the Victoria & Albert Museum. It is intended to assist museums and galleries acquire objects relating to the fine arts, history and literature. The Fund for the Preservation of Industrial and Scientific Material is administered by the Science Museum and is used to help museums acquire and conserve items relating to science and technology. A total of £1.3 million was awarded through the purchase grant schemes in 1995/96, approximately 20 per cent of the total grant expenditure analysed in this section.","In the financial year 1995/96the Heritage Lottery Fund made 302 grant awards, of which 60 were awarded to museums and galleries in England. These represented a total allocation of £113 million, and were for a range of activities which included acquisitions, refurbishment and construction work. Table 1.13 provides a breakdown of these grants by area museum council region. The figures show that theSouth Eastern Museums Service region, being home to a number of national museums supported bytheHeritage","5. Lottery funding is awarded to the sector studied in this chapter by the Heritage Lottery Fund and the Arts Council of England, whose decisions are guided by policy issued by the Sectretary of State for National Heritage in 1994. Reserved for capital projects, Lottery funding has made a considerable contribution to the nation's cultural infrastructure.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"The approach follows that adopted by Hutchison (1982), to analyse the then Arts Council of Great Britain's expenditure on its national clients; The first regional arts board (in the South West) had been created in response to the closure of the Council’s regional offices It was funded by local authorities and independent sources. The last to be set up was South East Arts; Reflecting on the fact that regionally funded art provision tended to be much closer to the grass roots, Lord Goodman, then Chair of the Arts Council, made clear to the House of Lords (1972) We are concerned with the Arts, , The business about amateur theatricals, the crafts and the like is something about which one needs to be very sceptical indeed’; This followed the abolition of the Greater London Council (1986) anticipation of the discussions about a future government for London, , in and was in (see London Borough Grants Committee, 1996); Lottery funding is awarded to the sector studied in this chapter by the Heritage Lottery Fund and the Arts Council of England, whose decisions are guided by policy issued by the Sectretary of State for National Heritage (1994) Reserved for capital projects, Lottery funding has made a considerable contribution to the nation’s cultural infrastructure; The Arts Council of England can only distribute Lottery funds as revenue support of endowments where the costs are associated with a Lottery-funded capital project, or where the lack of financial assistance means that the project would not otherwise be completed (1995) the Arts Council of England did not award any endowment or revenue grants, , 96; In defence of its decisions, The Arts Council of England has pointed out that these four flagship organisations received their awards early in the Lottery’s history not because of favouratism but because they submitted their bids promptly The sheer size of the organisations and the amount of resources they were able to dedicate to their bids no doubt facilitated the timeliness of their applications, , The Arts Council of England has also observed (see Fitzherbert et al., 1995) that even if it had wished to fund similar large-scale projects based in the regions, it was not able to do so during the first round of Lottery awards since no bids of a similar scale had been forthcoming; (1997) Further developments have taken place since this chapter was written, , April, the Institute published its Corporate Plan 1997/98-2000/01 which details the creation of a Regional Development Unit with the objective of promoting a diverse and accessible moving image culture across the UK in collaboration with local, regional and national agencies. The Institute states: This work represents one of the main expressions of the British Film Institute’s commitment to truly national provision and the equalisation of provision across the UK’. The Regional Development Unit has replaced the Cinema Services and Development Division which was previously responsible for regional funding distribution. The Corporate Plan also announces the British Film Institute’s intention of launching a television channel, the BFI Channel, which will aim to extend access to a range of films which would not otherwise be easily available to UK audiences. The material will include historic British programming as well as films being screened at the National Film Theatre; The Department of National Heritage’s review of museums policy (1996) Treasures in Trust, , Proposed that the government, in close collaboration with the Museums & Galleries Commission should ‘examine a range of options for the future of the Area Museum Councils in England; Wilding, R., This chapter draws on the annual reports and accounts for all the funding bodies discussed, in addition to various Arts Council policy documents including The so-called Wilding Report (1989) Supporting the Arts: A review of the structure of arts funding Presented to the Minister for the Arts, and various National Arts & Media Strategy documents, , (1991—1993); ABSA (1995) Annual Report 1994/95, , Annual Report 1994/95.

It is, of course, possible for heritage projects to obtain funding from a wider range of European Union programmes than this (for example, research and development) if they fulfil the programme criteria.","The SPAB was founded in 1887. It is the oldest of the National Amenity Societies, predating even the National Trust. At 31 December 1994, the SPAB had 6,377 members. At the time of writing, accounts for the financial year were not available, so the figures given here refer to 1993/94. The total income of the SPAB that year was £313,596. Thirty-five per cent of its total income (£109,873) came from courses and events, rental income and other sources such as bank interest. Contributions, donations and subscriptions amounted to 28 per cent (£86,573). Grants from the DOE, the Welsh Office and the J Mason Trust accounted for 17 per cent of its income. Life memberships provided less than 5 per cent. The SPAB's expenditure was £339,467. Its operational deficit of £25,871 was covered by the society's accumulated fund.","The CBA was founded in 1943 in response to devastation caused by war. The CBA is concerned with archaeological sites, and its key activities comprise research, conservation, education, information and publication. The total income of the CBA in 1994/95 was £474,485. Core funding for the CBA comes from the British Academy. In addition to the DNH grant, the CBA also received funds from Cadw for casework, and from EH towards the production of archaeological publications and the Young Archaeologists Club. These and other, smaller grants made accounted for over 70 per cent of its income. Subscriptions from the Council's 410 member societies and organisations generated about 10 per cent of its income, and affiliation fees less than 5 per cent. The Council earned £79,356 - 17 per cent of income - from sales of and subscriptions to publications, insurance commission, advertising revenue, and agency work. Investments rendered up less than 1 per cent. The CBA's expenditure was £473,567.","The DOE(NI)'s grants for the conservation of the built heritage in 1994/95 are given in Table 2.9. The amount distributed represents about 5 per cent of EH's giving. It made grants under five headings: to the National Trust; matching funding for the European Commission's Tourism Sub-Programme; churches; district councils; and to private individuals for their properties. Over half its grant funding went to properties in private hands. By comparison, district councils received about 6 per cent, and churches less.","As part of its support for the urban programme, the DOE sponsors English Partnerships, the urban regeneration agency, which promotes job creation, inward investment and environmental improvement, through the reclamation and development of vacant, derelict or contaminated land. English Partnerships became operational in April 1994, when it assumed responsibility for the former Derelict Land Grant and City Grant programmes, and the Direct Development programmes. The latter had been the responsibility of English Estates and were funded by the Department of Trade and Industry. The Derelict Land Grant encouraged local authorities, the private sector and voluntary bodies to carry out environmental improvement projects, while the City Grant encouraged private sector investment in projects to improve run-down urban areas.","(e) Sum sreceivedfromotheragencies.Th9seotheragenciesincludeEnglishHeritage, Department oftheEnvironment, European Regional Development Funds, the Rural Development Commission, Housing Corporation, etc.","Grants are a major source of income for the NTS.

Endowment grants were worth just over £8 million, while grants for capital projects accounted for just over £3 million and revenue grants £0.3 million.","AHF's feasibility grants programme is funded through the Heritage Grants Fund. By the end of 1994/95, the AHF had disbursed £146,368 in grants for 70 studies.",,,,,,,,,,,,"The difficulties of defining ‘the built heritage’ can be illustrated by considering the interests of different bodies which support the sector The National Heritage Memorial Fund, one of the major funding bodies for heritage in the UK, for example, allocates grants according to five categories of heritage: ancient monuments, , historic buildings and sites; land of scenic, scientific or historic importance; printed books, manuscripts, archives and other records; museum and gallery collections; and industrial and maritime heritage. Its first category largely corresponds with the Department of National Heritage’s (DNH’s) working definition of the built heritage. However, the DNH embraces elements of the environment that have legal protection, and includes registered gardens and conservation areas. It also supports Royal Parks and historic wrecks; English Heritage (EH) is primarily concerned with the conservation of the ‘historic environment’ including the provision of advice to the DNH on the listing of buildings, scheduling of ancient monuments, and registration of conservation areas, , EH also keeps non-statutory registers of historic parks, gardens and battlegrounds. Historic Scotland (HS), an executive agency of the Scottish Office charged with the protection, conservation and presentation of Scotland’s built heritage, describes the built heritage as including ‘ancient monuments and archaeological sites; historic, buildings; parks and gardens, and designed landscapes’. Cadw, the executive agency of the Welsh Office responsible for preservation and conservation of the built heritage in Wales, is concerned with historic buildings and ancient monuments and is currently producing a register of parks and gardens; (1996) Department of National Heritage press release, DNH 145/96, , 15 May; Unfortunately, at the time of writing, the other National Amenity Societies were unable or unwilling to give details of their accounts for the time period covered here, or for the previous financial year, , Therefore it is not possible to include details of their income and expenditure here; (1994) Of the 57 trusts which provided usable information, 11 could only give figures for the financial year 1994/95 or the calendar year, , Many of the trusts which provided figures for the financial year 1994/95 had different year-ends. Despite these caveats, all 57 replies have been used in the calculation of charitable expenditure on the built heritage. Only one trust failed to provide a breakdown of its charitable giving. Consequently its contribution to the built heritage could not be disaggregated from its contribution to the ‘environment’. Not all schedules of donations were complete: one trust, for example, only included details of major grants. In four cases it was unclear whether the donations listed were paid in the period, or merely approved. In three cases, trusts which themselves made grants were in receipt of charitable donations from other trusts. In order to avoid double counting, the latter were deducted. Given these difficulties, it must be emphasised that figures being discussed here are not an accurate estimation of the input of charitable trusts into the built heritage sector, but should be viewed more as a minimum level of such input; Unfortunately, three trusts supplied details of their spending on the built heritage sector, but did not include their total charitable giving, , Of this figure, £7.6 million appears to have gone to the built heritage. The reason the word ‘appears’ is used is because the purpose of the grant was not always given, so it was not always clear exactly what the money was to be used for. For example, money going to individual churches may not always have been used for repairing the fabric of the buildings, but for furnishings.

These figures only cover the MGC's basic grant from the DNH, and exclude the additional funding required for theGeffrye andHorniman museums. Thesetwo museums were funded by the Greater London Council until it was abolished in 1986. Control then passed to the ILEA until April 1990 when it too ceased to exist, after which it passed to the London Residuary Body.

The national museums involved9 are the British Museum, the Natural History Museum, the Imperial War Museum, the National Gallery, the National Maritime Museum, the National Museums and Galleries on Merseyside, the National Portrait Gallery, the Science Museum, the Tate Gallery, the Victoria and Albert Museum and the Wallace Collection. The non-national museums funded directly by the DNH are the Manchester Museum of Science and Industry, the Sir John Soane's Museum, the Museum of London and from 1992/3, the Geffrye Museum and the Horniman Museum.","Area Museum Councils Museum Documentation Association Capital grants Post-abolition revenue grants to museums: Tyne and Wear Museum Service Transitional grants Geffrye Museum Horniman Museum Miscellaneous Purchase Grant funds The Conservation Unit Travelling exhibitions Other","is more than simply a conduit for passing on government museum funding to secondary distribution agencies. The third activity heading referred to earlier, covers the MGC's expenditure on a range of other supported programmes and direct activities. While these may not involve a great deal of money in absolute terms, they are of enormous importance to the museum community on whose behalf they are undertaken. These programmes include the Museum Documentation Association, the Capital Grants Fund, the Purchase Grant funds and the Conservation Unit. The MGC decided to close its Travelling Exhibitions grant scheme at the end of 1992/3 for purely financial reasons. However it is sustaining a publication which lists travelling exhibitions, and it is also preparing a standards document concerning this activity.","restoration of the 1830 warehouse at the Manchester Museum of Science and Industry at a cost of £2.1 million, with financial support from the Central Manchester Development Corporation, English Heritage and the DNH,","For this reason, DNH expenditure on the Royal Armouries is not included in table 1.1 and the subsequent tables which derive from it: details are shown separately in table 1.22. Government financial support for the Royal Armouries increased slowly during the period when it was funded by the DOE, rising to £3.8 million in 1991/2. The grant aid was increased to £5.4 million during the first year of funding by the DNH, after which it is scheduled to fall back to its DOE level of £3.8 million in 1993/4.","The Northern England report identifies five collections which have been designated under the non-formula system for funding by the HEFCE which replaced Special Factor funding: this has offered some measure of financial security even though the sums involved may be relatively small. Further, the designation of collections as eligible for non-formula funding has occasionally been helpful in attracting capital project funding from outside sources. University collections may also be eligible for grants from non-university sources, such as the MGIF and the MGC Purchase Grant Fund (PRISM) and Capital Grants scheme.","Grants (number) Grants (£ thousands) Average grant (£ thousands) Percentage of total Fund expenditure","Grants (number) Grants (£ thousands) Average grant (£ thousands) Total purchase price of items (£ thousands) Percentage of purchase price represented by NACF grants","MGC purchase grant funds","When it first became apparent that a national lottery might well be set up, members of the Football Pools Promoters' Association sought to establish their own Foundation for Sport and the Arts (FSA) in an attempt to pre-empt the national scheme. Permission was granted by the government in March 1991, on the basis of a government decision to reduce pools betting duty by 2.5 per cent for 4 years. The Foundation for Sport and the Arts is an independent discretionary trust. It is privately funded by weekly subscriptions from the three football pools companies Littlewoods, Vernons and Zetters, at a rate averaging approximately £1.2 million per week. This agreement has created a fund worth approximately £60 million per annum to assist sport and the arts: the sum allocated to the arts is £20 million. The FSA is open to applications for awards from appropriate organisations throughout the UK.","(a) the Royal Armouries, which is also funded by the Department of National Heritage, but from its Heritage budget, and","(b) the two armed services museums - the National Army Museum and the Royal Air Force Museum - both of which are funded by the Ministry of Defence.","The report was commissioned in December 1991 by the Museum Training Institute, supported by the funding from the Department of Employment.

The presentation of the income from such sources varies accordingly, , Further, many museums also hold trust funds, analogous to ‘restricted funds’ held by charities, which may receive sponsorship funds and donations. The usual practice is for these funds to reimburse the museums’ grant-in-aid funds only when expenditure is incurred on projects they were set up to support, which may be some years after monies were received. It is intended that consolidated accounts will be produced for 1993/4, and that these will include all trading companies and trust funds controlled by museum trustees. However they will still not include separate charities such as Friends organisations which have independent boards of trustees; (1993) See report in The Times, , 16 October; For the pattern of government funding of the performing arts, see Cultural Trends 1993 (1993) Policy Studies Institute, 18 (5). , July; Frequent reference is made in the text and accompanying tables to long-term features in the funding of museums and galleries by the Department of National Heritage It should be remembered that the Department of National Heritage only came into existence from the beginning of the 1992/3 financial year, , Prior to that, central government responsibility for museums and galleries was largely exercised through the Office of Arts and Libraries, and occasionally in certain special cases through other government departments; In fact some of these increases are the result of special factors rather than arising from any underlying trend, , For example a major element of the substantial increases in recent years in grant-aid to the National Gallery is directly attributable to the additional running costs of the Gallery's new Sainsbury Wing. Detailed grant-aid to individual museums is covered in table 1.7; Many of the tables in this chapter show data back to 1985/6 However this is not an appropriate base year to use for any trend analysis because of the distortions caused by transitional funding arising out of the abolition of the Greater London Council and the metropolitan counties and the consequent transfer of funding responsibilities for certain museums and galleries to the Office of Arts and Libraries, , Most comparisons are therefore made between the latest figures and 1986/7 rather than 1985/6; There is no statutory definition of a national museum (1992) even though the 11 museums are officially designated as such. In 1988 the Museums & Galleries Commission set out four important characteristics which all the national museums had in common, and which clearly distinguished them from the non-national collections, , These are discussed in detail in The National Museums, MGC, 1988 and are summarised in Cultural Trends 1992, issue 14, Vol. 4, No. 2, Policy Studies Institute, July; The AMCs provide project grants for museums, but not revenue funding; This list covers 11 of the 14 national museums in England which are funded from the Museums and Galleries expenditure programme of the Department of National Heritage, , The other three are: (a) the Royal Armouries, which is also funded by the Department of National Heritage, but from its Heritage budget, and (b) the two armed services museums — the National Army Museum and the Royal Air Force Museum — both of which are funded by the Ministry of Defence; The grant figures disclosed on the face of the published accounts of the museums do not necessarily correspond to the three-way division, , The portion of the Running Costs and Building Fund grants attributable to revenue projects appear in the Income and Expenditure; Account, while the portion of the grant used for capital expenditure on equipment and improvements to buildings and permanent exhibitions is credited to a Deferred Government Grant Account, which is then released in annual installments over the life of the asset in accordance with standard depreciation practice, , The treatment of the government portion of grants from the MGIF is not consistent between museums. Some disclose this under a heading of Deferred Government Grant, while others include in in a separate reserve fund. The purchase grant is taken into a separate Collection Purchase Fund, which also includes grants from the NHMF, NACF etc. The cost of any acquisitions is transferred from this fund to income and expenditure; Cultural Trends 1992 (1992) Policy Studies Institute, 14 (4). , July; This refers to the abolition of the Greater London Council and the Metropolitan County Councils in 1986 ; Expenditure on NIMAC by the MGC is included in the latter's accounts within the totals for staff and other operational costs, and appears there within table 1.9; Museum Sector Workforce Survey: an analysis of the workforce in the museums (1993) galleries and heritage sector in the United Kingdom, , April; The report was commissioned in December 1991 by the Museum Training Institute supported by the funding from the Department of Employment.

In these years, and again in 1989/90 (80 per cent response rate) CIPFA provided summary estimates of the grossed-up expenditure, based on populations in the returning and non-returning authorities, , CIPFA did not attempt to gross-up the figures in 1990/1, when the response rate fell to 72 per cent, although it was still possible to perform the calculations based on population figures. However in 1991/2 when the response rate was still only 75 per cent (339 responding authorities out of 450) summaries were once again presented in a grossed-up form, accompanied by the warning, in CIPFA's own words, that ‘care should be exercised when undertaking year-on-year comparisons as the Institute's confidence in the “grossed-up” results is less than might otherwise be expected’. The response rate in 1992/3 was again 75 per cent; (1993) Museums & Galleries Commission, , Press Release, 8 September; See: Cultural Trends 1993 (1993) Policy Studies Institute, , Export of Works of Art 1990/91.

Unauthorised sound recording sales had a retail value of £1.4 billion. The IFPI believe that these figures significantly understate the magnitude of the problem, because of the incomplete international coverage of the statistics; The position of composers and other musicians in this respect contrasts with that of authors and writers of books Until relatively recently the latter received royalty payments only on first-time sales of copies of their books: no recognition was made of their rights to receive payment when their books were borrowed from a public library until the introduction of the Public Lending Right scheme in the early 1980s, , Under this scheme registered authors became entitled to a share of a government fund (currently £4.75 million annually) based on loans of their books from public libraries. For a full review of statistics relating to the Public Lending Right scheme, see Cultural Trends, issue 10 (1991) and issue 16 (1992), Policy Studies Institute; The PRS is the oldest collecting society in the UK, but not the oldest in the world They were known in Europe as early as the middle years of the 19th century; Performing Right' is technically defined as the right to perform a work in public or to broadcast it or include it in a cable programme service; The main implementation phase of the Performing Right On-Line Membership Services (PROMS) project commenced during 1990 Repeated delays in implementation of the system during 1992 ultimately led to a decision to write of as an exceptional item of £4 million all those systems which were not in use in the business, , Total stated costs for the year include this write-off; By way of comparison, in 1991/2 the administrative cost of running PLR - the comparable system for recompensing authors for the library use of their books - amounted to 16.9 per cent of revenue including an allowance towards computer replacement costs. However it must be remembered that whereas the PLR scheme receives its income by means of a simple pre-determined government grant, , a large proportion of PRS administration is accounted for by enforcing and collecting licence revenues from a large number of sources within the UK and overseas; For fuller PLR statistics see Cultural Trends 1992 Policy Studies Institute, 16 (4); See Cultural Trends 1993 Policy Studies Institute, 17 (5); This dispute has since been settled; See for example Cultural Trends issue 17 on the how little the British film industry has benefitted from the resurgence in cinemagoing",,,,,,,,,09548963,,,,"English","Cult.

However although the DNH is the only source of funding for the ACGB, the ACGB is not the only source of funding for the RABs. In addition to their grants direct from the ACGB, all the RABs also receive grants from the British Film Institute and from the Crafts Council. They also receive financial support from local authorities in their area, in the form of subscriptions: with one exception, this amounts to between 5 and 12 per cent of total income. In addition they derive small but significant amounts of income from the private sector in terms of sponsorships, contributions and membership subscriptions. However to put these figures in context, the grant from the ACGB typically accounts for 80 per cent or more of the total income of the RABs from all sources.","Grant from the Arts Council of Great Britain 12.956 Other income, net(b) 0.121 Total 13.077","Grant from the Arts Council of Great Britain Grant from Crafts Council Grant from British Film Institute Other income, net(a) Total","(c) Excluding supplementary grant of £0.842 million from the Arts Council of Great Britain to the Welsh Arts Council for","Revenue grants Programme and project grants Joint funding schemes Other schemes(a) Staff and administration Total","Government Support grant(a) Special capital grant(b) Special revenue grants(c) Research grant Special initiative grant Community Arts Outreach Programme Cultural Traditions funding(d) Association for Business Sponsorship of the Arts(e) - Accrued and sundry income Total","Although the grant income is shown as a single figure, in fact the total sum comprises a grant from the DNH for the scheme in England, Wales and Scotland, plus a separate grant from the Department of Education, Northern Ireland (DENI) for a separately funded scheme in Northern Ireland.

It involved a fully national survey based on an audience/visitor self-completion questionnaire distributed during March and April 1993 at each of approximately 170 venues. It yielded 8,140 respondents. Participating venues returned on average about 100 questionnaires each, covering 90 events across the full range of artforms. Not all venues provided details of whether or not they were sponsored. Additionally, the research was intended to provide a profile at a given point in time, of a cross-section of audiences to sponsored arts events in the UK, in demographic and other terms. The results of this element of the survey are largely beyond the remit of this report; Questionnaires were sent to all 650 MPs the election Only 93 were returned, representing a response rate of 14 per cent.

However, from 1993/4 the system of three separate grants is being abolished. Instead, the national museums are being given a single grant-in-aid, and will not need to seek permission from the DNH before reallocating funds from one category of expenditure to another within any given year, as they were required to do in the past; (1987) Theatres Trust, Tenth Annual Report, , July; (1992) Towards a National Arts and Media Strategy, , Arts Council; The Theatres Trust was established by Act of Parliament in 1976 to ‘promote the better protection of theatres for the benefit of the nation’",,,,,,,,,09548963,,,,"English","Cult.

The report was based on the results of interviews with a sample of 1,298 actual and potential attenders of the live arts spilt equally between Edinburgh, Birmingham, Manchester and Liverpool; A new set of box office categories was introduced from the beginning of 1989, to correspond with the categories used in SWET's other audience research programme. Results for 1988 and 1987 were re-stated using these new categories, to give a basis for some historical comparisons, but the analyses for earlier years were no longer comparable; Gross box office takings by SWET members are stated inclusive of VAT. (1991), As a result of the march 1991 Budget, the rate of VAT was increased from 15 to 17.5 per cent from 1 April that year. Since ticket prices are sold inclusive of VAT, this had the effect of reducing gross revenues by over 2 per cent on each ticket sold.

Native Arts and Cultures Foundation, NACF","There are also a number of other government departments which provide direct central government funding on a smaller scale for certain more specialised national and other museums. The Ministry of Defence is responsible for the provision of funding for certain national and non-national armed services museums which are not funded by the OAL. The Department of the Environment (DOE) has been responsible for the Royal Armouries at the Tower of London (although this responsibility has now passed to the new DNH, along with other related DOE responsibilities). The Department of Education and Science, through the Universities Funding Council, is responsible for providing financial support to a number of university museums (none of which have national status).","Table 6 provides a detailed analysis of the direct funding made available by the OAL to the 11 individual national and 3 non-national museums comprising the totals in the first two lines of figures in table 5. It emphasises the fact that being a national museum has little to do with size. In terms of annual grants in 1991/2, the national museums funded by the OAL range from the British Museum (total grant-in-aid £31.344 million) to the Wallace Collection (£1.897 million): this latter museum actually received a smaller grant from the OAL than the non-national Museum of London.","Even the considerable level of central government funding shown for the Museum of London belies its actual size: the OAL grant represents slightly less than one half its total grant income. Under the terms of theMuseum ofLondon Act 1986,the Corporation of London has a statutory obligation to match the OAL grant, and the museum also receives financial assistance from the Historic Buildings and Monuments Commission (HBMC)4.","The Geffrye and Horniman museums have an unusually chequered funding history. They were originally funded by the Greater London Council. When this body was abolished in 1986, control passed temporarily to the ILEA. On the demise of the ILEA in April 1990, responsibility passed to the London Residuary Body for a short transitional period. From there, control was temporarily assumed by the MGC pending the establishment of new Boards of Trustees for the two museums. This arrangement lasted until April 1992, when funding responsibility passed to the OAL/DNH.","(iv) raising standards in museums by operating effective grant schemes and by highly selective revenue funding.","Area Museum Councils Museum Documentation Association Capital grants Post-abolition revenue grants to museums: Tyne and Wear Museum Service Transitional grants Geffrye Museum Horniman Museum Miscellaneous Purchase Grant funds The Conservation Unit Travelling exhibitions Other","At the present time there is no corresponding Museums Council for Northern Ireland, which has been a source of some concern. The Northern Ireland Museums Advisory Committee (NIMAC) was established in January 1990 as a three year pilot project, acting as an embryo AMC for Northern Ireland while working towards the goal of establishing a fully fledged body. NIMAC is financially supported by the MGC, the Northern Ireland Department of Education and museums in the Province.","scenic, historic, aesthetic, architectural or scientific interest, having regard to the desirability of securing public access or display. The NHMF has been jointly financed by annual grants from the DOE and the OAL,each of which contributed £1.5 million per annum for a number of years up to and including 1990/1. Thereafter the total government grant to the NHMF quadrupled, providing a total sum of £12 million per annum from 1991/2, of which the OAL contribution amounted to £5.5 million. Substantial further income arises from interest received on investments made possible by the operation of a capital reserve or endowment fund of some £17 million, which enables the NHMF to make annual awards considerably in excess of its direct grant income.","Grants (number) Grants (£ thousands) Average grant (£ thousands) Percentage of total Fund expenditure","Grants (number) Grants (E thousands) Average grant (£thousands) Total purchase price of items (£ thousands) Percentage of purchase price represented by NACF grants",,,,,,,,,,"(1991) Report on the Development of Petformance Indicators for the National Museums and Galleries, , Office of Arts and Libraries, February; (1991) Business Plan, , Museum Training Institute, June; (1992) The Museums and Galleries Commission, A Policy and Financial Management Review, , Report by Richard Wilding CB, January; (1991) Area Museum Councils: Museums Working Together, , Committee of Area Museum Councils; (1991) Export ofWorks ofArt 1990/91.

Direct comparisons between pre-and post-1986/7 spending levels in England are not at all easy to make. The consequences of abolition continue to influence the comparability of annual spending figures. The Geffrye and Homiman museums, funded by the GLC until 1986, were transferred to the Inner London Education Authority on abolition. When the ILEA was itself abolished in 1990, the Geffrye and Horniman museums became independent charitable trusts, funded by the Museums and Galleries Commission.","revenue expenditure on the arts, museums and galleries by the four main funding departments. Total revenue expenditure on museums and the arts by the four main departments was £298 million. (The figure of £298 million excludes the Natural History Museum, which, as noted, ought to be excluded to allow a more realistic comparison with previous years. If OAL revenue expenditure on the Natural History Museum is added in museum expenditure becomes £134 million and total revenue expenditure on the arts and museums becomes £314 million, 1989/90). For the national museums funded by the OAL and the SOED, the capital element has been taken to include all expenditure on buildings and maintenance. The largest increase in revenue expenditure on arts support has been in Northern Ireland; Department of Education (NI) expenditure in this area - largely made up of the annual grant to the Arts Council Northern Ireland - increased by 21 per cent in real terms between 1986/7 and 1989/90.","(f) The sum of £676,348 was towards the refurbishment of the Grand Opera House.

The Welsh Arts Council is responsible for film and crafts activity and receives grants from the British Film Institute and Crafts Council for these purposes. The Scottish Arts Council makes small annual grants for film, but principal responsibility for film in Scotland rests with the Scottish Film Council. Funding for crafts in Scotland is shared between Scottish Enterprise and Highlands Enterprise (formerly the Scottish Development Agency and the Highlands and Islands Development Board).

Some subsidies were paid to film-makers from 1916 and the Royal Opera House Covent Garden received three payments in the 1930s. It was the second world war which provided the initial stimulus for support of the performed arts. The Council for the Encouragement of Music and the Arts (CEMA) had been formed in the early years of the war to bring music and theatre to war workers. Although originally funded by the Pilgrim Trust, four months after its creation it received matching funds from the Board of Education. Initial involvement included very considerable support for amateur organisations, but eventually support for the amateur was all but dropped. The success of CEMA in stimulating audiences allowed the Pilgrim Trust to withdraw its funding, leaving government as sole financer.","After the war, CEMA became the Arts Council of Great Britain. The Scottish and Welsh Arts Councils are technically committees of the Arts Council of Great Britain although they enjoy a high degree of autonomy. The Arts Council of Northern Ireland was conceived during the war as a Northern Ireland CEMA, although it was funded by the Northern Ireland Ministry of Education. It became the Arts Council of Northern Ireland in 1963.","National museums and galleries Property Services Agency museums expenditure(b) Scottish Museums Council Local museums purchase fund Capital grant, Burrell Gallery Total museums","encourage companies to seek additional funding from private sources - the Business Sponsorship Incentive Scheme (BSIS, not run through the Arts Councils but administered by the Association for Business Sponsorship of the Arts and funded","specia l grant from the Department of Education (Nl) as part of the Capital Programme for the Arts.","Direct revenue expenditure on the arts and museums in 1987/8 divides almost equally between the central government main arts funding departments (£290.9 million) and local authorities (£256.6 million).

As table 1.7 shows, expenditure on the arts and museums increased from £110.6 million to £361.7 million between 1978/9 and 1988/9. At constant prices (deflated by the GDP deflator), the growth in arts and museum revenue expenditure isimpressive, increasing by 48per cent overthe period. However, part of this increase up to 1987/8 does not represent an increased financial commitment to the arts and museums, but instead reflects changes in the structure of funding at central and local government levels. The removal of a tier of local government, with the abolition of the metropolitan counties and the Greater London Council (GLC), brought additional financial responsibilities on central government Much of the responsibility for arts and museums funding previously undertaken by the GLC and metropolitan counties was transferred either to the relevant centrally-funded agency (Arts Council, British Film Institute or Museums and Galleries Commission), centralgovernment direct (inthe caseof the 'newly created' nationalmuseums on Merseyside) or the remaining tier of local government in the metropolitan areas (the successor districts and boroughs). In 1988/9, responsibility for funding of the Natural History Museum was transferred from the Department of Education and Science to the OAL. This added £21.7 million to the budget of the OAL. Part of the increase in total expenditure by the OAL in 1988/9 was accounted for by higher levels of spending on the building and maintenance of the national museums.","a n equivalent special grant from the Department of Education (NT) as part of the Capital Programme","Local authority expenditure Any discussion of trends in local authority expenditure on the arts during the 1980s is complicated by the absence of comparable annual statistics in a number of key areas. Although it is possible to examine local authority expenditure on museums and galleries with confidence, statistics on support for the performed and visual arts through grants, premises and promotions are problematic. Museums and galleries are considered a discrete category of expenditure by the Department of the Environment (DoE), Scottish Office and Welsh Office for their annual survey of local government revenue and capital expenditure - expenditure on them has previously been taken into account in the formula used to determine the Rate Support Grant No equivalent category exists for other arts expenditure by local authorities - the performing arts are not recognised for Grant Related Expenditure Assessment and authorities received no support from the Rate Support Grant for this purpose.","BSIS grants (inclusive of administration) (£ millions) Grants awarded Average value of grants (£s) Average sponsorship generated per grant (£s)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,09548963,,,,"English","Cult.
