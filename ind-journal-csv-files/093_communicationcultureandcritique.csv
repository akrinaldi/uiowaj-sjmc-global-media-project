Modi is the first PM to address the country through his own radio show, actively use social media, as well as technologies such as the 3D hologram. This article examines the ways in which Modi's celebritized politics is strategically constructed and performed, honing in on Modi's utilization of media, technology, and popular culture. It interrogates the processes such as the personalization of his political image through social media, the use of film stars to cultivate affect and allure by association, in constructing brand Modi. © 2019 The Author(s).

While Cassils primarily conceptualized PISSED/Fountain as a queering of binary, essentialist understandings of gendered embodiment, I draw on performance, queer, and critical ethnic studies to illustrate that these pieces simultaneously challenge other kinds of oppositional embodiments, particularly health versus disease and citizen versus alien and/or terrorist; conceptualizations the state frequently deploys to surveil and control marginalized populations. PISSED/Fountain offer audiences a new strategy for both exposing and contesting state violence: these pieces can be read as a politically strategic disidentification with the state's classification of certain bodies and their excretions as ''deviant'' and ''toxic'' in order to purposefully ''terrorize'' the state's bio- and necropolitical aims. © 2019 The Author(s).

Through an analysis of archival materials and newspaper accounts related to the production of 11 itinerant movies filmed in the Midwestern United States in the 1920s, this article examines the relationship between the itinerant films and community newspapers. By supporting these productions, these newspapers used a relatively new communication technology as a way to solidify their civic position. They helped create an intensely local product featuring recognizable landmarks, businesses and people that offered readers a way to combat the loss of community and place in an increasingly networked society. © 2019 The Author(s).

Further, this article attempts to move us to the Global South by calling attention to media objects and the mediated lives that function through those objects, that have not received any place in media history. Nor are they recognized as a media object. The basic questions that this article raises are: (a) what happens to our understanding of media's development when we complicate the temporality (North Atlantic Western) through which we narrate the history of media, and (b) What happens to our understanding of what media is when 24/7 electrification is not taken as a norm in our recognition of a media or technology object. What other media objects and mediated lives might then become visible? © 2019 The Author 2019. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of International Communication Association.

Although these voices are being heard, there are limits on the types of TGD representation displayed in media. The current study interviewed 27 TGD individuals. These interviews exposed how participants view the rise of TGD media representation. The main themes that emerged were TGD awareness and TGD identity discovery and role modeling. Clearly, there is a disconnect between transnormativity in the media and transnormativity in reality. © 2019 The Author(s).

True to their bombastic style, they did so publicly, publishing a post where staff commented on how they were going to vote regarding the union and why. This article examines the ensuing discussion to understand how this group of culture workers perceived their labor, and the value they sought not just from collective bargaining, but from doing so publicly. Gawker's unionization was aimed not exclusively at Gawker, but spoke to a vision for the entire sector. Gawker staff were motivated to collective action by the precarity that besets digital media, while the publicness of the effort was aimed at their peer organizations. The public performance of unionism at Gawker may signal a shift in the discourse around collective bargaining among young creative workers as more digital outlets come to organize their workforce. © 2019 The Author(s).

His pronouncements are often not just the taking of an ideological position, but a moral one which borders on the theological, conceptualizing the entrenchment of inequality as a normative evil. It is a form of activism where he uses his platform to exhort his audience to fight back against large, impersonal forces that he portrays as taking advantage of them. This article analyzes the program's mentions of the institutional effects of these policies on individuals and the economy and how mainstream media sources have either amplified or ignored his claims.

The goal of this article, then, is to examine how MMXXL's sonic and visual structures create the resonance that then translates to pleasure and a more holistic kind of representation for female viewers. By exploring how this film deploys not only the visual cues of beautiful male bodies to create bodily responses in its largely female audience but also querying how the sound cues create sonic visibility, I aim to illustrate how MMXXL enables women viewers from a cross section of intersectional identities the opportunity to not only feel seen but also desired. © 2019 The Author.","Identity; Magic Mike XXL (MMXXL); Pleasure; Representation; Resonance",,,,,,,,"Althusser, L., (1971) Lenin and Philosophy and Other Essays, , New York: NYU Press; Ang, I., Feminist desire and female pleasure: On janice radway's reading the romance: Women, patriarchy and popular literature (chapel hill, nc and london, England: University of North Carolina press, 1984) (1988) Camera Obscura: Feminism, Culture, and Media Studies, 6 (1), pp. 179-190; Barthes, R., (1975) The Pleasure of the Text, , (R.

However, the franchise has been critiqued for the lack of racial diversity in its contestant pool. This article examines the racialized and gendered logics of representation that frame the casting of the first black Bachelorette Rachel Lindsay. This article discusses the industrial conditions of possibility at the ABC network that led to Lindsay's casting in 2017, which center on the cultivation of diversity in primetime programming. Yet the courting of a black female lead is done without a commitment to the specificities of targeting a black woman to be at the forefront of the competition to find love. This article details the construction of the African American female lead's romantic journey and audience response at the intersections of race, gender, and the cultural politics of desire. © 2019 The Author.","Dating; Gender; Race; Reality Television; Representation; Romance; The Bachelorette",,,,,,,,"Abdul-Jabbar, K., (2017) Kareem Abdul-Jabbar: My Journey from 'Bachelorette' Critic to Guest Star (Guest Column), , https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/kareem-abdul-jabbar-my-journey-bachelorettecritic-guest-star-guest-column-1006560, The Hollywood Reporter.

These comedies sought to build intimate connections with their imagined audiences by crossing boundaries - social, bodily, and physical - to produce comedies of discomfort. Drawing in part on Rebecca Wanzo's consideration of ""precarious-girl comedy"" (2016) I examine how two British television comedies intensified these intimate connections through the use of direct address, binding the audience tightly to the sexual and social misadventures of their twenty-something female protagonists. Michaela Coel's Chewing Gum (E4, 2015-2017) follows naïve and desperately horny black working-class Londoner Tracey in her quest for sexual experience, and Phoebe-Waller Bridges' Fleabag (BBC Three, 2016-) documents an unnamed upper-middle-class white woman's sharply misanthropic journey through grief. In both programmes direct address serves to intensify the embrace of bodily affect and intimate access to interiority found in the ""precarious-girl comedy"" (Wanzo, 2016), producing moments of comic and emotional repulsion. Each program uses direct address's blend of directness and distance to different ends, but both draw audiences at times uncomfortably close to the singular perspective of their protagonists, creating an intensely affective comic intimacy. © 2019 The Author.","Affect; Comedy; Direct Address; Gender; Precarity; Television",,,,,,,,"Ashby, J., Postfeminism in the British frame (2005) Cinema Journal, 44 (2), pp. 127-133. , https://www.jstor.org/stable/3661101; Benson-Allott, C., No such thing not yet: Questioning television's female gaze (2017) Film Quarterly, 71 (2), pp. 65-71; Birke, D., Warhol, R., (2017) Multimodal You: Playing with Direct Address in Contemporary Narrative Television, , In J.

As an episodic form of critical engagement, recaps provide new opportunities for emerging female writers and writers of color to comment upon television's representational challenges and successes. As women-targeted media gains new traction in the marketplace, recaps can not only be an important vehicle for needed commentary about undervalued content, but they also may serve as a marker of the value of these programs for a historically underserved audience. Featuring interviews with five recappers and two editors from major entertainment-focused publications including The AV Club, Vulture, Vox, Hello Beautiful, Go Fug Yourself and Buzzfeed, this article explores the recap as a distinct genre with feminist potential to elevate new voices, to disrupt traditional taste hierarchies, and to embrace pleasure as a measure of quality. © 2019 The Author.","Feminist Media Studies; Intersectional Feminism; Journalists; Media Industry Studies; Quality Television; Television Criticism; Television Studies; Women-Targeted Media",,,,,,,,"Adalian, J., (2018) Almost 500 Scripted Shows Aired in 2018, but We Still Haven't Hit Peak TV.

This multiple address highlights how the lauded qualities of cult texts are standard in feminine narratives that need to appeal to a large cross section of women. Cult discourse still depends on misogyny and masculinized distinction even when the mainstream mode seems to break down gendered fandom. Contradictions emerge because cult was traditionally defined against the mindless consuming of women. However, the cultish consumption patterns for FSOG are deliberately fostered by merchandising strategies. Thus, the same element that shows cult tendencies is used to denigrate the film as the antithesis of cult: women as consumers. © 2019 The Author.","American Psycho; cult; fandom; feminine media; Fifty Shades of Grey (FSOG); The Fall; women",,,,,,,,"Abad-Santos, A., (2017) Why Wonder Woman's Second-weekend Sales Are so Extraordinary-and Important: Wonder Woman's Second Weekend Was Better Than Those of Batman v Superman and Suicide Squad, , https://www.vox.com/culture/2017/6/12/15782354/wonder-woman-box-office-second-weekend(lastaccessedApril27,2019), Vox, June 12; Abrams, J.J., Burk, B., Kennedy, K., Abrams, J.J., (2015) Star Wars: Episode VII-The Force Awakens [Motion Picture], , USA: Lucasfilm; Al-Mahadin, S., Is christian a sadist?

Samuels's positionality as a black woman leveraging her essential oils storyline into building a brand for herself brings the franchise into new cultural terrain: ""the new momism."" Douglas and Michaels (2004) describe the new momism as a celebration of motherhood that encourages agency and autonomy but ultimately centers on intense devotion to childrearing. Samuels's TRHOP storylines and extratextual self-fashioning deploy the tenets of the new momism and disrupt its inherent white supremacy to authenticate her identity through essential oils as a wellness commodity and curate an affective space for black women with her NFLM lifestyle brand. © 2019 The Author.","Brand; Bravo; Celebrity; Essential Oils; Motherhood; The New Momism",,,,,,,,"Ashcroft, B., Griffiths, G., Tiffin, T., (2007) Key Concepts in Post-colonial Studies (2nd Ed.), , New York: Routledge; Banet-Weiser, S., (2012) AuthenticTM the Politics of Ambivalence in A Brand Culture, , New York: New York University Press; Berlant, L., (2008) The Female Complaint: The Unfinished Business of Sentimentality in American Culture, , Durham, NC: Duke University Press; Bobo, J., (1995) Black Women As Cultural Readers, , New York: Columbia University Press; Brangert, J., (2017) Welcome to the Bermuda Triangle [Television Series Episode], , In B.

In this episode, we are introduced to the terminally-ill CEO of Empire Entertainment, Lucious Lyon (Terrence Howard), who must decide which of his three sons will inherit the family business. To further complicate the decision, his ex-wife, Cookie (Taraji P. Henson), is released from prison after 17 years. The strength of the performances from the main cast, and those of celebrity guest stars, bolster the drama that unfolds, explaining why Empire was incredibly popular with audiences, and black audiences in particular. We examine the series's representations of blackness through focus group interviews with 31 black women viewers, exploring how they made sense of Cookie and compared her to black female leads on other series. Our interviews reveal that Cookie's complexities inspire identification and anxiety, engage broader debates about popular culture representations, and clarify black women's desires to see multifaceted images of themselves and their communities on television. © 2019 The Author.","Audiences; Feminist Media Studies; FOX; Race; Reception Studies; Television",,,,,,,,"Blay, Z., (2015) How Empire Broke Down Stereotypes by Embracing Them, , https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/empire-brokedown-stereotypes-by-embracing-them_us_55f99a39e4b0b48f670190c5, Huffington Post, 23 September; Bobo, J., (1995) Black Women As Cultural Readers, , New York: Columbia University Press; Bobo, J., (2002) The Color Purple: Black Women As Cultural Readers in R, , M.

By reducing media to their material forms and tracing their journey from use to disuse, the stories behind media activism start to appear. This article studies where Beirut's media waste goes and who brings it there. A women-only beach, a refugee camp from the early 20th century, and some of the most vulnerable populations in Lebanon all exist alongside Beirut's trash. They are part of the story of media in the Arab world because media are waste. While media activism in the Arab world is often marked by the visibility of bodies in protest, media waste in Lebanon is governed by a politics of invisibility that covers and hides the very social problems that media activism seeks to address. © The Author(s) 2019.","Environment; Infrastructure; Lebanon; Media Waste; You Stink.",,,,,,,,"Abu-Rish, Z., Garbage politics (2016) Middle East Research and Information Report, 45. , https://merip.org/mer/mer277/garbage-politics; (2016) The Listening Post: Lebanon and the Sectarian Garbage Crisis [Video File], , https://youtube.com/watch?v=RWSXzF1LHOM, October 31 Al-Jazeera English; Al Kantar, B., A Costa Brava landfill for waste: A thousand tons per day contaminate the sea and suffocate the air (2015) Al Akhbar, , https://al-akhbar.com/Community/15370, February 7; Battah, H., Game of drones (2016) Beirut Report, , http://www.beirutreport.com/2016/03/game-of-drones.html, March 11; Beck, M., Contextualizing the current social protest movement in Lebanon (2015) E-International Relations, , https://e-ir.info/2015/10/10/contextualizing-the-current-social-protest-movement-in-lebanon/, October 10; Cubitt, S., (2016) Finite Media: Environmental Implications of Digital Technologies, , Durham, NC: Duke University Press; Curtin, M., Sanson, K., (2016) Precarious Creativity: Global Media, Local Labor, , Berkeley, CA: University of California Press; Dajani, N., The myth of media freedom in Lebanon (2013) Arab Media & Society, 18. , https://www.arabmediasociety.com/the-myth-of-media-freedom-inlebanon/; Deeb, L., Harb, M., (2013) Leisurely Islam: Negotiating Geography and Morality in Shi'ite South Beirut, , Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press; Diamond, L., Plattner, M.F., (2012) Liberation Technology, , Baltimore, MD: Johns Hopkins University Press; El Hibri, H., The cultural logic of visibility in the Arab uprisings (2014) International Journal of Communication, 8, pp. 835-852. , http://ijoc.org/index.php/ijoc/article/view/2450/1106; Francis, E., No end to crisis in sight as Lebanon's garbage mountains grow (2018) Reuters, , https://reuters.com/article/us-lebanon-garbage/no-end-tocrisis-in-sight-as-lebanons-garbage-mountains-grow-idUSKBN1FO0F1, February 4; Gabrys, J., (2013) Digital Rubbish: A Natural History of Electronics, , Ann Arbor, MI: University of Michigan Press; Geha, C., Politics of a garbage crisis: Social networks, narratives, and frames of Lebanon's 2015 protests and their aftermath (2019) Social Movement Studies, 18, pp. 78-92; Gitelman, L., (2006) Always Already New: Media, History, and the Data of Culture, , Cambridge, MA: MIT Press; Hamill, K., Policy paper on reforming the ""sponsorship system"" for migrant domestic workers: Towards an alternative governance scheme in Lebanon (2012) Kafa, , http://kafa.org.lb/studiespublicationpdf/prpdf47.pdf; Harb, M., Deeb, L., Sanctioned pleasures: Youth, piety and leisure in Beirut (2007) Middle East Research and Information Report, 37, , https://merip.org/mer/mer245/sanctioned-pleasures; Herbert, D., The movie business as waste management industry (2016) Media Industries, 3 (1), pp. 18-33; Hill, E., (2016) Never Done: A History of Women's Work in Media, , New Brunswick, NJ: Rutgers University Press; Kelly, C.R., The toxic screen: Visions of petrochemical America in HBO's True Detective (2014) (2017) Communication, Culture & Critique, 10, pp. 39-57; Khalil, J., Lebanon's waste crisis: An exercise in participation rights (2017) New Media & Society, 5, pp. 701-712; Kraidy, M.M., (2016) The Naked Blogger of Cairo, , Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press; Kraidy, M.M., Trashing the sectarian system?

To date, however, we know too little about the ways in which populist discourse is constructed by citizens on social media. To advance the field, this study draws on a qualitative content analysis of Facebook posts by ordinary citizens in the Netherlands. The results indicate that Facebook offers a discursive opportunity structure for Dutch citizens to vent their populist discontent and to interact with like-minded others. Online populist discourse on Facebook is hostile and uncivil, predominately targeted at the elites and marginalized groups in society.

Through an examination of corporate blogs and sponsored stories, this article argues these companies cultivate risk along two related axes: (a) fear of dangerous others; and (b) fear of the threat posed by personal information available to others. Through sponsored stories and promotional material, these companies encourage people to mitigate risk by using consumer background check services to seek out information about others and review available details about themselves. Consistent with other forms of risk anxiety in modern cultures, the advice offered by these companies encourages the acceptance of personal responsibility around the acquisition of and response to this information. This article concludes by arguing the cultivation of reputation anxiety around digital skeletons-belonging both to others and to oneself-is rooted in gendered notions of safety and personal responsibility. © 2019 The Author(s).

This article explores Univision's new linguistic flexibility via two emblematic reality TV shows: Nuestra Belleza Latina (2007-) and La Banda (2015-). Through a textual analysis of these shows and industrial analysis of the strategies deployed by the network, the authors argue that Univision's targeting of ""billennials""-bicultural and bilingual millennials-prompted a linguistic flexibility that challenges the traditional lineup of neutral, Spanish-only, television, and is more inclusive of Latina/o audiences' language use. © 2019 The Author(s).

The study entailed content analysis of five Turkish newspapers. A keyword search of the words Syrian (Suriyeli) and refugee (mülteci) were entered into the archives of these newspapers. The search yielded a total of 2,887 news articles and 373 commentary items. The results display the significance of Cultural Fusion Theory principles and challenges that exist to achieve effective cultural fusion. © 2019 The Author(s).

Based upon a two-year ethnography with nine black artists during a period of racial unrest, this study presents how their experiences as black Americans informed distinctive, critical design dispositions. The participants' deeply personal and labor-intensive design processes were both technical and political processes that involved intense prototyping, research and self-reflection. Their designs resulted in oppositional films, photography exhibits and paintings that contested racial metonymy through visceral and visual discourses that present black identities and histories within a more complex racial language. The participants also designed empathic spaces where oppositional discourses could take root and that supported communal healing, mourning and celebration. The ethnographic accounts of this study offer a meaningful way to engage and bridge scholarship about race, design and oppositional art. © The Author(s) 2019.","Art; Critical Race Studies; Cultural Studies.; Design; Oppositional Media",,,,,,,,"Alexander, M., (2011) The New Jim Crow: Mass Incarceration in the Age of Colorblindness, , New York, NY: The New Press; Attfield, J., FORM/feMale FOLLOWS FUNCTION/Male: Feminist Critiques of Design (1989) Design History or the History of Design, pp. 201-208. , In J.

The advertisements in my case study show a spectrum of performance, from dads who justify their domestic labor with appeals to hegemonic masculinity to dads who seem at ease in historical ly feminized roles.

With a plethora of good conservatives and its stable of liberal pundits, the cable network has painted the president as mentally ill or declining, an incompetent purveyor of chaos. In perpetuating a mantra of this is not who we are in coverage of overt racism, MSNBC pivots to a more comfortable mainstream space of post-race, an ideological stance that places racism as a fringe anomaly. The post-race pivot belies the country's ongoing racist legacy, and potentially lulls viewers toward acceptance of official antiracisms that serve hegemonic interests. Thus, the news coverage of the current presidency plays a role in forestalling a meaningful reckoning with the country's ongoing history of institutional and everyday racism. © The Author(s) 2019.","News Media; Overt Racism; Populism; Post-Race; Post-Truth.",,,,,,,,"I am part of the resistance inside the Trump Administration (2018) New York Times, , https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/05/opinion/trump-white-house-anonymous-resistance.html, September 5 Anonymous; Astor, M., John Kelly pins civil war on a ""lack of ability to compromise (2017) The New York Times, , https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/31/us/johnkelly-civil-war.html, October 31; Bell, K.M., By any other name: Media and white-supremacist terrorism in the Trump Pera (2018) The Trump Presidency, Journalism and Democracy, , In R.

The term shoppable life is intended to capture the ideas that: (a) social media users perform lifestyles whose constituent elements can be bought; and (b) sociality increasingly unfolds within platforms that encode marketplace logics and capacities into their designs. Drawing on literatures about consumer culture, celebrity, and digital labor; interviews with 25 participants in Instagram's influencer economy; and industry texts, we elucidate the power dynamics and contradictions manifested in constructing a shoppable life. We emphasize how social media users navigate the imperative to produce an ""authentic"" but branded and monetizable self, the personal risk they bear in doing so, and the stakeholders who mediate and profit from these productions. We also highlight conceptual points of entry for critical attention to the logic of shoppability, which increasingly pervades spaces and cultures. © 2019 The Author(s).","Consumer Culture; Digital Labor; Fashion; Influencers; Instagram; Lifestyle; Shoppable Media; Social Media",,,,,,,"In February 2017, Tommy Hilfiger introduced Tommyland Snap:Shop, an app that lets users shop for fashion apparel and accessories by photographing the items they encounter in advertisements, on billboards, and worn by celebrities, runway models, or fellow passersby. The app is supported by Slyce, a vendor of image-recognition technology, which calls itself “the want engine.” “Through the power of visual search,” Slyce promises in a promotional video, “the physical world becomes a storefront.” The company’s website invites prospective users to simply “shop the world you see.” The notion that almost anything in our visual environments can be linked to and procured from a digital retail platform is only the latest expression of an aggressively expanding logic of shoppability.

In my analysis, I examine the performances of identity in videos created by North American fans of Korean popular culture who film themselves watching music videos for the first time. This understanding of fans outside of Korea centralizes their situated experiences and intimate community engagement. Rather than discussing transnational and online spaces as disembodied and place-less, it is crucial to recognize the material realities connected to these spaces, particularly on platforms that rely primarily on visual creative expression. I argue that the K-pop reaction video functions to represent the fluid complexities of transnationalism, while also embracing the tangible significance of place, body, and emotion. © 2018 The Author(s).","Embodiment; Korean Popular Music (K-pop); New Media; Place; Reaction Videos; Transnationalism; YouTube",,,,,,,,"Home [YouTube Channel], , https://www.youtube.com/user/2MinJinkJongKey, 2MinJinkJongKey.

Drawing from a discursive archive comprising cultural artifacts, the movement's policy statements, and augmented by interviews, this Foucault-inspired study reveals how “propaganda of protest” became a “pillar” of the Solidarity movement's campaigning. This study analyzes propaganda strategies and tactics for mobilization and political engagement among Poles, and how campaigning aided power shifts between the movement and the authorities. Contextualizing this analysis in the Sovietized settings, this study shows that propaganda was inherent to Solidarity's transgressive and subversive campaigning in multiple areas of the movement's agency: mobilization and support building, construction of collective identities, coalition-building, issues management and policymaking, and implementation. Finally, I argue, that the qualities of Solidarity's propaganda were culturally-grounded, based on the self-presentation strategies as well as the zeitgeist belief in engagement of workers' with trade unionism rather than policies of the state socialist regime. © The Author(s) 2018.","Campaigning; Foucault; Propaganda; Protest; Social Movement",,,,,,,,"Aleksandrowicz, D., Sonntag, S., Wielghos, J., (2010) The Polish Solidarity Movement in Retrospect: A Story of Failure of Success?, , Berlin, Germany: Berliner Debatte; Anderson, W.B., Social movements and public relations in the early twentieth century: How one group used public relations to curtain ventral disease rates (2017) Journal of Public Relations Research, 29 (1), pp. 3-15; Moloney, K., McQueen, D., Surowiec, P., Yaxley, H., (2013) Dissent and Protest Public Relations, , http://research.bournemouth.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Dissent-and-public-relations-Bournemouth-University.pdf, Retrieved from; Arnason, J., Culture, historicity and power: Reflections on some themes in the work of Alain Touraine (1986) Theory, Culture & Society, 3 (3), pp. 137-152; Bądkowski, L., Obowiązek Prawdy (1981) Pomerania, 7, pp. 33-36; Berger, B., Reber, B., (2005) Gaining Influence in Public Relations: The Role of Resistance in Practice, , Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates; Cammaerts, B., Protest logics and the mediated opportunity structure (2012) European Journal of Communication, 27 (2), pp. 117-134; (2010) Solidarność-Doświadczenie, Pamięć i Dziedzictwo, , Centrum Badania Opinii Społecznej Warszawa, Poland: CBOP; Coombs, T., Holladay, S., Fringe public relations: How activism moves critical PR toward the mainstream (2012) Public Relations Review, 38, pp. 880-887; Corner, J., Mediated politics, promotional culture and the idea of “propaganda (2007) Media, Culture & Society, 29 (4), pp. 669-677; Curry, J.L., (1990) Poland'S Journalists: Professionalism and Politics, , Cambridge, England: Cambridge University Press; Demetrious, K., (2013) Public Relations, Activism and Social Change: Speaking up, , New York: Routledge; Downing, J., Social movement theories and alternative media: An evolution and critique (2008) Communication, Culture & Critique, 1 (1), pp. 40-50; Dozier, D., Lauzen, M., Liberating the intellectual domain from the practice: Public relations activism, and the role of the scholar (2000) Journal of Public Relations Research, 12 (1), pp. 3-22; Eriksson, K., Foucault, Deleuze, and the ontology of networks (2005) The European Legacy, 10 (6), pp. 595-610; Fallaci, O., Poland will never go back (1981) Chicago Tribune, p. 9. , 16 March; Foucault, M., La philosophie structuraliste permet de diagnostiquer ce qu'est “aujourd'hui (1967) Dits Et Écrits: 1954-1988, pp. 580-584. , D.

Drawing on qualitative interviews and online data from a range of digital sites, I advance the central argument that digitally-mediated interpersonal connections are critical components of contemporary motherhood, but that these ties have complex positive and less than positive nuances in the perinatal period. Unpacking this argument in three steps, I first discuss how the moral weight of motherhood in neoliberal societies, rendered particularly visible in the perinatal period, complicates a central boundary in the study of online interpersonal relationships between information and communication. Second, I note the relative significance, in emotional terms, of temporally-contained social ties in digitally-mediated perinatal connections. Third, I consider how the material and emotional roles of traditionally held-to-be-important offline maternal support networks are re-negotiated, re-positioned and even bypassed through online ties. © The Author(s) 2018.

Based on interviews with Tupac Shakur fans about his recent biopic and their histories with the rapper's music, we demonstrate the emotional investments fans have in the artist's image and their individual and communal connections to his memory. The 2017 biopic All Eyez on Me (AEoM) sparked public discussion of Shakur's legacy and prompted his fans to reflect on the importance of his work in their identity development. Specifically, they connected with him through deeply felt moments of commonality and family experience. Revisiting their connection to Shakur through the biopic functioned as intimate heritage, as fans used a variety of mediated forms to reflect on their lives through the symbolic record of Shakur's life. Therefore, the movie's content was secondary to the ways a mediated discussion of the artist facilitated fans' self-reflection. © The Author(s) 2018.

Peer-production and contribution cultures are enfolded in a dynamic of resistance and appropriation in relation to capitalism. Opensource and contribution-based cultural processes have been critiqued as tending towards bureaucracy or becoming enfolded in a never-ending neoliberal imaginary from which escape or transcendence become impossible. An examination of the values expressed within a peer-production community challenges these perspectives and shows how ""operational pragmatics"" can provide moral justifications through reference to matters of principle and matters of design. Conflating these matters complicates claims about the inherent virtues of participation, especially in technical cultures. A qualitative analysis of an open-source hardware project shows how competing moral justifications unfold, and how the challenges that they pose to capitalism may be tenuous or temporary because of the way that justificatory regimes work within technology development under capitalism. © The Author(s) 2018.

The analysis reveals the depth and pervasiveness of their political influence; a proxy for media elite power. Exploring the ideological framing of the issues on which these companies lobby offers insights into how this power operates, subsuming the public interest under corporate priorities. Finally, analyzing tensions between state and lobby interests reveals both the implications of their political activity and the contours of lobbying as an instrument of media elite power. © The Author(s) 2018.

However, the implications of this new activism for defining ""social movement,"" including the term's historical emphasis on embodiment, deserve further inquiry. In response, this article focuses on the Twitter campaign, #CripTheVote. The campaign is an exemplar of activism that expands upon what constitutes social movement to include new forms of digital expression in ways that uniquely address the concerns of disabled populations and challenge the compulsory able-bodiedness of ""movement"" necessitating embodiment. Major themes of accommodation information, candidate awareness, and voter pride demonstrate that members of the campaign simultaneously encourage participation in normative systems of democratic engagement (i.e., voting) along with efforts at broader ideological change (i.e., placing greater awareness on disability issues in society) within the #CripTheVote hashtag campaign, therefore constituting new forms of social movement. © The Author(s) 2018.

In discussing representations of Black girlhood in Brazil I draw attention to the importance of Brazilian and Afro-Brazilian culture to understanding the empowerment of Black girls. In Brazil, girls of African descent operate in a national context that centers narratives of whitening, racial mixture, and the denial of Blackness as a category. Additionally, Black girls experience aesthetic standards that value Whiteness and their general invisibility in public culture, which can contribute to low self-esteem. The recent rise of MC Soffia, a Black girl MC, and short films by Afro-Brazilian women demonstrate that cultural traditions and acts are central to Black girls' empowerment. © 2017 International Communication Association","Black Girlhood; Critical Race Studies; Images of Childhood/Children; Latin America; Race",,,,,,,,"Alves, J.A., I've killed, I've robbed, I'm a man: Narratives of violence, White ImagiNations and the making of Black masculinity in “City of God (2014) Revista Ciencias Sociales, 13, pp. 313-337; Araújo, J.Z., (2000) A Negação do Brasil: o Negro na Telenovela Brasileira, , São Paulo, Brazil, Editora Senac; Barbon, J., (2015) Meninas rappers atraem atenção com músicas sobre racismo e igualdade., Folha de São Paulo, , http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/folhinha/2015/10/1694743-meninas-rappers-chamam-atencao-com-rimas-sobre-racismo-e-igualdade.shtml, 17 October, Retrieved from; Burdick, J., (1998) Blessed Anastácia: Women, race, and popular Christianity in Brazil, , New York, NY, Routledge; Caldwell, K.L., ""Look at her hair"": The body politics of Black womanhood in Brazil (2004) Transforming Anthropology, 11 (2), pp. 18-29; Caldwell, K.L., (2007) Negras in Brazil: Re-envisioning Black women, citizenship, and the politics of identity, , New Brunswick, NJ, Rutgers University Press; Chatelain, M., (2015) South side girls: Growing up in the great migration, , Durham, NC, Duke University Press; Cox, A.M., (2015) Shapeshifters: Black girls and the choreography of citizenship, , Durham, NC, Duke University Press; Dennison, S., Blonde bombshell: Xuxa and notions of Whiteness in Brazil (2013) Journal of Latin American Cultural Studies, 22 (3), pp. 287-304; Durham, M.G., Quvenzhané and the comedians: Black girlhood and sexuality at the “edge” of mediated humor (2015) Communication, Culture and Critique, 8 (4), pp. 505-521; Ferreira da Silva, D., The drama of modernity: Race and representation in television soap operas in Brazil (1999) Black Brazil: Culture, identity, and social mobilization, , In, L.

Many of the popular heroes and symbols discussed here have direct and indirect connotations that extend beyond the national boundaries of individual countries, especially since the regional sectarian conflict is very dominant. The article relies on YouTube videos and screenshots taken from a variety of sources and argues that these symbols, heroes, and media productions play an important role in propagating popular political and religious beliefs that contribute toward the solidification of a distinctly Iraqi Shiite Ummah identity whose shared values demarcate them from the rest of the society. © 2017 International Communication Association","ISIS; Mediated Symbolism; Religious Symbolism; Sectarianism; Shiism; Social Media",,,,,,,,"Abdul-Ahad, G., (2016) The battle for Falluja “If they lose it, ISIS is finished.”, The Guardian, , https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jun/03/battle-for-falluja-isis-iraq-shia-militias, 3 June, Retrieved from; (2015) A speech of the Deputy President Mr. Nouri Al Maliki during the Zubaid tribes' conference in Karbala, , https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfUYGspFpR4, 7 November, Retrieved from; Aghaie, K.S., (2004) The Martyrs of Karbala: Shi'i symbols and rituals in modern Iran, , Seattle, University of Washington Press; Araby, A., (2016) The images of Namr, Badr Al Deen#x0026; Nasrallah on Fallujah's rockets, , https://goo.gl/FQ9FuV, 26 May, Retrieved from; (2015) Video of celebrity Iraq fighter slicing body goes viral, , http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2015/08/video-celebrity-iraq-fighter-slicing-body-viral-150828145749447.html, 28 August, Retrieved from; The most prominent Shiite armed groups in Iraq, , http://goo.gl/Jue6ST, Retrieved from; Al Marashi, I., (2015) The angel of death is coming for you, ISIL, , http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2015/03/angel-death-coming-isil-150318114637222.html, 18 March, Retrieved from; Al-Rawi, A., Video games, terrorism, and ISIS's Jihad 3.0 (2016) Terrorism and Political Violence, 28 (4), pp. 1-35; Al-Rawi, A., (2016) The online response to the Quran-burning incidents.

However, community radio broadcasting in Northern Senegal has also become a domain for the practice of language activism on behalf of Pulaar, a language spoken by a significant minority of Senegalese and Mauritanians. The stations devote many of their programs to discussions and talk shows intended to encourage linguistic loyalty and purity among audience members, who reside on both sides of the Senegal–Mauritania border. Drawing on recorded broadcasts, interviews, and participant–observation conducted among radio staff members and listeners, this article examines the connections that the stations have with a decades-old movement to promote Pulaar. © 2017 International Communication Association","Activism Media; Africa/n Media; Anthropology; Broadcasting (Radio); Ethnic Minorities and Media Use; Ethnography and Media; Fulɓe and Haalpulaar'en",,,,,,,,"Anderson, B., (1998) The spectre of comparisons: Nationalism, southeast Asia and the world, , London, England, Verso; Appadurai, A., (1996) Modernity at large, , Minneapolis, University of Minnesota Press; Barlow, W., Community radio in the US: The struggle for a democratic medium (1988) Media, Culture & Society, 10, pp. 81-105; Barry, M., (2013) Médias et pouvoir au Sénégal depuis les indépendances, (1960). , www.theses.fr, Doctoral dissertation.

It demonstrates how the Hazara community, a religious and ethnic minority from Afghanistan, uses folk music as an alternative media form to resist official and exclusionary narratives. It argues that folk music among socially excluded minority groups serves as something more than mere entertainment—it functions as a tactical medium. Drawing on the song texts of Hazara folk music, particularly the works of the Sarkhosh brothers, this article explores how the experience of persecution and forced migration transformed the way this community makes music. The article also shows how the mediatisation of their folk songs helped the Hazara people overcome the Islamic stigmatization of instrumental music. © 2017 International Communication Association","Audiocassette; Dambura; Folk Music; Forced Migration; Hazara People; Tactical Media",,,,,,,,"No way (2014) You will not make Australia home – English [Video file], , https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rT12WH4a92w, Retrieved from; Ahmadi, M., (2017) Shi'ite religious leaders in Afghanistan ban musical festival, , https://www.voanews.com/a/shiite-religious-leaders-in-afghanistan-ban-musicl-festival/3927987.html, 5 July, Retrieved 20 July 2017, from; Akbar, A., (2012) New hazaragi song for australlia (RMC Quetta) [Video file], , https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jU6Db00A630, Retrieved from; Baily, J., So near, so far: Kabul's music in exile (2005) Ethnomusicology Forum, 14 (2), pp. 213-233. , https://doi.org/10.1080/17411910500329658; Baily, J., (2015) War, exile and the music of Afghanistan: The ethnographer's tale, , Burlington, VT, Ashgate; Dorson, R.M., Mythology and folklore (1973) Annual Review of Anthropology, 2 (1), pp. 107-126. , https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev.an.02.100173.000543; Emadi, H., The Hazaras and their role in the process of political transformation in Afghanistan (1997) Central Asian Survey, 16 (3), pp. 363-387.. , https://doi.org/10.1080/02634939708400997; Ferdinand, K., (1959) Preliminary notes on Hazara culture: The Danish scientific mission to Afghanistan 1953–55, , Copenhagen, Denmark, Ejnar Munksgaard; Friedman, U., (2015) The black route of death from Syria., The Atlantic, , http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2015/08/the-black-route-of-death-from-syria/402802/, August 28, Retrieved from; Garcia, D., Lovink, G., (1997) The ABC of tactical media, , http://www.nettime.org/Lists-Archives/nettime-l-9705/msg00096.html, May 16, Retrieved 29 August 2016, from; (2013) Dawood Sarkhosh - Kashki Kafar Bodi [Video file], , http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkzdpwW9K5s&feature=youtube_gdata_player, 12 May.

With an impressive career that began with “lowbrow” national television and made the leap to prestigious transnational coproductions, Darin's unique journey to international stardom allows us to address important questions regarding current processes of star formation in globalized cultural industries. This article uses the case study as the basis for a broader argument about the main discursive devices and marketing strategies that encourage or impede the reception and consumption of peripheral stars in different geopolitical regions.

The article expands on existing literature related to branding, which argues that branding functions as a mechanism of governance—a means of “conducting the conduct” of potential consumers. Equally important, the author suggests, are the ways in which branding has been mobilized by opioid manufacturers as a tool for responding to the ongoing crisis of overdoses and deaths. Thus, examining the branding of opioids enables us to better understand why these drugs continue to be prescribed and consumed, despite public awareness of the dangers associated with their use. © 2017 International Communication Association","Branding; Corporate Responsibility; Governance; Opioid Epidemic; Opioids; OxyContin; Pharmaceuticals; Training",,,,,,,,"Achenbach, J., (2016) An addiction crisis along the “backbone of America.”, The Washington Post, , https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/to-your-health/wp/2016/12/30/an-addiction-crisis-along-the-backbone-of-america/?utm_term=.556dd57843e1, 30 December, Retrieved from; Achenbach, J., Keating, D., (2017) New research identifies a “sea of despair” among white, working-class Americans., The Washington Post, , https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/new-research-identifies-a-sea-of-despair-among-white-working-class-americans/2017/03/22/c777ab6e-0da6-11e7-9b0d-d27c98455440_story.html?utm_term=.f2a090a3d79c, 22 March, Retrieved from; Angell, M., (2004) The truth about drug companies: How they deceive us and what to do about it, , New York, NY, Random House; Armstrong, D., Secret trove reveals bold “crusade” to make OxyContin a blockbuster (2016) STAT, , https://www.statnews.com/2016/09/22/abbott-oxycontin-crusade/, Retrieved from; Banet-Weiser, S., (2012) Authentic™: The politics of ambivalence in a brand culture, , New York, NY, New York University Press; Bourdet, K., How big pharma hooked America on legal heroin (2012) Vice, , http://motherboard.vice.com/read/how-big-pharma-hooked-america-on-legal-heroin, Retrieved from; Case, A., Deaton, A., Rising morbidity and mortality in midlife among white non-Hispanic Americans in the 21st century (2015) Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, 112 (49), pp. 15078-15083; (2011) Prescription painkiller overdoses at epidemic levels [press release], , https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2011/p1101_flu_pain_killer_overdose.html, Retrieved from; (2016) Wide-ranging online data for epidemiologic research (WONDER), , http://wonder.cdc.gov, National Center for Health Statistics.

Second, we find that complaints that make it to media regulators are just the tip of iceberg.

We treat their display of motherhood as a regulatory space where ideas about the maternal and fantasies of the “good life” under neoliberal rationality are formulated and normalized. Situating Shanghai and London outdoor advertisements within their respective media cultures, we identify two common themes: (a) mothers as self-responsible individuals managing the family, and (b) public display of maternity and intimate family life. We discuss similarities and differences in depictions of motherhood and the purportedly normative ideas about the “good life” they suggest. We argue that outdoor advertising acts as a visual disciplinary space regulating fantasies of the “good life” that millions of city dwellers consume, but rarely realize. © 2017 International Communication Association","Advertising; Comparison; Good Life; Mothers; Neoliberal Rationality; Visuality",,,,,,,,"Addison, H., Goodwin-Kelly, M.K., Roth, E., (2009) Motherhood misconceived: Representing the maternal in U.S. films, , #x0026;, Albany, State University of New York Pres; Akass, K., Motherhood and myth-making: Dispatches from the frontline of the US mommy wars (2012) Feminist Media Studies, 12 (1), pp. 137-141; Allen, K., Taylor, Y., Placing parenting, locating unrest: Failed femininities, troubled mothers and riotous subjects (2012) Studies in the Maternal, 4 (2), pp. 1-25; Anagnost, A., The corporeal politics of quality (Suzhi) (2004) Public Culture, 16 (2), pp. 189-208; Bergère, M.C., (2009) Shanghai: China's gateway to modernity, , Stanford, CA, Stanford University Pres; Berlant, L., (2011) Cruel optimism, , Durham, NC, Duke University Pres; Berry, C., Images of urban China in Cao Fei's “magical metropolises (2015) China Information, 29 (2), pp. 202-225; (2013), http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24322313, 13 September).

It investigates the cultural transformation of labor taking place in China through the critical lens of precarious creativity. Women designers perform digital labor to de-fetishize the labor process of global fashion brands, which mythicizes class and commodity. These women's fashion work lacks official recognition as meaningful labor, while their ability to make a case for the legitimacy of their work is further diminished when the state co-opts Shanzhai for its nation-building narratives. These women's experiences of precarity and their very act of copying reveal the simultaneous possibility and impossibility of the Chinese Dream. © 2017 International Communication Association","Chinese Dream; Creative Industries; Digital Labor; Fashion Imitations; Precarious Creativity; Shanzhai; Women",,,,,,,,"Appadurai, A., (1986) The social life of things: Commodities in cultural perspective, , (Ed.)

While the high cost of broadband Internet is undeniably an obstacle to adoption, we argue that solving the problem of cost is a necessary but not sufficient solution to the digital divide. To this end, the article contends that a community's relationship to communication technology—and their ability to see it as a political and cultural tool that can be utilized not just instrumentally, but more broadly as a way to fight poverty, inequality, and other forms of oppression—is a substantial factor leading to what we call emancipatory adoption. © 2017 International Communication Association","Broadband Adoption; Collective Identity; Digital Divide; Postcolonial Studies; Urban Crisis",,,,,,,,"Agre, P., Computing as a social practice (1997) Reinventing technology, rediscovering community: Critical explorations of computing as social practice, pp. 1-17. , In, P.

Not only did broadcast television, via the vehicle of such neglected genres as sitcoms, synchronize the rhythms of daily life to its schedules, but sitcoms also recast the daily lives and experiences of the middle classes as ordinary, relatable, and achievable.

We show how the discursive violence inherent in nation branding promotes internal hegemonies and external market interests at the expense of cosmopolitan ideas of belonging and community. In Incredible India, colonial identities are reinscribed, peripheralizing India in line with the demands of global markets, privileging Western desires and imagination. Internal political hegemonies promoting India as a Hindu nation are also reflected in the campaign, marginalizing minority groups. However, the attempt to construct a unitary nation simultaneously reveals the presence of the “other,” contesting the narrative's boundaries. The analysis confirms nation branding as a fundamentally political process, implicated in the production and perpetuation of inequalities. © 2016 International Communication Association","Hindutva; India; Nation Branding; Neoliberalism; Postcolonial Criticism; Tourism and Media",,,,,,,,"Aiello, G., The “other” Europeans: The semiotic imperative of style in Euro Visions by Magnum Photos (2012) Visual Communication, 11 (1), pp. 49-77; (2016), http://indianexpress.com/article/entertainment/bollywood/amitabh-bachchan-first-choice-to-replace-aamir-khan-for-incredible-india-campaign/, 7 January)., The Indian Express, Retrieved fro; Anderson, B., (1991) Imagined communities: Reflections on the origin and spread of nationalism, , London, England, Vers; Anholt, S., (2005) Brand new justice: How branding places and products can help the developing world, , Amsterdam, The Netherlands, Elsevier Butterworth-Heineman; Anholt, S., (2007) Competitive identity: The new brand management for nations, cities and regions, , Basingstoke, England, Palgrave Macmilla; Anholt, S., Nation branding” in Asia (2008) Place Branding and Public Diplomacy, 4 (4), pp. 265-269; Anholt, S., (2009), http://www.simonanholt.com/Research/research-the-anholt-gfk-roper-nation-brands-index-sm.aspx, .

These forms of attention—to the banal details of coexistence—and attunement—to the strange sounds of everyday life in postindustrial societies—provoke a mode of “ecological thought.” As this essay argues, thinking ecologically engenders a meaningful mode of political engagement that invites reflection on the consequences of impure relations. © 2016 International Communication Association","Atmospheric Rhetoric; Ecological Thought; Ecology; Film; Safe (1995)",,,,,,,,"Abram, D., (1996) The spell of the sensuous: Perception and language in a more-than-human world, , New York, NY, Pantheon Books; Alaimo, S., (2010) Bodily natures: Science, environment, and the material self, , Bloomington, Indiana University Press; Barnett, J.T., Toxic portraits: Resisting multiple invisibilities in the environmental justice movement (2015) Quarterly Journal of Speech, 101 (2), pp. 405-425; Barnett, J.T., Politics of edibility: Reconceptualizing ecological relationality (2016) Environmental Communication, pp. 1-14; Bennett, J., (2010) Vibrant matter: A political ecology of things, , Durham, NC, Duke University Press; Booth, E.T., Spencer, L.G., Sitting in silence: Managing aural body rhetoric in public restrooms (2016) Communication Studies, 67 (2), pp. 209-226; Bouchard, D., Desai, J., There's nothing more debilitating than travel”: Locating US empire in Todd Haynes' Safe (2005) Quarterly Review of Film and Video, 22 (4), pp. 359-370; Carbaugh, D., Just listen”: “Listening” and landscape among the Blackfeet (1999) Western Journal of Communication, 63 (3), pp. 250-270; Christian, L., Of housewives and saints: Abjection, transgression, and impossible mourning in Poison and Safe (2004) Camera Obscura, 19 (3), pp. 92-123; Cox, R., Nature's “Crisis disciplines”: Does environmental communication have an ethical duty?

In this way, national narratives about independence are U.S. border rhetorics that delimit the conditions of belonging. To explore this, I analyze the discourse of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer participants in the online community, The Wedding Matters, who reworked their relationship to independence through arguments about marriage equality. Specifically, participants constructed appeals that (a) foregrounded monogamy, (b) demonstrated their desire to raise and care for children, and (c) participated in postrace narratives of success that were characterized by a precarious negotiation of (self) sufficiency and (national) loyalty. © 2016 International Communication Association","Belonging; Borders; Citizenship; Independence; Marriage; Rhetoric",,,,,,,,"Alexander, V., https://vimeo.com/12299318, Making of ""The Wedding Matters"" PSA Campaign [Video file].

The article examines how SlutWalk Korea (jabnyonhangjin) organizers bridge and traverse the cultural boundaries that arise among global SlutWalk movements, Korean feminist movements, leftist movements, and popular media. Through such traversing practices, the organizers not only produce activism as signified by posters, marches, and costumes, but also (re)construct a field of feminist cultural production. By participating in SlutWalk Korea, which recognizes their interdependence and acknowledges their interior otherness, Korean organizers create new feminist subjectivities that enable new political possibilities. © 2016 International Communication Association","Activism; Cultural Production; Feminism; Jabnyonhangjin; SlutWalk; Subjectivity; Translation",,,,,,,,"(2011), http://www.blackwomensblueprint.org/2011/09/23/an-openletter-from-black-women-to-the-slutwalk/, September 23)., An open letter from black women to the SlutWalk, Retrieved fro; Bourdieu, P., Genesis and structure of the religious field (1991) Comparative Social Research, 13, pp. 1-44; Bourdieu, P., (1993), The field of cultural production Essays on art and literature, (R.

These professionals train workers to absorb appropriate “values” and to acquire “skills” that ultimately prevent these workers from realizing their aspirations.

With the turn to the “new museum” of the 21st century, with its extensive reliance on new media, mediation, and an interactive-participatory agenda, museums are community generators that invite and display public participation. The article inquires ethnographically into the settings offered by a new and large Jewish heritage museum in Philadelphia, for the pursuit of “ordinary” people's participatory discursive practices. The article then asks how visitors actually pursue their participation discursively, in the form of texts written on notes in response to the museum's questions.

Situated between the presumed freedom of the digital economy and the feelings of risk that accompany independently contracted work under neoliberalism, these drivers evidence what we term splintering precarity—a bifurcated set of risks that stands in contrast to both certain more privileged dotcom employees who may not require a supplemental income and less privileged laborers who are denied even the “on-demand” employment of Uber and Lyft. The experience of these drivers offers an important picture of the affective impacts of the infrastructural outsourcing that characterizes much early 21st-century economics. © 2016 International Communication Association","Digital Labor; Infrastructure; Mobile Technology; Precarity; Sharing Economy",,,,,,,,"Benner, C., (2002) Work in the new economy: Flexible labor markets in Silicon Valley, , Oxford, England, Blackwel; Bennett, J., Strange, N., (2014) Media independence: Working with freedom or working for free?, , #x0026;, (Eds.)

By examining the campaign's online discourse, the study sheds light on vegetarian advocacy defined by an apolitical small-steps strategy and identifies constraints on the campaign's significant empowerment potential. Extending past scholarship on how some vegetarian discourses resist and reproduce meat-eating culture's hegemonic norms of gender, race/ethnicity, class, and human–nonhuman relations, I develop and demonstrate what I call the critique of neoliberal backgrounding as an intersectional ecofeminist heuristic. I conclude that the campaign should address the meaningful consequences that its affirmation of neoliberalism has for its targeted areas of concern and for interconnected societal problems. © 2016 International Communication Association","Discourses of Meat Consumption; Ecofeminism; Intersectionality; Neoliberalism; Popular Dieting Discourse; Vegetarianism",,,,,,,,"Adams, C.J., (2004), The sexual politics of meat A feminist-vegetarian critical theory, (10th anniversary ed.).

In Perry's November 2013 performance of “Unconditionally,” she used Orientalist imagery of premodern Japan, and in Lavigne's 2014 single “Hello Kitty,” she used techno-Orientalist imagery of Harajuku street fashion, kawaii, and Japanese-as-cyborg. I argue that like White women performers, who performed Japanese femininity in the turn of the 20th century, Perry and Lavigne caricatured Japanese femininity as a hybrid costume to advance their own subjectivities. Yet, I also show through deconstructive criticism that their spectacular use of juxtaposition and excess creates “obtuse meanings” in which subversive meanings escape and opportunistically challenge the dominant meaning of the texts. © 2016 International Communication Association","Excess; Hybridity; Japanese Femininity; Popular Music; Racial Appropriation; Spectacle; White Women",,,,,,,,"Artz, L., Murphy, B.O., (2000) Cultural hegemony in the United States, , #x0026;, Thousand Oaks, CA, SAGE; Balaji, M., Worawongs, T., The new Suzie Wong: Normative assumptions of White male and Asian female relationships (2010) Communication, Culture, and Critique, 3 (2), pp. 224-241; Banes, S., (1998) Dancing women: Female bodies on stage, , New York, NY, Routledge; Barker, J.M., Out of sync, out of sight: Synaesthesia and film spectacle (2008) Paragraph, 31 (2), pp. 236-251; Barthes, R., (1977) Image/music/text, , (S.

A multimethod, primarily qualitative study in a London neighborhood exposed extensive communicative fragmentation along ethnic and class lines. Does such communicative separation lead to segregation? Is togetherness ever possible? Rather than a togetherness/separation binary, our study revealed a dialectic that rests upon diverging distribution of modes of communication in the city: Media often separate urban dwellers and face-to-face communication brings them together in momentary but important association. This dialectic and its various incarnations give rise to a spectrum of politics of conviviality: civility through Othering; civility through negotiation of We-ness and Otherness; and politics of civic engagement and solidarity. © 2016 International Communication Association","City; Conviviality; Cultural Diversity; Migration; Otherness; Urban Communication; Urban Politics",,,,,,,,"Amin, A., (2012) Land of strangers, , Cambridge, England, Poli; Anderson, E., (2011) The cosmopolitan canopy: Race and civility in everyday life, , New York, NY, W.

To narrow this gap, this study investigates audience participation in one alternative media outlet: community radio. Case studies were conducted on 2 U.S. community radio stations through participatory ethnography, in-depth interviews, and a listener survey. Results suggest that community radio continues to be relevant in this digital era. While people lose faith in mainstream media and become increasingly suspicious of online content, they still consider community radio the most trustworthy. The study also demonstrates the limitations of audience participation in community radio, and the difficulties this medium faces in adopting new technologies and adapting to this digital world. © 2015 International Communication Association","Alternative Media; Audience Research; Community Media; Community Radio; New Communication Technologies",,,,,,,,"Atkinson, J.D., Dougherty, D.S., Alternative media and social justice movements: The development of a resistance performance paradigm of audience analysis (2006) Western Journal of Communication, 70 (1), pp. 64-88. , #x0026;; Atton, C., (2004) An alternative Internet: Radical media, politics and creativity, , Edinburgh, Scotland, Edinburgh University Press; Balli, C., (2013), http://www.texasmonthly.com/story/what-nobody-says-about-, February).

Through observations of online fan discussions and in-depth interviews with 12 fans, I show that they use European football to articulate distinct fan identities and their particular positionalities. These fans contrast the realism of mediated sport with realism in other entertainment genres to distinguish themselves from other sport and slash fan practices. Furthermore, while these slash fans critique feminine gender norms in their claim to sexual agency, their taste for European football is racialized in problematic ways. The particular economic, social, and cultural subject positions of these fans act as structuring factors that influence their taste for slashing European football. © 2015 International Communication Association","Judgment of Realism; Media Reflexivity; Mediated Sport; Queered Interpretation; Slash Football Fans; Taste",,,,,,,,"Armstrong, G., Rosbrook-Thompson, J., Coming to America: Historical ontologies and United States football (2010) Identities: Global Studies in Culture and Power, 17 (4), pp. 348-371. , #x0026;; Bacon-Smith, C., (1991) Enterprising women: Television fandom and the creation of popular myth, , Philadelphia, University of Pennsylvania Press; Bourdieu, P., (1984) Distinction: A social critique of the judgment of taste, , Cambridge, MA, University of Harvard Press; Buckingham, D., (2005), http://eprints.ioe.ac.uk, The media literacy of children and young people A review of the research literature on behalf of Ofcom, Retrieved from; Cashmore, E., (2002) Beckham, , Cambridge, England, Polity; Chen, A., The new inequality: China's changing of the guard (2003) Journal of Democracy, 14 (1), pp. 51-59; Cicioni, M., Male pair-bonds and female desire in fan slash writing (1998) Theorizing fandom: Fans, subculture, and identity, pp. 153-178. , In, C.

Analyzing the girls' discourse, we find that they identify a correlation between sexually explicit images and high ratings, and that they use both psychological and economic frames to interpret this relationship. We suggest that ironically, the quantified explicitness of Liking crystalizes for the girls the price tag for each choice that they make, the double standard that underlies this economy—and their ability to tease and to challenge it. © 2016 International Communication Association","Economy of Visibility; Focus Groups; Girls; Like Button; Photography; Rating; Selfies; Social Network Sites",,,,,,,,"Aapola, S., Gonick, M., Harris, A., (2005) Young femininity: Girlhood, power and social change, , #x0026;, Basingstoke, England, Palgrave Macmilla; Attwood, F., Sexed up: Theorizing the sexualization of culture (2006) Sexualities, 9 (1), pp. 77-94; Banet-Weiser, S., (1999) The most beautiful girl in the world: Beauty pageants and national identity, , Berkeley, University of California Pres; Banet-Weiser, S., Am I pretty or ugly?

The HBO series True Detective is an exemplary case study in how evocative toxic images can be integrated into familiar television narratives to animate society's deadly relationship with toxic chemicals. The petrochemical mise-en-scene of True Detective enlivens the toxic image with inferential power, or visual enthymemes, that invite audiences to draw connections between traumas that unfold through narrative action and omnipresence of toxic iconography.

Unshackled from the prescribed social norms and commitments of socialism, individuals were thrown into a hitherto unavailable space in which they could experiment with different modes of self-formation. With this came an urgent need for guidance to help citizens find their bearings in the new moral-sexual-economic order. Tracking the emergence of some new radio and television formats over the past 3 decades, and taking an approach that is at once political-economic and cultural, we analyze the role of the Chinese media in producing advice on love and personal relationships in the reform era, paying attention to the paradoxical relationship between intimacy construction and advice provision. © 2016 International Communication Association","Advice Media; Intimacy; Love and Relationships; Privatization; Radio; Television",,,,,,,,"Bai, R., Song, G., (2015) Chinese television in the twenty-first century: Entertaining the nation, , #x0026;, (Eds.)

Some animated texts do not, however, easily fit this characterization. One example is the series Heidi, Girl of the Alps, which spread to some 35 countries starting in the late 1970s. This article explores the consequences of scholars' failure to engage with Heidi despite its significance as an extremely globally influential text and an exemplar of Miyazaki's early work. Exploring how Heidi resonates with dimensions of Japanese culture and of Miyazaki's oeuvre, it demonstrates how “reclaiming” Heidi can help us develop a more sophisticated understanding of transcultural dynamics under conditions of globalization. © 2015 International Communication Association","Globalization; Hybridity; Japanese Animation; Miyazaki",,,,,,,,"Allison, A., (2006) Millennial monsters: Japanese toys and the global imagination, , Berkeley, University of California Press; Appadurai, A., (2013) The future as cultural fact: Essays on the global condition, , New York, NY, Verso; (2013), http://www.post.japanpost.jp/kitte_hagaki/stamp/tokusyu/2012/h250123_t.html, January 23).

While conflict has changed significantly in the past 70 years, thinking about the relationship between identity, media representation, and conflict continues to revolve around notions of the Other. This article develops a more nuanced theory of identity and conflict, as it manifests in the phenomenon of homegrown terrorism, through the figure of the Double. The function of identity in and for conflict is explored by situating media representations of threat in the 2013 Boston Marathon bombing within theories of enmity and biopower. Ultimately, the article argues that the Double, which unsettles identity and defers its closure, is a fundamental component of the strategies and discourses of contemporary conflict. © 2015 International Communication Association","Boston Marathon Bombing; Conflict; Homegrown Terrorism; Identity; Representation; Terrorism; The Double; The Other",,,,,,,,"Alexander, J.C., From the depths of despair: Performance, counterperformance, and “September 11 (2006) Social performance: Symbolic action, cultural pragmatics, and ritual, pp. 91-114. , In, J.

In this analysis, we examine the national and international media coverage of the team to identify messages that are indicative of crisis renewal discourse—aligned with the optimistic and prospective focus on rebuilding through a shared vision.

Acknowledging the interpretive quandaries of humor and the possibilities of racist humor, this essay tells an often overlooked story of the comic “heroes” who struggle against dominant racial meanings, power relationships, and identity constructions. The essay analyzes the pedagogical possibilities of critical humorists who creatively confront hegemonic racism and whose work participates in critical projects of social, political, and cultural transformation. Such emancipatory racial humor serves as a critical public pedagogy that exposes dominant public pedagogies, injects counternarratives into the struggle over hegemony, and subverts naturalized racial meanings and privileges. © 2015 International Communication Association","Critical Public Pedagogy; Critical Race Theory; Hegemony; Humor/Comedy; Public Pedagogy; Race/Racism",,,,,,,,"Alexander, B.K., Racializing identity: Performance, pedagogy, and regret (2004) Cultural Studies/Critical Methodologies, 4 (1), pp. 12-27; Alexander, M., (2010) The new Jim Crow: Mass incarceration in the age of colorblindness, , New York, NY, New Press; Billig, M., Comic racism and violence (2005) Beyond a joke: The limits of humour, pp. 25-44. , In, S.

The Gulabi Gang represents a nodal point in a rich and complex history of resistance against gender- and caste-related violence in India. Through this analysis, I contend the group implicitly challenges the prearranged distinction between violence and legitimacy, which undergirds popular discourses, orientalist stereotypes, and much of rhetorical theory. © 2016 International Communication Association","Public/Public Sphere; Resistance; Rhetorical Theory; Social Justice; Violence",,,,,,,,"Ansari, S., Introduction (2005) Decade of the dacoits, pp. ix-xv. , In, I.

Among these sites, the article focuses on the quasi-legal banning of the Hindi film Aarakshan (2011) by the Mayawati-led state government of Uttar Pradesh. Although the state government purported to be securing public order by banning the film, critics vociferously objected to the ban as overstepping the limits of state power and violating freedom of speech. I argue that while the mainstream debate was delimited by competing constitutional claims and the ban was motivated by a display of support for a local Dalit constituency, both operated within a censorial governmentality driven by an ideal of representative censorship. © 2015 International Communication Association","Censorship; Dalit Politics; Freedom of Speech; Governmentality; Indian Cinema; Representation",,,,,,,,"(2011), pp. 1-4. , August 11)., Pioneer; (2011), http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJBR0LLX0d0, .

In this work Zephaniah also critiques the Western global order that is engaged in militaristic imperialism, counterterrorism, and securitization discourses via the “War on Terror.” Such infrapolitical blackness, as a form of dissident political subjectivity, emerges from an earlier history of African Caribbean/South Asian radical politics in Britain. Zephaniah was a key figure in this movement but now operates within the aesthetics of a new genre of music videos that constructs popular culture and transnational opposition to the “War on Terror.” In the past only music videos that achieved commercial success were regarded as important, but this is changing with the recognition of their political roles in challenging dominant ideologies and shaping unruly racial subject-positions. © 2015 International Communication Association","Black Britain; Blackness; Critical Race Theory; Ethnic Media; Globalization and Media Cultures; Music Videos; Racism; War on Terror",,,,,,,,"Ahmad, M., A rage shared by law: Post-September 11 racial violence as crimes of passion (2004) California Law Review, 92 (5), pp. 1261-1330; Alexander, C., Beyond black: Re-thinking the color/culture divide (2002) Ethnic and Racial Studies, 25 (4), pp. 552-571; Als, H., (2013), http://www.guernicamag.com/features/white-girls/, White girls, Retrieved from; Asthana, S., Patriotism and its avatars: Tracking the national-global dialectic in Indian music videos (2003) Journal of Communication Inquiry, 27 (4), pp. 337-353; Baumann, G., (1996) Contesting culture: Discourses of identity in multi-ethnic London, , Cambridge, England, Cambridge University Press; Berkeley, R., Khan, O., Ambikaipaker, M., (2006) What's new about new immigrants in 21st century Britain?, , York, England, Runnymede Trust/Joseph Rowntree; Buuck, D., Spahr, J., Poetry and other Englishes (2006) boundary 2, 33 (2), pp. 3-5; Callinicos, A., (1995) Race and class, , London, England, Bookmark; Cameron, D., (2011) PM, s speech at Munich conference, , http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20130109092234/http://number10.gov.uk/news/pms-speech-at-munich-security-conference/, , Retrieved from; Cantle, T., (2008) Community cohesion: A new framework for race and diversity, , Basingstoke, England, Palgrave Macmillan; Chen, K.-H., The (dis)appearance of postmodern semiosis or the cultural politics of resistance (1986) Journal of Communication Inquiry, 10 (1), pp. 66-69; Cole, M., (2009) Critical race theory and education: A Marxist response, , New York, NY, Palgrave Macmillan; (2013) 5 reasons I am here for Beyonce, , http://www.crunkfeministcollective.com/2013/12/13/5-reasons-im-here-for-Beyonce-the-feminist/, the feminist, Retrieved from; (2010) M, I, A, s controversial redhead genocide music video banned from YouTube, , http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-1270231/M-I-A-s-controversial-redhead-genocide-music-video-banned-YouTube.html, , Retrieved from; Davey, D., (2013) Dope songs from UK Artist Lowkey-Taking on the Obama Nation, , http://hiphopandpolitics.com/2013/10/16/3-dope-songs-uk-artist-lowkey-taking-obama-nation/, Retrieved from; Edmond, M., Here we go again: Music videos after Youtube (2014) Television & New Media, 15, pp. 305-320; Eldridge, M., The rise and fall of black Britain (1997) Transition, 74, pp. 32-43; Fanon, F., (1986) Black skin, white masks, , New York, NY, Grove Press; Gee, T., (2011) Counterpower: Making change happen, , Oxford, England, New Internationalist; Gilroy, P., (2001) Against race: Political culture beyond the color line, , Cambridge, England, Belknap Press; Goodwin, A., (1992) Dancing in the distraction factory: Music television and popular culture, , Minneapolis, University of Minnesota Press; (2014), http://www.gradientlair.com/post/73919435312/Beyonce-flawless-song-music-feminism-womanism, Beyonce, s flawless feminism, A womanist perspective, Retrieved from; Gupta, R., (2003) From homebreakers to jailbreakers: Southall black sisters, , London, England, Zed Books; Hall, S., Minimal selves (1996) Black British cultural studies, pp. 114-119. , In, H.

This study focuses on the Federal Communications Commission's Open Internet proceeding, and draws on interviews with 13 organizations and document analyses.

As a result, the Farrows and their fans helped shift news of Allen's receipt of a lifetime achievement award to a story about an affective online discourse against the filmmaker. This essay argues that the rhetorical form of the Farrows' Twitter discourse and resulting news coverage helped shift a microblogging character assault into a macrocultural controversy. Through an analysis of the controversy, this study explains that the rhetoric of this online firestorm and subsequent news coverage was not based on the revelation of new information, but on the presentation of salacious allegations against Allen. © 2015 International Communication Association","Celebrity Identification; Echo Chamber; Fan Community; Online Firestorm; Rhetorical Form; Social Media Rhetoric; Woody Allen",,,,,,,,"Ahmed, S., (2014) Ronan Farrow disses estranged dad Woody Allen's Golden Globes tribute, , http://www.cnn.com/2014/01/13/showbiz/ronan-farrow-woody-allen-tweet/, January 13). ., CNN, Retrieved from; Allen, W., (2014) Woody Allen speaks out., , http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/09/opinion/sunday/woody-allen-speaks-out.html, February 7. , The New York Times, Retrieved from; (2014) So this girl hides… [Tweet], , https://twitter.com/amandareid/status/422779328548446208, January 13).

The Israeli campaign was part of the global “Campaign for Real Beauty” launched by Unilever in 2004. The Israeli campaign was run primarily on 2 Internet platforms that appeal to women, and was based mainly on the talk of “ordinary” mothers and daughters on online videos and blogs—ostensibly personal yet produced by advertisers. Based on discourse analysis and critical examination of the consumerist and postfeminist context in which the campaign was produced, this article explores how the mother–daughter relationship suggests a new sphere for processes of branding. © 2015 International Communication Association","Authenticity; Body Image; Branding; Commodity Activism; Dove Campaign; Mother–Daughter Relations; Self-Esteem",,,,,,,,"Aapola, S., Gonick, M., Harris, A., (2005) Young femininity: Girlhood, power and social change, , New York, NY, Palgrave Macmillan; Banet-Weiser, S., (2012) Authentic: The politics of ambivalence in a brand culture, , New York, New York University Press; Banet-Weiser, S., Portwood-Stacer, L., I just want to be me again!”: Beauty pageants, reality television and post-feminism (2011) The gender and media reader, pp. 491-502. , In, M.

Through a reading of the film that juxtaposes its key narrative themes with its appropriation of a gangsta aesthetic, I argue that Office Space allows its predominantly White male characters and viewers to traverse racialized, gendered, and classed subject positions in ways that enable critiques of capitalism, Whiteness, and masculinity, but also reify White supremacy. © 2015 International Communication Association","Appropriation; Gangsta Rap; Humor; Identity; Masculinity; Office Space; Proletarian Blackface; Whiteness",,,,,,,,"(2007) Office Space, printer scene., , https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnuoON_uslI/, June 5)., YouTube, Retrieved from; Alonso, A.A., Racialized identities and the formation of Black gangs in Los Angeles (2004) Urban Geography, 25 (7), pp. 658-672; Baldwin, J., (1961) Nobody knows my name: More notes of a native son, , New York, NY, Dell; Baumgarten, M., (2009) Office spaced in Austin., , http://www.austinchronicle.com/daily/screens/2009-02-11/739833/, February 11). , The Austin Chronicle, Retrieved from; Braverman, H., (1998) Labor and monopoly capital: The degradation of work in the twentieth century—25th anniversary edition, , New York, NY, Monthly Review Press; Chaplin, C., (1936) [Motion picture]., , Modern times, Los Angeles, CA Charles Chaplin Productions; Chávez, K.R., (2013) Queer migration politics: Activist rhetoric and coalitional possibilities, , Urbana, University of Illinois Press; Cleaver, H., (2000) Reading capital politically, , Leeds, England and Edinburgh, England, Anti/Theses and AK Press, (Original work published 1979); D'Alessandro, A., (2014) Emmys Mike Judge on how Viacom-Paramount merger influenced “Silicon Valley” & “, Office Space, ”s impact on TGI Fridays, , http://www.deadline.com/2014/06/mike-judge-silicon-valley-interview-making-of/#more-743529/, June 14).

We argue that an exhaustive typology of journalism careers is needed to capture the potential variability in the structure of journalistic labor. This typology distinguishes professional, bureaucratic, entrepreneurial, unwillingly entrepreneurial, and nonemployed careers, and is relevant to a broader set of occupations in the culture industries. We illustrate this typology through an analysis of the occupational life histories of 60 Israeli journalists. This allows us to explain the dual nature of professionalism in journalism as a rhetoric nested within particular institutional contexts and this occupational rhetoric's splitting into “tribes of professionalism.”. © 2015 International Communication Association","Culture Industries; Israel; Journalism; Life Histories; Profession; Work",,,,,,"University of Haifa

Much of this work portrays the foreignness of the other Indian—particularly the North Indian—but little work exists on the construction of the non-Indian space or person. We argue that quite often films emphasize Tamil authenticity by constructing an othering-type discourse of foreign spaces and their inhabitants, including the Tamil Diaspora. Through an analysis of 90 films and 5 in-depth interviews, we demonstrate that Tamil film presents an opportunity to understand how an important regional center of Indian cinema both represents the foreign and constructs the Indian Diaspora and its spaces, while differing from the more globally known Hindi-language productions of Bollywood. © 2015 International Communication Association","Bollywood; Diaspora; Films; Foreign; Indian Cinema; Other; Tamil Cinema",,,,,,,,"Baskaran, S.T., (1996) The eye of the serpent: An introduction to Tamil cinema, , Chennai, India, East West Books; Baskaran, S.T., (2009) History through the lens: Perspectives on South Indian cinema, , Hyderabad, India, Orient Blackswan Private Limited; Devadas, V., (2011), http://www.screeningthepast.com/2011/11/rethinking-screen-encounters-cinema-and-tamil-migrant-workers-in-singapore/, .

It argues that politicized homophobia combined with moral entrepreneurship to produce influential circuits of social, moral, and political power that were deployed to elicit particular forms of subjectivity against homosexuality. The media stimulated and sustained homophobia and heterosexism, and provided a platform for politicians and other moral entrepreneurs to mobilize antipathy in support of reactionary and exclusionary interventions that are antithetical to the very essence of liberal democracy that the country professes.

In the story of a young Filipino-Korean boy's “Korean dream” to be accepted by his father/birth country and his reluctant and cynical teacher, the film reifies dominant Korean discourses of multiculturalism that are situated within local and global hierarchies. Locally, Korean multiculturalism looks down, requiring the non-White multiethnic other to integrate into dominant culture. Globally, it looks up to seek the paternal acceptance of the United States. In the film, multicultural discourses work to support the instrumental assimilation of the multiethnic other for the purposes of assimilating Korea within the ranks of “advanced” countries. © 2015 International Communication Association","Global Hierarchy; Multiculturalism; My Little Hero; South Korea",,,,,,,,"Ahn, J.-H., Transforming Korea into a multicultural society: Reception of multiculturalism discourse and its discursive disposition in Korea (2011) Asian Ethnicity, 13 (1), pp. 97-109; Ahn, J.-H., Global migration and the racial project in transition: Institutionalizing racial difference through the discourse of multiculturalism in South Korea (2013) Journal of Multicultural Discourses, 8 (1), pp. 29-47; Banes, S., (1998) Dancing women: Female bodies on stage, , New York, NY, Routledge; Cheng, S., Sexual protection, citizenship and nationhood: Prostituted women and migrant wives in South Korea (2011) Journal of Ethnic and Migration Studies, 37 (10), pp. 1627-1648; Choe, H., South Korean society and multicultural citizenship (2007) Korea Journal, 47 (4), pp. 123-146. , http://www.ekoreajournal.net/main/index.htm, Retrieved from; Choi, J., Educating citizens in a multicultural society: The case of South Korea (2010) The Social Studies, 101 (4), pp. 174-178; Chung, E.A., Kim, D., Citizenship and marriage in a globalizing world: Multicultural families and monocultural nationality laws in Korea and Japan (2012) Indiana Journal of Global Legal Studies, 19 (1), pp. 195-219. , http://ijgls.indiana.edu/, #x0026;, Retrieved from; Croucher, S., Migrants of privilege: The political transnationalism of Americans in Mexico (2009) Identities: Global Studies in Culture and Power, 16 (4), pp. 463-491; Desmond, J.C., Introduction.

Although the monopolistic model still persists, the Ethiopian government has awarded multibillion-dollar contracts to Chinese telecommunications multinationals ZTE and Huawei in the last decade. Based on analyses of interviews with policymakers and officials, this essay explores the implications of Sino-Ethiopian partnerships in Ethiopian telecommunications from a critical political economy perspective. The analysis shows that China's motives for investing in Ethiopia are predominantly economic and provide opportunities for millions of citizens. However, China's policy of noninterference and other factors make the partnership particularly attractive for Ethiopia's anocratic government, which has used China's resources to bolster its power. © 2016 International Communication Association","China; Critical Political Economy; Ethiopia; Huawei; Surveillance; Telecommunications; ZTE",,,,,,,,"Abiye, Y., (2013), http://www.thereporterethiopia.com/index.php/news-headlines/item/1217-insa-to-reign-all-powerful-over-cyberspace, November 9).

This article builds from a close reading of those videos—and survey of press coverage and relevant scholarly literature—to ask why people attributed agency to the remixed rather than the remixer when fragments were appropriated from essentially private citizens rather than celebrities. Those fragments are analyzed through a new tripartite framework for understanding the commons as a “goldmine,” “pot of dirt,” and “cutting room floor.” The concept of “transparency” allows reconception of remix neither as “bottom–up” cultural force nor as embodying the postmodern quality of being multiperspectival, but rather as subjugating individuals within the singular nonperspective of scientism. © 2015 International Communication Association","Citation; Collaboration; Commons; Critique; Digital Democracy; Remix; Transparency; Video; YouTube",,,,,,,,"Abend, L., Altman, A., Bates, T., Cruz, G., Dorfman, A., Duerr, C., (2009), http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/completelist/0,29569,1934027,00.html, .

It argues that the film, which creates troubling identifications and disidentifications for a Western spectator, offers a politically productive lesson on the power of discomfort to disrupt unethical image practices. Communication studies scholars have engaged in these conversations via studies about identification and disidentification and the documentary genre; affect in cinematic media; and more directly, through work that investigates the perils of cookie-cutter frames for representing (racialized) poverty. © 2015 International Communication Association","Affect; Disidentification; Documentary Film; Identification; Photography; Politics of Representation; Sentimentality",,,,,,,,"Aradau, C., The perverse politics of four-letter words: Risk and pity in the securitization of human trafficking (2004) Millenium—Journal of International studies, 33 (2), pp. 251-277; Azoulay, A., (2008) The civil contract of photography, , New York, NY, Zone Books; Bell, V., The burden of sensation and the ethics of form: Watching capturing the Friedmans (2008) Theory, Culture & Society, 25 (3), pp. 89-101; Berlant, L., (2008) The female complaint: The unfinished business of sentimentality in American culture, , Durham, NC, Duke University Press; Berlant, L., (2011) Cruel optimism, , Durham, NC, Duke University Press; Biesecker, B., (1997) Addressing postmodernity: Kenneth Burke, rhetoric, and a theory of social change, , Tuscaloosa, University of Alabama Press; Boltanski, L., (1999) Distant suffering: Morality, media and politics, , Cambridge, MA, Cambridge University Press; Bruzzi, S., (2006) The new documentary, , New York, NY, Routledge; Chanan, M., (2007) The politics of documentary, , London, England, British Film Institute; Chandler, D.G., The road to military humanitarianism: How the human rights NGOs shaped a new humanitarian agenda (2001) Human Rights Quarterly, 23 (3), pp. 678-700; Chouliaraki, L., Post-humanitarianism: Humanitarian communication beyond a politics of pity (2010) International Journal of Cultural Studies, 13 (2), pp. 107-126; Colleyn, J.P., (2009) Jean Rouch: cinéma et anthropologie, , Paris, France, Cahiers du cinéma; Demos, T.J., (2013) The migrant image: The art and politics of documentary during global crisis, , Durham, NC, Duke University Press; Demos, T.J., Van Gelder, H., (2013) In and out of Brussels: Figuring postcolonial Africa and Europe in the films of Herman Asselberghs, Sven Augustijnen, Renzo Martens, and Els Opsomer, 14. , #x0026;, (Eds.)

I argue that although representations of agency in the campaigns differ, they all reinforce Western assumptions about Africa to varying degrees, and entrench imperialistic power relations by portraying African agency in Western-centric ways. I examine absences and silences in the aid rhetoric with a focus on alternatives to current representations of agency, and propose that placing an emphasis on representations of collective agency could provoke a shift away from Western-centrism in aid campaigns and reinvigorate theoretical discussions of representation. © 2016 International Communication Association","Africa; Agency; Humanitarian aid; Postcolonial theory; Representation; Subaltern studies",,,,,,,,"Alhuwalia, P., (2001), Politics and post-colonial theory African inflections, London, England Routledge; Appiah, K.A., (1992) In my father's house: Africa in the philosophy of culture, , New York, NY, Oxford University Press; Asante, M.K., (1988) Afrocentricity, , Trenton, NJ, Africa World Press; Bell, K., A delicious way to help save lives”: Race, commodification, and celebrity in Product (RED) (2011) Journal of International and Intercultural Communication, 4 (3), pp. 163-180; Black, E., (1978) Rhetorical criticism: A study in method, , Madison, University of Wisconsin Press; Bose, P., (2003) Organizing empire: Individualism, collective agency, & India, , Durham, NC, Duke University Press; Campbell, K., Burkholder, T.R., (1997) Critiques of contemporary rhetoric, , #x0026;, New York, NY, Wadsworth; Carillo Rowe, A., (2008) Power lines: On the subject of feminist alliances, , Durham, NC, Duke University Press; Chakrabarty, D., (2002) Habitations of modernity: Essays in the wake of subaltern studies, , Chicago, IL, University of Chicago Press; Dempsey, S.E., NGOs, communicative labor, and the work of grassroots representation (2009) Communication and Critical/Cultural Studies, 6 (4), pp. 328-345; Dutta, M.J., Pal, M., Dialog theory in marginalized settings: A subaltern studies approach (2010) Communication Theory, 20 (4), pp. 363-386. , #x0026;; Goodwin, J., Jasper, J.M., (2003) The social movements reader: Cases and concepts, , #x0026;, (Eds.)

It combines ethnographic analysis of the street dance as a site of urban poor and Black resistance to colonial institutions with an analysis of song lyrics about video cameras at street dances. Newly networked technologies for circulating visual media in global networks affect how Jamaicans perform identity. These technologies also affect street dances' social function, evoking race- and gender-related pressures that reinforce existing and historic inequalities, reshaping and limiting street dances' traditional function as a site of autonomy and resistance to colonial inequality. A better understanding of local practices can offer an alternative conceptual framework to help practitioners, scholars, and policy and technology designers avoid reinforcing those inequalities. © 2015 International Communication Association","Development Communication; Global Media Flow; Media Policy; Music; Race and Media; Technology",,,,,,,,"Alexander, M.J., Erotic autonomy as a politics of decolonization: An anatomy of feminist and state practice in the Bahamas tourist economy (1997) Feminist genealogies, colonial legacies, democratic futures, pp. 63-100. , In, C.

Through an examination of archival materials, I demonstrate that the commodification of the Forward's content led to the production of its readership as a commodity audience. Key leaders at the newspaper aimed to rationalize the contradictions between maintaining a socialist newspaper central to an oppositional political movement and the need for advertising revenue. This entailed reimagining the audience as ethnic consumers rather than working-class socialists. This history highlights long-standing contradictions that the alternative media must reconcile between serving counterhegemonic interests and institutional demands within a capitalist political economy. © 2015 International Communication Association","Alternative Media; Commodification; Commodity Audience; Ethnicity; Political Economy; Yiddish Press",,,,,,,,"Forward association papers (Box 3, Folder 39), YIVO Archive, Center for Jewish History, New York, NY; (1931), January 15)., Forward association papers (Box 3, Folder 39), YIVO Archive, Center for Jewish History, New York, NY; (1922) Proceedings from the fifth biennial convention, , Chicago, IL, Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America; (1922), 119. , Printer's Ink, 177; Armstrong, D., (1981) A trumpet to arms: Alternative media in America, , Los Angeles, CA, Jeremy P.

Woods had been able to use his mixed-race identity to market himself broadly though the scandal effectively removed any postracial claims afforded by his multiraciality. His self-identification as mixed-race Black and Asian to a mistress brought Blasians under scrutiny, resulting in moves to protect his commodifiability. Woods offers an interesting case study of the way Blasians, and by extension non-White racially mixed people, are discussed in media. This article splits the coverage of Woods into 3 categories of racialization—pathological, comical, and recuperative. The multiple ways in which Blackness and Asianness were deployed offer an extended glimpse into the way Blasians trouble U.S. constructions of race. © 2015 International Communication Association","Asian; Black; Branding; Critical Mixed-Race; Popular Culture; Representation",,,,,,,,"Andrews, D.L., King, C.R., Leonard, D.J., America's son?

While soap operas gained economic legitimacy over time (due to profit-earning potential) and were popular with audiences, they were never widely classified as an “art” form. Through examination of 3 aspects of The New York Times articles—tone of critical commentary, viewership of critical commentary, and themes of critical commentary—we explore the role of evaluative press coverage in the validation, or lack thereof, of the soap opera form.

While the racism and sexism of the tweet drew fire, the tweet was also hotly defended by comedians who insisted that it functioned to “expand the boundaries of comedy.” In this essay, the tweet is analyzed as a “discourse knot” to interrogate the intersections of comedic discourse and the construction of Black girlhood in U.S. culture. The study's 2 key findings are that first, purportedly “edgy” comedy can function to sustain social power hierarchies, and second, Black girlhood constitutes an unintelligible subject position in the Foucauldian sense, necessitating rigorous attention, especially with regard to issues of cultural sexualization. © 2015 International Communication Association","Black Girls; Comedy; Intersectionality; Quvenzhané Wallis; Sexualization; The Onion",,,,,,,,"(2007) Report of the APA Task Force on the sexualization of girls, , www.apa.org/pi/wpo/sexualization.htm, Washington, DC, American Psychological Association, Retrieved from; Ariès, P., (1973) Centuries of childhood, , Harmondsworth, England, Penguin; Bercovici, J., (2013) The Onion, apologizes?, , http://www.forbes.com/sites/jeffbercovici/2013/02/26/the-onion-apologizes-youve-got-to-be-joking/, February 26)., ou've got to be joking., Forbes, [Blog post].

In 1978, the U.S. Congress launched a retaliatory attack on the FTC; failing to renew the FTC's funding, it shut down the agency for the first and only time in U.S. history. The kidvid crusade is a lens through which to understand the broader political and economic shift toward neoliberalism in the coming years and, indeed, portended the rise of deregulation and new forms of corporate public relations in the political sphere. © 2015 International Communication Association","Action for Children's Television; Advertising Policy; Children's Advertising; Federal Trade Commission; Hegemony; Kidvid; Media Activism; Neoliberalism; Postwar Media Policy; U.S. Media Policy History",,,,,,,,"Abernathy, A., Frank, G.R., FTC regulatory activity and the information content of advertising (1998) Journal of Public Policy & Marketing, 17, pp. 239-256. , #x0026; (1977) Annual report 1977, , (Carton 1, Box 1).

Obama's stories of exemplary assimilated immigrants foreground values such as entrepreneurialism, responsibility, and neoliberal multiculturalism. These stories idealize certain forms of subjectivity and regulate the inclusive and exclusive dimensions of citizenship. Through the logic of neoliberal exception, Obama argues that American identity is both open to all who strive for it and also limited to the “right” kinds of immigrants. Critically analyzing President Obama's celebrated immigration rhetoric, particularly in light of his administration's restrictive immigration policies, can contribute to studies of race, citizenship, and immigration in the neoliberal era. © 2015 International Communication Association","Barack Obama; Immigration; Multiculturalism; Neoliberalism; Presidential Rhetoric; Race",,,,,,,,"Ahmed, S., (2008), http://www.darkmatter101.org/site/2008/02/19/'liberal-multiculturalism-is-the-hegemony---its-an-empirical-fact'-a-response-to-slavoj-zizek/, . “Liberal multiculturalism is the hegemony—Its [sic] an empirical fact”—A response to Slavoj Žižek., Darkmatter, Retrieved from; Ahmed, S., (2010) The Promise of Happiness, , Durham, NC, Duke University Press; Amaya, H., Latino immigrants in the American discourses of citizenship and nationalism during the Iraqi war (2007) Critical Discourse Studies, 4, pp. 237-256; Anguiano, C.A., Chávez, K.R., DREAMers' discourse: Young Latino/a immigrants and the naturalization of the American dream (2011) Latina/o discourse in vernacular spaces: Somos de una voz?, pp. 81-100. , #x0026;, In, M.

As such, the article pays attention to the methods, tools, and practices used to construct Nasrallah's mediated persona and Nasrallah's role in self-mediation processes.

Beyond the conventional conceptualization of policing as repression, I argue for a broader definition of policing to include a process of producing counternarratives and gaining active consent from citizens. With this conceptualization, this study shows that the powerful can use new media as a way of producing “legitimate” narratives and controlling contentious discourses, invoking familiar social norms and ideas at the level of micropractices of citizenship. In particular, this case study focuses on the role of nationalism, nationalistic citizenship, and geopolitical ideologies circulated in the media in producing counternarratives against the protest. © 2015 International Communication Association","Activism Media; Global Communications; New media/Social Movement",,,,,,,,"(2010), http://www.vop.co.kr/view.php?cid=A00000335748, Voice of Public, Retrieved from; Bae, J.S., (2010) Arrest warrant for drawing rat on G20 promotion poster?, , http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/2010/11/117_75731.html, The Korea Times, Retrieved from; Bennett, L., New media power: The internet and global activism (2003) Contesting media power: Alternative media in a networked world, pp. 17-38. , In, N.

The promotional culture surrounding the blockbuster movie event, including the attention devoted to celebrity actors and directors, attracts media audiences, while the movie itself may stimulate sociocultural debate on film esthetics, art, celebrity culture, and the cultural industries. Taking our point of departure in mediatization theory, we analyze the interwoven communicative forms of the film industry and the printed press. We exemplify our arguments with the coverage in Danish newspapers of 3 blockbusters, representing different points in time in the more recent history of film and news media. © 2015 International Communication Association","Blockbusters; Celebrities; Cultural Journalism; Film Industry; Mediatization; Press Coverage; Public Relations (PR)",,,,,,,,"Altheide, D., Snow, R.P., (1979) Media logic, , #x0026;, Beverly Hills, CA, SAG; Baumann, S., Intellectualization and art world development: Film in the United States (2001) American Sociological Review, 66 (3), pp. 404-426; Boatwright, P., Basuroy, S., Kamakura, W., Reviewing the reviewers: The impact of individual film critics on box office performance (2007) Quantitative Marketing and Economics, 5, pp. 401-425. , #x0026; Boorstin, D., (1961) The image: A guide to pseudo-events in America, , New York, NY, Harper Colopho; Bourdieu, P., (1984) Distinction: A social critique of the judgement of taste, , London, England, Routledg; Couldry, N., Mediatization or mediation?

Focusing on female celebrities allows us to consider how women's interests become articulated in the construction of development donors in an increasingly privatized development landscape. Emerging through the global production of television, music, and film, Oprah, Madonna, and Angelina Jolie have used their wealth and status to contribute to global philanthropy. Following a discussion of their resources, analyses connect their articulated missions in development as well as public discourse about their projects to underlying frameworks of social change, recognizing the role of patriarchy in neoliberal logics that guide mainstream global development.

Angered by the Code's prohibition of the so-called astrological programs, viewers mobilized and wrote letters of protest to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) in 1953. Taken as a whole, the letters demonstrate viewers' confusion about—but wholesale belief in—the FCC's role in regulating television, and they reveal viewers' discursive construction of this fledgling genre. Rather than analyzing the prohibition of astrological programs as a self-regulatory maneuver or as a cultural moment, this article highlights the intersection of industrial self-regulation, government regulatory power, and viewer feedback. © 2014 International Communication Association","Astrology; Broadcasting (Television); Genre; Media History; Public Understanding of Media Regulation; Regulation; Television Audiences; Television Code",,,,,,,,"Adorno, T.W., (1994) The stars down to Earth and other essays on the irrational in culture, , New York, NY, Routledg; Anderson, A., (1953), April 27).

A movement for Roma rights has emerged and solidified since the 1990s, marked by the fall of Communism in Eastern Europe, rising neo-fascist anti-Roma discrimination, European Union enlargement, immigration policies, and moral panics. Based on in-depth longitudinal and historical analyses, this study explains the discourse of victimization as constructed in nongovernmental organizations' (NGOs) communication materials. I suggest here that a vehement position against anti-Roma discrimination is rather self-explanatory in post-World War II and post-Communist Europe; but I also critique the role that NGO communication plays within structures that maintain an anti-Roma system in place—by overly victimizing the Roma peoples. © 2014 International Communication Association","Advocacy Communication; Ethnicity; NGO; Rights; Roma/Gypsy; Victimization",,,,,,,,"al Yafai, F., (2005) I swore on my grandparents' grave I'd work for the Roma., , http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storyCode=199260&sectioncode=26, The Times Higher Education, Retrieved fro; Bancroft, A., (2005) Roma and gypsy-travellers in Europe: Modernity, race, space and exclusion, , Burlington, VT, Ashgat; Barany, Z., (2002) The East European gypsies: Regime change, marginality, and ethnopolitics, , New York, NY, Cambridge University Pres; Bhabha, H., Of mimicry and man: The ambivalence of colonial discourse (1984) October, 28, pp. 125-133; Bhabha, H., (1994) The location of culture, , London, England, Routledg; Blasco, P.G.Y., Gypsy/Roma diasporas.

To evaluate this relationship, the study focuses on the specific media strategies feminists developed to respond to the high-profile O. J.

ROPT corresponds to societies of control, where power exploits new “freedoms” to participate/produce/express (as well as consume/diffuse/evaluate). These developments further correspond to postpolitics/postdemocracy, where issues, discourses, and agency for sociopolitical change remain constrained, despite the enabling of a new range of cultural and pseudopolitical participation around, among other things, truth.

Does it express the economic impact of the industry, the political influence of particular “media moguls,” or the media's capacity to modify attitudes and beliefs? Does it refer to the ability of media to provide state or corporate actors with a valuable tool to assert their own dominance or to the diffusion of symbolic resources? Are we to believe that the media are increasingly the locus of power or that they constitute the space where power is decided?

The ethnographic techniques of participant observation and interviews with these sports television news gatherers provide an in-depth look at the increasingly complex work facing sports journalists in this specific area of the sports–media complex. The study's findings reveal that women and African American sports television reporters working at this RSN said they are treated differently—even to an advantage—because of their gender and race.

As a participant observer, I illustrate that the way those at the movement's General Assembly engaged in issue discussions and decision-making followed the procedural ideals of deliberation and deliberative democracy to a certain extent. With innovative rhetorical and discussion mechanisms, deliberation at the assembly countered common criticisms against deliberation that it is impractical and causes polarization in political attitudes. I further argue that the overall Occupy movement was an example of communicative action in the weak public sphere and it served as a place of developing citizenship, which contributed to the theory of deliberative democracy in many meaningful ways. © 2014 International Communication Association","Deliberation; Deliberative Democracy; Occupy Wall Street; Participatory Democracy; Political Participation; Social Movement",,,,,,,,"Barge, J.K., Enlarging the meaning of group deliberation: From discussion to dialogue (2002) New directions in group communication, pp. 159-178. , In, L.

Drawing upon an extensive case analysis of the “trick shot” enterprise known as Dude Perfect, we illustrate how even the most homespun forms of mediation are thrust into the imperatives of neoliberal accumulation whereby the “homemade” cyber-spatial media-sport production becomes aligned with, if not overdetermined by, the processes of corporatization, spectacularization, and marketization. © 2014 International Communication Association","Corporatization; Hyperreality; Spectacle; Sport; Trick Shots",,,,,,,,"Andrews, D.L., Excavating Michael Jordan: Notes on a critical pedagogy of sporting representation (1998) Sport and postmodern times, pp. 185-220. , In, G.

The study presents a typology of these skits indicating an evolutionary development: from the use of humor to criticize Holocaust remembrance to the use of Holocaust memory to create humorous effects. Contextualizing these findings in the fields of media memory and trauma theory, the study argues that this evolutionary development challenges the hegemonic commemorative discourse of the Holocaust: while commemorative discourse plays a distinctive role in performing cultural trauma, the media's humorous discourse conveys a sacrilegious viewpoint and thus can play a vital role in recuperating from it. © 2014 International Communication Association","Collective Memory; Cultural Trauma; Holocaust Commemoration; Humor; Television Skits",,,,,,,,"Alexander, C.J., Towards a theory of cultural trauma (2004) Cultural trauma, pp. 1-28. , In, C.
