Doubt about the extent to which others are ill is a common and consequential form of partner uncertainty that we focus on in this study. Guided by Goldsmith’s (2001, 2004, 2016) normative framework, we analyzed data from interviews with 32 individuals (M age = 35.28, SD = 9.91; 72% female), uncovering how participants struggled to manage their doubt of family members’ health and to respond in normatively supportive ways to family members’ health claims. Each uncertainty management strategy for seeking and avoiding information, obtaining social support, and adjusting to chronic doubt often risked valued identities and relationships. This study illuminates the underrepresented perspective of individuals who doubt family members’ health issues and the challenges they face as support providers. © 2020, © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Afifi, T.D., Merrill, A.F., Davis, S., The theory of resilience and relational load (2016) Personal Relationships, 23 (4), pp. 663-683; Afifi, W.A., Guerrero, L.K., Motivations underlying topic avoidance in close relationships (2000) Balancing the secrets of private disclosures, pp. 165-180. , Petronio S., (ed), Mahwah, NJ: Erlbaum, &,.

Despite the existence of this growing population that diversifies U.S. family values, communication scholars have long neglected same-sex households in their research agenda. In this qualitative study, we deploy queer theory to expose and call into question the cultural binary between homosexuality and heterosexuality in determining what is viewed as a good and/or culturally acceptable family, through the voices of gay adoptive parents. These voices aim to present how same-sex parents challenge and interrogate normative family discourses and parenting practices. The findings of twenty in-depth interviews identified two interrelated themes. The first theme, queering heteronormative family imagery, unpacks how participants problematize certain heteronormative ideologies that reinforce the traditional concept of family through everyday communication. The second, queering dominant parenting practices, delineates the discursive and material realities of the parenting culture at the intersection of gender, sexuality, class and age. In all, participants’ voices in this study offer a sense of queer intervention in destabilizing taken-for-granted assumptions on how to do family, and further explore (re)constructions and (re)imaginings of what a socially just family could be. © 2020, © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Tennessee governor says he will sign anti-LGBT adoption bill (2020) New York Times, , https://www.nytimes.com/, January, 14, Retrieved from; Baker, B.M.A., “We’re just family, you know?” Exploring the discourses of family in gay parents’ relational talk (2019) Journal of Family Communication, 19 (3), pp. 213-227; Baxter, L.A., (2014) Remaking “family” communicatively, , New York, NY: Peter Lang; Berkowitz, D., Theorizing lesbian and gay parenting: Past, present and future scholarship (2009) Journal of Family Theory and Review, 1, pp. 117-132; Berkowitz, D., “It was the Cadillac of adoption agencies:” Intersections of social class, race, and sexuality in gay men’s adoption (2011) Journal of GLBT Family Studies, 7, pp. 109-131; Berkowitz, D., Maternal instincts, biological clocks, and soccer moms: Gay men’s parenting and family narratives (2012) Symbolic Interaction, 34, pp. 514-535; Chevrette, R., Outing heteronormativity in interpersonal and family communication: Feminist applications of queer theory “beyond the sexy streets” (2013) Communication Theory, 23 (2), pp. 170-190; Coontz, S., (2016) The way we never were: American families and the nostalgia trap, , 2nd, New York, NY: Basic Books, ed; Crouch, S., Waters, E., McNair, R., Power, J., Davis, E., van Mourik, L., Triumphs and challenges in recruiting same-sex parent families (2014) Australian and New Zealand Journal of Public Health, 38 (1), pp. 87-88; Crouch, S.R., McNair, R., Waters, E., Parent perspective on child health and wellbeing in same-sex families: Heteronormative conflict and resilience building (2017) Journal of Child Family Studies, 26 (8), pp. 2202-2214; (2017) LGBTQ families: Who are we and what our families look like?, , https://www2.census.gov/cac/nac/meetings/2017-11/LGBTQ-families-factsheet, Retrieved from; Finch, J., Displaying families (2007) Sociology, 41 (1), pp. 65-81; Foster, E., Commitment, communication, and contending with heteronormativity: An invitation to greater reflexivity in interpersonal research (2008) Southern Communication Journal, 73 (1), pp. 84-101; Galvin, K.M., Diversity’s impact on defining the family: Discourse dependence and identity (2006) The family communication sourcebook, pp. 3-19. , West R., Turner L.H., (eds), Thousand Oaks, CA: SAGE,.

Through the lens of communication privacy management theory (CPM), the present student explores how birth mothers who participated in closed adoptions experienced turbulence related to wanting to still be included in the privacy boundary of their children in a range of ways that were inconsistent with the legal parameters of a closed adoption. Participants (n = 31) responded to an online questionnaire asking about privacy issues and expectations related to their adoption information, specifically their experiences of turbulence. Emergent themes included inaccurate notions about perceived shared co-ownership rights, regret about the limited primary control of adoption information, and a desire for turbulence, allowing further expansion of co-ownership and control. Results of this study show how birth mothers who have engaged in closed adoptions may come to regret signing over control of their children (and consequently all privacy management decisions) to adoption agencies. These women appreciate the cultural and legal shifts that have created turbulence, opening up adoption records in some states, enabling them to potentially co-own more information about their children. Implications of these findings demonstrate birth mothers’ privacy rules evolve over time. © 2020, © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,"The authors would like to thank the Editor and the anonymous reviewers for their time, effort, continued support, and substantial and insightful feedback on this manuscript.

But a different set of relational dynamics may be at play in preexisting acrimonious partnerships. In this article, we investigate the use of different modes of communication by high-conflict separated parents (media multiplexity), and map changes in modes of communication (modality switching). Qualitative data from 68 separated parents in Australia who reported chronic parental acrimony suggest that a considerable amount of modality switching occurred post-separation. Consistent with MMT, multiplexity was evident but the degree of multiplexity was not as clearly related with the degree of closeness in the co-parental relationship as would be otherwise predicted by MMT. Recent insights into more pernicious forms of family dynamics set an important challenge for communication theories to better account for ex-couple motivational complexities. © 2020, © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,"Australian Research Council, ARC: FF110100757",This work was supported by an Australian Research Council grant [No. FF110100757] awarded to Smyth.,,"Amato, P.R., Previti, D., People’s reasons for divorcing: Gender, social class, the life course, and adjustment (2003) Journal of Family Issues, 24, pp. 602-626; (2011) Parenting communication resources in high-conflict cases: Summit project 2011, , Arizona: AFCC,.

Interviews with 22 mothers addressed the following questions: What emotions characterize the mother-child relationship in the eczema context? What, if any, behaviors do mothers identify as communicating children’s emotions about the eczema experience? What specific coping behaviors and types do mothers use with their child in the eczema context? Findings reveal that mothers most commonly report experiencing anxiety, despair, shame, and compassion, while their children demonstrate externalizing and internalizing behaviors consistent with anger, anxiety, and depression. Coping behaviors include normalization, differentiation, and control, which reflect coping types described in the communal coping model. Theoretical implications address connections between emotion, coping, and resilience. Practical implications highlight areas of attention for mothers and professionals. © 2020, © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,"The author offers her sincere thanks to Jessica Jiang and Carly Hanna, two outstanding undergraduate research assistants who compassionately engaged with the eczema community.",,"Afifi, T.D., Hutchinson, S., Krouse, S., Toward a theoretical model of communal coping in postdivorce families and other naturally occurring groups (2006) Communication Theory, 16 (3), pp. 378-409; Basinger, E.D., Explicating the appraisal dimension of the communal coping model (2018) Health Communication, 33 (6), pp. 690-699; Caicedo, C., Families with special needs children: Family health, functioning, and care burden (2014) Journal of the American Psychiatric Nurses Association, 20 (6), pp. 398-407; Capozza, K., Gadd, H., Kelley, K., Russell, S., Shi, V., Schwartz, A., Insights from caregivers on the impact of pediatric atopic dermatitis on families: “I’m tired, overwhelmed, and feel like I’m failing as a mother (2020) Dermatitis.

Specifically, we sought to illuminate the ways parents characterize and construct the identities of their children when speaking to third parties and identify the types of stories parents tell. Based on theoretical sampling and a narrative adaption of the constant comparison method, we analyzed 60 stories children remember their parents telling about them. This resulted in four identity impression types (prodigal child, special child, party pooper, and child of misfortune) and four story functions (to tease, to express pride, to rebuke, and to entertain).

One type of conversation employs invitational rhetoric, which describes communication where the goal is not to persuade, but to exchange perspectives by creating an atmosphere that establishes safety, value, and freedom. Up to now invitational rhetoric has been used to understand public communication from a rhetorical perspective, but we apply this theory to family communication. To understand invitational rhetoric in families, participants (N = 113) completed a qualitative questionnaire about communication with their parents. Using the critical incident technique participants provided a detailed narrative about a time that they and a parent had a successful conversation about a difficult topic. The results provide a blueprint for understanding what young adults perceive as contributing to invitational conversations with their parents. © 2020, © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Afifi, T., Afifi, W., Merrill, A.F., Denes, A., Davis, S., “You need to stop talking about this!”: Verbal rumination and the costs of social support (2013) Human Communication Research, 39, pp. 395-421; Alexander, B.K., Hammers, M., An invitation to rhetoric: A generative dialogue on performance, possibility, and feminist potentialities in invitational rhetoric (2017) Cultural Studies: Critical Methodologies, 19, pp. 5-14; Arnett, J.J., Understanding the new way of coming of age (2006) Emerging adults in America: Coming of age in the 21st century, , Arnett J., Tanner J., (eds), Washington, DC: American Psychological Association,. 3–19, (Eds; Bates, B.R., Participatory graffiti as invitational rhetoric: The case of O Machismo (2017) Qualitative Research Reports in Communication, 18, pp. 64-72; Baxter, L.A., A tale of two voices: Relational dialectics theory (2004) Journal of Family Communication, 4, pp. 181-192; Baym, N.K., Zhang, Y.B., Lin, M.C., Social interactions across media: Interpersonal communication on the internet, telephone and face-to-face (2004) New Media & Society, 6, pp. 299-318; Beyers, W., Goossens, L., Emotional autonomy, psychosocial adjustment and parenting: Interactions, moderating and mediating effects (1999) Journal of Adolescence, 22, pp. 753-769; Bone, J.E., Griffin, C.L., Scholz, T.M.L., Beyond traditional conceptualizations of rhetoric: Invitational rhetoric and a move toward civility (2008) Western Journal of Communication, 72, pp. 434-462; Butterfield, L.D., Borgen, W.A., Amundson, N.E., Maglio, A.S.T., Fifty years of the critical incident technique: 1954–2004 and beyond (2005) Qualitative Research, 5, pp. 475-497; Caughlin, J.P., Malis, R.S., Demand/withdraw communication between parents and adolescents: Connections with self-esteem and substance use (2004) Journal of Social and Personal Relationships, 21, pp. 125-148; Coakley, C.G., Wolvin, A.D., Listening in the parent-teen relationship (1997) International Journal of Listening, 11, pp. 88-126; Cole, D.A., McPherson, A.E., Relation of family subsystems to adolescent depression: Implementing a new family assessment strategy (1993) Journal of Family Psychology, 7, pp. 119-133; Daft, R.L., Lengel, R.H., Organizational information requirements, media richness and structural design (1986) Management Science; Linthicum, 32, pp. 554-571; Dale, K., Burrell, G., (2007) The spaces of organisation and the organisation of space: Power, identity and materiality at work, , Basingstoke, UK: Palgrave; Edwards, A.P., Graham, E.E., The relationship between individuals’ definitions of family and implicit personal theories of communication (2009) Journal of Family Communication, 9, pp. 191-208; Flannery, D.J., Montemayor, R., Eberly, M., Torquati, J., Unraveling the ties that bind: Affective expression and perceived conflict in parent adolescent interactions (1993) Journal of Social and Personal Relationships, 10, pp. 495-509; Foss, S., Griffin, C., Beyond persuasion: A proposal for an invitational rhetoric (1995) Communication Monographs, 62, pp. 1-18; Foss, S.K., Griffin, C., The metatheoretical foundations of invitational rhetoric: Axiological, epistemological, and ontological explorations Inviting understanding: A portrait of invitational rhetoric, , in press,Foss S., Griffin C., (eds), Lanham, MD: Rowman & Littlefield, &,.

They extend the theory by reporting unanticipated practices, such as truth-telling and having fun. TRRL was challenged to account for the roles played by culture, faith, and resource-intensive identities.

The present study explores the types of advice mothers provide underage college students about drinking. A random sample of college students (ages 18 to 20) completed an online survey about their alcohol use and conversations they had with their mother about alcohol. Students’ perceptions of mother-child harm-reduction conversations include the themes of: specific protective behavioral strategies, ambiguous behavioral advice, decision making advice, value-based advice, warning-based advice, and advice conveying approval. Discussion of specific protective behavioral strategies was most common for female students and students who reported binge drinking. Mothers did not typically address how to implement harm-reduction strategies effectively.

The present study aims to examine positive family communication as a facilitator of family adaptation to divorce, its impact on children’s maladjustment, and the role of coparenting. A cross-sectional study was carried out with 309 parents with high interparental-conflict. The expected model was tested using path analysis. We observed that: 1) positive family communication was related to parents’ greater psychological adjustment to the divorce and fewer socioeconomic consequences of the divorce on children and indirectly to children’s lower anxiety/depression and aggressiveness; 2) supportive coparenting was a protective factor against socioeconomic consequences, but a risk factor in situations of high conflict. These results highlight positive family communication in family adaptation and children’s well-being. Furthermore, findings differentiate the divorce conditions in which coparenting may or may not be appropriate. © 2020, © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,"Ministerio de Ciencia, InnovaciÃ³n y Universidades, MCIU: PSI2015-67983-R","This research was supported by the Ministry of Science, Innovation and Universities (Government of Spain) under Grant [PSI2015-67983-R].",,"Achenbach, T.M., (1991) Manual for the child behavior checklist (4–18) and 1991 profile, , Burlington: University of Vermont, Department of Psychiatry; Afifi, T.D., Huber, F.N., Ohs, J., Parents’ and adolescents’ communication with each other about divorce-related stressors and its impact on their ability to cope positively with the divorce (2006) Journal of Divorce & Remarriage, 45 (1-2), pp. 1-30; Amato, P.R., Research on divorce: Continuing trends and new developments (2010) Journal of Marriage and Family, 72 (3), pp. 650-666; Amato, P.R., The consequences of divorce for adults and children: An update (2014) Drustvena Istrazivanja, 23 (1), pp. 5-24; Barnes, H.L., Olson, D.H., Parent-adolescent communication scale (1982) Family inventories: Inventories used in a national survey of families across the family life cycle, pp. 51-63. , Olson D.H., McCubbin H., Barnes H.L., Larsen A., Muxen M., Wilson M., (eds), St. Paul: University of Minnesota, &,.

Despite the explanatory breadth of this general theory, however, researchers have yet to empirically test whether or not family communication patterns (FCPs) are transmitted from one generation to the next. In this study, we sought to advance FCPT by testing the intergenerational transmission of FCPs across two generations of family. Participants included 188 grandparent-parent-grandchild triads from the southern region of the United States. Results indicated that grandparent conversation and conformity orientations predict both parent and grandchild conversation and conformity orientations. Consistent with the intergenerational transmission of FCPs, indirect effects of grandparent FCPs emerged for the grandchild’s FCPs through the parent’s FCPs. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Afifi, T.D., Olson, L., The chilling effect in families and the pressure to conceal secrets (2005) Communication Monographs, 72, pp. 192-216; Bakhtin, M.M., Author and hero in aesthetic activity (1990) Art and answerability: Early essays by M.

This study explored self-reported maintenance behaviors and perceptions of barriers that hinder feelings of connectedness for non-incarcerated women who have a relational partner in jail. Responses from an open-ended questionnaire of 124 non-incarcerated women with relational partners in jail were analyzed to highlight issues of long-distance relational maintenance. Results from an inductive exploratory analysis yielded twelve maintenance behaviors and seven perceived barriers that the women in this study perceive factor into relational maintenance with an incarcerated partner. I organize the relational maintenance strategies in this context by intrapersonal, dyadic, and network-level behaviors. Openness, assurances, and future planning were reported as frequent behaviors utilized by non-incarcerated women to maintain connectedness with an incarcerated partner. These women also identified a lack of intimacy and communication as barriers to relational maintenance with an incarcerated partner. Findings indicate a strong parallel in maintenance behaviors enacted by women with deployed spouses and the women of incarcerated partners. In this context, the restrictions of prison policy and stigma affects the women of incarcerated partners from exploring network involvement as a way to stay connected to an incarcerated relational partner. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Apel, R., Blokland, A.A.J., Nieuwbeerta, P., van Schellen, M., The impact of imprisonment on marriage and divorce: A risk set matching approach (2010) Journal of Quantitative Criminology, 26, pp. 269-300; Austin, J., Hardyman, P.L., The risks and needs of returning prisoner population (2004) Review of Policy Research, 21, pp. 13-29; Bales, W., Mears, D., Inmate social ties and the transition to society: Does visitation reduce recidivism?

After viewing a description of a target mother, who portrayed one of seven empirically-derived mother stereotypes, participant mothers (N = 529) reported on their intended attitudes, positive and negative emotions, and facilitative and harmful behaviors toward another mother. Results revealed the ambivalent effects of stereotypes on mothers’ intergroup and interpersonal dynamics. Specifically, the content of the ideal and lazy stereotypes elicited mothers’ contempt, whereas mothers’ SAHM and WM group identities influenced both positive and negative responses to the stereotypes that embody intensive mothering (e.g., ideal, overworked, family and home oriented).

Participants included 223 young adult children who reported on the frequencies with which they engaged in surface acting and deep acting with their mother and father. Whereas conversation orientation inversely predicted surface acting and deep acting with both parents, conformity orientation positively predicted surface acting with mother and moderated the inverse associations between conversation orientation and surface acting with both parents. Bootstrapping analyses revealed significant indirect effects for conversation orientation on young adults’ mental well-being through surface acting with both parents. Conversely, there were indirect effects for conformity orientation on mental well-being only through surface and deep acting with mother. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Ashforth, B.E., Humphrey, R.H., Emotional labor in service roles: The influence of identity (1993) Academy of Management Review, 18, pp. 88-115; Baumrind, D., Current patterns of parental authority (1971) Developmental Psychology Monograph, 4, pp. 1-102; Caughlin, J.P., Malis, R.S., Demand/withdraw communication between parents and adolescents: Connections with self-esteem and substance use (2004) Journal of Social & Personal Relationships, 21, pp. 125-148; Cohen, J., Cohen, P., West, S.G., Aiken, L.S., (2003) Applied multiple regression/correlation analysis for the behavioral sciences, , 3rd, Mahwah, NJ: Erlbaum, &, ed; Cohen, S., Kamarck, T., Mermelstein, R., A global measure of perceived stress (1983) Journal of Health and Social Behavior, 24, pp. 385-396; Diefendorff, J.M., Gosserand, R.H., Understanding the emotional labor process: A control theory perspective (2003) Journal of Organizational Behavior, 24, pp. 945-959; Dornbusch, S.M., Mont-Reynaud, R., Ritter, P.L., Chen, Z., Steinberg, L., Stressful events and their correlates among adolescents of diverse backgrounds (1991) Adolescent stress: Causes and consequences, pp. 111-130. , Colten M., Gore S., (eds), New York, NY: Aldine De Gruyter, &,.

An online survey asked parents (N = 311) to evaluate their marital relationship experiences surrounding a period of change during their child’s life. Analyses, which focused on participants who reported a major life event (N = 235), identified 11 categories of transitions. Across the transitions, perceptions of a partner’s engagement in transition processing communication was negatively associated with partner uncertainty and interference from a partner, and positively associated with facilitation from a partner. In contrast to the hypotheses, participants’ own engagement in transition processing communication was positively associated with partner uncertainty.

Consequently, twins occupy a liminal cultural space where the spectacle of their relationship is praised and the intimacy of their relationship is often denigrated. To explore how individual twins navigate this double-bind, we adopted a cultural approach to examine the communicative constitution of intimacy in twin relationships (or twinships). Thirty-one twins participated in individual interviews about their relationship with their co-twin. Participant interviews indicated that twins make sense of their intimacy on a continuum of high and low levels of twintimacy, or intimacy of twin relationships characterized by individual and cultural constructions of twinships as extraordinary. Our findings revealed that twintimacy is both similar to and different from intimacy in singleton relationships. We discuss theoretical and practical implications of these results. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Aron, A., McLaughlin-Volpe, T., Including others in the self: Extensions to own and partner’s group memberships (2001) Individual self, relational self, and collective self: Partners, opponents, or strangers, pp. 89-108. , Brewer M., Sedikides C., (eds), Mahwah, NJ: Erlbaum, &,.

Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 30 adult adoptees who had made contact with a birth parent. Two primary discourses emerged. The discourse of parent as a specific person (DPSP) emerged when participants felt that parent referred exclusively to their adoptive parents; the definition did not change when participants made contact with their birth parent. The discourse of parent as a label (DPL) emerged when participants defined parent as a flexible role that could be filled by multiple people; their definition of parent changed only after making contact with their birth parent, and they included their birth parent in their definition of parent. These discourses demonstrated interplay through negating, countering, and entertaining.

CPT was also positively related to parents’ individual and relational well-being, demonstrating the benefits of LGBT children taking the perspective of their parent when coming out. Findings suggest an extension of CNSM theory’s second proposition, sharpen the conceptualization of narrative resilience, and highlight the important role of CPT to sense-making and individual and relational well-being. © 2020, © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Adams, T.E., (2011) Narrating the closet an autoethnography of same-sex attraction, , Walnut Creek, CA: Left Coast Press; Afifi, T.D., Merrill, A.F., Davis, S., The theory of resilience and relational load (TRRL) (2016) Personal Relationships, 23, pp. 663-683; Braithwaite, D.O., Allen, J., Moore, J., (2017) Data conferencing.

Moreover, research has highlighted the value of examining contextual variables that may influence ethnic-racial socialization behaviors. With a backdrop of the racially charged 2016 United States (U.S.) presidential election campaign, national survey data from White, Black, and Hispanic parents of children ages 6 to 17 were merged with geographic race data. Findings reveal that characteristics of parents (including partisanship) and children (especially age), as well as dyadic characteristics of the parent–child (e.g., general talk frequency and campaign-related talk) and of the geographic context (i.e., county racial composition) affect the frequency of parent–child racism talk. Many predictors vary in their importance by parent ethnicity-race. For instance, White parents talk about racism less, and Black parents more, when Whites numerically dominate the county in which they reside. © 2020, © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Abramowitz, A.I., (2018) The great alignment: Race, party transformation, and the rise of Donald Trump, , New Haven, CT: Yale University Press; Askelson, N.M., Campo, S., Smith, S., Mother-daughter communication about sex: The influence of authoritative parenting style (2012) Journal of Health Communication, 27, pp. 429-448; (2015) Why do US police keep killing unarmed black men?, , http://www.bbc.com/, May, 26, Retrieved from; Boulianne, S., Stimulating or reinforcing political interest: Using panel data to examine reciprocal effects between news media and political interest (2011) Political Communication, 28, pp. 147-162; Brody, G.H., Flor, D.L., Maternal resources, parenting practice, and child competence in rural, single-parent African American families (1998) Child Development, 69, pp. 803-816; Bronfenbrenner, U., Toward an experimental ecology of human development (1977) American Psychologist, 32, pp. 513-531; Bronfenbrenner, U., Ecology of the family as a context for human development: Research perspectives (1986) Developmental Psychology, 22, pp. 723-742; Brown, G., How to talk about racism with your white parents (2020) Rewire, , https://www.rewire.org/, June, 11,.

One underexplored area of this relationship is how adult daughters construct and perform the daughtering role. The present study explores how daughters talk about the ways they enact daughtering and evaluate their role in a social world. The findings reveal how daughters position themselves within a family system and, more broadly, in society. This paper includes interview data with 33 adult daughters about their mothers. We illuminate more about how daughters, as role players, conceive of the expectations for their roles and evaluate their role performance in light of role expectations. Analysis revealed four role expectations tied to good daughtering: showing respect, providing protection, eliciting mothering, and making time for connection. Our analysis supports that daughters assess themselves based on their understanding of these role expectations. We present a matrix to illustrate these findings. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Alford, A.M., Daughtering and daughterhood: Adult daughters in communication with their mothers (2019) Constructing motherhood and daughterhood across the lifespan, pp. 15-36. , New York, NY: Peter Lang,.

This study examined parental restrictive and active mediation of teenagers’ social media use as potential predictors of these outcomes. We were particularly interested in understanding whether parental agreement about media rules and the consistency with which mediation was implemented had implications for teens’ social media use, conflict with parents, and experience with online relational aggression. We conducted an online survey of 814 adolescents from the United States (14- to17-year-olds), asking about perceived agreement between parents about media rules, parental mediation styles, the teens’ social media use, and their experiences with online relational aggression. Results showed that parental rule agreement negatively predicted inconsistent parental mediation. Inconsistent parental mediation predicted more adolescent social media use and more parent-teen conflict over media rules, which in turn, predicted both online victimization and perpetration. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,"Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation, WARF",Funding for this project came in part from an award to the second author from the Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation.,,"(2016) Parents, teens, and digital monitoring, , http://www.pewresearch.org, Retrieved from Pew Research Center website; (2018) A majority of teens have experienced some form of cyberbullying, , http://www.pewresearch.org, Retrieved from Pew Research Center website; Barry, T.D., Dunlap, S.T., Lochman, J.E., Wells, K.C., Inconsistent discipline as a mediator between maternal distress and aggression in boys (2009) Child & Family Behavior Therapy, 31, pp. 1-19; Baumrind, D., The influence of parenting style on adolescent competence and substance abuse (1991) Journal of Early Adolescence, 11, pp. 56-95; Bleakley, A., Ellithorpe, M., Romer, D., The role of parents in problematic internet use among US adolescents (2016) Media and Communication, 4, p. 24; Block, J.H., Block, J., Morrison, A., Parental agreement-disagreement on child-rearing orientations and gender-related personality correlates in children (1981) Child Development, 52, pp. 965-974; Bronfenbrenner, U., (1979) The ecology of human development, , Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press; (2017) Bullying and Internet Safety are Top Health Concerns for Parents, , https://mottpoll.org/sites/default/files/documents/082117_TopParentConcerns.pdf, Retrieved from University of Michigan, C.S.

The study investigated the adoptive parent’s and family identities through six interviews with the adoptive mother, adoptees’ behavioral adjustment reported by the mother, two unstructured observations, and exploration of adoptees’ narratives. The study was guided by a narrative-based framework situated with the cultural socialization approach. Results highlight four central themes: 1) becoming Chinese-Americans; 2) meaning related to adoption is both spoken and unspoken; 3) a we-ness identity, and 4) social-cultural contexts of identity work. Findings demonstrate the incorporation of adoption and the adoptees’ race and culture into the adoptive parent’s and family identities. Findings further illuminate that one’s identity is developed within personal, familial, and social-cultural contexts. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Achenbach, T.M., Rescorla, L.A., (2001) Manual for the ASEBA school-age forms & profiles: An integrated system of multi-informant assessment, , Burlington: University of Vermont; Colaner, C.W., Halliwell, D., Guignon, P., “What do you say to your mother when your mother’s standing beside you?” Birth and adoptive family contributions to adoptive identity via relational identity and relational–Relational identity gaps (2014) Communication Monographs, 4, pp. 469-494; Colaner, C.W., Kranstuber, H., “Forever kind of wondering”: Communicatively managing uncertainty in adoptive families (2010) Journal of Family Communication, 10, pp. 236-255; Docan-Morgan, S., “They don’t know what it’s like to be in my shoes”: Topic avoidance about race in transracially adoptive families (2010) Journal of Social and Personal Relationships, 28, pp. 336-355; Dorow, S.K., (2006) Transnational adoption: A cultural economy of race, gender and kinship, , New York: New York University Press; Dunbar, N., Grotevant, H.D., Adoption narratives: The construction of adoptive identity during adolescence (2004) Family stories and the life course: Across time and generations, pp. 135-161. , Pratt M., Fiese B., (eds), Mahwah, NJ: Erlbaum, &,.

Specifically, we analyzed how the narrative theme, sequence, and similarity related to spouses’ perceived stress and relational satisfaction. Heterosexual married couples (n = 185; N = 370) who had experienced a miscarriage responded to online questionnaires in which they told the story of their pregnancy loss and completed measures of well-being. Seven miscarriage story themes emerged–hope lost, factual, time heals, helpful support, unhelpful support, cautiously optimistic, and guilt/shame. Findings demonstrated that husbands’ themes accounted for differences in their relational satisfaction, whereas wives’ themes accounted for differences in their perceived stress. Analyses on narrative similarity revealed couples with different themes reported higher relational satisfaction than those with similar themes. Further, those couples with the same narrative sequences (i.e., contaminated, redemptive, or ambivalent) reported less perceived stress than those with different narrative sequences. These findings suggest that storying miscarriage helps both husbands and wives process loss in unique ways. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,This work was supported by the University of Missouri?s Richard Wallace Faculty Incentive Grant.,,"(2017) Miscarriage: Signs, symptoms, treatment and prevention, , http://americanpregnancy.org/pregnancy-complications/miscarriage/, Retrieved from; Bochner, A.P., Ellis, C., Tillman-Healy, L.M., Relationships as stories (1997) Handbook of personal relationships: Theory, research and interventions, pp. 307-324. , Duck S., (ed), 2nd, New York, NY: Wiley, &,.

While parents are often seen as the site of this socialization, we wanted to explore which racial socialization messages were salient for young adults, and from whom they received these messages. This paper utilized focus groups to explore messages that young Black adults received about race, and what this means for their racial identity. We identified three dominant themes in our analyses: (a) the content of familial messages regarding race, identity, and prejudice, (b) critical incidents that shaped individuals’ understandings of Black racial identity, and (c) familial sources. Each of these themes is constituted by various experiences and examples that shed light on racial socialization in today’s social climate. Overall, parents, extended family members, and community members were sources of socializing what race meant to young Black adults. We discuss implications for research on racial socialization and family communication. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Arnett, J.J., (2004) Emerging adulthood: The winding road from the late teens through the twenties, , Oxford: Oxford Univ.

William and Mary Diederich College of Communication, Marquette University, United States","The influx of Central American families fleeing gang violence in the countries of El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras has captured the attention of the government, citizens, and the media and has created a crisis of its own leading to strong rhetoric and policy changes from the current U.S. administration led by Donald Trump. This study conducts a textual analysis of 35 stories published by The New York Times about the Central American migrant crisis between January of 2016 and mid-May of 2019 and identifies four categories of content: New kinds of migrants at the U.S. border, the Central American migrant crisis, the Trump administration’s approach to the crisis, and critique of Trump policy. Sub-categories were also developed for three of these categories. The findings indicate that there has been a shift in the type of migrant who tries to cross the border or seek asylum in the United States. Instead of undocumented single men migrants at the U.S.-Mexico border, there are now Central American migrant families displaced by the gang violence in Central America. The stories analyzed in this study highlight the changes to U.S. border and immigration policy partly in response to changes in migration patterns caused by this crisis. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Ahmed, A., Dickerson, C., Migrant caravan puts Mexico back in U.S. cross hairs (2018) The New York Times, , http://www.nytimes.com, October, 22, Retrieved from; Ahmed, A., Jordan, M., Malkin, E., Mexico protests U.S. decision to return asylum seekers (2019) The New York Times, , http://www.nytimes.com, January, 25, Retrieved from; Avecedo, N., Why are migrant children dying in U.S. custody?

Hybrid thematic analysis, combining FCTP with inductive analysis, was used to analyze 21 semi-structured interviews with grandparents. Results yielded four themes describing grandparents’ reported communicative practices: creating opportunities for listening and dialogue, talking about emotion, emphasizing openness, and allowing questioning; and three themes describing the impact of second-chance parenting: increased resources, acquired wisdom, and matured emotionally.

Bronfenbrenner’s bio-ecological perspective served as a guiding framework, based on its ability to consider family interactions across ecological contexts, both proximal and distal to the developing child’s home setting. Fifty incarcerated mothers in the central U.S. provided in-depth interviews and individual self-report surveys. Findings indicate that incarcerated mothers most frequently used an authoritative parenting communication style in conflict situations that ended positively, and authoritarian style in conflict that ended negatively. Authoritative parenting was associated with incarcerated mothers’ reports of greater satisfaction with parenting. Study findings suggest that parenting communication style can help support efforts to reduce recidivism. Contextualizing these findings within Bronfenbrenner’s model, the present study affirms the role of proximal as well as distal factors governing relational communication between incarcerated mothers and their children. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,0210-0317-10,This study was partially funded by the Cleveland State University Office of Research Faculty Research Development (FRD) Grant #0210-0317-10.,,"Ade-Ridder, L., Jones, A.R., Home is where the hell is: An introduction to violence against children from a communication perspective (1996) Family violence from a communication perspective, pp. 59-84. , Cahn D.D., Lloyd S.A., (eds), Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage Publications, &,.

Brokering can be stressful for low-income, Latino adolescents, who are already at-risk for depression. We tested the theory of resilience and relational load (TRRL) in a new context (in 100 low-income, Latino mother-adolescent dyads who engaged in language brokering) and extended TRRL by proposing security- and threat-based behaviors and appraisals can be represented by interaction goals. We examined mother warmth, mother brokering interaction goals of supporting and monitoring the adolescent, adolescent brokering feelings, and adolescent depressive symptoms. Mothers’ support goal was a protective factor against adolescent depression, but only when adolescents also inferred mothers pursued this goal. Adolescent positive brokering feelings were also a protective factor, as when positive feelings were high, the positive association between negative feelings and depression was not present. Findings supported TRRL propositions about relational maintenance, security-based goals, emotional reserves, and mental health. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Afifi, T., Granger, D., Ersig, A., Tsalikian, E., Shahnazi, A., Davis, S., Scranton, A., Testing the theory of resilience and relational load (TRRL) in families with type I diabetes (2018) Health Communication, pp. 1-13. , Advanced online publication; Afifi, T.D., Individual/relational resilience (2018) Journal of Applied Communication Research, 46, pp. 5-9; Afifi, T.D., Merrill, A., Davis, S., The theory of resilience and relational load (TRRL) (2016) Personal Relationships, 23, pp. 663-683; Allgaier, A.K., Fruhe, B., Pietsch, K., Saravo, B., Baethmann, M., Schulte-Korne, G., Is the children’s depression inventory short version a valid screening tool in pediatric care?

This study explores the support processes that IRPs engage in with those who are often the source of external pressures on the romantic unit–family members. The study examines IRPs’ support expectations from family and how this shapes the support and resilience of the IRP over time. In-depth interviews were conducted with 32 IRPs and 30 parents of IRPs, resulting in a grounded theory of participants’ support expectations and their violations and ensuing experiences of support and/or strain. Based on their support expectations, participants came across three support paths after initiating support-seeking disclosure strategies. Encounters with these support paths resulted in support and strain for IRPs and their parents. Taken together, the results contribute to theorizing about processes of support and their functionality in underrepresented relationships. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Afifi, T., Steuber, K., The revelation risk model (RRM): Factors that predict the revelation of secrets and the strategies used to reveal them (2009) Communication Monographs, 76, pp. 144-176; Afifi, T.D., ‘Feeling caught’ in stepfamilies: Managing boundary turbulence through appropriate communication privacy rules (2003) Journal of Social and Personal Relationships, 20 (6), pp. 729-755; Afifi, T.D., Individual/relational resilience (2018) Journal of Applied Communication Research, 46, pp. 5-9; Afifi, T.D., McManus, T., Steuber, K.R., Coho, A., Verbal avoidance and dissatisfaction in intimate conflict situations (2009) Human Communication Research, 35, pp. 357-383; Afifi, T.D., Merrill, A.F., Davis, S., The theory of resilience and relational load (2016) Personal Relationships, 23, pp. 663-683; Afifi, T.D., Steuber, K., The cycle of concealment model (2010) Journal of Social and Personal Relationships, 27, pp. 1019-1034; Afifi, W.A., Burgoon, J.K., The impact of violations on uncertainty and the consequences for attractiveness (2000) Human Communication Research, 26, pp. 203-233; Bell, G.C., Hastings, S.O., Black and white interracial couples: Managing relational disapproval through facework (2011) Howard Journal of Communications, 22, pp. 240-259; Bell, G.C., Hastings, S.O., Exploring parental approval and disapproval for black and white interracial couples (2015) Journal of Social Issues, 71, pp. 755-771; Blumer, H., What is wrong with social theory?

Framed relational dialectics theory–this study explored the meaning(s) of family and fatherhood in married gay fathers’ relational talk. I interviewed 13 married gay parent dyads and conducted follow-up interviews to collect data across time as well as member check initial results. Using contrapuntal analysis, I identified the discourses of traditional family structure and nontraditional family structure at play. I argue that the couples’ talk reflected discursive struggles to generate relational meanings for their family identities. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Baxter, L.A., (2011) Voicing relationships: A dialogic perspective, , Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage; Baxter, L.A., Introduction to the volume (2014) Remaking “family” communicatively, pp. 3-16. , Baxter L.A., (ed), New York, NY: Peter Lang,.

Their unequal circulation is the focus of our study. Using relational dialectics theory, we sought to identify dominant and marginalized discourses evoked by new mothers who are dissatisfied with their transition to motherhood. Twenty women with a first child under the age of two years old shared their experiences during semi-structured interviews. These mothers’ talk reflects a variant on dominant discourses of motherhood–the Discourse of Motherhood as Innately Desired (DMID) where wanting to be, as well as looking like, a “good” mother are subthemes. However, the Discourse of Motherhood as Learned (DML) served as a counterpoint for sense-making that offers space for alternative, albeit marginalized, understandings of motherhood where it is not assumed as the primary goal for women nor a natural extension of their womanhood. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Afiyanti, Y., Solberg, S.M., “It is my destiny as a woman”: On becoming a new mother in Indonesia (2015) Journal of Transcultural Nursing, 26, pp. 491-498; Andrews, M., Introduction: Counter-narratives and the power to oppose (2002) Narrative Inquiry, 12, pp. 1-6; Arendell, T., Conceiving and investigating motherhood: The decade’s scholarship (2000) Journal of Marriage and Family, 62, pp. 1192-1207; Bamberg, M., Considering counter narratives (2004) Considering counter narratives: Narrating, resisting, making sense, pp. 351-371. , Bamberg M.W., Andrews M., (eds), Amsterdam, The Netherlands: John Benjamins,.

As social networking sites for mothers (SNSM) present an environmental influence on the family system, a mother’s experience with social comparison, belonging, and emotion on SNSM can bear significant influence over her satisfaction with her parenting. The present study utilized survey methods to explore mothers’ (n= 336) reported experiences of these variables. We use structural equation modeling to specify a model with good fit, which indicated that greater downward comparison directly related to greater parenting satisfaction, with belonging and negative emotion as mediating indirect relationships. Implications for family communication and mothers’ SNSM practices are discussed. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,"The authors offer sincere thanks to the three reviewers who have significantly improved this manuscript, to Pepperdine University’s internal grant support for faculty scholarship, and to our wonderful undergraduate research assistants, Annelise Green, Daisy Jauregui, and Emma Johnson.",,"Abetz, J., Moore, J., “Welcome to the mommy wars, ladies”: Making sense of the ideology of combative mothering in mommy blogs (2018) Communication Culture and Critique, 11, pp. 265-281; Allan, S., Gilbert, P., A social comparison scale: Psychometric properties and relationship to psychopathology (1995) Personality and Individual Differences, 19 (3), pp. 293-299; Baumeister, R.F., Leary, M.R., The need to belong: The desire for interpersonal attachments as a fundamental human motivation (1995) Psychological Bulletin, 117, pp. 497-529; Belsky, J., Spanier, G.B., Rovine, M., Stability and change in marriage across the transition to parenthood (1983) Journal of Marriage and the Family, 45, pp. 567-577; Bleidorn, W., Buyukcan-Tetik, A., Schwaba, T., Van Scheppingen, M.A., Denissen, J.J., Finkenauer, C., Stability and change in self-esteem during the transition to parenthood (2016) Social Psychological and Personality Science, 7 (6), pp. 560-569; Chae, J., “Am I a better mother than you?”: Media and 21st-century motherhood in the context of the social comparison theory (2015) Communication Research, 42 (4), pp. 503-525; Chalken, C., Anderson, H., Mothering on Facebook: Exploring the privacy/openness paradox (2017) Social Media + Society, pp. 1-10; Chou, H.T.G., Edge, N., “They are happier and having better lives than I am”: The impact of using Facebook on perceptions of others’ lives (2012) Cyberpsychology, Behavior, and Social Networking, 15 (2), pp. 117-121; Cohen, J.H., Raymond, J.M., How the internet is giving birth (to) a new social order (2011) Information, Communication & Society, 14 (6), pp. 937-957; Corcoran, K., Crusius, J., Mussweiler, T., Social comparison: Motives, standards, and mechanisms (2011) Theories in social psychology, pp. 119-139. , Chadee D., (ed), Oxford, UK: Wiley-Blackwell, &,.

Public health initiatives have focused on improving FHH communication. Research indicates that tools remain largely unused in non-clinical settings and people tend to refrain from engaging in FHH communication. Research also indicates that cultural and family relationship factors influence FHH communication and tool use. This study investigated FHH tools as resources for FHH communication within Caucasian, Hispanic, and Pacific Islander families. Interviews with 10 family dyads from each racial/ethnic group included opportunities for participants to evaluate two FHH tools. Using structurating activity theory, the qualitative analysis revealed that participants viewed the tools as a structure for FHH information, a guide for how to communicate about FHH, and a source for stories about family health. Results are discussed in terms of how family system elements and social structures shape perceptions and use of FHH tools.

Interviews with 26 women with vulvodynia illuminate core tenets of the critical interpersonal and family communication (CIFC) framework, which include power; private and public sphere bidirectionality; the critique, resistance, and transformation of the status quo; and considerations of author reflexivity. As the author is herself a heterosexual woman navigating vulvodynia, reflexivity is particularly salient. Status quo social constructs are explicated. Results demonstrate how participants experience losses of relational power and problematic media depictions establishing standards for “normal” heterosexual sex. Discourses and practices concerning the perpetuation, resistance, and potential transformation of the status quo are described. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,"University of South Florida, USF","The author would like to thank Dr. Steven Wilson, Professor at the University of South Florida and Dr. Maria Venetis, Associate Professor at Purdue University for their comments on earlier versions of this manuscript and for shaping the thesis project on which this manuscript is based.",,"Ayling, K., Ussher, J.M., “If sex hurts, am I still a woman?” The subjective experience of vulvodynia in hetero-sexual women (2008) Archives of Sexual Behavior, 37, pp. 294-304; Baxter, L.A., Braithwaite, D.O., Relational dialectics theory: Crafting meaning from competing discourses (2008) Engaging theories in interpersonal communication: Multiple perspectives, pp. 349-361. , Braithwaite D.O., Baxter L.A., (eds), Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage, &,.

For families grieving the death of a family member, this process often takes place through family storytelling while individuals simultaneously move through their own unique bereavement experience. Teens face difficulty in this process, as the context of their lives and the pressure to act a particular way for others often leaves them feeling disconnected and voiceless. In this ethnographic project, I served as a teen camp counselor at a family bereavement camp where teens relied upon aesthetic, embodied narrative experiences to communicate amid these difficulties. Specifically, these narrative resources enabled teens to acknowledge the value of their perspectives and re-engage in life in affirming ways, reject confining scripts for “appropriate” grief and co-create new ones that felt true to their journeys, and re-integrate themselves into their family storytelling practices with an affective voice in which they had recognized legitimacy and gained confidence. Findings suggest the capacity of these narrative resources to connect individuals in meaningful ways and foster resilience in family storytelling following the significant disruptions that the death of a loved one imposes. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Andrews, M., (2014) Narrative imagination and everyday life, , Oxford: Oxford University Press; Atkinson, P., Coffey, A., Revisiting the relationship between participant observation and interviewing (2003) Postmodern interviewing, pp. 109-122. , Gubrium J.F., Holstein J.A., (eds), Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage, &,.

Adult children’s (N = 182) self-reported silent-treatment behaviors were negatively related to their own self-esteem, and the satisfaction they reported for their primary parent was negatively related to that parent’s silent treatment. The parent’s admitting displeasure, however, was positively related to this satisfaction and positively associated with the child’s feelings of control. Revealed sex differences were minor and outside of gendered expectations for communicating disappointment. In testing parent socialization of the silent treatment, parent silent-treatment use was positively associated with the adult child’s silent-treatment use, with no demonstrated mediation by parent identification. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Amato, P.R., Marital conflict, the parent-child relationship and child self-esteem (1986) Family Relations, 35, pp. 403-410; Amato, P.R., Father-child relations, mother-child relations, and offspring psychological well-being in early adulthood (1994) Journal of Marriage and the Family, 56, pp. 1031-1042; Aron, A., Aron, E.N., Smollan, D., Inclusion of other in the self scale and the structure of interpersonal closeness (1992) Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 63, pp. 596-612; Atchley, R.C., A continuity theory of normal aging (1989) The Gerontologist, 29, pp. 183-190; Brook, J.S., Whiteman, M., Gordon, A.S., Brook, D.W., Father–Daughter identification and its impact on her personality and drug use (1986) Developmental Psychology, 22, pp. 743-748; Buss, D.M., Manipulation in close relationships: Five personality factors in interactional context (1992) Journal of Personality, 60, pp. 477-499; Caughlin, J.P., Family communication standards: What counts as excellent family communication and how are such standards associated with family satisfaction?

In transnational families separated by national boarders, family members may face constraints on channel selection due to cultural and/or structural factors. We draw from media multiplexity theory (MMT) and the cultural dimensions model to examine how transnationalism, societal individualism-collectivism (I-C), family allocentrism, and relational closeness influence the use of information communication technologies (ICTs) to maintain long-distance family relationships (LDFRs). Whereas results of the analysis provide cross-cultural support for MMT’s predictions regarding closeness and ICT frequency, the analysis reveals little support for MMT’s predictions regarding closeness and ICT variety. This study extends MMT by including culture in the study of relational closeness and ICT use, highlights the importance of family allocentrism when applying MMT to LDFRs, and demonstrates how transnational families can have frequent communication to maintain close, long-distance ties despite limited channel variety.

In this study, we examined how parents’ negative relational disclosures about their children to each other serve as mediators of coparental communication and relational quality in divorced (n = 65 dyads) and married couples (n = 173 dyads). Coparents’ reports of closeness and satisfaction in both couple types were predicted primarily by their reports of supportive and antagonistic coparental communication. The results also revealed significant indirect effects of supportive coparental communication on closeness through negative relational disclosures about young adult children for married mothers and divorced fathers. Antagonistic coparental communication positively predicted married coparents’ disclosures about their children, but not divorced coparents’ disclosures. The results extend theoretical models of coparenting and provide implications for coparenting education programs. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Adamsons, K., Pasley, K., Coparenting following divorce and relationship dissolution (2006) Handbook of divorce and relationship dissolution, pp. 241-261. , Fine M.A., Harvey J.H., (eds), Mahwah, NJ: Erlbaum, &,.

Based on identity implications theory and the normative model of social support, common themes regarding how families might pursue task, relational, and identity goals were expected (RQ1). Based on their unique positions, we investigated whether the three groups stressed different themes (RQ2). Military parents (n = 51), partners (n = 74), and Veterans (n = 112) read a scenario in which a SM was having difficulty reintegrating after deployment; all three groups offered advice about how military families should handle similar situations. Common themes regarding task, relational, and identity goals emerged in the advice from all three groups; however, parents, partners, and Veterans also differed significantly in how often they mentioned six themes.

Contrapuntal analysis of 36 online narratives revealed 2 discourses competing to make meaning of the parent–child relationship. The discourse of inseparable connection (DIC) drew upon themes of unconditional love, biology, and permanent role identification, constructing parents and children as forever connected; the discourse of effortful transactions (DET) manifested through themes of reciprocal respect and positive emotions, work and support exchanges, and physical and emotional boundary negotiation.

Treating perceptions of elderly care receiver’s under-accommodative behaviors (i.e., communication problems, painful self-disclosure, and patronizing talk) as moderators, relationships between family caregiver’s characteristics and forms of elder abuse/neglect were examined. Adult family caregivers (N = 220) were surveyed. The results suggested partial support of the proposed model. Caregivers’ perceptions of their elderly care receivers’ under-accommodation significantly moderated the relationships between different caregiver characteristics and all three forms of abuse. Discussion focused on the theoretical contribution of the findings, and the potential influence of the three under-accommodative behaviors in the family caregiving context. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Acierno, R., Hernandez-Tejada, M., Muzzy, W., Steve, K., (2009) National elder mistreatment study, , http://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/nij/grants/226456.pdf, U.S. Department of Justice, Retrieved from, &, Washington, DC; American’s growing elderly population, , http://ncea.acl.gov/whatwedo/research/statistics.html#population, Retrieved from; (2013) DSM-5 self-rated level 2 cross-cutting symptom measure for adult–The substance section, , Rockville, MD: National Institute on Drug Abuse; (2013) PROMIS emotional distress–depression–short form level 2 for adult, , Evanston, IL: PROMIS Health Organization; Amstadter, A.B., Cisler, J.M., McCauley, J.L., Hernandez, M.B., Muzzy, W., Acierno, R., Do incident and perpetrator characteristics of elder mistreatment differ by gender of the victim?

The results of a cross-sectional survey (N = 475; Mage = 14.6) indicated that autonomy-supportive restrictive mediation was positively related to prosocial behavior through increased prosocial media exposure, while it was also associated with less antisocial behavior through decreased antisocial media content exposure. Autonomy-supportive active mediation on the other hand strengthened the positive association between exposure to prosocial media content and the performance of prosocial behavior. However, this type of mediation did not moderate the association between exposure to antisocial media content and the performance of antisocial behavior. These results indicate that autonomy-supportive mediation styles are most effective in managing media effects, but that antisocial media content may warrant a more restrictive approach. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,The authors would like to thank Tessa Claes and Arne Caluw? for their assistance in collecting the data used in this study.,,"Austin, E.W., Pinkleton, B.E., Fujioka, Y., The role of interpretation processes and parental discussion in the media’s effects on adolescents’ use of alcohol (2000) Pediatrics, 105, pp. 343-349; Beyens, I., Beullens, K., Parent–Child conflict about children’s tablet use: The role of parental mediation (2017) New Media & Society, 19, pp. 2075-2093; Björkqvist, K., Lagerspetz, K.M.J., Kaukiainen, A., Do girls manipulate and boys fight?

In-depth interviews with migrant workers and participant observations of family reunions in rural China reveal that both celebratory and non-celebratory family activities are ritualized. In particular, the study suggests that the Spring Festival family reunion has transformed into a meta-ritual comprised of five categories of ritual activities: festival rituals, reunion rituals, patterned interactions, reunions with friends, and communal rituals. These rituals constitute both the internal and external identities of migrant families, but may also remind them of the traumatic reality of family separation or trigger hidden tensions within the family. Implications for studying family communication in times of mobility and family diversity are discussed. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Akkoor, C., “Is he my real uncle?”: Re-constructing family in the diaspora (2014) Remaking “family” communicatively, pp. 229-244. , Baxter L.A., (ed), New York, NY: Peter Lang,.

From a perspective grounded in the communicative dynamics of musical engagement, this effect was hypothesized to be mediated by perceptions of interpersonal coordination and empathy between parent and child. Support was found for such mediated effects, particularly with coordination as a mediator. Results persisted when controlling for other forms of positive parent–child activity, thus illustrating the specific relational power of musical engagement, and more generally the importance of attending to what parents and children are doing when they interact. © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Arnett, J.J., (2004) Emerging adulthood: The winding road from the late teens through the twenties, , New York, NY: Oxford University Press; Aron, A., Aron, E.N., Smollan, D., Inclusion of other in the self scale and the structure of interpersonal closeness (1992) Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 63, pp. 596-612; Barnes, H., Olson, D., Parent-adolescent communication and the circumplex model (1985) Child Development, 56, pp. 438-447; Bayley, A., Ethnographic research into contemporary string quartet rehearsal (2011) Ethnomusicology Forum, 20, pp. 385-411; Baym, N.K., Zhang, Y.B., Kunkel, A., Ledbetter, A., Lin, M., Relational quality and media use in interpersonal relationships (2007) New Media & Society, 9, pp. 735-752; Berndt, T.J., Developmental changes in conformity to peers and parents (1979) Developmental Psychology, 15, pp. 608-616; Bonneville-Roussy, A., Rentfrow, P.J., Xu, M.K., Potter, J., Music through the ages: Trends in musical engagement and preferences from adolescence through middle adulthood (2013) Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 105, pp. 703-717; Brenick, A., Romano, K., Perceived peer and parent outgroup norms, cultural identity, and adolescents’ reasoning about peer intergroup exclusion (2016) Child Development, 87, pp. 1392-1408; Brumariu, L.E., Kerns, K.A., Parent-child attachment in early and middle childhood (2011) The Wiley-Blackwell handbook of childhood social development, , Smith P.K., Hart C.H., (eds), 2nd, Oxford, UK: Blackwell Publishers, &,.

It is reasonable to surmise that caregivers encounter privacy coordination issues when attempting to care for their aging parent. This study utilizes Communication Privacy Management theory to explore what content is considered private and what privacy coordination issues arise in the context of eldercare. Results from 27 in-depth interviews with adult children caring for an aging parent suggest that information concerning parents’ future care, health and well-being, and (in)capabilities were marked private. The findings also detail three disruptions to privacy coordination, including parental caregivers’ ambivalence toward managing parents’ care-related information. Critical implications of the study are discussed, which include how privacy turbulence may be a functional catalyst for boundary recalibration. © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,"University of Missouri, MU",This research was supported in part from the Verser Graduate Student Support Fund at the University of Missouri.,,"Bromley, M.C., Blieszner, R., Planning for long-term care: Filial behavior and relationship quality of adult children with independent parents (1997) Family Relations, 46, pp. 155-162; Charmaz, K., (2006) Constructing grounded theory: A practical guide through qualitative analysis, , Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage; Child, J.T., Petronio, S., Privacy management matters in digital family communication (2015) Family communication in the age of digital and social media, pp. 32-45. , Bruess C.J., (ed), New York, NY: Peter Lang, &,.

This topic is salient in the context of young adults attending college, as this developmental stage necessitates independent decision-making and adjustment on the part of these students. At the same time, the turbulence involved in this transition might engender parental interference and facilitation that could impact young adults’ adjustment and perceived family functioning. This study used structural equation modeling to examine overparenting, perceived interference, facilitation, student adjustment, and family functioning in 302 parent–young adult dyads. Results indicated that overparenting was associated with facilitation, but not interference. Whereas this association was negative for young adults, it was positive for parents. This pattern was also reflected in the indirect effects of overparenting on student adjustment through young adults’ versus parents’ perceived facilitation. Young adults appear to have better outcomes when they perceive their parents to be facilitating their goals. © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Aquilino, W.S., Family relationships and support systems in emerging adulthood (2006) Emerging adults in America: Coming of age in the 21st century, pp. 193-217. , Arnett J.J., (ed), Washington, DC: APA Books,.

However, understanding the ways in which divorce disclosures impact young adults is paramount in promoting healthy family communication. A greater comprehension of these impacts can help families process through difficult conversations and understand disclosures’ influence on individuals’ mental and emotional health. Guided by the divorce disclosure model (Afifi, Schrodt, & McManus, 2009b), the current study included 419 young adult (i.e, aged 18–30) participants who completed an online questionnaire, including a newly developed communicative emotion management measure. Through structural equation modeling, results indicated that cognitive reappraisal and feeling caught mediate the relationship between divorce disclosures and emotion regulation strategies and that this association is contingent upon young adults’ mental health. Implications are discussed, and suggestions for family research and practitioner guidance are offered. © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Afifi, T.D., ‘Feeling caught’ in stepfamilies: Managing boundary turbulence through appropriate communication privacy rules (2003) Journal of Social and Personal Relationships, 20, pp. 729-755; Afifi, T.D., Afifi, W.A., Coho, A., Adolescents’ physiological reactions to their parents’ negative disclosures about the other parent in divorced and nondivorced families (2009) Journal of Divorce & Remarriage, 50, pp. 517-540; Afifi, T.D., McManus, T., Divorce disclosures and adolescents’ physical and mental health and parental relationship quality (2010) Journal of Divorce & Remarriage, 51, pp. 83-107; Afifi, T.D., McManus, T., Hutchinson, S., Baker, B., Inappropriate parental divorce disclosures, the factors that prompt them, and their impact on parents’ and adolescents’ well-being (2007) Communication Monographs, 74, pp. 78-102; Afifi, T.D., Schrodt, P., Feeling caught” as a mediator of adolescents’ and young adults’ avoidance and satisfaction with their parents in divorced and non-divorced households (2003) Communication Monographs, 70, pp. 142-173; Afifi, T.D., Schrodt, P., McManus, T., The divorce disclosure model (DDM): Why parents disclose negative information about the divorce to their children and its effects (2009) Uncertainty, information management, and disclosure decisions: Theories and applications, pp. 403-425. , Afifi T.D., Afifi W., (eds), New York: Routledge, &,.

Data were collected from 110 (N = 330) mother–father–child triads. The results showed significant links between father-child reports of persecuted feelings (i.e., belief that others intentionally provoke conflict) and stress reactions (i.e., psychological reaction) during conflict. There were also significant links between mother–child reports of positive and negative relational effect (i.e., belief that conflict benefits/damages relationships). Adult children’s reports of four of the six TCP dimensions were associated with their depressive symptoms and anxiety, and the results showed significant indirect effects from parent TCP to adult child verbal aggression, constructive conflict, depressive symptoms, and anxiety. © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Aloia, L.S., Solomon, D.H., Conflict intensity, family history, and physiological stress reactions to conflict within romantic relationships (2015) Human Communication Research, 41, pp. 367-389; Amato, P.R., Explaining the intergenerational transmission of divorce (1996) Journal of Marriage and the Family, 58, pp. 628-640; Bandura, A., (1977) Social learning theory, , Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice Hall; Baucom, B.R., Eldridge, K.A., Marital communication (2013) The Routledge handbook of family communication, pp. 65-79. , Vangelisti A., (ed), New York, NY: Routledge, &,.

Response threshold represents the point at which a negative stimulus produced by an unperformed task is of sufficient intensity to compel an individual to attend to it. One hundred and fifty-five heterosexual marital dyads (mean length of marriage = 19.98 years) completed an online questionnaire about their household labor conflict and response thresholds. Response thresholds were assessed using a photograph-based measure, and data were analyzed via an actor-partner interdependence model. Consistent with theoretical predictions, a significant actor-threshold-by-partner-threshold-by-sex interaction predicted reported demand/withdraw in domestic labor conflict. Individuals with low or mean response thresholds reported more self-demand/partner-withdraw the higher their partner’s response threshold, and this effect was more pronounced among women than men. © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,"This research was supported in part by grants from the Hugh Downs School of Human Communication at Arizona State University.

These women negotiate their own and their children’s childbearing identities. Using performative face theory, a critical poststructural interpersonal and family communication theory of identity and difference, this study analyzed intergenerational shifts in parent–child communication between families-of-origin (when participants were children) and families-of-creation (when participants were parents). Most participants described how their parents articulated either pronatalist face threats or antinatalist face support, which constrained possibilities for their childbearing identities. Participants, however, stressed that they have talked or plan to talk to their own children in a different, more neutral-natalist way by sharing their stories, emphasizing childbearing agency, and quietly desiring grandchildren. Negotiations of childbearing face are therefore informed by—and in turn sustain, resist, or sometimes subvert—discursive articulations of power/knowledge that circulate throughout culture about (never) having children. © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,"American Association of University Women, AAUW","This research was supported by an American Dissertation Fellowship awarded by the American Association of University Women.

Siblings also have indicated that the loss of a baby in their family enriched their lives despite their pain. The present study extends this work by focusing not only on siblings but also other children enmeshed in the family system. Additionally, we heed the call for the use of arts-based methods in family communication by performing a visual narrative analysis of children’s baby loss remembrance drawings. This analysis of 131 drawings completed by children ages zero to 18 yielded three main themes, including narration of identity, narration of life and death, and narration of growing sense-making. Two continua capture these themes, including the subject of narrativization and the mode of narrativization. In presenting these findings, we provide a unique (means of) understanding children’s experience of baby loss in the family. © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Avelin, P., Gyllenswärd, G., Erlandsson, K., Rådestad, I., Adolescents’ experiences of having a stillborn half-sibling (2014) Death Studies, 38, pp. 557-562; Basinger, E.D., Wehrman, E.C., McAninch, K.G., Grief communication and privacy rules: Examining the communication of individuals bereaved by the death of a family member (2016) Journal of Family Communication, 16, pp. 285-302; Braithwaite, D.O., Allen, J., Moore, J., Data conferencing (2017) The international encyclopedia of communication research methods, , Matthes J.P., Davis C.S., Potter R.F., (eds), Hoboken, NJ: Wiley-Blackwell, &,.

Engaging a relational turning points perspective, 38 stepchildren (males and females, ages 25 to 52 years old) who reported a positive stepparent relationship were interviewed, generating 269 turning points which were categorized into 15 turning point types and coded by valence. Turning points occurring most frequently were: prosocial actions, quality time, conflict/disagreement, changes in household/family composition, and rituals.

Specifically, we examined how adoptive parents’ understandings of their child’s race and culture changed after adopting transracially and how adoptive parents navigated racial and cultural differences through talk. Results from 21 interviews revealed that adoptive parents reported an increased awareness of race and culture, such that a new appreciation for their child’s race and culture developed yet simultaneously amplified ambivalence. Results further indicated parents utilized narrating, naming, ritualizing, discussing, normalizing, and praising to communicatively negotiate racial and cultural identity differences. Findings contribute to transracial adoptive family research by illuminating how parents make sense of differing social identities within the family. Results also advance discourse-dependence theorizing by demonstrating the context-specific nature of internal boundary management strategies and by giving voice to the prevalence of border work in transracial adoptive families. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Anderson, K.N., Rueter, M.A., Lee, R.M., Discussions about racial and ethnic differences in internationally adoptive families: Links with family engagement, warmth, & control (2015) Journal of Family Communication, 15, pp. 289-308; Baxter, L.A., Babbie, E., (2004) The basics of communication research, , Belmont, CA: Wadsworth; Braun, V., Clarke, V., Using thematic analysis in psychology (2006) Qualitative Research in Psychology, 3, pp. 77-101; Brian, K., (2012) Reframing transracial adoption: Adopted Koreans, White parents, and the politics of kinship, , Philadelphia, PA: Temple University Press; Creswell, J.W., (2007) Qualitative inquiry and research design: Choosing among five approaches, , Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage; De Haymes, M.V., Simon, S., Transracial adoption: Families identify issues and needed support services (2003) Child Welfare, 82, pp. 251-272; Docan-Morgan, S., They don’t know what it’s like to be in my shoes”: Topic avoidance about race in transracially adoptive families (2011) Journal of Social and Personal Relationships, 27, pp. 336-355; Ferrari, L., Rosnati, R., Manzi, C., Benet-Martínez, V., Ethnic identity, bicultural identity integration, and psychological well-being among transracial adoptees: A longitudinal study (2015) New Directions for Child and Adolescent Development, 150, pp. 63-76; Gaertner, S.L., Dovidio, J.F., (2000) Reducing intergroup bias: The common ingroup identity model, , Philadelphia, PA: Psychology Press; Galvin, K., International and transracial adoption: A communication research agenda (2003) Journal of Family Communication, 3, pp. 237-253; Galvin, K., Diversity’s impact on defining the family (2006) The family communication sourcebook, pp. 3-19. , Turner L.H., West R., (eds), Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage,.

Utilizing three waves of longitudinal survey data from 393 Latina/o 6th–8th grade students, we tested the hypotheses using a random intercept cross-lagged panel model, which partitions variance at the between-person and within-person levels over time. At the between-person level, we found that, relative to the sample averages, as Latina/o students reported higher levels of parental hope communication, they tended to report higher levels of constructive conflict over the academic year. At the within-person level, parental hope communication at one time point positively predicted constructive parent-adolescent conflict at the next time point. Our findings inform hope theory, family communication, and positive communication research by demonstrating the potential utility of parental hope communication for increasing constructive conflict in parent-adolescent relationships. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Abraído-Lanza, A.F., Viladrich, A., Flórez, K.R., Céspedes, A., Aguirre, A.N., De La Cruz, A.A., Commentary: Fatalismo reconsidered: A cautionary note for health-related research and practice with Latino populations (2007) Ethnicity & Disease, 17, pp. 153-158; Ackerman, R.A., Kashy, D.A., Conger, R.D., Donnellan, M.B., Positive-engagement behaviors in observed family interactions: A social relations perspective (2011) Journal of Family Psychology, 25, pp. 719-730; Bámaca-Colbert, M.Y., Umaña-Taylor, A.J., Gayles, J.G., A developmental-contextual model of depressive symptoms in Mexican-origin female adolescents (2012) Developmental Psychology, 48, pp. 406-421; Barge, J.K., Hope, communication, and community building (2003) Southern Communication Journal, 69, pp. 63-81; Basáñez, T., Warren, M.T., Crano, W.D., Unger, J.B., Perceptions of intragroup rejection and coping strategies: Malleable factors affecting Hispanic adolescents’ emotional and academic outcomes (2014) Journal of Youth and Adolescence, 43, pp. 1266-1280; Berry, D., Willoughby, M.T., On the practical interpretability of cross-lagged panel models: Rethinking a developmental workhorse (2016) Child Development.

We examined how individuals communicate in online forums about relational uncertainty in military life using a grounded theory approach to analyze 1,794 pages of threads. Results demonstrated that posters detected deception and/or recognized change, which led to volatile emotions, and ultimately prompted them to seek help for managing relational uncertainty. Posters dealt with their questions by engaging in self-care, justifying the partner’s behavior, postponing action, and doing relationship work. In reply, responders provided emotional support by offering comfort and reframing change. They provided informational support by recommending that posters acknowledge deception, take care of themselves, consider the partner’s perspective, defer major changes, and work on the relationship. These findings advance theorizing about relational uncertainty and social support; they also suggest guidelines for helping military couples manage relational uncertainty. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Afifi, W.A., Uncertainty and information management in interpersonal contexts (2010) New directions in interpersonal communication research, , Smith S.W., Wilson S.R., (eds), Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage,.

This study extends existing research by positioning resilience as an interpersonal process in which people communicatively interpret and respond to adversity. Married participants who experienced significant adversity in their family of origin (n = 193) reported on their familial and marital communication and personal characteristics. Overall, resilience was influenced by the unique and combined influences of individual, marital, and family factors. Individuals’ optimism and efficacy emerged as predictors of resilience, and communicated support from a marital partner was particularly important for those lower in optimism. People from families with a balance of cohesion and flexibility and strong communication were more resilient, regardless of the amount of adversity they experienced.

In particular, the study examines 28 interviews of Asian women engineers to explore the ways in which cultural meanings of engineering careers influence families’ messages towards girls in choosing their future careers. Contrapuntal analysis shows that competing culturally circulating discourses intersect with familial material/discursive resources through which girls make sense of the support and barriers they experience from parents and other family members regarding their engineering careers. Findings have considerable implications for the role of culture in familial understanding of engineering careers and how families contribute towards sustaining young women in engineering from an Asian perspective. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,Purdue University,"The study was funded by Bilsland Strategic Initiatives Grant, Graduate School, Purdue University, Indiana.",,"Anderson, M., Shrum, W., Circumvention and social change: ICTs and the discourse of empowerment (2007) Women’s Studies in Communication, 30, pp. 229-253; Bakhtin, M.M., Discourse in the novel (1981) The dialogic imagination: Four essays by M.

Former refugee parents from Ethiopia, Congo, and Burma ((Formula presented.) = 221) completed this and other questionnaires measuring demographics, acculturation, and acculturative stress. Exploratory factor analysis indicated three factors: “Engagement,” “Hope and Aspirations,” and “Dissonance.” The subscales were internally consistent. Second, this newly developed scale was used to explore whether the parents’ communication and relations with their children were associated with demographics, acculturation, and acculturative stress. Results of multiple regressions indicated that mothers and parents with higher acculturation were more engaged with their children and also encouraged their children to aspire for higher goals in life. Although parents with higher acculturative stress were also developing aspirations and hopes in their children; they reported strained relations with their children. Parents from the Congo scored higher on dissonance, indicating some problematic communication with their children. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,LP120200076,This research project was supported by a two-year Australian Research Council Linkage Project Grant LP120200076.,,"Allen, P., Bennett, K., (2012) SPSS 20: A practical guide, , 2nd ed., South Melbourne, Australia: Cengage Learning Australia; (2015) Global refugee crisis–by the numbers, , https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2015/10/global-refugee-crisis-by-the-numbers, October, Retrieved from; Areepattamannil, S., Lee, D.H.L., Linking immigrant parents’ educational expectations and aspirations to their children’s school performance (2014) The Journal of Genetic Psychology, 175, pp. 51-57; Barbato, C.A., Graham, E.E., Perse, E.M., Communicating in the family: An examination of the relationship of family communication climate and interpersonal communication motives (2003) Journal of Family Communication, 3, pp. 123-148; Bartholomew, T.T., Gundel, B.E., Kantamneni, N., A dream best forgotten: The phenomenology of Karen refugees’ pre-resettlement stressors (2015) The Counseling Psychologist, 43, pp. 1114-1134; Baxter, L.A., Akkoor, C., Topic expansiveness and family communication patterns (2011) Journal of Family Communication, 11, pp. 1-20; Beiser, M., Resettling refugees and safeguarding their mental health: Lessons learned from the Canadian refugee resettlement project (2009) Transcultural Psychiatry, 46, pp. 539-583; Berry, J.W., Phinney, J.S., Sam, D.L., Vedder, P., Immigrant youth: Acculturation, identity, and adaptation (2006) Applied Psychology: An International Review, 55, pp. 303-332; Betancourt, T.S., We left one war and came to another: Resource loss, acculturative stress, and caregiver–child relationships in Somali refugee families (2015) Cultural Diversity & Ethnic Minority Pychology, 21, pp. 114-125; Blankers, E., (2013) A new generation: How refugee trauma affects parenting and child development, , Unpublished doctoral dissertation, Utretcht University, Utrecht, The Netherlands; Bosticco, C., Thompson, T., The role of communication and story telling in the family grieving system (2009) Journal of Family Communication, 5, pp. 255-278; Braga, L.L., Mello, M.F., Fiks, J.P., Transgenerational transmission of trauma and resilience: A qualitative study with Brazilian offspring of Holocaust survivors (2012) BMC Psychiatry, 12, pp. 1-12; Brislin, R., Back-translation for cross-cultural research (1970) Journal of Cross-Cultural Psychology, 1, pp. 185-216; Bylund, C.L., Ethnic diversity and family stories (2003) Journal of Family Communication, 3, pp. 215-236; Condron, D., Social class, school and non-school environments, and black/white inequalities in children’s learning (2009) American Sociological Review, 78, pp. 683-708; Correa-Velez, I., Barnett, A.G., Gifford, S., Working for a better life: Longitudinal evidence on the predictors of employment among recently arrived refugee migrant men living in Australia (2015) International Migration, 53, pp. 321-337; Dalgaard, N.T., Montgomery, E., Disclosure and silencing: A systematic review of the literature on patterns of trauma communication in refugee families (2015) Transcultural Psychiatry, 52, pp. 579-593; Deng, S.A., Marlowe, J.M., Refugee resettlement and parenting in a different context (2013) Journal of Immigrant & Refugee Studies, 11, pp. 416-430; (2013) Migration programme statistics, , Belconen, Australia: Commonwealth of Australia; Dona, G., Young, M., Refugees and forced migrants (2016) The Cambridge handbook of acculturation psychology, pp. 153-172. , Sam D., Berry J., (eds), Cambridge, United Kingdom: Cambridge University Press, &,.

These family farms may struggle to balance both family relationships and business concerns, which can cause conflict among members. Some of this conflict may be derived from the independent, self-reliant nature of family farmers. These characteristics may influence how family farm members are able to deal with conflict, and how they choose to communicate during conflict interactions. This project used intragroup conflict theory and family communication patterns to explore the impact of everyday conflict on job satisfaction, communication satisfaction, and profitability in family farm businesses. Survey data were collected from family farm members (N = 204). The results of structural equation modeling showed conversation and conformity orientation significantly predicted relational, process, and status conflict in the model, yet only status conflict significantly predicted communication satisfaction. These findings suggested family farm members struggle with communication, which influences status conflict experiences and communication satisfaction. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Alderson, K., Conflict management and resolution in family-owned businesses: A practitioner focused review (2015) Journal of Family Business Management, 5, pp. 140-156; Beck, S.J., Ledbetter, A.M., The influence of parent conflict style on children (2013) Personal Relationships, 20, pp. 495-510; Beck, S.J., Miller, A., Frahm, W., An alternative approach to family communication: Studying family from a group communication perspective (2011) Communication yearbook, 35. , Salmon C.T., (ed), New York, NY: Routledge, &,.

Women experiencing PD/PPD must cope with negative feelings and detrimental outcomes that stand in contrast with cultural conceptions of how (ideal) mothers feel and act (i.e., the discourse of intensive mothering), thus furthering stigma and negativity surrounding the PD/PPD experience. The present study, couched in relational dialectics theory, aims to explore how women, through naturally occurring online narratives, make sense of motherhood in light of both PD/PPD experiences and cultural expectations/understandings of mothers. Throughout the narrative corpus, the culturally dominant Discourse of (Self-)Sacrificing Blissful Moms (DSBM)—which expands on the discourse of intensive mothering—is de-centered, albeit never fully delegitimated, by the Discourse of Mothers as Whole People (DMWP). Rather than closing down the DSBM, the DMWP works to expand meanings of what “good” mothers can feel and do.

To examine how families navigate this complex, emotionally stressful situation, Problematic Integration theory was applied as a lens for understanding EOL decision experiences managed in the context of the family. Drawing on qualitative data from interviews with 22 family members who participated in family conversations about an end-of-life decision, this study demonstrated that family members encounter multiple sources of uncertainty and divergence, including questions regarding whether or not a family member’s life is ending, what the decision should be, and who should make or participate in the decision. Family members’ stories also identified ways in which medical professionals and communication about the wishes of the patient helped family members manage problematic integration. Finally, findings revealed experiences where problematic orientations were not transformed after family members made an EOL decision. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Abbott, K.H., Sago, J.G., Breen, C.M., Abernethy, A.P., Tulsky, J.A., Families looking back: One year after withdrawal or withholding of life-sustaining support (2001) Critical Care Medicine, 29, pp. 197-201; Ahrens, T., Yancey, V., Kollef, M., Improving family communications at the end of life: Implications for length of stay in the intensive care unit and resource use (2003) American Journal of Critical Care, 12, pp. 317-323; Babrow, A.S., Communication and problematic integration: Understanding diverging probability and value, ambiguity, ambivalence, and impossibility (1992) Communication Theory, 2, pp. 95-130; Babrow, A.S., Communication and problematic integration: Milan Kundera’s “Lost Letters” in (1995) The Book of Laughter and Forgetting.

The current article examines the construct of conformity, arguing that current conceptualizations of conformity paint this behavior as largely a negative familial element. Instead, this research argues for the concept of warm conformity behavior, where parents communicate their ideas in ways that promote warmth and closeness rather than just adherence to hierarchy and rules. This move does not add to the two dimensions of the theory, but rather speaks to the different ways in which parents might communicate the dimension of conformity to their child. To further this idea, our article includes a series of three studies designed to create and validate new measures of warm and cold conformity. Overall, the studies found general support for the validity of the scales. Implications and directions for future research are discussed. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Abel, J.D., The family and child television viewing (1976) Journal of Marriage and Family, 38, pp. 331-335; Afifi, T.D., Olson, L., The chilling effect in families and the pressure to conceal secrets (2005) Communication Monographs, 72, pp. 192-216; Anderson, C., Kilduff, G.J., Why do dominant personalities attain influence in face-to-face groups?

EAs are a newly recognized population of youth, 18–25 years of age, who are developmentally between adolescence and young adulthood. Guided by the life span communication perspective, we interviewed 98 EAs (30 males and 68 females, M age = 19.09, SD = 1.72) about their experiences providing support to a parent with a chronic health condition. Many EAs in this study said they provided “understanding” and our interpretive thematic analyses uncovered two broad meanings of the word: it is a form of support that EAs both have and communicate. When EAs have understanding, they have knowledge about the health condition and how it affects their parent. They also have acceptance to some degree that the health condition is a fixture of their lives and that their parents are imperfect and fallible people. They communicate the understanding they have through reciprocating support, sacrificing, being obedient, avoiding sensitive topics, and projecting emotional strength. We discuss the findings and their implications for emerging adult development as well as parent-child relational development parallel to difficult long-term health issues in families. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Adelman, R.D., Tmanova, L.L., Delgado, D., Dion, S., Lachs, M.S., Caregiver burden: A clinical review (2014) Journal of the American Medical Association, 311, pp. 1052-1060; Arnett, J.J., Emerging adulthood: A theory of development from the late teens through the twenties (2000) American Psychologist, 55, pp. 469-480; Arnett, J.J., (2014) Emerging adulthood: The winding road from the late teens through the twenties, , 2nd ed., Oxford, UK: Oxford University Press; Baltes, P.B., Theoretical propositions of life-span developmental psychology: On the dynamics between growth and decline (1987) Developmental Psychology, 23, pp. 611-626; Baxter, L.A., Norwood, K.M., Relational dialectics theory: Navigating meaning from competing discourses (2015) Engaging theories in interpersonal communication.

As such, it is increasingly important to know about the role of media in the lives of families. Although much is known about the impact of media on children as individuals, far less attention has been given to the impact of media on the family as a whole. A great deal of the research on the family and media focuses on parent-child interactions, relationships, and media practices. While parenting is a key element in family life, other members of the family contribute to family practices and interactions, particularly siblings. This article proposes future directions for research about media and families, turning attention to expanding parenting research beyond media mediation, employment of more observational and ethnographic studies of families and media, and exploring media uses with siblings which continues to be an area of limited focus within the field. Moreover, future research should examine families with different lived experiences both in how their media practices and how they are portrayed within the media. Through research, scholars can serve families as media mentors—supporting families in their media practices in an informed way. We have the ability to be excellent media mentors to families and a key component of that is to continue to find answers to questions for families through research. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Bagley, S., Salmon, J.O., Crawford, D., Family structure and children’s television viewing and physical activity (2006) Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise, 38, pp. 910-918; Brown, A., Shifrin, D.L., Hill, D.L., Beyond ‘turn it off’: How to advise families on media use (2015) AAP News, 36 (10), p. 54. , http://www.aappublications.org/content/36/10/54, Retrieved from; Clark, L.S., Parental mediation theory for the digital age (2011) Communication Theory, 21, pp. 323-343; Coyne, S.M., Jensen, A.C., Smith, N.J., Erickson, D.H., Super Mario brothers and sisters: Associations between coplaying video games and sibling conflict and affection (2016) Journal of Adolescence, 47, pp. 48-59; Davies, J.J., Gentile, D.A., Responses to children’s media use in families with and without siblings: A family development perspective (2012) Family Relations, 61, pp. 410-425; Haefner, M.J., Wartella, E.A., Effects of sibling coviewing on children’s interpretations of television programs (1987) Journal of Broadcasting & Electronic Media, 31, pp. 153-168; Haines, C., Campbell, C., (2016) Becoming a media mentor: A guide for working with children and families, , Chicago, IL: American Library Association; Harrison, K., Media and the family (2015) Journal of Children and Media, 9, pp. 1-4; Hindle, D., Sherwin-White, S., (2014) Sibling matters: A psychoanalytic, developmental, and systemic approach, , London, UK: Karnac Books; Jennings, N., Wartella, E., Technology and the family (2013) The handbook of family communication, , Vangelisti A., (ed), 2nd ed., Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates; Jiow, J.H., Lim, S.S., Lin, J., Level up!

The sample included 19 parents from the United States, United Kingdom, and Canada, who experienced infertility, were in a lesbian relationship, or identified as solo parents. The researchers identified face-related concerns parents have for themselves and their children and preventative facework strategies they enact to avoid or minimize face loss. Findings showcase parents’ desire for social approval, autonomy, respect, and preventing rejection.

Permanence was constituted by themes of biology and historical connection, reifying normative understandings. Performance, comprised of role enactment, need for tolerance, and unconditional love, challenged the Permanence discourse. Throughout the narratives, Performance competed with Permanence for dominance, illustrating the cultural pervasiveness and power of Permanence yet, in some moments, privileging the marginalized Performance discourse. This discursive competition constructed meanings of family in narratives of life before, during, and after foster care. Overall, participant’s talk constructed complex webs of family relationships, allowing access to an important social institution—family—regardless of the presence/absence of culturally valued markers of family (e.g., biology, legality). © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Argys, L., Duncan, B., Economic incentives and foster child adoption (2013) Demography, 50, pp. 933-954; Bakhtin, M.M., Discourse in the novel (1981) The dialogic imagination: Four essays by M.

Few scholars (e.g., Nelson, 2014) have explored the communicative process through which a sense of family is created and maintained in foster families, despite the potential positive impact that developing a foster family identity may have on foster family functioning. The purpose of the present study was to understand the communicative strategies that foster parents use to create family identity. Data from interviews with 18 current and former foster parents revealed that through their talk inside and outside of the family, foster parents engaged in integrating biological and foster families, ritualizing, explaining, labeling family roles, and reframing. I discuss the importance of these findings for foster families. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Atwool, N., Birth family contact for children in care: How much? How often? Who with?

This raises the question to what extent adolescents are interested in communicating with their parents about religion. In a cross-sectional study of 498 Belgian adolescents ages 12–18-years (mean age = 14.94, SD = 1.34), we examined how adolescent interest in communicating with parents about religion was related to the link between parental religious socialization messages and adolescent religious out-group attitudes. Testing two models, we aimed to understand whether (a) adolescent interest in communicating with parents about religion mediated the link between parental religious socialization and adolescent religious out-group attitudes or (b) parental religious socialization mediated the link between adolescent interest in communicating with parents about religion and adolescent religious out-group attitudes. Results revealed a dynamic interplay between study variables, and highlighted the importance of considering adolescent interest in communicating with parents about religion. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Aboud, F.E., The formation of in-group favoritism and out-group prejudice in young children: Are they distinct attitudes?

Participants (N = 594) from the United States, China, and Saudi Arabia completed self-report questionnaires that included questions about their family’s conversation and conformity orientations, relational closeness, and their conflict styles with their parents. The results show that conversation orientation is a positive predictor of collaboration and compromise, conformity orientation is a positive predictor of accommodation and avoidance, and relational closeness is a negative predictor of dominance across cultures. Relational closeness also interacts with conversation orientation to influence dominance. The cross-cultural invariance provides empirical evidence of the universal application of FCP in family conflict communication. More importantly, significant interactions between culture and conformity orientation and closeness show that culture’s influence on family communication is better understood through indirect rather than direct roles. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Adams, R., Laursen, B., The organization and dynamics of adolescent conflict with parents and friends (2001) Journal of Marriage and Family, 63, pp. 97-110;

Little research, however, examines CIL perceptions of in-law relationships (ILRs) beyond the newlywed years. Drawing on the life course perspective and socioemotional selectivity theory, we hypothesized that marital duration would predict how frequently CIL encountered positive and negative PIL behaviors, and account for the degree to which these behaviors were appraised favorably or as problematic. A total of 179 individuals rated how often a target PIL provided informational support, instrumental support, emotional support, and companionship, and how frequently the target PIL was intrusive, rejecting, insensitive, and failed to help. The frequency with which both positive and negative in-law behaviors were experienced was predicted by marital duration (but not CIL age or PIL age), although quadratic and cubic marital duration terms were better predictors than the linear term. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Aquilino, W.S., From adolescent to young adult: A prospective study of parent-child relations during the transition to adulthood (1997) Journal of Marriage and Family, 59, pp. 670-686; Baltes, P.B., Staudinger, U.M., Lindenberger, U., Lifespan psychology: Theory and application to intellectual functioning (1999) Annual Review of Psychology, 50, pp. 471-507; Birditt, K.S., Fingerman, K.L., Age and gender differences in adults’ descriptions of emotional reactions to interpersonal tensions (2003) Journal of Gerontology: Psychological Sciences, 58B, pp. 237-245; Birditt, K.S., Fingerman, K.L., Almeida, D.M., Age differences in exposure and reactions to interpersonal tensions: A daily diary study (2005) Psychology and Aging, 20, pp. 330-340; Boerner, K., Reinhardt, J.P., Raykov, T., Horowitz, A., Stability and change in social negativity in later life: Reducing received while maintaining initiated negativity (2004) Journal of Gerontology: Social Sciences, 59B, pp. 230-237; Bryant, C.M., Conger, R.D., Meehan, J.M., The influence of in-laws on change in marital success (2001) Journal of Marriage and Family, 63, pp. 614-626; Byron, G.G., Halleck, F., (1844) The works of Lord Byron, in verse and prose, including his letters, journals, etc., with a sketch of his life, , New York, NY: Alexander Blake; Carstensen, L.L., Social and emotional patterns in adulthood: Support for socioemotional selectivity theory (1992) Psychology and Aging, 7, pp. 331-338; Carstensen, L.L., Gottman, J.M., Levenson, R.W., Emotional behavior in long-term marriage (1995) Psychology and Aging, 10, pp. 140-149; Carstensen, L.L., Isaacowitz, D.M., Charles, S.T., Taking time seriously: A theory of socioemotional selectivity (1999) American Psychologist, 54, pp. 165-181; Caughlin, J.P., Family communication standards: What counts as excellent family communication and how are such standards associated with family satisfaction?

Participants included 241 young adult children who completed online surveys. Results indicate that parents’ negative disclosures to their children mediated the associations between both dimensions of coparental communication and both relational outcomes. Indirect effects of supportive and antagonistic coparental communication through mothers’ negative disclosures emerged for children’s closeness with mothers, but not satisfaction. Indirect effects of both forms of coparental communication through mothers’ negative disclosures also emerged for children’s closeness and satisfaction with fathers. Ultimately, the results underscore the importance of disclosure as an explanatory mechanism for the associations between coparental communication patterns and relational quality in parent-child relationships. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Adamsons, K., Pasley, K., Coparenting following divorce and relationship dissolution (2006) Handbook of divorce and relationship dissolution, , Fine M.A., Harvey J.H., (eds), Mahwah, NJ: Erlbaum;

In particular, in this work I critique the traditional philosophical perspective, arguing that the isolation of paradigms, and the positioning of research as post-positivist or interpretivist or critical, limits the production and capacity of knowledge, and therefore the field as a whole. As a response, I put forth Deetz’s (2001) discursive orientations as a more inclusive and comprehensive perspective from which family communication research should be conducted, with the crux of the argument being that the fluid nature of Deetz’s orientations positions knowledge as existing between and within, therefore allowing research to be both/and instead of either/or, and subsequently producing knowledge that is inherently more complete and inclusive. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Abdi, S., Van Gilder, B., Cultural (in)visibility and identity dissonance: Queer Iranian American women and their negotiation of existence (2015) Journal of International and Intercultural Communication, 9, pp. 69-86; Afifi, T.A., Feeling caught” in stepfamilies: Managing boundary turbulence through appropriate communication rules (2003) Journal of Social and Personal Relationships, 20, pp. 729-756; Akkoor, C., Is he my real uncle?

In semistructured interviews, 29 grandparents described positive and negative interactions with a child (or child-in-law). Participants graphed changes in the intergenerational relationship with the first-time parents, from the moment the pregnancy was announced through their interview, when the grandchild was up to two years of age. Inductive analysis showed four trajectories, which we describe in detail using informants’ reports. Highlighting the volatility of the transition from a parent and child to grandparent and new parent, the most common patterns were Turbulent and Dipped, and the results include variants of these two trajectories. We compare grandparents’ retrospectively recalled experiences with the reports of new parents from previous research to facilitate a deeper understanding of intergenerational relationships during a highly unsettled transition. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,"Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada, SSHRC",This research was supported by an award from the Research Development Initiatives Program of the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada.,,"Bangerter, L.R., Waldron, V.R., Turning points in long distance grandparent–grandchild relationships (2014) Journal of Aging Studies, 29, pp. 88-97;

Analysis of their narratives suggests health literacy is important in family caregiver/healthcare provider communication, especially as complicated illnesses move the caregiver deeper into decision making. Using the domains of Yuen et al.’s conceptual model of caregiver health literacy (2015), we identified three themes within the context of ICU communication: agency, coordinated communication, and caregiver’s evolving role. We saw family caregivers negotiating domains of health literacy as they built upon knowledge of the patient’s needs, their rights as family caregivers, and the hierarchy of the professional staff. We found that these narratives represent co-created, or relational communication, rather than individual health literacy skills. Conceptualized in the transaction of relationship, health literacy is enacted; it is socially constructed and is the scaffolding upon which family caregivers make decisions, care for their loved one, and care for themselves. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,DAISY Foundation,This study was funded by a DAISY Foundation J.

Data were collected from 423 participants (recruited in classrooms and online) who completed an online survey. Results revealed four genealogical communication behaviors: (a) frequent engagement, (b) coherent perspectives (i.e., regarding family history), (c) personal research, and (d) dark side. Family communication patterns predicted these genealogical communication behaviors, which in turn predicted family satisfaction, with genealogical communication dimensions serving as significant mediators. Among the identified dimensions of genealogical communication, coherent perspectives served as a particularly consistent predictor and mediator regarding extended and immediate family satisfaction. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Baxter, L.A., Babbie, E.R., (2004) The basics of communication research, , Belmont, CA: Wadsworth; Baxter, L.A., Braithwaite, D.O., Introduction: Meta-theory and theory in family communication research (2006) Engaging theories in family communication: Multiple perspectives, , Baxter L.A., Braithwaite D.O., (eds), Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage; Berger, C.R., Calabrese, R., Some explorations in initial interaction and beyond: Toward a developmental theory of interpersonal communication (1975) Human Communication Research, 1, pp. 99-112; Bishop, R., In the grand scheme of things: An exploration of the meaning of genealogical research (2008) The Journal of Popular Culture, 41, pp. 393-412; Curran, D., (1983) Traits of a healthy family: Fifteen traits commonly found in healthy families by those who work with them, , Minneapolis, MN: Winston Press; Darby, P., Clough, P., Investigating the information-seeking behaviour of genealogists and family historians (2013) Journal of Information Science, 39, pp. 73-84; Farnham, A., Who’s your daddy?

Knight School of Communication, Queens University of Charlotte, United States","This study explored the uncertainty management processes experienced by parents at home following their child’s discharge from the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). In-depth, semistructured interviews were conducted with 18 mothers and fathers whose children were cared for and “graduated” from NICU units in seven different hospitals from 6 to 183 days (M = 63.58 days). Interviews revealed three types of parental uncertainties: parental role shift, caring through equipment, and adherence to provider advice. Parents relied on three strategies to manage these uncertainties: reorientation, calibrating appropriate responses, and limiting exposure. Findings highlight how parental experiences, communication interactions, and expectations in the NICU complicate parental uncertainties postdischarge and negatively affect parental perceptions of self-efficacy, readiness, and competency. Our findings suggest that family-centered care can be enhanced by redefining discharge as an ongoing process that necessitates distinct uncertainty management practices to negotiate tensions between protecting preterm children and supporting parents. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Afifi, W.A., Matsunaga, M., Uncertainty management theories (2008) Engaging theories in interpersonal communication, , Baxter L.A., Braithwaite D.O., (eds), Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage; Hospital discharge of the high-risk neonate (2008) Pediatrics, 122, pp. 1119-1126; Babrow, A.S., Kasch, C.R., Ford, L.A., The many meanings of uncertainty in illness: Toward a systematic accounting (1998) Health Communication, 10, pp. 1-23; Berger, C.R., Calebrese, R.J., Some explorations in initial interaction and beyond: Toward a developmental theory of interpersonal communication (1975) Human Communication Research, 1, pp. 99-112; Brashers, D.E., Communication and uncertainty management (2001) Journal of Communication, 51, pp. 477-497; Brashers, D.E., A theory of communication and uncertainty management (2007) Explaining communication: Contemporary theories and exemplars, , Whaley B.B., Samter W., (eds), Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates; Brashers, D.E., Goldsmith, D.J., Hsieh, E., Information seeking and avoiding in health contexts (2002) Human Communication Research, 28, pp. 258-271; Brashers, D.E., Hsieh, E., Neidig, J.L., Reynolds, N.R., Managing uncertainty about illness: Health care providers as credible authorities (2006) Applied interpersonal communication matters: Family, health, & community relations, , Dailey R.M., Le Poire B.A., (eds), New York, NY: Peter Lang; Bruder, M.B., Cole, M., Critical elements of transition from NICU to home and follow-up (1991) Children’s Health Care, 20, pp. 40-49; Cawthon, C., Walia, S., Osborn, C.Y., Niesner, K.J., Schnipper, J.L., Kripalani, S., Improving care transitions: The patient perspective (2012) Journal of Health Communication, 17, pp. 312-324; (2015) Preterm birth, , http://www.cdc.gov/reproductivehealth/maternalinfanthealth/pretermbirth.htm, Retrieved from; Charchuk, M., Simpson, C., Hope, disclosure, and control in the neonatal intensive care unit (2005) Health Communication, 17, pp. 191-203; Corbin, J., Strauss, A., (2008) Basics of qualitative research, , 3rd ed., Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage; Davis, C.W., Myers, K.K., Communication and member disengagement in planned organizational exit (2012) Western Journal of Communication, 76, pp. 194-216; Dellenmark-Blom, M., Wigert, H., Parents’ experiences with neonatal home care following initial care in the neonatal intensive care unit: A phenomenological hermeneutical interview study (2014) Journal of Advanced Nursing, 70, pp. 575-586; Dillard, J.P., Carson, C.L., Uncertainty management following a positive newborn screening for cystic fibrosis (2005) Journal of Health Communication, 10, pp. 57-76; Dokken, D., Ahmann, E., The many roles of family members in ‘family-centered care’—Part I (2006) Pediatric Nursing, 32, pp. 562-565; Glaser, B.G., Strauss, A.L., (1967) The discovery of grounded theory: Strategies for qualitative research, , New York, NY: Aldine de Gruyter; Goldsmith, D.J., A normative approach to the study of uncertainty and communication (2001) Journal of Communication, 51, pp. 514-533; Golish, T.D., Powell, K.A., ‘Ambiguous loss’: Managing the dialectics of grief associated with premature birth (2003) Journal of Social and Personal Relationships, 20, pp. 309-334; Holditch-Davis, D., Bartlett, T.R., Blickman, A.L., Miles, M.S., Posttraumatic stress symptoms in mothers of premature infants (2003) Journal of Obstetric, Gynecologic, & Neonatal Nursing, 32, pp. 161-171; Hughes, M.A., McCollum, J., Neonatal intensive care: Mothers’ and fathers’ perceptions of what is stressful (1994) Journal of Early Intervention, 18, pp. 258-268; Hutchinson, S.W., Spillett, M.A., Cronin, M., Parents’ experiences during their infant’s transition from neonatal intensive care unit to home: A qualitative study (2012) The Qualitative Report, 17, pp. 1-20; Jones, L., Woodhouse, D., Rowe, J., Effective nurse parent communication: A study of parents’ perceptions in the NICU environment (2007) Patient Education and Counseling, 69, pp. 206-212; Kramer, M., (2004) Managing uncertainty in organizational communication, , Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates; Lasiuk, G.C., Comeau, T., Newburn-Cook, C., Unexpected: An interpretive description of parental traumas’ associated with preterm birth (2013) BMC Pregnancy Childbirth, 13. , http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3561145/, Retrieved from; Lopez, G.L., Anderson, K.H., Feutchinger, J., Transition of premature infants from hospital to home life (2012) Neonatal Network, 31, pp. 207-214; Martin, J.A., Osterman, M.J., Sutton, P.D., (2010) Are preterm births on the decline in the United States?

Eleven schools in two rural school districts in the Midwestern United States were selected, and 784 students were surveyed at three time points from the beginning of 7th grade to the end of 8th grade. A series of latent profile analyses were performed to identify discrete profiles/subgroups of substance-specific prevention communication (SSPC). The results revealed a 4-profile model of SSPC: Active-Open, Passive-Open, Active-Silent, and Passive-Silent. A growth curve model revealed different rates of lifetime substance use depending on the youth’s SSPC profile. These findings have implications for parenting interventions and tailoring messages for parents to fit specific SSPC profiles. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,"National Institute on Drug Abuse, NIDA

Young adult use of illicit substances is particularly concerning. Parents can play an important role in substance use intervention and prevention, but their efforts are sometimes unsuccessful. Therefore, it is important to consider how parents respond to and communicate about their young adult children’s substance use disorder. Most research has privileged confrontation and direct communication as effective coping responses, but evidence suggests that effectiveness hinges on the meanings interactants ascribe to behavior. Through qualitative interviews, the current study develops normative theory regarding parents’ communication challenges and strategies in response to their young adult child’s substance use disorder. Parents’ challenges center on the intersection of support with their own substance use history; others’ divergent views on substance use; uncertainty in illness; relational closeness and harmony; and illness features. Results are discussed in terms of implications for helping parents respond to their young adult child’s substance use disorder. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"(2013) Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders, , 5th ed., Arlington, VA: American Psychiatric Association; Arnett, J.J., Emerging adulthood: A theory of development from the late teens through the twenties (2000) American Psychologist, 55, pp. 469-480; Barnard, M., (2005) Drugs in the family, , Glasgow, UK: Rowntree Foundation; Barnard, M., Barlow, J., Discovering parental drug dependence: Silence and disclosure (2003) Children and Society, 17, pp. 45-56; Caughlin, J., Afifi, T.D., When is topic avoidance unsatisfying?

Thirty-five college students reported on how they and a sibling discuss drinking that is perceived as problematic and described behaviors related to the problematic drinking. Interviews were transcribed and coded in two separate rounds of coding; the first round identified categories related to INC theory (reinforcement, punishment, and labeling). Reinforcement often took the form of avoiding the topic of drinking and using drinking as a means for bonding. Punishment primarily took the form of confrontation. The second round identified such themes as frustration at the inability to stop a sibling’s drinking, a tendency to overlook the severity of the drinking, and a combination of wanting to discuss alcohol openly, but also wanting to avoid discussions about negative consequences. There were five primary descriptions of power dynamics: equal and open with one another (friend-like relationship), one sibling in control (parent-like relationship), power as context-based, power changing over the course of the relationship due to a significant event (i.e., parents’ divorce), and power as a personality trait. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Adams, B.N., Birth order: A critical review (1972) Sociometry, 35, pp. 411-439; Ary, D.V., Tildesley, E., Hops, H., Andrews, J., The influence of parent, sibling, and peer modeling and attitudes on adolescent use of alcohol (1993) Substance Use & Misuse, 28, pp. 853-880; Azmitia, M., Hesser, J., Why siblings are important agents of cognitive development: A comparison of siblings and peers (1993) Child Development, 64, pp. 430-444; Bahr, S.J., Hoffmann, J.P., Yang, X., Parental and peer influences on the risk of adolescent drug use (2005) Journal of Primary Prevention, 26, pp. 529-551; Bank, S., Kahn, M.D., Sisterhood‐brotherhood is powerful: Sibling sub‐systems and family therapy (1975) Family Process, 14, pp. 311-337; Bank, S., Kahn, M.D., Intense sibling loyalties (1982) Sibling relationships: Their nature and significance across the lifespan, , Lamb M.E., Sutton-Smith B., (eds), New York, NY: Psychology Press; Barnes, G.M., Impact of the family on adolescent drinking patterns (1990) Alcohol and the family: Research and clinical perspectives, , Collilns R.L., Leonard K.E., Searles J.S., (eds), New York, NY: Guilford Press; (2003), http://www.wordscanwork.com/newimages/Alcohol_True_Stories_Guide.pdf, Alcohol: True stories.

Early adolescents in 7th and 8th grades completed a self-report, cross-sectional survey. Structural equation modeling revealed that family expressiveness was significantly indirectly related to adolescent lifetime alcohol use through SSPC. Results are discussed in relation to primary socialization theory, family communication, and international substance use prevention efforts. This study provides supportive evidence for the important role of positive family communication as a protective factor for early adolescents in Nicaragua. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,"University of Tennessee, UT","This research was supported in part by grant number S-INLEC-13-GR-1012 from the Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs to the University of Tennessee (Jonathan Pettigrew, Principal Investigator).",,"Bandura, A., Self-efficacy: Toward a unifying theory of behavioral change (1977) Psychological Review, 84, pp. 191-215; Bandura, A., Guide for constructing self-efficacy scales (2006) Self-efficacy beliefs of adolescents, , Pajares F., Urdan T.C., (eds), Greenwich, CT: IAP; Baruch, Y., Holtom, B.C., Survey response rate levels and trends in organizational research (2008) Human Relations, 61, pp. 1139-1160; Baumrind, D., Current patterns of parental authority (1971) Developmental Psychology, 4, pp. 1-103; Baumrind, D., Authoritative parenting revisited: History and current status (2013) Authoritative parenting: Synthesizing nurturance and discipline for optimal child development, , Larzelere R.E., Morris A.S., Harrist A.W., (eds), Washington, DC: American Psychological Association; Becoña, E., Martínez, Ú., Calafat, A., Juan, M., Fernández-Hermida, J.R., Secades-Villa, R., Parental styles and drug use: A review (2012) Drugs: Education, Prevention and Policy, 19, pp. 1-10; Bochner, A.P., Conceptual frontiers in the study of communication in families: An introduction to the literature (1976) Human Communication Research, 2, pp. 381-397; Boden, J.M., Fergusson, D.M., Alcohol and depression (2011) Addiction, 106, pp. 906-914; Boisvert, D., Wright, J.P., Knopik, V., Vaske, J., Genetic and environmental overlap between low self-control and delinquency (2012) Journal of Quantitative Criminology, 28, pp. 477-507; Cavaiola, A.A., Desordi, E.G., Locus of control in drinking driving offenders and non-offenders (2000) Alcoholism Treatment Quarterly, 18, pp. 63-73; Cavaiola, A.A., Strohmetz, D.B., Perception of risk for subsequent drinking and driving related offenses and locus of control among first-time DUI offenders (2010) Alcoholism Treatment Quarterly, 28, pp. 52-62; Choi, H.J., Krieger, J.L., Hecht, M.L., Reconceptualizing efficacy in substance use prevention research: Refusal response efficacy and drug resistance self-efficacy in adolescent substance use (2013) Health Communication, 28, pp. 40-52; Parent prevention communication profiles and adolescent substance use: A latent profile analysis and growth curve model (2017) Journal of Family Communication, 17, pp. 15-32; (2015), http://www.oas.org/dil/esp/Codigo_de_la_Ninez_y_la_Adolescencia_Nicaragua.pdf, Retrieved from; D’Amico, E.J., Ellickson, P.L., Collins, R.L., Martino, S., Klein, D.J., Processes linking adolescent problems to substance-use problems in late young adulthood (2005) Journal of Studies on Alcohol, 66, pp. 766-775; Degenhardt, L., Hall, W., Extent of illicit drug use and dependence, and their contribution to the global burden of disease (2012) The Lancet, 379, pp. 55-70; Dishion, T.J., Patterson, G.R., The development and ecology of antisocial behavior in children and adolescents (2006) Developmental psychopathology, risk, disorder, and adaptation, , Cicchetti D., Cohen D.J., (eds), New York, NY: Wiley; Dormitzer, C.M., Gonzalez, G.B., Penna, M., Bejarano, J., Obando, P., Sanchez, M., Anthony, J.C., The PACARDO research project: Youthful drug involvement in Central America and the Dominican Republic (2004) Revista Panamericana de Salud Pública, 15, pp. 400-416; Dudley, S.S., Drug trafficking organizations in Central America: Transportistas, Mexican cartels and maras (2010) Shared responsibility: U.S.–Mexico policy options for confronting organized crime, , Olson E.L., Shrink D.A., Selee A., (eds), Washington, DC: Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars; Ebersole, D.S., Miller-Day, M., Raup-Krieger, J., Do actions speak louder than words?

To explore the role that communication plays in helping family partners demonstrate resilience (i.e., competence and adaptation throughout the experience of a stressor), while dealing with involuntary unemployment, the current study surveyed a sample of 111 recently unemployed, relationally involved participants. The majority of these participants self-reported as married (40.6%) or indicated serious commitment (38.6%) with their relational partner. Communication strategies perceived as contributing to resilience with their partner were measured as Resilience-Promoting Communication (RPC). Bootstrapping mediation analysis determined that RPC dimensions emphasizing respect/harmony, partnership and tension release contributed to mediation of the relationship between feelings about job loss on relational satisfaction and commitment. In addition, respect/harmony moderated the relationship between both unemployment affect and commitment and satisfaction. Civility moderated the relationship between unemployment affect and satisfaction. Implications of these findings for theory and for families dealing with unemployment are discussed. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.",,,,,,,University of Texas at Austin,"This research was funded, in part, by the College of Communication Career Development Grant, University of Texas at Austin.",,"Afifi, T.D., Davis, S., Merrill, A.F., Coveleski, S., Denes, A., Afifi, W., In the wake of the Great Recession: Economic uncertainty, communication, biological stress responses in families (2015) Human Communication Research, 41, pp. 268-302; Afifi, T.D., Hutchinson, S., Krouse, S., Toward a theoretical model of communal coping in postdivorce families and other naturally occurring groups (2006) Communication Theory, 16, pp. 378-409; Afifi, T.D., Keith, S., A risk and resiliency model of ambiguous loss in post-divorce stepfamilies (2004) Journal of Family Communication, 4, pp. 65-98; Afifi, T.D., Merrill, A.F., Davis, S., (2015) The theory of resilience and relational load, , May, Paper presented at the annual meeting of the International Communication Association, San Juan, Puerto Rico; Beck, G.A., Socha, T.J., (2015) Communicating hope and resilience across the lifespan, , New York, NY: Peter Lang; Bodenmann, G., (2000) Stress and coping in couples, , Gottingen, Germany: Hogrefe; Buzzanell, P.M., Presidential address – resilience: Talking, resisting, and imagining, new normalcies into being (2010) Journal of Communication, 60, pp. 1-14; Buzzanell, P.M., Turner, L.H., Emotion work revealed by job loss discourse: Backgrounding-foregrounding of feelings, construction of normalcy, and (re)instituting of traditional masculinities (2003) Journal of Applied Communication Research, 31, pp. 27-57; Caplan, R.D., Vinokur, A.D., Price, R.H., Van Ryn, M., Job seeking, reemployment, and mental health: A randomized field experiment in coping with job loss (1989) Journal of Applied Psychology, 74, pp. 759-769; Carr, K., Communication and family resilience (2015) International encyclopedia of interpersonal communication, , Berger C.R., Roloff M.E., (eds), Hoboken, NJ: Wiley Blackwell; Carr, K., Wang, T.R., Forgiveness isn’t a simple process: It’s a vast undertaking”: Negotiating and communicating forgiveness in nonvoluntary family relationships (2012) Journal of Family Communication, 12, pp. 40-56; Conger, R.D., Elder, G.H., Jr., (1994) Families in troubled times: Adapting to change in rural America, , 1st ed., New York, NY: Aldine De Gruyter; Conger, R.D., Elder, G.H., Jr., Lorenz, F.O., Conger, K.J., Simons, R.L., Whitbeck, L.B., Melby, J.N., Linking economic hardship to marital quality and instability (1990) Journal of Marriage and the Family, 52, pp. 634-656; Dew, M.A., Penkower, L., Bromet, E.J., Effects of unemployment on mental health in the contemporary family (1991) Behavior Modification, 15, pp. 501-544; DiCioccio, R.L., We could sure use a laugh”: Building hope and resilience through humorous communication (2015) Communicating hope and resilience across the lifespan, , Beck G.A., Socha T.J., (eds), New York, NY: Peter Lang; Feather, N.T., Davenport, P.R., Unemployment and depressive affect.

Mismatches between career aspirations and available opportunities can precipitate struggles over the meaning and desirability of an academic career, triggering a need for sensemaking. This article offers an analysis of academic couples’ job search stories, focusing on how they jointly make sense of career events through narrative performances. Using dialogic/performance analysis, the article identifies several specific strategies by which participants collaboratively manage tensions between “self” and “other” and sustain positive identities. These strategies include bolstering the partner’s image through protective teamwork, minimizing status differences, and re-storying professional setbacks. Together, these strategies show how couples strive to make their experiences sensible to themselves and others and to forge new meanings of career passages that, in many cases, depart from established models. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.",,,,,,,,,,"Acker, J., Gendered organizations and intersectionality: Problems and possibilities (2012) Equality, Diversity and Inclusion: An International Journal, 31, pp. 214-224; Alvesson, M., Ashcraft, K.L., Thomas, R., Identity matters: Reflections on the construction of identity scholarship in organization studies (2008) Organization, 15, pp. 5-28; Bagilhole, B., Goode, J., The contradiction of the myth of individual merit, and the reality of a patriarchal support system in academic careers: A feminist investigation (2001) European Journal of Women’s Studies, 8, pp. 161-180; Bellah, R., Madsen, W., Swidler, A., Tipton, S., (1985) Habits of the heart: Individualism and commitment in American life, , Berkeley, CA: University of California Press; Benson, A., Rethinking the two-body problem: The segregation of women into geographically dispersed occupations (2014) Demography, 51, pp. 1619-1639; Bergen, K.M., Accounting for difference: Commuter wives and the master narrative of marriage (2010) Journal of Applied Communication Research, 38, pp. 47-64; Berger, P., Kellner, H., Marriage and the construction of reality (1964) Diogenes, 46, pp. 1-23; Bicks, C., Is the husband going to be a problem?

This study extends family communication patterns theory (FCP) by examining whether communicative relationship maintenance plays a role in the relationship between FCP and sibling relationship satisfaction. Data from 327 adult siblings from across the United States tested using Hayes (2013) PROCESS revealed that conversation and conformity orientation had positive indirect effects on sibling relationship satisfaction through both (a) relational maintenance expectations and (b) perceptions of sibling actual maintenance behavior in nearly all models (i.e., including positivity, openness, assurances, networks, and tasks maintenance behaviors). The results suggest that the parent-child relationship remains important long after children become adults as it continues to influence interpersonal relationships with others. Future directions for communication scholars are discussed along with theoretical implications for research on family communication patterns and the maintenance strategy framework. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.",,,,,,,,,,"Baxter, L.A., Pederson, J.R., Perceived and ideal family communication patterns and family satisfaction for parents and their college-aged children (2013) Journal of Family Communication, 13, pp. 132-149; Baxter, L.A., Wilmot, W.W., Secret tests (1984) Human Communication Research, 11, pp. 171-201; Bridge, M.C., Schrodt, P., Privacy orientations as a function of family communication patterns (2013) Communication Reports, 26, pp. 1-12; Brown, J., Steele, J., Walsh-Childers, K., Sexual teens (2002) Sexual media: Investigating media’s influences on adolescent sexuality, , Mahwah, NJ: Erlbaum; Burgoon, J.K., Interpersonal expectations, expectancy violations, and emotional communication (1993) Journal of Language and Social Psychology, 12, pp. 30-48; Canary, D.J., Stafford, L., Relational maintenance strategies and equity in marriage (1992) Communication Monographs, 59, pp. 243-267; Canary, D.J., Stafford, L., Hause, K., Wallace, L., An inductive analysis of relational maintenance strategies: A comparison among lovers, relatives, friends, and others (1993) Communication Research Reports, 10, pp. 5-14; Canary, D.J., Stafford, L., Semic, B.A., A panel study of the associations between maintenance strategies and relational characteristics (2002) Journal of Marriage and Family, 64, pp. 395-406; Cicirelli, V.G., Sibling relationships in adulthood (1991) Marriage and Family Review, 16, pp. 291-310; Dainton, M., Maintenance behaviors, expectations for maintenance, and satisfaction: Linking comparison levels to relational maintenance strategies (2000) Journal of Social and Personal Relationships, 17, pp. 827-842; Dindia, K., Definitions and perspectives on relational maintenance communication (2003) Maintaining relationships through communication: Relational, contextual, and cultural variations, , Canary D.J., Dainton M., (eds), Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum; Fitzpatrick, M.A., Family communication patterns theory: Observations on its development and application (2004) Journal of Family Communication, 4, pp. 167-179; Goodboy, A.K., Myers, S.A., Patterson, B.R., Investigating elderly sibling types, relational maintenance, and lifespan affect, cognition, and behavior (2009) Atlantic Journal of Communication, 17, pp. 140-148; Goodman, J.K., Cryder, C.E., Cheema, A., Data collection in a flat world: The strengths and weaknesses of Mechanical Turk samples (2012) Journal of Behavioral Decision Making, 26, pp. 213-224; Hayes, A.F., (2013) Introduction to mediation, moderation, and conditional process analysis: A regression-based approach, , New York, NY: Guilford; Hendrick, S.S., A generic measure of relationship satisfaction (1988) Journal of Marriage and the Family, 50, pp. 93-98; Johnson, A., Examining the maintenance of friendships: Are there differences between geographically close and long-distance friends?

Thus, the goal of this study is to explore how relationships within the elderly immigrant’s family are manifested in a home computer context and to determine the roles that domestication of the relevant technologies plays in their family life. This qualitative study is based on in-depth interviews with 26 elderly users who immigrated from the Former Soviet Union (FSU) to Israel about 20 years ago. The findings show that ICT domestication and family dynamics are complex, interrelated processes: Technologies have dramatically changed the elderly immigrants’ family situations, yet immigrants have accorded these technologies unique meaning, adapting them to respond to their family needs and negotiating ICT domestication as a means of discussing and rebuilding family communication. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.",,,,,,,,,,"Albertini, M., Kohli, M., Vogel, C., Intergenerational transfers of time and money in European families: Common patterns-different regimes?

Using a college student sample, the results largely supported the predicted model in terms of both direct and indirect effects. Specifically, both family communication patterns were significantly related to alexithymia, while alexithymia was significantly related to the latent constructs of destructive, avoidant, and rival focused responses to jealousy. Indirect effects were also found between both family communication patterns and all four latent constructs of communicative responses to jealousy. Finally, the family communication patterns also interacted to predict alexithymia.

Analysis of over 70 message board postings retrieved from online support groups revealed two main discursive struggles that characterize siblings’ experiences of grief and loss: grieving as deviant behavior versus grieving as a normal process and the deceased as gone forever versus the deceased as still present. These findings illuminate the challenges bereaved siblings face as they attempt to mourn their deceased brother or sister and make sense of their grief within a societal context that oftentimes forgets or overlooks how traumatic it can be to lose a sibling. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.",,,,,,,,,,"Aho, A.L., Paavilainen, E., Kaunonen, M., Mothers’ experiences of peer support via an Internet discussion forum after the death of a child (2012) Scandinavian Journal of Caring Sciences, 26, pp. 417-426; Bakhtin, M.M., (1984) Problems of Dostoevsky’s poetics, , (C.

Origin stories, representing the formation of a family, are culturally understood within a master narrative of heterosexual love and biological childbearing. Beginnings of co-mother families rupture this dominant, gendered, boy-meets-girl script. Investigating whether or not co-mother stories reify the normative master narrative or if instead their narrations resist and/or possibly transform conventional understandings, analysis identified three co-mother origin story themes: Becoming a Family (1) as Normal, (2) as Negotiation, and (3) as Normalization. Themes differ in terms of depiction of co-mother family formation as congruent with current norms, as something that needs to be made to seem normal (i.e., in need of normalization), or as something between normal and normalization—to be negotiated internally within the couple. Study results are discussed within a broader framework of family coming-together stories. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.",,,,,,,"American Psychological Foundation, APF","The current project was supported by an American Psychological Foundation Early Investigator Award and was presented at the National Communication Association convention (November 2015, Las Vegas) in the Family Communication Division.",,"Ausbrooks, A.R., Russell, A., Gay and lesbian family building: A strengths perspective of transracial adoption (2011) Journal of GLBT Family Studies, 7, pp. 201-216; Averett, P.E., Hegde, A., School social work and early childhood student’s attitudes toward gay and lesbian families (2012) Teaching in Higher Education, 17, pp. 537-549; Baxter, L.A., (2014) Remaking “family” communicatively, , New York, NY: Peter Lang; Baxter, L.A., Norwood, K., Asbury, B., Scharp, K.M., Narrating adoption: Resisting adoption as “second best” in online stories of domestic adoption told by adoptive parents (2014) Journal of Family Communication, 14, pp. 253-269; Baxter, L.A., Suter, E.A., Thomas, L.J., Seurer, L.M., The dialogic construction of “adoption” in online foster adoption narratives (2015) Journal of Family Communication, 15, pp. 193-213; Bergen, K.M., Suter, E.A., Daas, K.L., About as solid as a fishnet”: Symbolic construction of a legitimate parental identity for nonbiological lesbian mothers (2006) Journal of Family Communication, 6, pp. 201-220; Biblarz, T.J., Savci, E., Lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender families (2010) Journal of Marriage and Family, 72, pp. 480-497; Bochner, A.P., Ellis, C., Tillman-Healy, L.M., Relationships as stories (1997) Handbook of personal relationships: Theory, research and interventions, , Duck S., (ed), 2nd ed., New York, NY: John Wiley & Sons; Braun, V., Clarke, V., Using thematic analysis in psychology (2006) Qualitative Research in Psychology, 3, pp. 77-101; Breshears, D., Understanding communication between lesbian parents and their children regarding outsider discourse about family identity (2011) Journal of GLBT Family Studies, 7, pp. 264-284; Breshears, D., Braithwaite, D.O., Discursive struggles animating individuals’ talk about their parents’ coming out as lesbian or gay (2014) Journal of Family Communication, 14, pp. 189-207; Broad, K.L., Alden, H., Berkowitz, D., Ryan, M., Activist parenting and GLBTQ families (2008) Journal of GLBT Family Studies, 4, pp. 499-520; Brooks, D., Goldberg, S., Gay and lesbian adoptive and foster care placements: Can they meet the needs of waiting children?

We employ communication privacy management theory to examine how bereaved individuals manage the revelation and concealment of private information about the death of a parent or sibling. In-depth interviews (N = 21) with the bereaved indicate that (a) they conceptualize information surrounding the death and their grief as private, (b) they create rules to govern their private information, and (c) violations of those rules result in turbulence. Specifically, individuals employ selectivity, avoidance, and positivity rules that dictate what and with whom they share. We discuss the implications of our findings on grief communication scholarship, CPM theory, and practical issues for helping bereaved individuals and their loved ones navigate discussions about death and the deceased. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.",,,,,,,,,,"Afifi, T.D., ‘Feeling caught’ in stepfamilies: Managing boundary turbulence through appropriate communication privacy rules (2003) Journal of Social and Personal Relationships, 20, pp. 729-755;

Data were collected from parents of adolescents ages 10–18 in two countries, the United States (US) and the Netherlands. Results indicated significant differences between the two samples. Specifically, American parents reported more concern about adolescent social media use, more positive attitudes and perceived subjective norms to control adolescent use, and higher levels of active and restrictive mediation. In general, demographics and parental concern accounted for more explained variance in mediation behaviors among Dutch parents, and the TPB-based variables accounted for more explained variance among American parents. Results suggest important implications for the integration of different theoretical models to explain parent mediation behavior. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.",,,,,,,,,,"Ajzen, I., The theory of planned behavior (1991) Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes, 50, pp. 179-211; Ajzen, I., (2005) Attitudes, personality, and behavior, , 2nd ed., Berkshire, UK: McGraw Hill International; Andeweg, R.B., Irwin, G.A., (2002) Government and politics of the Netherlands, , New York, NY: Palgrave; Barnes, S.B., A privacy paradox: Social networking in the United States (2006) First Monday, 11; boyd, D.M., Hargittai, E., Connected and concerned: Variation in parents’ online safety concerns (2013) Policy & Internet, 5, pp. 245-269; Brandtzæg, P.B., Staksrud, E., Hagen, I., Wold, T., Norwegian children’s experiences of cyberbullying when using different technological platforms (2009) Journal of Children and Media, 3, pp. 349-365; Brown, D., Hayes, T., Family attitudes toward television (2001) Television and the American family, , Bryant J., Bryant J.A., (eds), 2nd ed., Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates; Bybee, C.R., Robinson, D., Turow, J., Determinants of parental guidance of children’s television viewing for a special subgroup: Mass media scholars (1982) Journal of Broadcasting, 26, pp. 697-710; Cialdini, R.B., Reno, R.R., Kallgren, C.A., A focus theory of normative conduct: Recycling the concept of norms to reduce littering in public places (1990) Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 58, pp. 1015-1026; Cingel, D.P., Krcmar, M., Predicting media use in very young children: The role of demographics and parent attitudes (2013) Communication Studies, 64, pp. 374-394; Correa, T., Hinsley, A.W., De Zúñiga, H.G., Who interacts on the Web?: The intersection of users’ personality and social media use (2010) Computers in Human Behavior, 26, pp. 247-253; Darling, N., Steinberg, L., Parenting style as context: An integrative model (1993) Psychological Bulletin, 113, pp. 487-496; Duerager, A., Livingstone, S., (2012) How can parents support children’s Internet safety?, , http://www2.lse.ac.uk/media@lse/research/EUKidsOnline/Home.aspx; Erdur-Baker, O., Cyberbullying and its correlation to traditional bullying, gender, and frequent and risky usage of Internet-mediated communication tools (2010) New Media & Society, 12, pp. 109-125; Harakeh, Z., Scholte, R.H.J., Vermulst, A.A., de Vries, H., Engels, R.C.M.E., Parental factors and adolescents’ smoking behavior: An extension of the theory of planned behavior (2004) Preventative Medicine, 39, pp. 951-961; Harkness, S., Super, C.M., Themes and variations: Parental ethnotheories in Western cultures (2004) Parental beliefs, parenting, and child development in cross-cultural perspective, , Rubin K., (ed), New York, NY: Psychology Press; Hasebrink, U., Livingstone, S., Haddon, L., Ólafsson, K., (2009) Comparing children’s online opportunities and risks across Europe: Cross-national comparisons for EU kids online, , London, UK: LSE, EU Kids Online; Hoffner, C., Buchanan, M., Parents’ responses to television violence: The third person perception, parental mediation, and support for censorship (2002) Media Psychology, 4, pp. 231-252; Kotler, J.A., (1999) Children’s television use and parental regulation: An interactive systems analysis, , Unpublished doctoral dissertation, University of Texas – Austin, Austin, Texas, USA; Lapinski, M.K., Rimal, R.M., An explication of social norms (2005) Communication Theory, 15, pp. 127-147; Lenhart, A., (2015) Teens, social media, and technology overview 2015, , Washington, DC: Pew American Life & Internet Project; Liau, K.L., Khoo, A., Ang, P.H., Parental awareness and monitoring of adolescent Internet use (2005) Current Psychology, 27, pp. 217-233; Livingstone, S., Haddon, L., Görzig, A., Ólafsson, K., (2011) Risks and safety on the Internet: The perspective of European children.

Specifically, we tested the assumption that FCP (i.e., conversation and conformity orientation) serve as a backdrop for adoption communication openness and adoptive identity work. Structural equation modeling revealed that conversation orientation—but not conformity orientation—significantly predicted adoptive parents’ communicated openness about adoption. Adoption communication openness negatively predicted adoptees’ preoccupation with adoption. Indirect paths between conversation orientation, adoption communication openness, and adoptive identity and self-esteem illuminated the importance of the general communication environment on adoption outcomes. Implications are explored for expanding understanding of adoptive family communication and advancing FCP theory by testing its nature as a context-specific and/or global assessment of family communication. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.",,,,,,,,,,"Baxter, L.A., Akkoor, C., Topic expansiveness and family communication patterns (2011) Journal of Family Communication, 11, pp. 1-20; Brodzinsky, D.M., Long-term outcomes in adoption (1993) The Future of Children, 3, pp. 153-166; Brodzinsky, D.M., Family structural openness and communication openness as predictors in the adjustment of adopted children (2006) Adoption Quarterly, 9, pp. 1-18; Brodzinsky, D.M., Schechter, M.D., Henig, R.M., (1992) Being adopted: The lifelong search for self, , New York, NY: Anchor Books; Colaner, C.W., Measuring adoptive identity: Validation of the adoptive identity work scale (2014) Adoption Quarterly, 17, pp. 134-157; Colaner, C.W., Halliwell, D., Guignon, P., What do you say to your mother when your mother’s standing beside you?” Birth and adoptive family contributions to adoptive identity via relational identity and relational-relational identity gaps (2014) Communication Monographs, 81, pp. 469-494; Colaner, C.W., Kranstuber, H., Forever kind of wondering”: Communicatively managing uncertainty in adoptive families (2010) Journal of Family Communication, 10, pp. 236-255; Colaner, C.W., Soliz, J., A communication-based approach to adoptive identity: Theoretical and empirical support (2015) Communication Research, , [advanced online publication]; Donahue, E.A., (2008) Open communication in adoption and adoptive identity development, , Unpublished dissertation, Long Island University, New York, New York:; Dunbar, N., Grotevant, H.D., Adoption narratives: The construction of adoptive identity during adolescence (2004) Family stories and the life course: Across time and generations, , Pratt M.W., Fiese B.H., (eds), Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum; Enders, C.K., (2010) Applied missing data analysis (Methodology in the social sciences series), , New York, NY: Guilford; Erikson, E.H., (1968) Identity: Youth and crisis, , New York, NY: WW Norton & Company; Freeark, K., Rosenblum, K.L., Hus, V.H., Root, B.L., Fathers, mothers and marriages: What shapes adoption conversations in families with young adopted children?

This study aims to explicate what prompts these conversations and what prevents them from happening more often. A nationally representative, random sample of U.S. mothers and fathers was surveyed (N = 186). Participants reported that thinking their child is too young, regardless of the child’s age, was a major communication barrier, while communication self-efficacy and perceived value in sexual communication were associated with more communication. Sexual communication was often prompted by the child, or the parent deciding the child was “old enough,” and was rarely prompted by a family member or healthcare provider.

Semistructured, one-to-one interviews were conducted with Chinese adolescents (N = 37) about their parents’ communication about sex and sexuality. Using a constant comparative method, four categories were identified with respect to Chinese parents’ direct/explicit communication about sexuality and in addition, four categories of indirect/implication communication (RQ1). Further, four categories regarding Chinese adolescents’ attitudes towards such communication were apparent (RQ2). Overall, Chinese parents attempted to transmit values and expectations about dating and sexual activities indirectly, implicitly, and/or nonverbally. Adolescents in the present study also expressed tendencies to avoid sex-related communication with parents. Some even explicitly stated that avoiding such communication was beneficial. The findings’ implications for the role of culture in parent-adolescent communication about sexuality and communication openness are discussed. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.",,,,,,,,,,"Afifi, T.D., Joseph, A., Aldeis, D., Why can’t we just talk about it?

Data were collected from family triads (N = 286), including a mother, a child, and a sibling. Mothers and their adult children completed measures of depression, loneliness, and self-esteem. The assessment of the maternal interaction variables (i.e., maternal care and maternal control) involved the perspectives of a sibling to minimize common method variance. Results partially supported the hypothesized model, wherein maternal care (but not maternal control) mediated the relationship between mothers’ depression, loneliness, and self-esteem to that of their children. Specifically, mothers who reported higher levels of psychosocial problems had children who reported that their mothers were less caring and, in turn, less maternal care was associated with higher levels of psychosocial problems in their young adult children. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.",,,,,,,,,,"Abelson, R.P., A variance explanation paradox: When a little is a lot (1985) Psychological Bulletin, 97, pp. 129-133; Ackard, D.M., Neumark-Sztainer, D., Story, M., Perry, C., Parent-child connectedness and behavioral and emotional health among adolescents (2006) American Journal of Preventive Medicine, 30, pp. 59-66; Arnold, L.B., Doran, E., Stop before you hurt the kids: Communicating self-control and self-negation in femininity, mothering, and eating disorders (2007) Women’s Studies in Communication, 30, pp. 310-339; Arroyo, A., Nevarez, N., Segrin, C., Harwood, J., The association between parent and adult child shyness, social skills, and perceived family communication environment (2012) Journal of Family Communication, 12, pp. 249-264; Bahreini, M., Akaberian, S., Ghodsbin, F., Yazdankhah Fard, M.R., Mohammadi Baghmollaei, M., The effects of parental bonding on depression and self esteem in adolescence (2012) Journal of Jahrom University of Medical Sciences, 10, pp. 6-10; Bandura, A., (1977) Social learning theory, , New York, NY: General Learning Press; Baxter, J., Patterns of change and stability in the gender division of household labour in Australia, 1986-1997 (2002) Journal of Sociology, 38, pp. 399-424; Bean, R.A., Northrup, J.C., Parental psychological control, psychological autonomy, and acceptance as predictors of self-esteem in Latino adolescents (2009) Journal of Family Issues, 30, pp. 1486-1504; Beardslee, W.R., Versage, E.M., Gladstone, T.R., Children of affectively ill parents: A review of the past 10 years (1998) Journal of the American Academy of Child & Adolescent Psychiatry, 37, pp. 1134-1141; Behzadi, B., Parker, G., A Persian version of the parental bonding instrument: Factor structure and psychometric properties (2015) Psychiatry Research, 225, pp. 580-587; Bifulco, A., Moran, P.M., Ball, C., Jacobs, C., Baines, R., Bunn, A., Cavagin, J., Childhood adversity, parental vulnerability and disorder: Examining inter-generational transmission of risk (2002) Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry, 43 (8), pp. 1075-1086; Boomsma, D.I., Cacioppo, J.T., Muthén, B., Asparouhov, T., Clark, S., Longitudinal genetic analysis for loneliness in Dutch twins (2007) Twin Research and Human Genetics, 10, pp. 267-273; Borelli, J., David, D., Crowley, M., Mayes, L., Links between disorganized attachment classification and clinical symptoms in school-aged children (2010) Journal of Child & Family Studies, 19, pp. 243-256; Bowen, M., (1978) Family therapy in clinical practice, , New York, NY: Aronson; Bowlby, J., (1969) Attachment and loss: Vol. 1 Attachment, , London, England: Pimlico; Bredemeier, K., Berenbaum, H., Brockmole, J.R., Boot, W.R., Simons, D.J., Most, S.B., A load on my mind: Evidence that anhedonic depression is like multi-tasking (2012) Acta Psychologica, 139, pp. 137-145; Burke, T.J., Woszidlo, A., Segrin, C., The intergenerational transmission of social skills and psychosocial problems among parents and their young adult children (2013) Journal of Family Communication, 13, pp. 77-91; Burt, K.B., Van Dulmen, M.H.M., Carlivati, J.E., Byron, S.L.A., Forman, D.R., Sroufe, L.A., Carlson, E.A., Mediating links between maternal depression and offspring psychopathology: The importance of independent data (2005) Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry, 46, pp. 490-499; Christensen, A., Margolin, G., Conflict and alliance in distressed and nondistressed families (1988) Relationships within families: Mutual influences, , Hinde R.A., Stevenson-Hinde J., (eds), Oxford, UK: Oxford University Press; Coplan, R.J., Arbeau, K.A., Armer, M., Don’t fret, be supportive!

Prior research suggests that alcoholism can negatively impact the nature and quality of family relations, but studies rarely consider the specific ways in which family communication dynamics are impacted by the disease. Thus, the goal of this study was to identify the characteristics of communication in families of alcoholics and to develop a larger conceptual model to guide future inquiries in this context. A national sample of 682 adult children of alcoholics were asked to describe the communication dynamics in their family of origin. A theme analysis of the open-ended data revealed four overarching themes that were comprised of nine subcategories: (a) aggressive communication (e.g., heightened conflict, tense communication, and secretive slandering); (b) protective communication (e.g., superficiality, limited or indirect communication, and sober parent buffering); (c) adaptive communication (e.g., functional communication); and, (d) inconsistent communication (e.g., struggles over power and control, mood fluctuation). We draw on the results of this analysis to propose a model depicting communication dynamics in families of alcoholics and the antecedent conditions and consequent outcomes of such communication patterns in the family. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.",,,,,,,,,,"Ackerman, R.J., (1986) Growing in the shadow: Children of alcoholic, , Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Health Communications;

Interviews with 19 parents of children, teens, and adults with mild, moderate, and severe autism highlighted the discursive construction of family identity. Findings reveal that families construct an internal family identity that is marked by unified usage of the name “autism,” emotive and mundane daily discussions, narratives that serve functional purposes, and normal/structured rituals. Externally, families communicate about autism to outsiders to help others understand, to educate others about autism, to show their loyalty and protection for their family, and to highlight their family’s normalcy. These findings illustrate that the discourse-dependent practices are useful not just for constructing membership in families that differ structurally from societal expectations, but also for constructing identity in that face of unique family functioning resulting from a chronic health concern. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.",,,,,,,,,,"Ashcraft, K.L., Mumby, D.K., (2004) Reworking gender: A feminist communicology of organizatio, , Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage; More information about symptoms of autis (2014) About autism-Autism Speak, , http://www.autismspeaks.org/sites/default/files/sctk_about_autism.pdf, Retrieved, from; Baines, A.D., Positioning, strategizing, and charming: How students with autism construct identities in relation to disabilit (2012) Disability & Societ, 27, pp. 547-561; Baxter, L.A., Introduction to the volum (2014) Remaking “family” communicativel, , Baxter L.A., (ed), New York, NY: Peter Lang; Baxter, L.A., Babbie, E., (2004) The basics of communication researc, , Belmont, CA: Wadsworth; Baxter, L.A., Braithwaite, D.O., Golish, T.D., Olson, L.N., Contradictions of interaction for wives of husbands with adult dementi (2002) Journal of Applied Communication Researc, 29, pp. 221-247; Berger, P.L., Luckmann, T., (1967) The social construction of reality: A treatise in the sociology of knowledg, , Garden City, NY: Anchor; Braithwaite, D.O., Toller, P.W., Daas, K.L., Durham, W.T., Jones, A.C., Centered but not caught in the middle: Stepchildren’s perceptions of dialectical contradictions in the communication of co-parent (2008) Journal of Applied Communication Researc, 36, pp. 33-55; Bristol, M., Family resources and successful adaptation to autistic childre (1984) The effects of autism on the famil, , Schopler E., Mesibov G., (eds), New York, NY: Plenum Press; Bruess, C.J., Pearson, J.C., The function of mundane ritualizing in adult friendship and marriag (2002) Communication Research Report, 19, pp. 314-326; Canary, H.E., Negotiating dis/ability in families: Constructions and contradiction (2008) Journal of Applied Communication Researc, 36, pp. 437-458; Canary, H.E., Children with invisible disabilities: Communicating to manage family contradictio (2012) Effective family communication for coping with crise, , Webb L.M., Dickson F.C., (eds), New York, NY: Peter Lang; Canitano, R., Self injurious behavior in autism: Clinical aspects and treatment with risperidon (2006) Journal of Neural Transmissio, 113, pp. 425-431; Data and statistic (2015) Autism spectrum disorder, , http://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/autism/data.html, Retrieved, February, 2015, from; Colaner, C.W., Kranstuber, H., Forever kind of wondering”: Communicatively managing uncertainty in adoptive familie (2010) Journal of Family Communicatio, 10, pp. 236-255; Creswell, J.W., (2007) Qualitative inquiry and research design: Choosing among five tradition, , 2nd ed., Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage; Fitch, K.L., Criteria for evidence in qualitative researc (1994) Western Journal of Communicatio, 58, pp. 32-38; Galvin, K., Diversity’s impact on defining the famil (2006) The family communication sourceboo, , Turner L.H., West R., (eds), Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage; Galvin, K., The family of the future: What do we face (2013) The handbook of family communicatio, , Vangelisti A.L., (ed), 2nd ed., Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum; Galvin, K., Blood, law, and discourse: Constructing and managing family identit (2014) Remaking “family” communicativel, , Baxter L.A., (ed), New York, NY: Peter Lang; Ganong, L.H., Coleman, M., (1994) Remarried family relationship, , Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage; Gergen, K.J., Hoffman, L., Anderson, H., Is diagnosis a disaster?

Results of content analyses revealed a variety of changes to communication during deployment (RQ1), challenges of reunion (RQ2), benefits of deployment (RQ3), and advice for reintegration (RQ4).

Interviews (N = 30) with young adult-family member dyads supported this assertion. Interview data illustrated that mothers struggled to fulfill incongruous health goals for themselves and their family members, and did so at the expense of their familial relationships (particularly with children) and their own health. Moreover, dyadic data analysis highlighted how young adults ascertained and carried on the “tradition” of the established mother-as-healthcare-provider role.

Participants included 199 mother-daughter dyads that completed online questionnaires containing measures of fat talk, old talk, body dissatisfaction, body surveillance, drive for thinness, and bulimic tendencies. Actor-partner interdependence models revealed that (a) mothers’ and daughters’ fat talk, but not old talk, were significantly related to one another, (b) mothers’ and daughters’ fat talk and old talk were significantly related to their own body image outcomes, (c) mothers’ fat talk was positively related to daughters’ bulimic tendencies, and (d) mothers’ old talk was positively related to daughters’ body dissatisfaction. These results suggest that engaging in appearance-related communication is problematic for the person making the comments and, to some extent, being exposed to another person’s appearance-related comments can be harmful to the individual as well—at least for the daughters in the current sample. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.",,,,,,,,,,"Al Sabbah, H., Vereecken, C.A., Elgar, F.J., Nansel, T., Aasvee, K., Abdeen, Z., Maes, L., Body weight dissatisfaction and communication with parents among adolescents in 24 countries: International cross-sectional surve (2009) BMC Public Healt, 9, pp. 52-62; Arroyo, A., Connecting theory to fat talk: Body dissatisfaction mediates the relationships between weight discrepancy, upward comparison, body surveillance, and fat tal (2014) Body Image: An International Journal of Researc, 11, pp. 303-306; Arroyo, A., Harwood, J., Exploring the causes and consequences of engaging in fat tal (2012) Journal of Applied Communication Researc, 40, pp. 167-187; Arroyo, A., Segrin, C., Harwood, J., Appearance-related communication mediates the link between self-objectification and health and well-being outcome (2014) Human Communication Researc, 40, pp. 463-482; Bäck, E.A., Effects of parental relations and upbringing in troubled adolescent eating behavior (2011) Eating Disorder, 19, pp. 403-424; Bandura, A., (1977) Social learning theor, , New York, NY: General Learning Press; Bandura, A., Social cognitive theory of mass communicatio (2009) Mediapsycholog, 3, pp. 265-299; Becker, C.B., Diedrichs, P.C., Jankowski, G., Werchan, C., I’m not just fat, I’m old: Has the study of body image overlooked “old talk” (2013) Journal of Eating Disorder, 1, pp. 6-12; Bem, D.J., Self-perception theor (1972) Advances in experimental social psycholog, , Berkowitz L., (ed), New York, NY: Academic Press; Benninghoven, D., Tetsch, N., Kunzendorf, S., Jantschek, G., Perceptual body image of patients with anorexia or bulimia nervosa and their father (2007) Eating and Weight Disorders - Studies on Anorexia, Bulimia and Obesit, 12, pp. 12-19; Blumer, H., (1969) Symbolic interactionism: Perspective and metho, , Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice-Hall; Bradley, D.E., Longino, C.F., How older people think about images of aging in advertising and the medi (2001) Generations – Journal of the American Society on Agin, 25, pp. 17-21; Britton, L.E., Martz, D.M., Bazzini, D.G., Curtin, L.A., LeaShomb, A., Fat talk and self-presentation of body image: Is there a social norm for women to self-degrade (2006) Body Image: An International Journal of Researc, 3, pp. 247-254; Clarke, L.H., Griffin, M., Becoming and being gendered through the body: Older women, their mothers and body imag (2007) Ageing & Societ, 27, pp. 701-718; Clarke, P.M., Murnen, S.K., Smolak, L., Development and psychometric evaluation of a quantitative measure of “fat tal (2010) Body Imag, 7, pp. 1-7; (2015), http://money.cnn.com/2015/03/10/technology/feeling-fat-facebook/, retrieved, March, 2015; Cooley, E., Toray, T., Wang, M.C., Valdez, N.N., Maternal effects on daughters’ eating pathology and body imag (2008) Eating Behavior, 9, pp. 52-61; Corning, A.F., Bucchianeri, M.M., Pick, C.M., Thin or overweight women’s fat talk: Which is worse for other women’s body satisfaction (2014) Eating Disorders: The Journal of Treatment and Preventio, 22, pp. 121-135; Corning, A.F., Gondoli, D.M., Who is most likely to fat talk?

This autoethnography explores one turning point that occurred between the author and his father when they experienced the death of a mutual friend. This event became the catalyst in the relationship, which the author illustrates through narrative vignettes to show the struggles that exist, and highlights a view on father–son relationships and masculinities that challenges masculine norms in order to (re)create a valued relationship. The goal of this narrative is to offer an opportunity for others to reflect on identity, relationships, and masculinities in their own experiences and relationships. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.",,,,,,,,,,"Adams, T.E., Seeking father: Relationally reframing a troubled love story (2006) Qualitative Inquiry, 12, pp. 704-723; Adams, T.E., Holman-Jones, S., Telling stories: Reflexivity, queer theory, and autoethnography (2011) Cultural Studies ↔ Critical Methodologies, 11, pp. 108-116; Anonymous, S.F., Father figuring: An autoethnography of fatherhood (2015) Qualitative Inquiry, 21, pp. 11-19; Baxter, L.A., Braithwaite, D.O., Nicholson, J.H., Turning points in the development of blended families (1999) Journal of Social and Personal Relationships, 16, pp. 291-314; Baxter, L.A., Bullis, C., Turning points in developing romantic relationships (1986) Human Communication Research, 18, pp. 336-363; Berry, K., Spinning autoethnographic reflexivity, cultural critique, and negotiating selves (2013) Handbook of autoethnography, pp. 209-227. , Holman Jones S., Adams T.E., Ellis C., (eds), Walnut Creek, CA: Left Coast Press; Berry, K., Clair, R.P., Contestation and opportunity in reflexivity: An introduction (2011) Cultural Studies ↔ Critical Methodologies, 11, pp. 95-97; Beynon, J., (2002) Masculinities and culture, , Philadelphia, PA: Open University Press; Bochner, A.P., Fathers and sons (2008) Qualitative Inquiry, 14, pp. 1321-1328; Brod, H., Kaufman, M., (1994) Theorizing masculinities, , Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage; Brotherson, S.E., Acock, A.C., Yamamoto, T., Connection and communication in father-child relationships and adolescent child wellbeing (2003) Fathering, 1, pp. 191-214; Connell, R.W., (1995) Masculinities, , Cambridge, UK: Polity; (2005), http://www.nova.edu/ssss/QR/QR10-3/davis.pdf, Davis, S.

They convey and analyze two narratives that illustrate salient ways bullying happens within families, and describe how the relational practices of understanding, dialogue, and forgiveness inform such aggression. This inquiry provokes the reconsideration of normative ways of conceptualizing the family, primarily by proposing a more voluntary orientation to familial relationships. The authors also advocate for more research to be conducted on bullying and family communication, and why autoethnography is a compelling method to use for this research. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.",,,,,,,,,,"Adams, T.E., Seeking father: Relationally reframing a troubled love story (2006) Qualitative Inquiry, 12, pp. 704-723; Adams, T.E., (2011) Narrating the closet: An autoethnography of same-sex attraction, , Walnut Creek, CA: Left Coast Press; Adams, T.E., Missing each other (2012) Qualitative Inquiry, 18, pp. 193-196; Adams, T.E., Post-coming out complications (2014) Critical autoethnography: Intersecting cultural identities in everyday life, pp. 50-61. , Boylorn R.M., Orbe M.P., (eds), Walnut Creek, CA: Left Coast Press; Adams, T.E., Holman Jones, S., Ellis, C., (2015) Autoethnography, , New York, NY: Oxford University Press; Adams, T.E., Manning, J., Autoethnography and family research (2015) Journal of Family Theory & Review, 7, pp. 350-366; Agllias, K., Difference, choice, and punishment: Parental beliefs and understandings about adult child estrangement (2015) Australian Social Work, 68, pp. 115-129; Agllias, K.B., Family estrangement (2013) Encyclopedia of social work, , 20th, New York, NY: National Association of Social Workers and Oxford University Press; Anderson, R., Baxter, L.A., Cissna, K.N., (2004) Dialogue: Theorizing difference in communication studies, , Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage; Baxter, L.A., Asbury, B., Critical approaches to interpersonal communication: Charting a future (2015) Engaging theories in interpersonal communication: Multiple perspectives, pp. 189-201. , Braithwaite D.O., Schrodt P., (eds), Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage; Berry, J., Magee, P., We could all have done what the other did (2015) The forgiveness project: Stories for a vengeful age, pp. 78-81. , Cantacuzino M., (ed), London, UK: Jessica Kingsley; Berry, K., Reconciling the relational echoes of addiction: Holding on (2012) Qualitative Inquiry, 18, pp. 134-143; Berry, K., Bullied: Tales of torment, identity, and youth, , in press, Walnut Grove, CA: Left Coast Press; Berry, K., Patti, C.J., Lost in narration: Applying autoethnography (2015) Journal of Applied Communication Research, 43, pp. 263-268; Bochner, A.P., Bird on the wire: Freeing the father within me (2012) Qualitative Inquiry, 18, pp. 168-173; Bochner, A.P., Epilogue: On family communication’s search for meaning (2015) The SAGE handbook of family communication, pp. 417-425. , Turner L.H., West R., (eds), Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage; Bond, L., Carlin, J.B., Thomas, L., Rubin, K., Patton, G., Does bullying cause emotional problems?

Specifically, this study explores the ways in which the parent–child relationship is constructed in 52 narrative interviews with adult children who are estranged from their parent(s). Contrapuntal analysis revealed that two discourses compete to illuminate meanings of the parent–child relationship. Three interrelated themes that emphasize biological connection, familial webs, and shared history constitute the Discourse of Relationship Endurance (DRE). Four interrelated themes that emphasize the need for relational maintenance, care/support, love, and individualism constitute the Discourse of Temporal Contingency and resist the DRE. The competition of these discourses, in the form of diachronic separation, synchronic interplay, and a discursive hybrid coalesce to making meaning of the parent–child relationship and hold implications for both theory and practice. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.",,,,,,,,,,"Agllias, K., No longer on speaking terms: The losses associated with family estrangement at the end of life (2011) Families in Society: The Journal of Contemporary Social Services, 92, pp. 107-113; Agllias, K., The gendered experience of family estrangement in later life (2013) Journal of Women and Social Work, 28, pp. 309-321; Agllias, K., Disconnection and decision-making: Adult children explain their reasons for estranging from parents (2015) Australian Social Work; Bakhtin, M.M., Discourse in the novel (1981) The dialogic imagination: Four essays by M.

Using a critical standpoint, we build on communication work–family/life scholarship to extend theoretical understanding of underlying ideological notions of the good working mother. In particular, we analyze Melanie and Kate’s performances that reflect the underlying cultural ideologies of being an ideal worker, a true domestic woman, and an intensive mother. Further, we explicate how this juggling of identities portrays good working mothers as perpetually defensive. We go beyond the analysis of ideologies to lay out some of the consequences of the performance portrayals of the good working mother, in that she should (a) accept “punishments” from her children, (b) conceptualize fathers as secondary parents, (c) solve problems on her own, and (d) choose family over work. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.",,,,,,,,,,"(2015), http://www.amazon.com/Dont-Know-How-She-Does/dp/B004UXUWOW/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1435771823&sr=8-3&keywords=I+don%27t+know+how+she+does+it, Amazon, Editorial Review of I Don’t Know How She Does It [Amazon.com].

However, little is known about the ways family communication influences how discussions about racial and ethnic differences occur. This study examined associations between observed family communication constructs, including engagement, warmth, and control, and how adoptive families discuss racial and ethnic differences using a sample of families with adolescent-aged children adopted internationally from South Korea (N = 111 families, 222 adolescents). Using data collected during mid-adolescence and again during late adolescence, higher levels of maternal control and positive adolescent engagement were independently associated with a greater likelihood that family members acknowledged the importance of racial and ethnic differences and constructed a multiracial and/or multi-ethnic family identity. Adolescent engagement was also related to a greater likelihood that family members disagreed about the importance of racial and ethnic differences, and did not build a cohesive identity about differences. © 2015, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,"National Institutes of Health, NIH: MH066140, AA011886, MH070740

More specifically, this study utilizes family communication patterns theory and communication privacy management theory to investigate the role of family communication and privacy management in women’s communication about genetic cancer risk with family members. Results found significant direct effects between conversation orientation and both personal and family privacy orientation as well as between conformity orientation and personal privacy orientation. Results also found indirect effects between conversation orientation and communication about genetic cancer risk. Overall this study shows the importance of family communication environment and privacy management in communicating about genetic cancer risk. © 2015, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Afifi, W.A., Weiner, J.L., Toward a theory of motivated information management (2004) Communication Theory, 14, pp. 167-190; Avtgis, T.A., The relationship between unwillingness to communicate and family communication patterns (1999) Communication Research Reports, 16, pp. 333-338; Berger, C.R., Calabrese, R.J., Some explorations in initial interaction and beyond: Toward a developmental theory of interpersonal communication (1975) Human Communication Research, 1, pp. 99-112; Bosch, L.A., Segrin, C., Curran, M.A., Identity style during the transition to adulthood: The role of family communication patterns, perceived support, and affect (2012) Identity: An International Journal of Theory and Research, 12, pp. 275-295; Brashers, D.E., Communication and uncertainty management (2001) Journal of Communication, 51, pp. 477-497; Bridge, M.C., Schrodt, P., Privacy orientations as a function of family communication patterns (2013) Communication Reports, 26, pp. 1-12; Bylund, C.L., Fisher, C.L., Brashers, D., Edgerson, S., Glogowski, E.A., Boyar, S.R., Kissane, D., Sources of uncertainty about daughters’ breast cancer risk that emerge during genetic counseling consultations (2012) Journal of Genetic Counseling, 21, pp. 292-304; Chivers Seymour, K., Addington-Hall, J., Lucassen, A.M., Foster, C.L., What facilitates or impedes family communication following genetic testing for cancer risk?

This study applies communication privacy management (CPM) theory to explore how young adults interact with and manage private information across different generations of their family through Facebook. Overall, 383 young adult participants completed an online survey about online and offline Facebook communication among siblings, parents, and grandparents. Participants interacted with siblings most often through Facebook, followed by parents, and grandparents. The interior family privacy orientation and Facebook privacy management practices significantly predicted variations of online and offline Facebook communication with siblings, parents, and grandparents about social media. The study also examined different types of Facebook socialization messages that young adults conveyed to family members about effective Facebook interactions and ways to preempt privacy breakdowns with their Facebook friends.

Nonverbal cues are studied often for the diverse meanings that can be given to them, and this study reports strong qualitative evidence that nonverbal cues can be understood as performing important communicative functions in this context. These perceived functions were categorized as relational messages, emotional expression, interaction management, social support, and transitioning. Many of the identified functions also had unique subtypes, and these more specific meanings were often associated with particular cues. Together, the findings help reveal the nature of sense-making for nonverbal communication family members recall at the end-of-life and ways in which survivors use that sense-making to find peace with a loved one’s death. © 2015, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Afifi, T.D., McManus, T., Communal coping dilemmas in post-divorce families: Introducing meaning back into coping (2006) Applied interpersonal communication matters: Family, health, and community relations, pp. 67-89. , Dailey R.M., Le Poire B.A., (eds), New York, NY: Peter Lang; Andersen, P.A., Guerrero, L.K., The bright side of relational communication: Interpersonal warmth as a social emotion (1998) Handbook of communication and emotion: Research, theory, applications, and contexts, pp. 303-329. , Andersen P.A., Guerrero L.K., (eds), San Diego, CA: Academic Press; Barber, F.D., Effects of social support on physical activity, self-efficacy, and quality of life in adult cancer survivors and their caregivers (2013) Oncology Nursing Forum, 40, pp. 481-489; Baxter, L.A., Norwood, K., Asbury, B., Jannusch, B., Scharp, K., Narrative coherence in online stories told by family members of the adoptive triad (2012) Journal of Family Communication, 12, pp. 265-283; Boyraz, G., Horne, S.G., Sayger, T.V., Finding meaning in loss: The mediating role of social support between personality and two construals of meaning (2012) Death Studies, 36, pp. 519-540; Braithwaite, D.O., Bach, B.W., Baxter, L.A., Constructing family: A typology of voluntary kin (2010) Journal of Social and Personal Relationships, 27, pp. 388-407; Bruhn, M., Business gifts: A form of non-verbal and symbolic communication (1996) European Management Journal, 14, pp. 61-68; Bugental, D.B., Shennum, W., Frank, M., Ekman, P., True Lies”: Children’s abuse history and power attributions as influences on deception detection (2001) Attribution, communication behavior, and close relationships, pp. 248-265. , Manusov V., Harvey J.H., (eds), New York, NY: Cambridge University Press; Burgoon, J.K., Guerrero, L.K., Floyd, K., (2010) Nonverbal communication, , Boston, MA: Allyn & Bacon; Burgoon, J.K., Guerrero, L.K., Manusov, V., Nonverbal signals (2011) Handbook of interpersonal communication, pp. 239-282. , Knapp M.L., Daly J.A., (eds), 4th ed., Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage; Burgoon, J.K., Hale, J.L., The fundamental topoi of relational communication (1984) Communication Monographs, 51, pp. 193-214; Burleson, B.R., Goldsmith, D.J., How the comforting process works: Alleviating emotional distress through conversationally induced reappraisals (1998) Handbook of communication and emotion: Research, theory, applications, and contexts, pp. 245-280. , Andersen P.A., Guerrero L.K., (eds), San Diego, CA: Academic Press; Callanan, M., Kelley, P., (1992) Final gifts: Understanding the special awareness, needs, and communications of the dying, , New York, NY: Bantam Books; Csikszentmihalyi, M., Rochberg-Halton, E., The meaning of things: Domestic symbols and the self (2009) American Anthropologist, 85, pp. 689-690; Davis, C.G., Nolen-Hoeksema, S., Loss and meaning: How do people make sense of loss?

This study examines the strategies individuals use to reduce personal or increase partner domestic labor performance. Married individuals (N = 228) responded to a questionnaire assessing perception of hours spent on household tasks, global equity, relationship length, and equity-restoring and equity-resistance strategies specific to domestic labor. Data indicate that perception of time spent on household tasks is related to equity-restoring and equity-resistance strategies. Global assessment of relational underbenefitedness or overbenefitedness was not associated with equity-restoring and equity-resisting strategies when characterized as a continuous variable; however, significant results occurred when equity was characterized categorically, highlighting the importance of methodological choices in equity research. Marriage length was negatively associated in a curvilinear function with the use of equity-restoring and equity-resistance strategies. © 2015, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Alberts, J.K., Tracy, S., Trethewey, A., An integrative theory of the division of domestic labor: Threshold level, social organizing, and sensemaking (2011) Journal of Family Communication, 11, pp. 21-38; Bartley, S.J., Blanton, P.W., Gilliard, J.L., Husbands and wives in dual earner marriages: Decision making, gender role attitudes, division of household labor and equity (2005) Marriage & Family Review, 37, pp. 69-94; Baxter, J., To marry or not to marry: Marital status and the household division of labor (2005) Journal of Family Issues, 26, pp. 300-321; Baxter, J., Hewitt, B., Western, M., Post-familial families and the domestic division of labor (2005) Journal of Comparative Family Studies, 36, pp. 583-600; Beaujot, R., Andersen, R., Time-crunch: Impact of time spent in paid and unpaid work, and its division in families (2007) The Canadian Journal of Sociology, 32, pp. 295-315; Bippus, A.M., Boren, J.P., Worsham, S., Social exchange orientation and conflict communication in romantic relationships (2008) Communication Research Reports, 25, pp. 227-234; Bird, C.E., Gender, household labor and psychological distress: The impact of the amount and division of housework (1999) Journal of Health and Social Behavior, 40, pp. 32-45; Blair, S.L., Lichter, D.T., Measuring the division of household labor: Gender segregation of housework among American couples (1991) Journal of Family Issues, 12, pp. 91-113; Brines, J., The exchange value of housework (1993) Rationality and Society, 5, pp. 302-340; Canary, D.J., Emmers-Sommer, T.M., (1997) Sex and gender differences in personal relationships, , New York, NY: Guilford Press; Canary, D.J., Lakey, S., (2013) Strategic conflict, , New York, NY: Routledge; Canary, D.J., Stafford, L., Relational maintenance strategies and equity in marriage (1992) Communication Monographs, 59, pp. 243-267; Canary, D.J., Stafford, L., People want—and maintain—fair marriages: Reply to Ragsdale and Brandau-Brown (2007) Journal of Family Communication, 7, pp. 61-68; Chethik, N., (2006) VoiceMale: What husbands really think about their marriages, their wives, sex, housework and commitment, , New York, NY: Simon & Schuster; Claffey, S.T., Mickelson, K.D., Division of household labor and distress: The role of perceived fairness for employed mothers (2009) Sex Roles, 60, pp. 819-831; Coltrane, S., Research on household labor: Modeling and measuring the social embeddedness of routine family work (2000) Journal of Marriage and Family, 62, pp. 1208-1233; Coltrane, S., Elite careers and family commitment: It’s (still) about gender (2004) The Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science, 596, pp. 214-220; Dainton, M., Equity and uncertainty in relational maintenance (2003) Western Journal of Communication, 67, pp. 164-186; Dainton, M., Gross, J., The use of negative behaviors to maintain relationships (2008) Communication Research Reports, 25, pp. 179-191; Davis, S.N., Greenstein, T.N., Gerteisen, J.P., Effects of union type on division of household labor: Do cohabiting men really perform more housework?

To address this gap, we examine the association between parental communication and young adult females’ body dissatisfaction as mediated by social competence. Female college students (N = 375; M age = 20.19) participated in an online survey which asked them to assess their perception of their mothers’ and fathers’ family communication patterns (FCPs). The hypothesized model was partially supported. Mothers’ conversation orientation was positively associated with females’ social competence, which, in turn, was negatively related to their body dissatisfaction. Results also revealed an interaction effect between mothers’ conversation and conformity orientations. Fathers’ conversation orientation was negatively and directly related to females’ body dissatisfaction. Implications of the findings are discussed. © 2015, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Al Sabbah, H., Vereecken, C.A., Elgar, F.J., Nansel, T., Aasvee, K., Abdeen, Z., Maes, L., Body weight dissatisfaction and communication with parents among adolescents in 24 countries: International cross-sectional survey (2009) BMC Public Health, 9, p. 52; Arnett, J.J., (2004) Adolescence and emerging adulthood: A cultural approach, 2nd ed.. , Upper Saddle River, NJ: Prentice Hall; Arroyo, A., Segrin, C., Family interactions and disordered eating attitudes: The mediating roles of social competence and psychological distress (2013) Communication Monographs, 80, pp. 399-424; Botta, R.A., Dumlao, R., How do conflict and communication patterns between fathers and daughters contribute to or offset eating disorders?

Thus, in the present study we focus on the backstories of 52 adult children in the United States who engaged in communicative practices to distance themselves from their parent(s). Six themes coalesced into two backstory types: (1) continuous estrangement and (2) chaotic (dis)association. Regardless of backstory type, narrative beginnings consisted of accounts detailing parental maltreatment, abuse, and indifference. Continuous estrangement occurred when adult children were able to communicatively accomplish and maintain distance with their parent(s) in spite of the network/cultural pressures to reconcile. In other instances, adult children succumbed to pressures to reconcile and engaged in communicative behaviors to decrease the distance with their parents. These participants then entered into an on-again/off-again relationship, which ultimately ended with them attempting to create distance with their parent(s) over and over until they finally were able to maintain it (i.e., chaotic [dis]association). © 2015, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Afifi, T.D., Olson, L.N., Armstrong, C., The chilling effect and family secrets: Examining the role of self-protection, other protection, and communication efficacy (2005) Human Communication Research, 31, pp. 564-598; Agllias, K., No longer on speaking terms: The losses associated with family estrangement at the end of life (2011) Families in Society: The Journal of Contemporary Social Services, 92, pp. 107-113; Agllias, K., Utilizing participants’ strengths to reduce risk of harm in a study of family estrangement (2011) Qualitative Health Research, 21, pp. 1136-1146; Agllias, K., (2013) Family estrangement.

Framed in relational dialectics theory, two discourses were identified: (1) the Discourse of Utilitarian Acquisition, in which adoption was constructed as a second-best pathway to parenting, after biological reproduction had failed, and (2) the Discourse of Redemptive Care, in which adoption was constructed as a way to provide care for children in need so that they could overcome early-life adversity. These two discourses interpenetrated largely through the discursive practice of negating, functioning to refute one another’s legitimacy. A subset of the narratives moved beyond polemic struggle to construct a hybrid meaning of adoption.

As such, couples are at a greater risk of experiencing identity gaps and their adverse effects. In this study, 153 married couples completed measures about their attachment, personal-enacted and couple-enacted identity gaps, their degrees of communication satisfaction, feelings of being understood, relational satisfaction, and commitment. Results revealed several actor and partner effects for husbands and wives’ attachment with identity gap experiences. Partner effects were also found for identity gaps with communication satisfaction, relationship satisfaction, and commitment supporting the communicative nature of identity gaps.

Participants included younger and older adults reporting on communication in their family of origin, political beliefs, and evaluations of both candidates. Results supported the expectation, guided by the moral foundations hypothesis, that family-of-origin communication patterns predict political philosophy in adulthood, with both conversation and conformity orientations predicting conservative beliefs. As predicted, political philosophy mediated the association between family communication patterns and candidate credibility. Results clarify the family’s mechanism of political socialization, indicate both direct and indirect effects of family communication patterns on candidate evaluation, and suggest pluralistic and consensual families may be particularly effective at transmitting political beliefs between parents and their children.

First, I review three fundamental concepts inherent to dyadic data analysis. I then discuss three dyadic data designs that are commonly employed within family and interpersonal communication. After highlighting the two most common statistical techniques that researchers use to analyze dyadic data (i.e., multilevel and structural equation modeling), I address some of the theoretical opportunities that exist when family communication scholars shift their thinking away from the individual to the dyad. I conclude with an exhortation to use dyadic data to help advance our theoretical understandings of both the relational and systemic dynamics that animate family interaction.

When considering how parent-child relationships are negotiated through daily interactions within perceived parameters of cultural norms and expectations, it becomes important to better understand which cultural norms and expectations are taken up by different family members who have access to different sets of cultural norms. Through the lens of positioning theory, this study analyzed home interactions of three KA families with children (ages 6–12) to investigate the relationship between bilingual use and parent-child roles. Parent-child interactions demonstrated complex negotiations around boundaries of parents’ authority through language shifts between Korean and English and speech-level shifts between formal and informal language in Korean. Family members displayed linguistic strategies that either broke away from traditionally hierarchical parent-child relationships by moving toward more friend-like horizontal relationships or reinforced expectations and norms associated with roles in the family. Findings illuminate changing patterns in norms and expectations of modern KA family relations.

This study examines how military spouses/partners cope, individually and within their families, during spousal deployment. In-depth interviews were conducted with 26 female spouses/partners with male partners currently deployed. The results indicate that military partners enact various individual (e.g., distraction/escape, emotion coaching), social (e.g., support seeking, protective buffering), and communal (e.g., adjusting responsibilities, distracting/engaging children, enabling father-child involvement, privacy management) coping strategies. The study attempts to extend Afifi et al.’s theoretical model of coping through further developing conceptualizations of coping forms and functions.

Thirty-eight adolescents were interviewed about how they and their families managed private information across the deployment cycle. Our interviewees suggested that when a deployment occurs: (a) family members should limit the information that they share with the deployed parent about events at home, (b) children should be cautious when talking to the at-home parent about the deployment situation, and (c) parents should filter some deployment-related information from their children. We explore concrete ways these rules are enacted as well as factors (e.g., dialectical tensions, motivations, salient emotions, and rule acquisition) that can shape how these rules are applied. Our analyses also illuminate how boundary turbulence can influence how youth make decisions about sharing private information. Future research should continue to explore deployment with specific attention to how privacy rules change during reintegration. © , Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,Purdue University,The authors would like to thank the Military Family Research Institute at Purdue University for their support for this project.,,"Chandra, A., Lara-Cinisomo, S., Jaycox, L.H., Tanielian, T., Burns, R.M., Ruder, T., Han, B., Children on the homefront: The experience of children from military families (2010) Pediatrics, 125, pp. 16-25; Drummet, A.R., Coleman, M., Cable, S., Military families under stress: Implications for family life education (2003) Family Relations, 52, pp. 279-287; Duck, S., (1994) Meaningful relationships: Talking, sense, and relating, , Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage; Flake, E.M., Davis, B.E., Johnson, P.L., Middleton, L.S., The psychosocial effects of deployment on military children (2009) Journal of Developmental and Behavioral Pediatrics, 30, pp. 271-278; Glaser, B., Strauss, A., (1967) The discovery of grounded theory, , Chicago, IL: Aldine; Goetz, J.P., LeCompte, M.D., (1984) Ethnography and qualitative design in educational research, , San Diego, CA: Academic Press; Greene, T., Buckman, J., Dandeker, C., Greenberg, N., How communication with families can both help and hinder service members’ mental health and occupational effectiveness on deployment (2010) Military Medicine, 175, pp. 745-749; Harwood, J., McKee, J., Lin, M.C., Younger and older adults’ schematic representations of intergenerational communication (2000) Communication Monographs, 67, pp. 20-41; Houston, J.B., Pfefferbaum, B., Sherman, M.D., Melson, A.G., Brand, M.W., Family communication across the military deployment cycle: Child and spouse report of communication frequency and quality and associated emotions, behaviors, and reactions (2013) Journal of Loss and Trauma: International Perspectives on Stress and Coping, 18, pp. 103-119; Houston, J.B., Pfefferbaum, B., Sherman, M.D., Melson, A.G., Jeon-Slaughter, H., Brand, M.W., Jarman, Y., Children of deployed National Guard troops: Perceptions of parental deployment to operation Iraqi freedom (2009) Psychiatric Annals, 39, pp. 80-811; Huebner, A.J., Mancini, J.A., (2005) Adjustment among adolescents in military families when a parent is deployed: A final report submitted to the Military Family Research Institute and the Department of Defense Quality of Life Office, , Falls Church, VA: Virginia Tech, Department of Human Development; Huebner, A.J., Mancini, J.A., Wilcox, R.M., Grass, S.R., Grass, G.A., Parental deployment and youth in military families: Exploring uncertainty and ambiguous loss (2007) Family Relations, 56, pp. 112-122; Joseph, A.L., Afifi, T.D., Military wives’ stressful disclosures to their deployed husbands: The role of protective buffering (2010) Journal of Applied Communication Research, 38, pp. 412-434; Koerner, A.F., Fitzpatrick, M.A., Communication in intact families (2004) Handbook of family communication, pp. 177-214. , Vangelisti A., (ed), Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum; Lincoln, Y.S., Guba, E., (1985) Naturalistic inquiry, , New York, NY: Sage; MacDermid-Wadsworth, S.M., Family risk and resilience in the context of war and terrorism (2010) Journal of Marriage and Family, 72, pp. 537-556; Maguire, K.C., Wilson, S.R., Introduction to the special section on communication and wartime deployment (2013) Health Communication, 28, pp. 749-753; Maholmes, V., Adjustment of children and youth in military families: Toward developmental understandings (2012) Child Development Perspectives, 6, pp. 430-435; Merolla, A.J., Relational maintenance during military deployment: Perspectives of wives of deployed U.S. soldiers (2010) Journal of Applied Communication Research, 38, pp. 4-26; (2013), http://www.militaryfamily.org/get-info/deployment/preparing-and-managing/talking-to-kids.html, Talking to kids.

To make sense of long-term anger in my family and family stories which conflict, I use narrative theory and relational dialectics theory to reframe my identity. Moving back and forth through time using a “layered account,” I compare family stories with my memories and contrast my childhood perspective with my adult perspective. Using this method enables me to analyze interpersonal tensions and sociological issues as I explore the complexity of “truth” in family stories, provide insight into the dynamics of the forgiveness processes in family relationships, and problematize the cultural ideology of the “good” mother, particularly for mothers and children who live in poverty. © , Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Adams, T.E., Seeking father: Relationally reframing a troubled love story (2006) Qualitative Inquiry, 12, pp. 704-723;

The American Academy of Pediatrics has recommended that parents limit screen time, given the risks associated with children’s heavy television viewing. Researchers have highlighted family television practices that may be effective for reducing children’s viewing, but more work is needed to identify which are most appropriate to communicate to families. Using cross-sectional data from parents of children aged 3–12 (n = 360), we confirmed a positive association between four television practices (background television, television during meals, bedroom television access, nighttime television viewing) and children’s time spent viewing. Findings for the moderating roles of race, parent education, and income provide valuable information for the design of television-reduction interventions. Most notably, results indicate that encouraging families to reduce their children’s nighttime television viewing is a promising direction for achieving healthier viewing amounts for children across developmental ages and demographic contexts. © , Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,"U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, HHS: 1020516

Three primary categories emerged: estrangement resulted from intrafamily, interfamily, or intrapersonal issues. Within each category, the frequency of parents’ and children’s reasons for estrangement differed significantly from each other. Parents reported that their primary reason for becoming estranged stemmed from their children’s objectionable relationships or sense of entitlement, whereas adult children most frequently attributed their estrangement to their parents’ toxic behavior or feeling unsupported and unaccepted. Parents also reported that they were unsure of the reason for their estrangement significantly more often than did children. Examining estrangement from the perspective of both parents and adult children offers potential avenues for family reconciliation and future communication research. © , Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Baker, A.J., The long-term effects of parental alienation on adult children: A qualitative research study (2005) American Journal of Family Therapy, 33, pp. 289-302; Bulmer, M., Concepts in the analysis of qualitative data (1979) Sociological Review, 27, pp. 651-677; Campbell, T.W., Why doesn’t parental alienation occur more frequently?

Because understandings of tradition and nontradition are constituted in discourse, we employed relational dialectics theory to examine the interplay of competing discourses in the talk of married participants who cohabited before engagement. Through retrospective interviews, we investigated the discursive struggles in participants’ talk across three contexts: pre-engagement cohabitation, the marriage proposal ritual, and the (re)telling of the proposal story to friends and family. Analysis of participant interviews illustrated three discursive struggles: (a) pragmatism and risk in cohabitation, (b) romance and partnership in the proposal ritual, and (c) privacy and revealment in the proposal ritual and (re)telling. We discuss how tradition and nontradition interplayed to redefine the engagement tradition, create new discursive meaning, and constitute couples’ shared identities. © , Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Baxter, L.A., Relationships as dialogues (2004) Personal Relationships, 11, pp. 1-22; Baxter, L.A., (2011) Voicing relationships: A dialogic perspective, , Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage; Baxter, L.A., Babbie, E., (2004) The basics of communication research, , Belmont, CA: Wadsworth; Baxter, L.A., Braithwaite, D.O., Performing marriage: The marriage renewal ritual a cultural performance (2002) Southern Communication Journal, 67, pp. 94-109; Baxter, L.A., Braithwaite, D.O., Relational dialectics theory (2008) Engaging theories in interpersonal communication: Multiple perspectives, pp. 349-361. , Baxter L.

Interactions within family are especially critical to wellness across time. Family communication is a central means of adaptation to stress, coping, and successful aging. Still, no theoretical argument in the discipline exists that prioritizes kin communication in health. Theoretical advances can enhance interventions and policies that improve family life. This article explores socioemotional selectivity theory (SST), which highlights communication in our survival. Communication partner choice is based on one’s time perspective, which affects our prioritization of goals to survive—goals sought socially. This is a first test of SST in a family communication study on women’s health and aging. More than 300 women of varying ages and health status participated. Two time factors, later adulthood and late-stage breast cancer, lead women to prioritize family communication. Findings provide a theoretical basis for prioritizing family communication issues in health reform. © , Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,"National Institute on Aging, NIA: 32 AG00048","This research was supported in part by several funding awards received by the first author: a National Institute on Aging (NIA) training grant, Interdisciplinary Training in Gerontology, #T32 AG00048; a predoctoral grant from the Joseph M.

This study analyzes survey responses provided by 195 young adults regarding the kinds of positive and negative social behaviors they experience during interactions with target grandparents. Results suggest that the nature of grandchildren’s evaluations of grandparent behavior and the impact of grandparent behavior on grandchildren’s feelings of relational satisfaction are contingent on feelings of shared familial identification, although a question remains as to whether shared family identification functions as a moderator or a mediator. Results also suggested that shared family identity interacted with perceptions of grandparents’ futures as being restricted versus expansive to shape the impact of frequent positive grandparent behaviors. © , Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Arnett, J.J., Suffering, selfish, slackers?

Guided by the theory of symbolic interactionism and a constitutive view of communication, the present study sought to understand the ways in which anonymous sperm donor-conceived offspring (DCO) make sense of their experiences and communicatively construct their identities. In-depth interviews with 14 adult DCO and 24 online postings by DCO about their experiences being donor-conceived were inductively analyzed using Interpretive Phenomenological Analysis (Smith, 2011). The following five identity constructions were identified: (a) victims, (b) wanted children, (c) enigmatic, (d) storytellers, and (e) processes. The findings capture the multiplicity and complexity of DCO’s communication and identity processes. © , Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"(2010), http://www.americanpregnancy.org/infertility/donorinsemination.html, American Pregnancy Association, Donor insemination.

Participants included 329 young adults who completed online questionnaires concerning their parents’ treatment of them and their siblings, sibling confirmation, and closeness and satisfaction with the sibling relationship. Although parents’ differential treatment (i.e., an indicator of rivalry) was inversely associated with relational closeness and satisfaction in the sibling relationship, sibling confirmation was positively associated with both outcomes. Multivariate tests provided partial support for the hypothesis that sibling confirmation would mitigate the negative effects of parents’ differential treatment on sibling closeness and satisfaction. Notably, confirmation moderated the negative effect of differential treatment on the sibling relationship, but only when young adults reported that their sibling perceives that they are the recipient of their parents’ differential treatment. © , Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Aiken, L.S., West, S.G., (1991) Multiple regression: Testing and interpreting interactions, , &, Newbury Park, CA: Sage; Boll, T., Ferring, D., Filipp, S.H., Perceived parental differential treatment in middle adulthood: Curvilinear relations with individuals’ experienced relationship quality to sibling and parents (2003) Journal of Family Psychology, 17, pp. 472-487. , &, –; Buber, M., Distance and relation (1957) Psychiatry, 20, pp. 97-104. , –; Buchanan, C.M., Maccoby, E.E., Dornbusch, S.M., Caught between parents: Adolescents’ experience in divorced homes (1991) Child Development, 62, pp. 1008-1029. , &, –; Cicirelli, V.G., Sibling relationships throughout the life cycle (1985) The handbook of family psychology and therapy, pp. 177-214. , L’Abate L., (ed), In, Ed., pp., –, Homewood, IL: Dorsey Press; Cicirelli, V.G., (1995) Sibling relationships across the lifespan, , New York, NY: Plenum Press; Dailey, R.M., Confirmation in parent-adolescent relationships and adolescent openness: Toward extending confirmation theory (2006) Communication Monographs, 73, pp. 434-458. , –; Dailey, R.M., Parental challenge: Developing and validating a measure of how parents challenge their adolescents (2008) Journal of Social and Personal Relationships, 25, pp. 643-669; Dailey, R.M., Confirmation from family members: Parent and sibling contributions to adolescent psychosocial adjustment (2009) Western Journal of Communication, 73, pp. 273-299. , –; Dailey, R.M., Testing components of confirmation: How acceptance and challenge from mothers, fathers, and siblings are related to adolescent self-concept (2010) Communication Monographs, 77, pp. 592-617. , –; Daly, M., Wilson, M., Discriminative parental solicitude: A biological perspective (1980) Journal of Marriage and Family, 42, pp. 277-288. , &, –; Daly, M., Wilson, M., The Darwinian psychology of discriminative parental solicitude (1987) Nebraska Symposium on Motivation, 35, pp. 91-144. , &, –; Daniels, D., Plomin, R., Differential experience of siblings in the same family (1985) Developmental Psychology, 5, pp. 747-760. , &, –; Darwin, C., (1859) On the origin of species, , London, UK: Murray; Dunn, J., Sibling relationships (2002) Blackwell handbook of childhood social development, pp. 223-237. , Smith P.

Using survey data from emerging adults (N = 409), we found that religious difference is associated with decreases in relational satisfaction and shared family identity. Further, parents’ religious communication has the potential to promote relational well-being. Accommodative communication (religious-specific supportive communication and respecting divergent values) was associated with increases in relational satisfaction and shared family identity. Two forms of nonaccommodative communication (inappropriate self-disclosure and emphasizing divergent values) were associated with decreases with relational satisfaction and shared family identity; giving unwanted advice was associated with decreases in relational satisfaction but not shared family identity. Giving unwanted advice moderated the relationship between religious difference and relational satisfaction. Differences were also discovered between families with inter- and intrafaith parental dyads. Findings suggest theoretical and methodological contributions to family communication, religious, and intergroup research. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Arnett, J.J., (2004) Emerging adulthood: The winding road from the late teens through the twenties, , New York, NY: Oxford University Press; Arnett, J.J., Jensen, L.A., A congregation of one: Individualized religious beliefs among emerging adults (2002) Journal of Adolescent Research, 17, pp. 451-467; Banerjee, N., (2008), http://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/25/us/25cnd-religion.html; Barry, C.M.N., Nelson, L.J., The role of religion in the transition to adulthood for young emerging adults (2005) Journal of Youth and Adolescence, 34, pp. 245-255; Braithwaite, D.O., Breshears, D., Stafford, L., Davis, K.L., Mongeau, P.A., Keeley, M., Colaner, C.W., (2012) Religion, spirituality, and interpersonal communication, , Paper presented at the National Communication Association, Orlando, FL:; Burleson, B.R., MacGeorge, E.L., Supportive communication (2002) Handbook of interpersonal communication, pp. 374-424. , Knapp M.

Open parent-adolescent communication about substances is associated with less substance use by adolescents; however, it is unclear how youth interpret antidrug use messages from their parents, especially if the parents engage in legal and/or illicit substance use themselves. Framed by social learning theory and social constructionism, this study analyzed in-depth interviews with 108 adolescents about personal experiences with substance use, family communication about substance use, and adolescent interpretations of parental use. Emergent themes in the data include: positive parental influence, parental contradictions, and negative outcomes of use. Prevalence of parental use—regardless of legality, rarity of explicit communication about parental use, and various interpretations of parental use are discussed. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,"National Institute on Drug Abuse, NIDA

Analyses were performed on the context, content, and type of 470 memorable messages reported by 303 emerging adults. Results indicated that messages were spontaneously delivered rather than planned, communicated at home, and received at around 16 years of age. Messages most often concerned relational ethics, self-honoring, honesty/fraudulence, careless/harmful acts, and personal qualities. Eleven distinct forms of communication were used by parents, including forecasting the future, empathy-enhancing, virtue-prioritizing, commanding, and identity-making. As expected, the nature of the messages varied by the gender of the parent and the age of the child at the time of the message. Parental messages appear to be influential as young adults negotiate cultural, religious, and peer sources of morality. Implications for parents and moral educators are explored. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Arnett, J.J., (2004) Emerging adulthood: The winding road from the late teens through the twenties, , New York, NY: Oxford University Press; Arnett, J.J., (2007) Socialization in emerging adulthood: From the family to the wider world, From socialization to self-socialization, , New York, NY: Guilford Press; Arnett, J.J., Ramos, K.D., Jensen, L.A., Ideological views in emerging adulthood: Balancing autonomy and community (2001) Journal of Adult Development, 8 (2), pp. 69-79; Arnett, R.C., Fritz, J.M., Bell, L.M., (2009) Communication ethics literacy: Dialogue and difference, , Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage; Bahktin, M.M., (1986) Speech genres and other late essays, , Emerson C., Holquist M., (eds), Eds., Austin, TX: University of Texas Press; Berkowitz, M.W., Grych, J.H., Early character development and education (2000) Early Education and Development, 11 (1), pp. 55-72; Borba, M., (2001) Building moral intelligence: The seven essential virtues that teach kids to do the right thing, , San Francisco, CA: Jossey-Bass; Braithwaite, D.O., Baxter, L.A., (2006) Engaging theories in family communication: Multiple perspectives, , Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage; Buber, M., (1958) I and thou, , New York, NY: Scribner; Butler Ellis, J.B., Smith, S.W., Memorable messages as guides to self-assessment of behavior: A replication and extension diary study (2004) Communication Monographs, 71 (1), pp. 97-119; Christians, C.G., Merrill, J.C., (2009) Ethical communication: Moral stances in human dialogue, , Columbia, MO: University of Missouri Press; Coles, R., Our moral lives (1986) Society, 23 (4), pp. 38-41; Côté, J., Bynner, J.M., Changes in the transition to adulthood in the UK and Canada: The role of structure and agency in emerging adulthood (2008) Journal of Youth Studies, 11 (3), pp. 251-268; Enright, R.D., Gassin, E.A., Wu, C., Forgiveness: A developmental view (1992) Journal of Moral Education, 21 (2), pp. 99-114; Fung, H., Chen, E.C.H., Across time and beyond skin: Self and transgression in the everyday socialization of shame among Taiwanese preschool children (2001) Social Development, 10, pp. 419-437; Galloway, M., Cheating in advantaged high schools: Prevalence, justifications, and possibilities for change (2012) Ethics & Behavior, 22, pp. 378-399; Gilligan, C., (1982) In a different voice, , Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press; Grusec, J.E., Davidov, M., Socialization in the family: The roles of parents (2008) Handbook of socialization: Theory and research, pp. 284-308. , Grusec J., Hastings P.

Using Galvin’s (2006) framework of boundary management, this project examined the discussions, narratives, and rituals that took place during these reunions. In-depth interviews revealed that participants wanted to absolve their birth families of guilt for placing them up for adoption and to know whether they bore any similarities to their birth families. Birth families were reported to apologize, express love for participants, convey gratitude toward adoptive families, and offer advice. Knowing their story of birth and relinquishment was important to most participants, and although birth families were reported to share this information, the narratives were sometimes perceived as incoherent. Participants also reported experiencing rituals, which included extended touch, exchanging gifts, going on outings, learning culture, and performing symbolic family acts. Results from the study suggest that engaging in these internal boundary management strategies contributed to a sense of personal identity—not just family identity—and that the birth family reunion may be a culturally recognized family ritual in South Korea. Scholarly and practical implications are discussed. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,The University of Wisconsin’s Institute on Race and Ethnicity supported this project through a Faculty Diversity Research Award.,,"Affleck, M.K., Steed, L.G., Expectations and experiences of participants in ongoing reunion relationships: A qualitative study (2001) American Journal of Orthopsychiatry, 71 (1), pp. 38-48; Baeger, D.R., McAdams, D.P., Life story coherence and its relation to psychological well-being (1999) Narrative Inquiry, 9 (1), pp. 69-96; Baxter, L.A., Babbie, E., (2004) The basics of communication research, , Belmont, CA: Wadsworth; Baxter, L.A., Braithwaite, D.O., Family rituals (2006) The family communication sourcebook, pp. 259-280. , Turner L.

This study draws on the emotional cycle of deployment model (Pincus, House, Christenson, & Adler, 2001) to examine the reunion period in military youth’s own words. Individual interviews were conducted with 31 military youth (age range = 10 to 13 years old). Participants identified four changes to family life (RQ1), including spending time together, experiencing emotional tranquility, returning to patterns in place before deployment, and having difficulty reintegrating the service member into everyday routines. Some military youth reported that the reunion matched their expectations (RQ2), but others noted that the reunion fell short of their expectations or that they did not expect the returning service member to be so tired or so irritable. Participants also described four issues of uncertainty (RQ3), including questions about the service member’s activities during deployment, reasons for joining and deploying, family life, and the possibility of future deployments. The article concludes by examining the theoretical and pragmatic implications of the findings. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Afifi, W.A., Metts, S., Characteristics and consequences of expectation violations in close relationships (1998) Journal of Social and Personal Relationships, 15, pp. 365-393; Afifi, W.A., Morse, C.R., Expanding the role of emotion in the theory of motivated information management (2009) Uncertainty, information management, and disclosure decisions: Theories and applications, pp. 87-105. , Afifi T.

The sample included 756 problem-solving sessions, nested within 189 individuals, within 63 families. Basic tenets of family therapy were used to examine the effect of the occasions of measurement, revealing that communication was less negative when the adolescent selected the problem. The individual level analysis was guided by a conflict structure perspective that found adolescents (in general) showed more negative communication behaviors than parents. At the family level, scores on the Family Adaptability and Cohesion Evaluation Scale (FACES III) were significantly related to changes in negative communication behaviors. A significant interaction between FACES III scores and negative communication behaviors showed negativity increased across sessions in families that scored lower on the FACES III, but decreased in families that scored higher. © 2014 Copyright Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Amato, P.R., Rivera, F., Personal involvement and children's behavior (1999) Journal of Marriage and the Family, 61, pp. 375-384; Barber, B.K., Buehler, C., Family cohesion and enmeshment: Different constructs, different effects (1996) Journal of Marriage and the Family, 58, pp. 433-441; Baxter, L.A., Bylund, C.L., Imes, R.S., Scheive, D.M., Family communication environments and rule-based social control of adolescents' healthy lifestyle choices (2005) Journal of Family Communication, 5, pp. 209-227; Baxter, L.A., Montgomery, B.M., (1996) Relating: Dialogues and dialectics, , New York, NY, New York, NY,: Guilford Press; Beavers, W., Voeller, M., Family models: Comparing and contrasting the Olson's circumplex model with the Beaver's system model (1983) Family Process, 21, pp. 250-260; Braithwaite, D.O., Baxter, L.A., (2006) Engaging Theories in Family Communication: Multiple Perspectives, , Thousand Oaks, CA, Thousand Oaks, CA,: Sage Publications, Inc; Braithwaite, D.O., Olson, L.N., Golish, T.D., Soukup, C., Turman, P., Becoming a family: Developmental processes represented in blended family discourse (2001) Journal of Applied Communication Research, 29, pp. 221-247; Bryk, A.S., Raudenbush, S.W., (1992) Hierarchical linear models: Applications and data analysis, , Newbury Park, CA, Newbury Park, CA,: Sage Publications; Capaldi, D.M., Forgatch, M.S., Crosby, L., Affective expression in family problem-solving discussions with adolescent boys (1994) Journal of Adolescent Research, 9, pp. 28-49; Christensen, A., Heavey, C.L., Gender and social structure in the demand/withdraw pattern of marital interaction (1990) Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 59, pp. 73-81; Cohen, J., Weighted kappa: Nominal scale agreement provision for scaled disagreement or partial credit (1968) Psychological Bulletin, 70, pp. 213-220; Cox, M.J., Paley, B., Burchinal, M., Payne, C.C., Marital perceptions and interactions across the transition to parenthood (1999) Journal of Marriage and the Family, 61, pp. 611-625; Dadds, M.R., Sanders, M.R., Morrison, M., Rebgetz, M., Childhood depression and conduct disorder: II.

Results reveal five types of stepfamily origin stories: Sudden, Dark-sided, Ambivalent, Idealized, and Incremental. Results support the hypothesis that story type would predict differences in family satisfaction; stepchildren who described their stepfamily origins as Idealized were more satisfied than those whose origins were Dark-sided or Sudden. Overall, participants framed their stepfamily identity more positively when their stepfamily beginnings were characterized by closeness, friendship, and even expected ups and downs, rather than when they were left out of the process of negotiating or forming the stepfamily and when the beginnings were tainted by issues they considered to be dark. Stepparents or practitioners may benefit from these findings by examining the means by which stepparents may involve stepchildren in the process of stepfamily courtship, facilitate closeness, and set up realistic expectations for negotiating stepfamily life. © 2014 Copyright Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Afifi, T.D., Nussbaum, J.F., Family career theories: Family stress and adaptation across the lifespan (2006) Engaging theories in family communication, pp. 276-292. , In: Braithwaite D.

Moving beyond the concept of gender as either benign or simply one of difference between men and women, a feminist perspective offers a way of conceptualizing the multiple contexts in which families are situated and where conflict and care inevitably comingle. A feminist lens has challenged family scholars to investigate and understand individuals, relationships, family structures, communities, and society in more complex and contested ways. We argue that feminist family studies offers insights for the discipline of family communication in order to contextualize the ways in which family dynamics are theorized and studied. © 2014 Copyright Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Allen, K.R., A conscious and inclusive family studies (2000) Journal of Marriage and the Family, 62, pp. 4-17; Allen, K.R., Lloyd, S.A., Few, A.L., Reclaiming feminist theory, method, and praxis for family studies (2009) Handbook of feminist family studies, pp. 3-17. , In: Lloyd S.

In line with critiques of such models within family communication, we identified the varied turning points and trajectories military spouses experience across deployment. We interviewed 50 Army and Army National Guard wives whose husbands served in missions to Iraq and Afghanistan. Participants graphed turning points and corresponding marital satisfaction levels across a recent deployment. Participants reported 519 turning points that fell into four supraordinate categories: Deployment/Military-Related Events, Life Events, Communication Events, and Other. Trajectories within each deployment phase reflected five patterns: Turbulent, Increasing, Decreasing, Stabilized, and Dipped. Most participants' trajectories reflected turbulence during the predeployment and deployment phases, and declining or dipped satisfaction during the postdeployment period. Results reflect varied experiences and provide useful information for those experiencing wartime separations or those supporting military families through deployment. © 2014 Copyright Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,This research was supported by a grant from the Center for the Study of Long Distance Relationships and JF Milne Publishing.,,"Baxter, L.A., Babbie, E., (2004) The basics of communication research, , Belmont, CA, Belmont, CA,: Wadsworth; Baxter, L.A., Braithwaite, D.O., Nicholson, J.H., Turning points in the development of blended families (1999) Journal of Social and Personal Relationships, 16, pp. 291-313; Baxter, L.A., Bullis, C., Turning points in developing romantic relationships (1986) Human Communication Research, 12, pp. 469-483; Baxter, L.A., Erbert, L.A., Perceptions of dialectical contradictions in turning points of development in heterosexual romantic relationships (1999) Journal of Social and Personal Relationships, 16, pp. 547-569; Baxter, L.A., Pittman, G., Communicatively remembering turning points of relational development in heterosexual romantic relationships (2001) Communication Reports, 14, pp. 1-17; Bolton, E.E., Litz, B.T., Glenn, D.M., Orsillo, S., Roemer, L., The impact of homecoming reception on the adaptation of peacekeepers following deployment (2003) Military Psychology, 14, pp. 241-251; Braithwaite, D.O., Olson, L.N., Golish, T.D., Soukup, C., Turman, P., ""Becoming a family"": Developmental processes represented in blended family discourse (2001) Journal of Applied Communication Research, 29, pp. 221-247; Burrell, L.M., Moving military families: The impact of relocation on family well-being, employment, and commitment to the military (2006) Military life: The psychology of serving in peace and combat (Volume 3: The military family), pp. 39-63. , In: Castro C.

We hypothesized that trait affection positively predicts both husbands and wives' enactment of relational maintenance behaviors. In addition, we hypothesized that the relative contribution of wives' trait affection to relational maintenance would be stronger than that of husbands. One hundred and forty-three married heterosexual couples completed questionnaires, and data were analyzed using the actor-partner interdependence model. Results revealed significant actor effects in 9 out of 10 cases. Results also revealed four partner effects. Husbands and wives' trait affection mutually influenced their enactment of assurances, and husbands' trait affection positively predicted wives' enactment of positivity and network sharing. Results are discussed in terms of relational maintenance research and theories of affectionate interaction. © 2014 Copyright Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Arbuckle, J.L., [Computer Program] (2009) AMOS, , Chicago, IL, Chicago, IL,: SPSS, Version 19.0; Baumeister, R.F., Leary, M.R., The need to belong: Desire for interpersonal attachments as a fundamental human motivation (1995) Psychological Bulletin, 117, pp. 497-529; Browne, M.W., Cudeck, R., Alternative ways of assessing model fit (1993) Testing structural models, pp. 136-162. , In: Bollen K.

Participants included 374 young adults recruited from two universities in different regions of the United States. Results best supported a model positioning maintenance as a mediator of the association between FCP and IOS, as compared to an alternative model with IOS as a mediator of the association between FCP and maintenance. These findings extend Koerner and Fitzpatrick's theory by highlighting communication as the means by which overarching family schemas influence relationship-specific schemas; additionally, they commend the self-expansion model as a useful theoretical approach to relational maintenance behavior in family contexts.

Data were gathered through 20 in-depth interviews with adults who remembered a parent coming out to them as lesbian or gay. One discursive struggle animated the participants' talk about their parents' coming out: the discourse of lesbian and gay identity as wrong vs. the discourse of lesbian and gay identity as acceptable. Analysis of participants' talk about their familial identities revealed a range of avenues for resisting the negative discourses regarding lesbian and gay identities. The findings highlight discursive power in participants' talk about their familial identities and how participants organize the conflicting messages they receive in their culture and in relationships regarding family identities.

Participants were 61 children/adolescents aged 5-18, who participated in semi-structured interviews regarding their FCs with a dying family member. Inductive coding analysis led the authors to discover four overarching themes of children/adolescents' FCs messages, in order of descending prominence, are: everyday communication, messages of love, messages of individual identity, and messages related to religion/spirituality. The authors applied Functional Theory to further delineate how participants used, and continue to use, the messages from each theme within their FCs. Discussion of results, including limitations and directions for further research, is outlined.

Narrative beginnings were dominated by a discourse of adoption as a valuable alternative to pregnancy. Narrative middles-and-ends featured two discourses of how the adoption process unfolds: adoption as a worthwhile struggle guided by destiny and adoption as a smooth and predictable process. Intertwined with these process-oriented constructions of adoption was a discourse of adoption as communal kinning, which emphasized a hybrid family form comprised of both biological and nonbiological ties.

Participants were National Guard families attending yellow-ribbon reintegration events. Parents completed the Revised Family Communication Patterns short-form measure as well as the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire about their oldest child. For deployed parents, conversation orientation was associated with fewer reported child behavioral problems and more prosocial child behavior during the reunion period, suggesting that conversation orientation serves as a protective factor as service members reintegrate into the family. At-home parents' reports of conversation orientation were not significantly associated with their reports of child difficulties or prosocial behavior. Future research needs to clarify how the communicative behaviors of deployed and at-home parents might function differently in promoting children's resiliency during a military parent's deployment and return. © 2014 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Afifi, T.D., McManus, T., Hutchinson, S., Baker, B., Inappropriate parental divorce disclosures, the factors that prompt them, and their impact on parents' and adolescents' well-being (2007) Communication Monographs, 74, pp. 78-102; Barnes, V.A., Davis, H., Treiber, F.A., Perceived stress, heart rate, and blood pressure among adolescents with family members deployed in Operation Iraqi Freedom (2007) Military Medicine, 172, pp. 40-43; Baxter, L.A., Clark, C.L., Perceptions of family communication patterns and the enactment of family rituals (1996) Western Journal of Communication, 60, pp. 254-268; Borden, L.M., Bosch, L., Card, N.A., Casper, D.M., Hawkins, S.A., Schlomer, G.L., Tokarski, B.T., Wiggs, C.B., (2011) The impact of deployment on children: A review of the quantitative and qualitative literature, , https://www.militaryfamilies.psu.edu/sites/default/files/reports/AZ_REACH_Impact_of_Deployment_on_Children.pdf, Tuscon, AZ: University of Arizona Center for Research and Outreach.

Data from 188 emerging adults were analyzed. Results indicated that family conversation orientation and the interaction of family conversation and conformity orientation were significantly related to emerging adults' openness about their credit card behaviors. Further, emerging adults who paid their own credit cards shared less with their parents about their credit card behaviors. Although not statistically significant, moderation analyses suggested that emerging adults who paid their own credit card bills were perhaps less influenced by FCPs regarding openness with their parent(s) about their credit card use than emerging adults whose parents paid their credit card bills. These findings add to the literature on family openness regarding credit card behaviors by examining this phenomenon through a FCP theory lens. © 2014 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Allen, M.W., Consumer finance and parent-child communication (2008) The handbook of consumer finance research, pp. 351-361. , In: Xiao J.

Fifty families (mother, father, and mid-adolescent child) discussed family changes desired by each person. In high versus low conformity families, parents (fathers especially) pressured more, were more confrontational, and were less conciliatory, whereas children were less analytic and more apt to withdraw in response to parental demand. Fathers were especially conciliatory and analytic in families that combined high conversation orientation and low conformity (i.e., the pluralistic family type). The results confirm expected associations between family communication orientations and observed conflict patterns, suggesting that basic orientations to communication affect how families adapt to the communicative challenges of adolescence. © 2014 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,"University of Montana, UM",The research was assisted by a grant from the University of Montana to Alan Sillars.,,"Aiken, L.S., West, S.G., (1991) Multiple regression: Testing and interpreting interactions, , Newbury Park, CA, Newbury Park, CA,: Sage; Algina, J., Olejnik, S., Sample size tables for correlation analysis with applications in partial correlation and multiple regression analysis (2003) Multivariate Behavioral Research, 38, pp. 309-323; Botta, R.A., Dumlao, R., How do conflict and communication patterns between fathers and daughters contribute to or offset eating disorders?

Significant correlations emerged between the conformity orientation and masculinity gender ideology and the conversation orientation and androgyny gender ideology. Additionally, results suggest men model their fathers' conformity orientations but neither model nor compensate for their fathers' conversation orientations. Findings support the links between communication patterns and gender ideologies, while demonstrating how men's identities are influenced by the ideologies they accept and transmit within the family. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Aron, A., Aron, E.N., Smollan, D., Inclusion of Other in the Self Scale and the structure of interpersonal closeness (1992) Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 63, pp. 596-612; Bandura, A., Psychotherapy as a learning process (1961) Psychological Bulletin, 58, pp. 143-159; Beaton, J.M., Doherty, W.J., Rueter, M.A., Family of origin processes and attitudes of expectant fathers (2003) Fathering: A Journal of Theory, Research, and Practice about Men as Fathers, 1, pp. 149-168; Beatty, M.J., Dobos, J.A., Adult males' perceptions of confirmation and relational partner communication apprehension: Indirect effects of fathers on sons' partners (1993) Communication Quarterly, 41, pp. 66-76; Bem, S.L., The measurement of psychological androgyny (1974) Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology, 42, pp. 155-162; Berzins, J.I., Welling, M.A., Wetter, R.E., A new measure of psychological androgyny based on the personality research form (1978) Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology, 46, pp. 126-138; Brody, L.R., Gender and emotion: Beyond stereotypes (1997) The Society for the Psychological Study of Social Issues, 53, pp. 369-393; Brody, G.H., Shaffer, D.R., Contributions of parents and peers to children's moral socialization (1982) Developmental Review, 2, pp. 31-75; Bruess, C.J.S., Pearson, J.C., Gendered patterns in family communication (1996) Gendered relationships, pp. 59-78. , In: Wood J.

We surveyed 100 individuals who were part of 50 couples who had recently entered the empty-nest phase of their relationship to identify themes of relationship change (RQ1), relational uncertainty (RQ2), and interference from partners (RQ3) during the empty-nest transition. Results revealed five themes of relationship change: (a) increased couple time, (b) reduced structure provides increased freedom, (c) increased communication, (d) increased privacy, and (e) new beginnings. Four themes of relational uncertainty were identified: (a) new roles and identities, (b) dependency anxiety, (c) love and intimacy, and (d) growing older. Four themes of partner interference were also found: (a) relationship facilitation, (b) guilt, (c) forced activity, and (d) household chores. Our findings suggest that the relational turbulence model may be a useful tool for understanding the relationship challenges faced by couples during late-life transitions. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Anderson, S.A., Russell, C.S., Schumm, W.R., Perceived marital quality and family life-cycle categories: A further analysis (1983) Journal of Marriage and the Family, 45, pp. 127-139; Berger, C.R., Bradac, J.J., (1982) Language and social knowledge: Uncertainty in interpersonal relationships, , London, London,: Edward Arnold; Berger, C.R., Calabrese, R.J., Some explorations in initial interaction and beyond: Toward a developmental theory of interpersonal communication (1975) Human Communication Research, 1, pp. 99-112; Berscheid, E., Emotion (1983) Close relationships, pp. 110-168. , In: Kelley H.

In particular, children and their nonresidential parent's family may potentially manage challenges in their communication as the child transitions into stepfamily life. Centered in the interpretive paradigm and Communication Accommodation Theory (CAT), the researcher interviewed 27 children of divorce about their transition into stepfamily life to address how, if at all, they accommodated their communication with the nonresidential parent's family as well as their perceptions of their family's accommodation. The findings highlight the complexity of managing familial roles in the face of change. Implications and directions for future research are also addressed. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Afifi, T.D., ""Feeling caught"" in stepfamilies: Managing boundary turbulence through appropriate privacy coordination rules (2003) Journal of Social and Personal Relationships, 20, pp. 729-756; Afifi, T.D., Keith, S., A risk and resiliency model of ambiguous loss in postdivorce stepfamilies (2004) Journal of Family Communication, 4 (2), pp. 65-98; Afifi, W., Matsunaga, M., Uncertainty management theories (2007) Engaging theories in interpersonal communication: Multiple perspectives, pp. 117-132. , In: Braithwaite D.

Specifically, building from Koerner and Fitzpatrick's theory of family communication schemas, we predicted that family communication patterns (i.e., conversation and conformity orientations) would serve as an individual factor that meaningfully predicts employee dissent. Significant findings emerged for upward dissent but not lateral dissent, with both a main effect for conformity orientation and interaction between conversation and conformity orientations. Decomposition of the interaction effect indicated that, as hypothesized, employees from pluralistic (high conversation, low conformity) families were more likely to express upward dissent than employees from consensual (high conversation, high conformity) families. This pattern of results informs both organizational practice and the theoretical intersection between family and organizational communication. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Avtgis, T.A., Thomas-Maddox, C., Taylor, E., Patterson, B.R., The influence of employee burnout syndrome on the expression of organizational dissent (2007) Communication Research Reports, 24, pp. 97-102; Baldwin, M.W., Relational schemas and the processing of social information (1992) Psychological Bulletin, 112, pp. 461-484; Barge, J.K., Schlueter, D.W., Memorable messages and newcomer socialization (2004) Western Journal of Communication, 68, pp. 233-256; Chaffee, S.H., McLeod, J.M., Atkin, D.K., Parental influences on adolescent media use (1971) American Behavioral Scientist, 14, pp. 323-340; Cohen, J., Cohen, P., West, S.G., Aiken, L.S., (2003) Applied multiple regression/correlation analysis for the behavioral sciences, , 3rd, Mahwah, NJ, Mahwah, NJ,: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates; Farrell, D., Rusbult, C.E., Exploring the exit, voice, loyalty, and neglect typology: The influence of job satisfaction, quality of alternatives, and investment size (1992) Journal of Employee Right & Responsibilities, 5, pp. 201-218; Fitzpatrick, M.A., Marshall, L.J., Leutwiler, T.J., Krcmar, M., The effects of family communication environments on children's social behavior during middle childhood (1996) Communication Research, 23, pp. 379-406; Fletcher, G.J.O., Cognition in close relationships (1993) New Zealand Journal of Psychology, 22, pp. 69-81; Garner, J.T., Wargo, M.R., Feedback from the pew: A dual-perspective exploration of organizational dissent in churches (2009) Journal of Communication and Religion, 32, pp. 375-400; Hegstrom, T.G., (1991) The accounts of organizational dissenters, , September, September, Paper presented at the University of Colorado Conference on Narrative and Organizational Studies in Communication, Keystone, CO; Hirschman, A.O., (1970) Exit, voice, and loyalty, , Cambridge, MA, Cambridge, MA,: Harvard University Press; Kassing, J.W., Articulating, antagonizing, and displacing: A model of employee dissent (1997) Communication Studies, 48, pp. 311-332; Kassing, J.W., Development and validation of the organizational dissent scale (1998) Management Communication Quarterly, 12, pp. 183-229; Kassing, J.W., Exploring the relationship between workplace freedom of speech, organizational identification, and employee dissent (2000) Communication Research Reports, 17, pp. 387-396; Kassing, J.W., Investigating the relationship between superior-subordinate relationship quality and employee dissent (2000) Communication Research Reports, 17, pp. 58-70; Kassing, J.W., Consider this: A comparison of factors contributing to employees' expressions of dissent (2008) Communication Quarterly, 56, pp. 342-355; Kassing, J.W., (2011) Dissent in organizations, , Cambridge, UK, Cambridge, UK, Polity; Kassing, J.W., Armstrong, T.A., Examining the association of job tenure, employment history, and organizational status with employee dissent (2001) Communication Research Reports, 18, pp. 264-273; Kassing, J.W., Armstrong, T.A., Someone's going to hear about this: Examining the association between dissent-triggering events and employees' dissent expression (2002) Management Communication Quarterly, 16, pp. 39-65; Kassing, J.W., Avtgis, T.A., Examining the relationship between organizational dissent and aggressive communication (1999) Management Communication Quarterly, 13, pp. 100-115; Kassing, J.W., Avtgis, T.A., Dissension in the organization as it relates to control expectancies (2001) Communication Research Reports, 18, pp. 118-127; Kassing, J.W., DiCioccio, R.L., Testing a workplace experience explanation of displaced dissent (2004) Communication Reports, 17, pp. 113-120; Kassing, J.W., McDowell, Z.J., Disagreeing about what's fair: Exploring the relationship between perceptions of justice and employee dissent (2008) Communication Research Reports, 25, pp. 34-43; Kassing, J.W., Piemonte, N.M., Goman, C.C., Mitchell, C.A., Dissent expression as an indicator of work engagement and intention to leave (2012) Journal of Business Communication, 49, pp. 237-253; Koerner, A.F., Fitzpatrick, M.A., Toward a theory of family communication (2002) Communication Theory, 12, pp. 70-91; Koerner, A.F., Fitzpatrick, M.A., Understanding family communication patterns and family functioning: The roles of conversation orientation and conformity orientation (2002) Communication Yearbook, 26, pp. 37-69; Koerner, A.F., Fitzpatrick, M.A., You never leave your family in a fight: The impact of families of origins on conflict-behavior in romantic relationships (2002) Communication Studies, 53, pp. 234-251; Koerner, A.F., Fitzpatrick, M.A., Family communication patterns theory: A social cognitive approach (2006) Engaging theories in family communication: Multiple perspectives, pp. 50-65. , In: Braithwaite D.

Controlling for potential confounds, physical discipline decreased over the course of middle childhood, whereas harsh verbal and nonharsh discipline remained stable. Increases in interparental conflict were associated with increases in physical discipline; decreases in interparental conflict were associated with decreases in physical discipline. Change in interparental conflict was unrelated to change in harsh verbal or nonharsh discipline, although more frequent interparental conflict was associated with more frequent use of all three types of discipline in 1st grade. Findings extend previous research on how two major forms of communication within families-conflict between parents and parents' attempts to influence their children through discipline-change across middle childhood. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,"Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, NICHD: DA016903

A total of 133 stepchildren completed an online survey about their perceptions of their stepparents' accommodative and nonaccommodative behaviors. A measure of accommodation, overaccommodation, and underaccommodation was created for this study and items were tested with factor analysis. Findings indicate support for CAT's predictions: perceptions of stepparent accommodation, underaccommodation and overaccommodation predict stepchildren's accommodative behavior in typical interactions, as well as their conversation satisfaction, relational closeness and perceptions of shared family identity with their stepparents. Further, stepchildren's perceptions of shared family identity with stepparents correlate positively with their reports of satisfaction with blended family life. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Afifi, T.D., Schrodt, P., ""Feeling caught"" as a mediator of adolescents' and young adults' avoidance and satisfaction with their parents in divorced and non-divorced households (2003) Communication Monographs, 70, pp. 142-173; Allport, G.W., (1954) The nature of prejudice, , Reading, MA, Reading, MA,: Addison-Wesley; Anderson, J.Z., White, G.D., An empirical investigation of interaction and relationship patterns of functional and dysfunctional nuclear families and stepfamilies (1986) Family Process, 25, pp. 407-422; Banker, B.S., Gaertner, S.L., Achieving stepfamily harmony: An intergroup relations approach (1998) Journal of Family Psychology, 12, pp. 310-325; Baxter, L.A., Braithwaite, D.O., Bryant, L., Wagner, A., Stepchildren's perceptions of the contradictions in communication with stepparents (2004) Journal of Social and Personal Relationships, 21, pp. 447-467; Baxter, L.A., Braithwaite, D.O., Nicholson, J.H., Turning points in the development of blended families (1999) Journal of Social and Personal Relationships, 16, pp. 291-313; Braithwaite, D.O., Baxter, L.A., Meta-theory and theory in interpersonal communication research (2008) Engaging theories in interpersonal communication: Multiple perspectives, pp. 1-18. , In: Baxter L.

Caregiver-child dyads (N = 50) reported on whether or not they had discussed 10 kindergarten transition topics, indicated who initiated conversations about topics which had been discussed, and read a story together. Caregivers also responded to 6 hypothetical child statements of concern about the transition to kindergarten. Segments within the storybook task and all 6 responses to hypothetical child statements of concern were coded for verbal and nonverbal confirmation as acceptance and verbal confirmation as challenge. Key significant findings include positive relationships between caregiver confirmation as verbal and nonverbal acceptance and the percentage of transition topics initiated by children. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,"This research was supported in part by the Center for Families at Purdue University.

Overall, studies have produced interesting and practical information, and the trajectories are relatively consistent across studies. After reviewing the history and substance of this research, I advocate family communication scholars continue inquire in the area. Researchers should identify varied trajectories for processes (e.g., health-related decisions) and within yet unexplored family relationships (e.g., transnational families). Future studies that shift from identifying trajectories of familial relationships to identifying discourses of family time and change would enrich this area of research, as well.

These associations, along with the indirect effects of social skills and psychosocial problems, were examined using structural equation modeling. Results indicated that fathers' social skills and loneliness are predictive of their adult children's social skills, mothers' loneliness is predictive of their adult children's loneliness; and fathers' and mothers' anxiety is predictive of their adult children's anxiety. Additionally, lower social skills were significantly associated with greater loneliness and anxiety for all family members. Finally, there was no evidence of indirect effects for parents' social skills or psychosocial problems on their adult children's social skills or psychosocial problems, through parents' psychosocial problems or adult child social skill, respectively. Implications for social skills and psychosocial problems on a family level are discussed. © 2013 Copyright Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Bandura, A., (1977) Social learning theory, , Englewood Cliffs, NJ, Englewood Cliffs, NJ,: Prentice-Hall; Bandura, A., (1986) Social foundations of thought and action: A social cognitive theory, , Englewood Cliffs, NJ, Englewood Cliffs, NJ,: Prentice Hall; Boomsma, D.I., Cacioppo, J.T., Muthén, B., Asparouhov, T., Clark, S., Longitudinal genetic analysis for loneliness in Dutch twins (2007) Twin Research and Human Genetics, 10, pp. 267-273; Boomsma, D.I., Willemsen, G., Dolan, C., Hawkley, L.C., Cacioppo, J.T., Genetic and environmental contributions to loneliness in adults (2005) Behavior Genetics, 35, pp. 745-752; Buhrmester, D., Furman, W., Wittenberg, M.T., Reis, H.T., Five domains of interpersonal competence in peer relationships (1988) Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 55, pp. 991-1008; Burleson, B.R., Delia, J.G., Applegate, J.L., The socialization of person-centered communication: Parents' contributions to their social-cognitive and communication skills (1995) Explaining Family Interactions, pp. 34-76. , In: Fitzpatrick M.

Results indicated high correlations between perceived and ideal FCP dimensions for both parents and their children. Parents reported higher scores than children did on perceived conversation orientation, ideal conversation orientation, and ideal conformity orientation. Children reported a larger gap between perceived and ideal conformity orientation, the result of a perceived excess of conformity orientation in the family. For both parents and children, unmet conversation ideals were largely the result of insufficient conversation orientation to meet desires. After controlling statistically for perceived conversation orientation, parent satisfaction was negatively predicted from the parent-child discrepancy on conversation orientation, and child satisfaction was negatively predicted from the parent-child discrepancy on conformity orientation.

A content analysis of articles reporting on youth under the age of 18 revealed the extent to which children have been represented in communication research from 1997-2010, as well as the methodologies, topical areas, and theories guiding communication research on children. Results indicate that only 3.7% of all published articles in leading communication journals focused on children, a number far less than the 10% speculated in previous research. This article uncovers a vast array of theories employed in studies of children, with social cognitive/learning theory being the most common and survey methods the most common tool for collecting information.

College students (N = 500) reported on a risky behavior they were keeping from a parent, sibling, or friend and were asked two months later whether they revealed it. They were more willing to reveal their risky behavior to their peers and siblings compared to their parents. When it came to actually revealing their risky behavior, however, the type of target alone did not seem to truly influence the disclosure of the risky behavior. What mattered was the type of message and the interaction between the type of message and the type of target. College students were more likely to reveal their risky behavior when they thought the person would be more confirming and challenging and less disconfirming. The expectation of these messages was, however, important when revealing to parents and siblings, but not peers. None of the expected responses from peers increased the likelihood that college students revealed their risky behavior to them. © 2013 Copyright Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Afifi, T.D., Joseph, A., Aldeis, D., Why can't we just talk about it?

As such, it is important to investigate how daughters engage in meaning making regarding this relationship. The researchers used relational dialectics theory (Baxter, 2011; Baxter & Montgomery, 1996) to illuminate the interplay of discourses college-aged women voice as they talk with others about their relationships with their mothers. Framed within the dialectic of closeness and distance, inductive analysis revealed a total of six discourses at play in daughters' meaning making processes. Three discourses (i.e., friendship, parenthood, and independence) were voiced when daughters discussed times they felt closest to their mothers. The other three discourses (i.e., containment, impropriety, and separation) were evident in daughters' talk about times they felt distanced from their mothers. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed. © 2013 Copyright Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Baxter, L.A., Relationships as dialogues (2004) Personal Relationships, 11, pp. 1-22; Baxter, L.A., A dialogic approach to interpersonal/family communication (2010) Distinctive qualities in communication research, pp. 13-31. , In: Carbaugh D., Buzzanell P.

Using the theory of Communication Privacy Management (CPM), this study analyzed semistructured interviews of 20 familial caregivers near a medium-sized, Midwestern city. The adult children studied perceived that their parents employed thick privacy boundaries and high privacy control goals around their financial information. The parents were also perceived to use risk-benefit and contextual criteria in creating privacy rules regulating revealing and concealing private financial information. Once financial caregiving assistance was required and disclosure was necessary, boundary linkages between parents and adult children were created, and adult children engaged in postdisclosure privacy management. Based on the study results, practical applications were offered for seniors, their families, and eldercare professionals. © 2013 Copyright Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Allen, M.W., Consumer finance and parent-child communication (2008) The handbook of consumer finance research, pp. 351-361. , In: Xiao J.

This study utilizes Communication Privacy Management theory as a framework to investigate how young adult Facebook users respond to parental Facebook friend requests. Overall, 235 individuals completed an online survey. Results confirmed that users tend to accept parental Facebook friend requests from both parents and make few restrictive privacy rule adjustments when contemplating the requests. However, request decisions for mothers varied in conjunction with family privacy orientation, parent-child relationship quality, and parent-child trust, but not for fathers. These results suggest that young adults do not experience a privacy dilemma when contemplating parental connections on Facebook. Implications of the study are explored, including how power differentials inherent in the parent-child relationship may be impacting young adults' perceived ability to decline such requests. Future research examining other familial conversations about social media practices is highlighted. © 2013 Copyright Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Caughlin, J.P., Golish, T.D., Olson, L.N., Sargent, J.E., Cook, J.S., Petronio, S., Intrafamily secrets in various family configurations: A communication boundary management perspective (2000) Communication Studies, 51, pp. 116-134. , doi:10.1080/10510970009388513; Child, J.T., Agyeman-Budu, E., Blogging privacy rule development: The impact of self-monitoring skills, concern for appropriateness, and blogging frequency (2010) Computers in Human Behavior, 26, pp. 957-963. , doi:10.1016/j.chb.2010.02.009; Child, J.T., Haridakis, P.M., Petronio, S., Blogging privacy rule orientations, privacy management, and content deletion practices: The variability of online privacy management activity at different stages of social media use (2012) Computers in Human Behavior, 28, pp. 1859-1872. , doi:10.1016/j.chb.2012.05.004; Child, J.T., Pearson, J.C., Petronio, S., Blogging, communication, and privacy management: Development of the blogging privacy management measure (2009) Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology, 60, pp. 2079-2094. , doi:10.1002/asi.21122; Child, J.T., Petronio, S., Unpacking the paradoxes of privacy in CMC relationships: The challenges of blogging and relational communication on the internet (2011) Computer-mediated communication in personal relationships, pp. 21-40. , In: Wright K.

Using Communication Privacy Management to inductively analyze interviews, we found parents were motivated to talk to their children about death because they wanted their children to be informed. This is reflected in the first primary theme, Recalibrating Family of Origin Privacy Orientation Rules: Motivations for Revealing. Two secondary themes further explained parents' motivations to reveal: death as a part of life and modeling grief. Even though parents wanted to inform their children, they also wanted to protect their children and this protection is demonstrated in the second primary theme, Protecting Children: Motivations for Balancing Revealing/Concealing as well as the secondary themes of selective honesty as a rule regulator and religion as a reference point. © 2013 Copyright Taylor &Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Afifi, T., ""Feeling caught"" in stepfamilies: Managing boundary turbulence through appropriate communication privacy rules (2003) Journal of Social and Personal Relationships, 20, pp. 729-755; Baker, J.E., Sedney, M.A., How bereaved children cope with loss: An overview (1996) Handbook of childhood death and bereavement, pp. 109-129. , In: Corr C.

The study suggests CPM is a useful way to conceptualize the communication that couples and families have about SSM. © 2013 Copyright Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Baxter, L.A., Babbie, E., (2004) The basics of communication research, , Belmont, CA, Belmont, CA,: Wadsworth; Baxter, L.A., Montgomery, B.M., (1996) Relating: Dialogues and dialectics, , New York, NY, New York, NY,: Guilford Press; Beeler, J., DiProva, V., Family adjustment following disclosure of homosexuality by a member: Themes discerned in narrative accounts (1999) Journal of Marital and Family Therapy, 25, pp. 443-459; Berg, B.L., (1995) Qualitative research methods for the social sciences, , 2nd, Boston, MA, Boston, MA,: Allyn and Bacon; Boyatzis, R.E., (1998) Transforming qualitative information: Thematic analysis and code development, , Thousand Oaks, CA, Thousand Oaks, CA,: Sage; Caughlin, J.P., Petronio, S., Privacy in families (2004) Handbook of family communication, pp. 379-412. , In: Vangelisti A.

Overall, mean ratings across all adoption triad members suggested more incoherence than coherence, but relative differences were found among triad members. Adoptive parents scored the highest on sequential organization, orientation, and causal explanation. Birth mothers scored the highest on congruence of affect with content. Narrative coherence has been systematically correlated in the literature with psychological adjustment, and the implications of the study are discussed for their insights into how well adoption triad members have adjusted to the challenges associated with adoption. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Baerger, D.R., McAdams, D.P., Life story coherence and its relation to psychological well-being (1999) Narrative Inquiry, 9, pp. 69-96; Baxter, L.A., Henauw, C., Huisman, D., Livesay, C., Norwood, K., Su, H., Wolf, B., Young, B., Lay conceptions of ""family"": A replication and extension (2009) Journal of Family Communication, 9, pp. 170-189; Becker, G., (1997) Disrupted lives: How people create meaning in a chaotic world, , Berkeley, CA: University of California Press; Benson, P.L., Sharma, A.R., Roehlkepartain, E.C., (1994) Growing up adopted: A portrait of adopted adolescents and their families, , Minneapolis, MN: Search Institute; Blanton, T., Deschner, J., Biological mothers' grief: The postadoptive experience in open versus confidential adoption (1990) Child Welfare, 69, pp. 525-535; Boss, P., (1999) Ambiguous loss, , Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press; Brodzinsky, D., Family structural openness and communication openness as predictors in the adjustment of adopted children (2006) Adoption Quarterly, 4, pp. 1-18; Clark, L.F., Stress and the cognitive-conversational benefits of social interaction (1993) Journal of Social and Clinical Psychology, 12, pp. 25-55; Cohen, J., (1969) Statistical power analysis for the behavioral sciences, , New York, NY: Academic Press; Colaner, C.W., Kranstuber, H., ""Forever kind of wondering"": Communicatively managing uncertainty in adoptive families (2010) Journal of Family Communication, 10, pp. 236-255; Deykin, E.Y., Campbell, L., Patti, P., The postadoption experience of surrendering parents (1984) American Journal of Orthopsychiatry, 54, pp. 271-280; Dunbar, N., Grotevant, H.D., Adoption narratives: The construction of adoptive identity during adolescence (2004) Family stories and the life course: Across time and generation,, pp. 135-161. , In: Pratt M.

A sample of 130 self-identified distant family caregivers completed an online survey about their communication with their care recipient. Overall topic avoidance and the self-protection and partner unresponsiveness motivations were significant, positive predictors of distant family caregivers' self-reported negative health perceptions. The remaining topic avoidance motivations were not significant predictors. This study is one of the first known to examine communication in the distant family caregiving context, and it offers possibilities for future research on communication barriers and health issues that impact this growing population. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,Chapman University,"The study was funded by a 2008–2009 Chapman University Chancellor’s Research Fund Grant awarded to the fourth author.

A theoretical model predicted that shyness would be negatively associated with social skills, and socials skills would, in turn, be positively associated with perceived family communication. Participants included 111 parent-adult child dyads. Parents and adult children completed measures of shyness, social skills, and perceived family communication in an online questionnaire. Results of structural equation modeling indicated that, as predicted, parent and adult child shyness were negatively associated with their own social skills. In addition, adult children's social skills were significantly associated with perceived family communication, but their parents' social skills were not. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Aiken, R.M., Shyness and self-presentation (1987) Self and identity: Psychosocial perspectives, pp. 187-196. , In: Krysia Y., Honess T., editors Oxford, England: John Wiley & Sons; Aron, E.N., Aron, A., Davies, K.M., Adult shyness: The interaction of temperamental sensitivity and an adverse childhood environment (2005) Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, 31, pp. 181-197; Bandura, A., (1977) Social learning theory, , New York, NY: General Learning Press; Barrett, P.M., Rapee, R.M., Dadds, M.M., Ryan, S.M., Family enhancement of cognitive style in anxious and aggressive children (1996) Journal of Abnormal Child Psychology, 24, pp. 187-204; Bohlin, G., Hagekull, B., Socio-emotional development: From infancy to young adulthood (2009) Scandinavian Journal of Psychology, 50, pp. 592-601; Borelli, J., David, D., Crowley, M., Mayes, L., Links between disorganized attachment classification and clinical symptoms in school-aged children (2010) Journal of Child and Family Studies, 19, pp. 243-256; Bowlby, J., (1969) Attachment and loss, Vol. 1: Attachment, , New York, NY: Basic Books; Breivik, K., Olweus, D., Endresen, I., Does the quality of parent-child relationships mediate the increased risk for antisocial behavior and substance use among adolescents in single-mother and single-father families?

The study examined: (a) parental treatment of their children's birth country names in the naming process and (b) parental motives for various naming forms (i.e., placement of the child's birth culture name within the full name). Focus groups were conducted with 32 U.S. White American parents with an adopted child from either China or Vietnam. Results present a catalog of four international adoptee naming forms, with parents choosing to retain, alter, create a new, or exclude the birth culture name. Parents were found to appeal to two primary motivations-identity and pragmatism-to justify and explain these differing naming forms. This study found that naming promoted three identity source domains: family identity, ethnic identity, and individual identity. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Aura, S., Hess, G.D., What's in a name?

Drawing upon interviews with 20 fathers, 16 mothers, and 23 children who dealt with financial hardship during the 1980s recession, we analyze the messages families communicated about finances when their children were young and how these messages contributed to the development of short- and long-term resiliencies. The family talk and material practices of numbers talk, tightening the belt, sidelining, and preparing, as well as general talk of resiliency, transmitted through the generations a dual-layer of resilience. The first layer involved persisting through the immediate financial crisis. The second dealt with shaping the value systems and attitudes of the younger generation in ways that taught long-term resiliencies they carried into adulthood. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,Purdue Research Foundation,"This research was funded, in part, by grants from the Purdue Research Foundation and the Grace H.

Confirmatory factor analysis identified three dimensions of parental invasion (verbal, spatial, and mediated) and five dimensions of children's defense (secrecy, mediated, avoidance, direct, and peer). Both parental invasions and children's defenses were negatively associated with family satisfaction and conversation orientation, and positively associated with family conformity orientation. High family conversation mitigated against the positive contribution of conformity to secrecy, direct, and peer defenses. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Afifi, T.D., Feeling caught' in stepfamilies: Managing boundary turbulence through appropriate communication privacy rules (2003) Journal of Social and Personal Relationships, 20, pp. 729-755; Afifi, T.D., Steuber, K., The cycle of concealment model (2010) Journal of Social and Personal Relationships, 27, pp. 1019-1034; Afifi, W.A., Caughlin, J.P., A close look at revealing secrets and some consequences that follow (2006) Communication Research, 33, pp. 467-488; Argyle, M., Henderson, M., The rules of friendship (1984) Journal of Social and Personal Relationships, 1, pp. 211-237; Altman, I., Taylor, D.A., (1973) Social penetration: The development of interpersonal relationships, , New York, NY: Holt, Rinehart, & Winston; Arnett, J.J., Are college students adults?

Sibling relationships were diverse in the extent, form, and direction of support, as reflected in seven types of sibling support relationships (separates, pals, allies, opponents, parent, protector, encourager). Availability/companionship with siblings predicted improved adjustment to divorce, whereas multiple dimensions of maternal support predicted adjustment. Qualitative analyses suggested that the company of a sibling provided reassurance and promoted resilience, even in the absence of explicit support messages or tangible assistance. Supportive siblings appeared to buffer children by providing a sense of continuity and shared experience during family reorganization. Sibling support typically served a complementary role to parental support. However, siblings sometimes provided more extensive and direct compensatory support in situations where competent parental support was unavailable. Such assistance helped children to weather especially stressful family breakups but did not mitigate bad feelings about the divorce. The results illustrate the situational and relational nature of effective social support in families. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Abbey, C., Dallos, R., The experience of the impact of divorce on sibling relationships: A qualitative study (2004) Clinical Child Psychology and Psychiatry, 9, pp. 241-259; Afifi, T.D., McManus, T., Hutchinson, S., Baker, B., Inappropriate parental divorce disclosures, the factors that prompt them, and their impact on parents' and adolescents' well-being (2007) Communication Monographs, 74, pp. 78-102; Amato, P.R., Keith, B., Parental divorce and the well-being of children: A meta-analysis (1991) Psychological Bulletin, 110, pp. 26-46; Bank, S., Kahn, M.D., Sisterhood-brotherhood is powerful: Sibling subsystems and family therapy (1975) Family Process, 14, pp. 311-337; Bank, S., Kahn, M.D., (1982) The sibling bond, , New York, NY: Basic Books; Barrera, M., Sandler, I.N., Ramsey, T.B., Preliminary development of a scale of social support: Studies on college students (1981) American Journal of Community Psychology, 9, pp. 435-447; Baxter, L.A., Braithwaite, D.O., Nicholson, J.H., Turning points in the development of blended families (1999) Journal of Social and Personal Relationships, 16 (3), pp. 291-313; Bryant, B.K., Sibling caretaking: Providing emotional support during middle childhood (1992) Children's sibling relationships: Developmental and clinical issues, pp. 55-69. , In: Boer F., Dunn J., editors Hillsdale, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates; Burleson, B.R., Age, social-cognitive development, and the use of comforting strategies (1984) Communication Monographs, 51, pp. 140-153; Burleson, B.R., Explaining recipient responses to supportive messages: Development and tests of a dual-process explanation (2010) New directions in interpersonal communication research, pp. 159-179. , In: Smith S.

Despite constant efforts to promote mammography in Australia to facilitate early detection, screening rates through the national mammography screening service remain at just 57%. Based on a theoretical rationale informed by Family Communication Patterns theory, the current study used semi-structured interviews with Australian mother-daughter dyads (N = 8) to examine their health communication, with a view to exploring the potential for daughters to deliver mammography promotion messages to their mothers. Consistent with results of previous studies conducted in different cultural contexts, the Australian mothers and daughters in this sample frequently communicated about health topics. Daughters were a source of information and influence for their mother's health decision making. The delivery of mammography promotion messages to the mother by the daughter may be most successful for dyads that value bidirectional conversation. Aspects of the Australian culture may facilitate the success of this strategy. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Arnett, J.J., Suffering, selfish, slackers?

Participants included 213 young adult children. Preliminary analyses revealed an inverse association between family conformity and young adults' self-esteem, a positive relationship between mothers' and fathers' authoritativeness and self-esteem, and a positive relationship between perceptions of mothers' permissiveness and young adults' depression. Hierarchical regression analyses provided no evidence to suggest that parenting styles moderate the association between family conformity orientation and young adults' self-esteem and depression. However, the results revealed small, but meaningful positive effects for both mothers' and fathers' authoritativeness on young adults' self-esteem, as well as a positive main effect for family conformity on depression. Two additional analyses of covariance revealed that young adults from pluralistic families had higher self-esteem and lower depression than young adults from protective, laissez faire, and consensual families. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Aiken, L.S., West, S.G., (1991) Multiple regression: Testing and interpreting interactions, , Newbury Park, CA: Sage; Applegate, J.L., Burke, J.A., Burleson, B.R., Delia, J.G., Kline, S.L., Reflection-enhancing parental communication (1985) Parental belief systems: The psychological consequences for children, pp. 107-142. , In: Sigel T.

However, measurement of parental rules regarding adolescent alcohol use has not been thoroughly studied. This study used qualitative interviews with 174 parents of older teens from 100 families. From open-ended questions, themes emerged that describe explicit rules tied to circumscribed use, no tolerance, and ""call me."" There was some inconsistency in explicit rules with and between parents. Responses also generated themes relating to implicit rules such as expectations and preferences. Parents described their methods of communicating their position via conversational methods, role modeling their own behavior, teaching socially appropriate use of alcohol by offering their teen alcohol, and monitoring their teens' social activities. Findings indicate that alcohol rules are not adequately captured by current assessment measures. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Abar, C., Abar, B., Turrisi, R., The impact of parental modeling and permissibility on alcohol use and experienced negative drinking consequences in college (2009) Addictive Behaviors, 34, pp. 542-547; Ary, D.V., Tildesley, E., Hops, H., Andrews, J.A., The influence of parent, sibling, and peer modeling and attitudes on adolescent use of alcohol (1993) International Journal of the Addictions, 28 (9), pp. 853-880; Baxter, L.A., Bylund, C.L., Imes, R., Routsong, T., Parent-child perceptions of parental behavioral control through rule-setting for risky health choices during adolescence (2009) Journal of Family Communication, 9 (4), pp. 251-271; Eaton, D.K., Kann, L., Kinchen, S., Shanklin, S., Ross, J., Hawkins, J., Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance - United States, 2007 (2008) Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, , Retrieved SS-4, 57; Harrison, P.A., Fulkerson, J.A., Park, E., The relative importance of social versus commercial sources in youth access to tobacco, alcohol, and other drugs (2000) Preventive Medicine: An International Journal Devoted to Practice & Theory, 31 (1), pp. 39-48; Jackson, C., Henriksen, L., Dickinson, D., Alcohol-specific socialization, parenting behaviors and alcohol use by children (1999) Journal of Alcohol Studies, 60 (3), pp. 362-367; Kelly, K.J., Comello, M.L.G., Hunn, L.C.P., Parent-Child Communication, Perceived Sanctions Against Drug Use, and Youth Drug Involvement (2002) Adolescence, 37, pp. 775-787; Miles, M.B., Huberman, A.M., (1994) Qualitative data analysis: An expanded sourcebook, , 2nd, Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage Publications; Miller-Day, M., Dodd, A.H., Toward a descriptive model of parent-offspring communication about alcohol and other drugs (2004) Journal of Social and Personal Relationships, 21 (1), pp. 69-91; Muhr, T., (2006) ATLAS.ti, Version 5.2, , Berlin: Scientific Software Development; Ryan, G.W., Bernard, H.R., Techniques to identify themes (2003) Field Methods, 15 (1), pp. 85-109; Sieving, R.E., Maruyama, G., Williams, C.L., Perry, C.L., Pathways to adolescent alcohol use: Potential mechanisms of parent influence (2000) Journal of Research on Adolescence, 10 (4), pp. 489-514; Turrisi, R., Jaccard, J., Taki, R., Dunnam, H., Grimes, J., Examination of the short-term efficacy of a parent intervention to reduce college student drinking tendencies (2001) Psychology of Addictive Behaviors, 15 (4), pp. 366-372; Turrisi, R., Wiersma, K.A., Hughes, K.K., Binge-drinking-related consequences in college students: Role of drinking beliefs and motherâ€""teen communications (2000) Psychology of Addictive Behaviors, 14 (4), pp. 342-355; van der Vorst, H., Engels, R.C.M.E., Meeus, W., Dekovic, M., The impact of alcohol-specific rules, parental norms about early drinking and parental alcohol use on adolescents' drinking behavior (2006) Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry, and Allied Disciplines, 47 (12), p. 1299; van der Vorst, H., Engels, R.C.M.E., Meeus, W., Dekovic, M., van Leeuwe, J., The role of alcohol-specific socialization in adolescents' drinking behaviour (2005) Addiction, 100 (10), pp. 1464-1476; van Zundert, R.M.P., van der Vorst, H., Vermulst, A.A., Engels, R.C.M.E., Pathways to alcohol use among Dutch students in regular education and education for adolescents with behavioral problems: The role of parental alcohol use, general parenting practices, and alcohol-specific parenting practices (2006) Journal of Family Psychology, 20 (3), pp. 456-467; Williams, S.S., Mulhall, P.F., Where public school students in Illinois get cigarettes and alcohol: Characteristics of minors who use different sources (2005) Prevention Science, 6 (1), pp. 47-57; Yu, J., The association between parental alcohol-related behaviors and children's drinking (2003) Drug & Alcohol Dependence, 69 (3), pp. 253-262","Bourdeau, B.; Prevention Research Center, Pacific Institute for Research and Evaluation Berkeley, 1995 University Avenue, Suite 450, Berkeley, CA 94704, United States; email: bbourdeau@prev.org",,,,,,,,15267431,,,,English,J.

These variables were tested via three hypotheses: distressful ideals, unmet ideals, and discrepancy evaluations. Despite some support for all hypotheses, the associations between standards and relational quality varied slightly between the two communication behaviors. For supportive communication, the unmet ideals and discrepancy evaluations hypotheses yielded greater associations than the distressful ideals hypothesis. For family disclosure, the unmet ideals hypothesis resulted in the strongest associations. Results are discussed in regard to further inclusion of standards within the context of in-law relationships. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Adler, L.L., Davis, W.M., Ahmed, R., Mrinal, N.R., Mukherji, B.R., Morgan, N., The perception of mother-in-law and father-in-law: A cross-cultural perspective (1989) International Journal of Group Tensions, 19, pp. 245-254; Adler, L.L., Denmark, F.L., Ahmed, R.A., Attitudes toward mother-in-law and stepmother: A cross-cultural study (1989) Psychological Reports, 65, p. 1194; Ambert, A.M., Relationships with former in-laws after divorce: A research note (1988) Journal of Marriage and the Family, 50, pp. 679-686; Bachman, G.F., Guerrero, L.K., Relational quality and communicative responses following hurtful events in dating relationships: An expectancy violations analysis (2006) Journal of Social and Personal Relationships, 23, pp. 943-963; Banker, B.S., Gaertner, S.L., Achieving stepfamily harmony: An intergroup-relations approach (1998) Journal of Family Psychology, 12 (2), pp. 310-325; Baucom, D.H., Epstein, N., Daiuto, A.D., Carels, R.A., Rankin, L.A., Burnett, C.K., Cognitions in marriage: The relationship between standards and attributions (1996) Journal of Family Psychology, 10, pp. 209-222; Baucom, D.H., Epstein, N., Rankin, L.A., Burnett, C.K., Assessing relationship standards: The inventory of specific relationship standards (1996) Journal of Family Psychology, 10, pp. 72-88; Baucom, D.H., Epsteim, N., Sayers, S., Sher, T.G., The role of cognitions in marital relationships: Definitional, methodological, and conceptual issues (1989) Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology, 57, pp. 31-38; Bonnesen, J.L., Hummert, M.L., Painful self-disclosures of older adults in relation to aging stereotypes and perceived motivations (2002) Journal of Language and Social-Psychology, 21, pp. 275-301; Bryant, C.M., Conger, R.D., Meehan, J.M., The influence of in-laws on change in marital success (2001) Journal of Marriage and Family, 63, pp. 614-626; Burgoon, J.K., Interpersonal expectations, expectancy violations, and emotional communication (1993) Journal of Language and Social Psychology, 12, pp. 30-48; Caughlin, J.P., Family communication standards: What counts as excellent family communication and how are such standards associated with family satisfaction?

Drawing from relational dialectics theory (RDT) as well as other dialogic perspectives on forgiveness (e.g., Waldron & Kelley, 2008), we examined the complexity of communicating forgiveness in nonvoluntary relationships. Participants' experiences supported the idea that forgiveness is an ongoing process of communicative negotiations between and among family members. Consistent with previous research, participants also noted that they generally did not explicitly verbalize forgiveness of a family member. Ultimately, the degree to which participants judged their forgiveness as successful often depended on whether the hurtful situation or forgiveness itself was centered in the family relationship. Furthering our understanding of communicating forgiveness in nonvoluntary relationships expands our perspective on the complex nature of families. © 2012 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Afifi, W., Falato, W., Weiner, J., Identity concerns following a serious relational transgression: The role of discovery method for the relational outcomes of infidelity (2001) Journal of Social and Personal Relationships, 18, pp. 291-308; Afifi, W., Metts, S., Characteristics and consequences of expectation violations in close relationships (1998) Journal of Social and Personal Relationships, 15, pp. 365-392; Bachman, G., Guerrero, L., (2003) Relations among apology, forgiveness, and communicative responses to hurtful messages, , San Diego, CA: Paper presented at the meeting of the International Communication Association; Baxter, L.A., Dialogues of relating (2004) Dialogue theorizing difference in communication studies, pp. 107-124. , In: Anderson R.

Results showed that the problem-solving style was perceived to be used most by the husband, followed by the accommodating, avoiding, and competing styles. In addition, the problem-solving and accommodating styles were positively associated, whereas the competing and avoiding styles were negatively associated with judgments of communication appropriateness and effectiveness, and the relational satisfaction variables. Furthermore, results indicated a moderator effect of shared family identity on the associations between perceptions of the husband's conflict management styles and relational satisfaction with the mother-in-law. Implications of the findings were discussed with reference to the prior literature on interpersonal conflict management, the Common Ingroup Identity Model, family relationships, as well as culture change in China. © 2012 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Afifi, T.D., McManus, T., Steuber, K., Coho, A., Verbal avoidance and dissatisfaction in intimate conflict situations (2009) Human Communication Research, 35, pp. 357-383; Aiken, L.S., West, S.G., (1991) Multiple regression: Testing and interpreting interactions, , Newbury Park, CA: Sage Publications; Altman, I., Brown, B.B., Staples, B., Werner, C.M., A transactional approach to close relationships: Courtship, weddings, and placemaking (1992) Person-environment psychology: Models and perspectives, pp. 193-242. , In: Walsh W.

The present study used a relational dialectics approach to analyze communication of family members (both transgender and not) about transgender identity and transition via online postings to discussion forums. Results showed three sites of struggle present for family members and partners, as well as transgender persons: Presence vs. Absence, Sameness vs. Difference, and Self vs. Other. The presence-absence and sameness-difference struggles centered on family members' and partners' experiences with grief surrounding the transgender person's transition process and the self-other struggle was centered on the issue of support. The tensions illustrated in the data, and especially the experience of loss, indicate that family members and spouses/partners of transgender persons may struggle with meaning-making surrounding a transition in sex and/or gender identity. This struggle over meaning suggests that sex and gender are fundamental to the ways in which we conceptualize and interact with relational partners and that when they change, we may conceptualize and relate to partners/relatives differently. © 2012 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"(1994) Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, , Washington, DC: American Psychiatric Association DSM-IV,American Psychiatric Association; Baxter, L.A., Relational dialectics theory (2006) Engaging theories in family communication: Multiple perspectives, pp. 130-145. , In: Braithwaite D.

Hypothesis One predicted that parental conformity orientation would predict sons' and daughters' reports of IPV perpetration and victimization, whereas Hypothesis Two predicted that parental conversation orientation would predict sons and daughters reports of their own use of and an intimate partner's use of negotiation tactics. Both hypotheses received partial support. The results suggest that parent communication patterns have the potential to be both a risk and protective factor for young adult children's involvement in IPV. The findings also draw attention to important differences in the relationships that mothers and fathers have with their children, and differences between parent and child perspectives on parent communication. © 2012 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Arriaga, X.B., Foshee, V.A., Adolescent dating violence: Do adolescents follow in their friends', or their parents', footsteps?

A significant amount of research on the interpersonal qualities of the parent-child relationship has been conducted. A gap in knowledge regarding opposite-sex parent-child relationships, however, continues to exist. The purpose of this project was to identify significant life events that either increased or decreased closeness within the mother/son relationship, thereby altering the relational quality of the dyad. Using a critical incident methodology, 138 sons and 57 mothers (not related) participated in the study. Sons reported 130 critical incidents affecting closeness with his mother, resulting in six major categories of events. Mothers reported 72 critical incidents affecting closeness with her son, resulting in seven major categories of events. Both mothers and sons found considerable agreement concerning the moments affecting their perceptions of closeness. Issues of social support, family crisis, distance, and conflict emerged as significant experiences through which mother/son closeness is maintained or inhibited. © 2012 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Boyum, L.A., Parke, R.D., The role of family emotional expressiveness in the development of children's social competence (1995) Journal of Marriage and the Family, 57, pp. 593-608; Branch, W.T., Use of critical incident reports in medical education: A perspective (2005) Journal of General Internal Medicine, 20, pp. 1063-1067; Bryant, A., Charmaz, K., (2007) The Sage handbook of grounded theory, , Los Angeles, CA: Sage Publications; Burleson, B.R., Emotional support skills (2003) Handbook of Communication and Social Interaction Skills, pp. 551-594. , In: Greene J.

Using a communication privacy management framework (Petronio, 2002), this study examined, through face-to-face, semi-structured interviews of 23 parents, what financial issues parents shared with their children and why parents chose to reveal or conceal this information. Interviews identified that parents relied on privacy boundaries and rules when determining whether to disclose private information to their children. If parents perceived more risks from the disclosure than rewards, or that talking about money was culturally unacceptable, they did not disclose. This study extends research on parent-child communication about money and offers practical implications for discussing a taboo topic. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Allen, M.W., Consumer finance and parent-child communication (2008) The Handbook of Consumer Finance Research, pp. 351-361. , J.

Oregon, Urbana, IL 61801, United States","The present study used dual reasoning from communication privacy management theory and relational uncertainty to investigate how parents-in-law protected privacy boundaries within the parentand child-in-law dyad. More specifically, the links among relational uncertainty, topic avoidance, family in-group status, and satisfaction were explored. Study 1 (N = 59) provided descriptive data on categories of parent-in-law relational uncertainty. These categories generated a measure of parent-in-law relational uncertainty employed in Study 2 (N = 104). Findings from Study 2 revealed intriguing interactions among family in-group status, relational uncertainty, and topic avoidance. In addition, relational uncertainty was negatively associated with family in-group status and parent-in-law satisfaction. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Afifi, T.D., Feeling caught in stepfamilies: Managing boundary turbulence through appropriate communication privacy rules (2003) Journal of Social and Personal Relationships, 20, pp. 729-755; Afifi, T.D., Joseph, A., The standards for openness hypothesis: A gendered explanation for why avoidance is so dissatisfying (2009) Uncertainty, Information Management, and Disclosure Decisions: Theories and Applications, pp. 341-362. , T.

The current investigation seeks to identify differences in the amount of social support received in adult sibling relationships. The sample consisted of 411 participants in 6 different types of sibling relationships: identical twins, fraternal twins, full biological siblings, half-biological siblings, stepsiblings, and adopted siblings. Employing of ideas of discriminative parental solicitude, we developed a hypothesis about which types of siblings receive the most social support from their siblings. The basic prediction was that siblings who are more genetically related to one another receive more social support than siblings who are less genetically related. Results supported these predictions, even when social and relational explanations were controlled. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Agnew, C.R., Loving, T.J., Le, B., Goodfriend, W., Thinking close: Measuring relational closeness as perceived self-other inclusion (2004) Handbook of Closeness and Intimacy, pp. 103-115. , D.

It is argued that the dominant image of contemporary masculinity and fatherhood is changing. During recent decades, debates and political ambitions concerning fatherhood have led to the construction of new ideals. In Sweden, reforms and information strategies are used to enhance and create the new father. The article focuses on men sharing the responsibility for their small children, and taking at least six months of parental leave. Through in-depth interviews and four case studies, these men's construction of fatherhood is studied. The results reveal some drastic changes towards equality and shared parenting in this group of fathers. The explanation is sought in a combination of class, status position, profession, and attitudes towards life and career. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Aarseth, H., (2008) Hemskapingens Moderne Magi, , Oslo: Institutt for sosiologi og samfunnsgeografi; Andersen, A., (2003) Men Skaper Rom for Foraldraskap Og Familie, , Trondheim: NTNU; Bekkengen, L., (2002) Man Får Välja - Om Föräldraskap Och Föräldraledighet I Arbetsliv Och Samhälle, , Malmö: Liber; Bekkengen, L., Föräldralediga män och barnorienterad maskulinitet (2003) Manlighetens Många Ansikten - Fäder, Feminister, Frisörer Och Andra Män, , T.

Changes in information seeking intentions and behaviors between adolescence and emerging adulthood were also examined. Data from 119 infant-placed adoptees and their adoptive mothers were used from Waves 2 (1996-2000) and 3 (2005-2008) of the Minnesota-Texas Adoption Research Project (Grotevant & McRoy, 1998). Adoptive mothers' Communicative Openness was positively associated with degree of information seeking in emerging adulthood. Degree of information seeking between adolescence (Wave 2) and emerging adulthood (Wave 3) increased for the majority of adoptees (62.2%). Approximately 16% of adoptees experienced no change in information seeking and 22% of adoptees experienced a decrease in information seeking. Females were more likely to exhibit a greater increase in information seeking change between Waves 2 and 3 and information seeking at Wave 3 than males. Results suggest that adoptee information seeking is a dynamic process that takes place over several life stages and that open communication about adoption within the adoptive family supports adoptee information seeking. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Arnett, J.J., Emerging adulthood: A theory of development from the late teens through the twenties (2000) American Psychologist, 55, pp. 469-480; Aumend, S.A., Barrett, M.C., Self-concept and attitudes toward adoption: A comparison of searching and nonsearching adult adoptees (1984) Child Welfare, 63, pp. 251-259; Baxter, L.A., Relationships as dialogues (2004) Personal Relationships, 11, pp. 1-22; Berger, C., Strategic and nonstrategic information acquisition (2002) Human Communication Research, 28, pp. 287-297; Bertocci, D., Schechter, M.D., Adopted adults' perception of their need to search: Implications for clinical practice (1991) Smith College Studies in Social Work, 61, pp. 179-196; Borders, L.D., Penny, J.M., Portnoy, F., Adult adoptees and their friends: Current functioning and psychosocial well-being (2000) Family Relations, 49, pp. 407-418; Brodzinsky, D.M., Reconceptualizing openness in adoption: Implications for theory, research, and practice (2005) Psychological Issues in Adoption: Research and Practice, pp. 145-166. , D.

The first three discursive struggles were constructed through the discursive practice of the hidden polemic, privileging positively valenced discourses over competing negative discourses.

Both interpretive and critical perspectives are utilized to uncover the complex nature of identity negotiations. Interviews with intercultural families reveal that their identity locations are negotiated from historical contexts and gender and racial ideologies. Ambivalence, contradictions, dialectical tensions, and the intersectionality of their identities are often mentioned in the interviews. Particularly in talking about their childrearing process, the parents negotiate multiple identities and manage dialectical tensions of their children's possible future identities. In general, the results show that intercultural families created a unique and secure space to navigate the social, economic, and political climates in the United States and Japan. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Adams, J., This is not where I belong!

Using a grounded interpretive approach and the theoretical lenses of intersectionalities and socialization messages, we found that children engaged in four communicative processes that intersected across cultural differences: (a) acting as designers of their own careers; (b) extracting cues to make sense of careers; (c) articulating meaningfulness based on local contexts, and (d) participating in families' concerted cultivation and/or natural growth practices. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,Funding was provided by the Purdue University College of Engineering’s INSPIRE (Institute for P-12 Engineering Research and Learning) program.,,"Arthur, M.B., Inkson, K., Pringle, J.K., (1999) The new careers: Individual action and economic change, , London: Sage; Bass, L., (2004) Child labor in Sub-Saharan Africa, , Boulder, CO: Lynne Rienner; Bass, L., Childhood in sociology and society: The US perspective (2010) Current Sociology, 58, pp. 335-350; Baxter, L.A., Montgomery, B.M., (1996) Relating: Dialogues and dialectics, , New York, NY: Guilford; Bell, E.L.J., Nkomo, S.M., (2001) Our separate ways: Black and white women and the struggle for professional identity, , Boston, MA: Harvard University Press; Berkelaar, B., Buzzanell, P.M., Kisselburgh, C., ""First, it's dirty, Second, it's dangerous, Third, it's insulting"": Chinese children talk about work and careers (2009) The National Communication Association Conference, , (November), Paper presented to, Chicago, Illinois; Blau, P.M., Duncan, O.D., (1967) The American occupational structure, , New York, NY: Wiley; Borgen, F., Betz, N., Career self-efficacy and personality: Linking career confidence and the healthy personality (2008) Journal of Career Assessment, 16, pp. 22-43; Bosley, S., Arnold, J., Cohen, L., How other people shape our careers: A typology drawn from career narratives (2009) Human Relations, 62, pp. 1487-1520; Broadfoot, K.J., Carlone, D., Medved, C., Aakhus, M., Gabor, E., Taylor, K., Meaning/ful work and organizational communication: Questioning boundaries, positionalities, and engagements (2008) Management Communication Quarterly, 22, pp. 152-161; Bronson, P., Merryman, A., The creativity crisis: For the first time, research shows that American creativity is declining.

Through the concepts of narrative inheritance, joint storytelling as a family, interactional sense-making, and family culture as local model, the series of stories reveal an underlying ""narrative momentum,"" which orients toward a future storytelling experience. Through this imagined future, the authors speculate on how the past and present are already writing a future that is still unfolding, yet exert tremendous influence on the way the family makes sense of their unique identity and culture. The work also situates international adoptive families as a category of the broader international family form and offers autoethnography as one way to study family storytelling. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Alemán, M.W., Helfrich, K.W., Inheriting the narratives of dementia: A collaborative tale of a daughter and mother (2010) Journal of Family Communication, 10, pp. 7-23; Bochner, A.P., Ellis, C., Tillmann-Healy, L.M., Relationships as stories (1997) Handbook of personal relationships: Theory, research, and intervention, pp. 307-324. , In S.

Focusing on characteristics of fathers derived from the life stories of trailblazing Druze women, it describes the unique relationship between fathers and their daughters and the role these men played in shattering gender roles and changing the status of women in society. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Abdel Kader, S., (1987) Egyptian women in a changing society, 1899-1987, , London: Lynne Rienner; Abu-Baker, K., (1998) Unpaved way: Arab women as political leaders in Israel, , Jerusalem: Van Leer Institute.

Reported conflict episodes were coded on: 1) topical content, 2) conflict strategy used by the parents, 3) conflict strategy used by the young adults, 4) outcome, and 5) reported consequences of the conflict. In both countries, four categories of conflict were identified: life and educational decisions, social and socializing behavior, moral or appropriate codes of conduct, and parent's behavior. Japanese young adults reported integration strategies most frequently for themselves and for their parents. American young adults reported that they used avoidance and their parents used distributed strategies most frequently. In both countries, parents got the final words more than the young adults did. Significantly more reciprocity (i.e., use of same conflict strategies by parent and young adult) was observed in Japanese accounts than in the American accounts. Results are considered in light of cultural variability and relational communication practices in the United States and Japan. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Barber, C.E., Haddock, S.A., Self-perceptions of comparative power and worth in three generational families (2003) Contemporary Family Therapy, 25 (2), pp. 229-245; Bell, D.C., Bell, L.G., Nakata, Y., Bell, E.M., Connection and individuality in Japan and the United States: Gender, culture, and conception of family health (1996) Journal of Gender, Culture, and Health, 1 (4), pp. 277-294; Bochner, A.P., On the efficacy in the development of close relationships (1982) Communication Yearbook 6, pp. 109-123. , In M.

However, Alberts et al. appear to endorse a particular and arbitrary standard for domestic labor when they move from identifying causes of heterosexual partners' typically unequal investment in domestic labor to ascribing value to these differences in behavior based on a standard that is not derived from or endorsed by both partners. From a critical perspective, it seems unwise to assume, without convincing data and argument, that women's typically higher standard of domestic labor is better. Endorsing women's typically higher standard also has potential to reinscribe gender socialization and its impact on many women's identities. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Alberts, J., Tracy, S., Tretheway, A., An integrative theory of the division of domestic labor: Threshold level, social organizing, and sensemaking (2011) Journal of Family Communication, 11, pp. 21-38; Bianchi, S., Robinson, J., Milkie, M., (2006) Changing Rhythms of American Family Life, , New York: Russell Sage Foundation; Blumer, H., (1969) Symbolic Interactionism: Perspective and Method, , Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice-Hall; Braithwaite, D.W., Bach, B.W., Baxter, L.A., Diverniero, R., Hammonds, J.R., Hosek, A.M., Willer, E.K., Wolf, B.M., Constructing family: A typology of voluntary kin (2010) Journal of Social and Personal Relationships, 27, pp. 388-407; Brooks, D., The lean years (2010) New York Times, pp. A23. , (February 16); Cancian, F., The feminization of love (1986) Signs, 11, pp. 692-709; Cancian, F., (1989) Love in America: Gender and Self-development, , Cambridge, MA: Cambridge University Press; Chethik, N., (2008) VoiceMale: What Husbands Really Think About their Marriages, their Wives, Sex, Housework and Commitment, , New York: Simon & Schuster; Clark, M.S., Quellette, R., Powell, M.C., Milberg, S., Recipient's mood, relationship type, and helping (1987) Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 53, pp. 93-103; (2010) Unconventional Wisdom, , http://www.contemporaryfamilies.org/all/unconventional-wisdom-issue-3.html?q=unconventional+wisdom, Council on Contemporary Families, Accessed April 14, 2010; de Maris, A., The role of relationship inequity in marital disruption (2007) Journal of Social and Personal Relationships, 24, pp. 177-195; de Maris, A., The 20-year trajectory of marital quality in enduring marriages: Does equity matter?

University St., West Lafayette, IN 47907, United States","Inspired by Alberts, Tracy, and Trethewey's (2011, this issue) construct of the threshold of intolerance and yet concerned that the conceptualization did not incorporate a rhetorical component in its explanation of the division of domestic labor and frustration of inequitable distribution of that labor, I propose a rhetorical theory. The rhetorical theory of the domestic division of labor is grounded in five dialectics: the dialectic of absence/\presence, dialectic of ownership, dialectic of dependence/\independence, dialectic of identity, and dialectic of narrative disintegration. This rhetorical dialectical theory is applied to three previously published narratives. An interpretive analysis, guided by the dialectics, follows. Finally, contemporary cultural/rhetorical constructions and personal stories of the domestic division of labor are provided. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Alberts, J.K., Tracy, S.J., Trethewey, A., An integrative theory of the division of domestic labor: Threshold level, social organizing and sensemaking (2011) Journal of Family Communication, 11, pp. 21-38. , this issue; Bateson, G., (1972) Steps to An Ecology of the Mind, , New York: Ballatine; Chethik, N., (2006) Voice Male: What Husbands Really Think About their Marriages, their Wives, Sex, Housework and Commitment, , New York: Simon & Shuster; Clair, R.P., (1998) Organizing Silence: A World of Possibilities, , Albany, NY: SUNY; Clair, R.P., McConnell, M., Bell, S., Hackbarth, K., Mathes, S., (2008) Why Work: The Perceptions of a ""real Job"" and the Rhetoric of Work Through the Ages, , West Lafayette, IN: Purdue University Press; Coontz, S., (2005) The Way We Really Are: Coming to Terms with America's Changing Families, , New York, NY: Basic Books; de Certeau, M., (1984) The Practice of Everyday Life, , Berkeley: University of California Press; Durkheim, E., (1984) The Division of Labor in Society, , (W.D.

Wood and Robin Patric Clair (2011, this issue): that we are establishing a ruler for the division of domestic; that our theory is biased toward the over-performer's rule or standard; that disagreements over domestic labor are primarily narrative constructions; and that our theory suggests a less than sanguine view of the potential for change in how men and women are socialized regarding the performance of domestic labor. In so doing, we argue that what Julia T. Wood describes as a ""ruler"" is not ours to create but rather is specific to each dyad and typically established by the partner with the lowest threshold level, be it a woman or a man. We also maintain that while a narrative approach provides a way to understand couples' interpretations of their experience, we believe a distinct value of our integrative theory is in helping to explain behavior and offer redress where such is needed. Finally, we argue that although our perspective regarding change may seem less than sanguine, that simply waiting for change to occur is of little benefit to those individuals and marriages/relationships suffering from lack of change in the here and now. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Chethik, N., (2006) VoiceMale: What Husbands Really Think About their Marriages, their Wives, Sex, Housework, and Commitment, , New York: Simon & Schuster; Clair, R.C., The rhetoric of dust: Toward a rhetorical theory of the division of domestic labor (2011) Journal of Family Communication, 11, pp. 49-59. , (this issue); Wood, J.T., Which ruler do we use?

For example, disputes and arguments about chores rate amongst the most common and destructive in terms of relational conflict. Several theories have been developed to explain the division of household labor, but scholars have yet to be successful in explaining persistent differences in husbands' and wives' domestic contributions. As a step toward doing so, here we provide an integrative theory that builds upon singular explanations such as gender display and evolutionary/biosocial differences. In this paper, we incorporate these theories, introduce the importance of threshold level, and integrate concepts derived from self-organizing systems theory, the economy of gratitude, and individual, dyadic and social sensemaking processes. Together, these provide an integrated theory well suited to explore how couples' communicative practices both create and can ameliorate inequities in the division of domestic labor. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Babcock, L., Laschever, S., (2003) Women Don't Ask: Negotiation and The Gender Divide, , Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press; Baxter, J., To marry or not to marry: Marital status and the household division of labor (2005) Journal of Family Issues, 36, pp. 300-321; Baxter, J., Hewitt, B., Western, M., Post-familial families and the domestic division of labor (2005) Journal of Comparative Family Studies, 36, pp. 583-600; Bird, C.E., Gender, household labor, and psychological distress: The impact of the amount and division of housework (1999) Journal of Health and Social Behavior, 40, pp. 31-45; Bittman, M., Pixley, J., (1997) The Double Life of the Family: Myth, Hope and Experience, , St. Leonard's: Allen & Unwin; Blair, S.L., Lichter, D.T., Measuring the division of household labor: Gender segregation of household work among American couples (1991) Journal of Family Issues, 12, pp. 91-113; Blumberg, R.L., Goldman, M.T., A theoretical look at the gender balance of power in the American couple (1989) Journal of Family Issues, 10, pp. 225-250; Booker, R., For social insight, look to the insects (2004) Science & Theology News, Online Edition, , http://www.stnews.org/News-897.htm, March 1, Retrieved; Brayfield, A.A., Employment resources and housework in Canada (1992) Journal of Marriage and The Family, 54, pp. 19-30; Breshers, S.N., Fewell, J.H., (2001) Annual Review of Entomology, 46, pp. 313-340; Camazine, S., Deneubourg, J.L., Franks, N.R., Sneyd, J., Theraulaz, G., Bonabeau, E., (2001) Self-organization in Biological Systems, , Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press; (1997) Sex and Gender Differences in Personal Relationships, , Canary, D.

The study complements this work by examining how various topics are engaged in parent-adolescent family communication. Specifically, it examines topical differences in dialogic expansiveness, conceptualized with Bakhtin's dialogism theory as the extent to which all interactants' viewpoints are encouraged and legitimated. Operationalized through topic-specific reports about conversation orientation and conformity orientation provided independently by 122 parents and their late-adolescent children, the study reconceptualized family communication patterns from a traitlike to a state-like feature of communication. Results identified four distinct clusters of topics, two of which were dialogically contractive: the single topical domain of sexual issues and the cluster consisting of the three topics of drinking/drugs/smoking, money matters, and educational progress. Topics related to adolescent friendships and everyday things occupied a dialogic expansive cluster. Four topics emerged with nondescript patterns: adolescent dating, family relationship rules, family relationship concerns, and traditions. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Afifi, W.A., Burgoon, J.K., ""We never talk about that"": A comparison of cross-sex friendships and dating relationships on uncertainty and topic avoidance (1998) Personal Relationships, 5, pp. 255-272; Afifi, W.A., Guerrero, L.K., Some things are better left unsaid, II: Topic avoidance in friendships (1998) Communication Quarterly, 46, pp. 231-249; Aldendenfer, M., Blashfield, R., (1984) Cluster Analysis, , Beverly Hills, CA: Sage; Allen, G., (2000) Intertextuality, , New York: Routledge; Altman, I., Taylor, D., (1973) Social Penetration: The Development of Interpersonal Relationships, , New York Holt, Rinehart & Winston; Aries, E., Johnson, F., Close friendship in adulthood: Conversational content between same-sex friends (1983) Sex Roles, 9, pp. 1183-1195; Bakhtin, M.M., Discourse in the novel (1981) The Dialogic Imagination: Four Essays By M.

Grounded in the interpretive paradigm, the researchers conducted interviews with 25 adopted adults. We determined that the adoptees in this study experienced uncertainty about what their adoption means, details about their birth parents, and their adoptive parents' feelings about the birth parents. Individuals we interviewed were unmotivated, apprehensive, or unable to reduce their uncertainty. Participants reported that their adoptive parents helped them manage uncertainty by discussing the adoption story with adoptees, empowering adoptees to confront their uncertainty, and normalizing the adoption within their family. The findings of the current study extend researchers' understanding of the adoptee experience and of the communicative role of the adoptive parent. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Afifi, W., Matsunaga, M., Uncertainty management theories (2007) Engaging Theories In Interpersonal Communication, pp. 117-132. , In D.

Twenty-four mothers with infants or toddlers from low-income families who were beginning participation in an intergenerational learning program completed the Child Abuse Potential Inventory (CAPI; Milner, 1986) when they enrolled in the program. A family worker visited each family's home during the same week and administered the Infant-Toddler HOME Inventory (Caldwell & Bradley, 1984), a 45-minute interview and observation system that assesses the quality of stimulation and support available to a child in the home environment. Total scores from the CAPI and HOME Inventories were inversely associated (r = -0.61, p <.002), as were scores on the CAPI and two features of parenting represented by subscales of the HOME, regulation and stimulation. Contrary to expectations, the CAPI was not significantly inversely associated with the connection feature of parenting. Results suggest that researchers and family service providers need to consider how to help parents cope with sources of distress and problems in relationships because these markers for child abuse potential also impact multiple features of parenting in the home which in turn are associated with important developmental outcomes for children. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Ainsworth, M., Blehar, M., Waters, E., Wall, S., (1978) Patterns of Attachment.

The researcher completed an inductive analysis from data collected from 26 in-depth interviews and found that participants accounted for their reconciliation through active corrective facework (by updating family and accounting for reconciliation) and passive corrective facework (by choosing not to update family or account for reconciliation). The findings and interpretations shed light: (a) on how corrective facework is performed in ongoing relationships rather than one-time interactions or hypothetical situations, (b) the intersection between accounts and facework, and (c) the complexities of corrective facework. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Baxter, L.A., Pittman, G., Communicatively remembering turning points of relational development in heterosexual romantic relationships (2001) Communication Reports, 14, pp. 1-17; Baxter, L.A., Widenmann, S., Revealing and not revealing the status of romantic relationships to social networks (1993) Journal of Social and Personal Relationships, 10, pp. 321-337; Bergen, K.M., Negotiating a ""questionable"" identity: Commuter wives and social networks (2010) Southern Communication Journal, 75, pp. 35-56; Bolton, C.D., Mate selection as the development of a relationship (1961) Marriage and Family Living, 23, pp. 234-240; Brown, P., Levinson, S.C., (1987) Politeness: Some Universals In Language Use, , Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press; Bryant, C., Conger, R., Meehan, J.M., The influence of in-laws on change in marital success (2001) Journal of Marriage and The Family, 63, pp. 614-626; Caughlin, J.P., Afifi, T.D., When is topic avoidance unsatisfying?

It utilized accommodation theory and its connection to commitment to form hypotheses, which predicted connections between the independent variables of attachment style and gender and the dependent variables of relational repair strategies and types of commitment. Multivariate analysis of variance found evidence for an attachment style explanation for the use of relational repair items but did not find the predicted gender connection. There was also a limited connection between attachment style and commitment but none between gender and commitment. Implications for future research involving direct comparisons between once-married and remarried persons and between persons remarried more than once were discussed. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Aune, R.K., Metts, S., Ebesu Hubbard, A.S., Managing outcomes of discovered deception (1998) Journal of Social Psychology, 138, pp. 677-689; Bartholomew, K., Avoidance of intimacy: An attachment perspective (1990) Journal of Social and Personal Relationships, 7, pp. 147-178; Baxter, L.A., Dindia, K., Marital partners' perceptions of marital maintenance strategies (1990) Journal of Social and Personal Relationships, 7, pp. 187-208; Baxter, L.A., Simon, E.P., Relationship maintenance strategies and dialectical contradictions in personal relationships (1993) Journal of Social and Personal Relationships, 10, pp. 242-255; Bello, R.S., Brandau-Brown, F.E., Ragsdale, J.D., Attachment style, marital satisfaction, commitment, and communal strength effects on relational repair message interpretation among remarrieds (2008) Communication Quarterly, 56, pp. 1-16; Bippus, A.M., Rollin, E., Attachment style differences in relational maintenance and conflict behaviors: Friends' perceptions (2003) Communication Reports, 16, pp. 113-123; Bollen, K., Lennox, R., Conventional wisdom on measurement: A structural equation perspective (1991) Psychological Bulletin, 110, pp. 305-314; Bowlby, J., (1969) Attachment (Attachment and Loss, 1. , New York: Basic Books; Brandau-Brown, F.E., Ragsdale, J.D., Two cultures: A gendered approach to commitment and relational repair in marriage (2005) Intercultural Communication Studies, 14, pp. 233-247; Brandau-Brown, F.E., Ragsdale, J.D., Personal, moral, and structural commitment and the repair of marital relationships (2008) Southern Communication Journal, 73, pp. 68-83; Brennan, K.A., Shaver, P.R., Tobey, A.E., Attachment styles, gender, and parental problem drinking (1991) Journal of Social and Personal Relationships, 8, pp. 451-466; Buunk, B., Mutsaers, W., Equity perceptions and marital satisfaction in former and current marriage: A study among the remarried (1999) Journal of Social and Personal Relationships, 16, pp. 123-132; Canary, D.J., Stafford, L., Relational maintenance strategies and equity in marriage (1992) Communication Monographs, 59, pp. 243-267; Canary, D.J., Stafford, L., Preservation of relational characteristics: Maintenance strategies, equity, and locus of control (1993) Interpersonal Communication: Evolving Interpersonal Relationships, pp. 237-259. , In P.

Becoming parents affects many family relationships, although the bulk of research has emphasized marriage and parents' relationships to their newborn. The current study is a qualitative analysis of new parents' relationships with their parents, the new grandparents. Twenty-three first-time parents completed semistructured interviews during which each identified changes in their relationship with either a parent or parent-in-law. New parents described the transitional period beginning from the date they announced the pregnancy to the future grandparents. Through the Retrospective Interview Technique (Huston, Surra, Fitzgerald, & Cate, 1981), participants described 225 events that changed intergenerational relationships. Interviews were transcribed and analyzed inductively, resulting in 10 turning points. Guided by dialogic theory, the analysis included the valence (positive, negative, and both) and locus (internal and external to the dyad) of each turning point. Connection, Gifts, and some communicative turning points were found to be positive for intergenerational relationships, whereas Conflict and Face-Threatening Advice generally lowered satisfaction. Birth and several other turning points were multivocal, with both negative and positive evaluations by new parents. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,"An earlier version of this paper was presented at the 2008 National Communication Association conference in San Diego, CA.

However, in close relationships, people often experience shared stressors and jointly tell their shared stories of difficulty to others. Thus, joint storytelling processes likely also relate to individual health. We tested this expectation using a series of actor-partner interdependence models and path analyses in a study that included 68 couples' video-recorded joint storytelling interactions. Findings primarily indicate relationships between husbands', wives', and couples' storytelling behaviors and husbands' mental health. Generally speaking, however, storytelling behaviors did not predict wives' mental health. Interpretations, limitations, and directions for future research are discussed. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,"This research was supported by a University of Nebraska Layman Award.

These interactions, exemplified by questions such as ""Is she adopted?"" or ""Are your daughters real sisters?"" result from outsiders' observations of racial difference within some adoptive families. Past research has examined these interactions from the perspective of adoptive parents (Suter, 2008; Suter & Ballard, 2009; Tessler, Gamache, & Liu, 1999), but research on adoptees' perspectives on these interactions has been lacking. This study examines retrospective reports of intrusive interactions and uses discourse dependency (Galvin, 2006) to examine family members' responses to them. Participants reported different types of interactions, including relational comments/questions, compliments, stares, mistaken identities, and adoptee-only interactions. Generally, these interactions elicited embarrassment or frustration, as adoptees desired to ""blend in"" and not be pitied. Parents were reported to have engaged in external boundary management strategies including labeling, explaining, defending, and joking. Some external boundary management strategies were reported to affirm adoptees' place in the family. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,"The author would like to thank her dissertation advisor, Valerie Manusov, as well as the editor of Journal of Family Communication and three anonymous reviewers for their helpful feedback.

Grounded in both Koerner and Fitzpatrick's (2002a) generalized family communication theory and Bandura's (1977) social cognitive theory, structural equation modeling tests a model whereby family communication patterns act as both direct and indirect (i.e., via communication competence) predictors. Results find support for both theoretical perspectives, albeit more strongly for Koerner and Fitzpatrick's approach. Practical application of these results suggests that high conversation and moderate conformity orientations most likely produce healthy attitudes toward online communication in young adult children. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Argyle, M., Henderson, M., The rules of friendship (1984) Journal of Social and Personal Relationships, 1, pp. 211-237; Arnett, J.J., Are college students adults?

This study examines how the intergenerational transfer of gynecological health care information between mothers and daughters may influence the health care-seeking behavior of AA adolescent women and their ability to speak openly with providers about sexual health concerns, including sexually transmitted infection (STI) and HIV prevention during clinical encounters. In-depth interviews were conducted with 17 AA women (ages 20-55) to elicit retrospective narrative accounts including reason for the first visit, decision to seek care, and mother-daughter communication regarding gynecological health care. Data were analyzed using Critical Incident Analysis (CIA). Most participants (70%) sought gynecological health care as adolescents based upon their mothers' recommendations. Many (59%) reported that the visit was not preventive. Participants (29%) reported that a lack of communication from mothers regarding gynecological health was critical to their ability to speak openly with providers. Knowledge gained from this study could increase mothers' as well as providers' ability to facilitate family gynecological health communication, which could decrease young women's risk of experiencing negative health outcomes including HIV. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,"Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education, ORISE

The current study explores the assumption that sexual communication is challenging through joint and individual interviews with nine mother-daughter dyads. Results of these close mother-daughter relationships revealed that sexual communication was and was not challenging for them. A relational dialectics framework revealed tensions between perceiving sex as a natural topic, and therefore relatively easy and communicatively open on one hand, and acknowledging some challenges with conversations about sex leading to closedness on the other. The results from this study show how some mothers and daughters are able to talk openly about sexual information and stand in contrast to other studies that show the challenging aspects of sexual communication. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Baxter, L.A., Montgomery, B.M., (1996) Relating: Dialogues & Dialectics, , New York: The Guilford Press; Baxter, L.A., Wilmot, W.W., Taboo topics in close relationships (1985) Journal of Social and Personal Relationships, 2, pp. 253-269; Blieszner, R., Close relationships over time (1994) Perspectives On Close Relationships, pp. 1-17. , In A.

Participants scoring highest on marital bond (a score ascertained from marital storytelling behaviors and representing positive perceptions of one's spouse and relationship) reported the highest levels of satisfaction and lowest levels of loneliness, flooding, and depression over time. There were significant differences between men and women on flooding, but for each of the other outcome variables, the couples with the lowest marital bond scores exhibited different gender patterns than the couples with higher marital bond scores. The identification of these precursors to divorce suggests therapeutic applications for relational history narratives. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,"National Institute of Mental Health, NIMH: MH42484

The purpose of the study was to investigate the process through which mothers tell their internationally adopted children the adoption story and the functions adoption stories serve for members of these families. Telephone interviews with eleven adoptive mothers illuminate the interactive and dynamic nature of adoption stories as well as myriad functions the storytelling process serves for both the adopted children and parents, namely, offering children positive reinforcement, building familiarity with adoption-related talk, conveying a complete history, and attempting to help children avoid fantasy. The findings provide important implications for researchers and adoptive parents by contributing to the Family Adoption Communication model and highlighting the unifying and educational nature of stories and the storytelling process. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Baxter, L.A., Relationships as dialogues (2004) Personal Relationships, 11, pp. 1-22; Bergen, K.M., Braithwaite, D.O., Identity as constituted in communication (2009) 21st Century Communication, , W.

First, we present narrative theory as a conceptual framework for moving beyond an individualistic understanding of health and healing. Second, we illustrate the efficacy of this position through an interpretive study of meaning-making about intergenerational diabetes among families living in rural Appalachian areas-contexts historically characterized by disproportionately high rates for numerous diseases including diabetes. Stories elicited from participants during interviews characterized their diabetes health legacies as dense and devastating. Our analysis illustrates how legacies evolve and shift across generations and shape how family members understand and manage diabetes, including the role of family members as intergenerational lynchpins and intergenerational buffers. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"(2008) All About Diabetes, , http://www.diabetes.org/about-diabetes.jsp, American Diabetes Association, Retrieved October 7, 2008; (2008) Counties In Appalachia, , http://www.arc.gov/index.do?nodeId=27, Appalachian Regional Commission, Retrieved October 19, 2008; (2004) Prevalence of Diabetes, , http://www.ohiou.edu/arhi/presentations/DiabetesFactors.pdf/, Appalachian Rural Health Institute, Retrieved October 19, 2008; (2006) Diabetes, , http://www.ohiou.edu/arhi/presentations/Diabetes_06_Final.pdf/, Appalachian Rural Health Institute, Retrieved on October 19, 2008; Behringer, B., Friedell, G.H., (2006) Appalachia: Where Place Matters In Health, , http://www.cdc.gov/Pcd/issues/2006/oct/06_0067.htm, Retrieved September 21, 2007, from CDC Preventing Chronic Disease from; Boje, D., (2001) Narrative Methods For Organizational and Communication Research, , Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage; Bruner, J., The narrative construction of reality (1991) Critical Inquiry, 18, pp. 1-21; Burke, K., (1969) A Grammar of Motives, , Berkeley, CA: University of California Press; Burke, K., (1984) Permanence and Change, , 3rd ed.).
