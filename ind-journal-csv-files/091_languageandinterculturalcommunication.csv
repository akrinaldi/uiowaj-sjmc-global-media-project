We further argue for a renewed relationship between the arts and intercultural citizenship education that explores sustained imagined worlds; stimulates empathy; promotes the critical development of languages towards dialogue; inspires social, cultural, and political action; and demands transformation. Lastly, we present the six papers that comprise this issue and document, illustrate, and examine art matters in languages and intercultural citizenship education. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","arts; Citizenship education; intercultural dialogue; interculturality; literature; poetry",,,,,,,"We would like to express our gratitude to Malcolm N.

However, willingness to communicate in a foreign language other than English is an issue less discussed. This case study is an attempt to clarify expats’ experience of living in Denmark and their willingness to communicate in Danish. The participants include representatives of different nationalities temporarily living as expats studying and/or working in Denmark. The findings suggest that expats’ willingness to communicate in Danish is highly influenced by their position in society, level of socialization with the Danes and knowledge of English. Voksende globalisering har medført en stigende interesse for at udvikle internationale studerendes evne til at kommunikere på et fremmedsprog. Der har imidlertid været mindre fokus på viljen til at kommunikere på et andet fremmedsprog end engelsk. Dette case studium er et forsøg på at afdække udlændinges oplevelse af at bo i Danmark samt af deres vilje til at kommunikere på dansk. Deltagerne i studiet er udlændinge betegnet som expats, der midlertidigt arbejder og/eller studerer i Danmark. Resultatet viser, at viljen til at kommunikere på dansk påvirkes af position i samfundet, grad af socialisering med danskerne samt kendskab til engelsk. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Cross-cultural communication; foreign language education; globalisation; intercultural awareness; intercultural dialogue; second language learning",,,,,,,,,,"Barrett, M., Byram, M., Lázár, I., Mompoint-Gaillard, P., Philippou, S., (2013) Developing intercultural competence through education.

We aim to reignite the debate about our role as public transformative intellectuals and to let advocacy and empowerment be embedded in our work. This calls for a shift in focus from the elite groups who have dominated the intercultural narrative to disenfranchised groups like refugees and (forced) migrant workers. We also reflect on our multi-positionality as scholars, and we present a dialectics of language, intercultural communication and social activism.

When telling their ‘narratives of flight’, our analytic focus, refugees demonstrate discursive agency and identities that conflict with a societal stereotype of vulnerability and helplessness that employers might expect.

It analyses speeches delivered by Ghana's independence leader, Kwame Nkrumah, and finds that he adopts an anti-imperialist and anti-establishment stance through three processes: his explicit identification of Africa's conspiratorial enemy, his sculpting of a gallant/heroic leader image and his projection of a messianic identity.

In particular, it exposes the diverse views students developed on the relationship between language and culture and the invaluable role of content courses in fostering students' development of critical cultural awareness and criticality. While there was evidence to suggest that all three strands of the curriculum (language, content and the year abroad) contributed to students' development of intercultural competence and criticality, content modules emerged as a key setting to foster critical discussions on interculturality. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","critical cultural awareness; criticality; culture; Intercultural communicative competence; language",,,,,,"University of Hull, HU","I would like to acknowledge the continuous support received from the University of Hull, my supervisors, as well as all the participating institutions that welcomed me and strongly supported my research project.",,,"Allen, H.W., In search of relevance: The standards and the undergraduate foreign language curriculum (2011) AAUSC 2009 volume: Principles and practices of the standards in college foreign language education, pp. 38-52. , Scott V., (ed), Boston: Heinle,.

By discussing the ‘right’ ground of mindfulness and a counter-example of ‘McMindfulness’, I learnt that the ‘good’ cannot be separated from ‘right’–a thorough contextualisation and an ethical orientation. I thus suggest that the ‘good’ interculturalist needs to (a) construct an ethical orientation for their understandings and practices in a particular context, and (b) use an intercultural ethic to deliberately engage with their knowledge-work in the increasingly interconnected world. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","good; hybrid; Intercultural ethics; interculturalist; knowledge; mindfulness",,,,,,,"I am grateful to Dr Richard Fay from the Manchester Institute of Education (at The University of Manchester, UK) for his invaluable engagement with my thinking and comments on drafts.

Conceptually, we combine insights from syncretic literacy studies with an approach to faith as cultural practice. We argue that a syncretic lens can be enriched by an explicit focus on children's faith-inspired texts as material objects that open up possibilities for new meaning making. Our analysis points to the exploration of faith identities as a process of becoming that can be open-ended and potentially unpredictable. Cet article examine la rédaction de textes inspirés par la foi de deux enfants d'héritage tamoul hindou/saiva sri-lankais et les conversations qui s'ensuivent autour de ces textes. Sur le plan conceptuel, nous combinons les connaissances tirées d'études sur les littératies syncrétiques avec une approche de la foi en tant que pratique culturelle. Cette approche syncrétique peut être enrichie par une focalisation explicite sur les textes en question en tant qu'objets matériels ouvrant des possibilités de créer de nouvelles significations. Notre analyse montre que l'exploration des identités religieuses est un processus de devenir parfois ouvert et potentiellement imprévisible. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","faith as cultural practice; faith identities; scrapbooks; Syncretic literacies; team ethnography",,,,,,"Economic and Social Research Council, ESRC

This kind of data makes it possible to recollect past experiences, envision future events and reﬂect on aspects of becoming or being multilingual subjects, including identity (re)construction and beliefs about languages and their use. We argue that the tasks in the studies can be applied to different groups of learners in FL education, offering space for reﬂection and enhancing agency in speciﬁc contexts of multilingualism. © 2020, © 2020 The Author(s).

However, recent technological developments have streamlined the provision of translated captions and these advances are influencing awareness of and attitudes to the use of surtitles in theatre spaces. Taking the ITA’s Roman Tragedies as an illustration, this article examines the application of surtitling technology in theatre translation. The intermedial performance of surtitles positions surtitles within new media dramaturgy, creating a form of interlinear translation. The dramaturgical effect of the integration of surtitles into production demonstrates how technological intervention can operate to co-produce the humanity of intercultural theatrical encounter. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Dramaturgy; interlinear translation; intermedial performance; surtitles; theatre translation",,,,,,,,,,"Alexander, C., Complicite–The Elephant Vanishes (2003/4)–‘The Elephant and Keeper Have Vanished Completely … They Will Never Be Coming Back’ (2010) Making contemporary theatre: International rehearsal processes, pp. 59-80. , Harvie J., Lavender A., (eds), Manchester University Press,.

We explore animation making as an assemblage in which all parts, human and non-human, play an agentive role, in shaping the story, the story making, and the story makers, mutually transforming each other. We posit that this engagement, by putting a strong emphasis on exploring the materiality of objects, produces a de- and reterritorializing effect. It favors exploring new relationships and identity positions, by breaking away, temporarily, from human-made, hierarchical systems of relationships, built on comparison, copying and competition, and by inviting experimentation and discovery of the ‘not yet known’ in a hierarchy flat, immersive, horizontally flowing process. ‘Animating objects’ decenters from the conventional meaning of objects, by broadening the ‘linguistic sign’ and the purpose and functionality of objects in daily life. It engages humans in forming empathetic relationships with objects, by humanizing and inter-acting with them, as if experimenting with an alter ego, or a new self. ‘Animating objects’ therefore has the potential to sensitize for and build empathetic capacity, not only in relation to the self-animated object, but also in relation to humans sharing a similar experience, wherein we see interesting potential for education in contexts of diversity, intercultural communication and beyond. We investigate the personal experience of the co-author, Gohar, as an identity journey and as a transformative process that emerged from the encounter between her and the carrots, her selected objects for story making. We draw on ethnographic, observational data, video-recordings, retrospective recorded and transcribed interviews, and reflective writing, which we analyse by making connections to theories of new materialism. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","collaborative ethnography; decentering language; Human-object-interaction; identity; intercultural communication; new materialism; socio-material assemblages",,,,,,,,,,"Anderson, J., Macleroy, V., (2016) Multilingual digital storytelling: Engaging creatively and critically with literacy, , Routledge, &, (eds; Bangou, F., Fleming, D., Deleuze and becoming-citizen: Exploring newcomer films in a Franco-Canadian secondary school (2014) Citizenship Teaching & Learning, 10 (1), pp. 63-77. , https://doi.org/10.1386/ctl.10.1.63_1; Barad, K., (2007) Meeting the universe halfway: Quantum physics and the entanglement of matter and meaning, , Duke University Press; Barrett, H., (2006) Researching and evaluating digital storytelling as a deep learning tool, , In C.

Likewise, the act of translation itself ceases to be the transfer of meaning from one bounded language to another, becoming something more fluid and dynamic. The discussion of this approach will be illustrated with examples from the author's recent translation of a Dutch novel into English which draws on the Deleuzean concept of 'becoming woman', rather than comprehension of vocabulary and grammar.

Building on the principles of transcaring, language socialisation and critical cosmopolitanism, I propose that adult and child engage in a transformative, two-way socialisation process as their cultural and linguistic repertoires are appraised and new meanings and understandings emerge. This socialisation enables them to develop essential dispositions to inhabit our globalised societies. The article also questions bounded conceptions around language, culture and belonging, foregrounding the complexity of life trajectories and cultural and linguistic repertoires in contexts of intense mobility and transnational interaction. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","After-school programmes; critical cosmopolitanism; language and cultural socialisation; plurilingualism; transcaring",,,,,,,,,,"Blackledge, A., Creese, A., (2016) IALIC 2016 Plenary Communication, , Translanguaging as cultural and cosmopolitan competence.

While the students struggled with essentialism in their exchanges, they retained a willingness to critique specific local cultural practices and challenged some of the usual discourses and familiar tropes associated with mobility and intercultural contact. The data highlights the importance of place in the students' reading and navigation of the world, the dialogic and iterative reformulation of their positions, their ability to deal with complexity through a critical cosmopolitan perspective, and a growing reflexive and ethical consciousness. This affirms our belief in the value of open-ended student dialogue as a strategy to encourage critical cosmopolitan dispositions, and underlines the need for greater nuance around conceptualising essentialism. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","critical cosmopolitanism; critical incidents; essentialism; Interculturality; micro-cultural practices",,,,,,,"The authors would like to thank our research participants for taking part in the study.

Data were obtained from interviews with Vietnamese students of English-medium programmes in Taiwanese universities. Findings suggest that the students, in managing their English and Chinese in interactions with people of diverse language backgrounds, shaped their social imaginary of their position in relation to these people. It is observed that proficiency in Chinese was significant for them to establish their connectedness with local people and the host society. Implications for better assisting international students in non-Anglophone countries are then suggested. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","contact zone; international students; Language practices; language use; social connectedness; social imaginary",,,,,,"Ministry for Foreign Affairs","I sincerely thank the two reviewers and the editor of Language and Intercultural Communication for their valuable comments and feedback on the earlier versions of this article.

This is a challenge, particularly as intercultural capability is still a new concept for many teachers. Drawing on data from a two-year project, this paper foregrounds student voices to reveal how beginner learners experienced language programmes where non-specialist intermediate school teachers facilitated comparative intercultural explorations for the first time. The findings indicate that shifts in teachers’ practices led to some worthwhile, although variable, intercultural learning gains.

Research examining young North Koreans’ adjustment to South Korean schools has reported that these students struggle with mandatory English classes and the prevalent use of English in the school system, often positioning themselves as peripheral in their new contexts. Additionally, existing research on North Korean students has mostly depicted this population as a group, often in comparison to South Korean students, rather than treating them as individual learners. The present study targeting four North Korean defectors traces how the participants value and scale English language practices across different spaces and how each individual navigates the English language as an adaptation tool in their new space. The results show that individual learners’ attitudes towards learning English are markedly different, which are complicated by their perceptions of their prior English learning experience in their home country and of the instrumentality of English in neoliberal contexts. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","English language learners; language attitudes; linguistic practices; North Korean defectors; spatial trajectories",,,,,,,,,,"Ager, A., Strang, A., Understanding integration: A conceptual framework (2008) Journal of Refugee Studies, 21 (2), pp. 166-191; Baik, J., Power and ideology in language of education: English textbooks of two Koreas (1995) The Sociolinguistic Journal of Korea, 3 (1), pp. 111-139; Blommaert, J., In and out of class, codes and control (2005) Dislocations/relocations: Narratives of displacement, pp. 127-143. , Baynham M., Anna D.F., (eds), Manchester: St Jerome,.

This study draws on Amadasi and Holliday's (2017) distinction of block narratives and thread narratives of culture and applies these to interviews with first year students. It shows that some ability to draw on thread narratives and therefore non-essentialist views of culture is in evidence from the start of students’ university careers. Universities need to implement policy and practice to foster the emergence of these abilities and thus enable students to acquire the attributes of a ‘global graduate’.

They transmit factual information and are used to appeal to emotions representing ‘symbolic rather than structural or semantic expression’. The current study investigates shop names in six Palestinian Arab localities in Israel employing quantitative and qualitative research methods. Photographs of 848 shop names from the six Palestinian Arab localities facilitated examining the type of names, scripts used, and the type of business. Six shop owners were interviewed about their shop names, types, and scripts. The findings reveal that Arabic is the most prominent language used, followed by foreign languages, with Hebrew far behind. Locality and type of business are found to be important factors, revealing that Palestinian Arab shop names are not homogeneous and certain languages are preferred in some businesses rather than others. Palestinian Arabs work on maintaining their Palestinian-Arab identity in the conflict-ridden Israeli reality. Besides, they are also influenced by Hebraisation through the exposure to Israeli culture and its values, as well as to globalization, which entails being connected with worldwide trends. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Arabisation; globalisation; Hebraisation; Israel; linguistic landscape; Shop names",,,,,,,,,,"Abu-Ghazaleh-Mahajneh, M., Language policy in institutions of higher education and its impact on Arab students (2010) Dirasat book 2010, pp. 83-87. , Jabareen Y., (ed), Nazareth: Dirasat, (In Arabic),.

Banal interculturalism emerges within discursive semiotic processes that allow the participants to display their (cultural) knowledge about co-ethnics and their practices, to position themselves in opposition to the ‘others’ within diaspora, and to justify their, typically negative, views towards other migrants. Sources of that knowledge can be experiential, though in most cases consist of hearsay evidence. This notion may assist intercultural communication scholars in understanding how intra-group relations are conceived and the consequences for migrants of the discourses they themselves spread within the wider group. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Banal interculturalism; discriminatory discourse; Latin Americans in London; othering; positioning",,,,,,,,,,"Aranda, E.M., Hughes, S., Sabogal, E., (2014) Making a life in multiethnic Miami: Immigration and the rise of a global city, , Boulder, CO: Lynne Rienner; Atkinson, R., (1998) The life story interview, , London: Sage; Bailey, B., Communicative behavior and conflict between African-American customers and Korean immigrant retailers in Los Angeles (2000) Discourse & Society, 11 (1), pp. 86-108; Billig, M., (1995) Banal nationalism, , London: Sage; Block, D., (2007) Second language identities, , London: Continuum; Bolden, G., Beyond answering.

The stories were recorded in villages in Java, Indonesia, and the women talk about their experience of remigration. Because of years of separation, family members are ‘family’ only in name, and the familiar concept of ‘home’ has become a strange place. The homecoming therefore involves attempts to redefine ‘self’ and ‘home’, and to reconnect emotionally with estranged family members. The article also considers returnee narratives as a critique of current identity research, which assumes that everybody ‘has’ or ‘owns’ an identity, but fails to recognise that for many people in developing countries, identity is an enforced position for which there is no alternative. It has to be occupied and it is not attributed with any prestige and therefore, cannot be used a resource for enhancing privilege. Finally, the article argues that migrant workers’ experiences should be included in our thinking about globalisation and intercultural communication. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","discourse analysis; disenfranchised groups; Domestic migrant workers; globalisation; identity struggles; returnee narratives",,,,,,"University Research Committee, University of Hong Kong, URC, HKU: PolyU 2444/13H","The research in this article was supported by the University Grants Committee of Hong Kong [grant number PolyU 2444/13H].",,,"Agustin, L.M., Forget victimization: Granting agency to migrants (2003) Development, 46 (3), pp. 30-36; Asis, M.M., Huang, S., Yeoh, B.S.A., When the light of the home is abroad: Unskilled female migration and the Filipino family (2004) Singapore Journal of Tropical Geography, 25 (2), pp. 198-215; Augoustinos, M., Walker, I., Donaghue, N., (2014) Social cognition.

However the focus on ‘the language problem’ has meant little attention is paid to diversity within and between migrant populations; and how interpreted consultations are influenced by intersecting migratory, ethnicity and sociodemographic variables. Our analysis of the experiences of patients, health care providers and interpreters in Scotland evidences the need to move beyond language, addressing multiple hidden inequalities in health care access and provision that operate in both clinic and, especially, home-based settings.

For this purpose, a translation session was implemented to a group of beginner-level learners of Japanese at a UK university. Analysis of classroom interaction and students’ journals revealed that the translation activities enabled the students to analyse, discuss, and reflect upon how choice of words (including choice of script, etc.) can play an important role in constructing perceptions and how it influences the relations between writers/texts and their readers. Furthermore, they allowed the students to explore the symbolic meanings of language by themselves, through the very process of translating a given text. In this study, culture was taught through the analysis, discussion, and creation of specific texts, rather than through the transmission of prescriptive knowledge regarding culture A or culture B. The results suggest that translation activities have the potential to contribute effectively to the implementation of a discourse approach to culture, even in the beginner-level classroom. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","beginner-level; Culture; discourse approach; Japanese; translation activities",,,,,,"Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, JSPS: 17K13486

Employing micro-analytic techniques, the study analyses meetings of two work teams in an international corporation. Findings reveal that although the team leaders are of the same national culture (Swedish), leadership is practiced in a very different manner and can be enacted in ways not adhering to their cultural norms. Moreover, leadership is collaboratively constructed by all participants. This paper highlights the importance of studying authentic leadership discourse and going beyond cultural stereotypes for future research into leadership practices. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","communities of practice; discourse analysis; intercultural communication; Leadership; national cultural stereotypes; Swedish",,,,,,,"This article is based on two research projects: The Research Writing Fund (CLASS CRG No. 9618006) and Strategic Research Grant (SRG No. 7008167) funded by the College of Liberal Arts and Social Sciences and City University of Hong Kong.",,,"Angouri, J., ‘If we know about culture it will be easier to work with one another’: Developing skills for handling corporate meetings with multinational participation (2010) Language and Intercultural Communication, 10 (3), pp. 206-224; Angouri, J., Marra, M., Corporate meetings as genre: A study of the role of the chair in corporate meeting talk (2010) Text & Talk, 30 (6), pp. 615-636; Asmuss, B., Svennevig, J., Meeting talk: An introduction (2009) Journal of Business Communication, 46 (1), pp. 3-22; Auer-Rizzi, W., Berry, M., Business vs. cultural frames of reference in group decision making: Interactions among Austrian, Finnish, and Swedish business students (2000) Journal of Business Communication, 37 (3), pp. 264-288; Boden, D., (1994) The business of talk: Organizations in action, , Cambridge: Polity Press; Bolden, R., Hawkins, B., Gosling, J., Taylor, S., (2011) Exploring leadership: Individual, organizational, and societal perspectives, , Oxford: Oxford University Press; Chan, A., Same context, different strategies: A company director’s discourse in business meetings (2007) Journal of Asian Pacific Communication, 17 (1), pp. 61-81; Chan, A., Meeting openings and closings in a Hong Kong company (2008) It’s the dragon’s turn–Chinese institutional discourse(s), pp. 181-229. , Sun H., Kádár D.Z., (eds), Bern: Peter Lang,.

This interpretive study uses qualitative methods to understand how NESs stimulate intercultural exchanges and awareness between Colombians and English-speaking foreigners; it looks specifically at private and public universities (formal spaces), and cafe-bars where language exchanges occur weekly (informal spaces) throughout Bogotá, Colombia. It finds that, essentialized ideas of both Anglophone and Latino cultures, dominant in such spaces, result in the promotion of stereotypes, exotification, and the privileging of NESs from specific countries and phenotypes over others by both NESs and Colombian language learners (CLLs). This study relates linguicism, or linguistic discrimination, as a factor that inhibits the potential for cultural awareness promoted through the use of NESs. The construction of an idealized, white NES delegitimizes non-Western Anglophone contexts, and upholds hegemonic standards of American and British English and cultures taught within English learning spaces. This places non-native English speakers and teachers in subaltern positions. Still, based on participant observations and interviews, it is evident that with intercultural training, NESs can assist in debunking preconceived, normative ideas about the English-speaking world. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","interculturality; Linguistic imperialism; native English speaker; native speakerisms",,,,,,,,,,"Acar, A., Kobayashi, H., Whys and how’s of language exchange meetings (2011) CALL-EJ, 12 (2), pp. 1-10; Alptekin, C., Towards intercultural communicative competence in ELT (2002) ELT Journal, 56 (1), pp. 57-64; Arikan, A., Chapter nine: Critical media literacy and ESL/EFL classrooms (2002) Counterpoints, 176, pp. 113-124; Bennett, M.J., (2007) Creating an interculturally competent campus to educate global citizens, p. 22. , Tallahassee: Florida State University, p; Bhabha, H., The other question: Stereotype, discrimination and the discourse of colonialism (1994) The location of culture, pp. 94-120. , London: Routledge; Byram, M., (1997) Teaching and assessing intercultural communicative competence, , Clevedon: Multilingual Matters; Byram, M., (2008) From foreign language education to education for intercultural citizenship, , Clevedon: Multilingual Matters; Cook, V., Going beyond the native speaker in language teaching (1999) TESOL Quarterly, 33 (2), pp. 185-209; Creswell, J., (2009) Research design: Qualitative, quantitative, and mixed methods approaches, , 3rd ed., Los Angeles, CA: Sage; Dietz, G., Mateos, L., (2011) Interculturalidad y educación intercultural en méxico, , México: SEP-CGEIB; Fandiño, Y.J., Teaching culture in Colombia Bilingüe: From theory to practice (2014) Colombian Applied Linguistics Journal, 16 (1), pp. 81-92; Foster, W., The exotic as a symbolic system (1982) Dialectical Anthropology, 7 (1), pp. 21-30; González-Moncada, A., Professional development of EFL teachers in Colombia: Between colonial and local practices (2007) Íkala, 12 (1), pp. 309-332; Gorski, P., Good intentions are not enough: A decolonizing intercultural education (2008) Intercultural Education, 19 (6), pp. 515-525; Guilherme, M., (2002) Cultural citizens for an intercultural world, , Clevedon: Multilingual Matters; Holliday, A., (2005) The struggle to teach English as an international language, , New York, NY: Oxford University Press; Huggan, G., (2001) The postcolonial exotic: Marketing the margins, , London: Routledge; Kachru, B., World Englishes: Approaches, issues and resources (1992) Language Teaching, 25 (1), pp. 1-14; Kramsch, C., The cultural component of language teaching (1995) Language, Culture and Curriculum, 8 (2), pp. 83-92; Kubota, R., Lin, A., Race and TESOL: Introduction to concepts and theories (2006) TESOL Quarterly, 40 (3), pp. 471-493; Kumaravadivelu, B., The decolonial option in English teaching: Can the subaltern act?

The study interrogates what the trainers’ discourses, ideologies and practices about the nature of their work are, and how these reside within the logic and discursive practices of their employer. A close analysis of interview, ethnographic and institutional data reveal that trainers get caught up between privileged and precarious working conditions. The findings emphasise that trainers identify shifting demands in language training that require them to act reflexively, empathetically and be able to connect the linguistic with the cultural and interpersonal. The results also suggest that the institutional discourse of the education company attempts an inclusive and emancipated diversity agenda but reproduces homogenous views of language, culture and the trainers’ work. This paper contributes to growing critical scholarship on the intersection of language, education and work in the globalised knowledge economy. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Discourse; ethnography; ideology; intercultural communication; language work; linguistic diversity",,,,,,,"This work was supported by Vienna University of Economics and Business through the WU small-scale project fund for junior faculty.",,,"Allan, K., Skilling the self: The communicability of immigrants as flexible labour (2013) Language, migration and social inequalities: A critical perspective on institutions and work, pp. 56-78. , Duchêne A., Moyer M., Roberts C., (eds), Bristol: Multilingual Matters,.

Cultural and pedagogical belief differences in EFL teachers can fuel a lack of professional understanding among teachers with contrasting perspectives about effective teaching practices. The present study examined the alignment between the beliefs of Chinese English teachers (CETs, n = 94) and American English teachers (AETs, n = 30) related to classroom practices in the English language classroom. Data sources included a questionnaire and one-on-one individual interviews with AETs and CETs. Results found many similarities in beliefs held by both groups. Notable differences were a preference for grammatical approaches and support for grammar translation method in teaching grammar and writing (CETs), and communicative approaches (AETs). Capacity for student-centeredness in large classes, more than about 25 students, was also an area of divergence among CETs and AETs. Future contexts of English use, either global or local, and the need to perform on EFL tests were both factors in shaping teacher beliefs about pedagogy for their students. With Chinese English learners increasing in number both in China and abroad, this study makes an important contribution to the cross-cultural understanding of practices and beliefs held by English teachers of Chinese learners. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","American; Chinese; EFL; IEP; teacher beliefs",,,,,,,,,,"(2017) World readiness standards for learning languages, , http://www.actfl.org/publications/all/national-standards-foreign-language-education, Retrieved from; Bachman, L.F., Palmer, A.S., (1996) Language testing in practice: Designing and developing useful language tests, , Oxford: Oxford University Press; Brown, C.A., Cooney, T.J., Research on teacher education: A philosophical orientation (1982) Journal of Research and Development in Education, 15 (4), pp. 13-18; Brutt-Griffler, J., Conceptual questions in English as a world language: Taking up an issue (1998) World Englishes, 17 (3), pp. 381-394; Brutt-Griffler, J., (2002) World English: A study of its development, , Clevedon: Multilingual Matters; Cao, Y., Willingness to communicate and communication quality in ESL classrooms (2012) TESL Reporter, 44 (1), pp. 17-36; Chen, M.-L., Squires, D., Influence of cooperative learning beliefs on classroom practices in Chinese English as a foreign language teachers (2007) The International Journal of Learning, 14 (4), pp. 101-110; Chen, Z., Goh, C., Teaching oral English in higher education: Challenges to EFL teachers (2011) Teaching in Higher Education, 16 (3), pp. 333-345; Chen, Z., Goh, C., Teacher knowledge about oral English instruction and teacher profiles: An EFL perspective (2014) Teacher Development, 18 (1), pp. 81-99; Davison, C., The contradictory culture of teacher-based assessment: ESL teacher assessment practices in Australian and Hong Kong secondary schools (2004) Language Testing, 21 (3), pp. 305-334; Dornyei, Z., (2005) The psychology of the language learner: Individual differences in second language acquisition, , London: Erlbaum; Fu, L., Wang, X., Wang, Y., The research on willingness to communicate in Chinese students’ EFL study (2012) Journal of Language Teaching and Research, 3, 1, pp. 112-117; Gan, Z., Understanding English speaking difficulties: An investigation of two Chinese populations (2013) Journal of Multilingual and Multicultural Development, 34 (3), pp. 231-248; Gu, Q., Variations in beliefs and practices: Teaching English in cross-cultural contexts (2010) Language and Intercultural Communication, 10 (1), pp. 32-53; Kachru, B., The power and politics of world English (1986) World Englishes, 5 (2-3), pp. 121-140; Kagan, D., Implications of research on teacher belief (1992) Educational Psychologist, 27 (1), pp. 65-90; Lee, J., Perceptions of ELT among English language teachers in China (2009) Chinese University Education Journal, 37 (1-2), pp. 137-154; Li, M., Baldauf, R., Beyond the curriculum: A Chinese example of issues constraining effective English language teaching (2011) TESOL Quarterly, 45 (4), pp. 793-803; MacIntyre, P., Dornyei, Z., Clement, R., Noels, K., Conceptualizing willingness to communicate in a L2: A situational model of L2 confidence and affiliation (1998) The Modern Language Journal, 82 (4), pp. 545-562; Martinez Agudo, J., (2016) Native and non-native teachers in second language classrooms: Professional challenges and teacher education, , Boston, MA: DeGruyter; Pajares, M.F., Teachers’ beliefs and educational research: Cleaning up a messy construct (1992) Review of Educational Research, 62, pp. 307-332; Pan, L., Block, D., English as a ‘global language’ in China: An investigation into learners’ and teachers’ language beliefs (2011) System, 39, pp. 391-402; Pettit, S.K., Teachers’ beliefs about English language learners in the mainstream classroom: A review of the literature (2011) International Multilingual Research Journal, 5 (2), pp. 123-127; Phillipson, R., (1992) Linguistic imperialism, , Oxford: Oxford University Press; Prabhu, N.S., The dynamics of the language lesson (1992) TESOL Quarterly, 26, pp. 225-241; Richards, J., Lockhart, C., (2000) Reflective teaching in second language classrooms, , Chinese edition.

This study highlights the underlying disorder within one pool (‘The Edge’) at the University of Leeds and identifies how swimmers are managed through the use of swimming categories and via a continuous reorganisation of space to suit the swimmers’ apparent needs. On the surface, this system creates an appearance of order, but a deeper investigation reveals the tension between swimmers, issues of power and accessibility, conflicting swimming approaches and culturally specific communication which does not easily translate from one group of swimmers to another. The study has also found that the pool is uncomfortably positioned between a consumerist model of customer satisfaction and a ‘commons’ model. Finally, an extended ethnographic study of this micro-setting has demonstrated its multivalent qualities where norms, expectations and resistance to hegemonic practices are located in an environment which has resonance with the concept of third space. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","interculturality; shared space; Swimming; third space",,,,,,,,,,"(2017) BBC News, , http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-gloucestershire-40887393, August 10, ‘Equality complaint sinks women-only swimming class.’ online.

Yet in contexts where virtually all intercultural communication is mediated by English as a foreign language (hereafter EFL), proficiency in that language determines to a large extent access to intercultural experiences, including coveted opportunities for international work and study. Such high stakes mean that acquiring competence in the language can be an emotionally charged process, and using it an emotionally salient feature of intercultural encounters. This paper draws upon an interview-based study of South Koreans’ ideologies of the intercultural to explore the complex emotions associated with using EFL in intercultural experiences. La ‘svolta interculturale’ nell'insegnamento delle lingue straniere ha messo in evidenza la necessità di promuovere le competenze interculturalie, nel processo, ha minimizzato il processo emotivo di acquisizione delle competenze in una lingua straniera. Tuttavia, in contesti in cui praticamente tutte le comunicazioni interculturali sono mediate dall'inglese, la capacità di parlare la lingua determina l'accesso a opportunità prestigiose per il lavoro e lo studio in contesti internazionali. Questo articolo è basato su una serie di interviste con dei soggetti sudcoreani dove si esplora come loro utilizzano delle complesse emozioni e ideologie interculturali associate all'uso dell'inglese come lingua straniera, per costruire l'esperienza interculturale. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","emotion; English as a foreign language; Intercultural competence; neoliberalism; values",,,,,,,,,,"Abelmann, N., Park, S.J., Kim, H., College rank and neo-liberal subjectivity in South Korea: The burden of self-development (2009) Inter-Asia Cultural Studies, 10 (2), pp. 229-247; Baider, F.H., Cislaru, G., (2014) Linguistic approaches to emotions in context, , Amsterdam: John Benjamins Publishing Company; Bauman, Z., From pilgrim to tourist–or a short history of identity (1996) Questions of cultural identity, , Hall S., du Gay P., (eds), Sage,.

Through seven students’ reflective essays on group-based intercultural learning, we analyse the ever-shifting communicative space that interlocutors produce through negotiating the meanings of difference and power and their dialogic relations with the other. Based on the findings, we propose intercultural dialogue (and intercultural communication) as a political and ethical response to the thirdness in the in-between space of communication, inherent in the character of social life but not always possible nor desired. We therefore suggest ‘principles’ for such dialogue be seen in this space and not as a teleologically-achievable ideal that privileges self-expression and normalises difference through a ‘cultural diversity’ discourse. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Dialogue; hybridity; in-betweenness; intercultural communication; thirdness",,,,,,,,,,"Anderson, R., Baxter, L.A., Cissna, K.N., Texts and contexts of dialogue (2004) Dialogue: Theorising difference in communication studies, pp. 1-17. , Anderson R., Baxter L.A., Cissna K.N., (eds), Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage, &,.

This paper reports on a project that explored experiences and perceptions of the development of intercultural competence in a UK higher education context. Academic staff (N = 8) and international postgraduate students (N = 24), from a range of countries, were recruited for preliminary interviews (two staff from each of the four faculties), focus groups (students of these staff), and stimulated recall interviews (same staff). The project targeted tensions and issues occurring between the perspectives of participants. It focused on the performance and negotiation of identities in the ‘third space’ that emerged between participants using different cultural discourses. The findings suggest that, despite the inherent contradiction of comfort and the conflict of negotiation, efforts are made by both students and staff to create a ‘comfortable’ third space in which to negotiate learning. By this we mean an environment in which to negotiate learning where those present feel at ease with their own and others’ cultural identities and differences. This raises significant implications for policies and practices regarding the development of intercultural competence. Specifically, the university needs to build a better understanding of how to create a ‘sphere of interculturality’ in which international postgraduate learning can take place. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","intercultural competence; internationalised higher education; postgraduate education; sphere of interculturality; Third space",,,,,,,,,,"Appadurai, A., (2013) The future as cultural fact: Essays on the global condition, , Brooklyn, NY: Verso Books; Bhabha, H., (1994) The location of culture, , New York, NY: Routledge; Byram, M., Conceptualizing intercultural (communicative) competence and intercultural citizenship (2014) The routledge handbook of language and intercultural communication, pp. 85-97. , Jackson J., (ed), London: Routledge,.

Although burgeoning research has illuminated how language learners are able to expand their identities and communicative repertoire through various digital media, relatively little attention has been paid to how video-sharing websites provide learners with discursive spaces that might differ from text-based online communities. Drawing on [Gee’s, J. P. (2000–2001). Identity as an analytic lens for research in education. Review of Research in Education, 25, 99–125] identity framework, our qualitative content analysis [Hsieh, H.-F., & Shannon, S. E. (2005). Three approaches to qualitative content analysis. Qualitative Health Research, 15, 1277–1288] examines 116 videos from three popular YouTube channels hosted by Chinese as an additional language (CAL) learners expatriating in Taiwan. The findings indicate that by utilizing mixed semiotic tools and interactional opportunities afforded by YouTube, the video hosts are able to showcase their transnational experiences and construct alternative discourse identities vis-à-vis traditionally less powerful identities such as subjugated foreigners and CAL learners. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Identities; second/additional language learners; translanguaging; transnational habitus; YouTube",,,,,,,,,,"Appadurai, A., Disjuncture and difference in the global cultural economy (1990) Public Culture, 2, pp. 1-24; Black, R., Online fan fiction, global identities, and imagination (2009) Research in the Teaching of English, 43, pp. 397-425; Brown, B.A., Reveles, J.M., Kelly, G.J., Scientific literacy and discursive identity: A theoretical framework for understanding science learning (2005) Science Education, 89 (5), pp. 779-802; Chen, S.C., Multilingualism in Taiwan (2010) International Journal of the Sociology of Language, 205, pp. 79-104; Cho, J.P., Global fatigue: Transnational markets, linguistic capital, and Korean-American male English teachers in South Korea (2012) Journal of Sociolinguistics, 16, pp. 218-237; Choi, J., Asian English language learners’ identity construction in an after school literacy site (2009) Journal of Asian Pacific Communication, 19, pp. 130-161; Chun, E.W., Ironic blackness as masculine cool: Asian American language and authenticity on YouTube (2013) Applied Linguistics, 34 (5), pp. 592-612; Darvin, R., Norton, B., Identity and a model of investment in applied linguistics (2015) Annual Review of Applied Linguistics, 35, pp. 36-56; De Costa, P.I., Tigchelaar, M., Cui, Y., Reflexivity and transnational habitus (2016) AILA Review, 29 (1), pp. 173-198; De Fina, A., Linguistic practices and transnational identities (2016) The Routledge handbook of language and identity, pp. 163-178. , Preece S., (ed), New York, NY: Routledge,.

The paper explores the potentials of this perspective based on ethnographic data collected through participant observation with reading groups located across Britain. The discussion demonstrates the public sphere in operation beyond the confines of the book club meeting, where literature in translation provides fragments of cultural difference and where the aesthetic-affective mode facilitates open dialogue, contributing to critical-reflexive understanding. The article illustrates the interplay of the normative and the actual aspects of the public sphere through the tension between cosmopolitanism in contemporary cultural consumption and the entertainment value of essentialist representations. The contribution points to the nexus between translation and intercultural communication. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Book clubs; cosmopolitanism; fiction in translation; reading groups; reading translated literature; the public sphere",,,,,,,,,,"Adiga, A., (2008) The White Tiger, , London: Atlantic; Adut, A., A theory of the public sphere (2012) Sociological Theory, 30 (4), pp. 238-262; Al Aswany, A., (2007) Yacoubian Building, , H.

The 24 participants, who received English-medium CLIL for nine years in the 1990s, were interviewed and the data analyzed using thematic analysis. The participants generally felt that CLIL had had a very positive effect on their target language attitudes. However, many considered that CLIL had affected negatively on their attitudes towards other foreign languages. The perceptions regarding the effect of CLIL on intercultural attitudes diverged more. The study elucidates the long-standing impact CLIL can have on individuals’ attitudes yielding insights into future CLIL education. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","CLIL; education; Finland; foreign language attitudes; intercultural attitudes",,,,,,,,,,"Aronin, L., Singleton, D., Multilingualism as a new linguistic dispensation (2008) International Journal of Multilingualism, 5, pp. 1-16; Bohner, G., Dickel, N., Attitudes and attitude change (2011) Annual Review of Psychology, 62, pp. 391-417; Braun, V., Clarke, V., Using thematic analysis in psychology (2006) Qualitative Research in Psychology, 3, pp. 77-101; Bruton, A., CLIL: Some of the reasons why … and why not (2013) System, 41, pp. 587-597; Byram, M., Gribkova, B., Starkey, H., (2002) Developing the intercultural dimension in language teaching.

Our main goal is to identify the major factors which influence over the school’s language education. As a national school abroad, this school should include national, local and global viewpoints in its education. Language education is one of the methods to respond to this expectation. The results of data analysis, collected through semi-structured interviews with the vice-principal and principal of the school as well as parents, suggest that home country ideologies have an important influence over the school’s and sojourner families’ views on language and language education. Our study has demonstrated that an ideology-loaded, top-down LEP is not appropriate for the current situation. Therefore, it proposes a need to update and revise the language education of Japanese schools abroad. This may ultimately lead to suggesting an involvement of the agents (principals, teachers and parents) and participants (students) who are absent from the design of the LEP. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Catalonia; education for intercultural understanding; ideology; Japanese school; language education policy; Language policy",,,,,,"HUM2005-08151/FILO

It will consider whether these films provide only negative representations of Native Americans and whether the linguistic and paralinguistic elements present in the films undermine those narratives. It will also compare the English originals and the Spanish dubbed movies in order to probe whether the narratives presented in the original films are maintained in the target versions. For this purpose, I will study the various textual layers present in the films, including the use of Injun English, the discourse of Anglo and Native Americans, the use of Spanish, and the translation of all these into Spanish. The study shows that the original films question old stereotypes of Native Americans, while the Spanish versions rely on more conventional narratives. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","multilingualism; narratives; Native Americans; stereotypes; Translation; westerns",,,,,,"Ministerio de EconomÃ­a y Competitividad, MINECO: FFI2015-66516-P","This work was supported by Ministerio de Economía y Competitividad [grant number FFI2015-66516-P].",,,"Averbach, M., Dances with Wolves: How to repeat old tricks and look new at the same time (2003) Screening culture.

Based on the results, the fansubbers’ strategies towards taboo language translation were classified into maintaining, deleting, mitigating, substituting, and amplifying. Further analysis suggested that their approach was guided by the source culture norms rather than the target culture norms as evidenced by their attempts to keep as many taboos as possible irrespective of the disapproval of the recipient dominant conventions. Such an exercise appears to be a subversion and resistance to the hegemonic doctrine and conservative ideology advocated in the Iranian society and mass media. © 2017, © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","audiovisual translation; Fansubbing; norms; Persian language; resistance; taboo language",,,,,,,,,,"Ameri, S., Ghazizadeh, K., A norm-based analysis of swearing rendition in professional dubbing and non-professional subtitling from English into Persian (2015) Iranian Journal of Research in English Language Teaching, 2 (2), pp. 78-96; Antonini, R., Bucaria, C., NPIT in the media: An overview of the field and main issues (2015) Non-professional interpreting and translation in the media, pp. 7-20. , Antonini R., Bucaria C., (eds), Wien, Austria: Peterlang, &,.

However, participants’ preparation experiences and future-oriented thought patterns prior to the international mobility period can influence the merits of such opportunities. This study, therefore, explored the preparation experiences of prospective English language teachers from Turkey who chose to study in England for a 4-month period. Utilizing an interpretative phenomenological analysis method, we revealed that participants’ lived and imagined experiences were shaped by three main themes: a groundless optimism, naiveté, and intercultural (in)competence. Based on these findings, we discussed the preparation processes for study abroad programs. © 2017, © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","imagined communities; intercultural competence; international exchange programs; interpretative phenomenological analysis; language teacher education; Study abroad",,,,,,,,,,"Altbach, P.G., Knight, J., The internationalization of higher education: Motivations and realities (2007) Journal of Studies in International Education, 11 (3-4), pp. 290-305; Amuzie, G.L., Winke, P., Changes in language learning beliefs as a result of study abroad (2009) System, 37 (3), pp. 366-379; Anderson, B., (1983) Imagined communities: Reflections on the origins and spread of nationalism, , London: Verso; Atay, D., Reflections on the cultural dimension of language teaching (2005) Language and Intercultural Communication, 5 (3-4), pp. 222-236; Baker, W., Intercultural awareness: Modelling an understanding of cultures in intercultural communication through English as a lingua franca (2011) Language and Intercultural Communication, 11 (3), pp. 197-214; Barkhuizen, G., Feryok, A., Pre-service teachers’ perceptions of a short-term international experience programme (2006) Asia-Pacific Journal of Teacher Education, 34 (1), pp. 115-134; Beaven, A., Borghetti, C., Interculturality in study abroad (2016) Language and Intercultural Communication, 16 (3), pp. 313-317; Bennett, M.J., Towards ethnorelativism: A developmental model of intercultural sensitivity (1993) Education for the intercultural experience, pp. 21-71. , Paige R.M., (ed), 2nd ed., Yarmouth, ME: Intercultural Press,.

It is argued that neoliberal keywords are rife in these documents, which represent a further move towards the instrumentalization of academic research. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","entrepreneurship; homo economicus; ideology; keywords; Neoliberalism",,,,,,,,,,"Androutsopoulos, J., Theorizing media, mediation and mediatization (2016) Sociolinguistics: Theoretical debates, pp. 282-302. , Coupland N., (ed), Cambridge: Cambridge University Press,.

Different strategies have been adopted to enforce this message: while New Labour was largely content to ignore the past, to treat it as irrelevant to the needs and possibilities of new times, prominent figures within more recent Conservative-led administrations have re-written the history of schooling, traducing the progressive traditions that their project is designed to eradicate. We attempt to sketch out a different version of this history, one that speaks back to such reductive misrepresentations (the ‘discourses of derision’, as Stephen Ball has called them). We focus particularly on developments within the teaching of English in London schools, on the challenges that confronted teachers in successive periods of rapid social change, how they responded to these conditions and the resources that enabled them to explore different curricular and pedagogic possibilities. We argue that this history provides the means to confront contradictions in the neoliberal project, to explore continuities in practice that are effaced and ignored in the dominant paradigm of objective-led teaching, a paradigm that reduces what happens in classrooms to the attainment of pre-specified goals. We conclude with an instance of classroom dialogue that might suggest the continuing need for teachers to be attentive to diversity: to the complexities of culture and history, of language and identity. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","English; London secondary schools; progressive tradition; reclaiming history",,,,,,,,,,"Alexander, R., Still no pedagogy?

Leverhulme Trust","My next job provided me with first-hand experience of another variant on the intersection of politics and education. I worked in a university department of Arts Education, where I specialised in research and teaching about the English Language, on the components of undergraduate degrees that led to a teaching qualification. My experience of this period felt somewhat like being pursued by the architects of the reconfigurations of the (state) school system that I thought I had left behind. Funding for these courses – for in those days, students still received public funding for their studies – was transferred to the Teacher Training Agency (TTA), a body established under the Education Act of 1994 with the aim of establishing a market in teacher training and imposing centralised curricula, always represented (or perhaps ‘spun’) as ‘driving up standards’ (Ellis, 2006), ‘remov[ing] at one stroke the buffer between government funding and university autonomy’ (Pring, 1996, p. 13). So whereas in other departments on the same campus, students’ fees were the responsibility of the Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE), and academics continued to have a fair degree of independence in developing the courses taught, the students I worked with were on a degree programme funded through the TTA, and there were tight prescriptions on the content of their courses. These were stipulated in publications with alliterative titles such as Teaching: High status, high standards (Requirements for Courses of Initial Teacher Training) (Department for Education and Employment, 1998), as well as in subject specific documents such as the Initial Teacher Training Curriculum for Primary English (Department for Education and Employment, 1997). The latter was described by one critic at the time (Graham, 1997) as ‘a most unnecessary document’, and the strong feelings it evoked in academics like her are demonstrated in the list of ‘key words’ she provides for it: ‘redundant, repetitive, inapplicable, ill-written, narrow-minded, mean-spirited, atheoretical, partial, unbalanced, unworkable, research-innocent, unimaginative, restrictive and an unwarranted incursion on academic freedom’ (p. 249). This quotation highlights the focus on the (absence of) intellectual content in the document, on which the author, as a teacher and researcher in the sector, was most qualified to comment. Other critiques at the time drew attention to the wider implications, for research and academic freedom, of ‘the trend towards isolating education departments from the rest of higher education’ (Deem, 1996, p. 156), as well as acknowledging the even more far-reaching ambition of which these changes were part. Considering the question of why the Thatcher government was relaxing entry qualifications for teachers in the private sector while simultaneously imposing ever more stringent restrictions on university education departments, Barton, Pollard, and Whitty (1993, p. 330) suggest that the latter were necessary in order to ‘rid the system of the so-called liberal [i.e. progressive] educational establishment’. Again, ‘free’ market principles were somewhat uncomfortably allied with an authoritarian role for the state. So once again, in the psychobiographical domain, I was experiencing my own position as a university employee in ways that were very much shaped by changes to the social setting: specific configurations of ideas and policies that were explicitly articulated, while changes in the contextual resources that were influencing day-to-day practices were less immediately apparent.","Alison Sealey is Professor of Applied Linguistics at Lancaster University, UK.

This article takes as the object of its investigation the Research Excellence Framework (REF), the most recent iteration of the UK government sponsored assessment exercise. It adopts a transdisciplinary approach which draws on political economy, social theory and critical discourse analysis. The analysis exposes the ways in which the Research Excellence Framework constructs an illusion of intellectual excellence and innovation whose true purpose is the neutralization of the university as a centre of independent knowledge creation and learning, and hence as a potential locus of intellectual opposition to the neoliberal hegemony. The article concludes by calling on academics to refuse the narrow model of research valorized by the REF and to reclaim the idea of the university as a public good. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","critical discourse analysis; critical realism; Neoliberalism; Research Excellence Framework; semiosis; UK higher education",,,,,,,,,,"Althusser, L., (1971) Lenin and philosophy, , New York: Monthly Review Press; Becker, G., (1964) Human capital: A theoretical and empirical analysis, with special reference to education, , 3rd ed., Chicago: Chicago University Press; Bergfeld, M., ‘Do you believe in life after work?’ The university and college union strike in Britain (2018) Transfer: European Review of Labour and Research, 24 (2), pp. 233-236; Bernstein, B., (1990) The structuring of pedagogic discourse, , London: Routledge; Bhaskar, R., (1986) Scientific realism and human emancipation, , London: Verso; Bhaskar, R., (2008) A realist theory of science, , London: Verso; Bhaskar, R., (2016) Enlightened common sense: The philosophy of critical realism, , London: Verso; Block, D., Political economy in applied linguistics research (2017) Language Teaching, 50 (1), pp. 32-64; Block, D., (2018) Political economy and sociolinguistics: Neoliberalism, inequality and social class, , London: Bloomsbury; Block, D., Gray, J., Holborow, M., (2012) Neoliberalism and applied linguistics, , London: Routledge; Boltanski, L., Chiapello, E., (2006) The new spirit of capitalism, , London: Verso; Bourdieu, P., (1998) Le Monde diplomatique, , https://mondediplo.com/1998/12/08bourdieu, December,Utopia of endless exploitation: The essence of neoliberalism.

A large body of work has shed much light on the way in which during the neoliberal period, a discursive shift has taken place whereby language is increasingly seen in instrumental terms of profit rather than in ethno/national pride. Though such work engages with language as a commodity within discourse, the view that language and languages themselves are literally commodities remains problematic. It is argued in this article that in the case of private commercial language schools known as eikaiwa in Japan, what is produced and consequently on sale, is not language itself, but rather the lesson. What this article offers, is an example of how commodity fetishism plays out in relation to language education, and how the commodity comes to be divorced from its production and its producers, in the recontextualization of the lesson in advertising. In contrast to previous work on eikaiwa advertising which focusses on depictions of exotic and eroticised white native English-speaking Others, the analysis here finds that representations of teachers, is largely absent. The article argues that this erasure of labour (teachers), and the foregrounding of the student in advertising, illustrate a form of commodity fetishism particular to the neoliberal period, where the student as neoliberal homo-œconomicus–producer of her own desire - comes to the fore. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","commodification; English Language Teaching; fetishism; Neoliberalism",,,,,,,,,,"Aeon televsion advertisement.

These young people in their twenties and thirties belong to one of the best trained generations in Spanish history and yet were obliged to migrate in order to try to fulfil their professional aspirations and to learn English in the hope of finding work. In this paper I analyse the ideologies that guide the decisions of these youths and the consequences of investing in a neoliberal logic where the stakes to learn English are high for those without the material and symbolic resources to survive in the city of London. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","English; language ideologies; London; mobility; work",,,,,,"PR2011-0574, FFI2011-26964

On the basis of ethnographic and interview data, I show language ideologies and patterns of language choice in a multilingual Belizean village to be related to economic activity. In the case in question, fishing, international tourism, transnational trade and work migration are crucial in understanding complex patterns of language ideology and use. The main argument is that economic practice is central in the development of social relations and thus of language ideologies. On a theoretical level, this implies that the discursive construction of a language (as Spanish, English or German) is linked to economic conditions. Where economic and political power structures co-occur, the emergence of clearly defined cultural and thus linguistic categories seems to be more likely. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Multilingualism–language ideology–economy–language choice–superdiversity",,,,,,"Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG: 1353/2-1","This work was supported by DFG - Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft: [Grant Number 1353/2-1].",,,"Agha, A., The social life of cultural value (2003) Language and Communication, 23, pp. 231-273; (2016), Belize received 1.3 million tourists 2015; Auer, P., From codeswitching via language mixing to fused lects: Toward a dynamic typology of bilingual speech (1999) The International Journal of Bilingualism, 3, pp. 309-332; Balam, O., Overt language attitudes and linguistic identities among multilingual speakers in northern Belize (2013) Studies in Hispanic and Lusophone Linguistics, 6, pp. 247-277; Barry, T., (1995) Inside Belize, , Albuquerque, NM: Resource Center Press; Barth, F., Introduction: Ethnic groups and boundaries.

It draws on the discursive analysis of a small corpus of life story data produced by native English language teachers of different ages residing in Barcelona. Through their own personal and professional accounts and rationales, it seeks to comprehend how they construct their work experiences in the light of previous professional trajectories, prior expectations and future mobility plans, but also against the backdrop of a highly precarised job market. The article argues that the ‘backpacker’ language teacher is certainly a reality but also a contemporary cultural myth that works to disguise a complex humanscape of relocators of different ages and aspirations who face difficulties fitting in an industry that expects docile and inexperienced bodies and a local market where nativeness enables quick access to teaching jobs but only to unskilled and temporary ones. The younger informants narrate biographies in flux and a sense of life stagnation or development to which commercial ELT may be differently instrumental. This article challenges assumptions about the value of (native) English in the work field and how easily work experience and qualifications travel around for middle-class professionals. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","ELT industry; language work; lifestyle mobility; precarious employment",,,,,,"Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovación, MICINN: FFI2014-54179-C2-1-P, FFI2011-26964","This work was supported by Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovaci?n [grant number FFI2011-26964, FFI2014-54179-C2-1-P].",,,"Alarcón, A., Garcia, D., Garzón, L., Samper, S., Terrones, A., perfiles, trayectorias y pautas de inserción laboral de los inmigrantes europeos en cataluña (2006) Inmigración comunitaria: ¿Discriminación inversa?, pp. 115-131. , Solé C., (ed), [Profiles, trajectories and labour insertion patterns of European migrants Catalonia], Rubí: Anthropos, &,.

By analysing personal-life narratives and conversations recorded over a two-year ethnography in a bench in Catalonia, it shows that informants practice immobility to gatekeep subsistence resources. They present themselves as dispossessed of welfare rights and belie unregistered economic tasks. They establish non-legitimised translinguistic normativities for intercultural communication yet engage in linguistic regimes demanding ‘integration’ through the nation-state language. This reveals how undocumented migrants challenge but simultaneously perpetuate the neoliberal work/legality conditions and sociolinguistic orders to which they are subjected, which positions them as ‘illegal’, ‘de-skilled’ and ‘languageless’ non-citizens. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","immobility; informal economy; Migration; neoliberalism; peripheral multilingualism",,,,,,"University of Alabama at Birmingham, UAB

Based on a multi-sited ethnography, this article explores a transnational social movement called Emmaus where voluntary work, geographical mobility, and language learning intersect. I analyse the role of language in narratives of mobile volunteers, or those with this intention, in the Emmaus network. Volunteers need to learn and use linguae francae (English and Spanish) for voluntary work, which they justify with inter-cultural and solidarity tropes. In addition, they must also navigate nation-state immigration laws and linguistic differences that contrast with their construction of Emmaus as a ‘safe zone’ for transnational mobility and communication. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","language learning; mobility; Social movement; sociolinguistic ethnography; voluntary work",,,,,,"UniversitÃ© de Fribourg

The complex life and mobility trajectories and multilingual practices of the international inhabitants are important features in the service economy of this tourist community. Work opportunities are closely linked to the languages required for the services that were historically set up to meet the needs of wealthy European residents settled in Empuriabrava. Migrants and locals who do not fulfil the linguistic demands of the service sector have few work opportunities and they are forced either to move their residence to another place in order to find work or to stay and live in precarious socio-economic conditions having to resort to jobs in the underground economy and endure living conditions at the margin of society. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","linguistics hierarchies; Mobility; multilingualism; structuration; work",,,,,,"Ministerio de Economía y Competitividad, MINECO: BES-2012-060660","This research was supported by the Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad [grant number BES-2012-060660].

To address the issue, this study sought to investigate the nonnative teachers’ perceptions of idealized native-speaker linguistic and pragmatic norms in the EIL context. Participants included 125 nonnative English-speaking teachers from the Persian context, falling within the expanding circle. Questionnaires and interviews were used to explore the teachers’ perceptions of native-speaker norms. Findings showed that the nonnative teachers gave preference to native-speaker linguistic norms despite the emerging nonnative EIL norms. Although most of the teachers accepted the existence of a number of accents in English, they preferred the standard American or British accent for language education. As to EIL pragmatic norms, the teachers argued that some degree of flexibility is acceptable with regard to the use of L1 pragmatic norms in the EIL context. The EFL teachers in the present study maintained that the transfer of L1 pragmatic norms to the nativized English makes English a legitimate and culturally appropriate variety in communication between nonnative speakers. The findings contribute to the reappraisal of ELT practices and the premises underpinning teaching EIL. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","English as an international language (EIL); language pedagogy; Linguistic norms; native-speaker norms; pragmatic norms",,,,,,,,,,"Alsagoff, L., McKay, S.L., Hu, G., Renandya, W.A., (2012) Principles and practices for teaching English as an international language, , New York: Routledge; Aston, G., Notes on the interlanguage of comity (1993) Interlanguage pragmatics, pp. 224-250. , Kasper G., Blum-Kulka S., (eds), New York, NY: Oxford University Press,.

Data were gathered from 211 email messages sent by 40 Spanish and American university students and were tagged following Martin and White’s Appraisal model. Quantitative and qualitative analyses of the lexico-grammatical tokens revealed that the participants used mostly Affect tokens in their interaction. This suggests that the students preferred expressing their own feelings and emotions rather than judging their partners’ behaviour or evaluating phenomena as a strategy to construct a positive and appealing personal identity. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Appraisal theory; asynchronous communication; CMC interaction; intercultural exchanges; virtual collaboration",,,,,,"Ministerio de EconomÃ­a y Competitividad, MINECO: EDU2014 54673R

The interview events became conversational and took the form of small culture formation on the go in which each participant employed diverse narratives to project, make sense of and negotiate expression of cultural identity. The student shifted between personal narratives drawn from her particular cultural trajectories and splintered from grand narratives of nation and global positioning, between non-essentialist threads and essentialist blocks. The researchers learned from her and intervened to facilitate shifts to non-essentialist threads, drawing on narratives from their own personal cultural trajectories, but sometimes also falling into essentialist blocks splintered from grand narratives. The roles of ideology and competing essentialist and non-essentialist discourses of culture were implicit in these negotiations, as were the personal agency of the student as she responded to the constraining conflicts, structures and hierarchies encountered through the events she spoke about. Rather than providing a picture of intercultural assimilation and integration, interculturality is revealed as a hesitant and searching negotiation, sometimes of vulnerability, wrong-footedness and occasional assault on identity. In un’intervista con una studentessa laureata, sulla sua esperienza interculturale di studio all’estero, è possibile osservare il coinvolgimento dei due ricercatori, così come dell’intervistata, in una mutua esplorazione dell’identità culturale. L’evento dell’intervista assume un tratto conversazionale, promuovendo la formazione di una small culture in movimento nella quale ogni partecipante impiega differenti narrazioni per proiettare, dare senso e negoziare espressioni di identità culturale. La studentessa si muove tra narrazioni personali modellate sulla base delle sue specifiche traiettorie culturali e scheggiate dalle grandi narrazioni relative alla nazione e al posizionamento globale, tra fili non essenzialisti e blocchi essenzialisti. I ricercatori apprendono da lei e intervengono per facilitare gli spostamenti verso fili non-essenzialisti, utilizzando a loro volta narrazioni provenienti dalle loro personali traiettorie culturali, ma cadendo talvolta loro stessi in blocchi essenzialisti che hanno la loro origine nelle grandi narrazioni. I ruoli dell’ideologia e dei discorsi essenzialista e non essenzialista relativi alla cultura, in conflitto tra loro, sono impliciti in queste negoziazioni, così come l’agency personale della studentessa che risponde attraverso gli eventi che racconta a elementi vincolanti quali conflitti, strutture e gerarchie. Invece di presentare una fotografia di assimilazione e integrazione interculturale, il presente articolo propone un’idea di intercultura come negoziazione esitante e minuziosa, talvolta caratterizzata da vulnerabilità, passi falsi e occasionali assalti identitari. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","cultural identity; discourse; Intercultural communication; interviews; narratives; negotiation",,,,,,,,,,"Amadasi, S., Beyond belonging.

The study finds that although the term ‘intercultural’ is frequently used in multiple forms, it is often aligned with the dominant discourses of the neoliberal university system in order to become an accepted part of the institution. A counter position, which I label ‘interculturality from below’, is taken by some social actors within the university who challenge essentialist and neoliberal approaches to the intercultural. This study is relevant to arguments which emphasise the need for a paradigm shift in the applications of the intercultural and it raises the question of whether a paradigm shift is possible within a neoliberal university system. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","institutionalisation in higher education; Intercultural communication; internationalisation; marketisation of higher education; neoliberalism",,,,,,,,,,"Adams, S., Janover, M., Introduction: Theorising the intercultural (2009) Journal of Intercultural Studies, 30, pp. 227-231; Ball, S., (2013) The education debate, , 2nd ed., London: Polity Press; Barnett, R., (1994) The limits of competence: Knowledge, higher education and society, , Buckingham: Open University Press; Barnett, R., (2011) Being a university, , London: Routledge; Barnett, R., The coming of the ecological university (2011) Oxford Review of Education, 37, pp. 439-455; Beck, U., (2002) Individualization, , London: Sage; Berube, M., Nelson, C., (1995) Higher education under fire, , London: Routledge; Billig, M., (1995) Banal nationalism, , London: Sage; Breidenbach, J., Nyiri, P., (2009) Seeing culture everywhere: From genocide to consumer habits, , Seattle: University of Washington Press; Canagarajah, S., (2002) Critical academic writing and multilingual students, , Ann Arbor: University of Michigan Press; Codrea-Rado, A., (2014) The Guardian, , http://theguardian.com/education/2014/apr/10/students-taking-languages-record-low, April 10, UK students taking languages degrees at a record low.

While many studies have examined Asian international students’ intercultural interactions during class discussions in Western/English-speaking countries, little is known about how the diverse students interact in EMI classes in the newly internationalized universities in Asia. This study analyzed interviews with 82 graduate students in a Taiwanese university to examine their classroom participation and identity construction in EMI. Findings indicate that Taiwanese and international students diverge in their frequency, manner, and content of speech in whole class discussions. Students explained the contrast in terms of cultural and linguistic identities while they also reported a dynamic two-way adjustment in their classroom behaviors over time. Previous studies emphasized the need for context-oriented analysis of students’ intercultural classroom experiences and tended to focus on the classroom contexts. This study suggests that such contextualized analysis needs to also attend to the local linguistic contexts and power relations between languages and cultures as they are intertwined with the cultural and linguistic identity construction that influence classroom behaviors in the non-Western and non-native-English-speaking settings. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Class participation; English-medium instruction; identity construction; intercultural communication; internationalization of higher education; Taiwan",,,,,,"Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan, MOST: NSC 102-2410-H-009-019","This work was supported by Ministry of Science and Technology of Taiwan [grant number NSC 102-2410-H-009-019].",,,"Baker, W., English as an academic lingua franca and intercultural awareness: Student mobility in the transcultural university (2016) Language and Intercultural Communication, 16 (3), pp. 437-451; Ballard, B., Clanchy, J., (1991) Teaching students from overseas, , Melbourne: Longman; Beckett, G.H., Li, F., Content-based English education in China: Students’ experience and perspectives (2012) Journal of Contemporary Issues in Education, 7 (1), pp. 47-63; Bucholtz, M., Hall, K., Identity and interaction: A sociocultural linguistic approach (2005) Discourse Studies, 7 (4-5), pp. 585-614; Chalmers, D., Volet, S., Common misconceptions about students from South-East Asia studying in Australia (1997) Higher Education Research & Development, 16 (1), pp. 87-99; Chang, Y.-Y., English-medium instruction for subject courses in tertiary education: Reactions from Taiwanese undergraduate students (2010) Taiwan International ESP Journal, 2 (1), pp. 55-84; Chen, S.-C., Multilingualism in Taiwan (2010) International Journal of the Sociology of Language, 205, pp. 79-104; Choi, J., ‘Speaking English naturally’: The language ideologies of English as an official language at a Korean university (2016) Journal of Multilingual and Multicultural Development; Choi, J.Y., Reasons for silence: A case study of two Korean students at a US graduate school (2015) TESOL Journal, 6 (3), pp. 579-596; Chou, L.-H., Lin, Y.-J., The internationalization of higher education in Taiwan: An examination of international students’ experiences (2011) Educational Policy Forum, 14 (2), pp. 35-64; Cortazzi, M., Jin, L., Culture of learning: Language classrooms in China (1996) Society and the language classroom, pp. 169-206. , Coleman H., (ed), Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, &,.

This article examines variation in the stance adopted in translation between Western press reports (in English) and Reference News (Chinese in pinyin: Cancao Xiaoxi) and argues, on the basis of frame analysis of 27 pairs of news reports on the Sino-Japanese territorial dispute, that news translation of controversial issues is a process in which the stance framed in the original news report is reframed for the target culture. Through quantitative and qualitative analysis, this study identifies three prominent types of framing variations—appropriation variation, labeling variation, and ambiguity variation—and examines their respective roles in reframing the stance toward a pro-China and often anti-Japan direction in the translation by Reference News. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","frame analysis; News translation; reframing; stance; the Sino-Japanese dispute",,,,,,,,,,"Baker, M., (2006) Translation and conflict.

The article also discusses how interactions with their significant others and access to different symbolic worlds through different languages condition this redefinition. The results have been obtained through the completion and analysis of 22 in-depth semi-structured interviews. The main results show there is a tendency to construct a fluctuating identity regulated by the interactions that the youngsters maintain with their significant others. In their self-identification, the valuation appears about what it means to be included in or form a part of the host society, which can in time make their cultural identity of origin invisible. It is observed how the length of stay factor leads to a progressive loss of their culture of origin, made evident when they begin to stop making use of Romanian in a family context. Finally, the role played by progressive access to diverse symbolic worlds in a plurilingual context in the said redefinition is explored. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","cultural identity; interaction; multilingual contexts; Self; significant others; young migrants",,,,,,,,,,"Armour, W., Reconceptualising ‘identity slippage’: Additional language learning and (L2) identity development (2009) Journal of Multilingual and Multicultural Development, 30 (4), pp. 311-326; Bandura, A., (1999) Auto-Eficacia: Cómo afrontamos los cambios de la Sociedad actual, , Bilbao: Editorial Desclée de Brouwer, S.A; Bandura, A., On the functional properties of perceived self-efficacy revisited (2012) Journal of Management, 38 (1), pp. 9-44; Bandura, A., Locke, E.A., Negative self-efficacy and goal effects revisited (2003) Journal of Applied Psychology, 88 (1), pp. 87-99; Bardin, L., (1986) El análisis de contenido, , Madrid: Akal; Blumer, H., (1982) El interaccionismo simbólico: perspectiva y método, , Barcelona: HORA, S.A; Bradby, H., Translating culture and language: A research note on multilingual settings (2002) Sociology and Health & Illness, 24 (6), pp. 842-855; Bruner, J.S., (1990) Actos de significado.

A rather obvious question pertains not only to how members communicate, which languages are used, for which function and operation, but more specifically how to increase the satisfaction of such members in linguistically mixed teams. The aim of this article is to examine in what way people, with their varying degrees of intercultural empathy and understanding, meet with varying degrees of success in crossing language borders.

Their reflections sometimes evidence much-vaunted IC attributes such as ‘tolerance’ and ‘empathy’, but often indicate individually-developed, non-teleologically based IC criteria. Furthermore, reflection was often painful and at times led to a ‘falling back on’ essentialist notions of culture. We suggest that rather than reject essentialism as a ‘simplistic’ starting point, it should be recognised as existing symbiotically with non-essentialist notions and could be used critically throughout intercultural learning. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","essentialism; experiential learning; Intercultural competence; non-essentialism; reflection",,,,,,,,,,"Akbari, R., Reflections on reflection: A critical appraisal of reflective practices in L2 teacher education (2007) System, 35, pp. 192-207; Bakhtin, M.M., Holquist, M., (1981) The dialogic imagination: Four essays, , Austin: University of Texas Press; Bennett, M.J., Toward ethnorelativism: A developmental model of intercultural sensitivity (1986) Cross-cultural orientation: New conceptualizations and applications, pp. 21-70. , Paige R.M., (ed), New York, NY: University Press of America,.

The microanalysis of video data from the training sessions counteracts these discourses by showing how social orderliness, cooperation, and creativity unfold in the details of interaction. The significance of its contribution lies in its analysis of communication that bridges across semiotic modes, extending the concept of translanguaging to encompass embodied practice.

It is found that in the family mediation data, parties construct a case discursively through ascribing oppositional cultural categories to themselves and the other party, and that the mediator does not interrogate this narrative. In contrast, university mediators use the ascribed oppositional cultural categories as a starting point for encouraging parties’ deep reflection on themselves and the other, and thus act as cultural brokers. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","conflict resolution; cultural brokering; Cultural categories; cultural negotiation; mediation",,,,,,,,,,"Arminen, I., (2005) Institutional interaction: Studies of talk at work, , Aldershot: Ashgate; Brigg, M., Bleiker, R., (2011) Mediating across difference: Oceanic and Asian approaches to conflict resolution, , Honolulu: University of Hawaii Press, &, (Eds; Busch, D., How does culture affect conflict mediation?

These include diversifying teaching resources by using bilingual materials and dialogic tasks, as well as making adjustments to teaching by simplifying input and including cultural references. These practices are characterised by ‘a situated child-centred approach’ which is underpinned by 10 core principles of multilingual classroom pedagogy for English as an additional language.

The findings highlight that the extent to which a person feels integrated, for example, by feeling accepted in society and in specific contexts, affects their opportunities for social interaction and improving their English language skills.

The article first emphasizes the centrality of language in the process of meaning construction. As a result, in the following section, we point to a potential contribution that a cognitive-linguistic perspective with its focus on two complex systems, that is, language and cognition, can bring to research on IC. More specifically, since, as we argue, intercultural competence is an abstract notion incorporating other intangible concepts, its interpretation needs a languacognitive focus. To illustrate the validity of the approach, we analyze meaning construals of IC of the participants of the summer school DICETE. The results highlight the importance of language for interpreting and developing IC in the context of higher education. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","cognition; constructionism; higher education; intercultural competence; Language",,,,,,,,,,"Barsalou, L.W., Perceptual symbol systems (1999) Behavioral and Brain Sciences, 22, pp. 577-660; Barsalou, L.W., The human conceptual system (2012) The Cambridge handbook of psycholinguistics, pp. 239-258. , Spivey M., McRae K., Joanisse M., (eds), New York, NY: Cambridge University Press; Barsalou, L.W., Situated conceptualization: Theory and application (2016) Foundations of embodied cognition, pp. 1-17. , Coello Y., Fischer M.H., (eds), East Sussex: Psychology Press; Barsalou, L.W., Santos, A., Simmons, W.K., Wilson, C.D., Language and simulation in conceptual processing (2008) Symbols, embodiment, and meaning, pp. 245-283. , De M., Vega A., Glenberg M., Graesser A.C., (eds), Oxford: Oxford University Press; Barsalou, L.W., Wiemer Hastings, K., Situating abstract concepts (2005) Grounding cognition: The role of perception and action in memory, language, and thought, pp. 129-163. , Pecher D., Zwaan R., (eds), New York, NY: Cambridge University Press; Bennett, M.J., (2001), http://www.idrinstitute.org/allegati/IDRI_t_Pubblicazioni/88/FILE_Documento_Global_ICC_IDRI.pdf, Intercultural competence for global leadership.

Following on studies of globalized workplaces that have focused on lingua franca English, this article explores translingual practice as represented in interview and blog narratives recounted by multilingual, multiethnic young adults hired by Japanese schools and companies for their English proficiency. In these metapragmatic narratives of interactions with supervisors and coworkers, participants portray themselves surmounting communicative challenges through investment in L2 Japanese, and especially through pragmatic accommodation to local norms.

Massive exposure to the language, chances for interaction with native speakers, and cultural immersion appear to create excellent conditions for language learning. Yet, most available research indicates that study abroad (SA) participants rarely achieve linguistic success. By way of contrast, the aim of the study reported below is to investigate an example of accomplishment in language learning abroad. The participant of the study is a Polish third-year student of English studies who took part in a semester-long SA programme (Erasmus+) in Turkey. The instrument used in the study is her personal narrative, specifically her language learning history which was analysed with the use of a grounded theory approach. The results of the study provide insights into which and how motivations, personality traits, and SA contexts interact resulting in successful L3 learning. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Cross-cultural communication; intercultural awareness; intercultural narrative; language learning; mobilities; narrative accounts",,,,,,,,,,"Adams, R., Language learning strategies in study abroad context (2006) Language learners in study abroad contexts, pp. 259-292. , DuFon M.A., Churchill E., (eds), Clevedon: Multilingual Matters; Allen, H.W., Language-learning motivation during short-term study abroad: An activity theory perspective (2010) Foreign Language Annals, 43, pp. 27-49; Allen, H.W., Self-regulatory strategies of foreign language learners.

In interviews with newly arrived postgraduate students about their experience of travelling to study abroad, the students employ competing block and thread narratives. Block narratives represent an essentialist discourse of culture. As such, they are easily converted into cultural prejudice by blocking the possibility for understanding and sharing at the point of tolerating an Other who can never be like ‘us’. These are default narratives because of the way in which we are brought up in our societies within a global positioning and politics. Thread narratives instead support a critical cosmopolitan discourse of cultural travel and shared meanings across structural boundaries that act against cultural prejudice. Threads need to be nurtured as alternative forms of engagement. Therefore, there is a place for the researchers to intervene with their own thread narratives. This intervention is both allowed within and supported by an understanding that researchers join with their participants in the creative intercultural events of the interview. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","discourse; interaction; Intercultural communication; narratives; positioning",,,,,,,,,,"Amadasi, S., Beyond belonging.

It is based on an action research using a case study approach to examine the role of cultural background in the acquisition of EFL. Drawing from intercultural competence theories, it is argued that while cultural background plays an important role in students’ entry level and approach to learning EFL, in general, and reading competence, in particular, it does not play a determining role in their progress and achievements. Rather, students with high intercultural competence, regardless of cultural background, entered a dialogue and engaged with students of other cultures, which was associated with an ability to enter a dialogue and engage with a text in English. Students’ intercultural competence was developed by the creation of a ‘classroom culture’ where structured and unstructured activities guided by the teacher spurred engagement and negotiation processes between students of diverse cultural backgrounds for the purpose of enhancing intercultural competence and English reading comprehension skills. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","cultural identity; foreign language education; immigrants; Intercultural competence; intercultural exchange; multiculturalism",,,,,,,,,,"Allwright, D., Exploratory practice: Rethinking practitioner research in language teaching (2003) Language Teaching Research, 7, pp. 113-141; Bennett, J.M., Toward ethnorelativism: A developmental model of intercultural sensitivity (1993) Education for the intercultural experience, pp. 21-71. , Paige R.M., (ed), Yarmouth, ME: Intercultural Press; Bhawuk, D.P.S., Brislin, R., The measurement of intercultural sensitivity using the concepts of individualism and collectivism (1992) International Journal of Intercultural Relations, 16, pp. 413-436; Byram, M., (1997) Teaching and assessing intercultural communicative competence., , Philadelphia, PA: Multilingual Matters; Byram, M., Language awareness and (critical) cultural awareness–relationships, comparisons and contrasts (2012) Language Awareness, 21 (12), pp. 5-13; Byram, M., Kühlmann, T., Müller-Jacquier, B., Budin, G., (2004), http://www.incaproject.org/index.htm, Intercultural Competence Assessment Project (INCA).

Interviews with 26 students were conducted over a three-year period, most of whom were multilingual. Approximately half spoke English as an additional language. The remainder were native speakers of English. The paper shows how identities of learners of Mandarin are complex due to the varied experiences they brought into their studies. In light of the kinds of students found to be learning Mandarin, the paper advocates that approaches to teaching and learning Mandarin need to be more rooted in biographical, social and intercultural understandings of identity. To this end, the paper proposes interculturality in preference to the more traditional notion of intercultural competence as a conceptual frame for the learning of Mandarin. Perspectives based on interculturality question the limitations of traditional conceptualisations of otherness. Such perspectives attempt to locate interculturality within a more nuanced understanding of intercultural difference. The paper argues that in this way the teaching and learning of Chinese as a global language can more readily act as an effective means for learners to orient themselves to the Chinese society and ‘culture’, and to the wider world. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","biography; ecology; Identity; intercultural competence; interculturality; Mandarin Chinese",,,,,,,,,,"Barrett, M., Byram, M., Lázár, I., Mompoint-Gaillard, P., Philippou, S., (2014) Developing intercultural competence through education, , http://www.coe.int/t/dg4/education/pestalozzi/Source/Documentation/Pestalozzi3.pdf, J.

While one dyad expressed the greatest satisfaction and developed the autonomy to continue the project beyond the curricular requirement, the other dyad expressed the greatest frustration, requiring a pedagogical intervention. To examine how the two dyads’ different experiences could be attributed to turn negotiation patterns, the English portion of the second interaction session was analyzed. The results showed that for the unsuccessful dyad, silence, which was used by the Japanese EFL learner as a contextualization cue, triggered the American student’s hyperexplanation to get the Japanese partner involved in conversation. However, such a high-involvement strategy, only resulted in producing fewer opportunities for the Japanese partner to contribute to the conversation (i.e. vicious cycle). In contrast, successful turn negotiation of the other dyad enabled them to share knowledge schema, improve recipient design, and adjust their speech accordingly. Such personalized speech, in turn, led to the co-construction of conversation (i.e. virtuous cycle). Based on these observations, I conclude that ‘missed communication’ may entrench attribution of negative personal traits unless appropriate scaffolding/intervention is provided. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","conversational style; interactional sociolinguistics; listenership; silence; Telecollaboration; turn-taking",,,,,,"Georgetown University","This work was supported by the ITEL Teletandem Project at Georgetown University.",,,"Akiyama, Y., Saito, K., Development of comprehensibility and its linguistic correlates: A longitudinal study of video-mediated telecollaboration (2016) The Modern Language Journal, 100 (3), pp. 585-609; Bateson, G., (1972) Steps to an ecology of mind: Collected essays in anthropology, psychiatry, evolution, and epistemology, , Chicago, IL: University of Chicago Press; Belz, J.A., Linguistic perspective on the development of intercultural communicative competence in telecollaboration (2003) Language Learning & Technology, 7 (2), pp. 68-117; Bennett, A., Interruptions and the interpretation of conversation (1981) Discourse Processes, 4, pp. 171-188; Bitti, P.E.R., Garotti, P.L., Nonverbal communication and cultural differences: Issues for face-to-face communication over the internet (2011) Face-to-face communication over the internet, pp. 81-99. , Kappas A., Krämer N.C., (eds), Cambridge: Cambridge University Press; Byram, M., (1997) Teaching and assessing intercultural communicative competence, , Bristol, PA: Multilingual Matters; Chen, G.M., Starosta, W.J., The development and validation of the intercultural communication sensitivity scale (2000) Human Communication, 3, pp. 1-15; Cziko, G., Electronic tandem language learning (eTandem): A third approach to second language learning for the 21st century (2004) CALICO Journal, 22 (1), pp. 25-39; Dervin, F., Liddicoat, A.J., (2013) Linguistics for intercultural education (Vol. 33), , Amsterdam: John Benjamins; Dörnyei, Z., The L2 motivational self system (2009) Motivation, language identity and the L2 self, pp. 9-11. , Dörnyei Z., Ushioda E., (eds), Buffalo, NY: Multilingual Matters; Erickson, F., Listening and speaking (1986) Languages and linguistics: The interdependence of theory, data, and application, pp. 294-319. , Tannen D., Alatis J., (eds), Washington, DC: Georgetown University Press; Fiksdal, S., (1990) The right time and pace: A microanalysis of cross-cultural gatekeeping interviews, , Norwood, NJ: Ablex; Gordon, C., Gumperz and interactional sociolinguistics (2011) The Sage handbook of sociolinguistics, pp. 67-84. , Wodak R., Johnstone B., Kerswill P.E., (eds), London: Sage; Gumperz, J., (1982) Discourse strategies, , Cambridge: Cambridge University Press; Harumi, S., Classroom silence: Voices from Japanese EFL learners (2011) ELT Journal, 65 (3), pp. 260-269; Hayashi, M., (2003) Joint utterance construction in Japanese conversation, , Amsterdam: John Benjamins; House, J., Understanding misunderstanding: A pragmatic-discourse approach to analysing mismanaged rapport in talk across cultures (2000) Culturally speaking.

The rapport-management strategies were explored and then further evaluated in relation to the taxonomies of relational work within the discourse, illocutionary and stylistic domains. It found that Chinese and British students belong to distinct discourse communities shaped by different and similar discursive practices and norms, which are conditioned not only by different national cultures, but also by a similar community culture. The findings should be able to (1) develop the existing research alike and show how the email behaviour reflects the intricate and dynamic factors of rapport management; (2) support integrating the theories of rapport management and relational work into methodologically sound cross-cultural/intercultural pragmatic studies; (3) enable email writers to maintain or enhance harmonious relationships with recipients so as to obtain request compliance smoothly and to uphold their membership within the discourse community and (4) help readers to learn the pragmatic aspects of native and foreign languages in workplaces. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","discourse community; Rapport management; relational work; request emails",,,,,,"15NDJC241YB

To this end, it examines how a group of bilingual learners engaged with a translation task that was assigned to them as part of their study in an advanced-level Japanese language class at an Australian university. Analysis of the students’ translations and their translation processes showed that they were engaging in a complex process of intercultural communication that prompted them to reflect on the symbolic dimensions of the text: how the text is framed, how the author is positioned, and how prior discourses shape the production and reception of the text. The paper thus argues that translation may be an effective approach for developing advanced-level bilingual learners’ symbolic competence to mediate between interlocutors who belong to different ‘discourse worlds.’ © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","bilingual education; intercultural communication; intercultural learning; Japanese; symbolic competence; Translation",,,,,,,,,,"(2012), http://ausit.org/AUSIT/Documents/Code_Of_Ethics_Full.pdf, AUSIT code of ethics and code of conduct.

Drawing on ethnographic fieldwork in Beijing, I study new Chinese emigrants who have moved upward to the middle layers of the Chinese society, and now move out of the country by mobilizing their economic, educational, linguistic, and cultural resources. I present two cases to demonstrate the new emigrants’ use of languages in voice making processes. The results indicate that the new Chinese emigrants are highly mobile, both geographically and socially; they display diverse kinds of voicing possibilities and align with different cultures through nuanced use of languages and language varieties; further, they exercise increasingly more influences both on the receiving society and on the sending society. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Chinese new immigrants; ethnography; intercultural exchange; mobility; space; Voice",,,,,,,,,,"Agar, M., (1995) Language shock: understanding the culture of conversation, , New York, NY: William Morrow; Agha, A., Voice, footing, enregisterment (2005) Journal of Linguistic Anthropology, 15, pp. 38-59; Bakhtin, M., (1935) The dialogic imagination: Four essays, , M.

Using Byram’s model of intercultural communicative competence, this study examines the learner’s naturalistic communication in a social networking site (SNS). The qualitative analysis indicates that the learner acted upon the affordances of SNSs to reflect on her intercultural experiences and displayed evidence of intercultural understanding during her study abroad years. The learner’s intercultural knowledge, attitudes, and discovery are shown to be co-constructed by her and other members in the online discourse. This study indicates that computer-mediated communities like SNSs provide the learner with a space in which she documented her cultural experience and reflected on those experiences in real-time exchanges with multilingual, multicultural users.

However, especially in the bilingual territories in Spain, the literature stresses the importance of being Spanish-speakers or non-Spanish-speakers in the construction of these attitudes. Focusing on the case of Catalonia (Spain), this paper intends to analyse the impact of the family language and the generational cohort on the language attitudes towards Catalan and Spanish that is built by immigrant children (aged 14–16). The nature of the analysis carried out as a result of an attitude questionnaire answered by 527 young people allows differentiation of the effect of both variables individually when included in the same explanatory model. Results indicate that being Spanish-speaking or non-Spanish-speaking is influential in the construction of attitudes towards Spanish and towards Catalan. Moreover, the generational cohort is only influential for attitudes towards Catalan and when a migratory transit has been experienced or not. Since both variables are included in the same model, it is suggested that the effect of the generational cohort is moderated by being Spanish-speaking or not. The new perspectives opened up by these results are discussed as regards the promotion of intercultural communication and a common project of coexistence. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Catalonia (Spain); generational cohort; Language attitudes; Spanish-speaking–non-Spanish-speaking; young immigrants",,,,,,"AgÃ¨ncia de GestiÃ³ d'Ajuts Universitaris i de Recerca, AGAUR

Its parallel resource, the Autobiography of Intercultural Encounters through Visual Media (AIEVM), helps users explore the intercultural experiences they have encountered through images portrayed in television, films or the Internet. Both of them favour the analysis of the image of the other as either somebody the user has personally met or somebody featured in photographs, portraits or paintings. This paper looks into the intercultural reflection the AIE fosters through a case study of three autobiographies. The stories show the complexities behind the image of the other(s) and how they are seen by the users of the AIE. The findings indicate that the users have developed intercultural attitudes, skills and knowledge, and take action as an important part of their IC. The data show that the AIE facilitates reflection on key intercultural aspects and that it enhances self-awareness. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","action-taking; attitudes and feelings; Autobiography; intercultural competence; intercultural encounter; narrative",,,,,,,,,,"Alasuutari, H., Jokikokko, K., Intercultural learning as a precondition for more inclusive society and schools (2010) Finnish Journal of Ethnicity and Migration, 5 (3), pp. 27-37; Alkheshnam, A., (2012), Intercultural competence: Components and measurements.

The findings show that the women were marginalized and had limited meaningful contact and intercultural communication with Koreans in various interethnic contexts. They were stigmatized for their linguistic and cultural backgrounds; the nature of their marriage/migration; and their class, gender, and race. The three-generation households in which they lived were sites of oppression where they were pressured to strictly adhere to traditional Korean linguistic and cultural norms. In the workplace, they were positioned as incompetent second-language (L2) speakers on account of their regional dialects and lack of sociolinguistic competence. Additionally, they experienced racial discrimination in the larger community, based on their language and ethnicity. Despite various types of marginalization, the participants resisted their families’ impositions and stereotypes from mainstream society. They sought to gain legitimacy through enhancing their linguistic capital valued in professional settings. The study suggests that narratives can be a powerful means to reveal processes of marginalization and the impact of marginalization on L2 learning and identity. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","ethnic minorities; Identity; Korean; marginalization; migration; second-language learning",,,,,,"Ministry of Education, Science and Technology, MEST: AKS-2012-BAA-2101

This paper captures some of these contrasts as constructed through its multilingual landscape, focusing on shop names. Whereas many shop names are characterised by destandardisation, iconisation or translanguaging, there is also noticeable variation according to different spaces, in particular, casino complexes vs. local neighbourhoods. Shop names in Macao’s casino complexes tend to exoticise Western languages, particularly English, by adding symbols or ‘iconising’ the letters to take on a foreign, mysterious or a friendly appearance; those in local neighbourhoods, however, often highlight Chinese traditions, for instance, by invoking the right-to-left text vector which was more prevalent in Chinese communities until the mid-twentieth century. The former phenomenon is partly based on the symbolic function of Western languages and symbols in Macao (i.e. Western brands are associated with high-quality and fashionable products), creating an exoticisation effect. The latter respects Macao’s history and is an outcome of particular government regulations. These two types of naming strategies show how various shops and businesses take different positions on various sociolinguistic ‘scales’ in relation to their goods and customers. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","exoticisation; linguistic landscape; Macao (Macau); Modernity; shop names; tradition",,,,,,"Universidade de Macau, UM: MYRG2016-00099-FAH, MYRG2014-00026-FAH","This work was supported by University of Macau [grant numbers MYRG2014-00026-FAH and MYRG2016-00099-FAH].",,,"Blommaert, J., (2010) The sociolinguistics of globalisation, , Cambridge: Cambridge University Press; Douglass, W.A., Raento, P., The tradition of invention: Conceiving Las Vegas (2004) Annals of Tourism Research, 31 (1), pp. 7-23; (2011), http://www.dsec.gov.mo/getAttachment/7a3b17c2-22cc-4197-9bd5-ccc6eec388a2/E_CEN_PUB_2011_Y.aspx, Direcção dos Serviços de Estatística e Censos [Statistics and Census Service], Government of Macao SAR.

It provides a fascinating example of intercultural knowledge-work involving a complex set of conceptual migrations through time and space, across languages and cultures, and within domains and disciplines. We first review the vitality of the concept as used in Western disciplines (chiefly intercultural communication and psychotherapy), noting how the Eastern origins are mentioned but not fully discussed. We then review the ancient origins in Eastern religious and philosophical thinking concluding with an account of the development of the term in the East until recent times. As we discuss next, when these differing arenas of use and development interact, understandings become contested and issues of privilege vis-á-vis knowledge sources can be seen. These complexities raise questions about authenticity versus translation with regard to the differing uses made of the concept in the different arenas. Learning from the reviews of the differing understandings of this concept and the sometimes fraught interactions between them, we propose that scholars and practitioners working in our highly interconnected era, adopt an intercultural ethic to regulate and guide such knowledge-work. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","intercultural ethics; knowledge-work; Mindfulness",,,,,,"Arts and Humanities Research Council, AHRC: AH/J005037/1

Drawing on a social constructionist paradigm, it investigates students’ constructions of their emotion-management strategies, and the effects of social interactions on the emergence of these strategies. The findings suggest that emotion management in intercultural adjustment goes far beyond a linear cultural learning process, and that the value of affective intercultural adjustment includes, but is not limited to, preserving psychological well-being. Furthermore, emotion-management strategy construction is shaped or impinged upon by various interpersonal and structural considerations, conditions, or limits. The study contributes to the existing understanding of affective intercultural adjustment by shedding light on the uniqueness, fluctuations, dynamics, and multiple facets of the adjustment process, as well as its implications in both individual and social terms. The study highlights the importance of adopting a holistic and integrative perspective when conceptualizing affective intercultural adjustment. The findings also raise practical implications, by proposing the necessity to incorporate an emotion-management dimension into intercultural education, and to provide emotional support that is responsive to international students’ specific concerns. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Chinese international students; Emotion management; ethnography; intercultural adjustment; intercultural education; social constructionism",,,,,,,,,,"Anderson, L.E., A new look at an old construct: Cross-cultural adaptation (1994) International Journal of Intercultural Relations, 18, pp. 293-328; Braun, V., Clarke, V., Using thematic analysis in psychology (2006) Qualitative Research in Psychology, 3, pp. 77-101; Brewer, J.D., (2000) Ethnography, , Buckingham: Open University Press; Brown, L., The transformative power of the international sojourn: An ethnographic study of the international student experience (2009) Annals of Tourism Research, 36 (3), pp. 502-521; Burr, V., (2003) Social constructionism, , 2nd ed., London: Routledge; Chen, G.-M., The impact of harmony on Chinese conflict management (2002) Chinese conflict management and resolution, pp. 3-17. , Chen G.-M., Ma R., (eds), Westport, CT: Ablex; Chen, G.-M., Starosta, W.J., A review of the concept of intercultural sensitivity (1997) Human Communication, 1, pp. 1-16; Chen, G.-M., Starosta, W.J., The development and validation of the intercultural communication sensitivity scale (2000) Human Communication, 3, pp. 1-15; Chen, G.-M., Starosta, W.J., (2005) Foundations of intercultural communication, , Lanham, MD: University Press of America; Chen, S.-H., (2009), Intercultural team teaching: A study of local and foreign EFL teachers in Taiwan (Unpublished doctoral dissertation).

Studies of lifestyle migration, viewed as a deliberate and relatively privileged search for a new life abroad, commonly refer to the theme of integration as an obsession among migrants, with the British in particular at pains to distinguish themselves from those who do not integrate. While studies generally approach the concept from the researcher’s perspective, it is appropriate to make a detailed investigation of how migrants themselves understand it. In this study I show how data from interviews carried out with British people living in the Ariège département can be analysed using a narrative positioning framework to illustrate how migrants themselves appropriate the concept of integration as a strategy for positive self-identification. The study extends our understanding not only of self-positioning within intercultural contexts, but also how local narrative work within the social context of lifestyle migration is situated within a broader moral landscape. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","British expats; discursive strategies; identity; ideologies; integration; Lifestyle migration; narrative positioning",,,,,,,,,,"Bamberg, M., Positioning between structure and performance (1997) Journal of Narrative and Life History, 7 (1-4), pp. 335-342. , https://www.clarku.edu/~mbamberg/Material_files/Positioning_Between_Structure_and_Performance.pdf, Retrieved from; Bamberg, M., Georgakopoulou, A., Small stories as a new perspective in narrative and identity analysis (2008) Text & Talk, 28 (3), pp. 377-396; Benson, M., (2011) The British in rural France: Lifestyle migration and the ongoing quest for a better way of life, , Manchester: Manchester University Press; Benson, M., O’Reilly, K., Migration and the search for a better way of life: A critical exploration of lifestyle migration (2009) The Sociological Review, 57 (4), pp. 608-625; Benson, M., O’Reilly, K., From lifestyle migration to lifestyle in migration: Categories, concepts and ways of thinking (2015) Migration Studies, 3 (2), pp. 1-18; Benson, M., Osbaldiston, N., New horizons in lifestyle migration research: Theorising movement, settlement and the search for a better way of life (2014) Understanding lifestyle migration: Theoretical approaches to migration and the quest for a better way of life, pp. 1-23. , Benson M., Osbaldiston N., (eds), Basingstoke: Palgrave Macmillan; Burr, V., (2003) Social constructionism, , (2nd ed.), Hove: Routledge; Croucher, S., Privileged mobility in an age of globality (2012) Societies, 2, pp. 1-13. , http://www.mdpi.com/2075-4698/2/1/1, Retrieved from; De Fina, A., Positioning level 3: Connecting local identity displays to macro social processes (2013) Narrative Inquiry, 23 (1), pp. 40-61; De Fina, A., Schiffrin, D., Bamberg, M., Introduction (2006) Discourse and identity, pp. 1-24. , De Fina A., Schiffrin D., Bamberg M., (eds), Cambridge: Cambridge University Press; Deppermann, A., Editorial: Positioning in narrative interaction (2013) Narrative Inquiry, 23 (1), pp. 1-15; Deppermann, A., How to get a grip on identities-in-interaction: (What) does ‘positioning’ offer more than ‘membership categorization’?

Most Jews use Hebrew as their L1, while Arabs use Arabic, both official languages in Israel. Most Arabs tend to live in separate geographical areas and about 10% of Israel’s Arabs live in ‘mixed cities.’ Since neither side defines them as homogeneous, these cities may afford rich insights about Israeli reality. Recently, there has been a growing tendency among Arab parents in mixed cities to send their children to Hebrew-speaking educational settings, especially in preschool years. This study aimed at understanding this phenomenon from both sociolinguistic and psychological perspectives, viewing language as closely related to power and identity as well as to emotions and close relationships. Qualitative information was gathered from interviews with parents, focusing on parents’ motives to send their children to these educational settings and on the impact of this decision on the family’s language policy and emotional interactions. Overall, findings reveal how the external urban setting interacts with the internal family system. The mixed city context appears to invade the family dynamics in mixed ways, and sociopolitical dimensions interact closely with emotional ones. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Arabic; family language policy; Hebrew; Israel; Mixed city; preschool",,,,,,,,,,"Agbaria, A.K., Mustafa, M., Two states for three peoples: The ‘Palestinian-Israeli’ in the future vision documents of the Palestinians in Israel (2012) Ethnic and Racial Studies, 35, pp. 718-736; Altman, C., Feldman-Burstein, Z., Yitzhaki, D., Armon-Lotem, S., Walters, J., Family language policies, reported language use and proficiency in Russian-Hebrew bilingual children in Israel (2014) Journal of Multilingual and Multicultural Development, 35, pp. 216-234; Amara, M.H., (1999) Politics and sociolinguistic reflexes: Palestinian border villages, , Amsterdam: John Benjamins; Amara, M.H., Hebraization reflexes in the Palestinian language landscape in Israel (2014) Challenges for language education and policy: Making space for people, pp. 182-195. , Spolsky B., Inbar-Lourie O., Tannenbaum M., (eds), New York, NY: Routledge; Amara, M.H., Schnell, I., Identity repertoires among Arabs in Israel (2004) Journal of Ethnic and Migration Studies, 30, pp. 175-193; Caldwell-Harris, C.L., Tong, J., Lung, W., Poo, S., Physiological reactivity to emotional phrases in Mandarin-english bilinguals (2010) International Journal of Bilingualism, 15, pp. 329-352; Caspi, D., Limor, Y., (1999) The in/outsiders: The media in Israel, , Cresskill, NJ: Hampton Press; Chen, S.X., Bond, M.H., Two languages, two personalities?

The distribution and representation of languages in posters show the shifting power relations and display the reader positioning in situations of language contact between Traditional Chinese characters, Simplified Chinese characters, Portuguese, English, and written Cantonese. This paper draws on critical discourse analysis to study the realization of commercial, governmental and civic power through a diverse and plurilingual discourse genre. It shows that although governmental authority is still invested in the colonial language of Portuguese, it is not immune from the marketization associated with the language of commercial capital, English. The analysis also indicates that the plurilingualism evoked by governmental authority situates monolingual readers in formal and respectful positions with respect to other languages, commercial ventures seek to earn money by entertaining readers less formally, and civic associations cultivate their readership in flexible ways in accordance with the target sector of the community. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","institutional voice; multilingualism; plurilingualism; Posters; power relations; reader positioning",,,,,,,,,,"Androutsopoulos, J., Bilingualism in the mass media and on the Internet (2007) Bilingualism: A social approach, pp. 207-229. , Heller M., (ed), New York, NY: Palgrave Macmillan; Angermeyer, P.S., Bilingualism meets digraphia: Script alternation and script hybridity in Russian-American writing and beyond (2012) Language mixing and code-switching in writing: Approaches to mixed-language written discourse, pp. 255-272. , Sebba M., Mahootian S., Jonsson C., (eds), London: Routledge; Bailey, B., Heteroglossia and Boundaries (2007) Bilingualism: A social approach, pp. 257-274. , Heller M., (ed), New York, NY: Palgrave; Barthes, R., (1977) Image music text, , New York, NY: Hill and Wang; Ben-Rafael, E., A sociological approach to the study of linguistic landscapes (2009) Linguistic landscape: Expanding the scenery, pp. 40-54. , Shohamy E., Gorter D., (eds), London: Routledge; Blackwood, R.J., Making France’s public space: Empirical surveys on regional heritage languages in two provincial cities (2010) Linguistic landscape in the city, pp. 292-306. , Shohamy E., Ben-Rafael E., Barni M., (eds), Toronto: Multilingual Matters; Bhatia, T.K., Ritchie, W.C., (2013) The handbook of bilingualism and multilingualism, , Chichester: Wiley-Blackwell; (2007) From linguistic diversity to plurilingual education: Guide for the development of language education policies in Europe, , Strasbourg: Language Policy Division; Du Plessis, T., Bloemfontein/Mangaung, ‘city on the move’: Language management and transformation of a non-representative linguistic landscape (2010) Linguistic landscape in the city, pp. 74-95. , Shohamy E., Ben-Rafael E., Barni M., (eds), Toronto: Multilingual Matters; Fairclough, N., (1989) Language and power, , London: Longman; Fairclough, N., Critical discourse analysis and the marketization of public discourse: The universities (1993) Discourse & Society, 4, pp. 133-168; Foucault, M., (1970) The order of discourse: An archaeology of the human sciences, , London: Tavistock; Gafaranga, J., Medium repair vs. other-language repair: Telling the medium of a bilingual conversation (2000) International Journal of Bilingualism, 4 (3), pp. 327-350; Halliday, M.A.K., (1985) An introduction to functional grammar, , London: Edward Arnold; Hanauer, D., (2009), Transnationalizing and historicizing contested place: Graffitti at Abu Dis partially in the municipality of Jerusalem.

The findings revealed that (a) the participating teachers in this study had high(er) self-efficacy but low(er) self-image when teaching English compared to Turkish because of their idealization of native speaker norms; (b) their multiple identities were interacting with each other, and shifting from being a native to a nonnative, and a language teacher to a language user; and (c) their beliefs about teaching and learning coming from their core identity as an English language teacher worked as a catalyst in this process. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","beliefs about teaching and learning; self-efficacy; self-image; Teacher identity",,,,,,,,,,"Akkerman, S.F., Meijer, P.C., A dialogical approach to conceptualizing teacher identity (2011) Teaching and Teacher Education, 27, pp. 308-319; Alptekin, C., Towards intercultural communicative competence in ELT (2002) ELT Journal, 56 (1), pp. 57-64; Atay, D., Reflections on the cultural dimensions of language teaching (2005) Language and Intercultural Communication, 5 (3-4), pp. 222-236; Bandura, A., Exercise of personal and collective efficacy in changing societies (1995) Self-efficacy in changing societies, pp. 1-45. , Bandura A., (ed), Cambridge: Cambridge University Press; Beauchamp, C., Thomas, L., Understanding teacher identity: An overview of issues in the literature and implications for teacher education (2009) Cambridge Journal of Education, 39 (2), pp. 175-189; Beijaard, D., Meijer, P., Verloop, N., Reconsidering research on teachers’ professional identity (2004) Teaching and Teacher Education, 20, pp. 107-128; Beijaard, D., Verloop, N., Vermunt, J.D., Teachers’ perceptions of professional identity: An exploratory study from a personal knowledge perspective (2000) Teaching and Teacher Education, 16, pp. 749-764; Block, D., The structure and agency dilemma in identity and intercultural communication research (2013) Language and Intercultural Communication, 13 (2), pp. 126-147; Boyatzis, R.E., (1998) Transforming qualitative information: Thematic analysis and code development, , Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage; Braine, G., (2010) Nonnative speaker English teachers: Research, pedagogy, and professional growth, , New York, NY: Routledge; Byram, M., Fleming, M., (1998) Language learning in intercultural perspective, , Cambridge: Cambridge University Press; Cepik, S., Polat, N., Mandates, needs, equitable resources, and current research in English language teacher education: The case of Turkey (2014) International Journal of Research Studies in Education, 3 (2), pp. 83-96; Charmaz, K., (2006) Constructing grounded theory: A practical guide through qualitative analysis, , London: Cromwell Press; Chen, X., Identity construction and negotiation within and across school communities: The case of one English-as-a-new-language student (ENL) student (2010) Journal of Language, Identity and Education, 9 (3), pp. 163-179; Clarke, M., (2008) Language teacher identities: Co-constructing discourse and community, , Clevedon, UK: Multilingual Matters; Davies, A., (2003) The native speaker: Myth and reality, , Clevedon: Cromwell Press; Day, C., Kington, A., Stobart, G., Sammons, P., The personal and professional selves of teachers: stable and unstable identities (2006) British Educational Research Journal, 32 (4), pp. 601-616; Duff, P.A., Uchida, Y., The negotiation of teachers’ sociocultural identities and practices in postsecondary EFL classrooms (1997) TESOL Quarterly, 31 (3), pp. 451-486; Duru, S., The influences on teacher identity and the suggestions for the new teacher identities (2006) Eurasian Journal of Educational Research, 22, pp. 121-131; Faez, F., Reconceptualizing the native/nonnative speaker dichotomy (2011) Journal of Language, Identity & Education, 10 (4), pp. 231-249; Gee, J.P., (1999) Introduction to discourse analysis: Theory and method, , London: Routledge; Gibbs, C., Explaining effective teaching: Self-efficacy and thought control of action (2003) Journal of Educational Enquiry, 4, pp. 1-14. , doi:10.1.1.113.2245; Huang, I., Contextualizing teacher identity of non-native-English speakers in US secondary ESL classrooms: A Bakhtinian perspective (2014) Linguistics and Education, 25, pp. 119-128; Juhász, A., Native EFL teachers’ self-perception of their teaching behaviour: A qualitative study (2011) WoPaLP, 5, pp. 86-99; Kanno, Y., Stuart, C., Learning to become a second language teacher: Identities-in-practice (2011) The Modern Language Journal, 95, pp. 236-252; Kelchtermans, G., Getting the story, understanding the lives: from career stories to teachers’ professional development (1993) Teaching and Teacher Education, 9 (5-6), pp. 443-456; Knowles, J.G., Models for understanding pre-service and beginning teachers’ biographies: Illustrations from case studies (1992) Studying teachers’ lives, pp. 99-152. , Goodson I.F., (ed), London: Routledge; Medgyes, P., Native or non-native: Who’s worth more?

This article attempts to bridge this gap by investigating a group of international scholars from Mainland China, Malaysia, Hong Kong, Singapore, and Taiwan residing in Northern Ireland with regard to the effects, perceptions, and experiences of engaging in a community of practice within a religious ethnic community institution. Qualitative data were collected and analyzed through a thematic analysis based on the participants’ identified perceptions as the basis for data interpretation. The findings point to several salient conceptualizations such as multilingualism, multiculturalism, heritage cultural identity, and academic as well as social acculturation that have all played an essential role in sustaining their shared ethnicity through such a mutual engagement. Their language and cultural identities are also revealed to be shaped and reshaped from various collaborative efforts in the same community. The assumed paradigm of bilingualism and biculturalism has thus been shifted to multilingualism and multiculturalism during this process predicated on their reoriented language and cultural identities as well as academic and social spheres. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","acculturation; biculturalism; bilingualism; community of practice; international scholars; multiculturalism; multilingualism; Religious ethnic community institution",,,,,,,,,,"Bucholtz, M., Hall, K., Identity and interaction: A sociocultural linguistic approach (2005) Discourse Studies, 7, pp. 585-614; Burr, V., (1995) An introduction to social constructionism, , London: Routledge; Canagarajah, S., Lingua franca English, multilingual communities, and language acquisition (2007) The Modern Language Journal, 91, pp. 923-939; Cavallaro, F., Language maintenance revisited: An Australian perspective (2005) Bilingual Research Journal, 29, pp. 561-582; Cho, G., The role of HL in social interactions and relationships: Reflections from a language minority group (2000) Bilingual Research Journal, 24, pp. 333-348; Choi, J.K., Identity and language: Korean speaking Korean, Korean-American speaking Korean and English?

While research focusing on the use of English in higher education is growing, little attention has been paid to out-of-class contexts. This paper reports on the identity formation of an undergraduate who lived in a multicultural residential hall on an English-medium campus in Hong Kong through ethnographic narrative inquiry. The combination of ethnographic observations and informal talks with the participant in the research field for a two-year period, the participant's Facebook posts and photographs as records of his hall life and three intensive face-to-face interviews generated rich data for the inquiry. The participant was described as a local–non-local ‘hybrid’ because of his dual identity of being both local and non-local. Drawing on Wenger's framework of social theory of identity formation, this paper revealed the challenges of internationalisation in higher education through the perspective of the ‘hybrid’ with both local and non-local identities. An important implication arising from the study is the need to take a closer look at cultural integration and internationalisation in out-of-class contexts. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","English as a lingua franca; hall residence; higher education; Identity; internationalisation; out-of-class contexts",,,,,,,,,,"Baker, S., Conceptualising the use of Facebook in ethnographic research: As tool, as data and as context (2013) Ethnography and Education, 8 (2), pp. 131-145; Beneito-Montagut, R., Ethnography goes online: Towards a user-centred methodology to research interpersonal communication on the internet (2011) Qualitative Research, 11 (6), pp. 716-735; Clandinin, D.J., Connelly, F.M., (2000) Narrative inquiry: Experience and story in qualitative research, , San Francisco, CA: Jossey-Bass; Creswell, J.W., (2013) Qualitative inquiry & research design: Choosing among five approaches, , 3rd ed., Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage; Edu-Buandoh, D.F., Otchere, G., Speak English!” A prescription or choice of English as a lingua franca in Ghanaian schools (2012) Linguistics and Education, 23 (3), pp. 301-309; Egron-Polak, E., Internationalization of higher education: A few global trends and regional perspectives (2012) The globalization of higher education, pp. 57-69. , Ennew C., Greenaway D., (eds), Hampshire, UK: Palgrave Macmillan; Egron-Polak, E., Hudson, R., (2010) Internationalization of higher education: Global trends regional perspectives – IAU 3rd Global survey report, , Paris: International Association of Universities; Gass, S.M., Mackey, A., (2000) Stimulated recall methodology in second language research, , Mahwah, NJ: L.

As students demonstrated their intercultural learning and perspectives, how did they (re)interpret and (re)construct the IEREST learning materials? Data drew on questionnaires, reflective journals, and focus groups from two groups of mobile university students (in Italy and the UK). The findings illustrated how students’ initial expectations of the programme (meeting new people and improving language) were exceeded. Through reflection on experience and discussion with peer, tutors and members of the host community, students realised that ‘interculturality’ is multifaceted and complex; they expanded their small culture spheres to explore community cultures (gender, age, and locality); they acknowledged the effort, work, and time required in interpreting bilateral understandings of self and other, and the possibilities of such understandings for global/intercultural citizenship. The outcomes offer implications for intercultural learning and training in the study abroad context, materials development, and further research concerning student mobility and intercultural education in other contexts. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Experiential learning; Global citizen; Intercultural training; Interculturality; Study abroad",,,,,,"Directorate-General for Education and Culture, EAC

I first outline the context of UK HE and its internationalisation agenda, discussing how research in this field has conceptualised language, intercultural communication (IC) and international students in terms of a totalising boundary between self and other. I link this to current concerns in IC regarding the philosophical underpinnings of the field, specifically the aporia created as a result of the totalising self/other relation in prevailing IC discourse. I then present a means of addressing this aporia through a Bakhtinian theorisation of the relationship between language and intercultural learning. This theorisation offers a relational perspective on the self and the other in which intercultural learning is a process of ideological becoming with the other, enacted in, with and through language, as illustrated in Federica’s story of learning English. The article concludes with a call for language and communicative practices to be placed at the heart of HE internationalisation agendas and for HE practitioners to recognise shared responsibility for IC. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Dialogism; Higher education; Ideological becoming; Intercultural learning; Language learning; Mobile/international students",,,,,,,,,,"Asante, M.K., Yoshitaka, M., (2008) The global intercultural communication reader, , Oxford: Routledge; Bakhtin, M.M., (1981) The dialogic imagination: Four essays, , (M.

At some times they focus on the cultural threads that they bring with them that enable the sharing of cultural experience, the crossing of cultural boundaries and the potential for engaging creatively and critically with new cultural domains. At other times, within a softer non-essentialism, they focus on cultural blocks that, while acknowledging diversity, reinforce the notion of uncrossable cultural boundaries. Both are modes of making sense of and constructing culture; and their mixing demonstrates how we can all employ conflicting discourses of culture at the same time. However, for both cultural travellers and researchers, focusing on cultural threads will be more effective in combating the cultural prejudice and global politics that underpin essentialism. Revealing cultural threads requires a specific methodology in talking to people about culture and recognising the potentials for sharing.

This paper analyzes the responses of pre-departure, while-abroad, and upon-return students of different academic backgrounds (N = 990) to an open question that asked them to name the three most essential factors for making their stay abroad experience successful. This question was part of a wider online questionnaire distributed in Europe by the IEREST project (http://ierest-project.eu). A sequential mixed-method procedure identified six themes that were frequently cited: language and communication, social contacts, practicalities, personal development, academic advantages, and travel. This paper presents a more detailed analysis of the first three themes. It shows that although language proficiency was the single most frequently mentioned aspect, students attached particular importance to aspects of personal development (in particular with respect to openness) and social contacts (crucially including friendship). These findings informed the development of teaching materials within IEREST for supporting intercultural learning in the Erasmus context and may also be relevant to educators and researchers in various other study abroad contexts. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","IEREST; Language proficiency; Personal development; Social contacts; Student perceptions; Study abroad",,,,,,"Education, Audiovisual and Culture Executive Agency, EACEA

The analysis reveals the discursive ‘methods’ that students and staff, as plurilingual speakers whose repertoire includes a lesser-spoken language such as Danish and Catalan, display in order to ‘make sense’ of their language choice, which places the local (Danish) language in a clearly subsidiary position in the life of the university. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Englishisation; Internationalisation in HE; Language choices; Language discourses; MCA",,,,,,,,,,"Baker, C., Locating culture in action: Membership categorisation in texts and talk (2000) Culture and text: Discourse and methodology in social research and cultural studies, pp. 99-113. , Lee A., Poynton C., (eds), St Leonards: Allen & Unwin; Beelen, J., De Wit, H., (2012) Internationalisation revisited: New dimensions in the internationalisation of higher education, , Amsterdam: CAREM; Block, D., Globalisation and language teaching (2010) Handbook of language and globalisation, pp. 287-304. , Coupland N., (ed), Oxford: Blackwell; Block, D., Citizenship, education and global spaces (2011) Language and Intercultural Communication, 11, pp. 161-169; Blommaert, J., (2010) The sociolinguistics of globalization, , Cambridge: Cambridge University Press; Bourdieu, P., (1991) Language and symbolic power, , Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press; Collentine, J., Study abroad research: Findings, implications and future directions (2011) The handbook of language teaching, pp. 218-233. , Long M., Doughty C., (eds), Malden, MA: Wiley-Blackwell; Europeans and their languages (2012) Special Eurobarometer, 386, pp. 12-22. , http://ec.europa.eu/COMMFrontOffice/PublicOpinion/index.cfm/ResultDoc/download/DocumentKy/56904, Retrieved from; Hannerz, U., Cosmopolitans and locals in world culture (1990) Theory, Culture & Society, 7, pp. 237-251; Heller, M., Globalization, the new economy, and the commodification of language and identity (2003) Journal of Sociolinguistics, 7, pp. 473-492; Hester, S., Les catégories en contexte (1994) L’enquête sur les catégories: De Durkheim à Sacks, pp. 219-242. , Fradin B., Quéré L., Widmer J., (eds), Paris: École des Hautes Études en Sciences Sociales; Housley, W., Fitzgerald, R., The reconsidered model of membership categorization analysis (2002) Qualitative Research, 2, pp. 59-83; Hughes, R., (2008), http://www.oecd.org/site/imhe2006bis/37464216.pdf, Internationalisation of higher education and language policy.

In this paper, it is argued that the complexity and diversity of languages, communities and cultures present in many HE institutes mean we can no longer assume a connection between the language of instruction, a local host community and a national culture and language. This is particularly the case in English medium instruction programmes outside of Anglophones settings but also in international universities in Anglophone settings, both of which will be the focus of this paper. The term transcultural university is adopted to reflect this complexity and to move beyond nation-based conceptions of universities. In educating students for mobility in such environments, it is suggested that pedagogy needs to go beyond essentialist language, culture and nation correlations. Intercultural awareness is proposed as a crucial element in preparing students to negotiate the diversity and fluidity of communicative practices in transcultural universities in which mobile students need equally mobile communicative resources. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Education; English as an academic lingua franca; Intercultural awareness; Intercultural communication; Student mobility; Transcultural university",,,,,,,,,,"Baker, W., The cultures of English as a lingua franca (2009) TESOL Quarterly, 43 (4), pp. 567-592; Baker, W., Intercultural awareness: Modelling an understanding of cultures in intercultural communication through English as a lingua franca (2011) Language and Intercultural Communication, 11 (3), pp. 197-214; Baker, W., (2015) Culture and identity through English as a lingua franca: Rethinking concepts and goals in intercultural communication, , Berlin: De Gruyter Mouton; Bayyurt, Y., Akcan, S., (2015) Current perspectives on pedagogy for English as a lingua franca, , Berlin: De Gruyter Mouton; Beaven, A., Borghetti, C., (2014), http://ierest-project.eu/sites/default/files/Progress_report.pdf, IEREST public progress report.

The longitudinal study explores how she coped over time with the various adaptation demands that she faced in the different aspects of her life: social–personal aspects (friends and social life, daily life, language for socialisation) and academic aspects (courses, administrative issues, language for academic purposes). The data gathered involved pre-departure and post return interviews, weekly ‘diary-tables’ and monthly interviews while abroad. The findings show that Angela's adaptive journey followed noticeably different trends in the personal and academic domains of her life, demonstrating clearly how adaptation can evolve at different speeds in these different domains, and can result in ups and downs throughout the sojourn. Even an aspect such as language was perceived differently in the two overarching domains. Further research is needed in order to identify whether there are more generalised patterns within these various domains, or whether the patterns are always subject to significant individual and contextual variation. Moreover, further qualitative research is needed in order to understand the reasons that lie behind the ups and downs, and the extent to which they seem to be idiosyncratic or predictable. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Adaptation; Case study; Erasmus; Student mobility; Study abroad",,,,,,,,,,"Adelman, M.B., Cross-cultural adjustment: A theoretical perspective on social support (1988) International Journal of Intercultural Relations, 12, pp. 183-204; Alred, G., Byram, M., Fleming, M., (2003) Intercultural experience and education, , Clevedon: Multilingual Matters; Andrade, M.S., International students in English-speaking universities: Adjustment factors (2006) Journal of Research in International Education, 5 (2), pp. 131-154; Belz, J.A., The development of intercultural communicative competence in telecollaborative partnerships (2007) Online intercultural exchange.

These need to be accompanied by procedures to assess student needs prior to and during their time abroad as well as upon their return. In the exploratory study reported here, we use Dynamic Assessment (DA) to examine international students’ interculturality and learning needs when interpreting Critical Incidents (CIs). DA integrates teaching, learning, and assessment by providing mediation to reveal the cognitive processes behind student performance. Four empirically derived incidents were presented to 13 international students studying in the UK. Students worked in pairs and were asked to interpret the CIs. Appropriate interpretations of the CIs involved identifying the issues from different perspectives; anticipating emotions, behaviour and problems for different participants; and negotiating situations and solutions. Interaction data were qualitatively analysed for instances of relevant (meta-)cognitive processes and emerging learning. Results indicate the potential of DA to provide an empirical diagnosis of student interculturality and learning needs, and thus a starting point for the design of enrichment programmes to optimize students’ development while abroad by meeting students where they are and moving them towards the desired abilities and objectives. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Critical incidents; Diagnostic assessment; Dynamic assessment; Interculturality; Mediation; Student mobility",,,,,,,,,,"Anderson, D., Nashon, S., Predators of knowledge construction: Interpreting students’ metacognition in an amusement park physics program (2007) Science Education, 91 (2), pp. 298-320; Anderson, L., Krathwohl, D., (2001) A taxonomy for learning, teaching and assessing: A revision of Bloom’s taxonomy of educational objectives, , New York, NY: Longman; Arasaratnam, L.A., Doerfel, M.L., Intercultural communication competence: Identifying key components from multicultural perspectives (2005) International Journal of Intercultural Relations, 29, pp. 137-163; Barrett, M., Byram, M., Lázár, I., Mompoint-Gaillard, P., Philippou, S., (2013) Developing intercultural competence through education, , Strasbourg: Council of Europe; Bennett, M., Towards ethnorelativism: A developmental model of intercultural sensitivity (1993) Education for the intercultural experience, pp. 21-71. , Paige R., (ed), Yarmouth, ME: Intercultural Press; Bhawuk, D., Evolution of culture assimilators: Toward theory-based assimilators (2001) International Journal of Intercultural Relations, 25, pp. 141-163; Black, P., Harrison, C., Lee, C., Marshall, B., Wiliam, D., (2003) Assessment for learning: Putting it into practice, , Buckingham: Open University Press; Borghetti, C., (2015), Considerations on dynamic assessment of intercultural competence.

The paper, directed to an audience of practitioners involved in study abroad preparation, focuses on the feedback received from different stakeholders involved in the initial piloting of the activity, in seven HE institutions. Overall, the activity was considered original and innovative, theoretically solid and engaging for the students. The critical points considered involved the time required to adapt the activity to the specific context in which it was taught, and the need to manage students’ expectations by clarifying that the aim was not to provide practical advice and information about specific destinations, but to make them reflect on what intercultural encounters can offer in terms of personal development. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Identity; IEREST project; Intercultural education; Intercultural encounters; Mobility students; Stereotyping; Study abroad",,,,,,,,,,"Alred, G., Byram, M., Fleming, M., (2003) Intercultural experience and education, , Clevedon: Multilingual Matters; Anquetil, M., (2006) Mobilité Erasmus et communication interculturelle, , Bern: Peter Lang; Beaven, A., Borghetti, C., (2014), http://ierest-project.eu/sites/default/files/Progress_report.pdf, IEREST public progress report.

Previous research on national and local policies surrounding this phenomenon has identified different discourses of internationalisation which may have an effect on practices such as student mobility. In order to understand better the role of student mobility in practice, the article analyses responses to an inquiry about internationalisation to a group of academic staff involved in intercultural education from universities around the world. Informants, all members of the research network Cultnet, working at 28 different universities in 15 countries, describe internationalisation within their practice, and their understanding of the role which student mobility plays in relation to this. Data were collected through questionnaires and interviews over a period of six months. The findings locate student mobility within discourses of internationalisation. They also raise questions in relation to the need for an intercultural dialogue approach in internationalisation. We argue that institutions and their staff should be aware of the discursive field of internationalisation in Higher Education, take a critical stance and analyse their own role in student mobility. How mobility fits within the field of intercultural education for incoming, outgoing and ‘home’ students should be highlighted and clarified in internationalisation agendas. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Higher education; Intercultural dialogue; Internationalisation; Student mobility",,,,,,,,,,"Allport, G., (1954) The nature of prejudice, , New York, NY: Addison-Wesley; Alred, G., Byram, M., Fleming, M., (2006) Education for intercultural citizenship.

Compared with many of the other participants, she displayed a more positive attitude toward the host language and culture, developed a more diverse social network, and gained more access to local communities of practice. Over time, she became more open-minded and invested in her intercultural relationships which she mediated through English. Weaving together the rich oral and written data related to her case, this paper presents a narrative of her ‘international story’. Her lived experiences and the subjective meanings invoked raise awareness of individual characteristics, attributes, and agency that can facilitate second language learning and intercultural development. By drawing comparisons with the stories of her peers, this narrativized account also points to the impact of external elements on sojourn outcomes. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Academic mobility; Case studies; Identity; International exchange programs; Narrative inquiry; Second language learning",,,,,,,,,,"Allen, H.W., Language-learning motivation during short-term study abroad (2010) Foreign Language Annals, 43, pp. 27-49; Bazeley, P., Jackson, K., (2013) Qualitative data analysis with Nvivo, , 2nd ed., Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage; Berry, J.W., Poortinga, Y.H., Breugelmans, S.M., Chasiotis, A., Sam, D.L., (2011) Cross-cultural psychology: Research and applications, , 3rd ed., Cambridge: Cambridge University Press; Block, D., (2007) Second language identities, , London: Continuum; Byram, M., Conceptualizing intercultural (communicative) competence and intercultural citizenship (2012) Routledge handbook of language and intercultural communication, pp. 85-97. , Jackson J., (ed), Abingdon: Routledge; Chik, A., Benson, P., Frequent flyer: A narrative of overseas study in English (2008) Narratives of learning and teaching EFL, pp. 155-168. , Kalaja P., Menezes V., Barcelos A.M.F., (eds), Basingstoke: Palgrave MacMillan; Clandinin, D.J., (2013) Engaging in narrative inquiry, , Walnut Creek, CA: Left Coast Press; Clandinin, D.J., Rosiek, J., Mapping a landscape of narrative inquiry: Borderland spaces and tensions (2007) Handbook of narrative inquiry: Mapping a methodology, pp. 35-75. , Clandinin D.J., (ed), Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage; Coleman, J.A., Researching whole people and whole lives (2013) Social and cultural aspects of language learning in study abroad, pp. 17-46. , Kinginger C., (ed), Philadelphia, PA: John Benjamins; Connelly, F.M., Clandinin, D.J., Narrative inquiry (2006) Handbook of complementary methods in education research, pp. 375-385. , Green J., Camilli G., Elmore P., (eds), Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum; Diao, W., Study abroad, participation, and turn-taking (2011) Selected proceedings of the 2010 second language research forum, pp. 1-17. , Granena G., Koeth J., Lee-Ellis S., Lukyanchenko A., Botano P., Rhoades E., (eds), Somerville, MA: Cascadilla Proceedings Project; Edhlund, B., McDougall, A., (2013) NVivo 10 essentials, , Stallarholmen: Form and Kunskap; Harlow, L.L., Do they mean what they say?

The activity ‘24h Erasmus Life’ aims at making students reflect on four interrelated areas of their sojourn: the emotional impact of living abroad, the understanding of how communication works within a different academic community, the broader social dimension of the experiences, and the identity-related language issues. In Autumn 2014, the activity was tested with two different groups of students by teachers at the University of Bologna (UNIBO): the first group (A) was formed by 18 international incoming students and was taught by face-to-face teaching in Bologna; the second group (B) comprised 23 UNIBO students who were doing their study abroad in a variety of European countries, and participated in the activity by means of a Learning Management System. This paper traces the main instructional phases of ‘24h Erasmus Life’, and comments on the students’ learning experiences by reporting extracts from transcribed peer-to-peer class interactions (Group A) and from class blog and forums (Group B).

Participant interviews are used to examine learners’ perceptions of language-exchange learning and the affordances it offers. The results show substantive variation between participants in the ways they mediate affordances in language-exchange interactions. Their choices and actions in the interaction are affected by their perceptions of language-exchange learning and their mutual relationships with their partners. The study suggests that learners may develop an increased sense of agency through language-exchange interactions. It also reveals that engagement in metalinguistic and intercultural dialogues is not an automatic product of language-exchange interactions but is a demonstration of the learner's conscious efforts to create opportunities for learning. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.","affordance; language exchange; Learner agency; learner interaction; reciprocal learning",,,,,,,,,,"Allen, H., Interactive contact as linguistic affordance during short-term study abroad: Myth or reality (2010) Frontiers: The Interdisciplinary Journal of Study Abroad, 19, pp. 1-19; Appel, M.C., (1999), Tandem language learning by email: Some basic principles and a case study [CLCS Occasional Paper No. 54].

It is argued that Brecht's pedagogical views on theatre connect to those interculturalists who prioritise the embodied dimensions of intercultural encounters over a competence-driven orientation. Both share a love for aesthetic experimentation as the basis for learning and critical engagement with a complex world. The article outlines how a Brechtian theatre pedagogy was enacted as part of four drama-based research workshops, which were designed to explore international students’ intercultural ‘strangeness’ experiences. It is described how a participant account of an intercultural encounter was turned into a Brechtian playscript by the author and then performed by participants. The analysis is based on the author's as well as the performers’ reflections on the scripting process and their performance experiences. It is argued that a Brechtian pedagogy can lead to collective learning experiences, critical reflection and an embodied understanding of intercultural experience in research. The data produced by a Brechtian research pedagogy is considered ‘slippery’ (aesthetic) data. It is full of metaphoric gaps and suitably resonates the affective dimensions and subjective positionings that constitute intercultural encounters. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.","arts-based research; Brechtian theatre pedagogy; critical creative pedagogy; de-centred methodology; drama-based research; intercultural education research",,,,,,,,,,"Axtmann, A., Transcultural performance in classroom learning (2002) Body and language: Intercultural learning through drama, pp. 37-50. , Bräuer G., (ed), Westport: Ablex; Bacon, J., The feeling of the experience: A methodology for performance ethnography (2006) Research methodologies for drama education, pp. 135-158. , Ackroyd J., (ed), Stoke on Trent: Trentham Books; Barro, A., Jordan, S., Roberts, C., Cultural practice in everyday life: The language learner as ethnographer (1998) Language learning in intercultural perspective: Approaches through drama and ethnography, pp. 76-97. , Byram M., Fleming M., (eds), Cambridge: University Press; Bourdieu, P., (1991) Language and symbolic power, , Cambridge: Polity Pres; Bräuer, G., (2002) Body and language: Intercultural learning through drama, , Westport: Ablex Publishin; Brecht, B., (1965) The Messingkauf dialogues, , London: Methuen; Brecht, B., Müller, C., Manheim, R., (1977) The Measures Taken and other Lehrstücke, , (Trans.), London, New Delhi: Bloomsbur; Brecht, B., Willett, J., (1964) Brecht on theatre, , London: Methuen; Bredella, L., (2004) Rezeptionsasthetische Literaturdidaktik, , Tübingen: Narr; Bredella, L., (2010) Das Verstehen des Anderen.

In a context of increasing linguistic and cultural diversity in the Republic of Ireland, this article reports on a research project which set out to explore the attitudes of groups of Irish undergraduate students towards the languages which they come into contact with in their daily lives, in particular, the Irish language, using a focus group method. Four themes in particular emerge in the students’ discussion of Irish as they encounter it in their everyday lives: ‘functionality’, ‘a hidden agenda’, ‘exclusivity’, and ‘heightened culture’. The metapragmatic comments of the respondents indicate deep ambivalence towards use of the Irish language, as well as complex language-ideological positions. The linguistic authority [Woolard, 2008.

As part of a larger study interviewing 49 migrant workers in Japan, this study focuses upon 10 specific individual accounts of Assistant English Language Teachers' (ALTs) medical encounters and interactions with Japanese medical providers (JMPs) in Japan to uncover: (a) discursive practices ALTs use to (de)-legitimize JMPs and (b) cultural assumptions ALTs expect of JMPs. In particular, three ways are uncovered wherein terms of talk between ALTs and JMPs influenced perceptions and conceptions of medical interaction in Japan. First, place was rendered meaningful by ALTs by using two interrelated terms: ‘back home' and ‘here.' Such demarcations operated to (de)-legitimize the medical professional's practices, procedures, and credibility. Second, construals of ‘good' and ‘bad' providers are highlighted as ALTs attempted to make sense of their medical interactions. Finally, the relationship between ALTs’ conception of space and place are considered in light of ALTs’ provider construals.

The study makes use of a combination of retrospective life-history research and the analysis of academic documents to look at the interrelationship between teachers’ identities and their degree of investment in academic and professional activities. The analysis revealed marked differences in the ways in which these two groups of teachers’ identities have been developed. While the locally educated teachers have constructed strong and articulated identities as a result of a stable family context and smooth transitions in their lives, the development of their returnee counterparts’ identities has been characterized by fragmentation due to the little, or lack of, stability in their home contexts as well as the complex and painful transitions in their lives. The paper discusses the impact that these differences have on participants’ degrees of investment in educational and work-related opportunities available to them in their contexts.

Given the interpreters' theoretically prescribed role as animator in such interactions, it is particularly interesting to investigate how interpreters deal with small talk, while this type of talk may also offer important opportunities to clients for constructing interpersonal relationships with professionals. This study focuses on recordings of naturally occurring interpreted interactions in a medical context and the analyses demonstrate that almost all small talk is oriented to the interpreters. These thus hold a pivotal role in small talk sequences and this allows them to do a wide variety of identity work far beyond the prescribed role of translator. Finally, there is only limited evidence that small talk may contribute to establishing an interpersonal relationship between clients and professionals across language barriers. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.","identity; interpreting; medical interactions; participation framework; Small talk",,,,,,,,,,"Angermeyer, P.S., Translation style and participant roles in court interpreting (2009) Journal of Sociolinguistics, 13 (1), pp. 3-28; Antaki, C., (2002), http://www-staff.lboro.ac.uk/ssca1/notation.htm, An introductory tutorial in conversation analysis.

This study analyses the language attitudes of Catalan, as well as the possible explanatory variables for such attitudes, for a large sample with a high proportion of immigrant students and a great linguistic diversity. A questionnaire was given to 1206 second- and fourth-year secondary school students from which linguistic attitudes were evaluated. The questionnaire also evaluated the socio-cultural level and socio-professional level of the students’ families, age on arrival and length of stay of the immigrant students in the host country. Results show that most attitudes are favourable, although the rate of neutral attitudes is significant in all groups. It is seen as necessary to work specifically with Spanish-speaking students within the immigrant group, as they showed less favourable attitudes towards Catalan than the rest. The language spoken at home was significant with regard to attitudes towards Catalan and Spanish, while the age on arrival and the length of stay were significant with regard to attitudes towards Catalan, English and the immigrants’ L1. These results allow for the potential implementation of educational interventions to improve the coexistence of these languages in school. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.","classroom community; cultural diversity; immigrants students; Language attitudes; linguistic diversity",,,,,,"EDU2014-54093-R

While theories on intercultural learning generally acknowledge that the ‘context’ of the individual learning experience plays an important role for intercultural learning processes, a detailed understanding of what it is we call ‘context’ in the twenty-first century is mostly missing – as are studies that focus particularly on the role of out-of-class learning environments for intercultural encounter. The contextuality of intercultural learning experiences is demonstrated by the role locations play for intercultural learners while forming complex and interwoven networks, involving human actors, practices and objects. As such, the contribution context makes to intercultural practice, often remains unnoticed, with context representing merely a backdrop of the researched activities. In order to make the locality of context and its highly networked, dynamic nature more accessible to research in the intercultural education field, the ‘intercultural field’ metaphor is revisited and discussed on the basis of a mobile methods study and three emerging themes: the role of relationality, the production of the ‘intercultural field’ and the relevance of spatial–global transformations. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.","context; intercultural field; Intercultural learning; place; relationality; space",,,,,,,,,,"Appadurai, A., (1996) Modernity at large: Cultural dimensions of globalization, , Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press; Bauman, Z., (2000) Liquid modernity, , Cambridge: Polity; Ben Rafael, E., A sociological approach to the study of linguistic landscapes (2009) Linguistic landscape: Expanding the scenery, pp. 40-55. , Shohamy E., Gorter D., (eds), London: Routledge; Benson, P., Language learning and teaching beyond the classroom: An introduction to the field (2011) Beyond the language classroom, pp. 7-17. , Benson P., Reinders H., (eds), London: Palgrave Macmillan; Benson, P., Reinders, H., (2011) Beyond the language classroom, , London: Palgrave Macmillan; Blommaert, J., (2010) The sociolinguistics of globalization, , Cambridge: Cambridge University Press; Bourdieu, P., (1984) Distinction: A social critique of the judgement of taste, , Nice R., (ed), Harvard: Harvard University Press; Büscher, M., Urry, J., Witchger, K., (2011) Mobile methods, , New York: Routledge; Byram, M., Grundy, P., Introduction: Context and culture in language teaching and learning (2003) Context and culture in language teaching and learning, pp. 1-17. , Byram M., Grundy P., (eds), Clevedon: Multilingual Matters; Canagarajah, S., (2013) Translingual practice: Global Englishes and cosmopolitan relations, , New York: Routledge; Charmaz, K., (2006) Constructing grounded theory: A practical guide, , 2nd ed., London: Sage; Online, O.E.D., (2014) Oxford: Oxford University Press.

We find that language is indeed an issue in hotel reviews, but to varying degrees according to the language group of the tourists. French and especially Spanish-speaking tourists refer far more frequently to language experiences, and in particular to the use of their mother tongue, than German-speaking tourists. According to the ‘face model of language choice’, this means that French- and Spanish-speaking tourists emphasize more explicitly their ‘ethnolinguistic face’ than German-speaking tourists. Also, the positive–negative polarity of the judgments differs, with Spanish-speaking tourists at the most positive pole, and French-speaking tourists at the most negative pole. Furthermore, the data also reveal that the use of the mother tongue of the tourist and the use of an international link language (by default, English) are functionally different options, and that the use of English even may lead to face-threatening situations. By comparing the data with staff-related judgments and hotel ratings, it is shown that language plays a specific and independent role in the hotel reviews. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.","2.0 hotel reviews; Language attitudes; language policy; multilingual communication; tourism studies",,,,,,,,,,"Akehurst, G., User generated content: The use of blogs for tourism organisations and tourism consumers (2009) Service Business, 3, pp. 51-61; Basala, S.L., Klenosky, D.B., Travel-style preferences for visiting a novel destination: A conjoint investigation across the novelty-familiarity continuum (2001) Journal of Travel Research, 40 (2), pp. 172-182; Blue, G.M., Harun, M., Hospitality language as a professional skill (2003) English for Specific Purposes, 22, pp. 73-91; Bosangit, C., McCabe, S., Hibbert, S., What is told in travel blogs?

As a result, the ultimate goal of foreign language (FL) education is being shifted from communicative competence to intercultural communicative competence (ICC). In China, this calls for an understanding of the status quo of ICC assessment in FL. The aim of the present study, which is a part of a nation-wide survey, is to investigate the opinions and attitudes of teachers of English as a Foreign Language (EFL) in China on assessment of ICC and to gauge how and to what extent these beliefs are reflected in their classroom implementation. Data were collected from 1170 Chinese university EFL teachers by means of a questionnaire. The analysis reveals that, despite a willingness to assess ICC, the EFL teachers lack a clear conception of ICC. This leads to confusion about what should be assessed and how to assess it, and to deficiencies in their attempts to measure students' ICC in the classroom. Possible reasons for the deficiencies are explored and solutions proposed. The findings from this empirical study have implications for intercultural language teaching in China. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.","foreign language assessment; intercultural communicative competence (ICC); Intercultural communicative language teaching (ICLT); teachers' perception and practice",,,,,,"13C018

Mobility may provide unparalleled learning opportunities for all stakeholders; however, in order to live and work in plural societies as socially responsible and intercultural knowledgeable citizens, intercultural awareness and intercultural communication skills need to be mastered. In parallel, the relevance of a digital agenda and the studies that attest to the positive student engagement brought about by the inclusion of information and communication technologies (ICT) across all grade levels push educators to seek and incorporate technology-based learning and teaching strategies. Digital Storytelling was implemented in an undergraduate degree in Business Communication, where students discuss and reflect on key issues in Intercultural Communication. Our case study draws on the qualitative analysis of a questionnaire, which intended to understand student perceptions regarding an assignment where they are asked to create Digital Stories and consider on the their own reflection process regarding intercultural differences and communicating across cultures. Our analysis of the 140 questionnaires revealed that Digital Storytelling was able to engage students in a serious and productive debate revolving around technology-enhanced learning and cultural differences, empowering them to construct new personal and group meanings and improve their intercultural awareness. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.","Digital storytelling; HE; intercultural awareness; student engagement; technology-enhanced learning",,,,,,,,,,"Alm, C.O., Roth, D., Sproat, R., (2005), Emotions from text: Machine learning for text-based emotion prediction.

Further, it analyzes the role of and the place given to heritage languages (HL) in the development of a multilingual and intercultural competence in schools. In the scope of the study mentioned above, a survey was conducted using an online questionnaire distributed to students from a migrant background. These students attended two primary and secondary schools in the central region of Portugal during the academic year 2013–2014. Results show that the respondents value their HL and perceive them as an instrument of social interaction as well as identity construction and affirmation. Additionally, the results show that both school and teachers recognize and respect the students’ linguistic and cultural capital as well as their composite and plural identities. However, they do not take advantage of this in the classroom by not promoting activities that enrich their students’ cultural and linguistic culture. In this context, the possibilities for an education in/with HL, as a pedagogical and didactic project, are not yet present in the school curriculum and habitus, on the one hand, because there are no educational language policies that incorporate it, and on the other hand, because both school and teachers do not seem to value the role and usefulness of HL in the promotion of an intercultural and multilingual education. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.","Heritage languages; intercultural education; linguistic and cultural minorities; multilingual and intercultural competence; multilingual repertoire",,,,,,"Programa Operacional TemÃ¡tico Factores de Competitividade, POFC

The language teacher's task is to develop in their students the knowledge, skills and attitudes that will help them interact with interlocutors coming from different cultural, linguistic and national backgrounds. Therefore, a thorough understanding of the role of intercultural communicative competence (ICC) and the expertise on how it should be developed in a classroom have become essential attributes of an L2 teacher. The article presents a research study whose aim was to investigate the student teachers’ perception of ICC in an L2 classroom and verify whether their opinions are influenced by their major field of study. The results were collected by means of a survey distributed among undergraduate student teachers of English from three departments at the University of Wrocław: the Department of English, the Department of German and the Department of History. The results indicate that even though the students were able to provide relatively accurate definitions of ICC, their perception of the role of culture in a language classroom was to some extent based on the traditional, knowledge-oriented approaches. Moreover, the major field of study appeared to affect the students’ approaches to developing ICC in the classroom. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.","Foreign language education; initial teacher education; intercultural communicative competence; pre-service teachers; student teachers’ perceptions",,,,,,,,,,"Aleksandrowicz-Pędich, L., Draghicescu, J., Issaiass, D., Sabec, N., The views of teachers of English and French on intercultural communicative competence in language teaching (2003) Incorporating intercultural communicative competence in language teacher education, pp. 7-37. , Lázár I., (ed), Strasbourg: Council of Europe; Bektaş-Çetinkaya, Y., Extension of teacher knowledge: Developing the intercultural competence of pre-service foreign language teachers in Turkey (2014) Novitas-ROYAL (Research on Youth and Language), 8 (2), pp. 153-168; Bennett, J.M., Bennett, M.J., Developing intercultural sensitivity (2004) Handbook of intercultural training, pp. 147-165. , Bennett J.M., Bennett M.J., Landis D., (eds), 3rd ed., Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage; Byram, M., (1997) Teaching and assessing intercultural communicative competence, , Clevedon: Multilingual Matters; Byram, M., (2003) Intercultural competence, , Strasbourg: Council of Europe; Byram, M., Gribkova, B., Starkey, H., (2002) Developing the intercultural dimension in language teaching, , Strasbourg: Council of Europe; Castro, P., Sercu, L., Objectives of foreign language teaching and culture teaching time (2005) Foreign language teachers and intercultural competence.

These programmes aim to promote educational and labour market integration, access to Portuguese nationality, and cognitive development. This paper argues that official Portuguese learning policies have mainly targeted a population with an immigrant background that fails to represent the full range of adult immigrants’ needs. In particular, less educated adult immigrants’ educational needs have been persistently neglected. Considering that, hitherto, approximately 9% of trainees have been adult immigrants with little or no schooling, this group has not received sufficient attention in policy measures, nor has it been fully accommodated in institutional terms. As a starting point, the paper identifies the place of adult immigrant literacy in international and national discussions. Subsequently, it discusses the main official programmes offering Portuguese for Speakers of Other Languages to adult immigrants. The data from the main programmes were backed up by fieldwork, in particular interviews carried out with teachers and public officials which highlight the main barriers and strategies impacting on this group. Finally, we argue that programmes should consider tailor-made solutions, given the counterproductive heterogeneity of classes and the arbitrariness of informal procedures. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.","Adult literacy learners; immigrants with little or no schooling; language policies; literacy; Portuguese for Speakers of Other Languages",,,,,,,,,,"(2001), Programa Portugal Acolhe.

In this sense, it ultimately aims at supporting the training of intercultural speakers, capable of promoting an effective Intercultural Dialogue between the two countries. A diagnosis is presented of the reciprocal images of Portuguese and Turkish students learning each other's language and culture. Conclusions are drawn on how their self- and hetero-images may pertain on the construction of their identities, on their awareness about and attitudes towards each other, on their motivation to learn each other's language, and on intercultural communication itself. Allying the study of Images of Languages and Cultures and the concept of Intercultural Competence in the study of students’ representations within the FLE research tradition, a content analysis was carried out of the responses given to an inquiry by questionnaire. Conative implications of the students’ images as revealed in the results were pointed out. Some important distinctions are highlighted in the reciprocal images of both groups. On this basis, recommendations for FLE are made focusing on the positive reconstruction of students’ reciprocal images. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.","Foreign language education; images of languages and cultures; intercultural awareness; intercultural competence; intercultural dialogue",,,,,,"European Social Fund, ESF: SFRH/BD/ 48465/2008

However, business leaders report them to be more challenging than face-to-face ones. Most global teams are located where diverse offshored work teams are using English as a lingua franca, and despite common business complaints that they are fraught with communication breakdown, the precise causes appear to be highly complex. This paper reports on a training needs analysis carried out in a large globalized workplace for a programme entitled ‘Communicating in Virtual Teams’. Multiple sources such as surveys, interviews, document reviews and meeting observations were used to better understand the causes of virtual team communication breakdown. Whilst the analyses revealed different kinds of language and cultural misunderstandings, deeper problems of marginalization and identity confusion within global teams were also reported. This paper argues that without addressing the underlying struggles caused by offshoring, a training programme runs the risk of only addressing the surface communication problems of technology, leadership and meeting skills and even language and culture issues, which can arguably be seen as ‘masking’ deeper employee concerns and struggles. © 2015, © 2015 Taylor & Francis.","business communication; intercultural and language breakdown; virtual team meetings",,,,,,,,,,"Belcher, D., Lukkarila, L., Identity in the ESP context: Putting the learner front and center in needs analysis (2011) New directions in English for specific purposes research, pp. 73-94. , Belcher D, Johns A, Paltridge B, (eds), Ann Arbor, MI: The University of Michigan Press; Blommaert, J., Bulcaen, C., Critical discourse analysis (2000) Annual Review of Anthropology, 29, pp. 447-466; Cameron, D., (2000) Good to talk?

Four recurring ways of sharing cultural knowledge were identified as the participants managed the distribution and completion of tasks, and attended to building mutual understanding in the unfolding interaction. The findings illustrate that cultural knowledge sharing is dynamic, situational and collaborative. Rather than hindering or enhancing interaction, culture is an interactional accomplishment with fluid referents, boundaries and membership.

While oral language is frequently examined as a site for the negotiation of identity, written texts can also be studied for information about how language learners position themselves within their receiving culture. This study looks at the relationship between pronoun choice and identity in additional language academic writing by first generation immigrants in Norway, arguing that language learners signal solidarity with certain subject positions through their use of pronouns. Examining English-language texts discussing themes related to language preservation and immigration, one finds that the immigrant students in this sample are more likely to align their identifications with the receiving country, Norway, than they are to distance themselves from it. However, the texts also reveal a tendency for the students to identify with immigrants as a pan-national group, not tied to any given sending culture. This pan-immigrant identification provides the students with a recognizable community in a social landscape without a long history of multicultural integration. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.",,,,,,,,,,,"Bauman, Z., (1999) Culture as praxis, , http://sociology.sunimc.net/htmledit/uploadfile/system/20110604/20110604145228963.pdf, London: Sage, Retrieved from; Bhabha, H.K., (1994) The location of culture, , London: Routledge; Block, D., (2007) Second language identities, , London: Continuum; Bodine, A., Androcentrism in prescriptive grammar: Singular ‘they’, sex-indefinite ‘he’, and ‘he or she’ (1975) Language in Society, 4, pp. 129-146; Bosch, P., (1983) Agreement and anaphora: A study of the role of pronouns in syntax and discourse, , London: Academic Press; Brown, R., Gilman, A., (1960) The pronouns of power and solidarity, , Indianapolis, IN: Bobbs-Merrill; Bucholtz, M., Hall, K., Identity and interaction: A sociocultural linguistic approach (2005) Discourse Studies, 7, pp. 585-614; Canagarajah, A.S., (1999) Resisting linguistic imperialism in English teaching, , Oxford: Oxford University Press; Canagarajah, A.S., (2002) A geopolitics of academic writing, , Pittsburgh: University of Pittsburgh Press; Cheshire, J., Who we are and where we’re going: Language and identities in the new Europe (2002) Beyond boundaries: Language and identity in contemporary Europe, pp. 19-34. , Gubbins P., Holt M., (eds), Clevedon: Multilingual Matters; Chopra, R., (2011) Global media, culture, and identity: Theory, cases, and approaches, , New York: Routledge; Çiğdem, S.Ş., (2006) Third language acquisition: Turkish–German bilingual students' acquisition of English word order in a German educational setting, , Münster: Waxmann; Coupland, N., (2007) Style: Language variation and identity, , Cambridge: Cambridge University Press; Cummins, J., (2000) Language, power, and pedagogy: Bilingual children in the crossfire, , Clevedon: Multilingual Matters; Darvin, R., Norton, B., Transnational identity and migrant language learners: The promise of digital storytelling (2014) Education Matters, 2 (1), p. 55; Darvin, R., Norton, B., Identity and a model of investment in applied linguistics (2015) Annual Review of Applied Linguistics, 35, pp. 36-56; Deschamps, J., Social identity and relations of power between groups (2010) Social identity and intergroup relations, pp. 85-98. , Tajfel H., (ed), New York: Cambridge University Press; Fina, A.D., Pronominal choice, identity, and solidarity in political discourse (1995) Text–Interdisciplinary Journal for the Study of Discourse, 15, pp. 379-410; Hyland, K., Authority and invisibility (2002) Journal of Pragmatics, 34, pp. 1091-1112; Ivanič, R., (1998) Writing and identity: The discoursal construction of identity in academic writing, , Amsterdam: John Benjamins; Kashima, E.S., Kashima, Y., Culture and language: The case of cultural dimensions and personal pronoun use (1998) Journal of Cross-Cultural Psychology, 29, pp. 461-486; Kitagawa, C., Lehrer, A., Impersonal uses of personal pronouns (1990) Journal of Pragmatics, 14, pp. 739-759; Labov, W., (1972) Language in the inner city: Studies in the Black English vernacular, , Philadelphia:: University of Pennsylvania Press; Lave, J., Wenger, E., (1991) Situated learning: Legitimate peripheral participation, , Cambridge: Cambridge University Press; Lysvåg, P., (2005) A text-based resource book from increased awareness to improved writing, , Kristiansand: Høyskoleforlaget; MacKay, D., Prescriptive grammar and the pronoun problem (1983) Language, gender and society, pp. 38-53. , Thorne B., Kramarae C., Henley N., (eds), Rowley, MA: Newbury House; Miller, E., Kubota, R., Second language identity construction (2013) The Cambridge handbook of second language acquisition, pp. 230-250. , Herschensohn J., Young-Scholten M., (eds), New York, NY: Cambridge University Press; Mühlhäusler, P., Harré, R., (1990) Pronouns and people: The linguistic construction of social and personal identity, , Oxford: B.

It discusses the challenges of sensitizing students of business communication to the real or imagined connectivities that bind individuals and societies together, and the ethical responsibilities and dilemmas that follow. It shows how language courses that focus on culture and the ownership of English provide fertile grounds on which to rearrange students’ prior knowledge and perceptions of distant people in distant places in new formations. The result of the afterthought is twofold. First, it claims that the sensation of vulnerability that surface in learning contexts, with its paradoxical potential to harm on the one hand and to be productive and generative on the other, can be a key experiential element in provoking movements in perspectives. Second, by privileging the notion of ‘rooted’ cosmopolitanism, it claims that the tasks and responsibilities related to the cultivation of cosmopolitan sensitivities are ethical issues shared by student and teacher. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.","cosmopolitanism; Global Englishes; intercultural learning; internationalization; vulnerability",,,,,,,,,,"Agar, M., Text and fieldwork: Exploring the excluded middle (1990) Journal of Contemporary Ethnography, 19 (1), pp. 73-88; Appiah, K.A., (2006) Cosmopolitanism: Ethics in a world of strangers, , London: Penguin; Beck, U., Sznaider, N., Unpacking cosmopolitanism for the social sciences: A research agenda (2006) The British Journal of Sociology, 57 (1), pp. 1-23; Bell, S., Self-reflection and vulnerability in action research: Bringing forth new worlds in our learning (1998) Systemic Practice and Action Research, 11, pp. 179-191; Bhabha, H., Unsatisfied: Notes on vernacular cosmopolitanism (1996) Text and nation, pp. 191-207. , Garcia-Morena L., Pfeifer P.C., (eds), London: Camden House; Blasco, M., Cultural pragmatists?

Although this argument is mentioned frequently in promotional materials for study abroad, it has not yet been backed by research based on the outcomes of students’ study abroad experiences. As more students’ study abroad and study abroad programing becomes shorter, it is more important than ever to test the claims made by program organizers. The present mixed-methods study examined 12 students’ development in intercultural sensitivity over the period of a four-week study abroad program in Salamanca, Spain. Findings demonstrate that students made little changes in intercultural sensitivity as measured by the Intercultural Sensitivity Index and as reported in the qualitative data; however, these methods produced conflicting findings on students’ stages of intercultural sensitivity development. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.","immersion; intercultural awareness; intercultural learning; second language learning; study abroad",,,,,,,,,,"Allen, H.W., Dristas, V., Mills, N., Cultural learning outcomes and summer study abroad (2007) Identity and second language learning: Culture, inquiry, and dialogic activity in educational contexts, pp. 189-215. , Mantero M., (ed), Greenwich, CT: Information Age; Bachner, D., Zeutschel, U., Long-term effects of international educational youth exchange (2009) Intercultural Education, 20 (sup1), pp. 45-58; Bennett, M.J., Towards ethnorelativism: A developmental model of intercultural sensitivity (1993) Education for the intercultural experience, pp. 109-135. , Paige R.M., (ed), Yarmouth, ME: Intercultural Press; Bennett, M.J., Paradigmatic assumptions and a developmental approach to intercultural learning (2012) Student learning abroad, pp. 90-114. , Vande Berg M., Paige R.M., Lou K.H., (eds), Sterling, VA: Stylus; Chieffo, L., Griffiths, L., Large-scale assessment of student attitudes after a short-term study abroad program (2004) Frontiers: The Interdisciplinary Journal of Study Abroad, 10, pp. 165-177. , http://www.frontiersjournal.com/index.htm, Retrieved from; Clark, I., Flaherty, T.B., Wright, N.D., McMillen, R.M., Student intercultural proficiency from study abroad programs (2009) Journal of Marketing Education, 31, pp. 173-181; Cushner, K., (1986) Human diversity in action: Developing multicultural competencies for the classroom, , 2nd ed., New York, NY: McGraw-Hill; Dwyer, M.M., More is better: The impact of study abroad program duration (2004) Frontiers: The Interdisciplinary Journal of Study Abroad, 10, pp. 151-163. , http://www.frontiersjournal.com/index.htm, Retrieved from; Engle, L., Engle, J., Assessing language acquisition and intercultural sensitivity development in relation to study abroad design (2004) Frontiers: The Interdisciplinary Journal of Study Abroad, 10, pp. 219-236. , http://www.frontiersjournal.com/index.htm, Retrieved from; Engle, L., Engle, J., Beyond immersion: The American University Center of Provence experiment and holistic intervention (2012) Student learning abroad, pp. 284-307. , Vande Berg M., Paige R.M., Lou K.H., (eds), Sterling, VA: Stylus; George, A., Study abroad in central Spain: The development of regional phonological features (2014) Foreign Language Annals, 47, pp. 97-114; Godfrey, L., Treacy, C., Tarone, E., Change in French second language writing in study abroad and domestic contexts (2014) Foreign Language Annals, 47, pp. 48-65; Hammer, M.R., Additional cross-cultural validity testing of the intercultural development inventory (2011) International Journal of Intercultural Relations, 35, pp. 474-487; Hammer, M.R., The intercultural development inventory: A new frontier in assessment and development of intercultural competence (2012) Student learning abroad, pp. 115-136. , Vande Berg M., Paige R.M., Lou K.H., (eds), Sterling, VA: Stylus; Hammer, M.R., Bennett, M.J., (2001) The Intercultural Development Inventory (IDI) manual, , Portland, OR: Intercultural Communication Institute; (2014), http://www.iie.org/opendoors, “Duration of U.S. Study Abroad, 2000/01-2012/13.” Open Doors Report on International Educational Exchange.

This paper explores the sentiment of high school students who were born and raised in Australia towards issues of language and migration, including the need for migrants to speak English and use Australian dialect and accent. Results show that Australian youth have diverse and sophisticated understandings of what is a complex and often polarising issue of public debate. While public multicultural backlash discourse may be influencing some students who support the idea that migrants should learn English before coming to Australia, many students believe that individual circumstances should be considered when evaluating migrant language issues. Student views about migrants' use of Australian dialect and accent also vary but these responses include less mitigation than to those about migrants' English language abilities, suggesting that the role of English is more contested than the role of dialect and accent. We close by reflecting on the design of our data instruments for eliciting opinions in this controversial area and what our findings might mean for future Australian discourse on language, migration and belonging. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.","adolescents; Australian language policy; integration; language ideologies; Migration",,,,,,,,,,"Archakis, A., Immigrant voices in students’ essay texts: Between assimilation and pride (2014) Discourse & Society, 25 (3), pp. 297-314; Baumgarten, N., House, J., I think and I don't know in English as lingua franca and native English discourse (2010) Journal of Pragmatics, 42 (5), pp. 1184-1200; Blommaert, J., Citizenship, language, and superdiversity: Towards complexity (2013) Journal of Language, Identity & Education, 12 (3), pp. 193-196; Blommaert, J., Verschueren, J., (1998) Debating diversity: Analysing the discourse of tolerance, , London: Routledge; Bonilla-Silva, E., Forman, T.A., ‘I am not a racist but … ’: Mapping White college students’ racial ideology in the USA (2000) Discourse & Society, 11 (1), pp. 50-85; Boomgaarden, H.G., Vliegenthart, R., How news content influences anti-immigration attitudes: Germany, 1993–2005 (2009) European Journal of Political Research, 48 (4), pp. 516-542; Canagarajah, S., Agency and power in intercultural communication: Negotiating English in translocal spaces (2013) Language and Intercultural Communication, 13 (2), pp. 202-224; Castles, S., Davidson, A., (2000) Citizenship and migration: Globalization and the politics of belonging, , New York: Routledge; Chambers, J.K., Dialect acquisition (1992) Language, 68 (4), pp. 673-705; Condor, S., Temporality and collectivity: Diversity, history and the rhetorical construction of national entitativity (2006) British Journal of Social Psychology, 45 (4), pp. 657-682; Creese, G., Erasing English language competency: African migrants in Vancouver, Canada (2010) Journal of International Migration and Integration/Revue de L'integration et de La Migration Internationale, 11 (3), pp. 295-313; Eberhardt, M., Enregisterment of Pittsburghese and the local African American community (2012) Language & Communication, 32 (4), pp. 358-371; Extra, G., Spotti, M., Testing regimes for newcomers to the Netherlands (2009) Language testing, migration and citizenship: Cross-national perspectives on integration regimes, pp. 125-147. , Extra G., Spotti M., van Avermaet P., (eds), London: Continnum; Gal, S., Irvine, J., The boundaries of languages and disciplines: How ideologies construct difference (1995) Social Research, 62 (4), pp. 967-1001; Gluszek, A., Dovidio, J.F., The way they speak: A social psychological perspective on the stigma of nonnative accents in communication (2010) Personality and Social Psychology Review, 14 (2), pp. 214-237; Harris, A., (2013) Young people and everyday multiculturalism, , New York, NY: Routledge; Harrison, G., ‘Oh, you've got such a strong accent’: Language identity intersecting with professional identity in the human services in Australia (2013) International Migration, 51 (5), pp. 192-204; Harwood, J., Giles, H., Bourhis, R.Y., The genesis of vitality theory: Historical patterns and discoursal dimensions (1994) International Journal of the Sociology of Language, 108, pp. 167-206; Hatoss, A., van Rensburg, H., Starks, D., Finding one's own linguistic space: Views on English, Afrikaans and identity in a semi-urban Australian context (2011) Sociolinguistic Studies, 5 (2), pp. 257-289; Hogan-Brun, G., Mar-Molinero, C., Stevenson, P., (2009) Discourse on language and integration: Critical perspectives on language testing regimes in Europe, , Amsterdam: John Benjamins; Hornberger, N., Wang, S., Who are our heritage language learners?

Examining teacher recruitment materials and promotional materials of 52 English camps, this paper explores how intercultural communicative competence and global citizenship relate to and interact with each other and how these concepts are implicated in Korean English immersion education. The paper further examines what these English camps promise and deliver in terms of preparing English learners for global citizenship via English education. Viewing the cultivation of criticality at the heart of the development of intercultural communicative competence and the shaping of global citizens, the paper argues the need to revisit the concept of criticality in language teaching and learning, familiarize teachers, and students with the practice of criticality, and as a result, raise their critical awareness of the world. Thus, criticality with its emphasis on overcoming stereotypes, relating to and understanding otherness, and gaining a deeper understanding of one's own cultural values could better prepare our learners for the globalized era. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.","Criticality; EFL learners; English immersion camps; global citizenship; intercultural communicative competence",,,,,,"Hankuk University of Foreign Studies, HUFS",,,,"Alptekin, C., Towards intercultural communicative competence in ELT (2002) ELT Journal, 56 (1), pp. 57-64; Ashwill, M.A., Oanh, D.T.H., Developing globally competent citizens: The contrasting cases of the United States and Vietnam (2009) The SAGE handbook of intercultural competence, pp. 141-157. , Deardorff D.K., (ed), Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage; Bae, H.J., IIE to help expand TaLK language exchange program (2011) The Korea Herald, , http://www.koreaherald.com/national/Detail.jsp?newsMLId=20110501000211, May 1, Retrieved from; Banks, J.A., (2003) Diversity and citizenship education: Global perspectives, , San Francisco, CA: Jossey-Bass; Byram, M., (1997) Teaching and assessing intercultural communicative competence, , Clevedon: Multilingual Matters; Byram, M., Language awareness and (critical) cultural awareness – Relationships, comparisons and contrasts (2012) Language Awareness, 21, pp. 5-13; Cheng, L., English immersion schools in China: Evidence from students and teachers (2012) Journal of Multilingual and Multicultural Development, 33, pp. 379-391; Clark, R., Fairclough, N., Ivanicˇ, R., Martin-Jones, M., Critical language awareness part I: A critical review of three current approaches to language awareness (1990) Language and Education, 4, pp. 249-260; Clark, R., Fairclough, N., Ivanicˇ, R., Martin-Jones, M., Critical language awareness part II: A critical review of three current approaches to language awareness (1991) Language and Education, 5, pp. 41-54; Cook, V.J., Linguistic relativity and language teaching (2011) Language and bilingual cognition, pp. 509-518. , Cook V.J., Bassetti B., (eds), New York, NY: Psychology Press; Davies, I., Pike, G., Global citizenship education: Challenges and possibilities (2009) The handbook of practice and research in study abroad: Higher education and the quest for global citizenship, pp. 61-77. , Lewin R., (ed), New York, NY: Routledge; Downes, S., Sense of Japanese cultural identity within an English partial immersion programme: Should parents worry?

Sources of data included think aloud protocols, semi-structured interviews and participant written responses. Qualitative data analysis revealed how the participants’ multiple identities at individual and group levels prominently emerged as they constructed a storyline that was internally and externally coherent. Based on the findings, we propose that the concept of the ‘L2 reader identity’ is useful for capturing the intricacies of the identity work of readers who construct meanings at the intersection of languages and cultures. The study concludes that the reading processes that L2 readers engage in are not only the site of their multiple identities at work, but also a site where multiple competing concepts of the world meet, clash, transform and coexist resulting in narratives that cross cultures, contexts and individuals. Limitations and implications of the study for L2 research and pedagogy are discussed. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.","culture; identity; Korean; L2 reading; literature; reading comprehension",,,,,,,,,,"Anderson, R.C., Pearson, P.D., A schema-theoretic view of basic processes in reading comprehension (1984) Handbook of reading research, pp. 255-292. , Pearson P.D., (ed), New York: Longman;

The paper presents a study conducted in two women's health assistance centres in an Italian province, and is based on seven hours of audiotaped and transcribed interactions between midwives and migrant patients during prenatal check-ups. The analysis concerns those actions in which the midwives (1) formulate patients’ previous utterances in order to check their own understanding and then provide explanations or continue their inquiry, and (2) reformulate their own utterances in order to solve explicit or expected problems of understanding on the part of patients. The paper illustrates how formulations and reformulations are used by midwives to try to overcome language barriers in healthcare interactions and give meanings to medical terms and patients’ health problems. The analysis shows that formulations and reformulations can enhance both a patient-centred form of communication and a form of midwives’ authority, discussing how these forms establish conditions and meanings of intercultural communication.

Particular attention is paid to open-air museums that preserve old buildings and areas reminiscent of the colonial past. The analysis will rely on the concept of ‘knower,’ a term referring to those in charge of selecting and arranging the information that accompanies the exhibits, and ‘propaganda,’ as used by Stanard in his study of the official discourse used to justify the Belgian empire.

The study is based on two main issues: the linguistic and cultural diversity of Hispanics, and the specialized nature of the health and judicial systems. When encountering new or different health care and judicial systems in the USA, Hispanics often code-switch or borrow terms from English that are more practical for the context, and transfer them to their dominant language. This process creates a unique, non-standard or hybrid form of Spanish that challenges translators and interpreters, whose aim is to facilitate communication between L1 and L2. As qualified individuals trained to use language professionally, they must decide whether to use non-standard language in the pursuit of their communicative goal. The data from observation and interviews with interpreters, as well as the analysis of translations containing speech forms prone to non-standard use, point in the direction of a response based on constraints imposed by the nature of the contexts and ethical and professional guidelines, and not by lack of knowledge or access to lexicon, as some prior studies have proposed. The findings also show that translators and interpreters consciously follow a course of action, which may include educating the target audience by virtue of their choices. This is a deviation from their role as language brokers. © 2015, © 2015 Taylor & Francis.",,,,,,,,,,,"Anderson, R.B., Perspectives on the role of interpreter (2002) The interpreting studies reader, pp. 208-217. , Pöchhacker F., Shlesinger M., (eds), London: Routledge; Berg-Seligson, S., (2002) The bilingual courtroom.

To that end, I will examine the definitions of this cultural and linguistic phenomenon, make a necessary distinction among the different language contact phenomena that take place in a bilingual context such as the Spanish and English background in the USA, and evaluate some of the most popular and influential approaches that have come out in the codeswitching literature over the last 30 years. These approaches can be broadly classified into two groups: first, those that are essentially descriptive or constraint-based, and second, the studies that are explanatory or constraint-free. Finally, I conclude that although there seems to be no definitive, universal model of codeswitching, formal linguistics research has comprehensively shown that codeswitching requires a strong command of the two languages and that it is not an unstructured phenomenon. This constitutes a sharp contrast with the relationship commonly established between Spanglish and illiteracy, marginality and chaos. This language choice simply reveals how bilinguals live in between two languages and two cultures. © 2015, © 2015 Taylor & Francis.","English; intrasentential codeswitching; Spanish; syntactic constraints",,,,,,,,,,"Abney, S.P., (1987) The English noun phrase in its sentential aspect(Unpublished doctoral dissertation, , MIT: Cambridge, MA; Aguirre, S.P., (1976) Acceptability judgements of code-switching phrases by Chicanos: Some preliminary findings, , Report No. ED129122, Springfield, VA: ERIC; Appel, R., Muysken, P., (1996) Bilingüismo y contacto de lenguas, , Barcelona: Ariel; Belazi, H., Rubin, E., Toribio, J., Code switching and X-bar theory: The functional head constraint (1994) Linguistic Inquiry, 25, pp. 221-237; Blom, J.-P., Gumperz, J., Social meaning in linguistic structure: Codeswitching in Norway (1972) Directions in sociolinguistics, pp. 407-434. , Gumperz J, Hymes D, (eds), New York, NY: Holt, Rinehart and Winston; Cantone, K.F., Evidence against a third grammar: Code-switching in Italian-German bilingual children (2005) ISB4: Proceedings of the 4th international symposium on bilingualism, pp. 477-496. , Cohen J, McAlister K.

The intimate nexus between the Island's political status and issues of language was highlighted during that time not only in the news media on the Island but also in the US presidential campaign speeches during which candidates divulged their perspectives. This paper analyzes metaphors on language in Puerto Rico, including, among others, those based on el engañol or el cuco, particularly where these appeared in connection with the plebiscite on status, focusing on news articles and opinion columns published between December 2011 and April 2013, from the time the plebiscite was announced through the follow-up coverage several months after it was held. The paper concludes that the debates on language as related to status in Puerto Rico maintain some well-known metaphors, but that other, third-way metaphorical expressions are also being used to clarify and give shape to the controversy. © 2015, © 2015 Taylor & Francis.","English;

In addition to expressing both perspectives directly through overt language, the instructor also represented them through indirect representation of stances toward the context, toward ways of using language, and toward other speakers. She did this by moving in and out of her language teacher role and thus constructing different social contexts in the classroom, by displaying positive and negative affective stances toward features of local varieties of Spanish, and by constructing stances of authority based on knowledge of ‘correct’ Spanish in some moments, and based on her own experiences as a bilingual in others. The study findings contribute to an understanding of the role of US educational institutions in the construction of ideologies about Spanish and provide information that can be used to improve HL instruction. © 2015, © 2015 Taylor & Francis.","heritage language education; language ideologies; Spanish; stance; USA",,,,,,,,,,"Abdi, K., ‘She really only speaks English’: Positioning, language ideology, and heritage language learners (2011) Canadian Modern Language Review, 67, pp. 161-190; Auer, P., (1984) Bilingual conversation, , Amsterdam: John Benjamins; Beaudrie, S., Ducar, C., Potowski, K., (2014) Heritage language teaching: Research and practice, , Columbus, OH: McGraw-Hill Education; Bucholtz, M., Hal, K., Language and identity (2004) The Handbook of Linguistic Anthropology, pp. 369-394. , Duranti A., (ed), Malden, MA and Oxford: Blackwell; Cameron, D., (1995) Verbal hygiene, , London: Routledge; Coles-Ritchie, M., Lugo, J., Implementing a Spanish for heritage speakers course in an English-only state: A collaborative critical teacher action research study (2010) Educational Action Research, 18, pp. 197-212; Del Valle, J., The politics of normativity and globalization: Which Spanish in the classroom?

In the first study, it was established that Spanish-language newspapers reflected an intercultural dialogue among different Latino groups, thus creating a pan-Hispanic identity. In this article we wish to go a step further and explore whether the Spanish-language newspapers may also reflect, and foster, a second level of intercultural dialogue between the Hispanic and the non-Hispanic communities. In order to carry out this research, a qualitative content analysis approach will be used to study a corpus of issues in two newspapers, El Diario-La Prensa and Hoy. By close reading and observation of the different elements present in them, both textual and visual, we will extract the most relevant aspects and give some examples to show that this second level is present in the media analysed. © 2015, © 2015 Taylor & Francis.","Hispanic press; intercultural communication; intercultural dialogue; New York press; pan-Hispanic identity",,,,,,,,,,"Beltran, C., (2010) The trouble with unity.

The question is: What precise aspects of intercultural competence do CIEs help learners build? This article introduces an open-ended variety of CIE called an ‘encounter exercise,’ and explores the aspects of intercultural competence regular use of such exercises helps learners build. Drawing on recent literature about dual-process views of thinking, this article argues that encounter exercises are valuable for helping learners build the following habits of thought: (1) being consciously aware of the interpretation process in intercultural communication situations, (2) consciously considering multiple interpretations of puzzling or problematic intercultural encounters, (3) paying conscious attention to factors that may affect how one interprets problematic intercultural encounters, especially factors that affect feelings or interpretation rules, and (4) paying conscious attention to the ‘benefit-of-the-doubt’ question. © 2015, © 2015 Taylor & Francis.","critical incident exercises; dual-process thinking; intercultural communication; intercultural competence; interpretation",,,,,,,,,,"Albert, R., The intercultural sensitizer/culture assimilator as a cross-cultural training method (1995) Intercultural sourcebook, 1, pp. 157-167. , Fowler S., Mumford M., (eds), Yarmouth: Intercultural Press; Apedaile, S., Schill, L., (2008) Critical incidents for intercultural communication: An interactive tool for developing awareness, knowledge, and skills, , http://www.norquest.ca/NorquestCollege/media/pdf/centres/intercultural/CriticalIncidentsBooklet.pdf, Retrieved from; Brewer, M., (2003) Intergroup relations, , 2nd ed, Buckingham: Open University Press; Brewer, M., Miller, N., (1996) Intergroup relations, , Pacific Grove, CA: Brooks/Cole Publishing; Brislin, R., (1993) Understanding culture's influence on behavior, , San Diego, CA: Harcourt Brace; Brislin, R., Yoshida, T., (1994) Intercultural communication training: An introduction, , Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage; Corbett, J., (2003) An intercultural approach to English language teaching, , Clevedon: Multilingual Matters; Cushner, K., Brislin, R., (1996) Intercultural interactions: A practical guide, , 2nd ed, Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage; Cushner, K., Landis, D., The intercultural sensitizer (1996) Handbook of intercultural training, pp. 185-202. , Landis D., Bhagat R., (eds), 2nd ed, Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage; Dai, F., Smith, S., (2003) Cultures in contrast, , Shanghai: Shanghai Foreign Language Education Press; Evans, J.S.B.T., Stanovich, K.E., Dual-process theories of higher cognition: Advancing the debate (2013) Perspectives on Psychological Science, 8, pp. 223-241; Fowler, S.M., Blohm, J.M., An analysis of methods for intercultural training (2004) Handbook of intercultural training, pp. 37-84. , Landis D., Bennett J., Bennett M., (eds), Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage; Gudykunst, W., Kim, Y.Y., (1997) Communicating with strangers, , 3rd ed, Boston, MA: McGraw-Hill; Kahneman, D., (2011) Thinking, fast and slow, , New York, NY: Farrar, Straus, & Giroux; Levine, D., Baxter, J., McNulty, P., (1987) The culture puzzle, , Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice Hall; Murphy, A., (1991) Cultural encounters in the USA, , Lincolnwood, IL: National Textbook Company; Portnoy, F., (2012) Wait: The art and science of delay, , New York, NY: Public Affairs; Scollon, R., Scollon, S., (1995) Intercultural communication, , Oxford: Blackwell; Snow, D., (2014) Encounters with westerners, , Rev. ed, Shanghai: Shanghai Foreign Language Education Press, 1st ed. 2004; Spitzberg, B., Changnon, G., Conceptualizing intercultural competence (2009) The Sage handbook of intercultural competence, pp. 2-52. , Deardorff D., (ed), Los Angeles, CA: Sage; Triandis, H., (1995) Individualism and collectivism, , Boulder, CO: Westview Press; Wang, M., Brislin, R., Wang, W.Z., Williams, D., Chao, J., (2000) Turning bricks into jade, , Yarmouth: Intercultural Press; Ward, C., Bochner, S., Furnham, A., (2001) The psychology of culture shock, , London: Routledge; Wight, A., The critical incident as a training tool (1995) Intercultural sourcebook, 1, pp. 127-140. , Fowler S., Mumford M., (eds), Yarmouth: Intercultural Press; Wilson, T., (2002) Strangers to ourselves: Discovering the adaptive unconscious, , Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press","Snow, D.; Language and Writing Programs, Duke Kunshan UniversityChina",,,"Routledge",,,,,14708477,,,,"English","Lang.

Drawing on data collected through in-depth case studies with migrant Polish children and their parents, we explore the influence of intergenerationality on children's cultural practices, values and sense of identity and the significant forms of learning that take place within transnational families. Prompted by the diverse influences on their cultural learning after migration – from statutory services, community organisations, media, peers and family across two countries – children's beliefs about the cultural values they should adopt are constantly under pressure and transformation. Using a sociocultural approach, we examine migrant children's and their parents' positions, and describe these as convergent or divergent in terms of cultural values and practices. We highlight the key role of children's agency in the processes of intergenerational learning and relations and argue that transnational intergenerationalities need to be understood as reconfigured by the new spatiality of family migration and require a more complex relational analysis, in order to inform inclusive practices in schools and community-based initiatives. © 2015, © 2015 Taylor & Francis.","cultural values; intergenerational learning; migrant children; minority languages; transnationalism",,,,,,,,,,"Aarsand, P.A., Computer and video games in family life: The digital divide as a resource in intergenerational interactions (2007) Childhood, 14, pp. 235-256; Ager, A., Strang, A., Understanding integration: A conceptual framework (2008) Journal of Refugee Studies, 21, pp. 166-191; Anthias, F., Thinking through the lens of translocational positionality: An intersectionality frame for understanding identity and belonging (2008) Translocations, 4 (1), pp. 5-20; Anthias, F., Intersections and translocations: New paradigms for thinking about cultural diversity and social identities (2011) European Educational Research Journal, 10, pp. 204-217; Appadurai, A., Disjuncture and difference in the global cultural economy (1990) Theory, Culture & Society, 7, pp. 295-310; Attias-Donfut, C., Segalen, M., The construction of grandparenthood (2002) Current Sociology, 50, pp. 281-294; Bauman, Z., (2000) Liquid modernity, , Cambridge: Polity Press; Boyatzis, R., (1998) Transforming qualitative information: Thematic analysis and code development, , London: Sage; Bushin, N., Interviewing with children in their homes: Putting ethical principles into practice and developing flexible techniques (2007) Children’s Geographies, 5, pp. 235-251; Castles, S., De Haas, H., Miller, M., (2013) The age of migration: International population movements in the modern world, , 5th ed, Hampshire: Palgrave Macmillan; Chaudhary, N., Persistent patterns in cultural negotiations of the Self: Using dialogical Self theory to understand self-other dynamics within culture (2008) International Journal for Dialogical Science, 3 (1), pp. 9-30; Chuang, S.S., Moreno, R., (2011) Immigrant children: Change, adaptation, and cultural transformation, , Lanham, MD: Lexington Books; Cole, M., (1996) Cultural psychology: A once and future discipline, , Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press; Gadsden, V.L., Simmons, M., (1996) Intergenerational learning: A review of literature., , National Centre for Fathers and Families, Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania; Gregory, E., Sisters and brothers as language and literacy teachers: Synergy between siblings playing and working together (2001) Journal of Early Childhood Literacy, 1, pp. 301-322; Grewal, I., Ritchie, J., Ethnic and language matching of the researcher and the research group during design, fieldwork and analysis (2006) Health and social research in multiethnic societies, pp. 65-82. , Nazroo J.

In unstructured interviews or ‘conversations,’ migrants share narratives about the type of communication they do at work, communication challenges, what they perceive as strengths and weaknesses/easy or difficult communication, and what profession they held when in Mexico. In addition, they provide insight into their feelings about the current state of the immigration in the United States, how much they know about the immigration debates, and how this might impact how they communicate at work.

In light of this issue, this paper addresses the Damunwha students' identities and participation within the language communities from a community of practice perspective and a critical pedagogy perspective. Four students (two from international marriage families and two from immigrant workers' families), their teachers, and their supervisors participated in the study from March to April 2013. The findings suggest that Damunwha students' participation in Korean society depends on their resources, others' perception of the participants' identities, and cultural capital. The findings show that students are losing their connection with their first language communities and that their linguistic resources and cultural diversity are undervalued. The study implies that cultural sensitivity should be promoted and that explicit support for Damunwha students is needed. © 2015, © 2015 Taylor & Francis.","cultural minorities; cultural pedagogy; identity; intercultural awareness; language policy; multiculturalism",,,,,,,,,,"An, E.-M., (2007) Study on factors effecting school adjustment of children from international marriages in the rural areas, , Unpublished master's thesis, Ewha Women's University, Seoul, Korea:; (2007) Matitneun gukjeihaegyoyook, , Seoul, Korea: Ilchokak; (2009) Damunwhasahoewa gukjeihaegyoyuk, , Paju, Korea: Dongnyok; Bourdieu, P., The forms of capital (1986) Readings in economic sociology, pp. 280-291. , Biggart N.

Standardized English language use is prioritized as a value-added skill, over contextualized or localized language use as authentic language ability, in these contexts which are natural sites of intercultural communication in multilingual, multiethnic Malaysia. It is contended that standardized English may not be able to compete with the authenticity of contextualized or localized language use for it is the latter that ensures that the work of the localized workplace gets done first before it can lay claim to the globalized economy. The tension between such authentic language use as innate ability and prescribed language use as skills can impinge on intercultural communication competence (ICC). Three studies that demonstrate such tension in the localized Malaysian and globalized business contexts are discussed following an examination of ICC in Anglo-American contexts. © 2015, © 2015 Taylor & Francis.","contextualized language use; English; intercultural communication competence; Malaysia",,,,,,,,,,"Arasaratnam, L.A., Research in intercultural communication competence: Past perspectives and future directions (2007) Journal of International Communication, 13 (2), pp. 66-73; Arasaratnam, L.A., The development of a new instrument of intercultural communication competence (2009) Journal of Intercultural Communication, 20. , http://www.immi.se/intercultural/, Retrieved from; Arasaratnam, L.A., Doerfel, M.L., Intercultural communication competence: Identifying key components from multicultural perspectives (2005) International Journal of Intercultural Relations, 29, pp. 137-163; Asante, M.K., Miike, Y., Yin, J., (2014) The global intercultural communication reader, , New York: Routledge; Bachman, L., (1990) Fundamental considerations in language testing, , Oxford: Oxford University Press; Bargiela, F., Language at work: The first ten years (2005) ESP Across Cultures, 1, pp. 22-34; Baumann, G., (1996) Contesting culture, , Cambridge: Cambridge University Press; Block, D., The structure and agency dilemma in identity and intercultural communication research (2013) Language and Intercultural Communication, 13 (2), pp. 126-147; Byram, M., (1997) Teaching and assessing intercultural communicative competence, , Clevedon: Multilingual Matters; Canagarajah, S., (1999) Resisting linguistic imperialism in English teaching, , Oxford: Oxford University Press; Canale, M., Swain, M., (1980) Theoretical bases of communicative approaches to second language teaching and testing, , Cambridge: Cambridge University Press; Clyne, M.G., (1994) Intercultural communication at work: Cultural values in discourse, , Cambridge: Cambridge University Press; Crosling, G., Ward, I., Oral communication: The workplace needs and uses of business graduate employees (2002) English for Specific Purposes, 21 (1), pp. 41-57; Dahl, S., (2003) An overview of intercultural research, society for intercultural training and research UK I/10 (2/2003), , www.unice.fr/../_dahal%20-%20overview-of-intercultural-research.pdf, Retrieved from; Deardorff, D.K., Identification and assessment of intercultural competence as a student outcome of internationalization (2006) Journal of Studies in International Education, 10, pp. 241-266; Dervin, F., Kuoppala, K., Developing a portfolio of intercultural competences in teacher education: The case of a Finnish international programme Scandinavian Journal of Educational Research, , in press; Dervin, F., Paatela-Nieminen, M., Kuoppala, K., Riitaoja, A.-L., Multicultural education in Finland – Renewed intercultural competences to the rescue?

A qualitative case study of a Malaysian airline company was conducted to provide an analytic description of the features of linguistic proficiency and their use in the multilingual glocal workplace. Using emails, interviews and field observations, the findings point to a pluralistic view of linguistic proficiency that embraces functional business English, Malaysian English, English as a lingua franca and the use of other language codes. While the English language is shown to be dominant in the workplace, the data demonstrate the importance of a pluralistic view of linguistic proficiency in diverse glocal contexts. The study also provides insights into how language pedagogy in higher education can support diversity in the workplace. © 2015, © 2015 Taylor & Francis.","ELF; language use; linguistic proficiency; Malaysian English; multilingualism; workplace",,,,,,,,,,"Ahdoot, J., (2007) Email overload: Information overload and other negative effects of email communication, , Unpublished master's thesis, California State University; Kirkpatrick, A., Lixun, W., Patkin, J., Subhan, S., (2009) The Asian Corpus of English, , http://corpus.ied.edu.hk/ace/About.html, Retrieved from; Barton, D., Hamilton, D., (2012) Local literacies: Reading and writing in one community, , London: Routledge; Baskaran, L., The Malaysian English Mosaic (1994) English Today, 10 (1), pp. 27-32; Chan, S.H., Abdullah, A.N., Norms of language choice and use in relation to listening and speaking: The realities of the practice in the Malaysian banking sector (2013) Pertanika Journal of Social Sciences & Humanities, 21 (S), pp. 117-130; Cogo, A., English as a lingua franca: Form follows function (2008) English Today, 24 (3), pp. 58-61; Cope, B., Kalantzis, M., Introduction: Multiliteracies – the beginnings of an idea (2000) Multiliteracies: Literacy learning and the design of social futures, pp. 3-8. , Cope B, Kalantzis M, (eds), London: Routledge; Cope, B., Kalantzis, M., Multiliteracies”: New literacies, new learning (2009) Pedagogies: An International Journal, 4, pp. 164-195; Creswell, J.W., (2008) Educational research – Planning, conducting, and evaluating quantitative and qualitative research, , 3rd ed., Upper Saddle River, NJ: Pearson International Edition; DeKay, S.H., Designing email messages for corporate readers: A case study of effective and ineffective rhetorical strategies at a Fortune 100 company (2010) Business Communication Quarterly, 73 (1), pp. 109-119; Denzin, N.K., Lincoln, Y.S., Introduction: The discipline and practice of qualitative research (2003) The landscape of qualitative research: Theories and issues, pp. 1-45. , Denzin N.

As a case study and illustration of urban development workplace discourse from out of a Chinese/Asian/developing-world context, the present article examines the properties, problems, and potentials of the global branding practice of Hangzhou, a renowned tourist and ancient capital city on the east coastal region of China. First, after critiquing tendencies in relevant communication approaches, the paper outlines a holistic, cultural concept of urban branding of the developing world – as a culturally saturated, development-oriented, workplace discourse. Then, based on ethnographic data collected from a plethora of sites and sources (the municipality, trade association, the Internet, interviews, newspapers, street posters, museums, and historical records), the paper studies, qualitatively and quantitatively, a variety of interlocking international branding practices (municipal management, expos, festivals, exhibitions, international tours, websites, foreign language use, award-winning, etc.). In conclusion, the paper draws implications for future research and practice on urban development and branding in the developing world. © 2015, © 2015 Taylor & Francis.","discourse; intercultural; mega-events; urban development; workplace",,,,,,"11YJA740075","Support for the present research by the Humanities and Social Sciences Fund of the Ministry of Education [grant no.11YJA740075] is gratefully acknowledged.

Universities have been actively courting these students, sometimes without regard to their impact on responsibilities of heads of department, secretaries and support staff. Much is written on the intercultural aspects of the international teaching and learning environment, but almost nothing has appeared on the impact of international students on the university work environment, so it is necessary and opportune to discover what is being done, where problems lie and what could be improved. Based on a survey of lecturers and frontline administrative staff, this paper explores workplace perceptions of different cultural discourses, intercultural practices and relations among international students, academics and administrative staff in two universities in Canada and Denmark chosen to explore differences between Europe and North America. For the most part, academics and support staff all think that internationalization has brought many benefits to the university: intercultural diversity and awareness, strong work ethic and study habits, intellectual curiosity and a more interesting social environment. They also note problems of proficiency in English, culture clashes inside and outside the classroom and higher dropout rates, depression and anxiety. © 2015, © 2015 Taylor & Francis.","culture of participation; English proficiency concerns; faculty and staff perceptions; multicultural challenges",,,,,,,,,,"Cortazzi, M., Jin, L., Creativity and criticality: Developing dialogues of learning and thinking through synergy with China (2013) Transnational higher education in the Asian context, pp. 97-117. , Coverdale-Jones T., (ed), Houndsmills: Palgrave Macmillan; Coverdale-Jones, T., Introduction: The widening context of transnational higher education (2013) Transnational higher education in the Asian context, pp. 1-12. , Coverdale-Jones T., (ed), Houndsmills: Palgrave Macmillan; (2014) Teaching style in Denmark, , http://studyindenmark.dk/study-options/the-danish-way-of-teaching-1, Retrieved April 24, 2014, from; (2010) Code of conduct for offering Danish university programmes to international students, , http://dkuni.dk/Internationalt/~/~/media/EAF3BA3FFA4A4A23A7511EF8D2EE17B0.ashx, Retrieved April 24, 2014, from; (2013) Motivation og Studieintensitet Hos Universitetsstuderende.

Where language policy may not be explicitly articulated between members, it is still embedded in how participants micro-manage their interactions and implicit in how members display orientations to deviance, in the case of encountering others in the workplace whose language repertoires or preferences do not meet with expectation pertaining to the institutional position they hold. The study uses recordings of naturally occurring interaction in different international workplace settings and argues for greater attention to be paid to the actual language-policy practices in international workplace settings, as an entry point into developing a more nuanced understanding of the practices through which professional identities are brought about, affirmed or contested, and the linguistic considerations that are implicated in this. © 2015, © 2015 Taylor & Francis.","institutional identity;

However, when cultures in workplaces are mentioned, most people tend to think of cultures in the narrow sense of behavioral interaction, yet culture also includes variables of faith or religions. Therefore, just as people of different cultures may have the potential to clash when they come in contact, so would people of different faiths. Just like culture, diverse faiths have the potential of either enhancing or jeopardizing organizational cohesiveness and achievement of organizational goals. Interfaith dialog as practiced in some banking institutions in Kenya is a case in point. Diamond Trust Bank and Co-operative Bank of Kenya's workforce constitute Christians, Muslims, and Hindus, and as a practice, this workforce meets once a week to pray. This study assesses the effects of interfaith dialog in the workplace in achieving organizational goals. This research presents alternative frameworks for analyzing intercultural communication in the workplace based on the principles of faith. By providing a critique of existing models of language and intercultural communication in the workplace from an interfaith perspective, the aforementioned case could lead to presenting a scenario for the formulation/shaping of a theory of interfaith relations in intercultural workplaces. © 2015, © 2015 Taylor & Francis.","intercultural communication; interfaith dialog; organizational goals; prayer; the workplace",,,,,,"Hong Kong Baptist University, HKBU","We thank the Centre for Research, Publication and Consultancy of Daystar University for financing this research.

They have addressed complex issues and proposed culture general and culture specific models and applied these models in various contexts including workplace interaction. In this paper, we examine the assumptions about the cultural identities of workers in contemporary research and training in intercultural competence. These assumptions seem to reinscribe the colonialist traveler/cosmopolitan – focusing on individual characteristics, motivation, and skill sets, often through a Eurocentric lens. A dialectical perspective foregrounds individual characteristics of competence with larger societal attitudes and laws that impact the treatment of women, gays, and others. A dialectical perspective can help us better understand the opportunities and constraints facing different people in workplaces around the world. By complicating our understanding of competence and taking a dialectical perspective, we hope to advance theory and practice in this important topic area. © 2015, © 2015 Taylor & Francis.","communication; competence; culture; dialectic; global; workplace",,,,,,,,,,"Aguilar, M.J.C., Intercultural communicative competence in the context of the European higher education area (2009) Language & Intercultural Communication, 9, pp. 242-255; Akram, M.A.C., Faheem, M.A., Bin Dost, M.K., Abdullah, I., Globalization and its impacts on the world economic development (2011) International Journal of Business and Social Science, 2, pp. 291-297; Angouri, J., ‘If we know about culture it will be easier to work with one another’: Developing skills for handling corporate meetings with multinational participation (2010) Language & Intercultural Communication, 10, pp. 206-224; Arakelian, C., Professional training: Creating intercultural space in multi-ethnic workplaces (2009) Becoming interculturally competent through education and training, pp. 174-192. , Feng A., Byram M., Fleming M., (eds), Bristol: Multilingual Matters; Arasaratnam, L.A., Research in intercultural communication competence: Past perspectives and future directions (2007) Journal of International Communication, 13 (2), pp. 66-73; Arasaratnam, L., Banerjee, S., Dembek, K., The integrated model of intercultural communication competence (IMICC): Model test (2010) Australian Journal of Communication, 37 (3), pp. 103-116; Bakhtin, M., (1982) The dialogic imagination, , Holquist M., (ed), Austin, TX: University of Texas Press; Bartel-Radic, A., La compétence interculturelle: État de l'art et perspectives (2009) Management International, 13 (4), pp. 11-26; Baxter, L.A., Dialogues of relating (2004) Dialogue: Theorizing difference in communication studies, pp. 107-124. , Anderson R., Baxter L.

Focusing on the viewpoints of the students, rather than central authorities, we attempt to reveal how language use and cultural factors are interpenetrated in the praxis of English-medium instruction (EMI). The data consist of questionnaire responses of 249 Koreans and 61 international students from non-English-speaking countries and qualitative interviews with 23 Korean and 9 international students. Korean participants were found to perceive the effect of English proficiency on achievement (ENG) to be significant, while their confidence in participating in activities in EMI (ACT) classes was the lowest. Whereas the international students did not relate ENG to other factors of EMI, Koreans perceived this factor to be relevant to all the aspects of EMI. During the interviews, international students, with a limited level of tolerance of Korean use, were found to experience frustration with the lack of interaction in their courses. We discuss the findings in terms of ownership of English and highlight how important it is for the Korean and international students to have a shared definition of the role of English as a lingua franca in an EMI classroom. © 2014, © 2014 Taylor & Francis.","English as a lingua franca; English-medium instruction policy; globalization; international students; ownership of English",,,,,,"Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology, UNIST

However, there is a lack of research into the creation of subtitles as a means of intercultural learning. This article is a first empirical attempt to verify the potential of subtitling for intercultural language education. It reports on a case study carried out at an Irish University with 14 A2/B1-level students of Italian, who attended a subtitling module as a regular part of their language course. The aim of the study was to investigate whether the creation of subtitles can offer language students opportunities for learning in terms of cultural and intercultural awareness development. A multi-method approach was employed to collect data through initial and final questionnaires, interviews with participants, class audio-recordings, teaching forms and notes, and students' interlingual subtitles. Thematic analysis of the collected data was then conducted. Findings confirm that teachers play a major role in enhancing students' cultural and intercultural awareness development fostering class interaction and discussions; however, they also show that the use of subtitling tasks offer conditions in which students can better develop intercultural skills even when teacher mediation is limited. © 2014, © 2014 Taylor & Francis.","audio-visual translation; foreign language education; intercultural education; intercultural learning; language teaching; subtitling",,,,,,,,,,"Agar, M., The intercultural frame (1994) International Journal of Intercultural Relations, 18, pp. 221-237; Baker, W., From cultural awareness to intercultural awareness: Culture in ELT (2012) ELT Journal, 66; Barrett, M., Byram, M., Lázár, I., Mompoint-Gaillard, P., Philippou, S., (2013) Developing intercultural competence through education, , Strasbourg: Council of Europe; Belz, J.A., Thorne, S.L., (2006) Internet-mediated intercultural foreign language education, , Boston, MA: Heinle & Heinle; Bennett, M.J., Towards ethnorelativism: A developmental model of intercultural sensibility (1993) Education for the intercultural experience, pp. 21-71. , Paige R.

However, research on the specificities of interpreting for this community is rather scarce. I therefore conducted a study to shed light on this topic, focusing on PSI for the Chinese in Catalonia, a region where this service began only relatively recently. This paper discusses the results of the research. The research was conducted using a mixed method. Qualitative interviews were held with interpreters and mediators who work with Chinese people and with coordinators of PSI and intercultural mediation, while quantitative questionnaires were distributed among Chinese users of public services. The three sets of data were analysed independently, and triangulation was used to validate the results and to compare and contrast the information collected from each sample of informants. This article presents the triangulation and elucidates some specificities and challenges of PSI for the Chinese, namely, Chinese linguistic diversity, mediating between cultures and gaining users' trust. The discussion and conclusions stress the importance of including specific strategies to face these challenges in training and education, while also underlining the critical role of coordinators in the professionalisation of PSI. © 2014, © 2014 Taylor & Francis.","Catalonia; Chinese; community interpreting; intercultural communication; intercultural mediation; public service interpreting",,,,,,,"This paper has been supported by MIRAS and InterAsia research groups.

The article presents the conclusions of a qualitative research project investigating the sources and nature of their attachment. It demonstrates that the students' professed love of the language has to do with their successful appropriation of various facets of the English languaculture for the enrichment of their self-identity, which remains fundamentally rooted in the local habitus. The interlacing of global and local elements, recognized and taken ownership of through the telling of life stories, does not lead the students to a rejection of one identity in favor of another. Rather, it results in a composite, richer self-identity, woven of different cultural strands. Finally, the article discusses possible pedagogical implications of the learner experiences delineated in the students' accounts and supports the call for creative, student-focused pedagogy in second-language education, rich in intercultural knowledge and in opportunities for self-development and self-expression. © 2014, © 2014 Taylor & Francis.","English; identity; intercultural awareness; Israel; language attitudes; language learning",,,,,,,,,,"Agar, M., (1995) Language shock: Understanding the culture of conversation, , New York, NY: William Morrow; Amara, M., The place of Arabic in Israel (2002) International Journal of the Sociology of Language, 158, pp. 53-68; Anderson, B., (1991) Imagined communities: Reflections on the origins and spread of nationalism, , Rev. ed, London: Verso; Ayalon, H., Ben-Raphael, E., Sharot, S., Secularization and the diminishing decline of religion (1995) Israeli Judaism: The sociology of religion in Israel, pp. 239-255. , Deshen S.

Drawing upon interviews with one young black woman in the south of England, this paper presents findings concerning the patterns of talk and the rhetorical strategies followed to recount experiences of differential treatment. The analysis, inspired by a critical discursive approach, points to the negative construction of the majority group and identifies a number of recurring devices used to bolster the facticity of the accounts. These include the presentation and quoting of self and others, the explicit invocation of category entitlements and the use of extreme case formulations, particularly in anticipation of non-sympathetic hearings. Given the prohibitions on making accusations of racism, the paper culminates with a discussion on factuality which this research attributes to the presence of the white interviewer. © 2014, © 2014 Taylor & Francis.","critical discourse analysis; differential treatment; factuality; people of colour; racism; rhetorical strategies",,,,,,,,,,"Augoustinos, M., Every, D., The language of “race” and prejudice: A discourse of denial, reason, and liberal-practical politics (2007) Journal of Language and Social Psychology, 26 (2), pp. 123-141; Augoustinos, M., Every, D., Accusations and denials of racism: Managing moral accountability in public discourse (2010) Discourse & Society, 21, pp. 251-256; Augoustinos, M., Tuffin, K., Rapley, M., Genocide or a failure to gel?

The research project Journeys from Images to Words explored the potential of visual texts to address these issues. Working in Glasgow primary schools within critical pedagogical frameworks that invite sharing of personal narratives and of cultural knowledge, the researchers examined and evaluated an image-based approach, both for reading and responding to a selection of children's texts and for obtaining an insight into the home literacy practices of diverse communities. In this article, a 'generative theme', as used by Paulo Freire is used to examine how students engaged with reading visual texts, shared their responses and extended their intercultural understanding. The results from this project provide evidence for the inclusion of visual texts and methodologies within critical pedagogies in order to develop intercultural literacy in the classroom. © 2014 © 2014 Taylor & Francis.","critical pedagogy; generative themes; immigration; intercultural literacy; visual methods; visual texts",,,,,,"EsmÃ©e Fairbairn Foundation, EF

Cultural differences and conflicts, stereotypes and other complex issues regarding the diasporic lives of the Chinese sojourners are revealed vividly in those stories. In the intercultural language teaching of Chinese in USA, Australia and Europe, a central and pressing task is to improve students' intercultural sensitivities and develop the capability to communicate efficiently with China and Chinese people. In light of critical literary studies that treat literature as a kind of 'cultural artefact' and recent analysis of Hay and Wang which advocates 'migratory' literature as a 'third place' for intercultural communication, this paper takes a step further. It does so by expanding the spectrum into Chinese norms, stereotypes and some core values that are significant in intercultural communication with Chinese and explores interdisciplinary approaches to linking studies of Chinese migrant literature and the intercultural education of Chinese at university level. © 2014 © 2014 Taylor & Francis.","'migratory' literature; Chinese migrant literature; intercultural education; intercultural sensitivity; teaching Chinese as a second language; third place",,,,,,,"Dr Wang Yongyang is a research fellow, and executive director in the Australian federal government funded research project, ‘Intercultural Approaches to Teaching Chinese: A Basis for Pedagogical Innovation’ and recipient of Guizhou Education Bureau ‘Migratory Scholar Grant’.

The article explores the way migrants are constructed and represented in the language of long-term residents. The data reveals an anti-migration discourse on the side of the long-term residents as the migrants are identified as culturally (e.g. not 'urban'); linguistically (e.g. Kyrgyz speaking having poor Russian); and behaviourally (e.g. uncivilised) as not being part of their past, present or future vision of Bishkek. The article looks also at the ways in which migrants themselves perceive their position in Bishkek. Their narratives highlight the diversity present amongst the migrant population, and demonstrate a counter-representation of themselves and their place within a changing city, which in its very pragmatism and realism, contests the simplistic representation favoured by the long-term residents. The article reveals important insights into emerging notions of both urban identity and Kyrgyz identity in the post-Soviet period, where linguistic and ethnic boundaries become blurred and moveable and new categories of inclusion and exclusion are constructed. © 2014 © 2014 Taylor & Francis.","Bishkek; Kyrgyzstan; long-term resident; migration; mutual perceptions; urban change",,,,,,"Leverhulme Trust","This work was supported by the Leverhulme Trust, under Grant no.

It is concerned, in particular, to examine the role played by interpreters in facilitating intercultural communication between asylum applicants and the different administrative and legal actors responsible for assessing or defending their claims. The first section provides an overview of refugee status determination procedures in the UK and France, introducing the main administrative and legal contexts of the asylum process within which interpreters operate in the two countries. The second section compares the organisation of interpreting services, codes of conduct for interpreters and institutional expectations about the nature of interpreters' activity on the part of the relevant UK and French authorities. The third section then explores some of the practical dilemmas for interpreters and barriers to communication that exist in refugee status determination procedures in the two countries. The article concludes by emphasising the complex and active nature of the interpreter's role in UK and French refugee status determination procedures. © 2014 © 2014 The Author(s).

Drawing from an ethnographic case study among patients of a transcultural consultation for migrants in Portugal, the analysis focuses on the contents and forms of the interaction observed by the anthropologist in the clinical setting. A repetitive pattern of communication between a refugee women patient and her psychiatrist foregrounded the unsaid within the interaction as well as the unwillingness of the refugee to speak about her life with the anthropologist. In this sense, we propose to understand silence as a form of communication pointing to both the condition of the patient but more significantly embedded in the institutional framework of the clinical setting, discursive positions of the participants, as well as their social statuses. Following the theoretical work of Jaworski, Wagner and Winter, our analysis of silence leads us to the critical examination of the question of privilege in intercultural situations pointing to a necessary deconstruction of post-colonial institutional object/subject positions. In practical terms, this challenge corresponds to the work of international cross-cultural psychiatry (in terms of clinical matters) as well as that of biographical research and research on memory among migrants and refugees. © 2014 © 2014 Taylor & Francis.","asymmetries; biographical research; communication; new cross-cultural psychiatry; silence",,,,,,,"This research was funded by The Portuguese National Science Foundation (Fundação para a Ciência a Tecnologia).

Foregrounding intertextuality and 'writing back' in a postcolonial context as intercultural communication modes, this paper explores the intertextual relations between the novel and the film; it examines the use of irony and multivocal narrative in Lakhous' novel as strategies of intercultural mediation. Moreover, it interrogates the works' social, cultural, historical and linguistic movements to analyse the narrativizations of familiarity and estrangement. Divorzio all'islamica a viale Marconi enables a dialogue between local cultures and 'guest' cultures by tracing (obliterated) common histories, shared experiences and similar social and cultural predicaments across the northern and southern shores of the Mediterranean, remapping geographical and cultural terrains. © 2014 © 2014 Taylor & Francis.","Amara Lakhous; intercultural communication; intertextuality; Italy; postcolonialism",,,,,,,,,,"Allievi, S., Immigration and cultural pluralism in Italy: Multiculturalism as a missing model (2010) Italian Culture, 28 (2), pp. 85-103; Baraldi, C., (2003) Comunicazione interculturale e diversità [Intercultural communication and diversity], , Rome,: Carocci; Bhabha, H., (1994) The location of culture, , London,: Routledge; Bhabha, H., Foreword to the 1986 edition (2008) Black skin white masks, pp. xxi-xxxvii. , In: Fanon F., editors London,: Pluto Press; Bouchard, N., Reading the discourse of multicultural Italy: Promises and challenges of transnational Italy in an era of global migration (2010) Italian Culture, 28 (2), pp. 104-120; Brancato, S., From routes to roots afrosporic voices in Italy (2007) Callaloo, 30, pp. 653-661; Brancato, S., Afro-European literature(s): A new discursive category?

Based on chat sessions between university students studying intercultural communication in two European countries (both 'local' and international students), the article proposes to put discursive pragmatics (DP) (French pragmatics and Dialogism) into practice to examine how the students construct interculturality online during several chat sessions.

The results of this review provide insight on the status of the intercultural perspective in FLT in Colombia by looking at the epistemological, theoretical, practical, and ideological issues that have sprung out of the thrust to articulate the cultural dimension in language teaching. This paper reviews six major refereed journals, concentrating on the types of articles published and the characteristics of research on culture. Findings indicate that the influence of sociocultural perspectives has propelled language teachers to move from a linguistic approach toward an intercultural approach to language and culture. Researchers favor qualitative research designs to explore linguistic and social issues, such as intercultural communication, cultural representations, and identity. The challenges that teachers and researchers face suggest that the intercultural dimension is still in its infancy in the Colombian scholarship. © 2014 © 2014 Taylor & Francis.","culture; EFL in Colombia; foreign language teaching; intercultural communication",,,,,,,,,,"Agudelo, J., An intercultural approach for language teaching: Developing critical cultural awareness (2007) Íkala, 12, pp. 185-217; Álvarez, J.A., Bonilla, X., Addressing culture in the EFL classroom: A dialogic proposal (2009) Profile, 11, pp. 151-170; Álvarez, J.A., Cárdenas, M., González, A., Coverage vs continuity: Two challenges faced by the professional development of teachers of English in Bilingual Colombia (2011) Fundamentos para el Desarrollo Profesional de los Profesores de Inglés [Basis for professional development of teachers of English], pp. 119-154. , In: Bastidas J., Muñoz G., editors Pasto,: Editorial Gráfico Color; Anderson, L., Postlethwaite, N., (2007) Program evaluation: Large-scale and small-scale studies, , Paris and Brussels,: The International Institute for Educational Planning and the International Academy of Education; Arias, L., Campo, E., Zuluaga, J., Apropos of accreditation: Coursebook evaluation and culture implementation in FLC (2001) Folios, 13, pp. 129-146; Guidelines for contributors, , http://www.asocopi.org/files/Guidelines_for_Contributors_NV.pdf, Asocopi, n.d, Retrieved from; Assunção Barbosa, L., Language-culture and intercultural dimensions in the teaching and learning of a foreign language (2007) Íkala, 12, pp. 165-181; Barletta, N., Intercultural competence: Another challenge (2009) Profile, 11, pp. 143-158; Barrera, M., Cantor, S., Socio-cultural stereotypes: Exploring students' perceptions regarding social issues (2007) HOW, 14, pp. 153-164; Basabe, E., From de-anglicization to internationalisation: cultural representations of the UK and the USA in global, adapted and local ELT textbooks in Argentina (2006) Profile, 7, pp. 59-75; Bayley, R., Schecter, S., (2003) Language socialization in bilingual and multilingual societies, , Clevedon,: Multilingual Matters; Beckman, K., Smith, S., Cross-cultural understanding through visual representation (2006) Colombian Applied Linguistics Journal, 8, pp. 137-151; Block, D., (2003) The social turn in second language acquisition, , Edinburgh,: Edinburgh University Press; Block, D., The structure and agency dilemma in identity and intercultural communication research (2013) Language and Intercultural Communication, 13 (2), pp. 126-147; Blommaert, J., Backus, A., Superdiverse repertoires and the individual (2013) Multilingualism and multimodality, pp. 11-32. , In: De Saint-Georges I., Weber J.

Mock language refers to the (usually negative) connotations that emerge as a result of the dual indexicality of borrowed words. Dual indexicality functions by allowing speakers to draw on stereotypes about other languages and speakers, thus reinforcing the role of languages as boundary marking devices. Using the methodological approach 'cross-linguistic corpus-assisted discourse studies', this paper draws on English and French examples from a corpus of Canadian newspapers. In Canada, languages serve not only as boundary markers, but also as icons of national groups; thus, borrowed words have implications for understandings of belonging in Canada and other multilingual and multicultural nations. © 2014 © 2014 Taylor & Francis.","borrowing; Canada; corpus linguistics; English; French; mock language",,,,,,,,,,"Baker, P., (2006) Using corpora in discourse analysis, , London & New York,: Continuum; Blommaert, J., The debate is open (1999) Language ideological debates, pp. 1-38. , In: Blommaert J., editors Berlin,: Mouton de Gruyter; Bouchard, C., (2002) La langue et le nombril: Histoire d'une obsession québécoise [Obsessed with language: A sociolinguistic history of Quebec], , Montreal,: Fides; Bourhis, R.Y., Montreuil, A., Helly, D., Jantzen, L., Discrimination et linguicisme au Québec: Enquête sur la diversité ethnique au Canada [Discrimination and linguicism in Quebec: An investigation into ethnic diversity in Canada] (2007) Canadian Ethnic Studies, 39, pp. 31-49; Callahan, L., Speaking with (dis)respect: A study of reactions to Mock Spanish (2010) Language and Intercultural Communication, 10, pp. 299-317; Cardinal, L., Linguistic peace: A time to take stock (2008) Inroads, 23, pp. 62-70; Chun, E., Ideologies of legitimate mockery: Margaret Cho's revoicings of Mock Asian (2004) Pragmatics, 14, pp. 263-289; Collard, N., La possibilité d'une île [The possibility of an island] (2009) La Presse, , June 27, Saturday, p.

This paper discusses the issue of student intercultural learning and development in the Vietnamese English as a foreign language (EFL) class. Especially, it addresses the use of film as an innovative approach to engage Vietnamese students in intercultural learning and development in the EFL classroom. The study reported in this paper draws on rich sources of data which include in-depth interviews with students, student reflective journals and video-recorded class observations at a university in central Vietnam. Overall, five key themes relating to student intercultural learning through film have been identified in this study. These include enhancing knowledge about cultural differences, engaging in cross-cultural comparison, breaking cultural stereotypes, immersing students in authentic learning and living in the world of 'other' culture and the integrated mode of intercultural language learning. The study is a significant contribution to scholarly research on the use of media objects to enhance student intercultural learning in language classrooms in developing countries. © 2013 © 2013 Taylor & Francis.","intercultural competence; language learning; Vietnam",,,,,,,,,,"Bennett, M.J., Towards ethnorelativism: A developmental model of intercultural sensitivity (1993) Education for the intercultural experience, pp. 21-71. , In: Paige R.

An action research project on the Malvinas/Falklands war fought between Argentina and the UK in 1982 was carried out in 2012. Through a comparative methodology involving Argentine and English foreign language classes, students develop a critical perspective on texts while they also create an international identification, different from their national/regional identifications. While the existing body of work on intercultural citizenship and criticality in the foreign language classroom is abundant in Europe, North America and Asia, empirical studies hardly exist in this region and one of the questions to be answered deals with the transferability of curriculum research across continents. After a description of the theoretical framework and the project itself, I present student samples and analysis that provide evidence that this intercultural citizenship project was fruitfully implemented for the first time in Argentinean Higher Education in the foreign language classroom. I then outline the significance of the project from the point of view of online intercultural communication and the theory of intercultural citizenship. © 2014 © 2014 Taylor & Francis.","Argentina; comparative methodology; foreign language education; intercultural citizenship; online intercultural communication",,,,,,"Universidad Nacional de La Plata, UNLP

Three groups of students, Hong Kong Chinese, Mainland Chinese, and Overseas Exchange students, were asked to characterise these three groups in a pre-discussion questionnaire, and subsequently discuss freely what they had written. Selected excerpts from these discussions are analysed, and the analyses show that there are significant differences between the written and the oral responses. The pre-discussion stereotypes appear to be predominantly positive, whereas the students jointly construct predominantly negative stereotypes about 'the other' during their discussions. Different discourse strategies are employed by the three groups to discredit 'the other' and, at the same time, enhance intergroup differentiation and a positive ingroup identity. The findings are discussed vis-à-vis predominantly social psychological theories, and the study highlights that the attempt to create more internationalised universities may be jeopardised if negative intergroup stereotypes prevail. The article suggests that universities should take a more proactive role in promoting anti-racist multicultural education to counter intergroup prejudice and potential conflict. © 2014 © 2014 Taylor & Francis.","anti-racist multicultural education; Hong Kong; intergroup conflict; internationalisation; prejudice; stereotypes",,,,,,,,,,"Abrams, D., Hogg, M.A., The context of discourse: Let's not throw out the baby with the bathwater (1990) Philosophical Psychology, 3, pp. 219-225; Augoustinos, M., Every, D., The language of ""race"" and prejudice: A discourse of denial, reason, and liberal-practical politics (2007) Journal of Language and Social Psychology, 26 (2), pp. 123-141; Augoustinos, M., Walker, I., Donaghue, N., (2006) Social cognition: An integrated introduction, , 2nd ed., London and Thousand Oaks, CA,: Sage; Bateson, G., (1972) Steps to an ecology of mind, , New York, NY,: Ballantine Books; Bauml, B.J., Bauml, F.H., (1997) Dictionary of worldwide gestures, , Lanham, MD,: Scarecrow Press; Billig, M., (1996) Arguing and thinking: A rhetorical approach to social psychology, , 2nd ed., Cambridge,: Cambridge University Press; Billig, M., Discursive psychology, rhetoric and the issue of agency (2009) Semen: Revue de sémio-linguistique des textes et discours, 27, pp. 1-18; Bredella, L., What does it mean to be intercultural (2003) Intercultural experience and education, pp. 225-239. , In: Alred G., Byram M., Fleming M., editors Clevedon,: Multilingual Matters; Brown, P., Levinson, S., (1987) Politeness: Some universals in language usage, , Cambridge,: Cambridge University Press; Byram, M., The 'value' of academic mobility (2008) Students, staff and academic mobility in higher education, pp. 31-47. , In: Byram M., Dervin F., editors Cambridge,: Cambridge Scholars; Byram, M., (2008) From foreign language education to education for intercultural citizenship, , Clevedon,: Multilingual Matters; Byram, M., Education, training and becoming critical (2009) Becoming interculturally competent through education and training, pp. 211-213. , In: Feng A., Byram M., Fleming M., editors Clevedon,: Multilingual Matters; Byram, M., Feng, A., (2006) Living and studying abroad: Research and practice, , Clevedon,: Multilingual Matters; Chen, G.-M., Differences in self-disclosure patterns among Americans versus Chinese: A comparative study (1995) Journal of Cross-Cultural Psychology, 26 (1), pp. 84-91; Condor, S., Figgou, L., Abell, J., Gibson, S., Stevenson, C., They're not racist...'

The group was made up of 12 people representing different institutions in the community, namely primary schools, cultural and social associations and the local council. The project takes an intercultural approach to diversity by focusing on strategies aimed at: (1) increasing language awareness through intercultural education in primary school, (2) promoting intercultural dialogue and (3) enhanced development of intercultural competence of all participants. Data were collected through a 30-minute interview, carried out individually with each of the partners at the end of the project. Participants' responses showed that the activities carried out during the project were an important way to promote the development of their intercultural competence. They also mentioned that working in partnership was a successful method to promote reflection and to improve their working practices concerning intercultural education. © 2014 © 2014 Taylor & Francis.","educational partnerships; intercultural competence; intercultural dialogue; intercultural education",,,,,,"Ministeriet for Forskning Innovation og VideregÃ¥ende Uddannelser

To do this, they must be aware of the similarities and differences between their own and other cultures and of cultural biases that they and other people may have. This paper reports on the use of pedagogical blogging in a professional communication module to encourage students to reflect on their awareness and application of intercultural communication skills when working on group assignments inside and outside the classroom. The elective module attracted mostly second- and third-year Science and Engineering undergraduate students, and a few other students from first and honours years and other degree programmes such as Business and Computer Science. Also, although the majority of the students were Singaporeans, the module also attracted Malaysian, Indonesian, Indian, Chinese, western European and Korean students. As the module aimed to help students hone their verbal and written communication for the professional arena, it incorporated intercultural communication, a subset of professional communication competence and skills necessary for the global workplace today. This paper discusses students' reflective blog posts on their own as well as their peers' intercultural interactions in group learning tasks and assignments. © 2014 © 2014 Taylor & Francis.","global workplace; intercultural competence; pedagogical blogging",,,,,,,,,,"Benoit, W.L., Benoit, P.J., (2008) Persuasive messages: The process of influence, , Malden, MA,: Blackwell; Bills, D.B., (2004) The sociology of education & work, , Oxford,: Blackwell; Byram, M., (1997) Teaching & assessing intercultural communicative competence, , Clevedon,: Philadelphia Multilingual Matters; Deardorff, D.K., Identification and assessment of intercultural competence as a student outcome of internationalization (2006) Journal of Studies in International Education, 10, pp. 241-266; Deardorff, D., (2009) The Sage handbook of intercultural competence, , Thousand Oaks, CA,: Sage; Dippold, D., Peer feedback through blogs: Student and teacher perceptions in an advanced German class (2009) ReCALL, 21 (1), pp. 18-36. , http://www.journals.cambridge.org/REC, Retrieved from; Duffy, P., Bruns, A., The use of blogs, wikis and RSS in education: A conversation of possibilities (2006) Online learning and teaching conference 2006, pp. 31-38. , http://www.eprints.qut.edu.au, Retrieved from; Eckert, P., McConnell-Ginet, S., Think practically and look locally: Language and gender as community-based practice (1992) Annual Review of Anthropology, 21, pp. 461-488; Fairclough, N., (1995) Critical discourse analysis, , London,: Longman; Hartley, P., (1999) Interpersonal communication, , 2nd ed, London,: Routledge; Hill, J.H., Mannheim, B., Language and world view (1992) Annual Review of Anthropology, 21, pp. 381-404; Holmes, J., Meyerhoff, M., The community of practice: Theories and methodologies in language and gender research (1999) Language in Society, 28, pp. 173-183; Hourigan, T., Murray, L., Using blogs to help language students to develop reflective learning strategies: Towards a pedagogical framework (2010) Australasian Journal of Educational Technology, 26, pp. 209-225; Kramsch, C., Intercultural communication (2001) The Cambridge guide to teaching English to speakers of other languages, pp. 201-206. , In: Carter R., Nunan D., editors 1st ed, Cambridge,: Cambridge University Press; Kramsch, C., The uses of communicative competence in a global world (2007) English language teaching in China: New approaches, perspectives and standards, pp. 56-74. , In: Liu J., editors London,: Continuum International; Kramsch, C., The symbolic dimensions of the intercultural (2011) Language Teaching, 44, pp. 354-367; Lave, J., Wenger, E., (1991) Situated learning: Legitimate peripheral participation, , Cambridge,: Cambridge University Press; Liddicoat, A.J., Communication as culturally contexted practice: A view from intercultural communication (2009) Australian Journal of Linguistics, 29, pp. 115-133; Oikonomidoy, E., Conceptual collective online reflection in multicultural education classes (2009) Multicultural Education & Technology Journal, 3, pp. 130-143; Ruddock, A., (2007) Investigating audiences, , London,: Sage; Scollon, R., Scollon, S.W., (2001) Intercultural communication: A discourse approach, , 2nd ed, Oxford,: Blackwell","Jaidev, R.; Centre for English Language Communication, National University of Singapore, Singapore, Singapore; email: elcrj@nus.edu.sg",,,,,,,,14708477,,,,"English","Lang.

These courses include knowledge of history, arts, science, society, law and medicine, etc., and require English as the bridge between Chinese cultures and English cultures. English departments (or schools) are responsible for introducing foreign civilization within the framework of GE, resulting in the increasingly crucial role of English teachers in China in helping students to develop their intercultural knowledge, skills and awareness. In this new curriculum, teachers and students must acquire the skills for English reading, news listening, academic writing, and conference presenting. This changing scenario means that intercultural competence will need to be a new goal for all English teachers and students in China. In this paper, the development of GE in China is discussed, along with the setting of core courses for GE, and the relationship of GE and Intercultural Communication based on a 'news-listening' class analysis. © 2014 © 2014 Taylor & Francis.","Chinese universities; General education; intercultural awareness; intercultural competence; intercultural knowledge; intercultural skills",,,,,,,,,,"Byram, M., (1997) Teaching and assessing intercultural communicative competence, , Clevedon,: Multilingual Matters; Byram, M.S., Risager, K., (1999) Language teachers, politics and cultures, , Clevedon,: Multilingual Matters; Olson, C.L., Kroeger, K.R., Global competency and intercultural sensitivity (2001) Journal of Studies in International Education, 5 (2), pp. 116-137; Paige, R.M., (1993) Education for the intercultural experience, , Yarmouth, ME,: Intercultural Press; Wang, Y., University general education and culture quality education (2006) Peking University Education Review, 4 (3), pp. 2-8; Yang, S., (2007) Listen to news, , Beijing,: Foreign Language Teaching and Research Press; Zhu, X., The notions of general education in American universities (2005) Inner-Mongolia Normal University Transactions, 18 (1), pp. 5-8; http://www.fudan.edu.cn; http://hexin.fudan.edu.cn/edu/www.web.magazine.php?id=51; http://www.comsci.sysu.edu.cn; http://news.shisu.edu.cn/mediashisu","Wang, T.; School of Foreign Languages, Harbin Institute of Technology, 92 West Dazhi Street, Nangang District, Harbin 150001, China; email: lucyclass6@hit.edu.cn",,,,,,,,14708477,,,,"English","Lang.

In this article, we discuss this type of dialogue under the conditions of asymmetry and categorisation in two Finnish schools. Finnish education has often been lauded for its successful implementation of equity and equality by the thousands of 'pedagogical tourists' who visit the country's schools to witness the so-called miracle of Finnish education due to Finland's excellent results in the OECD Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) study. Through theoretically informed reading of ethnographic data, we examine how Self and Other are constructed in everyday encounters in school and how religions, religious groups and individuals become regarded as Others. We also ask whether the aims of interreligious dialogue in schools represent a viable way to learn about each other and to increase mutual understanding. The theoretical and methodological approaches derive from post-colonial, post-structural and related feminist theories as well as from recent research on intercultural education and communication. © 2014 © 2014 Taylor & Francis.","Finnish education; interculturality; interreligious dialogue; Otherness; understanding",,,,,,,,,,"Ahmed, S., (2012) On being included.

In this paper, I discuss the modalities in which the notion of competence is used to conceptualise responsibility and the relationship between self and other in intercultural research, in order to critique the Cartesian presuppositions of intercultural communication theory. I argue that models of competence and responsibility that are employed to design intercultural training operate within the paradigm of the autonomous rational agent that informs Kantian ethical thinking. I contrast the model of the competent intercultural speaker that emerges in intercultural research with the distinction proposed by Levinas between the saying and the said (le dire and le dit, meaning the event of speech and the content of speech), to suggest two scenarios of intercultural interaction that show two different approaches to responsibility, one operating in the dimension of the said and the other in the dimension of the saying. Thus, in this paper, I discuss the implications of Levinas's reflection on the nature of language for the development of an ethical framework that addresses the limitations of current conceptualisations in intercultural communication theory of competence and responsibility. © 2014 © 2014 Taylor & Francis.","ethical communication; intercultural competences; language learning; Levinas; responsibility",,,,,,,,,,"Adorno, T.W., Horkheimer, M., (1997) Dialectic of enlightenment, , London and New York, NY,: Verso; Anderson, B., (1991) Imagined communities: Reflections on the origins and spread of nationalism, , London and New York, NY,: Verso; Atwell, J.E., (1986) Ends and principles in Kant's moral thought, , Dordrecht, Boston, and Lancaster,: Martinus Nijhoff; Barnett, G.A., Lee, M., Issues in intercultural communication (2002) Handbook of international and intercultural communication, pp. 275-290. , In: Gudykunst W.

This study analyses the indexing of cultural identities in international, interorganisational meetings. The approach used draws on methods and insights from corpus linguistics and discourse analysis, professional communication, intercultural studies and identity studies. It explores how a statistically significant single item, we, in specialised corpora of authentic professional meetings, signals different identities at different moments in the unfolding discourse. Specifically, two research questions are answered: What cultural identities are explicitly indexed in business meetings through we?What can corpus linguistics contribute to IC studies?While the first question comprises the bulk of the paper, the second question is discussed in the final section, along with limitations of the approach applied here. © 2014 © 2014 Taylor & Francis.","'we'; corpus linguistics; cultural identities; international meetings; interorganizational meetings; professional discourse",,,,,,,,,,"Alvesson, M., (2002) Understanding organizational culture, , Newbury Park, CA,: Sage; Antaki, C., Widdicombe, S., Identity as an achievement and as a tool (1998) Identities in talk, pp. 1-15. , In: Antaki C., Widdicombe S., editors London,: Sage; Aston, G., Notes on the interlanguage of comity (1993) Interlanguage pragmatics, pp. 224-250. , In: Kasper G., Blum-Kulka S., editors Oxford,: Oxford University Press; Baker, P., (2006) Using corpora in discourse analysis, , London,: Continuum; Bargiela-Chiappini, F., Harris, S., (1997) Managing language: The discourse of corporate meetings, , Amsterdam,: John Benjamins; Benwell, B., Stokoe, E., (2006) Discourse and identity, , Edinburgh,: Edinburgh University Press; Biber, D., (1988) Variation across speech and writing, , Cambridge,: Cambridge University Press; Bucholtz, M., Hall, K., Identity and interaction: A sociocultural linguistic approach (2005) Discourse Studies, 7, pp. 585-614; Clifton, J., Van De Mieroop, D., Doing' ethos-A discursive approach to the strategic deployment and negotiation of identities in meetings (2010) Journal of Pragmatics, 42, pp. 2449-2461; Collier, M.J., Thomas, M., Cultural identity: An interpretive perspective (1988) Theories in intercultural communication, pp. 99-120. , In: Kim Y.

The central tenets of the approach, developed by Amartya Sen and Martha Nussbaum, involve a set of humanistic goals including the recognition that development is a process whereby people's freedoms are expanded, and in so doing, increasing the capabilities of individuals to lead valuable lives. How the construct of capabilities can be seen to work in practice is demonstrated here through a description and presentation of findings from an insider-practitioner case study concerning the teaching and learning of English to Speakers of Other Languages (ESOL) in higher education and based on a critical cosmopolitan pedagogical approach. Evidence from the study indicates that cosmopolitan citizenship learning has a valued place in an ESOL multicultural classroom in which intercultural dialogue is fostered. A proposal is made to use the capabilities approach as a normative framework for social justice in the field of foreign language and intercultural education. © 2014 © 2014 Taylor & Francis.","agency;

I argue that this concept is one which may work and make sense in stable, open and equal jurisdictions where there is relative 'freedom from fear and want', but that it is at best, limited and at worst, dangerous when used in situations of conflict and aggression and under the creeping conditions of precarity which mark out the present form of globalisation. In this, I turn to field visits undertaken in the Gaza Strip in 2012 with the Life Long Learning in Palestine project. I make a connection to the work of Carolin Goerzig, with Hamas, to the conflict transformation practice of Jean Paul Lederach and to Graeber, Bigo and Scarry's theoretical and practical consideration of emergency and security conditions post-9/11. I do so in order to argue for a re-politicised concept of intercultural dialogue such that it might fit the conditions of precarity with which the field of Language and Intercultural Communication is concerned. © 2014 © 2014 Taylor & Francis.","conflict transformation; creative practice; Gaza; Intercultural Dialogue; multiple identities; refugees",,,,,,,,,,"Appadurai, A., (1996) Modernity at large: Cultural dimensions of globalization, , Minneapolis,: University of Minnesota Press; Barber, K., Improvisation and the art of making things stick (2007) Creativity and cultural improvisation, pp. 25-45. , In: Hallam E., Ingold T., editors Oxford,: Berg; Benjamin, W., (1973) Illuminations, , London,: Fontana; Bigo, D., Globalized-in-security: The field of the ban-opticon (2006) Translation, biopolitics, colonial difference, pp. 109-156. , In: Sakal N.

For a long time, the ideal learner was a faithful imitator whose L2 use and cultural conduct were strictly modeled on the native speaker (NS). With postcolonial changes around the world, a legitimate speaker was born, claiming equal language standards and rights with NSs.

However, for intercultural communication specialists, especially those with a linguistic focus, the Ladino experiences of Sephardic Jews in Bulgaria, as set against the backdrop of their changing political and social realities, provide rich insights regarding the linguistic complexities of identity. Through the Ladino-framed narratives of (often elderly) members of this community, we have learned how they drew, and continue to draw, upon their diverse linguistic and cultural resources to define themselves, to articulate their various identities, and to communicate within and beyond Bulgarian society. In order to connect these insights to current discussions of interculturality, and as informed by intercultural thinking, we developed the following five-zone framework: (1) the (intra-)personal, that is a zone of internal dialogue; (2) the domestic, that is a zone for the family; (3) the local, that is a zone for the Sephardic community in Bulgaria; (4) the diasporic, that is a zone for the wider Sephardic Jewish community; and (5) the international, that is the international community of Spanish-speakers. Further, the project presented here is methodologically innovative involving: several languages (i.e. it was researched multilingually as well as focused on multilingual communities) and therefore issues of translation and representation; and the use of researcher narratives as an additional means for managing the inherent reflexivities in our work. © 2014 © 2014 Taylor & Francis.","identity performance; Ladino; linguistic identity; narrative research; Sephardim; zones of interculturality",,,,,,,,,,"Alfassa, S., (1999) A quick explanation of Ladino (Judeo-Spanish), , http://www.sephardicstudies.org/quickladino.html, New York, NY,: Foundation for the Advancement of Sephardic Studies and Culture (FASSAC), Retrieved, 24 February, 2011, from; Andrews, J., Holmes, P., Fay, R., Researching multilingually' special issue (2013) International Journal of Applied Linguistics, 23 (3), pp. 285-299; Annavi, I., Explanatory notes about the name of the spoken language of the Sephardims (2007) Manuel de Judaeo-Espagnol, p. 9. , In: Varol M., editors Sofia,: Shalom, accessed via the Bulgarian text; Austin, J.L., (1961) How to do things with words, , Oxford,: Clarendon Press; Bhabha, H.K., The third space (1990) Identity: Community, culture, difference, pp. 207-221. , In: Rutherford J., editors London,: Lawrence and Wishart; Brittan, A., (1989) Masculinity and power, , Oxford,: Blackwell; Bruner, J.S., The narrative construction of reality (1991) Critical Inquiry, 18, pp. 1-21; Bruner, J.S., (1996) The narrative construal of reality, , Boston, MA,: Harvard University Press; Butler, J., (1991) Gender trouble: Feminism and the subversion of identity, , New York,: Routledge; Cameron, D., Performing gender identity (1997) Language and masculinity, pp. 47-64. , In: Johnson S., Meinhof H.

This paper explores the use of Hispanic and Latino (and to a lesser extent Latin American) in US official documents and quality news outlets within the framework of narrative theory. The Census Office documents and seven national newspapers, namely, The New York Times, The Washington Post, The Boston Globe, The Miami Herald, The Arizona Republic, San Francisco Chronicle and Los Angeles Times will be analysed. They represent the areas with large immigrant populations, on the one hand, and with descendants of Spanish-speaking peoples on the other. The paper will explore (1) the evolution of these terms in official use, that is, the US Census Office reports, (2) whether quality news media use of the terms has evolved in a similar way to official use or whether there is some degree of divergence between the two, (3) whether we can talk about regional variation and, finally, (4) whether the representation of the Hispanic minority in quality news media is largely negative, as it has been claimed for the media in general. The findings suggest that while official use is relatively stable, quality media use of the terms is largely unpredictable, although they do not seem to project a negative image of the minority. © 2013 Taylor & Francis.","American media; Hispanic; Latin American; Latino; US Census reports",,,,,,"University of Massachusetts Amherst

Readers of intercultural intertexts fall into two general groups: knowing readers (who know the source text) and unknowing readers (who do not know the source text). This paper aims to explore Taiwanese unknowing students' responses to Western-derived allusive intertexts. Eight instances of intercultural intertexts were drawn systematically from the article titles of the British magazine spiked for 16 Taiwanese college students to read, who had a required level of proficiency to skim spiked articles. Qualitative data about their reactions to the intertexts were drawn for analysis from semi-structured one-on-one interviews. In addition, the eight magazine articles were taught to 82 Taiwanese unknowing students without a required level of proficiency. A brief questionnaire was then conducted to probe into their motivations to learn intercultural intertexts. The results show that the interviewees generally felt positively about the intertexts and that most of the interviewees and questionnaire respondents were motivated to learn such intertexts. The findings indicate that it is not only theoretically but also practically worthwhile to inquire further into unknowing readers' responses to and interest in learning intercultural intertexts. © 2013 Taylor & Francis.","article titles; intercultural intertexts; intercultural literacy; sociocultural groups; Taiwanese unknowing readers; Western magazines",,,,,,"National Science Council, NSC: NSC 100-2410-H-160-008-MY2","The research carried out for the writing of this paper has been financed by Taiwan’s National Science Council (NSC 100-2410-H-160-008-MY2).",,,"Arroyo Vázquez, M.L., (2007) Approaching cultures through english, pp. 41-48. , In: Woodward Smith E., editors La Coruña, Spain,: Departamento de Filología Inglesa, Universidade da Coruña; Avruch, K., (1998) Culture and conflict resolution, , Washington, DC,: United States Institute of Peace Press; Barthes, R., (1977) Image, music, text, , New York,: The Noonday Press; Blum-Kulka, S., Blondheim, M., House, J., Kasper, G., Wagner, J., (2008) Unity and diversity of languages, pp. 155-173. , In: van Sterkenburg P., editors Amsterdam,: John Benjamins; Byram, M., (1997) Teaching and assessing intercultural communicative competence, , Clevedon,: Multilingual Matters; Clark, H.H., (1996) Using language, , Cambridge,: Cambridge University Press; Coperías Aguilar, M.J., (2008) Intercultural language use and language learning, pp. 59-78. , In: Alcón Soler E., Safont Jorda M.

This qualitative case study investigated the role of teacher communication in a short online project between language classes in secondary schools in Australia and China. Analysis of teacher interview data from the Australian school identifies, in the unequal participation across the two school contexts, that the core impacting factor was breakdown in teacher communication. This involved apparent conflict in pedagogic beliefs both across the two educational schema involved and also within the teacher's adaptation to her Australian context. This study provides evidence of the need to address both partners' pedagogic cultures and the development of new teacher skills, in the construction of a 'middle ground' in which online intercultural learning experience can be successful. © 2013 Taylor & Francis.","foreign language education; intercultural communication; online; pedagogy; teacher education",,,,,,,,,,"An, S., Kulm, G., Wu, Z., The pedagogical content knowledge of middle school, mathematics teachers in China and the U.S (2004) Journal of Mathematics Teacher Education, 7 (2), pp. 145-172; (2011) Shape of the Australian curriculum: Languages, , Australian Curriculum Assessment and Reporting Authority (ACARA), Sydney,: ACARA; (2005) Professional standards for accomplished teachers of languages and cultures, , Australian Federation of Modern Language Teachers Associations (AFMLTA), Canberra,: Commonwealth of Australia; Beijaard, D., Verloop, N., Vermunt, J.D., Teachers' perceptions of professional identity: An exploratory study from a personal knowledge perspective (2000) Teaching and Teacher Education, 16 (7), pp. 749-764; (2003) K-10 language syllabus: Chinese, , Board of Studies, NSW, Sydney,: Board of Studies NSW; Burnaby, B., Sun, Y., Chinese teachers' views of Western language teaching: Context informs paradigms (1989) TESOL Quarterly, 23 (2), pp. 219-238; Burns, A., Teacher beliefs and their influence on classroom practice (1992) Prospect, 7 (3), pp. 56-66; Byram, M., Gribkova, B., Starkey, H., (2002) Developing the intercultural dimension in language teaching.

Psycholinguistic and pragmatic studies have argued that cursing and swearing are a central component of an individual's communicative repertoire, fulfilling a variety of functions, including expressions of surprise, joy, frustration, anger and pain. Sociolinguistic studies not only confirm this but also highlight the taboo nature of these utterances, as well as the complex social and group constraints that dictate their usage. Given the central yet controversial status of cursing and swearing, it is hardly surprising that it is largely ignored in FLL, although strong arguments have been advanced in favour of teaching emotional language, which incorporates swearing. This paper will explore the possibilities for making cursing and swearing part of a foreign language curriculum, particularly for advanced learners, and will assess the role currently played by teaching materials. Given the marginalised function of cursing and swearing, and questions of interlanguage synonymy and equivalences, should the acquisition and understanding of cursing and swearing remain outside formal language learning, or do learners need to be made aware of the possibilities for emotional expression, making appropriate use of vulgar and taboo registers?. © 2013 Taylor & Francis.","cursing; emotional language; linguistic violence; swearing; taboo; vulgarism",,,,,,,,,,"Andersson, L., Trudgill, P., (1990) Bad language, , Oxford,: Blackwell; Battistella, E.L., (2005) Bad language.

I argue that the tolerance view of intercultural communication is patronising and does not prepare students for future roles in which they can impact upon the world. To realise their 'obligation to others' students need the freedom to imagine themselves in roles where they engage with others in responsible ways. Utilising sympathetic and dialogic imagination opens up spaces in the classroom where learners can frame their language learning as ethical intercultural engagements. Referring to a case study of an oral presentation task in a Dutch language class as part of a modern language degree, I show how students use their creativity, cosmopolitan perspectives and multiple voices to re-author themselves as ethical future professionals. © 2013 Taylor & Francis.","cosmopolitan perspectives; dialogic imagination; ethical intercultural engagements; heteroglossia; sympathetic imagination",,,,,,,,,,"Appiah, K.A., (2006) Cosmopolitanism: Ethics in a world of strangers, , London,: Penguin; Attinasi, J., Friedrich, P., (1994) The dialogic emergence of culture, pp. 33-53. , In: Mannheim B., Tedlock D., editors In, Urbana,: University of Illinois; Bakhtin, M., (1981) The dialogic imagination: Four essays, , In: Holquist M., editors In, Austin,: University of Texas Press; Bakhtin, M., (1986) Speech genres and other late essays, , Austin,: University of Texas Press; Beck, U., The cosmopolitan society and its enemies (2002) Theory, Culture & Society, 19 (1-2), pp. 17-44. , http://www.veraznanjemir.bos.rs/materijal/BECK_the_cosmopolitan_society_and_its_enemies.pdf, Retrieved from; Beck, U., (2006) Cosmopolitan vision, , Cambridge,: Polity Press; Carr, J., (1999) Striving for the third place: Intercultural competence through language education, pp. 103-112. , In: Lo Bianco J., Liddicoat A., Crozet C., editors In, Deakin,: The National Languages and Literacy Institute of Australia; (2001) Common European framework, , Council of Europe, Cambridge,: Cambridge University Press; Davies, B., (2000) A body of writing: 1990-1999, , Walnut Creek, CA,: Alta Mira; Kramsch, C., (1993) Context and culture in language teaching, , Oxford,: Oxford University Press; Lo Bianco, J., Liddicoat, A., Crozet, C., (1999) Striving for the third place: Intercultural competence through language education, , Deakin,: The National Languages and Literacy Institute of Australia; MacDonald, M.N., O'Regan, J.P., The ethics of intercultural communication (2012) Educational Philosophy and Theory; Roberts, C., Byram, M., Barro, A., Jordan, S., Street, B., (2001) Language learners as ethnographers, , Clevedon,: Multilingual Matters; Ros i Solé, C., Cosmopolitan speakers and the new cultural order (2013) The Language Learning Journal, 41 (3); Vitanova, G., (2005) Dialogue with Bakhtin on second and foreign language learning: New perspectives, , In: Hall J.

It is perhaps for this reason that positive feelings about language learning are rarely mentioned in the literature on language learning. The focus is predominantly on negative feelings: the anxiety caused by being asked to speak in the foreign language or the feelings of disempowerment when unable to call on familiar linguistic resources. To counterbalance this prevailing view of language learning, this paper reports on a study that investigated positive feelings about using foreign languages. The participants were an under-researched group of language users: adult first-language English speakers learning a foreign language for pleasure or using it in a social setting with other L1 English speakers. The findings showed that operating in the foreign language gave certain L2 users a sense of freedom and enabled them to speak and behave in ways that were different from their usual modes. Based on the findings of the empirical study, the paper suggests language teaching approaches that focus on types of performance that aim to offer learners a new experience of the world through another language. © 2013 Taylor & Francis.","emotions; feelings; individual differences; L2 use; personality traits",,,,,,,,,,"Besemeres, M., Different languages, different emotions?

Literature on MFL learning and emotions tends to focus on learners' emotions in relation to the production of the new language; however, MFL learning is also a space that provides the opportunity to language learners to construct different emotional experiences and negotiate different identities and different emotional stances towards their own or the target community and culture. What happens, though, when the language to be learnt is associated with a history of conflict and the dominant educational discourses construct emotional stances that perpetuate animosity towards the target community? And in this context, to what extent can language learning provide an opportunity to renegotiate a troubled past? Approaching emotions as socio-political discursive constructs, this paper examines classroom interaction during 32 h of Turkish language learning. It analyses (1) the students' emotional resistance towards a positive representation of the 'Others'; (2) the teacher's discomfort in adopting a positive stance towards the Turkish-speaking people; (3) the impact these two had on the lesson and classroom interaction. © 2013 Taylor & Francis.","conflict; emotion discourses; language education; peace; politics",,,,,,"Kingâs College London","4.

In this article I consider intercultural experience of language learning through the model of strangerhood, a concept first advanced by Simmel as a necessary marginality in society (the stranger as a social type) and later developed by Kristeva (drawing on Freud) as an internalised feature of late modern individuals which requires us to live with the ambivalence of different subject positions, each of us carrying strangerhood within us. A key but under-examined aspect in the development of intercultural competence is understanding our own (inter)subjective predispositions which we bring to intercultural encounters, and how these mediate our sense of belonging or, conversely, of alienation, a major trope of narratives of mobility and language learning. Presenting extracts from language learners' autobiographical data I examine how individuals position themselves as strangers, set apart from the mainstream, and how this trope constructs narrative worlds of outsiderness. Autobiographical narration offers a discursive space for developing our understanding of the social world, with the potential to take us beyond realist descriptions towards an enquiry into how language and place are symbolically appropriated in our lives. Sociological frames (e.g. as proposed by Bourdieu or Wenger) have extended our understanding of inequity and assumptions of power in intercultural settings and this paper contributes further by proposing strangerhood as a psychological disposition requiring language learners to observe beyond themselves while also apprehending one's own image as this refracts and changes shape through the lens of others. © 2013 Taylor & Francis.","autobiography; intercultural; narrative; subjectivity; Unheimliche",,,,,,,,,,"Abdallah-Pretceille, A., (1986) Vers une pédagogie interculturelle, , Paris,: Presses Universitaires de France; Bauman, Z., Some thoughts on exile and thinking in exile (1997) Acta Sueco-Polonica, 6, pp. 157-160; Baynham, M., De Fina, A., (2005) Dislocations/relocations: Narratives of displacement, , Manchester,: St. Jerome; Becker, H.S., (1963) Outsiders: Studies in the sociology of deviance, , Glencoe, IL,: Free Press; Besemeres, M., (2004) Border crossings: Mapping identities in Modern Europe, pp. 125-143. , In: Wagstaff P., editors Oxford/Bern,: Peter Lang; Bruner, J., The narrative construction of reality (1991) Critical Inquiry, 18, pp. 1-21; Bruner, J., (2001) Narrative and identity: Studies in autobiography, self and culture, pp. 25-37. , In: Brockmeier J., Carbaugh D., editors Amsterdam & Philadelphia,: John Benjamins; Byram, M., (1997) Teaching and assessing intercultural communicative competence, , Clevedon,: Multilingual Matters; Coffey, S., Becoming a francophile: Stories of Frenchness (2010) Language and Intercultural Communication, 10 (2), pp. 119-136; Coffey, S., (2011) Mobility and localisation in language learning, pp. 51-77. , In: Fenoulhet J., Rosi Sole C., editors Oxford & NY,: Peter Lang; Coffey, S., Narrative research in applied linguistics, , In: Barkhuizen G., editors in press, Cambridge, MA,: Cambridge University Press (Applied Linguistics Series); Coffey, S., Street, B., Narrative and identity in the language learning project (2008) Modern Language Journal, 92 (3), pp. 452-464; (2000) Common European Framework of Reference for Languages, , http://www.coe.int/t/dg4/linguistic/Source/Framework_EN.pdf, Retrieved from; DuFon, M., Churchill, E., (2006) Language learners in study abroad contexts, , Clevedon,: Multilingual Matters; Freud, S., (1985) Sigmund Freud, art and literature (The Pelican Freud Library vol. 14), pp. 335-376. , In: Dickson A., editors Harmondsworth,: Penguin; Goffman, E., (1967) Interactional ritual: Essays on face to face behavior, , New York, NY,: Pantheon; Hall, S., (1995) Identity, authority and democracy: Research papers in media and cultural studies.

This line of research exits from the notion that tests are not isolated events but rather powerful societal tools that are both driven by, and have impact on, ideology, politics, education, and economics. This power also emerges from the discourse of testing, where testers pose questions and assign tasks that the test takers are expected to react to by providing answers and engaging in performances that match these demands. It is this discourse of power that enables the delivery of messages about preferred languages and policies and delegitimacy and marginalization of others. This paper describes three such cases: (1) language tests for citizenship for adult immigrants; (2) national tests for measuring academic achievements of immigrants in schools; and (3) international comparative tests. In each of these widely used tests, language realities are being manipulated towards perpetuating language ideologies that stand in stark contrast to diversity multilingual identities and cultures in various contexts - regional, national, global, and transnational. The paper shows how test takers surrender to the demands of tests, accept the testing discourse as 'the truth,' and comply with it. Proposals are made for the adoption of different types of tests that better reflect multilingual realities. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","identities; immigration; power; proficiency; testing; transnational",,,,,,,,,,"Bourdieu, P., (1991) Language and symbolic power, , Cambridge, MA, Cambridge, MA,: Harvard University Press; Brown, A., McNamara, T., ""The devil is in the detail"": Researching gender issues in language assessment (2004) TESOL Quarterly, 38, pp. 524-538; Canagarajah, S., Changing communicative needs: Revised assessment objectives, testing English as an international language (2006) Language Assessment Quarterly, 3, pp. 229-242; Cheng, L., Washback, impact and consequences (2008) Encyclopedia of language and education, pp. 349-364. , In: Shohamy E., Hornberger N., editors 2nd ed., Berlin, Berlin,: Springer; Creese, A., Blackledge, A., Translanguaging in the bilingual classroom: A pedagogy for learning and teaching?

Quite often identity formation is not perceived as a dynamic and interactive ongoing process that engages other cultures and involves change in its responses to different challenges at different times. I will contend in the paper that such a static and ahistorical approach to cultural identity and cultural differences is common in the intercultural communication context of English language learning, where native and non-native speakers each assume a set of definitive features serving to show their distinctiveness from each other. Intercultural communication, based on such putative differences, is thus reduced to a process of cultural othering, with non-native English speakers being othered as something non-essential or peripheral. I will demonstrate the point through a diachronic discussion of the Chinese and the English politeness norms relating to hospitality by reexamining the data from V. Chen's and R. Chen's studies, and comparing them with the travelogues by Rochefoucauld, Taine, and others. My claim is that it is not the alleged inherent attributes, but the external challenges a culture confronts at a time that determine the pattern of hospitality. With no intention to deny differences in discursive cultural identities, I will call for a more open-minded historical approach, crediting rather than discrediting changes and interactions. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","dehistoricized cultural identity; impositional hospitality; othering",,,,,,,,,,"Benedict, R., (1934) Patterns of culture, , New York, NY, New York, NY,: Mariner Books; Bond, M.H., (1991) Beyond the Chinese face: Insights from psychology, , Oxford, Oxford,: Oxford University Press; Botsford, J.B., (1924) English society in the eighteenth century: As influenced from overseas, , New York, NY, New York, NY,: The MacMillan; Brown, P., Levinson, S.C., (1987) Politeness: Some universals in language usage, , Cambridge, Cambridge,: Cambridge University Press; Bryson, A., (1998) From courtesy to civility: Changing codes of conduct in early modern England, , Oxford, Oxford,: Oxford University Press; World-beating Chinese hospitality (2011), http://my.telegraph.co.uk/expat/chelsea_girl_in_china/10141473/world-beating-chinese-hospitality/, Chelsea The telegraph.

These themes and issues are empirically rich areas of investigation for discourse and identity studies. For example, despite its widespread use and exposure, English varies from one region to another with regard to how it is learned and used in day-to-day life and the social significance it has with families and communities. The present study investigates the identity work that takes place when interactants from different parts of the world come together and communicate in English. Specifically, this study uses membership categorization analysis to examine English as a lingua franca (ELF) encounters. Data come from a large corpus of multi-party voice-based chat rooms and the Vienna-Oxford International Corpus of English. The analysis focuses on how interactants give, and respond to, compliments concerning language proficiency. The paper aims to show how compliment sequences provide a window into how identities are co-constructed in intercultural, lingua franca encounters. Observations reveal that compliment sequences often lead to orientations of so-called 'non-native' identities, and highlight the fluid and dynamic nature of discourse identity invocation and co-construction during ELF encounters. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","compliments; English as a lingua franca; identity; language proficiency; membership categorization",,,,,,,,,,"Antaki, C., Widdicombe, S., (1998) Identities in talk, , Thousand Oaks, CA, Thousand Oaks, CA,: Sage; Atkinson, J.M., Heritage, J., (1984) Structures of social action: Studies in conversation analysis, , Cambridge, Cambridge,: Cambridge University Press; Augé, M., (2009) Non-places: Introduction to an anthropology of supermodernity, , New York, New York,: Verso; Baker, W., The cultures of English as a lingua franca (2009) TESOL Quarterly, 43 (4), pp. 567-592; Baker, W., Language, culture and identity through English as a lingua franca in Asia: Notes from the field (2009) The Linguistics Journal, pp. 8-35. , http://www.linguistics-journal.com/September-2009.pdf, Retrieved from; Bjørge, A.K., Power distance in English lingua franca email communication (2007) International Journal of Applied Linguistics, 17 (1), pp. 60-80; Block, D., (2007) Second language identities, , London, London,: Continuum; Bolton, K., World Englishes (2004) The handbook of applied linguistics, pp. 369-396. , In: Davies A., Elder C., editors Oxford, UK, Oxford,: Blackwell; Boyle, R., Whatever happened to preference organisation?

This paper briefly examines the history of the 'native speaker' and the shifts in thinking that gave the concept an intuitive validity, before turning to current instances of linguistic/discursive othering, starting with the reporting in UK newspapers of the spread of grey squirrels and calls to wipe them out in order to save the 'native' red squirrel. Themes from this discussion are found to recur in an analysis of three texts from the SCOTS Corpus, assembled at the University of Glasgow. In these texts, various forms of othering are observed in the discourse of(1) a group of Gaelic teachers remarking on the differences between their island Gaelic and that of their urban students; (2) a Shetland woman shifting her identity as the conversational frame shifts from Britain to Scotland to Shetland school to Shetland farm; (3) a group of young Glaswegians recalling their own othering in excursions to England (which doesn't prevent them from othering others).Intriguingly, in the course of discursively turning his gay neighbours into an alien species in a way that echoes the exterminationist line on grey squirrels, a speaker in (3) gives off some quite unexpected 'indices' - which leads finally to the methodological questions which indexicality raises in terms of intention and interpretation. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","discourse analysis; identity; national; othering",,,,,,,,,,"Agha, A., The social life of cultural value (2003) Language & Communication, 23, pp. 231-273; Agha, A., (2007) Language and social relations, , Cambridge, Cambridge,: Cambridge University Press; Bergmann, J.R., (1993) Discreet indiscretions: The social organization of gossip, , New York, New York,: Aldine de Gruyter; Besnier, N., Information withholding as a manipulative and collusive strategy in Nukulaelae gossip (1989) Language in Society, 18, pp. 315-341; Blommaert, J., Sociolinguistics and discourse analysis: Orders of indexicality and polycentricity (2007) Journal of Multicultural Discourses, 2, pp. 115-130; Bourdieu, P., (1991) Language and symbolic power: The economy of linguistic exchanges, , In: Thompson John B., editors G.

Most adopt a broadly poststructuralist approach, drawing on the work of social theorists working in a wide range of areas such as cultural studies, gender studies and critical theory. However, the complexity of these sources poses challenges for these researchers and the aim of this paper is to discuss one such challenge: the theoretical tension between structure and agency, a tension often mentioned but seldom explored in depth. First, I examine how identity, structure and agency might be defined. Second, I then embark on a selective discussion of how structure and agency have been framed by key thinkers in the social sciences, ranging from Karl Marx to Ulrich Beck, Anthony Giddens and Pierre Bourdieu. Third, I examine the work of Margaret Archer, who has explicitly and deliberately taken on the dilemma of structure and agency and developed a suggestive way of thinking about the interrelationship between the two. Finally, I end with a consideration of how my fellow contributors to this special issue of Language and Intercultural Communication have incorporated structure and agency into their papers, followed by suggestions of how language and intercultural communication researchers interested in problematising structure and agency might proceed in the future. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","agency; culture; identity; intercultural; structure",,,,,,,,,,"Ahearn, L., Language and agency (2001) Annual Review of Anthropology, 30, pp. 109-137; Appadurai, A., Disjuncture and difference in the global cultural economy (1990) Global culture: Nationalism, globalization and modernity, pp. 295-310. , In: Featherstone M., editors London, London,: Sage; Archer, M., (1995) Realist social theory: The morphogentic approach, , Cambridge, Cambridge,: Cambridge University Press; Archer, M., (2000) Being human: The problem of agency, , Cambridge, Cambridge,: Cambridge University Press; Archer, M., (2007) Making our way through the world, , Cambridge, Cambridge,: Cambridge University Press; Archer, M., Morphogenesis versus structuration: On combining structure and action (2010) British Journal Of Sociology, 61, pp. 225-252. , (Re-print in 60th Birthday Issue of British Journal of Sociology); Bakewell, O., Some reflections on structure and agency in migration theory (2010) Journal of Ethnic and Migration Studies, 36 (10), pp. 1689-1708; Basch, L., Glick Schiller, N., Szanton-Blanc, C., (1994) Nations unbound: Transnational projects, postcolonial predicaments, and deterritorialized nation states, , Langhorne, PA, Langhorne, PA,: Gordon and Breach; Beck, U., (1992) The risk society, , London, London,: Sage; Beck, U., (1997) The reinvention of politics, , Cambridge, Cambridge,: Polity; Beck, U., Beck-Gernsheim, E., (2002) Individualization, , London, London,: Sage; Bendle, M., The crisis of identity in high modernity (2002) British Journal of Sociology, 53 (1), pp. 1-18; Bhaskar, R., (1998) The possibility of naturalism, , 3rd ed., London, London,: Routledge; Block, D., (2006) Multilingual identities in a global city: London stories, , London, London,: Palgrave; Block, D., The rise of identity in SLA research, post Firth and Wagner (1997) (2007) The Modern Language Journal, 91 (5), pp. 863-876. , http://www.jstor.org/stable/4626137, Retrieved from; Block, D., (2007) Second language identities, , London, London,: Continuum; Block, D., Identity in applied linguistics: The need for conceptual exploration (2009) Contemporary applied linguistics, 1, pp. 215-232. , In:, In: Wei L., editorsCook V., editors In, London, London,: Continuum; Block, D., Commentary: Transnational South Korea as a site for a sociolinguistics and the distinction of global elites (2012) Journal of Sociolinguistics, 16 (2), pp. 277-282; Block, D., Gray, J., Holborow, M., (2012) Neoliberalism and applied linguistics, , London, London,: Routledge; Blommaert, J., (2010) The sociolinguistics of globalization, , Cambridge, Cambridge,: Cambridge University Press, Clevedon, UK: Multilingual Matters; Bourdieu, P., (1977) Outline of a theory of practice, , Cambridge, Cambridge,: Cambridge University Press; Bourdieu, P., (2000) Pascalian meditations, , Stanford, CA, Stanford, CA,: Stanford University Press; Bourdieu, P., (2003) Fighting back: Against tyranny of the Market 2, , London, London,: Verso; Bourdieu, P., (2004) Science of science and reflexivity, , Cambridge, Cambridge,: Polity; Bourdieu, P., (2005) The social structures of the economy, , Cambridge, Cambridge,: Polity; Bucholtz, M., Hall, K., Identity and interaction: A sociocultural linguistic approach (2005) Discourse Studies, 7 (4-5), pp. 585-614; Caldas-Coulthard, C.R., Iedema, R., (2008) Identity trouble: Critical discourse and contested identities, , London, London,: Palgrave; Corson, D., Critical realism: An emancipatory philosophy for applied linguistics?

Scales enable us to address the portability of semiotic resources in migration with great insight. In addition, unlike romanticized orientations to globalization and transnational relations, this model enables us to address the role of power in shaping the uptake of resources in shifting social contexts. Sociolinguists in this tradition show how the resources that enjoy power and prestige in certain local contexts receive lower status as migrants move to other social contexts, especially in Western urban communities. Despite the usefulness of this orientation, the sociolinguistics of scale suffers from certain limitations. It presents a highly stratified vision of social spaces, ignoring the possibility for renegotiating status differences and hierarchies. It assumes a normative orientation to languages, unable to accommodate the possibility that new language norms and practices might emerge, leading to new orders of indexicality. For these reasons, it is also insensitive to agency in mobility, unable to theorize how migrants may renegotiate norms in elite and privileged contexts. I present interview data from African skilled migrants in the UK, USA, and Australia to demonstrate their attitudes toward renegotiating the valuation and status of their own varieties of English in transnational contexts. Their narratives suggest how migrants negotiate spatiotemporal scales to their advantage, redefine the translocal space, and reconstruct new orders of indexicality in intercultural communication. Though I lack interactional data to examine uptake, the interview data helps develop a more complex use of scalar metaphors to address the dynamics of agency and inequality in intercultural communication in translocal spaces. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","agency; intercultural; power; scales; sociolinguistics",,,,,,,,,,"Adsera, A., Pytlikova, M., (2010) The role of language in shaping international migration: Evidence from OECD countries 1985-2006, , www.cepr.org/meets/wkcn/2/2429/papers/Adserafinal.pdf, Retrieved February 24, 2011, from; Atkinson, D., Contrasting rhetorics/contrasting cultures: Why contrastive rhetoric needs a better conceptualization of culture (2004) Journal of English for Academic Purposes, 3, pp. 277-289; Bleakley, H., Chin, A., Language skills and earnings: Evidence from childhood immigrants (2004) Review of Economics and Statistics, 84 (2), pp. 481-496; Blommaert, J., (2005) Discourse: A critical introduction, , Cambridge, UK, Cambridge,: Cambridge University press; Blommaert, J., (2010) The sociolinguistics of globalization, , Cambridge, Cambridge,: Cambridge University press; Canagarajah, A.S., Lingua franca English, multilingual communities, and language acquisition (2007) Modern Language Journal, 91 (5), pp. 921-937; Chiswick, B.R., Miller, P.W., The endogeneity between language and earnings (1995) Journal of Labour Economics, 13 (2), pp. 246-288; Chiswick, B.R., Miller, P.W., Immigrant earnings: Language skills, linguistic concentrations and the business cycle (2002) Journal of Population Economics, 15 (1), pp. 31-57; Chiswick, B.R., Miller, P.W., (2007) The international transferability of immigrants' human capital skills, , http://repec.iza.org/RePEc/Discussionpaper/dp2670.pdf, IZA Discussion Papers 2670, Institute for the Study of Labor (IZA), Retrieved February 20, 2011, from; Collins, J., Baynham, M., Slembrouck, S., (2009) Globalization and language in contact: Scale, migration, and communicative practices, , London, London,: Continuum; Connor, U., Mapping multidimensional aspects of research: Reaching to intercultural rhetoric (2008) Contrastive rhetoric: Reaching to intercultural rhetoric, pp. 299-316. , In: Connor U., Nagelhout E., Rozycki W., editors Amsterdam, Amsterdam,: John Benjamins; de Certeau, M., (1984) The practice of everyday life, , (S.

The first is that of the preferred language choice of the retirees. To collect data for language choice a self-report questionnaire was administered and an interview was conducted. The findings suggest that the majority of the retirees chose English for both informal and formal interactions in Malaysia. It may be inferred that they are not motivated to learn the local language although quite clearly that would facilitate intercultural communication with the locals. Based on these findings we examine the ethical considerations underlying their language preferences. We assume that they have positioned themselves as sojourners who have come to reside in Malaysia principally to enjoy their retirement, rather than as settlers. We have named this unique situation - contemplation - based on an observation of their emotional adaptation to the new environment since their personal needs are taken care of by Japanese agents or by locating a 'little Japan' in Malaysia for themselves. The MM2H programme hosted by the Malaysian government focuses on economic aspects of the partnership and does not seek to provide intercultural opportunities or benefits which implicate issues of ethics and equity. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","cultural behaviour; ethical consideration; Japanese retirees; language choice; Malaysia",,,,,,,,,,"Ahmed, A., Belonging out of context: The intersection of place, networks and ethnic identity among retired British migrants in the Costa Blanca (2011) Journal of Identity and Migration Studies, 5 (2), pp. 2-19; (2010) European workers want to retire abroad... and ideally to the sun, , http://aon.mediaroom.com/index.php?s=43&item=1987, AON Retrieved December 7, 2010, from; Berry, J.W., Immigration, acculturation and adaptation (1997) Applied Psychology: An International Review, 46, pp. 5-34; Bradley, D., Bradley, M., (2002) Language endangerment and language maintenance, , London, London,: Routledge Curzon; Chibocos, T.R., Leite, R.W., Weis, D.L., (2005) Readings in family theory, , Thousand Oaks, CA, Thousand Oaks, CA,: Sage; Crystal, D., (2003) English as a global language, , 2nd ed., Cambridge, Cambridge,: Cambridge University Press; Degefa, A., (2004) Criteria for language choice in multilingual societies: An appraisal of Ethiopian language choice at the Federal level, , January, IACL, Santiago de Chile; Dumanig, F., (2007) Analysis on the language choice and marital typology of South-East Asian couples, , July, 2nd Singapore Graduate Forum on Southeast Asia Studies; Fasold, R., (1990) The sociolinguistics of language, , Oxford, Oxford,: Blackwell; Ferrer, R., Sankoff, D., Transmission, education and integration in projections of language shift in Valencia (2004) Language Policy, 3, pp. 107-131; Foo, B., Richards, C., English in Malaysia (2004) RELC Journal, 35, pp. 229-240; Gal, S., (1979) Language shift: Social determinants of linguistic change in bilingual Australia, , New York, New York,: Academic Press; Ip, D., Wu, C.T., Inglis, C., Settlement experiences of Taiwanese immigrants in Australia (1998) Asian Studies Review, 22, pp. 79-97; Johansson, S., (1991) Language use in mixed marriage, , http://hem.hj.se/~lsj/bl/bl.pdf, Retrieved June 17, 2005, from; Kaur, K., Why they need English in Malaysia: A survey (1995) World Englishes, 14, pp. 223-230; Kawahara, M., Adaptive strategy of Japanese senior long-term stayers and local community responses in Chiangmai (2010) The Journal of Thai Studies, 10, pp. 35-55; King, R., Warnes, T., Williams, A., (2000) Sunset lives?: British retirement migration to the Mediterranean, , Oxford, Oxford,: Berg; Koike, I., A comparative view of English - Teaching policies in an international world with a focus on Japanese TEFL policy (1993) Georgetown University Roundtable on Languages and Linguistics, pp. 275-284. , In, Washington, DC, Washington, DC,: Georgetown University Press; Kubo, T., Ishikawa, Y., Searching for 'paradise': Japanese international retirement migration (2004) Japanese Journal of Human Geography, 56 (3), pp. 74-87; Lambek, M., Value and virtue (2008) Anthropological Theory, 8, pp. 133-157; (1994) Three generations, two languages, one family.

Although the literature characterizes these interactions as English as a lingua franca, this paper explores to what extent interactants see themselves as lingua franca speakers. Membership categorization analysis is used to investigate how social categories related to English are enacted in, and through, talk and interaction. This is done by investigating language proficiency compliments, talk of language proficiency, and getting acquainted sequences. While English is the medium of communication in these chat rooms, the findings reveal that English as a lingua franca is not a social category that is made relevant during talk. When constructing identities in relation to English, the social categories that are made relevant are foreigner, language learner, and non-native. These observations are then used to argue that an equitable, impartial, and context-sensitive approach to examining identities in intercultural communication requires abandoning the more traditional method of ascribing social categories a priori. The paper ends by exploring the validity of using the term English as a lingua franca when interactants possess, and make relevant, a number of different social categories when speaking in English. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","ELF; equity; ethics; identity; online interaction; social categories",,,,,,,,,,"Antaki, C., Widdicombe, S., (1998) Identities in talk, , London, London,: Sage; Atkinson, J.M., Heritage, J., (1984) Structures of social action: Studies in conversation analysis, , Cambridge, Cambridge,: Cambridge University Press; Baker, W., The cultures of English as a lingua franca (2009) TESOL Quarterly, 43 (4), pp. 567-592; Benwell, B., Stokoe, E., (2006) Discourse and identity, , Edinburgh, Edinburgh,: Edinburgh University Press; Brandt, A., Jenks, C.J., Is it okay to eat a dog in Korea... like China?'

The narratives provide evidence that FDHs appear to be untouched by the ethics and equity of Hong Kong society. They are denied the rights that apply to other groups: the right to eat, rest and talk; they are humiliated and denigrated, and the analyses show that this treatment may affect their self-perception. The paper considers local stereotypes and ideological representations as a possible cause for legitimising the exploitation of FDHs, and it recommends that researchers become engaged in social activism in the attempt to help FDHs rewrite their narratives of repression. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","depersonalisation and dehumanisation; foreign domestic helpers; moral exclusion; narratives",,,,,,,"The research reported in the paper was supported by a research grant from the University Grants Committee of Hong Kong.

Today, anthropologists are interested in understanding specific local and indigenous conceptions of human relatedness - how the biological and social converge to make different constructions and experiences of kinship. This paper extends that examination to the contemporary Hmong who came as refugees to Texas and Gammertingen, Germany, examining the ways connections and disconnections of relatedness have come to be understood not only in terms of blood and clan, but also in terms of dialect. This paper theoretically situates the Hmong idea of kinship in these two localities as a reintegration of the more descent-centered Freedmanian model and one of the more modern models that include dialect variation in lineage. © 2013 Taylor & Francis.","clan; Hmong; Hmong in Germany; Hmong in Texas; kinship; language; refugees",,,,,,,,,,"Aikhenvald, A., (2002) Language contact in Amazonia, , Oxford,: Oxford University Press; Aikhenvald, A.Y., Multilingualism and ethnic stereotypes: The Tariana of northwest Amazonia (2003) Language in Society, 32 (1), pp. 1-21; Barth, F., (1969) Ethnic groups and boundaries: The social organization of culture difference, , Boston,: Little, Brown; Bertrais, Y., (1964) Dictionnaire hmong-francÌ§ais, , Sangwan,: Surasarang; Carsten, J., (2000) Cultures of relatedness: New approaches to the study of kinship, , Cambridge,: Cambridge University Press; Cooper, R., (1984) Resource scarcity and the Hmong response, , Singapore,: Singapore University Press; Culas, C., Michaud, J., (2004) Hmong/Miao in Asia, pp. 61-96. , In: Tapp N., Michaud J., Culas C., Lee G.

The cross-cultural examination of the use of linguistic resources for signalling 'social role, boundaries and bonds' (Chilton, P., Analysing Political Discourse: Theory and Practice. London: Routledge, 2004, p. 48) serves to explore how speakers use language strategically to position themselves and others, renegotiate or resist positioning, offer rallying points and forge 'defensible alignments' (Goffman, E., Forms of Talk. Oxford: Basil Blackwell, 1981, p. 325). In the case of personal deixis, it shows that both quantitative and qualitative methods can be used to pinpoint cultural specificities - for example, a more frequent use of explicit performatives in the Spanish and, particularly, the French data to hedge commitment to propositions, and, in English-language parliamentary debate, a use of truth hedging signalling strong commitment for coercive interactive positioning. In the case of indeterminacy of reference, in, for example, the use of 'asides', in the English-language editorial meeting humour was used to bond participants in the pursuit of common goals; cultural allusion and references in Latin and English were used in the Spanish parliament for positioning; verbal wit and virtuosity were particularly important in the community of practice of the French parliament. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","cross-cultural; English; French; identity; interaction; Spanish; workplace",,,,,,,,,,"(2007) Assemblée Nationale, XIII e législature, Session ordinaire de 2008-2009.

It is often assumed that because of this it can facilitate intercultural communication and reduce the perceived distance between cultures. This article will examine this assumption by exploring two questions. Firstly, do the characteristics of computer-mediated communication (anonymity, absence of visual cues, etc.) facilitate intercultural communication and reduce distance and misunderstandings, or do they increase disparity between cultures and reinforce cultural stereotypes? Secondly, does the internet favour cultural globalization or cultural variation? Through several examples and case studies, two contrasting tendencies will be identified. The internet can favour cultural standardization, for example, through netiquette - a set of communicative rules which reflect a certain North American communicative style. However, cyberspace can also reinforce cultural variation, especially when the internet is used by diasporas. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","cultural variation; globalization; intercultural communication; internet; netiquette",,,,,,,,,,"Anderson, J.W., Cybernauts of the Arab diaspora: Electronic mediation in transnational cultural identities (1997) Couch-Stone Symposium 'Postmodern Culture, Global Capitalism and Democratic Action, , http://www.irfanerdogan.com/globalization/globalca.html, April 10-12, In, University of Maryland.

These subtitling agencies are often part of a movement of cultural resistance against global capitalist structures and institutions, whether for aesthetic or political reasons. This article gauges the extent to which participatory subtitling challenges assumptions underpinning traditional scholarship on intercultural communication, as instantiated in the pragmatics of audio-visual translation. It is argued that affectivity emerges as a powerful non-representational force behind amateur mediation. Rather than simply aiming to deliver 'accurate' representations of the source text meaning, amateur subtitles seek to performatively intervene in the articulation and reception of the audio-visual semiotic ensemble. Drawing on selected examples of aesthetic and political subtitling activism, this article examines the relevance of non-representational theory, originally developed within the field of human geography, to the study of the expressive or transformational role of amateur subtitling. It is suggested that the epistemological and political dimensions of this non-representational phenomenon are symptomatic of a wider trend towards a radical model of democracy. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","activism; affectivity; amateur subtitling; digital participatory culture; fansubbing; pragmatics",,,,,,,,,,"Aitken, S., Dixon, D.P., Imagining geographies of film (2006) Erdkunde: Archiv für Wissenschaftliche Geographie, 60, pp. 326-336; Appadurai, A., Disjuncture and difference in the global cultural economy (1990) Public Culture, 2 (2), pp. 1-24; Baker, M., Translation and activism: Emerging patterns of narrative community (2006) The Massachusetts Review, 47 (III), pp. 462-484; Baker, M., (2006) Translation and conflict: A narrative account, , London, London,: Routledge; Baker, M., Resisting state terror: Theorising communities of activist translators and interpreters (2009) Globalisation, political violence and translation, pp. 222-242. , In: Bielsa Mialet E., Hughes C., editors Basingstoke, Basingstoke,: Palgrave Macmillan; Baker, M., Translation as an alternative space for political action (2012) Social Movement Studies: Journal of Social, Cultural and Political Protest; Baker, M., Translation and interpreting studies A companion to translation studies, , In:, In: Berman S., editorsPorter C., editors in press, In, London, London,: Wiley-Blackwell; Banks, J., Deuze, M., Co-creative labour (2009) International Journal of Cultural Studies, 12, pp. 419-431; Barra, L., The mediation is the message: Italian regionalization of US TV series as co-creational work (2009) International Journal of Cultural Studies, 12 (5), pp. 509-525; Brown, P., Levinson, S., Excerpted as Politeness: Some universals in language usage (1987) The discourse reader, pp. 321-335. , In:, In: Jaworski A., editorsCoupland N., editors Politeness.

Social Semiotics distinguishes between 'society' and 'culture'. 'The social' is the domain of interaction seen as semiotic work, organized in fields of power. 'Culture' is the repository of semiotic resources, of material and non-material kinds, produced in social action. The resources are constantly drawn back into use in social action, and there they are constantly remade. A 'culture' therefore is the repository of resources jointly made in social interaction; a 'society' is the group that works jointly with resources previously made by the group: with its purposes, aware of the potentials, meanings, affordances and constraints of the resources/tools used by those who do the semiotic work. Work happens in 'sites'; those working in a site understand its meanings and its resources. Work done over time leads to (a degree at least) of 'recognizability' by others in the community, a certain 'conventionality' of what is going on, and hence leads to the possibility of a relative recognition of the resources: whether as values, meanings, knowledge, practices. The article explores these propositions in their relation to 'culture' and 'the cross-cultural', via a series of examples drawn from research. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","cross-cultural communication; interest; multimodal representation; recognition; sign-making; Social Semiotics",,,,,,"Stockholms Universitet, SU","The research project ‘‘Museums, Exhibitions and Visitors: Meaning-Making in a New Arena for Learning and Communication’’ was funded by the Swedish National Research Foundation, with Professor Staffan Selander (Stockholm University) as Director and Professor Gunther Kress (Institute of Education, London) as Co-Director.",,,"Bezemer, J., Cope, A., Kress, G., Kneebone, R., Do you have another Johan?'

The Square is well known as a market for informal traders (mainly from other parts of Africa), local people and tourists from all over the world. Using originally collected discursive evidence from market traders, the particular focus of this paper is to show how two groups of traders in the market - South Africans and Africans from other countries, respectively - discursively construct each other. By taking a critical discourse analysis (CDA) approach to transcribed interviews conducted with traders from both groups, we were able to extract discursive constructions of 'the Other', which revealed considerable intergroup stereotypes, intra-continental racism and xenophobia. The paper considers the causes of these discursive constructions, such as dominant ideologies, the dominant political discourses emanating from the South African state itself as argued by Neocosmos in 2008, and the spaces (real and imagined) in which these different actors find themselves. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","Cape Town; critical discourse analysis; informal traders; intercultural communication; migration; national identity; South Africa; space; xenophobia",,,,,,,,,,"Adhikari, M., (2009) Burdened by race: Coloured identities in Southern Africa, , Cape Town: UCT Press; Alexander, N., We'll pay the price for race cowardice (2010) The Cape Times, p. 11; Altarriba, J., Cognitive approaches to the study of emotion-laden and emotion words in monolingual and bilingual memory (2006) Bilingual minds: Emotional experience, expression and representation, , In: Pavlenko A., editors Clevedon: Multilingual Matters; Bailey, C., Hundreds take to city streets against attacks (2008) The Cape Argus, pp. 1-2; Besteman, C., (2008) Transforming Cape Town, , Berkeley: University of California Press; Blommaert, J., (2010) A sociolinguistics of globalization, , Cambridge: Cambridge University Press; Blommaert, J., Collins, J., Slembrouck, S., Spaces of multilingualism (2005) Language and Communication, 25 (3), pp. 197-216; Chilton, P., Missing links in mainstream CDA: Modules, blends and the critical instinct (2005) A new agenda in (critical) discourse analysis, pp. 19-52. , In: Wodak R., Chilton P., editors Amsterdam and Philadelphia: John Benjamins; de Cillia, R., Reisigl, M., Wodak, R., The discursive construction of national identities (1999) Discourse and Society, 10, pp. 149-173; Deumert, A., Masinyana, S.O., Mobile language choices - The use of English and isiXhosa in text messages (SMS): Evidence from a bilingual South African sample (2008) English Worldwide, 29 (2), pp. 117-147; Dyers, C., Truncated multilingualism or language shift?

From this, students are seen to construct generalisations about the host culture which the module fails to address despite claims to the development of intercultural competence. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","British Studies; factual information; intercultural competence; international students",,,,,,,,,,"Arnold, M., (1960) Culture and anarchy, , Cambridge: Cambridge University Press; Bassnett, S., Teaching British Cultural Studies: Reflections on the way and the how (1994) Journal for the Study of British Cultures, 1 (1), pp. 63-74; Bassnett, S., Introduction: Studying British cultures (1997) Studying British cultures, pp. xiii-xxvii. , In: Bassnett S., editors London: Routledge In; Bennett, M.J., Towards ethnorelativism: A developmental model of intercultural sensitivity (1993) Education for the intercultural experience, pp. 21-71. , In: Paige R.M., editors Yarmouth: Intercultural Press; Berg, S., British/Cultural Studies made in Germany: Attempts at understanding another nation state (2001) Journal of Contemporary European Studies, 9 (2), pp. 233-242; (2009) Accreditation UK handbook, , London: British Council, British Council; Brumfit, C., (1994) British Cultural Studies: Some educational concerns, , Southampton: University of Southampton, School of Education Occasional Papers No. 29; Brumfit, C., British Studies: An educational perspective (1997) Studying British cultures, pp. 41-55. , In: Bassnett S., editors London: Routledge; Burslem, A., (2004) International students in UK universities and colleges: Broadening our horizons, , London: UKCOSA; Byram, M., Cultural Studies and foreign language teaching (1997) Studying British cultures, pp. 56-67. , In: Bassnett S., editors London: Routledge; Byram, M., (1997) Teaching and assessing intercultural communicative competence, , Clevedon: Multilingual Matters; Byram, M., On being 'bicultural' and 'intercultural (2003) Intercultural experience and education, pp. 50-66. , In: Alred G., Byram M., Fleming M., editors Clevedon: Multilingual Matters; Byram, M., (2008) From foreign language education to education for intercultural citizenship, , Clevedon: Multilingual Matters; Byram, M., Zarate, G., (1997) The sociocultural and intercultural dimension of language learning and teaching, , Strasbourg: Council of Europe; Carspecken, P.F., (1996) Critical ethnography in educational research: A theoretical and practical guide, , London: Routledge; Clarke, J., Clarke, M., Stereotyping in TESOL materials (1990) Culture and the language classroom, pp. 31-44. , In: Harrison B., editors London: Modern English Publications/British Council; Corbett, C., Genre analysis and British Studies now!

Adolescents in the mixed city, although more exposed to Hebrew and to Jewish culture, develop a stronger sense of 'Arab' identity than adolescents in the Arab town, who use Hebrew less but have a lower sense of aversion toward it and a weaker 'Arab' identity. The findings highlight the strong association between language and identity and the ambivalence involved in language use in conflictual contexts, contributing to the understanding of language as a mirror of individual dynamics and intergroup relations. The study suggests implications for the local conflict and for adolescents growing up in conflictual contexts in general, as well as the reflection of these conflicts on social, psychological, and linguistic behaviors. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","adolescence;

The main argument is that the emergence of the Arab satellite media in the region, such as al-Jazeera TV Channel and the Internet, has had a significant impact on the political and socio-cultural transformation in different Arab countries. It examines how the Arab media reported the fall of Hosni Mubarak's regime in Egypt early 2011. The study focuses on how the pan-Arab satellite news channel al-Jazeera handled the news from narrative and visual perspectives. We shall argue that al-Jazeera, among others, has played a crucial role in the process of transformation, both during the uprising itself and beyond it. © 2012 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","al-Jazeera; Egyptian uprising; Hosni Mubarak; pan-Arab satellite TV",,,,,,,,,,"Adams, W., Whose lives count?

Arab Labor was a breakthrough in the Israeli popular TV scape, where, as a rule, Arab-Israeli citizens are either depicted stereotypically, or as symbolically 'extinct'. Broadcast in primetime, the series exposed Jewish-Israeli viewers for the first time to AI petit bourgeoisies - a middle-class Arab-Israeli 'normative' family. The episode is a core example of the way in which satire is employed to promote the 'liberal bargain' between the Jewish democratic liberal state and its Arab-Israeli citizens, depicting a lifestyle vacillating between hybrid multilayered identity options, within the complex, often difficult reality of the Arab-Israeli citizens in Israel. Methodology combined both integrated CDA and focus groups, in order to reveal the modes in which deep cultural constructs are embodied in the episode, and to explore how these representation modes are deciphered by middle-class academic Jewish-Israeli and Arab-Israeli female viewers. As opposed to the prevailing extreme nationalism accompanied by multiculturalism, to a large degree as a consequence of neo-liberal economy, our analysis and findings reveal that Arab Labor suggests an alternative vision for Israeli society: the 'liberal bargain', which favours liberalism and cultural pluralism within a welfare nation state, in which disputes and conflicts are peacefully resolved. © 2012 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","Arab Labor; Arab-Israelis; liberal bargain; Sayed Kashua; TV satire",,,,,,,,,,"Abu-Rabia-Queder, S., (2008) Excluded and loved: Educated Bedouin women's life stories, , Jerusalem: Eshkolot & Magnes Publisher (Hebrew); Adoni, H., Cohen, A., Caspi, D., (2006) Media, minorities and hybrid identities: The Arab and Russian communities in Israel, , Cresskill, NJ: Hampton Press; Anderson, B., (1991) Imagined communities, , London: Verso, New Left Books; A'nem, H., (2005) Attitudes toward the status and rights of Palestinian woman in Israel, , Nazareth: The Association of Women Against Violence; Anson, J., Meir, A., Religiosity, nationalism and fertility in Israel (2007) Israel's destiny: Fertility and morality in a divided society, 12, pp. 29-51. , In: Schellekens J., Anson J., editors Israel Sociological Society, NJ: Transaction Publishers Rutgers; Arian, A., (2012) A portrait of Israeli Jews: Beliefs, observance, and values of Israeli Jews, 2009, , http://www.idi.org.il/sites/english/PublicationsCatalog/Pages/Book_7783/Main.aspx, Jerusalem: The Guttman Center Surveys (Hebrew/English) Retrieved January 1, 2012, from; Avraham, E., First, A., The good, the bad and the absent: Contradictory trends in the treatment of Arabs on Israeli TV (2004) Mediterranean Journal of Human Rights, 8 (2), pp. 55-78; Barthes, R., (1972) Mythologies, , London: Paladin; Barthes, R., Roland Barthes-Bernard Henry-Levi (1977) Discourses: Conversations in postmodern art and culture, pp. 425-441. , In:, In:, In:, In: Ferguson R., editorsOlander W., editorsTucker M., editorsFiss K., editors New York: The New Museum of Contemporary Art Cambridge, MA, London: The MIT Press; Barber, B., (1996) Jihad vs. McWorld: How globalism and tribalism are reshaping the world, , New York, NY: Ballantine Books; Bekerman, E., (2008) Gaydamak: A Russian popular legend.

Through scrutinizing four selected narratives, published by four pan-Arab journalists from three different transnational satellite channels (Abu Dhabi TV, Al Jazeera and Al Manar), I aim to show how their narratives help consolidate the professional status of pan-Arab journalists vis-à-vis local and western media. I argue that Arab journalists seek to establish their authority as historians through rewriting the history of certain battles, such as the battle of Fallujah, or through reflecting on their news-gathering efforts. Thus, their narratives also help consolidate their status as 'watchdog' and analysts while implicitly consolidating their cultural authority as reliable historians. © 2012 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","cultural authority; Iraq War; narrative; war correspondents; witnessing",,,,,,,,,,"Ahl Barra, H., (2004) Front-line chronicles from the wars: The complete story behind Abu Dhabi's coverage of 9/11, Afghanistan war and Baghdad fall, , Beirut: Arab Scientific Publishers [in Arabic]; Al Jazeera, (2006) The Al Jazeera Decade 1996-2006, , Doha: Al Jazeera; Al Jack, S., The status of Arab media in a BBC conference in Beirut (2004) Al Sharq Al Awsat, 9277, , http://www.aawsat.com/details.asp?section=24&article=229874&issueno=9277, Retrieved April 22, 2004 from; Ayish, M., American-style journalism and Arab world television: An exploratory study of news selection at six Arab world satellite television channels (2001) Transnational Broadcasting Studies, 6 (Spring). , Summer 2001; El Masry, I., (2007) The pavement of murdered, , Beirut: Arab Institute for Research & Publishing.

It shares the same inequalities and social challenges as the rest of the countries in the region. However, the revolutionary process in Algeria between 1954 and 1962 and the civil war that hit the country during the 1990s with the Berbers' regional claims have depoliticized the masses or generated a fear of change. This explains why mobilizations in Algeria have not been successful as in other countries. In addition, the role of the Algerian army is sui generis and has allowed the current stability around an old president. © 2012 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","Berbers; Islamic Salvation Front; Kabylia; National Liberation Army; Popular Liberation Front",,,,,,,,,,"135 cas de suicides à Sidi-Bel-Abbès (2011) Al Watan, p. 4. , Al Watan; (2005) Al Watan, pp. 5+5. , Al Watan: Le SNAPAP soutient Bouteflika; Belkaid, A., Attentes sociales et peur du chaos en Tunisie (2011) Le Monde Diplomatique, 58 (684), p. 16; 5.500 milliards dinars dans le fonds de régulation des recettes (2012) El Moudjahid, p. 2. , El Moudjahid; L'Algérie déroute l'Europe (2006) Expression, p. 3. , Expression; Genoux, F., L'Algérie en manque d'opposition (2011) Le Monde, p. 9; Gerges, F.A., The decline of revolutionary Islam in Algeria and Egypt (1999) Survival: Global Politics and Strategy, 41 (9), pp. 112-134; Haichour, B., Matrice généalogique et fondement de l'Etat moderne (1998) El Moudjahid, p. 5; Harbi, M., (1980) Le FLN, mirage et réalité.

More precisely, I examine how these young adults have experienced and judge French as a second official language (FSOL) learning in 'English-dominant' regions of Canada. Through a questionnaire and interviews, the participants reveal that they invest in FSOL with the goal of adding French to their multilingual repertoire that includes English primarily in hopes of future economic gain. Examining the data through the lens of investment, I posit that access to FSOL as an investment and conversion of the investment into economic gain is mitigated by unequal positions of power that highlight Canada's emphasis on official language bilingualism to the practical exclusion of multilingualism. I suggest that means to change unequal practices may lie in the bi-directionality of relations between education and society and propose that rather than having language education in Canada reflect the official discourse, that education be used as a means to influence the discourse and practice thereof to be more inclusive of all languages. © 2012 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","cultural identity; language learning; multiculturalism; multilingualism; second language learning",,,,,,,,,,"Bourdieu, P., (1977) Outline of a theory of practice, , New York, NY: Cambridge University Press; (1982), http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/charter/, Canadian Charter of Rights Freedoms, Retrieved December 13, 2011, from; (1985) Canadian Multiculturalism Act, , http://laws.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-18.7/page-1.html, Canada, Department of Justice Retrieved December 13, 2011, from; (1985) Official Languages Act, , http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/O-3.01/, Canada, Department of Justice, [R.S. 1985, c. 31 (4th Supp.)].

Drawing on Ducrot's theory of polyphony, it takes preliminary steps in formulating an alternative conception of the individual subject that incorporates a polyphonic articulation of the self. It then explores the role that dialogism has on our understanding of inter-religious encounters. Lastly, through reference to contemporary documents on inter-religious dialogue, it argues against the privileging of the secular nation state, and concludes that there is no possibility for intercultural dialogue without an inter-religious encounter: intercultural dialogue is a holy place to be. © 2012 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","dialogical identity; diatopical hermeneutics; inter-religious dialogue; intercultural dialogue; polyphonic",,,,,,,,,,"Austin, J.L., (1988) How to do things with words, , Oxford: Oxford University Press; Back, L., The fact of hybridity: Youth, ethnicity and racism (2002) A companion to racial and ethnic studies, pp. 439-454. , In: Goldberg D.T., Solomos J., editors Oxford: Blackwell; Bakhtin, M., Discourse in the novel (1981) The dialogic imagination, , In: Holquist M., editors Austin: University of Texas Press; Bhabha, H.K., Culture's in-between (1996) Questions of cultural identity, , In: Hall S., Du Gay P., editors London: Sage; Cornille, C., (2002) Many mansions?

Interestingly enough, this development has simultaneously been accompanied by the celebration of polyglossia. The illusion of frictionless linguistic cohesion in a multilingual world is not only constructed by the universal use of English as lingua franca; it is also largely constructed by the transformation of languages into easily and fast acquirable articles to be used by travellers.A huge ever-increasing language-learning industry flourishes around tourist fluxes: additionally to language sections included in guidebooks there is a profusion of pocket language guides, 'essential guides', 'mini dictionaries', 'phrase books', 'conversation guides' in all possible languages.The present paper aims at reflecting on the way languages are portrayed in such texts deliberately conceived for people on the move. It focuses, in particular, on Portuguese and the way it is framed in contemporary tourist guides. © 2011 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","mobility; Portuguese language; representation; tourist guidebooks",,,,,,,,,,"Appadurai, A., (1996) Modernity at large: Cultural dimensions of globalization, , Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press; Bauer, L., Trudgill, P., (1998) Language myths, , London: Penguin Books; Bauman, Z., (2000) Liquid modernity, , Cambridge: Polity Press; (2010) Berlitz Pocket Guide Portugal, , London: Berlitz Publishing/Apa; Clifford, J., (1997) Routes, travel and translation in the late twentieth century, , Cambridge, MA/London: Harvard University Press; Cordeiro, M.J., (2010) Olhares Alemães: Portugal na Literatura Turística.

What would happen to translation if the culture concept was not the starting point for theorizing? In order to answer this question I examine the contributions of Eagleton, Keesing, Cronin and, most particularly, of the anthropologist Tim Ingold and his important work The Perception of the Environment. From this I then proceed to examine pertinent extracts of the works of two Celtic authors; Brian Friel's Translations and Margaret Elphinstone's A Sparrow's Flight in order to develop a relationally grounded view of translation. This view privileges both the land and the work of languaging as key aspects of translation, inhabiting positions in the world, rather than constructing and mediating views of the world. I therefore come to see translation as a mode of perception, a sensory even empathic mode, a languaging response to phenomena, its primary relationship, not with culture and genealogy but as positionality - in and with the land and to develop towards a geopoetics of the taskscape of the translator. © 2011 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","anthropology; cultural translation; environment; intercultural narrative; linguistic diversity; translation",,,,,,,,,,"Bassnett, S., Lefevere, A., (1998) Constructing cultures: Essays on literary translation, , Clevedon: Multilingual Matters; Baudelaire, C., (1972) Les fleurs du mal, , Paris: Editions Gallimard; Benjamin, W., (1973) Illuminations, , London: Fontana; Breathnach, C., (1992) An fearann breac, , Dublin: Coiscéim; Brueggemann, W., (2003) An introduction to the Old Testament: The canon and Christian imagination, , Louisville, KY: Westminster John Knox Press; Clifford, J., (1997) Routes: Travel and translation in the late twentieth century, , Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press; Cronin, M., (2000) Across the lines: Travel, language and translation, , Cork: Cork University Press; Cronin, M., Thou shalt be one with the birds': Translation, connexity and the New Global Order (2002) Language and Intercultural Communication, 2 (2), pp. 86-95; Cronin, M., Babel's standing stones: Language, translation and the exosomatic (2002) Crossings, 2 (1), pp. 1-7; de Certeau, M., (1984) The practice of everyday life, , Los Angeles and London: University of California Press; Deleuze, G., Guattari, F., (1988) A thousand plateaux: Capitalism and schizoprenia, , London: Athlone; Eagleton, T., (2000) The idea of culture, , Oxford: Blackwell; Eagleton, T., (2003) After theory, , London: Penguin; Elphinstone, M., (1989) A sparrow's flight: A novel of a future, , Edinburgh: Polygon; Friel, B., (1981) Translations, , London: Faber and Faber; Gormley, A., An Interview with Anthony Gormley (2005), p. 17. , Third Way, March; Hopkins, G.M., Pied Beauty (1918) The poems of Gerald Manley Hopkins, , London: Humphrey Milford; Ingold, T., The art of translation in a continuous world (1993) Beyond boundaries: Understanding, translation and anthropological discourse, pp. 210-230. , In: Pálsson G., editors Oxford: Berg; Ingold, T., (2000) The perception of the environment: Essays in livelihood, dwelling and skill, , London & New York: Routledge; Ingold, T., (2011) Being alive: Essays on movement, knowledge and description, , London: Routledge; Keesing, R.M., Radical cultural difference: Anthropology's myth?

After a short review of the existing literature, this study attempts to establish a typology of Chinglish with corpus-based research. Additionally, the corpus serves for geographical and statistical analysis. This study finds that the majority of errors are over-literal translations with grammatical mistakes. Only a few signs feature irrelevant wording, Pinyin or typos. Very few signs feature Gibberish with completely unintelligible word fragments or a random set of characters. The problem does not lie with the sign producer, since most of the time the words appear to be correctly copied and stenciled onto a sign surface, the problem lies with the translator. The number of Propaganda Chinglish signs is very low, given the commercial nature of more than 90% of the corpus. Noticeably, more than 80% of the signs carrying non-commercial information or guidance or warnings do not feature the institution, official bureaus or authorities that issued the signs. Tourism is a major contributor of the corpus with about one fourth of the total number of signs. Further research is needed to elaborate on the decorative use of English in the commercial realm, where the existence of non-Chinese lettering is used to establish an appearance of cosmopolitanism or the status of an international brand.

Language and the literary education that characterised English education in India during colonial times play an important role in the construction of identity of such Indians. The love and idealisation of an 'imagined' England constructed from literary texts, and the encounter with reality upon travel to England, are depicted in many fictional and autobiographical accounts. Focusing on a sample of such texts from the 1950s to the 1970s, this paper looks at representations of the first-hand experience of England for those who identify themselves with Englishness on the strength of their intellectual and emotional connection with it through love for the language and literature. The study yields interesting insights that may have implications for current movements of people across the globalised world, with shared language and education as their 'intellectual' passport and a confident sense of identity and belonging with the West and its culture, based on 'familiarity' acquired through a shared language and images derived from ubiquitous media sources. © 2011 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","autobiography; identity; immigrants; language learning; narrative accounts; postcolonialism",,,,,,,,,,"Anant, V., (1959) The revolving man, , London: MacGibbon & Kee; Anant, V., The three faces of an Indian (1960) Alienation, pp. 79-92. , In: O'Keefe T., editors London: MacGibbon & Kee; Bennett, G., (1962) The concept of empire, Burke to Attlee, 1774-1947, , London: Adam and Charles Black; Bhabha, H.K., Of mimicry and man: The ambivalence of colonial discourse (1984) October, 28, pp. 125-133; Boehmer, E., (1995) Colonial and postcolonial literature: Migrant metaphors, , Oxford: Oxford University Press; Chatterjee, P., (1993) The nation and its fragments: Colonial and postcolonial histories, , Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press; Chaudhuri, N., (1959) A passage to England, , London: Macmillan; Chaudhuri, N., (1968) The autobiography of an unknown Indian, , Berkeley: University of California Press; Desai, A., [First published 1971] (2006) Bye bye blackbird, , New Delhi: Orient Paperback; Desani, G.V., (1948) All about Mr. Hatterr: A gesture, , London: Aldor; Esser, H., Migration, language and integration (2006) AKI Research Review, 4, pp. 1-117; Fishman, J.A., (1998) Foreign Policy, 113, pp. 26-40; Ghosh, S.K., (1961) My English journey, , Calcutta: Writers Workshop; Graddol, D., (2006) English next, , British Council; Guha, R., (1988) An Indian historiography of India: A nineteenth century agenda and its implications, , Calcutta: K.P.

Little is known, however, about how language students make sense of their changing linguistic identities as they encounter users of the language of instruction outside the classroom. This paper examines the stories those enrolled in university-level Spanish courses tell about their language learning histories and experiences.

The analysis of the data shows that only a short-term increase in Intercultural Communicative Competence was reported by the children immediately after the Village. The increase was neither statistically significant, nor evident nine months after the Village. However, the analysis of the children's selfreport shows that most of the children were positive about the experience. Establishing, expanding and maintaining friendship constituted the primary aim as well as outcome of their intercultural learning. These research findings are discussed in the broader contexts of the ideology of global citizenship and the global spaces created through intercultural exchanges. © 2011 Taylor & Francis.","CISV; Friendship; Intercultural communicative competence; Intercultural learning; Self-assessment; Self-report",,,,,,,,,,"Bachner, D.J., Zeutschel, U., Long-term effects of international educational youth exchange (2009) Intercultural Education, 20 (S1-S2), pp. S45-S58; Baraldi, C., Experiential learning, Intercultural Communicative Competence and Global Citizenship (2009) Keynote speech at ESRC Festival of Social Sciences Seminar on Learning by Doing: Intercultural communication and Global Citizenship from a young age, , (March 13)., Birkbeck, University of London; Barrett, M., Children's understanding of, and feelings about, countries and national groups (2005) Children's understanding of society, pp. 251-286. , In M.

This was a 3-year, seven-country European Commission funded study of young people, the Internet and civic participation. Specifically, it calls upon evidence from qualitative case studies of three contemporary civic websites in Britain, the UK Youth Parliament, European Youth Portal and MuslimYouth.Net, including textual analysis as well as interviews with key producers and young users of these and other civic sites. In light of current debates around the best means of engaging young people in civic activities on- and offline, the paper seeks to answer questions about the potential benefits and dangers of producers' pedagogic styles, ideological perspectives and normative choices in relation to young people's civic motivation and efficacy. Finally the paper looks at the match or disjuncture between the sites' missions for youth citizenship and the actual young people who respond to the sites' address and ethos and asks how more civic producers can move towards a situated, motivating and inclusive model of communication on- and offline. © 2011 Taylor & Francis.","Civic producers; Civic websites; Inclusion; Intercultural communication; Participation; Young people",,,,,,"European Commission, EC

I examine immigration and intercultural communication in a more complex and nuanced manner by researching the ways in which expatriates or 'high-end' immigrants relocate and interact with host cultures. I conducted 11 months of ethnographic fieldwork and 40 in-depth interviews in Costa Rica to explore this phenomenon. I employ critical discourse analysis to analyze the data in the theoretical framework of hybridity as the participants create interesting linguistic and cultural spaces in Costa Rica. In these moments of contingency and conflict we are forced to renegotiate the concept of immigration and construction of immigrant. This study illustrates both practical and theoretical intercultural implications as relatively affluent English-speaking migrants have begun to move outside their homelands. This movement of people creates a need for scholars to rethink definitions of immigrants as non-traditional immigrants relocate to new cultural and linguistic terrains. © 2011 Taylor & Francis.","Discourse; Ethnography; Immigration; Intercultural communication; Language contact; Power relations",,,,,,,,,,"Bakhtin, M.M., (1981) The Dialogic Imagination, , Austin: The University of Texas Press; Benson, M.C., The context and trajectory of lifestyle migration: The case of the British residents of southwest France (2010) European Societies, 12 (1), pp. 45-64; Bhabha, H.K., (1994) The Location of Culture, , New York: Routledge; Biesanz, M.H., Biesanz, R., Biesanz, K.B., (1999) The Ticos: Culture and Social Change In Costa Rica, , Boulder, CO: Lynne Rienner; Blommaert, J., (2005) Discourse, , New York: Cambridge University Press; Briggs, C., (1986) Learning How to Ask: A Sociolingustic Appraisal of the Role of the Interview In Social Science Research, , Cambridge: Cambridge University Press; Choi, J.M., Murphy, J.W., Nobody simply vanishes: The politics of disappearance (2000) Hybrid Spaces: Theory, Culture, Economy, pp. 63-71. , In J.

Specifically, the paper traces the logics of one transnational NGO, Save the Children, as it teaches communication practices and values related to children's rights in developing countries. The paper illustrates how the NGO promotes Global Citizenship values and communication practices, which are taken to be universally applicable. For example, the NGO promotes self-expression and participatory decision- making to its client populations, practices which are grounded in individualistic notions of relating. These ways of communicating are not only different from but also sometimes conflict with sociocultural and political ways of acting and relating in particular locales. The paper argues that Global Citizenship is a vision choreographed by donor countries with moral and ideological implications. It calls on scholars, political decision-makers, and NGOs to reflect on who defines the concept, drives its implementation, and understand the impact of imported interaction values on local populations. © 2010 Taylor & Francis.","Communicative practice; Global citizenship; Narrative; Transnational NGO; Values",,,,,,,,,,"Al-Sakkaf, N., (2009) Children Find a Voice For their Issues Through Animation, , http://sca.savethechildren.se/Middle_East_and_North_Africa/Resources/Archive-News/Children-find-a-voice-for-their-issues-through-animation-/, July 13, Yemen Times.

A number of important relationships were identified and are discussed from a socio-political and socio-educational perspective. © 2010 Taylor & Francis.","English language learning; Intercultural relations; Japanese national identification; Structural equation modelling",,,,,,,,,,"Anderson, B., (2006) Imagined Communities: Reflections On the Origin and Spread of Nationalism, , London: Verso; (1994) Japanese Education Since 1945: A Documentary Study, , Beauchamp, R., & Vardaman, J.M (Eds.), New York: East Gate Books; Blank, T., Schmidt, P., National identity in a united Germany: Nationalism or patriotism?

Focusing specifically on episodes beginning with intercultural questioning, we will analyse: (1) typical situations leading to these kinds of questions and; (2) recurrent discursive topics of the corpus. These two subjects will allow us to reflect on how plurilingual/intercultural on-line communication 're-socializes' individuals, creating new images/ representations about others and their (inter)cultural identities and by promoting a greater awareness of what it means to participate in intercultural discussions. © 2010 Taylor & Francis.","Chats; Intercultural communicative competence; Multilingual telecollaboration; Questioning",,,,,,,,,,"Allport, G., (1979) The Nature of Prejudice, , Reading, MA: Addison-Wesley; Andrade, A.I., Araújo e Sá, M.H., Lopéz Alonso, C., Melo, S., Séré, A., (2005) Galanet: Manual Do Utilizador [Users' Manual], , Aveiro: Universidade de Aveiro; Araújo e Sá, M.H., Melo, S., Beso em portugue&#x02C6;s diz-se beijo:*': La gestion des problémes de l'interaction dans des chats plurilingues romanophones' [Kiss in Portuguese is beijo:*': Interactional problems management in multilingual chats] (2003) Lidil, 28; Araújo e Sá, M.H., Melo, S., On-line plurilingual interaction in the development of language awareness (2007) Language Awareness, 16 (1), pp. 7-20; Belz, J., Intercultural questioning, discovery and tension in Internet-mediated language learning partnerships (2005) Language and Intercultural Communication, 5 (1), pp. 3-39; Belz, J., The development of intercultural communicative competence in telecollaborative partnerships (2007) Online Intercultural Exchange, pp. 127-166. , In R.

However, dominant neo-essentialist theories of culture give the impression that we are too different to easily cross-cultural boundaries. These theories support the development of academic disciplines and the need for professional certainty in intercultural training. There is an illusion of neutrality in established cultural descriptions such as collectivism and individualism. The criticism of this position is that such theories and descriptions may instead be ideologically constructed, and represent an idealised Self and a demonised non-Western Other. This denial of ideology results in a liberal-essentialist duality which also underpins multi- culturalism. A critical cosmopolitanist approach and a social action theory of society project a different picture of culture which resides in realities which respond to personal circumstances. A cultural realism not only acknowledges the influence of national structures but also allows for the agency of the individual. However, the Centre positioning of established theories of culture means that emergent realities residing on the always defined Periphery need to assert an existence that the always defining Centre needs to appreciate. © 2010 Taylor & Francis.","Culture; Ideology; Prejudice",,,,,,,,,,"Alavi, N., (2005) We are Iran, , London: Portobello Books; Bendix, R., (1966) Max Weber: An intellectual portrait, , London: Methuen; Berger, P., Luckmann, T., (1979) The social construction of reality, , Harmondsworth: Pelican; Bhabha, H., (1994) The location of culture, , London: Routledge; Bond, M.H., Žegarac, V., Spencer-Oatey, H., Culture as an explanatory variable: Problems and possibilities (2000) Culturally speaking: Managing rapport through talk across cultures, pp. 47-69. , In H.

The dominant discourse constructs Chinesespeaking students as members of a homogenised collective: passive recipients of knowledge who are reliant on a reproductive approach to learning. This article seeks to offer a corrective to such notions, which underestimate the complexity and dynamism of Chinese academic cultures. Using a critical ethnographic approach, it examines interdiscourse communication within the context of institutional performances. In 'international evenings' and 'debate contests' Chinese-speaking students are observed to engage in acts of 'crossing' and 'styling', involving the selective and playful appropriation of the discourses of the Other. These communicative events are thus seen as sites of discursive struggle and transculturation in which hybrid identities are negotiated and contradictory subjectivities are produced. © 2010 Taylor & Francis.","Crossing; Identities; Interculturality; Otherisation; Styling",,,,,,,,,,"Adamson, B., Modernising English language teacher education (1998) Higher education in post-Mao China, pp. 141-164. , In M.

Focusing on the use of address terms and 'talk about social, cultural, and linguistic practice,' the paper argues that IC is not only a dynamic process through which participants make aspects of their multiple and shifting identities relevant, but also a process of developing new social and cultural identities. In effect, it serves as a direct means of language socialization for the younger generation who are developing their sociocultural roles and learning about the social and cultural appropriateness of behavior in a diasporic context, where there are potentially substantial differences in social and cultural values between the wider local community and the diasporic community. Language socialization is regarded in this study as not simply about passing social and cultural values from one generation to another, but about bringing about changes in social and cultural values. Through language socialization, the younger generations of diasporic communities not only internalize the social, cultural and linguistic norms of their community, but also play an active role in constructing and creating their own social and cultural identities as well as bringing about changes to the existing community and family norms. © 2010 Taylor & Francis.","Address terms; Chinese diasporic community; Interculturality; Intergenerational talk; Language socialization",,,,,,,,,,"Alba, R., Nee, V., (2003) Remaking the American mainstream: Assimilation and contemporary immigration, , Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press; Angouri, J., If we know about culture it will be easier to work with one another': Developing skills for handling corporate meetings with multinational participation (2010) Language and Intercultural Communication, 10 (3), pp. 206-224; (1998) Identities in talk, , Antaki, C., & Widdicombe, S.

Within applied linguistics cultural categorisation is hard to avoid; the large number of cross-cultural studies of languages and language use bear witness to this. Categorisation itself is a necessary part of human activity; without it, communication of meaning would become impossible. This article considers what happens in practice when tandem learners talk about word meaning in semi-structured conversations. Examples of moments in the conversations where interlocutors use cultural and personal categorisation are considered, as are the purposes for which they do so. Analysis reveals the wide range of such categorisation, marking both similarity and difference, fixing positions and moving on. Categorisation therefore plays a far more complex role in practice than simply limiting possibilities; in some cases, it is used to open them up. © 2010 Taylor & Francis.","Categorisation; Stereotyping; Tandem; Word meaning",,,,,,,,,,"Blum-Kulka, S., House, J., Cross-cultural and situational variation in requesting behaviour (1989) Cross-cultural pragmatics: Requests and apologies, pp. 23-153. , In S.

Against this backdrop much emphasis has been placed on the need for training current and future employees in order to develop their work-related communication skills. In this context, the paper reports on an ongoing study into workplace discourse and its implications for pedagogic practice. I discuss here operationalisations of the concept of culture in pedagogic materials, and focus on the meeting event as presented through texts published in some widely used Business English textbooks in the UK. Special attention is paid to the underlying assumptions about culture and preferred norms for handling meetings which feature multinational participation - as presented by the textbooks but also in relevant academic literature. The discussion also draws on data from multinational companies in Europe. The analysis shows that textbooks often take a macro-level view of culture and treat it as an entity with distinct boundaries. This paper closes by making a case for sociolinguistic research findings to feed back into the language classroom to complement language for specific purposes textbooks for further developing learners' socio-pragmatic skills. © 2010 Taylor & Francis.","Intercultural communication; LSP; Meeting talk; Textbooks; Workplace discourse",,,,,,,,,,"Ailon-Souday, G., Kunda, G., The local selves of global workers: The social construction of national identity in the face of organizational globalization (2003) Organization Studies, 24, pp. 1073-1096; Angouri, J., (2007) Language in the workplace.

Data from three life narrative case studies - British adults who have studied French to a high level - illustrate how situated repertoires are circulated and reproduced.

It is shown that the metaphors used in these texts frequently do not so much represent congenial relations of hospitality between native and non-native speakers as unequal power relations, in which the non-native speaker feels 'imprisoned' or 'infantilised'. The paper also considers some of the other metaphors common to such texts, which may represent universal conceptualisations of language learning experiences. Dieser Artikel ist Teil eines größeren Forschungsprojekts, das die Darstellung von einem umdefinierten Begriff kantianischer 'Mündigkeit' in subjektiven Erzählungen über Sprachlernerfahrungen, die als Sprachlernererzählungen bezeichnet werden, untersucht. Es wird gezeigt, daß die Metaphern, die in diesen Texten verwendet werden, eher ungleiche Machtsverhältnisse, in denen sich der Nichtmuttersprachler 'gefangen' oder 'infantilisiert' fü hlt, als angenehme Beziehungen von Gastfreundschaft, darstellen. Der Artikel berücksichtigt auch andere Metaphern, die diese Texte gemeinsam haben, die möglicherweise universelle Konzeptualisierungen von Sprachlernerfahrungen darstellen. © 2010 Taylor & Francis.","Cross-cultural autobiography; Intercultural narrative; Language learner narrative; Language learning; Metaphor; Mündigkeit; Multilingualism",,,,,,,,,,"Alexakis, V., (2006) Paris-Athènes, , Paris: Stock; Alvarez, J., (1999) Something to Declare, , New York: Penguin; Bauby, J.-D., (2008) The Diving Bell and the Butterfly, , London: Harper Perennial; Dorfman, A., (1998) Heading South, Looking North: A Bilingual Journey, , London: Hodder and Stoughton; Dykman, E., The vagabond years (2000) Language Crossings: Negotiating the Self in a Multicultural World, pp. 30-34. , In K.

Drawing on a series of qualitative research interviews, the analysis highlights the implications of internationalization for individual lecturer's ability to act and interact in the classroom, changing the form of the lecturer's message as well as its content and frame of reference. A major theme emerging from the inquiry is language since most lecturers agree that the linguistic change from Danish into English, which is requested for most international programmes, affects the quality and quantity of classroom communication. A second theme is cultural diversity, which the lecturers characterise as an obstacle as well as a possible resource in the multicultural classroom. © 2010 Taylor & Francis.","Intercultural communication; Intercultural learning; Linguistic diversity; Multiculturalism",,,,,,,,,,"Allan, M., Frontier crossings: Cultural dissonance, intercultural learning and the multicultural personality (2003) Journal of Research in International Education, 2 (1), pp. 83-110; Bernard, R., (1995) Research Methods in Anthropology: Qualitative and Quantitative Approaches, , Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage; Bernstein, B., (1971) Class, Codes and Control, 1. , London: Routledge and Kegan Paul; Bernstein, B., (2000) Pedagogy, Symbolic Control and Identity: Theory, Research, Critique, , Lanham, MD: Rowman & Littlefield; Du, X., Hansen, S., Confronting cultural differences - learning engineering as foreigners in a Danish context: A case study of Chinese students (2004) Vest, 17 (1), pp. 23-46; Gudykunst, W., Kim, Y.Y., (2003) Communicating with Strangers, , Boston: McGraw-Hill; Healey, N., Is higher education in really 'internationalising'?

The particular case studied is that of the Department for International Development's 20-year language teacher education programme in China (1979-2001). By comparing Chinese tertiary ELT teachers' and British teacher educators' views on the practices of English language teaching and learning in the Chinese context, the article discusses the extent to which Chinese teachers' and British teacher educators' knowledge and beliefs about ELT may vary depending upon their background and the differing cultural contexts and traditions in which they find themselves. Evidence is provided of significant perception gaps between the views of expatriate British ELT specialists and local Chinese teachers, and between the British ELT specialists themselves. The article concludes by discussing the ways in which the research findings may contribute to efforts to improve the effectiveness of teaching English as an international language in the contemporary times of change. © 2010 Taylor & Francis.","Chinese elt; Cross-cultural training; Intercultural communication; Teacher professional development",,,,,,"Changjiang Scholar Program of Chinese Ministry of Education

The DFID (previously Overseas Development Agency) programmes of assistance to China in ELT consisted of 27 institutional strengthening projects, jointly administrated by the British Council and the Chinese Ministry of Education. The ELT development projects shared a major characteristic of most aid-funded development projects (Leach, 1994, p. 219), that is, provision of ‘on-the-job counterpart training’ through input from expatriate specialists. Typically, in order to achieve sustainability, a subgroup of Chinese counterparts was selected, on merit, to receive Master’s level training at a British university and, on return, to take over the role of the British specialists. The DFID ELT teacher education programmes ended in July 2001, when the last project was completed in Gansu province.",,,"Alexander, R.J., Border crossing: Towards a comparative pedagogy (2001) Comparative Education, 37 (4), pp. 507-523. , Bailey, R.W., & Gö; (1982) English as a World Language, , Bailey, R.W., & Görlach, M.

This development construes Europe as a plurilingual and intercultural space in which the linguistic and cultural identity of each community finds its place. However, the construction of Europe also faces the challenges of assuring communication among people of different languages, promoting participation in an expanded community, and discovering other cultures in a perspective of mutual knowledge. The strategies of intercomprehension can serve the purposes of discovering plurilingualism and promoting comprehension skills among speakers of different languages, specifically among speakers of languages belonging to the same family. The proposals that are presented and discussed in this article originate from the Euromania project, a Socrates/Lingua project directed at the development of the intercomprehension skills of pupils within the group of Romance languages. The project's learning materials aim, on the one hand, at developing pupils' intercomprehension strategies in association with the learning of various school subjects; in this way, the mobilization of intercomprehension skills acquires an immediate purpose by serving the process of learning those subjects. On the other hand, the operations performed by pupils in order to reconstruct meaning convert their strategies into learning tools. © 2009 Taylor & Francis.","Intercomprehension; Linguistic diversity; Multilingualism; Multimodality; Semiotics; Teacher education",,,,,,,,,,"Alves, S.S., ""EU&I - European awareness and intercomprehension"": Um Desafio Europeu (2007) Millenium, 33, p. 63; Alves, S.S., Mendes, L., Awareness and practice of plurilingualism and intercomprehension in Europe (2006) Language and Intercultural Communication, 6 (3-4), pp. 211-218; Bonnet, C., Tamine-Gardes, J., (1984) Quand l'enfant parle du Langage [When the Child Speaks About Language], , Bruxelles: Pierre Mardaga; Brédart, S., Rondal, J.-A., (1982) L'Analyse du Langage chez l'Enfant: Les Activités Métalinguistiques [The Child's Analysis of Language: Metalinguistic Activities], , Bruxelles: Pierre Mardaga; Capucho, F., (2002) The Role of Intercomprehension In the Construction of European Citizenship, , Viseu, Portugal: U.

Firstly, I discuss Nietzsche's positions on 'self' and 'subject,' arguing for the idea that 'there is no self.' Hence, I try to show that 'identity' is the outcome of a (co-)construction originating in the circumstance that each individual needs to meet external requests for (self-)identification, and therefore it is unable to take into account the process of individual 'becoming.' My conclusion is that such position might be relevant also in the field of intercultural communication, in that it leaves no room for essentialist understandings of 'identity'.","Identification; Identity; Intercultural communication; Nietzsche; Philosophy of the social sciences; Self",,,,,,,,,,"Adams, G., Markus, H.R., Culture as patterns: An alternative approach to the problem of reification (2001) Culture & Psychology, 7 (3), pp. 283-296; (1994) Situated Meaning.

In particular, the German adolescents from the Augsburg region (Bavaria) display a strong regional linguistic identity in combination with a tendency to the use of global English. In the Italian texts Spanish is adopted in various creative ways. Furthermore, the article raises the issue of the sociological implications of this specific use of multiple codes.","Computer-mediated communication; Discursive identity construction; German-Italian contrastive research; Internet guest-books; Multi-voicedness; Youth language",,,,,,,,,,"Antaki, Ch., Widdicombe, S., Identity as an achievement and as a tool (1998) Identities in Talk, pp. 1-14. , Sage, London; (2000) Chat-Kommunikation.

In the presentation of an identity under the name of multiculturalism, deeper questions emerge as to the identification of language through its imagination and production.

Issues relating to the multifaceted roles of English around the world have been highlighted and purist positions about English challenged. In particular (a) the assumption that British English is the only valid standard of English; and (b) the notion that the 'native speaker' is the only model that all learners should aspire to have been put to question. Based on the premise that these positions are incompatible with the complex reality of English worldwide, the necessity of a paradigm shift in English language teaching (ELT) has been advocated, whereby such purist tenets would have to change. However, the impact of academic debate on language teaching practice has been marginal. I argue that this state of affairs is attributable not only to the predilection for a monochrome form of English in the ELT industry and pedagogical practice, but also to shortcomings within academic discourse. The continued search for alternative models for ELT may be misleading, while a more effective response to the Anglo-American domination of ELT may in ensuring that classroom practice reflects more faithfully the process of acculturation of English that is taking place around the world. © 2009 Taylor & Francis.","Acculturation; Localisation; Paradigm shift; Relocation; World Englishes",,,,,,,,,,"Achebe, C., The African writer and the English language (1975) Morning Yet On Creation Day, pp. 55-62. , In C.

The findings demonstrate that these students' appropriation of EIL for their own advantage reflects a healthy and sensible sense of sharing the ownership of English. The findings also highlight the relationships between these students' sense of self and their positioning with respect to the English language. Many stereotypes about international students constructed around the English language and their being Asian have been challenged by the sophisticated and dynamic manner of the participants' appropriation of English. The article argues that together with encouraging and valuing users' appropriation of English, it is important to acknowledge and promote ways that individuals take ownership of English. Their voices must be heard, not assumed. Users of EIL need to be seen as individuals and in relation to who they are, who they want to be and who they could become and in multiple domains in which their identities are produced and reproduced. © 2009 Taylor & Francis.","Appropriation; Asia/Asian; English as an international language (EIL); Identity formation; International students; Ownership of English; Thailand",,,,,,,,,,"Ballard, B., Clanchy, J., Assessment by misconception: Cultural influences and intellectual traditions (1991) Assessing Second Language Writing In Academic Contexts, pp. 19-34. , In L.

These claims are submitted to critical scrutiny, and it is suggested that they may well be both statistically and theoretically flawed. More importantly, the dilemmas which the global spread of English poses for teachers in institutional settings are examined. It is suggested that, rather than promoting ELF as an emerging/emergent new variety, it may be more helpful to focus on the interactive process of English used globally, and the raising of awareness of this among learners, while continuing to teach them something approaching a standard variety. © 2009 Taylor & Francis.","Critical; English; Global; Lingua franca; Teaching",,,,,,,,,,"Anderson, A., Lynch, T., (1988) Listening, , Oxford: Oxford University Press; Crystal, D., (2003) English As a Global Language, , (2nd ed.).

Secondly, the way in which shifts of ownership and authority to non-native speakers and their varieties of English in combination more recently with global cultural flows, have created the need for reconceiving English as a pluralised global language, informed by local norms, functions and practices, reflecting a fluid and multiple cultural base. Lastly, it explores the way in which an ecological approach to English language teaching, which is oriented to 'globalisation from below' (Appadurai, 2000; Canagarajah, 2005), and which opens up a dialogical relationship between the global and the local, might help speakers in ex-colonial settings to reclaim their local identity and voice and thus realise the potential of globalisation to construct more inclusive, democratic relationships. © 2009 Taylor & Francis.","Culture; English as an international language (EIL); Globalisation; Hybridity; Local forms of knowledge and practice",,,,,,,,,,"Alptekin, C., Towards intercultural communicative competence in ELT (2002) Elt Journal, 56 (1), pp. 57-64; Appadurai, A., Grassroots globalization and the research imagination (2000) Public Culture, 12, pp. 1-20; Bhabha, H.K., (1994) The Location of Culture, , New York: Routledge; Bhatia, T.K., Ritchie, W.C., Bilingualism in the global media and advertising (2004) The Handbook of Bilingualism, pp. 513-545. , T.K.

Cultural issues are implicated in this change. Critical cosmopolitan approaches in the social sciences are critiquing the primacy of national cultures which they consider a Western imposition on the emergent identities of the Periphery. Within this climate traditional native-non-native speaker categories become a Centre professional imposition which imagines a 'non-native speaker' Other to be culturally deficient. The English as a lingua franca movement, while attempting to undo the supremacy of native speaker models of English, has therefore become implicated in a cultural struggle in which Centre definitions of language are accused of denying the voice of the Periphery. Proposed solutions suggest that the Centre must withdraw from defining the nature of culture and language, to allow Periphery educators and students to claim English and English language education in their own terms. Definitions of culture, such as collectivism and individualism, and of speakerhood and language standards, must be acknowledged as ideological acts within an unequal world. © 2009 Taylor & Francis.","Culture; English; International; Non-native speakers",,,,,,,,,,"Aboshiha, P., (2008) Identity and Dilemma: The 'native Speaker' English Language Teacher in a Globalising World, , Unpublished doctorol dissertation, English and Language Studies Department, Canterbury Christ Church University; Asante, M.K., The ideological significance of Afrocentricity in intercultural communication (2008) The Global Intercultural Communication Reader, pp. 47-55. , In M.K.

Relying on a framework of analysis that was initially developed for reconceptualisng culture (Nair-Venugopal, 2003a) in intercultural communication, these interculturalities in the Malaysian context are taken to refer to the ways in which identity constructions of personhood and nationhood are produced within local contexts of interaction, quite apart from demographic categorisation, organisational membership, social roles and other more traditional dimensions of identity construction. These interculturalities may be taken to be trajectories of both personhood as social identity, and of nationhood as national identities, in the intercultural encounters among members of heterogeneous groups in Malaysia. Viewed as multimodal identity constructions, they represent avenues for cross and intercultural adaptation in a plural yet seemingly multicultural country such as Malaysia that contribute to the evolving discourse on Bangsa Malaysia or national identity. © 2009 Taylor & Francis.","Articulations; Discourse; Identity production; Intercultural communication; Interculturalities; Multimodal language use",,,,,,,,,,"Asma, A., (1996) Going Glocal: Cultural Dimensions In Malaysian Management, , Kuala Lumpur: Malaysian Institute of Management; Asmah, H.O., (1991) Linguistic Scenery of Malaysia, , Kuala Lumpur: DBP; Auer, P., Kern, F., Three ways of analysing communication between East and West Germans as intercultural communication (2001) Culture In Communication: Analyses of Intercultural Situations, pp. 890-116. , A, Di Luzio, S.

The literature encourages dialogic transformative mediation, empowering participants' voices and changing cultural presuppositions in social systems. It may be doubtful, however, whether mediation can actually be effective in changing the status quo of social systems. My research analyses video-taped interpreter-mediated interactions, focussing on the mediators' translation activity, and on its relationship with the cultural presuppositions in the medical system. While occasionally a dialogic transformative mediation is achieved, mediation mainly supports a doctor-centred communication, preventing the empowerment of linguistic and cultural minorities. Il saggio analizza le forme di mediazione delle interazioni interlinguistiche in servizi sociosanitari italiani in contesti migratori. In letteratura, si incoraggia una mediazione dialogica trasformativa che dia voce ai partecipanti e modifichi i presupposti culturali dei sistemi sociali, ma si dubita anche che la mediazione sia efficace nel cambiare i sistemi sociali. Il saggio analizza alcune interazioni interlinguistiche audioregistrate, mettendo a fuoco la traduzione nel suo rapporto con i presupposti culturali del sistema della medicina. Sebbene possa anche realizzarsi in forma dialogica trasformativa, la mediazione promuove prevalentemente una comunicazione centrata sul medico, ostacolando la promozione delle minoranze linguistiche e culturali. © 2009 Taylor & Francis.","Context; Interaction; Intercultural communication; Interpreting; Migration; Voice",,,,,,,,,,"Angelelli, C.V., (2004) Medical Interpreting and Cross-cultural Communication, , Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press; Ayoko, O.B., Hartel, C.E., Callan, V.J., Resolving the puzzle of productive and destructive conflict in culturally heterogeneous workgroups: A communication accom- modation theory approach (2002) International Journal of Conflict Management, 13 (2), p. 195; Baker, M., Contextualization in translator- and interpreter-mediated events (2006) Journal of Pragmatics, 38 (321), p. 337; Baraldi, C., Gavioli, L., Dialogue interpreting as intercultural mediation.

The students' level of comfort with CMC, coupled with CMC's promises of enabling supplemental class discussion as well as reaching students at a distance, has encouraged more educators to incorporate CMC as part of their instruction. Also, classrooms in US higher education are becoming more diverse with students coming from many different cultural and linguistic backgrounds. In this context, this qualitative study describes experiences of international students in a large US Midwestern university as they participate in class discussion through CMC as a part of their course requirements. Seven Korean female students participated in the study, talking about their experiences of communication in cyberspace (CMC) in English through several in-depth interviews per participant. Analyses of interview data reveal the complex processes that they go through as they try to convey their ideas into English in cyberspace across the borders of language and culture. © 2008 Taylor & Francis.","Computer-mediated communication; Cultural minority; Intercultural communication; Korean female students; Non-native speakers of English; Qualitative research",,,,,,,,,,"Abrams, Z.I., The effect of synchronous and asynchronous CMC on oral performance in German (2003) The Modern Language Journal, 287 (2), pp. 157-167; Barbatsis, G., Fegan, M. and Hansen, K.

It has also been influenced by a broader educational shift away from an emphasis on print literacy and towards multiliteracies. At the same time, we have witnessed the rise of interrelated sociocultural and critical discourses which have made their presence felt, somewhat belatedly, in the areas of Teaching English to Speakers of Other Languages (TESOL) and Modern Foreign Languages (MFL). Film is an ideal medium through which to exploit the tools offered by sociocultural and critical discourses for the exploration of visual literacy and intercultural perspectives. Such exploration, it is suggested, should take place with full awareness of the transformational power of language learning which can, on the one hand, stimulate students' exploration of their own identities and, on the other, help prepare them for global citizenship. The model of intercultural literacies proposed here seeks to tie together these strands of possibility and serve as a practical guide for the pedagogical use of films in language courses. It is, more broadly, applicable to the use of any nontraditional literacies in developing students' intercultural competence. © 2008 Taylor & Francis.","Citizenship; Film; Intercultural competence; Literacy; Multiliteracies; Transformation",,,,,,,,,,"Auerbach, E.

Students from minority ethnic groups (as opposed to 'new immigrant' or international students) straddle more than one cultural and language setting. This paper reports a Scottish study which suggests that, as university students, both dominant and minority ethnic groups encounter similar challenges in the acquisition of academic literacies. However, it appears that for some resident bilingual minority ethnic group students the development of these literacies is closely related to their English language learning experience and, consequently, this may be a factor in the adoption of surface rather than deep approaches to learning at university level. Although the students in this study identified their own strengths in oral expression of their knowledge and understanding, they lamented their weaknesses in reading comprehension as well as in writing in academic genres. The research underpinning this study indicates that several factors could account for these weaknesses including limited specialist language teaching for resident bilingual pupils and lack of training of mainstream teachers in the primary sector in the language development needs of these pupils. Later in the educational journey through school and into university, a similar failure to identify the need to help resident bilingual learners to advance from their personal 'language plateaux' as a step in the development of their cognitive academic language proficiency inhibits potential growth. The paper suggests that a holistic approach to the acquisition of academic literacies across the school and university for students of all ethnicities would enhance opportunities for all who aspire to study in higher education. © 2008 Taylor & Francis.","Academic literacies; Academic self; Bilingualism; English as an additional language; Minority ethnic group",,,,,,,,,,"Allan, J. and Bruton, A.

The omission continues despite the fact that literacy practices in Africa have often served as a means of intercultural communication, especially among highly educated Africans. Proposals for the adoption of indigenous language literacy are not likely to succeed unless a policy is developed that deals with the problematic of intercultural communication. For maximum effectiveness, indigenous language literacy practices in Africa will have to involve a balance between vernacular, transcultural and intercultural literacy. This paper offers definitions for both intercultural literacy and transcultural literacy. It agues that exclusive vernacular literacy coupled with translation between vernacular languages will encourage language shift towards more powerful languages. By contrast, a practice of intercultural literacy will blunt the drift towards monoculturalism, while transcultural literacy will enhance recovery of local agency over African textual production. © 2008 Taylor & Francis.","Intercultural literacy; Monoculturalism; Transcultural literacy; Vernacular literacy",,,,,,,,,,"Adegbija, E., (1994) Language attitudes in Sub-Saharan Africa, , Clevedon, UK: Multilingual Matters; Adejunmobi, M., African language writing and writers: A case study of Jean-Joseph Rabearivelo and Ny Avana in Madagascar (1994) African Languages and Cultures, 7 (1), pp. 1-18; Adejunmobi, M., (2004) Vernacular palaver: Imaginations of the local and non-native languages in West Africa, , Clevedon, UK: Multilingual Matters; Anderson, B., (1991) Imagined communities, reflections on the origin and the spread of nationalism, , Revised edn, London: Verso; Anyidoho, K., Language and development strategy in Pan-African experience (1992) Research in African Literatures, 23 (1), pp. 45-63; Bamgbose, A., (1976) Mother tongue education: The West African experience, , London: Hodder and Stoughton; Bamgbose, A., (2000) Language and exclusion: The consequence of language policies in Africa, , Munster, Germany: Lit; Batibo, H., (2005) Language decline and death in Africa: Causes, consequences and challenges, , Clevedon, UK: Multilingual Matters; Bersselaar, van den, D., Creating 'Union Ibo': Missionaries and the Igbo language (1997) Africa, 67 (2), pp. 273-295; Boone, C., Africa's new territorial politics.

The global reach of SL and the opportunities it provides for cross-cultural exchange using multiple modes of communication in real and virtual worlds make it an ideal venue to examine cross-cultural engagement. Drawing on Cultural Historical Activity Theory and Heyward's model of intercultural literacy, this article analyses findings from an exploratory study examining the construction of cultural identity and development of intercultural literacy among 29 SL participants. The authors argue that SL Residents participate in an Activity System, engaging in myriad activities (e.g. language classes) which provide structured environments that generate both intended and unintended outcomes. The findings reveal that in many ways participation in SL enhanced participants' intercultural literacy for example, by fostering use of multiple languages, cross-cultural encounters and friendships, greater awareness of insider cultural perspectives, and openness towards new viewpoints. Additionally, respondents used their avatar's appearance to construct shifting cultural identities. Although the cross-cultural exchanges in SL do not guarantee intercultural literacy, they provide participants with opportunities to move in that direction. © 2008 Taylor & Francis.","Activity system; Computer-mediated communication; Cultural identity; Intercultural literacy; Internet-mediated communication; Virtual world",,,,,,,,,,"Bennett, J. and Beith, M.

We focus on language attitudes in so far as they promote integration in the host society at the same time that they play a major role in the acquisition of the new language. Globally, the results obtained show positive attitudes to Catalan and Spanish. This however, has to be further clarified taking into consideration the fact that, geographical origin clearly determines the attitudes showed by students.

A questionnaire and interview study that includes both Chinese students and their British teachers attempts to ascertain key issues with a view to helping sojourning students adapt to their environment, and to guiding teachers in offering them a more appropriate learning experience. The need for mutuality of understanding and action is stressed. Evidence from both interviews and the questionnaire survey suggests that, personal, pedagogical and psychological factors are equally important in influencing the intercultural adaptation process and outcomes. Early results show that despite various intercultural challenges and struggles, most students have managed to survive the demands of the learning and living environment, and to adapt and develop.","Chinese learners; Culture shock; Intercultural adaptation; Learning shock",,,,,,,,,,"Adler, P., The transitional experience: An alternative view of culture shock (1975) Journal of Humanistic Psychology, 15 (4), pp. 13-23; Agar, M., (1996) Language Shock: Understanding the Culture of Conversation, , Harper Paperbacks, New York; Anderson, L.E., A new look at an old construct: Cross-cultural adaptation (1994) International Journal of Intercultural Relationships, 18 (3), pp. 293-328; Berger, P.L., Luckmann, T., (1966) The Social Construction of Reality, , Penguin, London; Blair, T., (1999) Attracting More International Students; Bochner, S., Friendship patterns of overseas students: A functional model (1977) International Journal of Psychology, 12 (4), pp. 277-294; Byram, M., (1997) Teaching and Assessing Intercultural Competence, , Multilingual Matters, Clevedon; Byram, M., On being 'bicultural' and 'intercultural (2003) Intercultural Experience and Education, , Multilingual Matters, Clevedon; Byrnes, F.C., (1965) Americans in Technical Assistance: A Study of Attitudes and Responses to Their Role Abroad, , Praeger, New York; Byrnes, D.A., Role shock: An occupational hazard of American technical assistants abroad (1966) Annals, 368, pp. 95-108; Coleman, J.A., Study abroad (2004) Routledge Encyclopaedia of Language Teaching and Learning, pp. 582-584. , Routledge, London; Cummings, W., Asian values, education and development (1996) Compare, 26 (3), pp. 287-304; Cushner, K., Karim, A., Study abroad at the university level (2004) Handbook of Intercultural Training, pp. 289-308. , Sage, Thousand Oaks, CA; de Wit, H., (2002) Internationalization of Higher Education in the United States of America and Europe, , Greenwood, Westport, Conneticut; Forsman, L., The basis for being able to respect the other (2005) IATEFL Issues, pp. 4-5; Furnham, A., Bochner, S., (1986) Culture Shock, , Methuen, London; Furnham, A., Foreign students education and culture shock (2004) The Psychologist, 17 (1), pp. 16-19; Gu, Q., 'Enjoy loneliness'-understanding Chinese learners' voices (2005) Humanising Language Teaching, 7 (6); Gu, Q., Schweisfurth, M., Who adapts?

It investigates the influence of Chinese rhetoric on expository writing in English by three groups: the majority Chinese Han group, and two ethnic minorities, Tibetan and Mongolian. Relying on a contrastive text analysis of 30 hortatory exposition texts (10 for each group), the study critically examines the generic and rhetorical structures of the three groups' writing. The written outputs of the three groups are discussed with reference to Chinese EFL writing as a whole, and differences and similarities are identified and discussed. It is found that while the Tibetan, the Mongolian and the Han samples are similar in some general respects, they nevertheless differ from one another in a subtle manner, for example, in generic structure and the use of Qi-cheng-zhuan-he structure sequences within/between discourse units. These findings might result from mainstream Chinese culture's overriding influence on the rhetoric of the two subcultures. The study concludes by suggesting that future intracultural contrastive studies be carried out with consideration of students' first language (L1) transfer, English proficiency and learning experiences, and other developmental factors. © 2008 J.

Therefore, the essentialist view of culture and identity does not explain the process of integration of minorities in a context of acculturation, and leads to policies of ghettoisation. This text focuses on what we describe as cultural transfusion. By means of this process, we analyse two tendencies in personal identity: the first tendency, among professionals, integrates the culture of origin into the emerging cultural identity; the second denies the culture of origin and idealises the target culture as its aim in life. The most representative minorities in Portugal originate from the former colonies, Angola, Cabo Verde, Mozambique, East Timor, Macaw, Brazil and St. Tomé, and the immigrants from Eastern Europe that came to Portugal in the 1980s. We also describe the cultural and ethnic diversity of Portuguese society and show how nationalist ideology, imperialist ideals and the 'Luso-tropical' theory of Gilberto Freyre shaped the 'soft-racism' of the Portuguese. Furthermore, we give account of the recent trends of migration from Eastern Europe to Portugal, and try to explain Portuguese policy towards immigration after joining the European Union. © 2008 R.

For young people, one of the most popular ways of immersing themselves in the host environment is to become an au pair: move in with a family and look after their children to get first-hand experience of the culture and become a proficient user of their language. The present study explores 10 Hungarian undergraduates' socio-cultural and linguistic experiences and their perceptions of their au pair experiences in the UK as au pairs. Data were collected by a structured interview and a self-assessment language proficiency scale. Participants reported that after their experience, they overwhelmingly felt that they had achieved their goals: (1) they improved their proficiency, especially their oral production skills by becoming 'more fluent' in English; (2) they became independent and this experience helped them 'grow up'. It has also emerged from their narratives that despite living with native speakers and having positive attitudes towards them and their culture, they found it difficult to establish closer contact with them. © 2008 Taylor & Francis.","Au pair; Hungarian EFL Learners; Residence abroad",,,,,,,,,,"Allen, H.W., Herron, C., A mixed-methodology investigation of the linguistic and affective outcomes of summer study abroad (2003) Foreign Language Annals, 36 (6), pp. 370-385; Association of Language Testers in Europe (ALTE) The Can-Do Statements.

Hence it is important to study language and persuasion and solicit professional members' views about how effective communication is situated in different cultural contexts. This paper aims to report findings on differences in expectations for good writing between New Zealand and Chinese business cultures. A reflective model based on genre knowledge and Pan, Scollon and Scollon's (2002) reflective intercultural training method is developed as a major approach for soliciting managers' views. Specifically New Zealand and Chinese managers' views on their own culture as well as on their counterparts' were compared. It has been found that persuasive orientations underpin the criteria for good writing in each of the target cultures. However, what is insightful for both groups is that pathos or qing and logos or li should be seen as a continuum that can be adjusted appropriately when communicating with their counterparts. © 2008 Y.

He is also Visiting Professor of Sociology at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, USA. His research interests are in Political Sociology, Sociology of Law and in questions of epistemology. His research has embraced the struggles of colonial and postcolonial contexts in Brazil, Colombia, India, South Africa and Mozambique amongst others and he is a leading exponent of theories of Portuguese identity. In recent years his intellectual attention and political engagement has turned to the World Social Forum as a site of what he calls ‘counter hegemonic globalisation’ and resistance (see www.forumsocialmundial.org.br). His work draws upon rich linguistic and intercultural contexts, refusing to seek out simple technicist or positivist solutions to the vast array of complexities inherent in the ‘localised globalisms and globalised localisms’–the terms he uses to describe different relationships and positions within ‘neoliberal hegemonic globalisation’. In the relatively new field of interdisciplinary research, the aspects of power, resistance, complexity and hegemony take time to theorise. The work of Professor Santos offers a rich vein of theoretical reflection and translation for language(s) and intercultural communication.

After demonstrating the possibility of such narrative, a metaphorical model is proposed as a useful means of approaching the transcultural narrative. It is shown how an intellectual process of analogy and an affective process of empathy enable the transcultural narrative's initial alterity to be assimilated to form part of the reader's culturally specific conceptual system. This assimilation does not mean that the transcultural narrative ceases to be transcultural because, as is the case with all narratives, total comprehension and therefore total assimilation is impossible. © 2007 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Affect; Cognition; Metaphor; Transcultural narrative; Wit; Wonder",,,,,,,,,,"Appiah, K.A., (2005) The Ethics of Identity, , Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press; Aristotle, (1926) Art of Rhetoric, , Freese J.H., (ed), Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press; Bhabha, H.K., (1994) The Location of Culture, , London and New York: Routledge; Boitani, P., (2001) La sombra de Ulises.

To uncover the semantic representation of environmental activism on these sites, the authors sought to identify discursive homogeneity and divergence and to bring to light embedded cultural assumptions. The sites were examined between January and July 2003 to the fifth level. Multiple readings considered figures of style, lexical choices and lexical style, visual aspects, and topic and themes. The conclusion discusses the adeptness of localising and regionalising Greenpeace discourses but also points to a visible fragmentisation of environmental discourses as well as inherent inabilities to transcend highly localised understandings of the role of humans in nature. Most significantly, the study illustrates the discursive weight of implicit social and natural hierarchies. © 2007 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Culture; Discourse; Environment; Greenpeace",,,,,,,,,,"Bell, A., Garrett, P., (1998) Approaches to Media Discourse, , Malden, MA: Blackwell; Borgman, A., The nature of reality and the reality of nature (1995) Reinventing Nature?

English language learning has therefore been portrayed either as a fundamental tool that unquestionably brings professional success or one that oppresses us under capitalism, neoliberalism and the global market. Without questioning the veracity of both descriptions, indeed precisely for this reason, this paper argues for a critical pedagogy of English as a Global Language. The use of English as a common language, but not as a lingua franca, can provide us with opportunities for acting as responsible cosmopolitan citizens, without implying the loss of our cultural and ideological roots or the transformation of the English language into a neutral, disengaged or unaffiliated medium. This paper attempts to theorise this hypothesis based upon the ideas of authors such as Santos on globalisation and the World Social Forum, as well as the statements of EFL teachers on curriculum development. © 2007 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Citizenship; Cosmopolitanism; Curriculum; English; Globalisation",,,,,,,,,,"Adejunmobi, M., (2004) Vernacular Palaver: Imaginations of the Local and Non-native Languages in West Africa, , Clevedon: Multilingual Matters; Alpektin, C., Towards intercultural communicative competence in ELT (2002) ELT Journal, 56 (1), pp. 57-64; Bakhtin, M.M., (1929) Le Marxisme et la philosophie du langage ‘Markszism i filosofija jazyka, , Yaguello M., (ed), Paris: Les É ditions de Minuit; Bauman, Z., (1998) Globalization: The Human Consequences, , Cambridge: Polity Press; Beck, U., The cosmopolitan society and its enemies (2002) Theory, Culture & Society, 19 (1-2), pp. 17-44; Byram, M., On being bicultural and intercultural (2003) Intercultural Experience and Education, , Alred G., Byram M., Fleming M., (eds), Clevedon: Multilingual Matters; Byram, M., Guilherme, M., Human rights, cultures and language teaching (2000) Citizenship and Democracy in Schools: Diversity, Identity, Equality, , Osler A., (ed), Stoke on Trent, Sterling: Trendham Books Ltd; Canagarajah, A.S., (1999) Resisting Linguistic Imperialism in English Teaching, , Oxford: Oxford University Press; Canagarajah, A.S., Accommodating tensions in language-in-education policies: An afterword (2005) Decolonisation and Globalisation: Language-in-education Policy and Practice, pp. 194-201. , Lin A.M.Y., Martin P., (eds), Clevedon: Multilingual Matters; Corbett, J., (2003) An Intercultural Approach to English Language Teaching, , Clevedon: Multilingual Matters; Crawford, L.M., McLaren, P., A critical perspective on culture in the second language classroom (1998) Culture as the Core: Interdisciplinary Perspectives on Culture Teaching and Learning in the Language Curriculum, , Lange D.L., Klee C.A., Paige R.M., Yershova Y.A., (eds), University of Minnesota: Center for Advanced Research on Language Acquisition (CARLA); Falk, R., The decline of citizenship in an era of globalization (2000) Citizenship Studies, 4 (1), pp. 3-17; Figueroa, P., Citizenship education for a plural society (2000) Citizenship and Democracy in Schools: Diversity, Identity, Equality, , Osler A., (ed), Stoke on Trent, Sterling: Trendham Books Ltd; Giddens, A., Citizenship education in the global era (2000) Tomorrow's Citizens, , Pearce N., Hallgarten J., (eds), London: Institute for Public Policy Research; Guilherme, M., Intercultural competence (2000) Encyclopaedia of Language Teaching and Learning, , Byram M., (ed), London: Routledge; Guilherme, M., (2000) Critical cultural awareness: The critical dimension in foreign culture education, , University of Durham: School of Education, Unpublished PhD dissertation; Guilherme, M., The critical study of a foreign culture and citizenship education (2001) Anglo-Saxonica, 2, pp. 14-15; Guilherme, M., (2002) Critical Citizens for an Intercultural World: Foreign Language Education as Cultural Politics, , Clevedon: Multilingual Matters; Guilherme, M., Re-visioning Britishness: The teaching of democracy in British schools today (2003) Anglo-Saxonica, 19, pp. 199-205; Guilherme, M., The role of intercultural communication and interaction in modern language departments (2004) Anglo-Saxonica, 2 (21), pp. 119-138; Guilherme, M., Is there a role for critical pedagogy in language/culture studies?

Interviews with teachers confirm these tensions, revealing that the mindset of teachers may privilege a bicultural nationalist paradigm. Even where teachers have a clear commitment to intercultural perspectives, the implications of this may not be in tune with the teaching materials they find. The paper suggests that a dialogue with teachers of citizenship and multicultural education could help to provide a clearer perspective. In particular the concept of cosmopolitan citizenship, linking the local, the national and the global, may help teachers to progress from dominant nationalist paradigms. © 2007 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Citizenship; Cosmopolitan; Identities; Intercultural; Language policies; Language teachers",,,,,,,,,,"(1999) Standards for Foreign Language Learning: Preparing for the 21st Century, , http://www.actfl.org/files/public/execsumm.pdf, Yonkers, NY: American Council on the Teaching of Foreign Languages, Inc., Summary available on WWWat Accessed 18.5.06; Banks, J., (2002) Cultural Diversity and Education: Foundations, Curriculum and Teaching, , (4th edn), New York: John Wiley and Sons; Banks, J.A., McGee Banks, C.A., Cortes, C.E., Hahn, C., Merryfield, M., Moodley, K.A., Murphy-Shigematsu, S., Parker, W.C., (2005) Democracy and Diversity: Principles and Concepts for Educating Citizens in a Global Age, , Seattle, WA: Center for Multicultural Education, University of Washington; Beacco, J.-C., Byram, M., (2003) Guide for the Development of Language Education Policies in Europe: From Linguistic Diversity to Plurilingual Education.

Three different ways of developing a new state – in Tunisia, Algeria and Morocco – are the result of a new social and political landscape that is being designed in the Mediterranean basin: from a monarchy in Morocco legitimised by religion, to a liberal republic in Tunisia and a socialist-populist regime in Algeria. During the 1970s and 1980s, both the internal and the international situation forced these countries to confront the difficulties of economical and political central control. The lack of liberties, the economic crisis, the fight for power among the political and social forces inside these countries, and the Western Saharan conflict limited the development of the area. Two decades after independence, in the 1990s, we witness a political, cultural, economic and social crisis considered by scholars to be the catalyst of social processes such as the rise of Islamic fundamentalism or migration to Europe. The civil war in Algeria and the fight against Islamic terrorism are alibis for the authoritarian policies implemented by these regimes. Nowadays, limits on civil jobs, control of the Islamic presence in the political arena and new economic adjustment programmes related to European Union policy in the area, are all attempts to solve the critical situation. © 2007 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Maghreb; Recent history of maghreb; Sociopolitical",,,,,,,,,,"Abu-Lughod, L., Urbanization in the Arab world and the international system (1996) The Urban Transformation of the Developing World, pp. 184-208. , J.

Some tourists have selected their former recreational area as permanent place of residence while other people are choosing or are being forced into visiting or ‘consuming’ multiple places at regular or irregular intervals. These multiple practices of places and contexts, which entail new modes of living and bring different people together, could be regarded as ways of improving one’s communicative competence with other cultures. Drawing on field work conducted by linguists among retired or active British migrants to different regions of France and also on the work of sociologists, anthropologists, economists, geographers and tourism scholars in other countries of Europe or the world, this paper considers how the most mobile individuals in our modern societies shift contexts but seem to keep cultures at a standstill. © 2007 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Intercultural communication; Migration; Tourism",,,,,,,,,,"Allen, J., The English in Bulgaria (2006) ENHR International Conference, , Llubijana, Slovenia, 2-5 July; Aprile, S., Travel, tourism and migration seen through exile (2007) Going Abroad: Travel, Tourism and Migration.

The changes that were included in 1993 and especially in 2004 partially modify the philosophy of Islamic resources and give more freedom of action to women. At present, the Mudawwana Code – as well as the Tunisian Madjala Code from 1956 – displays a substantially different content from the rest of the family codes of the Muslim-Arab World. Morocco appears to have taken a clear position regarding the duty of the modern state to uphold equal citizenship, but nonetheless maintains – with rather weak arguments – a polygamous marriage that perpetuates women's subordination to men. © 2007 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Islamic law; Migrant muslim woman; Moroccan law; Muslim women",,,,,,,,,,"Abu-Lughod, L., Introducción.

With reference to Levinson’s notion of ‘activity type’, it argues that judgements by mentors as to what constitutes ‘allowable contributions’ on the part of ELAs are determined by the extent to which mentors themselves have internalised French State regulations. The degree of internalisation can thus serve as a means of distinguishing between ‘the political’ and ‘the cultural’. Awareness of this distinction and an insight into its social significance exemplifies what Spencer-Oatey describes more generally as a ‘sociopragmatic interactional principle’ or SIP. According to Spencer-Oatey, ‘SIPs’ are key elements in the successful management of ‚rapport’ in intercultural situations. By applying a methodology derived from Sinclair and Coulthard's analysis of oral discourse to recordings of ELA–mentor interactions, we identify specific sequences of moves that illustrate the relationship between political and cultural factors, SIPs and sociopragmatic misunderstandings in Anglo-French intercultural communication. © 2007 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Activity type; Allowable contribution; Pragmalinguistic; Rapport; Sociopragmatic; Sociopragmatic interactional principle (SIP)",,,,,,,,,,"Bourdieu, P., (1982) Ce Que Parler Veut Dire: L'économie Des échanges Linguistiques, , Paris: Fayard; Brislin, R., (1986) International Interactions: A Practical Guide, , Beverly Hills: Sage; Brown, P., Levinson, S., (1987) Politeness: Some Universals in Language Usage, , Cambridge: Cambridge University Press; Burton, D., (1980) Dialogue and Discourse, , London: Routledge and Kegan Paul; Coulthard, M., Montgomery, M., (1981) Studies in Discourse Analysis, , London: Routledge and Kegan Paul; D'iribarne, P., (1989) La Logique De L'honneur, , Paris: Du Seuil; Heritage, J., Analysing news interviews: Aspects of the production of talk for an ''overhearing'' audience (1985) Handbook of Discourse Analysis.

This discourse in the instance of its articulation realises and sustains Intercultural Communication epistemologically – as an academic field of social enquiry, and judgementally – as one which locates itself on a moral terrain. By adopting an ethical stance towards difference, the discourse of intercultural communication finds itself caught in a series of aporias, or performative contradictions, where interculturalists are projected simultaneously into positions of cultural relativism on the one hand and ideological totalism on the other. Such aporias arise because the theoretical premises upon which the discourse relies are problematic. We trace these thematics to a politics of presence operating within the discourse of intercultural communication and link this to questions of judgement and truth in the intercultural public sphere. We propose that the politics of presence be set aside in favour of an intercultural praxis which is oriented to responsibility rather than to truth. © 2007 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Presence; Relativism; Responsibility; Totality; Transformation; Truth",,,,,,,,,,"Adorno, T.W., (1973) Negative Dialectics, , New York: Continuum; Adorno, T.W., The actuality of philosophy (1977) Telos, 31, pp. 120-133; Adorno, T.W., (1978) Minima Moralia: Reflections from Damaged Life, , London: Verso; Atay, D., Reflections on the cultural dimension of language teaching (2005) Language and Intercultural Communication, 5 (3-4), pp. 222-236; Belz, J.A., Intercultural questioning, discovery and tension in Internet-mediated language learning partnerships (2005) Language and Intercultural Communication, 5 (1), pp. 3-39; Bielsa, E., Globalisation and translation (2005) Language and Intercultural Communication, 5 (2); Boylan, P., Language as representation, as agency as a new way of being (2000) Revolutions in Consciousness: Local Identities, Global Concerns in 'Languages and Intercultural Communication, pp. 165-174. , S.

My hypothesis is based on interviews with several groups of refugee children who have come to Norway at different times – Jewish children (1938), Hungarian children (1956), a Tibetan group (1964) and a multiethnic group (1990). Recognition is a central concept in understanding the fundamental processes that occur between refugee children and their new environments. These processes incorporate both the care offered by the primary care group and issues concerning intercultural communication, as well as government refugee policy. These processes necessarily have consequences for identity formation and the social integration of these children. © 2007 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Child care; Migration; Politics of identity; Recognition; Socialisation; Unaccompanied refugee minors",,,,,,,,,,"Bae, B., Waastad, J.E., (1992) Erkjennelse Og Anerkjennelse.

The Chinese tradition of translation has been characterised by fluency, but some scholars have recently advocated foreignisation for English to Chinese translation, and domestication for Chinese to English translation. This shift indicates that, as English has risen to global dominance, it is more respected as a source and target language in China, whose translation strategies are therefore subject to cultural variation. In defining and classifying language dominance, one needs to take into account not only the power of a language at the regional and world levels, but also the relative strength of one language in relation to the other.

In order to do this, I draw from post-structuralist and sociocultural approaches to language learning and L2 identity (e.g. Belz, 2002; Kinginger, 2004; Norton, 1997, 2000; Pavlenko, 2002, 2003) which assume that learners do not communicate in a social vacuum but acquire new roles, positions and vantage points from which they negotiate their L2 selves. More specifically, I argue the need for investigating language learners’ negotiations of legitimacy and agency in the L2 (Kramsch, 2003; Lantolf & Pavlenko, 2000) within a narrative perspective. As language learning and use occur socially, language learners need to be studied as negotiators in the relations of power that are established when entering into contact with the L2. Acquiring ‘audibility’ (Miller, 2004), the ‘right to speech’ (Bourdieu, 1977) and acquiring new positions in the L2 (Davies & Harré, 1990; Kramsch, 2003) are some of the issues that the L2 user faces when interacting in the target community of practice. The methodological framework put forward is exemplified through the study of several language learners' anecdotes extracted from a corpus of 20 learner interviews. © 2007 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Agency; Anecdotes; Identity; Legitimisation; Narrative; Socialisation; Voice",,,,,,,,,,"Belz, J.A., Second language play as a representation of the multicompetent self in foreign language study (2002) Journal of Language, Identity and Education, 1 (1), pp. 13-39; Bourdieu, P., The economics of linguistic exchanges (1977) Social Science Information XVI, pp. 637-668; Cook, V., Evidence for multicompetence (1992) Language Learning, 42, pp. 557-591; Davies, B., Harre, R., Positioning: The discursive production of selves (1990) Journal of the Theory of Social Behaviour, 20, pp. 43-65; De Fina, A., (2003) Identity in Narrative: A Study of Immigrant Discourse, , Amsterdam: John Benjamins; Gee, J.P., (1996) Social Linguistics and Literacies: Ideologies in Discourses, , 2nd edn).

As in certain branches of philosophy, language teaching has perhaps clung too long to the first of these notions of authenticity at the expense of the other. This paper reviews four key conceptualisations of authenticity which have emerged in the field of applied linguistics: text authenticity, authenticity of language competence, learner authenticity and classroom authenticity. If any of these types of authenticity is couched exclusively in terms of one usage or the other, it can lead to an impoverishment and objectification of the experience of language learning. Text authenticity can lead to a poverty of language; authenticity of competence can lead to a poverty of performance; learner authenticity can lead to a poverty of interpretation; classroom authenticity can lead to a poverty of communication. This paper proposes that a pedagogy of intercultural communication be informed by a more hybrid view of authenticity as a process of subjectification, derived from the Heideggerian concept of self-concern. © 2006 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Authenticity; English language teaching (ELT); Intercultural communication; Self-concern",,,,,,,,,,"Alptekin, C., Towards intercultural communicative competence in ELT (2002) ELT Journal, 56 (1), pp. 57-64; Bernstein, B., (2000) Pedagogy, Symbolic Control and Identity: Theory, Research, Critique, , Lanham: Rowman and Littlefield; Block, D., (2003) The Social Turn in Second Language Acquisition, , Edinburgh: EUP; Breen, M.P., Authenticity in the language classroom (1985) Applied Linguistics, 6 (1), pp. 60-70; Byram, M., (1989) Cultural Studies in Foreign Language Education, , Clevedon: Multilingual Matters; Canale, M., Swain, M., Theoretical bases of communicative approaches to second language teaching and testing (1980) Applied Linguistics, 1 (1), pp. 1-47; Cooper, D.E., (1983) Authenticity and Learning: Nietzsche's Educational Philosophy, , London: Routledge and Kegan Paul; Coppieters, R., Competence differences between native and near-native speakers (1987) Language, 63 (3), pp. 544-573; Gavioli, L., Aston, G., Enriching reality: Language corpora in language pedagogy (2001) ELT Journal, 55 (3), pp. 238-246; Gilmore, A., A comparison of textbook and authentic interactions (2004) ELT Journal, 58 (4), pp. 363-374; Graddol, D., The Future of English?

Since its origins in comparative literature, the field has moved beyond the narrow disciplinary confines of the humanities, with their predominantly qualitative methodology, and become truly interdisciplinary. This happened in two steps. First, by bringing history into the picture, thereby adding a strong diachronical approach and additional elements of theory. Secondly, by attracting the interest of social scientists–in the main psychologists, sociologists, and social anthropologists–and, in the process, adding further theoretical frameworks and quantitative methodologies typically absent from the humanities. This has resulted in a whole array of insights and models. Specialists aside, however, mainstream scholars are still largely unaware of the field's essential notions, insights, models, disciplinary composition and claims to relevance.

Plurilingualism and intercomprehension are concepts of particular importance in the multilingual and multicultural European context. These are explicit aims and requirements of the European Union when identifying and pursuing the fundamental objectives of social cohesion, by promoting the definition of a composite social identity that respects cultural diversity in establishing ‘Europeanness’. In this context, we analyse the new approaches to the concept of intercomprehension developed within the ‘EU&I–European Awareness and Intercomprehension’ project (Lingua 1), listing and describing the various dimensions and components which it comprises. The EU&I project builds on the plurilingual and pluricultural competence to root it in intercomprehension practices (focusing on receptive skills), when the subjects come in contact with foreign languages they have not learnt. The innovative approach of EU&I lies in the relevance confered to the textual and sociocultural dimensions of intercomprehension, as it stems from both linguistic transfers and textual and socio-cultural experience and knowledge. © 2006 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Discursive competence; Europe; European language policies; Intercomprehension; Plurilingualism",,,,,,,,,,"Alred, G., Byram, M., Fleming, M., (2002) Intercultural Experience and Education, , Clevedon: Multilingual Matters; Beacco, J.-C., Byram, M., (2003) Guide for the Development of Language Education Policies in Europe: From Linguistic Diversity to Plurilingual Education (Draft 1 (rev.)

In Hong Kong, as elsewhere in the world, the local television companies frequently buy successful television programmes from, for example, the USA or Britain with the expectation that they will be similarly successful in Hong Kong. One such example in Hong Kong was a quiz show that was bought from a British television company and then replicated in Hong Kong using local Hong Kong Chinese as the contestants and quiz show host. This show has been a huge success in Britain and it was anticipated that this success would be repeated in Hong Kong by following exactly the same format and presentation. In fact, this did not turn out to be the case. Our analysis helps to reveal the problems experienced and a cross-cultural analysis offers explanations for them. It is shown that media communication can be perceived very differently across different cultures and the findings demonstrate that a better understanding of the dynamics of cross-cultural and intercultural communication would be useful for our television programmers and others working in the mass media. © 2005 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","Cross-cultural communication; Discourse intonation; Media communication; Quiz show in Hong Kong; The weakest link",,,,,,,,,,"(2003) Annual Report and Accounts; (2005) The Weakest Link: Your Views, 1 (2). , http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/reviews/1285166.stm, On WWW at, Accessed; Bond, M.H., (1986) The Psychology of the Chinese People, , Hong Kong: Oxford University Press; Bond, M.H., Leung, L., Wan, K.C., How does cultural collectivism operate?

It suggests that a combined effect of factors such as the traditional concept of ‘Germanness’, peculiarities of Russian Germans' ‘cultural identity’ and certain aspects of German language policy withrespect to resettlement have prompted the emergence and development of discourses that are linked to thedeficiency of social contacts between Russian Germans and native Germans. This paper focuseson the Russian German–native German discourse that is an intrinsic part of such contacts. It argues that broad political and social contexts influence the process of interaction indirectly by becoming part of the interlocutors' knowledge. Fieldwork provides empirical evidence forsuch an influence. A number of communicative settings are analysed in depth, using results of in-depth interviews, observations and authentic conversations. On the basis of this analysis, the current paper demonstrates how the discourses that stem from controversies in the language policy can interfere with face-to-face interactions between Russian Germans and native Germans in various social settings at the microlevel and therefore have an impact on the way Russian German–native German discourse is shaped. © 2005 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","Discourse; Ethnic Germans; Face-to-face interaction; Language policy; Migration; Social knowledge",,,,,,,,,,"Baaden, A., (1997) Aussiedler Migration: Historische Und Aktuelle Entwicklungen, , Berlin: Berlin Verlag; Baaden, A., (1997) Konzepte Und Modelle Zur Integration Von Aussiedlern, , Berlin: Berlin Verlag; Bade, K., Oltmer, J., (1999) Aussiedler: Deutsche Einwanderer Aus Osteuropa, , Osnabrück: Univ.-Verlag Rasch; Beck, U., Deutsche Lebenslügen.

The texts that Ondaatje rewrites in his poems are visual, written, oral and performative. By putting them side by side in his text, in a Derridean fashion, he deconstructs the concept of logocentrism, as, in his own text, the written word will have no pre-eminence among the other types of writing. In turn, their juxtaposition makes them function as ‘multimodal texts’, i.e. ‘texts in which the verbal and visual modes closely interact’ (Menezes de Souza, 2003: 40) and that, in turn, result in a ‘multimodal perspective’ on Sri Lankan culture. Ondaatje's rewriting of these texts stands as an act of cultural translation. © 2006 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Alphabet; History; Languages; Manuscript",,,,,,,,,,"Bhaba, H., (1994) The Location of Culture, , London: Routledge; Derrida, J., (1976) [1967] of Grammatology, , Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press; Derrida, J., (1992) Acts of Literature, , New York and London: Routledge; Menezes De Souza, L.M.T., De a estoria a historia: A escrita indigena no Brasil (2001) Revista Da Biblioteca Mario De Andrade.

Fifteen first-year Chinese university students were interviewed and participated in focus groups. The findings indicated that the Chinese students' rules for communication – face negotiation, and maintaining roles, harmony and relationships – were not compatible with the New Zealand rules for competent classroom communication. Therefore, there is a need for a critical turn that is culture-and context-specific, and exposes power relations when theorising and investigating ICC. © 2005 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","Chinese communication; Chinese students/learners; Intercultural communication competence; International education",,,,,,,,,,"Ballard, B., Clanchy, J., (1997) Teaching International Students: A Brief Guide for Lecturers and Supervisors, , Deakin, ACT: IDP Education Australia; Barker, M., Intercultural adjustment and communication (1990) Oriented for Success, pp. 6-15. , M.

In this study, informed by feminist poststructuralist theory, we can see the highly context-sensitive nature of the gendered practices and the corresponding outcomes of language learning and language contact. The study generalises from the assumptions of previous feminist poststructuralist studies on the ideologies of gender and language and integrates these with intercultural transformation theory. This theoretical framework is used to explain L2 learners‘/users’ reconstruction and transformation of gendered performance during their discursive reestablishment of social identities in heterogeneous sociocultural contexts. The dynamic and constantly changing nature of L2 learners' gendered identity has significant implications for second language educators, by ‘open(ing) up possibility for educational intervention’ (Peirce, 1995: 15). The paper concludes by suggesting how school instructions might mitigate the powerful social factorsthat retard L2 learners' acquisition in certain communities, as well as how educators can facilitate L2 learners' cross-cultural transformation to promote their social identity renegotiation and reestablishment to achieve legitimate membership during their second language socialisation. © 2005 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","Gender; Identity; Intercultural transformation; Second language",,,,,,,,,,"Agar, M., (1994) Language Shock: Understanding the Culture of Conversation, , New York: William Morrow; Baker, C.S., Macintyre, D.P., The role of gender and immersion in communication and second language orientations (2000) Language Learning, 31; Barrett, R., Indexing polyphonous identity in the speech of African America drag queens (1999) Reinventing Identities: The Gendered Self in Discourse, pp. 313-331. , M.

Following Brown and Gilman (1960), research studies of address terms have been extended to several cultural settings. This study contributes to this fertile area of sociolinguistic studies by describing the address terms used among undergraduates in an English-medium university in Ghana. Two sets of data collected from participant and nonparticipant observation and interviews constitute the primary source of data, supplemented by intuition. Analysis and discussion of this study point to three key findings. First, Ghanaian students use four major groups of address terms. The second finding relates to the use of the reported modes of address, namely, personal names, titles, descriptive terms and catch phrases to reflect and construct the individual and social identity of students. The final point is the use of modes of address to reflect a warm and vivacious culture. These findings have implication for theory and intercultural communication. © 2005 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","Academic english; Address terms; Communicative domains; Names; Titles",,,,,,,,,,"Afful, J.B.A., (1998) The Relationship between Language and Culture in Ghana: A Comparative Study of Address Terms in Three Speech Communities in Cape Coast, , Unpublished MPhil Dissertation, University of Cape Coast; Agyekum, K., Honorifics and status indexing in Akan communication (2003) Multilingual and Multicultural Development, 24 (5), pp. 369-385; Akrofi, A.K., Owusu-Ansah, L.K., Place and family names of European origin in the Cape Coast-Elmina Area of Ghana.

Nous proposons ensuite le Portfolio Européen des Langues (PEL) comme un cadre de référence utile pour les apprenants et les enseignants, servant á noter et décrire les expériences interculturelles et á suivre la prise de conscience et le développement des attitudes des jeunes éléves dans ce domaine.

To this end, the general relationship between language and power is examined in an initial theoretical section and subsequently probed from a practical viewpoint by reporting on the results yielded in a study recently carried out in Spain within the international research project ICOPROMO (Intercultural Competence for Professional Mobility). After characterising the latter and describing the sample of subjects who have integrated into the Spanish part of the study, this paper goes on to reflect their view of power in multicultural teams, with a clear focus on the relationship between mastery of the official team language and influence in such a team. The data obtained carries relevant implications, such as the need to consider language an integral component in current models of intercultural communicative competence or the significance of incorporating intercultural training in foreign language learning. © 2005 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","Influence; Language; Multicultural teams; Power",,,,,,,,,,"Breidbach, S., (2003) Plurilingualism, Democratic Citizenship in Europe and the Role of English, , Strasbourg: Council of Europe; Chevrier, S., Cross-cultural management in multinational project groups (2003) Journal of World Business, 38 (2), pp. 141-149; Corbett, J., (2003) An Intercultural Approach to English Language Teaching, , Clevedon: Multilingual Matters; Crystal, D., (1997) English as a Global Language, , Cambridge: Cambridge University Press; Ferner, A., Edwards, P., Sisson, K., Coming unstuck?

Such telecollaborative, intercultural exchanges are becoming increasingly more common as a means of providing students at one location with cost-effective access to distally located representatives of the languaculture under study (Agar, 1994); nevertheless, researchers have not paid close attention to the linguistic characterisation of the development of IC in such partnerships, despite the fact that text- based computer-mediated communication currently constitutes the primary means of telecollaborative interaction. In his well-known model of IC, Byram (1997) links the use of appropriate questioning techniques to the operation of skills of discovery, one means by which speakers in intercultural encounters may develop impressions and attitudes of one another. I examine the ways in which the number, type, chronological placement and content of the questions posed by participants each side of a trans-Atlantic exchange may influence the processes of impression formation in intercultural personal relationship building. Suggestions are made for ways in which research on computer-mediated relationship building in communication studies and foreign language education may enrich one another. © 2005 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","Applied linguistics; Computer-assisted language learning (CALL); German; Intercultural communication; Intercultural misunderstanding; Telecollaboration",,,,,,,,,,"Abrams, A., The effect of synchronous and asynchronous CMC on oral performance in German (2003) The Modern Language Journal, 87 (2), pp. 157-167; Agar, M., (1994) Language Shock: Understanding the Culture of Conversation, , New York: William Morrow; Altman, I., Taylor, D., (1973) Social Penetration: The Development of Interpersonal Relationships, , New York: Holt, Rinehart, and Winston; Bauer, B., De Benedette, L., Furstenberg, G., Levet, S., Waryn, S., Computer-mediated intercultural foreign language education: The Cultura project Internet-Mediated Intercultural Foreign Language Education, , to appear, In J.A.

While the socioinstitutional dimension of German–American exchanges has already benefited from extensive study in the literature, this paper focuses on the particular issues and problems which arise in the Spanish–American context and illustrates the strategies available to teachers in these countries to overcome these constraints. The outcomes of the research carried out here illustrate the need for telecollaborative models of exchange to be adaptable to different contexts of use. Furthermore, the research also underlines the necessity for online exchanges to offer learners the opportunity to explore with their partners the stereotypes and prejudices which each group may hold about the target culture. © 2005 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,,"Appel, C., Mullen, T., Pedagogical considerations for a web-based tandem language learning environment.

It is quite common that journalists themselves perform translations in their text production processes. Online media have added new possibilties to these processes. This paper looks at the transfer between print and online media texts from the point of view of translation. On the basis of case studies of English translations made available online by Spiegel International, the text production practice and its reflection in the linguistic structure of the translations is illustrated. The declared aim of putting English translations on the Spiegel website is to bring its ‘unique voice’ to English-speaking readers. This paper argues that this ‘unique voice’ will not be seen by the readers in the actual linguistic make-up of the texts, but that it is as a result of the text selection process that English-speaking readers can get access to a different point of view.übersetzen ist ein reguläres Phänomen der journalistischen Textproduktion, auch wenn dies nicht immer explizit gemacht ist, und es sind oft die Journalisten selbst, die übersetzungen anfertigen. In diesem Artikel wird der Transferprozess von Druck- zu Onlineversionen von Texten vom Standpunkt der Translationswissenschaft aus untersucht. Anhand einer Fallstudie, eine Analyse englischer übersetzungen auf der Spiegel International Webseite, werden die Textproduktionsprozesse sowie deren Niederschlag in der sprachlichen Struktur der übersetzungen illustriert. Englische übersetzungen werden auf der Spiegel Webseite bereitgestellt mit dem erklärten Ziel, die ‘spezifische Stimme’ des Spiegel englischsprachigen Lesern zugänglich zu machen. In diesem Beitrag wird argumentiert, dass die Leser diese ‘spezifische Stimme’ nicht in den Textstrukturen selbst sehen können. Es ist vielmehr das Textauswahlverfahren, das englischsprachigen Lesern Zugang zu einem anderem Standpunkt verschafft. © 2005 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","Intertextuality; Media translation; Spiegel international",,,,,,,,,,"Beaugrande, R.D., Dressler, W., (1981) Introduction to Text Linguistics, , London: Longman; Brinker, K., (1985) Linguistische Textanalyse, , Berlin: Erich Schmidt; Ekstrom, M., Politicians interviewed on television news (2001) Discourse & Society, 12 (5), pp. 563-584; Fairclough, N., (1995) Critical Discourse Analysis, , London: Longman; Fairclough, N., Wodak, R., Critical discourse analysis (1997) Discourse Studies: A Multidisciplinary Introduction.

These developments, which result in the increased mobility of people and objects and a heightened contact between different linguistic communities (mass tourism, migration, information and media flows) signal, in spite of the predominance of English as a global lingua franca, an exponential growth in the significance of translation, which becomes a key mediator of global communication. Yet language and translation have been systematically neglected in the current literature on globalisation. This paper critically examines current theories ofglobalisation and interrogates their lack of attention towards translation. It formulates an attempt to understand the significance of translation in a global context, conceptualising its analytical place in globalisation theory and its key role in the articulation of the global and the local.La superació de les barreres espacials i la centralitat del coneixement i de la informació sóndues característiques fonamentals de la globalització.

This paper serves as a first-hand account of the work of a television news translator – a reflection on the author's five years experience in television and newspaper newsrooms. With an anecdotal start, the author revisits the routine in the newsroom to see how international news is processed and re-processed before being televised to the local audience. The author then attempts to deconstruct the process and strategies involved by looking into the concept of rewriting as opposed to translation, and how recent research perceives this sort of language transformation and manipulation in the fast-paced television newsroom. The linkage between translation and interpreting in the media context is another subject worth delving into in the future. In addition to the freedom a translator enjoys in the newsroom and its confines, this paper deals with journalistic hierarchy which reflects how news translators see themselves and how they are perceived, in the hope that the status of the translator can be elevated. © 2005 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","Broadcast media; International news translation; Interpreting; Rewriting; Synthesis; Television news",,,,,,,,,,"Barker, C., (1997) Global Television: An Introduction, , Malden, MA: Blackwell Publishers; Bassnett, S., What exactly did Saddam say?

News texts are global products which are distributed through a localisation process involving not only reception by locales of a given text, but also the simultaneous production of more versions of a same news report and the production of a new target text of which translation is only a part and not the translator-journalist's goal. Such a text is tailored for ‘sub-locales’ whose identity is political as well as linguistic. The case of the Italian press is typical, as it shows how a global news report is not only interlinguistically localised into the Italian locale, but also intralinguistically adapted to suit readers' political leanings within the same linguistic locale.Considerata la particolare natura dei testi giornalistici, l'adozione di un modello teorico come la localizzazione piuttosto che teorie convenzionali sulla traduzione sembra meglio descrivere sia la natura commerciale della distribuzione delle notizie che la scala globale su cui avviene tale processo. I testi giornalistici sono prodotti globali distribuiti attraverso un processo di localizzazione che implica non solo la ricezione di un determinato testo da parte di una ‘locale’ (contesto), ma anche la produzione simultanea di piú versioni di uno stesso comunicato stampa e la produzione di nuovo testo di arrivo di cui la traduzione é solo una parte e non l‘obbiettivo del giornalista/traduttore. Tale testo viene costruito su misura per delle rispettive ‘sub-locali’ la cui identitá é politica oltre che linguistica. Il caso della stampa italiana é rappresentativo poiché illustra come un testo giornalistico globale non solo sia localizzato ‘interlinguisticamente’ in italiano, ma anche tradotto ‘intralinguisticamente’ perché si adattati all‘orientamento politicodei suoi lettori. © 2005 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","Global news flow; Italian newspapers; Objectivity; Translation; Tribalisation",,,,,,,,,,"Annan, K., (2004) Accessed 27.03.2005, , http://www.un.org/apps/sg/offthecuff.asp?nidB 587, New York, 18 May 2004 - Secretary-General's press encounter with Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi of Italy On WWW at; Bassnett, S., (2002) Translation Studies, , London: Routledge; Bassnett, S., Trusting reporter: What exactly did Saddam say?

The author suggests that these debates become redundant, if not counter-productive inthe field of news translation, where the demands of the target audience, the time constraints and the hybrid nature of the linguistic processes involved in creating global news approximate more closely to what happens in interpreting, where the target needs take precedence and acculturation becomes the dominant strategy. The paper also raises a fundamental question about the nature of news translation, and asks whether we have an adequate definition of the whole, complex process. The argument is illustrated by two case studies: translated transcripts of the first court appearance of Saddam Hussein and a statement issued by al Qaida following the terrorist bombing of the British consulate in Istanbul in November 2003. Partendo da un'indagine diacronica sul dibattito intorno al concetto di acculturazionenella storia della traduzione, l'autore esamina la problematica ideologicadella traduzione di testi giornalistici, sostenendo che le dominanti strategietraduttologiche s'avvicinano piú alla metodologia adoperata da intepreti che a quella adoperata da traduttori di testi letterari. Gli elementi contestuali insieme alle aspettative culturali fanno sí che l'acculturazione sia il metodo preferito dalla traduzione giornalistica. Si pone il problema di come definire la traduzione giornalistica oltre al problema dell'applicabilitá della terminologia esistente nel campo di translation studies. Come esempi, vengono considerati due testi tratti da giornali inglesi, nei quali la rettorica di Saddam Hussein é acculturata per dati lettori. © 2005 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","Acculturation; Authenticity; Foreignisation; News translation; Target readership",,,,,,,,,,"Bassnett, S., What exactly did Saddam say?

To this aim it would make sense to be introduced at a very early age to elements of language and culture from neighbouring countries or immigrant populations. Plurilingualism is the only means to maintain linguistic diversity, which, in turn, empowers people and enhances their creativity and problem-solving skills.Obwohl das Konzept der Mehrsprachigkeit nicht wirklich neu ist, erscheint es der Autorin als geeignetes Mittel für die Bü rgerInnen Europas zur Entwicklung einer europäischen Identität. Gleichzeitig trägt Mehrsprachigkeit zum Abbau von kulturellen und sogar genetischen Schranken bei. Allerdings sollte bereits im Vorschulalter verstärkt damit begonnen werden, bewusste kulturelle und sprachliche Erfahrungen mit den Kulturen der Nachbarstaaten oder größerer Immigrantengruppen zu machen. Mehrsprachigkeit ist der einzig mögliche Garant fü r Sprachenvielfalt.

Born in the Handsworth district of Birmingham, a major centre of Caribbean and South Asian migration, this multilingual, border-crossing, urban youth appropriates the ‘patwa’ language of Jamaicans and mixes this with his own Punjabi. What results is a polyvocal, rajamuffin sound that illustrates the ways in which the creolisation process, more familiarly studied in the context of the colonies of Britain, assumes new dynamics in the very belly of the beast of Empire. Apache Indian declares: ‘Me a push reggae music to a different body/A next nation and a next country.’ The DJ’s ‘nation’ encompasses an expansive body of South Asian/West Indian diasporic communities and others far beyond his country of birth. Having discovered at home in Handsworth models of performative excellence within a distinctly Caribbean idiom, Apache Indian, like Nahki in Japan, Snow in Canada, Bigga Haitian in New York, Admiral T in Guadeloupe and Gentleman in Germany, crisscrosses cultural borders, demonstrating the infinite capacity for adaptation of transnational Jamaican popular culture as it accommodates local needs in its global spread. © 2004 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","Black British; Creolisation; Dancehall; Reggae",,,,,,,,,,"(1995) Make Way for the Indian, 162 (539). , Mango; (1993) No Reservations, , Island Records, CID 8001 514; (1997) Real People, , Warner Music Sweden, 3984 204562; (2000) Karma, , Sunset Records, SRCD011; The Best of Apache Waria, 1. , Waria Productions, AWCD-01; Chaudhury, V., Enter the Rajamuffins (1995) The Guardian, 4. , Tuesday September 19; Cooper, C., Devonish, H., Banking on Caribbean talent: Intellectual property rights and the entertainment industry, unpublished paper presented at the (1995) Business, , Ocho Rios, Jamaica, June, 1995; Hall, S., What is this ð lack’in Black popular culture?

Identity is taken to be narrative in performance, one element of which, intercultural allusion, serves pragmatically to broker the transcultured subject's insertion into the host culture. The paper then shows how Othello’s narratives of identity in Shakespeare’s tragedy are mimetic of both identity as performance and of the strategic deployment of intercultural allusion. The article concludes with a consideration of Caryl Phillips’s reaction to the Othello icon of exotic ethnicity in his meditative novel The Nature of Blood This reaction forms part of Phillips’s own identity narrative and is illustrative of how a real person’s identity is also reliant upon allusion – often in spite of itself. © 2004 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","Caryl Phillips; Identity narrative; Intercultural allusion; Othello; Shakespeare",,,,,,,,,,"Bell, C.R., Worlds within.

In his Essay on the Origin of Language Herder focuses on language as the specifically human trait that distinguishes humanity from all other species on the one hand and the creator of human differences and diversity of cultures on the other hand. The crucial issue for Herder’s aesthetics of language is the reception process whereby a particular experience acquires linguistic form. This process functions in the origin of language and in the translation from one language to another in a similar way. In both cases, the particular environmental forces that are significant in the mind of the receiver become crucial for the shaping of the final linguistic or narrative construct being received. If this is true, then cases of transcultural narrative are not examples of the creation of a ‘common’ narrative. Rather, narrative ‘proliferates’ across cultures by multiplying itself in a process that is determined by a certain confluence of interests in two or more cultures but not a reproduction of identical narrative forms, even in the case of direct translation. © 2004 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","Affect; Johann gottfried herder; Multiculturalism; Origin of language; Transcultural narrative; Translation",,,,,,,,,,"Aarsleff, H., (1982) From Locke to Saussure: Essays on the Study of Language and Intellectual History, , Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press; Arens, K., Translators who are not traitors: Herder's and Lessing's enlightenments (2000) Herder Jahrbuch 2000: Studien Zum 18.

This article analyses 26 EFL textbooks used in Japan, to discover what kind of environmental education they offer, and what this says about intercultural communication in the teaching/learning process. The results show how textbooks, by concentrating mainly on technical solutions to environmental problems, fail to open to criticism the cultural values at the heart of the environmental crisis, and direct attention away from important alternatives rooted in the deep ecological insights of traditional Japanese culture. The conclusion discusses ways to move away from unidirectional transfer of technical knowledge, towards a productive intercultural dialogue on ecological issues. © 2004 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","Deep ecology; Discourse; Environmentalism; Intercultural communication; Japan",,,,,,,,,,"Allen, J., (1951) As a Man Thinketh, , New York: Peter Pauper Press; Bowers, F., (1996) The Classic Tradition of Haiku, , New York: Dover; Chouliaraki, L., Fairclough, N., (1999) Discourse in Late Modernity, , Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press; Conn, S., When the Earth hurts, who responds?

Implicit to the notion of the Legion as refuge and fellow legionnaires as a band of brothers are narratives of identity and difference grounded in mutual or asymmetrical attributions of inside versus outside, familiarity versus alienness, self versus other. The intention is to show how the external forces of nationalism and ethnicity during conflicts impact upon the internalised nationalism and ethnicity of the Legion’s peacetime communal balance. This dialectical tension can lead to a band of brothers composed of Cains and Abels. © 2004 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","Foreign legion; Group boundaries; Identity discourse",,,,,,,,,,"Allen, V.L., Wilder, D.A., Categorization, belief similarity and intergroup discrimination (1975) Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 32; Anderson, B., (1991) Imagined Communities: Reflections on the Origin and Spread of Nationalism (Revised Edition), , London and NY: Verso; Beccaria, L., (1988) Helie De Saint-Marc, , Paris: Firmin-Didot; Benhabib, S., (1992) Situating the Self, , New York: Routledge; Bergot, E., The history of the Legion (1984) French Foreign Legion: The inside Story of The World Famous Fighting Force, , J.R.

Based on Bhabha’s insights that mainstream culture needs intellectual and artistic infusion from the margins of a society in order to remain vital; and that cultural production itself is a continuous performative development, I analyse Demirkan’s proposals for cultural integration that avoids assimilation. Demirkan lets the main character of Schwarzer Tee assert her own bicultural place both within and against her family and German society. This largely autobiographical narrative gives the reader a tentative understanding as to how the Turkish-German culture-on-the-margins is an essential and productive part of German culture. Demirkan develops a new, strong and confident type of heroine in her novel and through this new figure accomplishes two goals.

Similarly to Kadare, Radichkov and Pavić regard the encounter between two cultures as a syncopal dialogue. In contrast to Radichkov, Kadare and Pavić, Vladova believes that the foreign is not strange, and that the imbalance in the dialogue between east and west could be avoided. The dictionary, a tool of intercultural discourse, structures Pavić’s Dictionary of the Khazars, a reservoir of reshaped pieces of past knowledge which question Balkan cultural identities. The Balkan intercultural narrative has gradually changed from an exploration that questions the (non)translatability of cultures to an intercultural dialogue, in which the classical image of the traveller has been replaced by e-mail writers, whose virtual voices make them ideal interlocutors in a globalising world. © 2004 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","(non)translatability; Intercultural dialogue; Lexicon novel; Travel account",,,,,,,,,,"Bet-El, I.R., Unimagined communities: The power of memory and the conflict in the former Yugoslavia (2002) Memory and Power in Post-War Europe.

He represents an unusually extreme case of multiple identity in a transnational context. Despite this, Gary’s literary œuvre is not much concerned with the problem of identity. It exhibits instead a tension between protest at the inhumanity of men and the need to adapt to changing historical circumstances. The dialectic between opposition and adaptation is exemplified by the textual history of Éducation européenne.First published in wartime Britain, then amended for publication in Liberation France, then rewritten in cold war California, it was finally given a ‘definitive’ hybrid version in French. The same message is pursued in all versions but from different author-positions. It is argued that the revisions serve to dedramatise the psychological question of identity, and to redirect attention to the moral aims of writing fiction. © 2004 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","Adaptation; Assimilation; Moral issues in fiction; Rewriting; Romain Gary; Transnational writing; Èducation européenne",,,,,,,,,,"Ajar, E., (1974) Gros-Câlin, , Paris: Mercure de France; Ajar, E., (1975) La Vie Devant Soi, , Paris: Mercure de France; Ajar, E., (1976) Pseudo, , Paris: Mercure de France; Ajar, E., (1980) L'angoisse Du Roi Salomon, , Paris: Mercure de France; Ajar, E., (1981) Vie Et Mort D'emile Ajar, , Paris: Gallimard; Anissimov, M., (2004) Romain Gary, Le Caméléon, , Paris: Denoel; Bayard, P., (1990) Il était Deux Fois Romain Gary, , Paris: PUF; Bellos, D., Quelle Education européenne ?

In this paper it is shown that both the spread of the English language and the increasing dominance of a management discourse are based on a series of tacit assumptions and imbued with specific ideologies. When occurring together, they create a hegemonic field of forces which encourages the emergence of identities in line with neoliberal market economies. In order to ‘break open’ such tacit assumptions and ideologies, it is suggested that a critical management pedagogy needs to take a linguistic turn in order to instil in students a sense of agency, initiative and possibility as well as a sense of structure, context and constraint. © 2004 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","English; Globalisation; Ideology; Management discourse",,,,,,,,,,"Alvesson, M., Karremann, D., Taking the linguistic turn in organizational research.

In addition to ideas from feminist literary theory, philosophy, modern history and psychoanalysis, I am especially concerned to exploit the striking points of contact between the fields of Intercultural Communication, critical pedagogy and progressive theology. The stance I take towards interculturality upholds the role of the experiential and autobiographical (i.e. the local and personal) in engaging, both as scholars and as everyday communicators, with a more broadly, critically conceived notion of difference. © 2004 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","Autobiography; Critical; Difference; Intercultural communication; Pedagogy; Religion",,,,,,,,,,"Billig, M., Simons, H.W., Introduction (1994) After Postmodernism: Reconstructing Ideology Critique (Pp, , H.W.

This may at first seem a counter-intuitive goal with connotations of constraint and convergence rather than opening up and diversity. However, what is often not taken into account in the notion of opening up new spaces of critique or new 'languages' is that those new critical 'languages' operate in a dominant materially concrete, linguistic language, namely English. The opportunity to manipulate the representational resources of English therefore is a necessary pedagogical goal if one wants to open up participation in academic literacy practices to a wider selection of people than is currently the case. By on the one hand, raising awareness of subjectification into the rhetorical norms of academic writing by pointing up their historical construction, and on the other, looking at an example of a Korean PhD student working with the theoretical discourses of post-colonialism and psychoanalysis in English, I hope to refigure the prevailing assumptions on attention to form in written English. © 2003 J.

Youth invokes compassion and understanding, which are crucial to shaping the civic imagination. The emphasis on young people's experience is important because it foregrounds the relationship between power and the lived realities shaped by material relations of power. More specifically, young people provide a more crucial lens through which hegemony can be analysed, compassion mobilised, and politics engaged beyond local interests and national boundaies. Educators need a new language in which young people are not detached from politics but become central to any transformative notion of pedagogy conceived in terms of social and public responsibility. © 2003 H.A.

As Graddol and others note, these forces of globalisation have rendered the notion of a homogeneity of forms and patterns of communication in English almost defunct in the epicentres of ‘pluricentric’ Englishes. The paper argues that speech intelligibility as a construct has to be re-examined in relation to the forces of globalisation that push towards intercultural communication in these sites of world, new or multiple Englishes by presenting evidence from the localised and the globalised workplace that demonstrates this phenomenon. © 2002 by Taylor nad Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,,"Abercrombie, D., Teaching pronunciation (1949) English Language Teaching, 3, pp. 113-122; Bamgbose, A., Torn between the norms: Innovations in World Englishes (1998) World Englishes, 17 (1), pp. 1-14; Cathford, J.C., Intelligibility (1950) English Language Teaching, 5 (1), pp. 7-15; Cathford, J.C., Phonetics and the teaching of pronunciation.

People’s perceptions, beliefs and attitudes are undoubtedly embedded in the mental programming of culture (Hofstede, 1980).Hofstede (1993: 81) notes that much of the academic field of management (including organisational behaviour) is an ‘American invention’. Many of the concepts and theories themselves are derivative of the American culture and language. While the constructs and theories may apply in other cultures, as some researchers in the field of organisational behaviour (e.g. Cheung and Rensvold, 1999; Mullen, 1995; Riordan and Vandenberg, 1994) suggest the magnitude, dimensionality, dynamics and even meaning may vary. When doing cross-cultural research on phenomena that are rooted within a given culture, we must proceed with caution (Weidong, 1999). This paper raises the question of how to improve cross-cultural research of organisational constructs and theories derived from a specific culture. The approach advocated here is one that explicitly considers both culture and language. This paper reviews traditional positivist/post-positivist methodology and then proposes grounded theoretic qualitative methods as an alternative (Locke, 2001; Strauss and Corbin, 1998). Grounded theory provides the advantage of not stripping cultural context from the analysis. © 2003 by Taylor nad Francis Group, LLC.","Cross-cultural management; Grounded theory; Research methods",,,,,,,,,,"Asselin, G., Mastron, R., (2001) Au Contraire!

The analysis is centred on modes of appropriation of Shakespeare andChekhov in Denmark. The argument relies on a broader statistical investigation into repertoire development, but focuses on a detailed presentation of four productions from the 2001/2002 season, in which Shakespeare and Chekhov are shown to be treated on the Danish stage in ways that have a bearing on the difference in developmental phases of a Russian and English Cultural Self vis-à-vis Denmark. All aspects of performing, from language to spectacle and the broader historical background, are considered, to ensure that a contextualised case study of interculturalcommunication can provide the basis for a discussion of the applications, as well as implications, of the Transcultured Self, not merely for a separate Culture, but also for the site it employs to stage it-Self, namely, the theatre. © 2003 by Taylor nad Francis Group, LLC.","Cultural self; Culture; Drama; Intercultural theatre",,,,,,,,,,"Aaltonen, S., (1996) Acculturation of the Other: Irish Milieux in Finnish Drama Translation, , Finland: Joensuu University Press; Bakhtin, M., Response to a question from the NovyMir editorial stuff (1986) Speech Genres and Other Late Essays, , C.

To do this, I will discuss how some theoretical and pedagogical principles from Intercultural Learning, Cultural Studies and Second Language Acquisition throw light on the teaching of culture at the outset of foreign language learning. While it is widely recognised that culture and language occur in tandem, there is a dearth of examples of how reflection about the target culture can be introduced in the adult beginners’ language learning context. In this paper I will argue that the notion of culture as a negotiable entity can be introduced at the outset of language learning. The role of cultural identity and subjectivity in texts are the two key concepts on which this argument will be built. I will then describe how these ideas can be transferred to three different aspects of language teaching methodology: the need to portray heterogeneous national cultures and other markers of cultural identity, objectivity vs. subjectivity in texts, and the creation of fictional personal testimonies to experience the target culture. In order to illustrate these points, examples from two beginners’ Spanish course books will be provided. © 2003 by Taylor nad Francis Group, LLC.","Adult language learners; Beginners; Cultural identity; Personal accounts; Subjectivity",,,,,,,,,,"Bassnett, S., Introduction: Studying British cultures (1997) Studying British Cultures: An Introduction, pp. xxviixiii-xxvii. , S.

Taking a humanist and Bergsonian view, it presents three transcultured selves from modern European culture to explore a model of cultural identity based on the idea of being in becoming. Foreign language acquisition is viewed as integral to the ideal of an enlarging consciousness which comes to embrace the ‘other’ through accommodating newways of seeing and responding to the world. A pedagogical model is proposed for exploring this conception, centred on the emerging genre of border-writing and the establishment of a new literary canon. © 2003 by Taylor nad Francis Group, LLC.","Acculturation; Co-consciousness; Empathy; Inter-thinking; Languaculture; Utopia",,,,,,,,,,"Agar, M., (1994) Language Shock: Understanding the Culture of Conversation, , New York: WM Morrow; Agar, M., (1996) The Professional Stranger: An Informal Introduction to Ethnography, , London: Academic Press; Bakhtin, M.M., (1981) The Dialogic Imagination, , Austin: University of Texas; Brody, H., (2001) The Other Side of Eden: Hunter-Gatherers, Farmers and the Shaping of the World, , London: Faber and Faber; De Chardin, P.T., (1967) Letters from a Traveller, , London: Collins (Fontana); Cheng, F., (1998) Le Dit De Tianyi, , Paris: Albin Michel; Cheng, F., (2002) Le Dialogue, , Paris: Desclée de Brouwer; Guillais, J., (1998) Les Champs De La colère, , Paris: Laffont; Guillais, J., (1999) La Ferme Des Orages, , Paris: Laffont; Hoffman, E., (1998) Lost in Translation, , London: Vintage (first published 1989 by Heinemann); Huston, N., (1999) Nord Perdu, , Paris: Actes sud; Iser, W., (1978) The Act of Reading: A Theory of Aesthetic Response, , London: Routledge and Kegan Paul; Jung, C.J., (1995) Memories,Dreams, Reflections (Recorded and Edited by a Jaffé Trans R.

Such a prevailing definition fails to recognise that just the ’Other’ is needed to properly define the ‘Self’. As a result, Western mainstream philosophy still seems to lack useful theoretical tools to approach that notion in an intercultural environment.

This paper brings these perspectives together in a critical reading of recent modern language and intercultural communication literatures. One approach views languages as powerful and complex goods, and identity formation as inherently unstable. It sees identity formation through languages largely in terms of human agency. To this view is counterposed an alternative argument in favour of languages as agents in themselves, as bearers of power and as imposers of scars. These alternative readings thus legitimise the dual idea of languages and linguists as agents that mark and are marked. Study abroad, accordingly, is not neutral but could lead to an identity formation of either kind (agentic or victim). In order for identity formation to be agentic in character, power has to be acknowledged, struggled with and claimed. Language learners, as intercultural agents, exercise their human properties and power in order to engage with unstable and destabilising sets of experiences. © 2002 by Taylor nad Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,,"Anderson, B., (1991) Imagined Communities: Reflections on the Origin and Spread of Nationalism, , London and New York: Verso; Archer, M., (1988) Culture and Agency, , Cambridge: Cambridge University Press; Archer, M., (1995) Realist Social Theory, , Cambridge: Cambridge University Press; Archer, M., (2000) Being Human: The Problem of Agency, , Cambridge: Cambridge University Press; Barnett, R., (1997) Higher Education: A Critical Business, , Buckingham: Open University Press; Bourdieu, P., (1984) Distinction: A Social Critique of the Judgement of Taste, , London: Routledge; Bourdieu, P., (2000) Pascalian Mediations, , Cambridge: Polity Press; Byram, M., (1997) Teaching and Assessing Intercultural Communicative Competence, , Clevedon: Multilingual Matters; Byram, M., Estarte-Sarries, V., Taylor, S., (1991) Cultural Studies and Language Learning: A Research Report, , Clevedon: Multilingual Matters; Byram, M., Fleming, M., (1998) Language Learning in Intercultural Perspective, , Cambridge: Cambridge University Press; Cohen, A., (1994) Self Consciousness: An Alternative Anthropology of Identity, , London and New York: Routledge; Coleman, J., (1998) Evolving Intercultural Perceptions among University Language Learners in Europe.

By focusing on three students from mainland China as part of a larger investigation of Asian students' classroom communication patterns in US universities, this paper explores in depth the complexities of silence, and the cultural interpretations of silence in various social contexts. Multiple functions of silence in terms of linkage, affecting, revelational, judgemental, and activating functions are explored across the three cases. This paper further investigates how Chinese students construct their identities through silence, and how they can reconstruct their identities by negotiating silence in American classrooms and by developing adaptive cultural transformation competence in the target culture. © 2003 Taylor & Francis Ltd.",,,,,,,,,,,"Barnlund, D.C., (1989) Communicative Styles of Japanese and Americans: Images and Realities, , Belmont, CA: Wadsworth Publishing Company; K.

With particular reference to Grossberg (1996), we critically review the ’figures’ associated with the concept of identity and argue that identity cannot be satisfactorily accounted for by separating ’intrinsic’ from ’extrinsic’ attributes. Instead, we follow an approach which accepts Kristéva’s Freudian analysis of the outsider phenomenon and sees identity as a continuous process of discursive construction involving voluntary acts of self-differentiation through language. In this, we follow Ricoeur’s (1990) distinction between ipse and idem and the associated notion of attestation according towhich language verifiesand ‘bearswitness’ to who we are.We illustrate the validity of Ricoeur’s approach by identifying a set of discursive features which occur in an extended student diary in which the author distances himself from his own statements and comments on his own responses to living in another cultural environment. Our analysis posits the existence of an ‘intercultural self’ whose identity is contained within the dynamic of one’s own language andwe drawconclusions from this analysis for the preparation of students for residence abroad. © 2001 by Taylor nad Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,,"Bernet, R., Kern, I., Marbach, E., (1993) An Introduction to Husserlian Phenomenology, , Evanston: Northwestern University Press; Bhabha, H., The Third Space (1990) Identity: Community, Culture, Difference, pp. 207-221. , J.

The emphasis is on qualitative writing as a heuristic process, on self-reflexivity in the text, and on self-transformation through writing. A selective discussion of some of the most salient contemporary debates is followed by a detailed exposition of student writing practices. Sub-sections of the article focus on seven issues which are seen as challenges to the writers of ethnographic texts: writing the self, ethnographic description, the question of evidence, drawing on concepts, using verbatim data, concluding and - of particular interest to teachers of language-and-culture - writing in the foreign language. © 2001 by Taylor nad Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,"1.

By incorporating the philosophies of Hans-Georg Gadamer, intercultural communication scholars will be able to bring a fresh perspective to guide their theory, research and practice. In particular, Gadamer’s notion of praxis is especially significant as it underscores the need to set a moral ground in all communication research, including intercultural communication.

This miscommunication has arisen from certain cultural and linguistic incompatibilities between the students and the teacher. Aboriginal students mainly speak Aboriginal English, which is different from Standard Australian English at all levels of linguistic structure and content. At the discourse level, Aboriginal English appears to be highly informed by schemas that are deeply rooted in Aboriginal cultures. This paper explores certain features of Aboriginal English discourse which appear to be associated with some distinctive roles played by schemas in processing and formation of discourse by Aboriginal children. For example, certain referential devices seem to retrieve their antecedents from the schema activated or the image evoked in the mind of the speaker, rather than the linguistic or physical context in which these devices are used. © 2001 by Taylor nad Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,,"(2000) Perth, Western Australia: Centre for Applied Language and Literacy Research, , Edith Cowan University; Arbib, M., Schema theory: Cooperative computation for brain theory and distributed AI (1994) Artificial Intelligence and Neural Networks: Steps Toward Principled Integration, , V.

In this paper, we argue that what is missing from this perspective is, crucially, power relations and the willpower to overcome them. Proceeding from this ethical and political stance, we suggest that research, education and training take on the role of institutional moral agents and turn their attention to critiquing power practices on the one hand and cultivating the ethical motivation to construct common goals on the other. As empirical illustrations of research, we examine, firstly, how intercultural '(mis)understandings' are utilised to suit political and economic interests and, secondly, what members themselves feel to be the cause of failures in intercultural communication. In conclusion, we discuss some implications for pedagogy. © 2001 by Taylor nad Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,,"Austin, J.L., (1962) How to Do Things with Words, , Oxford: The Clarendon Press; Billig, M., (1987) Arguing and Thinking: A Rhetorical Approach to Social Psychology, , Cambridge: Cambridge University Press; Blommaert, J., Verschueren, J., (1991) The Pragmatics of Intercultural and International Communication, , Amsterdam: John Benjamins; Blommaert, J., Verschueren, J., (1998) Debating Diversity: Analysing the Discourse of Tolerance, , London: Routledge; Blum-Kulka, S., House, J., Kasper, G., (1989) Cross-Cultural Pragmatics: Requests and Apologies, , Norwood, NJ: Ablex Publishing Corporation; Bourdieu, P., (1991) Language and Symbolic Power, , Cambridge: Polity Press; Carbaugh, D., (1990) Cultural Communication and Intercultural Contact, , Hillsdale, NJ: L.
