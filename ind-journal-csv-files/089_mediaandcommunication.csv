As such, while uncertainty might be communicated in news articles about climate science, climate skeptics have also exploited this uncertainty to cast doubt on science itself. We performed two studies to assess whether scientific uncertainty affects laypeople’s assessments of issue uncertainty, the credibility of the information, their trust in scientists and climate science, and impacts their decision-making. In addition, we addressed how these effects are influenced by further information on relevant scientific processes, because knowing that uncertainty goes along with scientific research could ease laypeople’s interpretations of uncertainty around evidence and may even protect against negative impacts of such uncertainty on trust. Unexpectedly, in study 1, after participants read both a text about research methods and a news article that included scientific uncertainty, they had lower trust in the scientists’ assertions than when they read the uncertain news article alone (but this did not impact trust in climate science or decision-making). In study 2, we tested whether these results occurred due to participants overestimating the scientific uncertainty at hand. Hence, we varied the framing of uncertainty in the text on scientific processes. We found that exaggerating the scientific uncertainty produced by scientific processes (vs. framing the uncertainty as something to be expected) did not negatively affect participants’ trust ratings. However, the degree to which participants preferred effortful reasoning on problems (intellective epistemic style) correlated with ratings of trust in scientists and climate science and with their decision-making. In sum, there was only little evidence that the introduction of uncertainty in news articles would affect participants’ ratings of trust and their decision-making, but their preferred style of reasoning did. © 2020 by the authors.","Fake news; Procedural knowledge; Readership; Science communication; Scientific literacy; Scientific uncertainty; Trust",,,,,,,,,,"Anderson, A.

These skills can be put into practice to combat the infodemic by amplifying quality information and actively correcting misinformation seen on social media.

Although such concerns often relate to the total sum of information flows generated online by many groups of stakeholders, vaccination controversies tend to vary across time, place, and the vaccine at issue. We studied content generated by administrators on three Facebook pages in Denmark established to promote critical debate about Human Papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination. We developed a qualitative coding frame allowing us to analyze administrators’ posts in terms of prevalent topics and intertextual material incorporated by linking and sharing. We coded more than a third of the posts (n =699) occurring in the period from November 2012, when the first page was founded, to May 2019. We found that the pages mainly addressed the reports of adverse events following HPV vaccination and the (perceived) inadequate response of healthcare systems. To construct their central message, the pages assembled different sources, mostly reporting from Danish news media, but also personal narratives, scientific information, political assertions, and more. We conclude that HPV vaccination assemblages such as these pages are heterogeneous and contextual. They are not uniform sites of vaccine criticism, but rather seem to respond to and exchange information and misinformation within the communication environment in which they are embedded. © 2020 by the authors.","Controversy; Denmark; Facebook; Human papillomavirus; Misinformation; Qualitative content analysis; Social media; Vaccination",,,,,,"Novo Nordisk Fonden, NNF","We are grateful to the three anonymous reviewers, the thematic issue guest editors, and the journal editors for useful comments.

However, in this arena, science coexists with non-scientific or pseudoscientific beliefs that can influence people’s knowledge, attitudes, and behavior. Our research sets out to find empirical evidence of the representation of pro-science, anti-science and neutral stances in online videos. From a search on Google videos, we conducted content analysis of a sample of videos about climate change, vaccines and nanotechnology (n =826). Results indicate that a search through Google videos provides a relatively small representation of videos with an anti-science stance, which can be regarded as positive, given the high potential influence of this search engine in spreading scientific information among the public. Our research also provides empirical evidence of the fact that an anti-science stance is more frequent in user-generated content than in videos disseminated by other types of producers. © 2020 by the authors.","Climate change; Google; Nanotechnology; Science communication; User-generated content; Vaccines; Video production",,,,,,"COS 2013–45301-P","This work was funded by the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness (COS 2013–45301-P).

We describe how systems for automated journalism could be biased in terms of both the information content and the lexical choices in the text, and what mechanisms allow human biases to affect automated journalism even if the data the system operates on is considered neutral. Hence, we sketch out three distinct scenarios differentiated by the technical transparency of the systems and the level of cooperation of the system operator, affecting the choice of methods for investigating bias. We identify methods for diagnostics in each of the scenarios and note that one of the scenarios is largely identical to investigating bias in non-automatically produced texts. As a solution to this last scenario, we suggest the construction of a simple news generation system, which could enable a type of analysis-by-proxy. Instead of analyzing the system, to which the access is limited, one would generate an approximation of the system which can be accessed and analyzed freely. If successful, this method could also be applied to analysis of human-written texts. This would make automated journalism not only a target of bias diagnostics, but also a diagnostic device for identifying bias in human-written news. © 2020 by the authors; licensee Cogitatio (Lisbon, Portugal).","Algorithmic journalism; Automated journalism; Bias; Diagnosis; Journalism; News automation",,,,,,"825153","This article is supported by the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation program under grant agreement No 825153, project EMBEDDIA (Cross-Lingual Embeddings for Less-Represented Languages in European News Media).

As news organizations relinquish control over distribution, they may feel the need to optimize their content to align with platform logics to ensure economic sustainability. However, the opaque and often proprietary nature of platform algorithms makes it hard for news organizations to truly know what kinds of content are preferred and will perform well. Invoking the concept of algorithmic ‘folk theories,’ this article presents a study of in-depth, semi-structured interviews with 18 U.S.-based news journalists and editors to understand how they make sense of social media algorithms, and to what extent this influences editorial decision making. Our findings suggest that while journalists’ understandings of platform algorithms create new considerations for gatekeeping practices, the extent to which it influences those practices is often negotiated against traditional journalistic conceptions of newsworthiness and journalistic autonomy. © 2020 by the authors; licensee Cogitatio (Lisbon, Portugal).",,,,,,,"National Science Foundation, NSF: IIS-1717330","The authors would like to thank our participants for providing invaluable insight, without which this project would not have been possible.

This article considers how Russian state officials and Russian digital rights advocates construct the notion of privacy in their public online discourses. I argue that how these actors talk about privacy helps shape the norms and the politics around it in Russia. An in-depth analysis of activity reports published online by the state internet regulator and a grassroots digital rights group reveals competing privacy discourses underpinned by differential understandings of how anonymity, secrecy, confidentiality, and control of personal data determine the distribution of power and agency in Russian public and political life. These differential interpretations of privacy inform the contentious politics that emerge around how privacy is regulated and negotiated within the greater regulatory and normative framework of digital citizenship in Russia. Thus, the article offers critical insights into the contestation of citizenship and, consequently, the distribution of power in more and less democratic systems. © 2020 by the author.","Data; Digital rights; Power; Privacy; Russia",,,,,,,"This article was made possible with support from the 2019–2020 Journal Publication Scheme of the Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences, Dublin City University.",,,"Anthony, L., (2019) AntConc (Version 3.5.8) [Computer software], , https://www.laurenceanthony.net/software, Tokyo: Waseda University.

In this essay, we synthesize the articles in this thematic issue, which offer empirical evidence for how algorithms—and especially those designed to automate news production—are being incorporated not only into journalistic activities but also into the logics of journalism itself. They underscore that journalists have neither feared nor rejected such algorithms, as might be expected given the recent history of technological adoption in journalism. Instead, journalists have sought to normalize the technology by negotiating them against existing values and practices, and perhaps even reified some normative ideological constructs by finding unique value in what they offer as humans. These articles also highlight the shortcomings of those algorithms, giving pause to postulations of algorithms as potential solutions to shortcomings of trust in news and market failures. Indeed, such algorithms may end up amplifying the very biases that seed distrust in news all the while appearing less valuable to readers than their human counterparts. We also point to new opportunities for research, including examinations of how algorithms shape other stages in the journalistic workflow, such as interviewing sources, organizing knowledge, and verifying claims. We further point to the need to investigate higher analytic levels and incorporate additional perspectives, both from more diverse contexts (e.g., Global South) and from our sister academic fields (e.g., human–computer interac-tion). We conclude with optimism about the continued contributions this stream of work is poised to make in the years to come. © 2020 by the authors;.","Actants; Algorithmic journalism; Algorithms; Automated journalism; Automation; Journalism; Journalism studies; Robot journalism",,,,,,,,,,"Chyi, H.

In the analysis, we draw on theoretical approaches that understand privacy as having four dimensions: relational, participatory, contextual, and technological. Moreover, we seek whether a specific norm of data-related privacy could be defined/redefined within the discourse. Considering the postcommunist past that shapes a specific approach to surveillance and the general polarisation of polish media discourse, one would expect the key role of privacy issues in the public sphere. Thus, applying a critical discourse studies analysis, the aim was to capture the character of the so far under-researched privacy in Polish media discourse. We study what types of institutional agents are mentioned as creating privacy policies and what dimensions of privacy they tackle. Moreover, we also try to capture whether the institutional position offers a specific normative understanding of privacy and whether this norm is citizen/user-oriented. The results of the study indicate that: both the media discourse and the normative content of privacy policies are dominated by legal aspects concerned with the issues resulting from EU regulations (i.e., General Data Protection Regulation); privacy policies are institutionally dispersed and monopolised by journalists and experts instead of state officials or politicians; and there is only limited evidence of a discursive frame of a citizen-oriented norm of how to protect data-related privacy. © 2020 by the authors.","Critical discourse studies; General data protection regulation; Media discourse; Poland; Privacy; Privacy-invasive politics",,,,,,,"The authors would like to express the gratitude the Department of Communication, Media and Journalism at Nicolaus Copernicus University in Toruń for the financial support and the student assistants for their research input on the initial stages of the project.",,,"(2018) wPolityce, , https://wgospodarce.pl/informacje/56819-absurdyrodo-wynikaja-z-nieznajomosci-prawa, Absurdy RODO wynikają z nieznajomości prawa [GDPR absurdities arise from ignorance of the law], (November 25).

As some of these relations change due to technological innovations, new hybrid contexts—technologies that are interwoven with newsroom values, routines, and socio-cultural experiences—can emerge. One key question is how journalists conceptualise and interact with such technologies, and to what degree they retain (creative) agency in the process. Therefore, this study evaluates the intersection of automated journalism and journalistic role conceptions. Using Hanitzsch’s and Vos’s circular model of journalistic roles (2017) and Deuze’s understanding of journalism as an ideology (2005) as a theoretical framework, this study examines some of the discursive aspects of automated journalism by asking: To what extent are journalistic roles (a) challenged or (b) advanced as a result of automated journal-ism? Our findings more closely align with the latter, pointing to a strong sense of discursive maintenance of journalists’ roles and their core skillset and thus suggesting a high degree of ideological continuity in the face of industrial disruption. It concludes with an agenda for future research and stresses that at times when journalism and automation intersect, the field would benefit from incorporating emerging conceptual frameworks such as human–machine communication. © 2020 by the authors; licensee Cogitatio (Lisbon, Portugal).","Algorithmic journalism; Automated journalism; Computational journalism; Journalism; News; Newsroom; Technology",,,,,,"Australian Research Council, ARC: DP160101211

A multi-level perspective is used to determine which strategies data providers, software providers, and media outlets use to develop automated reporting, which compiles perspectives across the entire line of news production. The results of 11 in-depth interviews show that non-journalistic actors are vital partners in the news production process, as all actors work together in data handling, training, and software development. Moreover, automation can generate additional content such as match and historical coverage to help address shortfalls in capacity. However, given the business case for automation, amateur football (soccer) is currently the only viable candidate for its use. Many actors involved in the process argue that automated content is an added value for their readers, but claim that content quality has to be put before quantity. This means that some media outlets edit automated articles to increase the quality of their sports journalism, but that this is done only on a small scale. Media outlets do not perceive their roles to be changing, but see automation as a helpful tool that complements their work; a few use automatically created articles as a baseline for in-depth report-ing. Moreover, the so-called ‘meta-writer’ has not become a reality yet, as data-processing and news writing are still kept separate. This article sheds new light on the use of automation in the sports beat, highlighting the growing role of non-journalistic actors in the news production process. © 2020 by the author;.","Algorithmic journalism; Automated journalism; Automated news; Data journalism; Football; Germany; Meta-journalist; Robo-news; Soccer; Sports journalism",,,,,,,,,,"Ahva, L., About actor positioning in journalism… slowly (2019) Media and Communication, 7 (4), pp. 123-126; Alhalaseh, R., Munezero, M., Leinonen, M., Leppänen, L., Avikainen, J., Toivonen, H., Towards datadriven generation of visualizations for automatically generated news articles (2015) Proceedings of the 22nd international academic Mindtrek conference, pp. 100-109. , M.

This begs for advancing research on the flow of individual and organizational information considering its relational, contextual and, in consequence, political dimensions. Privacy, understood as the control over the flow of individual or group information in relation to communicative actions of others, frames the articles assembled in this thematic issue. These contributions focus on theoretical challenges of contemporary communication and media privacy research as well as on structural privacy conditions and people’s mundane communicative practices underlining inherent political aspect. They highlight how particular acts of doing privacy are grounded in citizen agency realized in datafied environments. Overall, this collection of articles unfolds the concept of ‘Politics of Privacy’ in diverse ways, contributing to an emerging body of communication and media research. © 2020 by the authors; licensee Cogitatio (Lisbon, Portugal).","Agency; Datafication; Datasecurity; Media practices; Politics; Privacy",,,,,,"Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek, NWO

Strikingly, however, most people tend not to read privacy policies because they are long and cumbersome, indicating that people do not wish to expend much (cognitive) effort on reading such policies. The present study aimed to examine whether shorter privacy policies can be beneficial in informing users about a social networking site’s (SNS) privacy practices, and to investigate associations between variables relevant for privacy decision-making using one theory-based integrative model. In an online experiment, participants (N = 305) were asked to create a personal account on an SNS after being given the option to read the privacy policy. Privacy policy length and the SNS’s level of privacy were varied, creating a 2 (policy length) × 2 (level of privacy) between-subjects design. The results revealed that participants who saw short policies spent less time on reading but gained higher knowledge about the SNS’s privacy practices—due to the fact that they spent more reading time per word. Factual privacy policy knowledge was found to be an indicator for participants’ subjective privacy perception. The perception and evaluation of the specific SNS´s privacy level influenced the assessment of privacy costs and benefits. Particularly when benefits were perceived as high, self-disclosure was increased. © 2020 by the authors; licensee Cogitatio (Lisbon, Portugal).","Online privacy; Privacy calculus; Privacy policy; Self-disclosure; Social networking site",,,,,,"Bundesministerium fÃ¼r Gesundheit, BMG: 16KIS0743

Experimental comparisons further suggest that participants provided higher ratings for credibility, quality, and readability simply when they were told that they were reading a human-written article.

This activism was initiated and led by Swedish teenager, Greta Thunberg. Like other contemporary movements, the School Strike 4 Climate used social media. For this article, we use Twitter trace data to examine the global dynamics of the student strike on March 15, 2019. We offer a nuanced analysis of 993 tweets, employing a combination of qualitative and quantitative analysis. Like other movements, the primary function of these tweets was to share information, but we highlight a unique type of information shared in these tweets—documentation of local events across the globe. We also examine opinions shared about youth, the tactic (protest/strike), and climate change, as well as the assignment of blame on government and other institutions for their inaction and compliance in the climate crisis. This global climate strike reflects a trend in international protest events, which are connected through social media and other digital media tools. More broadly, it allows us to rethink how social media platforms are transforming political engagement by offering actors—especially the younger generation—agency through the ability to voice their concerns to a global audience. © 2020 by the authors; licensee Cogitatio (Lisbon, Portugal).","Climate change; Environment; March; Protest; Socialmedia; Strike; Twitter; Youth",,,,,,,,,,"Arbuckle, M.

A pronounced understanding of the politics of privacy is however lacking. In this contribution, we set out to push this forward by mapping four communication and media perspectives on the political implications of privacy. In order to do so, we recur on Barry’s (2002) distinction of the political and the politics and outline linkages between individual and structural dimensions of privacy. Finally, we argue that the media practice perspective is well suited to offer an analytical tool for the study of the multiple aspects of privacy in a political context. © 2020 by the authors; licensee Cogitatio (Lisbon, Portugal).","Media research; Politics; Privacy; Technology",,,,,,,,,,"Acquisti, A., Taylor, C.

Journalism programs do not merely produce commodities; they help students constitute a public within a school community. When publishing online, student journalists navigate relationships behind the scenes with stakeholders, including peers, adults, and the institution. Publishing can be fraught with hesitation and fear of consequences for speaking out. Because of this implica-tion, journalism programs can serve as “potentially valuable yet imperfect” settings for the amplification of student voice and civic development, but can also unduly limit students’ self-expression, especially for girls (Bobkowski & Belmas, 2017). What might be the affordances and constraints of digital participation in a high school journalism program? How might youth journalists and other participants navigate exigencies of publishing online in this context? We, the head editors and adviser, use grounded theory to examine processes and develop pragmatic knowledge (Glaser & Strauss, 2017). Through a mix of prompts, group interviews, and participant observation, we develop a case study that demonstrates implications for ‘risk context,’ or the total situation of an actor’s vulnerability brought on by digital participation in publishing online. We describe what digital participation is good for, and for whom, thus further theorizing relationships between agency and co-production. © 2020 by the authors; licensee Cogitatio (Lisbon, Portugal).","Digital participation; Digital writing; High school; Journalism; Journalistic collaboration; Risk",,,,,,,,,,"(2018) Troll patrol findings, , https://decoders.amnesty.org/projects/troll-patrol/findings#introduction, Amnesty International.

Mercury has been identified by conspiracy theorists as one of the most harmful components of vaccines, and Gandhi, who has condemned vaccination practices, has been celebrated as a significant source of authority. Quotes attributed to Gandhi against vaccination, complete with picture and embellished font, circulate across various popular platforms, as do intimidating images of syringes dipped in poison coupled with a list of seemingly occult or dangerous ingredients. This article analyses both memes, moving from the im-ageboard 4chan to the search engine Google Images, and illustrates how the repurposed, often ironic use of visual tropes can either undermine or strengthen the claims that accompany them. The aim is to explore the intersections of conspiracy theory, visual rhetoric, and digital communication in order to elucidate the ambiguity of memes as vehicles for the spread of controversial health-related information. © 2020 by the author; licensee Cogitatio (Lisbon, Portugal).","Conspiracy theories; Memes; Misinformation; Vaccination",,,,,,,,,,"(2020) Statistics, , https://archive.4plebs.org/pol/statistics, 4plebs. 4plebs.

These devices will collect vast amounts of data which needs to be processed in real-time, overwhelming centralized cloud architectures. To address this need, the industry seeks to process data closer to the source, driving a major shift from the cloud to the ‘edge.’ This article critically investigates the privacy implications of edge computing. It outlines the abilities introduced by the edge by drawing on two recently published scenarios, an automated license plate reader and an ethnic facial detection model. Based on these affordances, three key questions arise: what kind of data will be collected, how will this data be processed at the edge, and how will this data be ‘completed’ in the cloud? As a site of intermediation between user and cloud, the edge allows data to be extracted from individuals, acted on in real-time, and then abstracted or sterilized, removing identifying information before being stored in conventional data centers. The article thus argues that edge affordances establish a fundamental new ‘privacy condition’ while sidestepping the safeguards associated with the ‘privacy proper’ of personal data use. Responding effectively to these challenges will mean rethinking person-based approaches to privacy at both regulatory and citizen-led levels. © 2020 by the author.","Artificial intelligence; Cloud; Edge computing; Personal data; Privacy; Smart city; Surveillance",,,,,,"Australian Research Council, ARC: DP160103307","This research work was supported as part of the wider project ‘Data Centres and the Governance of Labour and Territory,’ an Australian Research Council Discovery Project (DP160103307).",,,"Alrawais, A., Alhothaily, A., Hu, C., Cheng, X., Fog computing for the Internet of Things: Security and privacy issues (2017) IEEE Internet Computing, 31 (2), pp. 34-42; Ananthanarayanan, G., Bahl, P., Bodík, P., Chintalapudi, K., Philipose, M., Ravindranath, L., Sinha, S., Real-time video analytics: The killer app for edge computing (2017) Computer, 50 (10), pp. 58-67; Bailas, C., Marsden, M., Zhang, D., O’Connor, N.

At the core of this discourse is a moral coupling wherein surveillance is perceived as enemy and privacy as friend. Even if this binary approach renders arguments for democratising data more persuasive, a political cost accompanies it. As this discourse situates political struggle at the level of digital infrastructure and political structures, the moral coupling largely overlooks the ambiguities of how people in their various activities in a digital environment experience surveillance and privacy. Such a framing may discourage users at large from engagement with politics of privacy. Edward Snowden’s autobiography is taken as a prominent example of the prevailing discourse. While analysing Snowden’s descriptions of privacy and surveillance critically, the author points out the specific value of life stories in describing what privacy means and why it matters. While we cannot assume all people to be equally capable of considering how their own life intersects with the history of their society, we can presume that varying life stories should contribute to the public knowledge of privacy. To provide the framework necessary for appropriately contextualising empirical evidence, the author presents a model wherein privacy is composed of five dimensions: solitude, anonymity, secrecy, intimacy, and dignity. © 2020 by the author;.","Digital infrastructure; Life-story research; Online security; Privacy; Snowden; Surveillance",,,,,,"Academy of Finland","This article is based on research conducted in the Banal Surveillance research project (2018–2022), funded by the Academy of Finland.

Holding that privacy is constructed through the interrelated information practices of both individuals and their mediated surroundings, it addresses radio as a previously intimate and privacy friendly medium. The case of the Royal Prank call by the Australian 2DayFM radio station demonstrates how contemporary converged radio practices affect the privacies of unintended participants in their shows. In December 2012, Jacintha Saldanha, nurse of London’s Royal King Edward VII Hospital committed suicide after two Australian radio presenters had made a prank phone call pretending to be Queen Elizabeth and Prince Charles concerned about the state of Duchess Kate’s health, who was expecting her first child. The case identifies three conditions, each with implications on privacy. First, digitization renders radio content archivable and repeatable. There is a second life of radio programs keeping available information about any people involved. Secondly, the division of radio related labour leads to a lack of journalistic responsibility for respecting privacy standards. Broadcasters feel no need to be sensitive regarding the consequences of disseminated material, as commercial and legal staff decide on that. Finally, legal frameworks continue to apply legacy radio privacy measures and do not correspond to these new working conditions, as the reactions of the Australian supervisory authority show. In consequence, the case of the Royal Prank call demonstrates the impossibility to fight individual privacy when one is unintentionally involved in radio shows. © 2020 by the author.","Commercial radio; Convergence; Media supervision; Privacy; Radio show; Radio station; Royal Prank",,,,,,,,,,"Ala-Fossi, M., Why did TV bits and radio bits not fit together?

Accordingly, privacy is often regarded as a form of freedom from social, economic, and institutional influences. Such a negative perspective on privacy, however, focuses too much on how individuals can be protected or can protect themselves, instead of challenging the necessity of protection itself. In this article, I argue that increasing online privacy literacy not only empowers individuals to achieve (a necessarily limited) form of negative privacy, but has the potential to facilitate a privacy deliberation process in which individuals become agents of social change that could lead to conditions of positive privacy and informational self-determination. To this end, I propose a four-dimensional model of online privacy literacy that encompasses factual privacy knowledge, privacy-related reflection abilities, privacy and data protection skills, and critical privacy literacy. I then outline how this combination of knowledge, abilities, and skills 1) enables to individuals to protect themselves against some horizontal and vertical privacy intrusions and 2) motivates individuals to critically challenge the social structures and power relations that necessitate the need for protection in the first place. Understanding these processes, as well as critically engaging with the normative premises and implications of the predominant negative concepts of privacy, offers a more nuanced direction for future research on online privacy literacy and privacy in general. © 2020 by the authortion.","Data protection; Digital literacy; Information society; Informational self-determination; New media; Online privacy",,,,,,,,,,"Acquisti, A., Brandimarte, L., Loewenstein, G., Privacy and human behavior in the age of information (2015) Science, 347 (6221), pp. 509-514. , https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aaa1465; Altman, I., (1975) The environment and social behav-ior: Privacy) personal space) territory) crowding, , Monterey, CA: Brooks/Cole Publishing; Alvermann, D.

We borrow tools from network science to bring evidence that suggest legacy news media retain control of the most central positions in the online news domain. Great progress has been made in discussing theoretically the impact of the Internet on the news media ecology. Less research attention, however, has been given to empirically testing changes in the role of legacy media and the rising prominence of digital-born outlets. To fill this gap, in this study we use the hyperlink-induced topic search algorithm, which identifies authorities by means of a hyperlink network, to show that legacy media are still the most authoritative sources in the media ecology. To further substantiate their dominant role, we also examine the structural position of news providers in the audience network. We gather navigation data from a panel of 30,000 people and use it to reproduce the network of patterns of news consumption. While legacy news media retain control of the brokerage positions for the general population, our analysis-focused on patterns of young news consumers-reveals that new digital outlets also occupy relevant positions to control the audience flow. The results of this study have substantive implications for our understanding of news organizations’ roles and how they attain authority in the digital age. © 2020 by the author; licensee Cogitatio (Lisbon, Portugal).","Digital audience; Digital-born media; Hyperlinks; Legacy media; Network analysis; News; Online news",,,,,,"CSO2013–47082-P","The research reported in this article was partly funded by the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness under grant CSO2013–47082-P.

Scholars denote external actors with these types of knowledge as interlopers or actors at the periphery of journalism. In this study, we follow two Swedish digital native data journalism start-ups operating in the Nordics from when they were founded in 2012 to 2019. Although the start-ups have been successful in news journalism over the years and acted as drivers for change in Nordic news innovation, they also have a presence in sectors other than journalism. This qualitative case study, which is based on interviews over time with the start-up founders and a qualitative analysis of blog posts written by the employees at the two start-ups, tells a story of journalists working at the periphery of legacy media, at least temporarily forced to leave journalism behind yet successfully using journalistic thinking outside of journalistic contexts. © 2020 by the author; licensee Cogitatio (Lisbon, Portugal).","Boundary work; Data journalism; Digital native; Finland; Journalism; Peripheral actors; Sweden",,,,,,"Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020: 825153

VINNOVA","When the Google-funded Digital News Initiative (DNI) started in 2015, Finnäs and Magnusson decided to apply for funding. They received funding for an idea of news automation based on data sets from Statistics Sweden, a government agency that produces and publishes official statistics. In interviews, Finnäs describes this moment as a defining and critical success factor for the company, and the idea developed into the start-up news service Newsworthy. Overall, Google has been a crucial supporter of data journalism and media innovation (Fanta, 2018; Lindén, 2020). In 2016, Magnusson and Finnäs were involved in an incubator program managed by the Swedish innovation agency Vinnova. This project was plagued by communication problems and what was perceived as less-than-helpful advice: “Don’t get me started on that,” Magnusson said afterwards (personal communication, November 8, 2019). The main problem was that the funding from this program could not be used to develop their current business model; rather, it could only be used to develop some kind of tangible product. Finnäs and Magnusson struggled to find a solution that Vinnova was willing to fund, and they were asked to “think outside the box” and “be brave.” Ultimately, they received no funding.","The authors wish to thank Megan Owens for proof reading and the anonymous reviewers for valuable comments.

However, news sites require commenters to remain civil in their interactions, which led users to seek alternative ways of commenting on the news. This article explores in-depth the contents of a sample of 98,426 user-comments collected between February-March 2019 from three major Spanish digital native newspapers: ElDiario.es, ElEspañol.com, and ElConfidencial.com. The main goals were to analyze whether comments in news outlets are deliberative, to assess the quality of the debate that takes place in them, and to describe their specific features. Discourse ethics were explored to determine the discussions’ impact, the language used, the acceptance of arguments, and the recognition and civility of participants. Findings reveal that comments sections in news outlets do not have a dialogic nature and that the debates have a low-quality profile. Nonetheless, the degree of mutual respect in interaction is acceptable, with slightly observed levels of incivility. Finally, the data suggest that the focused comments are higher on social media and that memes and emojis represent a new form of digital discourse. © 2020 by the author; licensee Cogitatio (Lisbon, Portugal).","Discourse ethics; Native digital media; New media; Newspapers; Social media; User-generated content",,,,,,"Eusko Jaurlaritza

For years, though, news media has not invested much effort into nurturing rich connections with their consumers and, consequently, neglected the promotion of a participatory culture that could bring benefits for all involved (Neuberger & Nuernbergk, 2010; Rosen, 2006). Vanishing advertising revenue and changing habits of news consumption on the Internet create a situation for changing that situation-especially when considering journalism as a service (Jarvis, 2014). Therefore, this article employs multiple case-study research to analyze and compare how four digital news natives from different countries (The Correspondent from the Netherlands, eldiario.es from Spain, Mediapart from France, and the Brazilian branch of The Intercept) are creating more meaningful connections with their audiences in order to sustain their businesses. We found out that all cases resort in varying degrees to the ideology of journalism, personification, transparency, impactful content, and community as motivations to attract members, while at the same time refraining from advertising becomes a guarantee of independence. Social media is losing ground, as companies use their own platforms and channels, such as emails, to develop routines that take member participation into account in different levels-from intermediate to maximal-though customization is still limited. The challenge for online-born news companies is to manage so many variables while taking into consideration feedback from their sustainable base of members. © 2020 by the author; licensee Cogitatio (Lisbon, Portugal).","Business models; Customer relationships; Digital journalism; Entrepreneurial journalism; Innovation; News media; Revenue sources",,,,,,"H2020 Marie SkÅodowska-Curie Actions, MSCA: 765140

Many have specifically looked to digital native news organizations to understand the ways that journalism is attempting to reinvent itself for a media landscape that is very different from the previous one. Yet what often gets lost in this focus on the newest news organizations is the resilience of many of journalism’s older ones. In this study, I analyze a year’s worth of U.S.-based online news consumption data to show that, even in a media environment increasingly saturated with digital native news outlets, legacy news brands continue to comprise a majority of the most popular news sites. Drawing on audience studies literature, I argue that these findings likely reflect audience preferences for familiar, established brands, as well as structural advantages these brands maintain due to their size and capital. I conclude that the fate of digital news organizations is not just a question of their innovativeness or nimbleness. It is also a question of their ability to combat a combination of powerful, stubborn forces: the habits of the people they hope to reach, and the deep pockets of their competitors. © 2020 by the author; licensee Cogitatio (Lisbon, Portugal).","Audience studies; Digital native news; Journalism; Legacy news; News consumption; News publishers",,,,,,,"The author wishes to thank the reviewers for their thoughtful, thorough, and constructive feedback.",,,"Abernathy, P.M., (2016) The rise of a new media baron and the emerging threat of news deserts, , Chapel Hill, NC: Center for Innovation and Sustainability in Local Media; Allcott, H., Gentzkow, M., Social media and fake news in the 2016 election (2017) Journal of Economic Perspectives, 31 (2), pp. 211-236. , https://doi.org/10.1257/jep.31.2.211; Amazeen, M.A., Wojdynski, B.W., The effects of disclosure format on native advertising recognition and audience perceptions of legacy and online news publishers (2018) Journalism, , https://doi.org/10.1177/1464884918754829, Advance online publication; Arrese, A., Kaufmann, J., Legacy and native news brands online: Do they show different news consumption patterns?

The development of this new media model coincides in time with an increase in dependence on social networks. Online media editors estimate that one third of their visits proceed from Facebook, a figure that obliges them to create specific strategies to ensure their company’s reputation and growth in the 2.0 field. The aim of this article is to assess what motivates Spanish digitalnative newspapers to act on social networks, analyse their internal view of these channels, and describe their strategies for managing their relationship with audiences. Based on a qualitative and longitudinal approach, we conducted in-depth interviews with the social media editors of the most relevant digital-native newspapers in Spain-El Confidencial, Eldiario.es, El Español and El HuffPost-during 2017 and 2019, in order to trace the evolution of their professional routines. These social media editors consider that although digital-native newsrooms are smaller than traditional ones, they are more agile in reacting to metrics. Our results also confirm that Instagram is generating great expectations, and the new paywall system is affecting the way audiences are understood. © 2020 by the author; licensee Cogitatio (Lisbon, Portugal).","Audience; Media business; New media; Newspaper; Online-native newsroom; Social media; Social networks",,,,,,"Universidad de MÃ¡laga, UMA","This work was supported by the project ‘News, Networks and User in the Hybrid Media System: Disinformation, Transparency and Cybersecurity in Journalism Practice,’ and the Department of Journalism at the University of Malaga.",,,"Adair, B., Stencel, M., Clabby, C., Li, C., (2019) The human touch in automated fact-cheking, , Paper presented at the Computation + Journalism Symposium, Miami, FL; Arrese, A., Kaufmann, J., Legacy and native news brands online: Do they show different news consumption patters?

In this context, values and goals may remain diverse, arguably linked to idiosyncratic elements which often open a gap between traditional and more contemporary newsroom models. Following a qualitative approach, this study examines online media accountability instruments from a functional perspective, dividing its influence in three temporal phases of news production (Heikkilä et al., 2012). In this way, instruments that hold journalists responsible for their work are explored in four leading online news media from Spain: two digital native outlets (Eldiario.es and ElConfidencial.com) and two legacy outlets (ElPais.com and ElMundo.es). In addition to this observation, in-depth interviews are conducted with staff members in charge of audience management to explore the inner routines and protocols that determine the efficacy of such aspirations. Our work reveals the preponderant role of instruments focused on the actor and production transparency that the studied media implement to fulfill their responsibility, especially when compared with the weakened self-regulation instruments. The answers of the interviewees stress the difficulties they face in managing participatory forms of accountability and disclose tensions between different strategies, as well as other structural factors that are discussed as essential for the consolidation of these deontological initiatives. © 2020 by the author; licensee Cogitatio (Lisbon, Portugal).","Citizen participation; Deontology; Digital journalism; Journalism ethics; Journalistic culture; Media accountability; Self-regulation; Transparency",,,,,,,,,,"Alsius, S., Mauri-Ríos, M., Rodríguez-Martínez, R., Spain: A diverse and asymmetric landscape (2011) Mapping media accountability in Europe and beyond, pp. 155-167. , In T.

These new media are different from legacy brands in terms of business models, distribution strategies, corporate organisation, and editorial priorities. It would be expected that the different nature of both legacy and digital-born news media has driven to two types of significantly different audiences. This article aims to analyse whether there are significant differences between the users of these two types of media, by comparing the online audiences of five European countries’ (United Kingdom, Germany, France, Spain, and Italy) legacy and digital-born media brands in 2015 and 2019. The article will focus on four aspects: demographic and socioeconomics profiles (sex, age, income and level of education); interest in news; payment for online news; and media trust. © 2020 by the author; licensee Cogitatio (Lisbon, Portugal).","Digital-born media; Legacy brands; Media brands; Media trust; Paywalls",,,,,,"Ministerio de Ciencia, InnovaciÃ³n y Universidades, MCIU","This work was supported by the Spanish Ministry of Science, Innovation and Universities (Research Project DIGINATIVEMEDIA, Reference No. RTI2018–093346-BC31).",,,"Abel, J.D., Wirth, M.O., Newspaper vs. TV credibility for local news (1977) Journalism Quarterly, 54 (2), pp. 371-375. , https://doi.org/10.1177/107769907705400223; Althaus, S.L., Tewksbury, D., Patterns of internet and traditional news media use in a networked community (2000) Political Communication, 17 (1), pp. 21-45; Ardèvol-Abreu, A., Hooker, C.M., Gil de Zúñiga, H., Online news creation, trust in the media, and political participation: Direct and moderating effects over time (2018) Journalism, 19 (5), pp. 611-631. , https://doi.org/10.1177/1464884917700447; Arrese, A., From gratis to paywalls (2016) Journalism Studies, 17 (8), pp. 1051-1067. , https://doi.org/10.1080/1461670X.2015.1027788; Arrese, A., Kaufmann, J., Legacy and native news brands online: Do they show different news consumption patterns?

The accelerated technological evolution linked to the changing information consumption habits of the users demanded a constant reinvention capability. Furthermore, the need for profit and the drop in advertisement sales have pushed the media to redefine their structure, content and social media presence. The Ibero-American scene has experienced a sprout of a mixture of digital native news media. They are journalistic projects, conceived from and on the Internet, which have reached considerable renown and becoming reference media on the information level. Internet prompted a reduction of the costs related to the creation of media outlets. However, the establishment of a sustainable business model is one of the main challenges. The research presented looks at the business models of Ibero-American digital native news media based on a comparative analysis of 14 case studies, alongside interviews with their founders. The findings include, among other things, a tendency for business models based on diverse and hyper-specialized content targeted at micro-audiences. This research found an interest in horizontality, participation and user engagement, and noticed the need for these media to diversify their income sources. © 2020 by the author; licensee Cogitatio (Lisbon, Portugal).","Business model; Digital native; Journalism; Native digital media; News media",,,,,,,,,,"Adira, A.U., Juez, A.P., Díaz, A.F., Bocio, A.I.N., Pineda, A., Monedero, B.D., Antón, R.R., (2018) Estándares e indicadores para la calidad informativa en los medios digitales, , Standards and indicators for information quality in digital media Seville: Ediciones Egregius; Becerra, M., Mastrini, G., Concentración y convergencia de medios en América Latina Media concentration and convergence in Latin America (2017) Communiquer, 20, pp. 104-120; Birle, P., Thinking Latin America: Theoretical approaches and spaces of reflection (2016) Iberoamericana, 63 (16), pp. 7-13; Bleyen, V., Lindmark, S., Ranaivoson, H., Ballon, P., A typology of media innovations: Insights from an exploratory study (2014) The Journal of Media Innovations, 1 (1), pp. 28-51; Bouwman, H., Nikou, S., Molina-Castillo, F., de Reuver, M., The impact of digitalization on business models (2018) Digital Policy, Regulation and Governance, 20 (2), pp. 105-124; Cabezuelo-Lorenzo, F., Cinco años de crisis en el mercado de la comunicación (2008-2013) Five years of crisis in the communication market (2008-2013) (2013) Historia y Comunicación Social, 18, pp. 703-715; Carlson, M., Usher, N., News startups as agents of innovation (2016) Digital Journalism, 4 (5), pp. 563-581; Castells, M., (2010) The rise of the network society, , Malden: Blackwell; Cervi, L., Paredes, O., Pérez Tornero, J., Current trends of media literacy in Europe: An overview (2010) International Journal of Digital Literacy and Digital Competence, 1 (4), pp. 1-9; Chan-Olmsted, S., Shay, R., The new digital media value network: Proposing an interactive model of digital media value activities (2016) Icono14, 14 (2), pp. 46-74; Chaykowski, K., Facebook’s latest algorithm change: Here are the news sites that stand to lose the most (2018) Forbes, , https://www.forbes.com/sites/kathleenchaykowski/2018/03/06/facebooks-latest-algorithm-change-here-are-thenews-sites-that-stand-to-lose-the-most/#11c09af634ec, Retrieved from; Cottle, S., Ethnography and news production:New(s) developments in the field (2007) Sociology Compass, 1, pp. 1-16; Dailey, L., The convergence continuum: A model for studying collaboration between media newsrooms (2005) Atlantic Journal of Communication, 13, pp. 150-168; Del Rincón, D., Arnal, J., Latorre, A., Sans, A., (1995) Técnicas de investigación en ciencias sociales, , Techniques of social science research Madrid: Dykinson; Demil, B., Lecocq, X., Evolución de modelos de negocio: Hacia una visión de la estrategia en términos de coherencia dinámica Evolution of business models: Towards a vision of the strategy in terms of dynamic coherence (2009) Universia Business Review, 23, pp. 86-107; Deuze, M., The web and its journalisms: Considering the consequences of different types of newsmedia online (2003) New Media & Society, 5 (2), pp. 203-230; Domínguez, E., Pérez, J., (2012) Microperiodismos:Aventuras digitales en tiempos de crisis, , Micro- journalism: Digital adventures in times of crisis Barcelona: Universitat Oberta de Catalunya; Flores, J., Aguado, G., (2005) Modelos de negocio en el ciberperiodismo, , Business models in digital native news media Madrid: Fragua; Galindo, J., La Internet y sus redes sociales: Comunicología e ingeniería en comunicación social de un fenómeno aun emergente The Internet and its social networks: Communicology and engineering in social communication of a phenomenon still emerging (2010) Razón y Palabra, p. 71; García-Avilés, J.A., Carvajal-Prieto, M., De Lara-González, A., Arias-Robles, F., Developing an index of media innovation in a national market (2018) Journalism Studies, 19 (1), pp. 25-42; Gosciola, V., Narrativas transmídia: Conceituazao e origens Transmedia narratives: Conceptualization and origins (2012) Narrativas transmedia: Entre teorías y prácticas, , In C.

Although the advent of these media is not entirely negative, as they create multiple voices that contribute to pluralism, their quality has undoubtedly been questioned on several academic fronts. This work analyzes the most important Latin American digital native media by number of accesses (traffic), using a taxonomy of evaluation of dimensions of the informative quality, in which aspects such as informative sources, uses of international news agencies, correction of contents and factuality levels, ideological plurality in their opinion contents, among others, are taken into consideration. Of the emerging results, the ‘use of statistical indicators’ was the least rated (32.5%), mainly due to a lack of data journalism in the media studied. It is also worth noting that the indicator ‘comments and monitoring’ obtained the second-lowest rating, indicating an absence of conversation between the media and its audience through the comments section of each content. © 2020 by the author; licensee Cogitatio (Lisbon, Portugal).","Digital media; Fake news; Information quality; Journalism; Latin america",,,,,,"Ministerio de Ciencia, InnovaciÃ³n y Universidades, MCIU

The way news is produced and consumed in the digital era knocks down the boundaries that once divided professionals, citizens, and activists. At the same time, significant changes highlighted in recent studies call for a new theoretical and practical approach that goes beyond the dominant perspective of technological determinism. In relation with previous research, we have selected innovative digital media platforms (De Correspondent, Heidi.news, Eldiario.es, IlPost, Mediapart, and Observador), and we have analysed the types of journalism they set out to produce, as gleaned from their public-facing communications and interviews with the platforms’ founders and editors, comparing their stated goals with the journalism they produce and, lastly, we commented on changes in journalism. Digital native media explore renewed fields for journalism. The present analysis allows identifying the emergence of a series of trends in digital native media, which show a coexistence of traditional and new principles. Beyond the technological impact, the new media respond to the needs of society by incorporating the citizen as a reason for its purpose and as a collaborator in production processes. On the other hand, new players and an updated role of journalists come into play with innovative proposals designed for the current multiplatform and mobile scenario. © 2020 by the author; licensee Cogitatio (Lisbon, Portugal).","Digital journalism; Digital native media; Innovation; Journalism; Social media",,,,,,"Ministerio de Ciencia, InnovaciÃ³n y Universidades, MCIU

Paradoxically, their biggest expansion coincided with the Great Recession (2008-2014). In fact, their numbers increased most during 2012-2013, when traditional media were cutting staff in response to the economic crisis, and unemployment rates in the media sector as a whole hit their peak. However, these digital-native news startups have yet to prove their sustainability and stability. This study uses our own database of 3,862 native and nonnative digital news outlets in Spain and the Reuters Institute Digital News Report to analyze a number of characteristics of these media, such as the percentage that have gone inactive, the relative popularity of legacy brands vs. digital natives, multi-platform synergies, content subject matter, geographical location, ownership, and funding sources. Based on these quantitative parameters, this study reviews the structural strengths and weaknesses of digital-native media in the Spanish news market. Taking into account these findings, we conclude that the surge in digital-native news media observed in Spain during the Great Recession followed the pattern of creative destruction described by several economists. © 2020 by the author; licensee Cogitatio (Lisbon, Portugal).","Digital journalism; Digital-native media; Media economics; Online news; Spain",,,,,,"Ministerio de Ciencia, InnovaciÃ³n y Universidades, MCIU","This study received funding from the research project DIGINATIVEMEDIA, funded by the Spanish Ministry of Science, Innovation and Universities (No. RTI2018-093346-B-C31).",,,"Almiron, N., Segovia, A.I., Financialization, economic crisis, and corporate strategies in top media companies: The case of Grupo Prisa (2012) International Journal of Communication, 6, pp. 2894-2917. , https://ijoc.org/index.php/ijoc/article/view/1793, Retrieved from; Arrese, A., Vara-Miguel, A., A comparative study of metaphors in press reporting of the Euro crisis (2016) Discourse & Society, 27 (2), pp. 133-155. , https://doi.org/10.1177/0957926515611552; (2015) Informe anual de la profesión periodística 2015, , https://www.apmadrid.es/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/INFORME-PROFESION-APM-2015_baja_7M.pdf, Annual report of the journalistic profession 2015 Madrid: Asociación de la Prensa de Madrid, Retrieved from; (2019) Informe anual de la profesión periodística 2019, , Annual report of the journalistic profession 2019 Madrid: Asociación de la Prensa de Madrid; (2019) Informe i2p inversión publicitaria, , https://www.ami.info/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/i2p_primer_semestre_2019.pdf, i2p report on advertising investment Madrid: Asociación de Medios de la Información de España, Retrieved from; (2019) Marco general de los medios en España 2019, , https://www.aimc.es/a1mc-c0nt3nt/uploads/2019/01/marco19.pdf, General media framework in Spain 2019 Madrid: Asociación para la Investigación de Medios de Comunicación, Retrieved from; Boomgaarden, H., van Spanje, J., Vliegenthart, R., de Vreese, C., Covering the crisis: Media coverage of the economic crisis and citizens’ economic expectations (2011) Acta Polita, 46, pp. 353-379. , https://doi.org/10.1057/ap.2011.18; Boyles, J.L., The isolation of innovation: Restructuring the digital newsroom through intrapreneurship (2016) Digital Journalism, 4 (2), pp. 229-246. , https://doi.org/10.1080/21670811.2015.1022193; Bradshaw, P., (2018) The online journalism handbook, , Oxford and New York, NY: Routledge; Bruno, N., Nielsen, R.K., (2012) Survival is success:Journalistic online start-ups in Western Europe, , https://reutersinstitute.politics.ox.ac.uk/sites/default/files/2017-12/Survival%20is%20Success%20Journalistic%20Online%20Start-Ups%20in%20Western%20Europe.pdf, Oxford: Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism, Retrieved from; de Toro, J.M., Soldado, P., San Pedro, M., Breiner, J., Arrese, A., Vara-Miguel, A., Bel, I., (2017) La prensa digital en España 2016, , Digital media in Spain 2016 Madrid: Institute for Media & Entertainment and School of Communication, Universidad de Navarra; Doyle, G., Re-invention and survival: Newspapers in the era of digital multiplatform delivery (2013) Journal of Media Business Studies, 10 (4), pp. 1-20. , https://doi.org/10.1080/16522354.2013.11073569; El Confidencial cumple 18 años líder en audiencia y beneficios El Confidencial completes its 18th year as a leader in audience and profits (2019) El Confidencial, , https://blogs.elconfidencial.com/comunicacion/en-contacto/2019-06-20/elconfidencial-18aniversario-lideraudiencia-beneficios_2079513, Retrieved from; Eldiario.es, , https://l.eldiario.es/porque-necesitamos-socios, Retrieved from; Elliott, J.E., Marx and Schumpeter on capitalism’s creative destruction: A comparative restatement (1980) The Quarterly Journal of Economics, 95 (1), pp. 45-68. , https://doi.org/10.2307/1885348; Escolar, I., Las cuentas de eldiario.es en su sexto aniversario The financial results of eldiario.es on its sixth anniversary (2018) Eldiario.es, , https://www.eldiario.es/escolar/cuentas-eldiarioessexto-aniversario_6_818628133.html, Retrieved from; Foster, R., Kaplan, S., (2011) Creative destruction: Why companies that are built to last underperform the market-And how to successfully transform them, , New York, NY: Currency; García-Avilés, J.A., González-Esteban, J.L., Cibermedios nativos españoles: Explorando modelos de rentabilidad Digital-native media in Spain: Exploring profitable models (2012) Trípodos, 30, pp. 153-167; Gershon, R.A., Innovation failure: A case study analysis of Eastman Kodak and Blockbuster Inc (2013) Media management and economics research in a transmedia environment, pp. 62-84. , In G.

To this end, a multiple case study has been made to examine the way new digital outlets are using audio content. This qualitative research is made up of a variety of approaches, such as interviews, online surveys of podcasters, as well as the collection and analysis of secondary data. A specific aim of this comparative study was to include a sample of podcasts produced by thirteen emerging media platforms from eight countries registered in the directory of digital natives conducted by SembraMedia (https://www.sembramedia.org). This is a nonprofit organization dedicated to increasing the diversity and quality of Spanish language content by helping digital media entrepreneurs become more sustainable and successful. Results of this exploratory study reveal that native podcasting in Spanish is still expanding and that where the new media are small in scale, they are more oriented to the full exploitation of the narrative and innovative possibilities of this audio format and do not have responding to their target audiences’ needs as their main priority. These new media are finding different ways to become monetised (mainly content production for clients, sponsored content, sponsorship, consulting services, and advertising) and to make a profit. © 2020 by the authors; licensee Cogitatio (Lisbon, Portugal).","Business models; Digital native news media; Entrepreneurial journalism; Online journalism; Podcasting",,,,,,,,,,"Arrese, A., Kaufmann, J., Legacy and native news brands online: Do they show different news consumption patterns?

Against the background of general and journalism specific entrepreneurship literature, and in light of a practice-theoretical approach, this qualitative case study research on 15 German digital native news media outlets empirically investigates what barriers curb their innovative capacity in the early start-up phase. In the new media organizations under study here, there are-among other problems-a high degree of homogeneity within founding teams, tensions between journalistic and economic practices, insufficient user orientation, as well as a tendency for organizations to be underfinanced. The patterns of failure investigated in this study can raise awareness, help news start-ups avoid common mistakes before actually entering the market, and help industry experts and investors to realistically estimate the potential of new ventures within the digital news industry. © 2020 by the author; licensee Cogitatio (Lisbon, Portugal).","Digital native news media; Digital-born news media; Entrepreneurial journalism; News start-ups; Practice theories",,,,,,,"I would like to acknowledge the three reviewers as well as Laurenz Schreiner who all significantly contributed to the further development of this article.",,,"Alfon, D., (2017) Mediapart: A viable model?, , https://research.chicagobooth.edu/~/media/3F4732395D95446981EC784F9C381CC1.pdf, Chicago, IL: Stigler Center, Retrieved from; Arrese, A., Kaufmann, J., Legacy and native news brands online: Do they show different news consumption patterns?

Our study focuses on videos of the Syrian conflict shared on YouTube by the Russian state funded international broadcaster, RT. We propose that the concept of affective investment is a useful pivot between online videos of conflict and audience responses to them. Our study interrogates the role that affective investments play in 1) RT’s YouTube representations of the Syrian conflict, and 2) audience comments on these videos. We draw attention to the important intersections of RT’s representations of the conflict and audiences’ affective investments in those representations, and draw attention to the methodological issues raised. Our empirical focus is two critical junctures in the Syrian conflict: The commencement of Russia’s military intervention; and following the announcement of plans to withdraw Russian troops. We conclude by discussing the utility of affective investments in war when assessing online coverage of conflict, and suggesting avenues for further development. © 2019 by the authors.","Affective investments; Conflict; Emotion; International broadcaster; RT; Russia; Social media; Syria; War; YouTube",,,,,,"Arts and Humanities Research Council, AHRC: AH/P00508X/1","The research upon which this article was based was conducted under the auspices of ‘Reframing Russia for the Global Mediasphere: From Cold War to ‘Information War’?’, funded by the UK’s Arts and Humanities Research Council, ref: AH/P00508X/1.",,,"Åhäll, L., Affect as methodology: Feminism and the politics of emotion (2018) International Political Sociology, 12 (1). , https://doi.org/10.1093/ips/olx024; Åhäll, L., Gregory, T., (2015) Emotions, Politics and War, , Routledge; Ahmed, S., (2014) Cultural Politics of Emotion, , Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press; Al Nashmi, E., North, M., Bloom, T., Cleary, J., Promoting a global brand: A study of international news organisations’ YouTube channels (2017) The Journal of International Communication, 23 (2), pp. 165-185; Ampofo, L., Collister, S., Chadwick, A., Text mining and social media: When quantitative meets qualitative and software meets people (2015) Innovations in Digital Research Methods, pp. 161-192. , P.

The proliferation of online reader comments not only makes such opinions available but also alters the process of agenda formation and problem definition in the public space. Based on a dataset of 33,877 news items and 258,121 comments from a sample of regional Russian newspapers we investigate readers’ perceptions of social problems. We find that the volume of attention paid to issues or topics by the media and the importance of those issues for audiences, as judged by the number of their comments, diverge. Further, while the prevalence of general negative sentiment in comments accompanies such topics as disasters and accidents that are not perceived as social problems, a high level of sentiment polarization in comments does suggest issue problematization. It is also positively related to topic importance for the audience. Thus, instead of finding fixed social problem definitions in the reader comments, we observe the process of problem formation, where different points of view clash. These perceptions are not necessarily those expressed in media texts since the latter are predominantly “hard” news covering separate events, rather than trends or issues. As our research suggests, problematization emerges from readers’ background knowledge, external experience, or values. © 2019 by the authors.","Audience; Issue problematization; Online media; Reader; Russia; Sentiment analysis; Social problems; Topic modeling",,,,,,"National Research University Higher School of Economics, HES

The goal of this article is to study the peculiarities of deliberative practices in hybrid regimes, taking online discourse on the Russian antisanctions policy as a case. We use the Habermasian concept of basic validity claims to assess deliberation quality through the lens of argumentation and interactivity. Our findings suggest that deliberative practices can exist in non-competitive contexts and non-institutionalized digital spaces, in the form of intersubjective solidarities resulting from the everyday political talk among ordinary citizens. Such deliberations can be counted as argumentative discourses, although in a special, casual way-unlike the procedural rule-based debates. Generally, as in established liberal democracies, deliberation in Russia tends to attract like-minded participants. While the argumentative quality does not seem to vary across the discussion threads sample, the level of deliberative interactivity is higher on pro-government media, accompanied with the higher level of incivility. On the other hand, discourses on independent media are distinctively against the government policy of food destruction. The democratic value of such deliberations is unclear and might depend on the political allegiance and ownership of the media. Though some discourses can be considered democratic, their impact on decision-making remains minimal, which is a key constraint of deliberation. © 2019 by the authors.","Argumentation; Authoritarian deliberation; Civility; Deliberation; Interactivity; Internet discussions; Media; Online discourse; Validity claims",,,,,,"Russian Science Foundation, RSF: 18-18-00360 ‘E-participation","The research was supported by the Russian Science Foundation, grant № 18-18-00360 ‘E-participation as Politics and Public Policy Dynamic Factor’.",,,"Aragón, P., Gómez, V., Kaltenbrunner, A., Detecting platform effects in online discussions (2017) Policy & Internet, 9 (4), pp. 420-443; Åström, J., Karlsson, M., Linde, J., Pirannejad, A., Understanding the rise of e-participation in non-democracies: Domestic and international factors (2012) Government Information Quarterly, 29 (2), pp. 142-150; Bohman, J., (1996) Public Deliberation: Pluralism, Complexity, and Democracy, , Cambridge, MA: MIT Press; Bohman, J., Rehg, W., (1997) Deliberative Democracy: Essays on Reason and Politics, , (Eds.), Cambridge, MA: MIT Press; Chen, J., Xu, Y., Why do authoritarian regimes allow citizens to voice opinions publicly?

Recent research shows that, for political and issue-based discussions, patterns of user clusterization may differ significantly, but that cross-cultural evidence of the polarization of users on certain issues is close to non-existent. Furthermore, most of the studies developed network proxies to detect users’ grouping, rarely taking into account the content of the Tweets themselves. Our contribution to this scholarly discussion is founded upon the detection of polarization based on attitudes towards political actors expressed by users in Germany, the USA and Russia within discussions on inter-ethnic conflicts. For this exploratory study, we develop a mixed-method approach to detecting user grouping that includes: Crawling for data collection; expert coding of Tweets; user clusterization based on user attitudes; construction of word frequency vocabularies; and graph visualization. Our results show that, in all the three cases, the groups detected are far from being conventionally left or right, but rather that their views combine anti-institutionalism, nationalism, and pro- and anti-minority views in varying degrees. In addition to this, more than two threads of political debate may co-exist in the same discussion. Thus, we show that the debate that sees Twitter as either a platform of ‘echo chambering’ or ‘opinion crossroads’ may be misleading. In our opinion, the role of local political context in shaping (and explaining) user clusterization should not be under-estimated. © 2019 by the authors; licensee Cogitatio (Lisbon, Portugal).","Echo chamber; Inter-ethnic conflict; Political polarization; Social media; Twitter",,,,,,"Russian Science Foundation, RSF: 16-18-10125-P (2016– 2018","We are grateful to Olessia Koltsova (Russia) and Christian Baden (Israel) for their comments on early versions of the article, as well as to our international team of coders.

The content published by news organizations on social networking sites is of particular value to sociologists, because it allows measurement of users’ attitude to certain events. However, we understand that the media choose which events become news in accordance with certain criteria, such as news values. In this study, we decided to examine how news values determine the public’s response as expressed by likes, reposts, and comments. To analyze the characteristics of different media and their audiences, we selected four popular newsgroups on the social networking site Vkontakte: TASS and Russia Today, representing the state media, alongside RBC and Meduza, representing the private media. The posts of the selected newsgroups were coded and analyzed by means of Harcup and O’Neill taxonomy of values (2016). The study showed that news organizations tend to have preferences for some news values rather than others. Regression analysis revealed positive relationships between 1) the sharing of likes and good and entertaining content, 2) the sharing of comments and the presence of celebrities or conflicts in news, 3) the sharing of reposts and comments and significant events. An unexpected discovery was a negative dependency between the number of comments and the presence of exclusive content. © 2019 by the authors.","Audience; Media agenda; News organizations; News values; Newsworthiness; Russia; Social media; Social networks",,,,,,"Saint Petersburg State University, SPbU","We would like to thank our colleagues from the Faculty of Applied Mathematics and Control Processes and the Center for Sociological and Internet Research of Saint Petersburg State University for guidance and support.",,,"Almgren, S.M., Olsson, T., Lets get them involved’ to some extent: Analyzing online news participation (2015) Social Media + Society, 1 (2). , https://doi.org/10.1177/2056305115621934; Al-Rawi, A., News values on social media: News organizations’ Facebook use (2017) Journalism, 18 (7), pp. 871-889; Armstrong, C.L., Gao, F., Now tweet this: How news organizations use Twitter (2010) Electronic News, 4 (4), pp. 218-235; Bednarek, M., Caple, H., (2017) The Discourse of News Values: How News Organizations Create Newsworthiness, , New York, NY: Oxford University Press; Campbell, J.L., Quincy, C., Osserman, J., Pedersen, O.K., Coding in-depth semistructured interviews: Problems of unitization and intercoder reliability and agreement (2013) Sociological Methods & Research, 42 (3), pp. 294-320; Cohen, R., Ruths, D., Classifying political orientation on Twitter: It’s not easy!

A revived conceptualization of the Russian media as a uniform system driven by a well-coordinated propagandistic state effort, though having evidence thereunder, does not allow seeing the public discussion inside Russia as a more diverse and multifaceted process. This is especially true for the Russian-language mediated discussions online, which, in the recent years, have proven to be efficient enough in raising both social issues and waves of political protest, including on-street spillovers. While, in the recent years, several attempts have been made to demonstrate the complexity of the Russian media system at large, the content and structures of the Russian-language online discussions remain seriously understudied. The thematic issue draws attention to various aspects of online public discussions in Runet; it creates a perspective in studying Russian mediated communication at the level of Internet users. The articles are selected in the way that they not only contribute to the systemic knowledge on the Russian media but also add to the respective subdomains of media research, including the studies on social problem construction, news values, political polarization, and affect in communication. © 2019 by the authors.","Public discussion; Runet; Russia; Russian media; Social media",,,,,,,,,,"Bennett, W.L., Segerberg, A., The logic of connective action: Digital media and the personalization of contentious politics (2012) Information, Communication & Society, 15 (5), pp. 739-768; Bodrunova, S.S., Blekanov, I., Smoliarova, A., Litvinenko, A., Beyond left and right: Real-world political polarization in Twitter discussions on interethnic conflicts (2019) Media and Communication, 7 (3), pp. 119-132; Bodrunova, S.S., Litvinenko, A., Fragmentation of society and media hybridisation in today’s Russia: How Facebook voices collective demands (2016) Journal of Social Policy Research, 14 (1), pp. 113-124; Castells, M., Communication, power and counterpower in the network society (2007) International Journal of Communication, 1 (1), p. 29; Chatterje-Doody, P.N., Crilley, R., Making sense of emotions and affective investments in war: RT and the Syrian conflict on YouTube (2019) Media and Communication, 7 (3), pp. 167-178; Diani, M., Social movement networks virtual and real (2000) Information, Communication & Society, 3 (3), pp. 386-401; Enikolopov, R., Makarin, A., Petrova, M., (2018) Social Media and Protest Participation: Evidence from Russia, , http://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.2696236, Unpublished manuscript; Filatova, O., Kabanov, Y., Misnikov, Y., Public deliberation in Russia: Deliberative quality, rationality and interactivity of the online media discussions (2019) Media and Communication, 7 (3), pp. 133-144; Filer, T., Fredheim, R., Sparking debate?

This is because citizens trusted mass media as an independent information channel, and social media like Twitter was unavailable. Following mass media’s affiliation to political parties and the rise of social media, citizens began using Twitter for delivering news or information. We dub this as citizen journalism from street to tweet. This study found that such process indicates the waning of mass media and the intensification of social media. Yet, the process neither strengthened citizen journalism nor increased public participation as it resulted in netizens experiencing severe polarization between groups critical and in support of the government instead. We consider this as a new emerging phenomenon caused by the advent of new media in the post-truth era. In this context, post-truth refers to social and political conditions wherein citizens no longer respect the truth due to political polarization, fake-news-producing journalist, hate-mongering citizen journalism, and unregulated social media activities. Primary data were obtained through in-depth interviews with four informants. While conversation data of netizens on Twitter were acquired from a Twitter conversation reader operated by DEA (Drone Emprit Academic), a big data system capable of capturing and analyzing netizen’s conversations, particularly on Twitter in real time. This study may have implications on the shift of citizen journalism due to its presence in the era of new media. The most salient feature in this new period is the obscurity of news, information, and opinions conveyed by citizens via social media, like Twitter. © 2019 by the authors; licensee Cogitatio (Lisbon, Portugal).","Citizen journalism; Indonesia; Mass media; New media; Public participation; Social media; Twitter",,,,,,,,,,"Adi, D.S., Public jour-nalism & citizen journalism and their role in raising public participation in the democracy process (2016) Nomosleca, 2 (1), pp. 342-365; Asur, S., Huberman, B.A., Predicting the future with social media (2010) Proceedings of IEEE/WIC/ACM International Conference on Web Intelligence, , https://arxiv.org/pdf/1003.5699.pdf, Washington, DC: IEEE Computer Society; Ausserhofer, J., Maireder, A., National politics on Twitter: Structures and topics of a networked public sphere (2013) Information, Communication & Society, 16 (3), pp. 291-314; Ball-Rokeach, S.J., Gutierrez-Hoyt, E., Communication technology and community (2001) Communication Research, 28 (4), pp. 355-357; Besserman, L., The challenge of periodization: Old paradigms and new perspectives (1998) Speculum, 73 (3), p. 923; Bruns, A., Burgess, J.E., (2011) The Use of Twitter Hashtags in the Formation of Ad Hoc Publics.

However, environmental agencies and other reporters often disseminate this critical data only in siloed repositories and in technically complex, inconsistent formats, limiting its impact. We have developed a new open source web resource, the Archive of Massachusetts ENvironmental Data or AMEND, which curates information relating to federal, state, and local environmental stewardship in Massachusetts, focused on water quality. We describe the construction of AMEND, its operation, and the datasets we have integrated to date. This tool supports the development and advocacy of policy positions with published analyses that are fully reproducible, versioned, and archived online. As a case study, we present the first publicly reported analysis of the distributional impact of combined sewer overflows on Environmental Justice (EJ) communities. Our analysis of the historical geospatial distribution of these sewer overflows and block-level US Census data on EJ indicators tracking race, income, and linguistic isolation demonstrates that vulnerable communities in Massachusetts are significantly overburdened by this form of pollution. We discuss applications of this analysis to the state-level legislative process in Massachusetts. We believe that this approach to increasing the accessibility of regulatory data, and the code underlying AMEND, can serve as a model for other civic organizations seeking to leverage data to build trust with and advocate to policymakers and the public. © 2019 by the author; licensee Cogitatio (Lisbon, Portugal).","Advocacy; Databases; Environmental data; Environmental justice; Massachusetts; Open source; Policy; Water quality",,,,,,,,,,"Abel, D., (2016) State Seeks to Take over Water Pollution Regulation from EPA, , https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2016/03/27/state-seeks-take-over-pollution-controls-from-federal-government/iwXuRG56OFHYB6FhDpPs5N/story.html, Boston Globe.

As ICTs in the civic sector, otherwise known as civic tech, get adopted with greater regularity in large and small organizations, there is need to understand how these technologies shape and challenge the nature of civic work. Based on a nine-month ethnographic study of one organization in Boston and additional interviews with fourteen other organizations throughout the United States, the study addresses a guiding research question: how do CBOs reconcile the changing (increasingly mediated) nature of civic work as ICTs, and their effective adoption and use for civic purposes, increasingly represent forward-thinking, progress, and innovation in the civic sector?—of civic tech as a measure of “keeping up with the times.” From a sense of top-down pressures to innovate in a fast-moving civic sector, to changing bottom-up media practices among community constituents, our findings identify four tensions in the daily practice of civic tech, including: 1) function vs. representation, 2) amplification vs. transformation, 3) grassroots vs. grasstops, and 4) youth vs. adults. These four tensions, derived from a grounded theory approach, provide a conceptual picture of a civic tech landscape that is much more complicated than a suite of tools to help organizations become more efficient. The article concludes with recommendations for practitioners and researchers. © 2019 by the authors; licensee Cogitatio (Lisbon, Portugal).","Civic sector; Civic technology; Community based organizations; Community organizing; Information communication technologies; Innovation; Youth media",,,,,,"John S. and James L.

While removing barriers is vital in many matters of governance, should it always be the aim of civic technology? In our ongoing ethnographic research to understand the work of community engagement performed by public officials in local government, we have observed how this orientation around efficiency in civic technology can inadvertently create distance in the relationships between citizens and governments. In this article, we discuss how an orientation around trust could open a space for civic technology that primarily aims to close distance in the relationships between citizens and public officials. We do so by first providing an account of how trust functions in the work of public officials performing community engagement, calling attention to where and when efficiency is at odds with the importance of relationship building between public officials and citizens. We build on ethnographic findings and a series of co-design activities with public officials to develop three strategies that operate under the logic of trust: historicizing engagement, focusing on experience, and mediating expectations. In all, by focusing on trust and the relational work of closing distance, civic technology can move towards addressing the growing crisis in confidence being faced in democracies. © 2019 by the authors; licensee Cogitatio (Lisbon, Portugal).","Civic relationships; Civic technology; Community engagement; Democracy; Local government; Trust",,,,,,"National Science Foundation, NSF: IIS-1524380

Our findings focus on organizational staff’s relationships with information and communication technologies (ICTs), both in the course of their daily work of delivering care work to vulnerable participants, as well as the project’s broader political goals to reduce recidivism and repair community relationships with local police. The group needed to distinguish and negotiate the various—and often competing—needs and commitments of the civic actors involved. As on-site researchers, we were asked to design and deploy digital tools to support the organization in exchange for conducting research on organizational uses of technology. This work draws from our time with the group to ask: how might community-based researchers revisit and realign our research methods to better respond to the changing needs and practices of a research site? Our observations identified three recurring technological concerns expressed by staff that pointed to competing agendas and needs within the organization, specifically across different levels of scale: operational, proximal, and temporal. We then discuss these patterns around broader organizational concerns to reflect on how they impacted our own research methods and commitments. Finally, we reflect on the limitations of participatory methods in issue-oriented organizations that do progressive work across multiple scales and agendas. © 2019 by the authors; licensee Cogitatio (Lisbon, Portugal).","Civic engagement; Community-based research; Public sector; Social service; Social work",,,,,,"National Science Foundation, NSF: 1659757","We are grateful to the NSF for generously funding this work (1659757).

However, discussion networks are an integral part of individuals’ information diets. This article extends the selective exposure literature by exploring the potential for networks to likewise be selectively accessed. A pre-registered experiment found that participants nominate denser, more ideologically coherent networks in response to congenial political news relative to uncongenial news, and express willingness to share it with more people. Analysis of open-ended data suggest shared political beliefs are more likely to motivate discussant selection in response to congenial, rather than uncongenial, news. Properties of networks generated in response to political and non-political news did not vary. These results provide nuance to our understanding of political information exposure. © 2019 by the author; licensee Cogitatio (Lisbon, Portugal).","Discussion networks; Information seeking; Polarization; Selective exposure; Social identity",,,,,,"European Research Council, ERC

In this commentary I explore psychological conditions as they apply to attitude-based selection and make an argument that selectivity does not stop at exposure but continues as audiences engage with information they encounter and incorporate in their decision-making.

Particularly in the run-up to elections, knowledge of such threats is essential for citizens to cast an informed vote. Against this background, the present study examined the likelihood of media users to engage with political news providing critical perspectives on populist movements in a 24-hour social media field experiment during the 2017 federal election campaign in Germany (N = 210). Based on two selective exposure measures, findings suggest that exposure to critical news is contingent upon the conceptualization of populist partisanship as a political orientation of either high commitment (i.e., voting intention) or high affinity (i.e., sympathy for a party). While high commitment triggered a rather classic confirmation bias, especially regarding click decisions, high affinity caused selection patterns to be more strongly guided by informational utility, particularly during newsfeed browsing, with counter-attitudinal information receiving more attention. When public sentiment cues were present, however, attitudinal patterns disappeared. These findings imply that partisan news use in times of political upheaval is best gauged by taking a closer look at the particular type of partisanship that guides selective exposure, as both types of partisanship caused contrary exposure patterns, and that today’s news environments potentially override attitudinal influences by providing additional social monitoring cues. © 2019 by the authors; licensee Cogitatio (Lisbon, Portugal).","Confirmation bias; Incidental exposure; Informational utility; Online opinion; Partisanship; Populism; Selective exposure; Social endorsements; Social media",,,,,,,,,,"Arendt, F., Fawzi, N., Googling for Trump: Investigating online information seeking during the 2016 US presidential election (2018) Information¸ Commu-nication¸ and Society.

So far, however, selective exposure research has exclusively studied news selection based on textual cues, ignoring the recent proliferation of visual media. This study aimed to identify the contribution of visuals alongside text in selective exposure to pro-attitudinal, counter-attitudinal and balanced content. Using two experiments, we created a social media-style newsfeed with news items comprising matching and non-matching images and headlines about the contested issues of immigration and gun control in the U.S. By comparing selection behavior of participants with opposing prior attitudes on these topics, we pulled apart the contribution of images and headlines to selective exposure. Findings show that headlines play a far greater role in guiding selection, with the influence of images being minimal. The additional influence of partisan source cues is also considered. © 2019 by the authors; licensee Cogitatio (Lisbon, Portugal).","Balanced content; Experimental research; Image; Selective exposure; Text; Visual communication",,,,,,,,,,"Arceneaux, K., Johnson, M., Changing minds or changing channels?

Video games, in particular, have been shown to fulfil various aspects of recovery, not least due to their ability to elicit feelings of mastery and control. However, little is known about the role of cognitive task demand (i.e., the amount of cognitive effort a task requires) in that process. Toward this end, our study aimed to investigate how cognitive task demand during gameplay affects users’ recovery experiences. Results of a laboratory experiment suggest that different dimensions of the recovery experiences seem to respond to different levels of cognitive task demand. While control experiences were highest under low cognitive task demand, there was no difference between groups regarding experiences of mastery and psychological detachment. Nevertheless, both gaming conditions outperformed the control condition regarding experiences of mastery and psychological detachment. Controlling for personal gaming experiences, relaxation was higher in the low cognitive task demand condition compared to the control condition. Findings are discussed in terms of their implications for research on the multilayered recovery effects of interactive media. © 2019, Cogitatio Press.

By identifying and exploring elements of infrastructure in multiplayer games, this paper augments Bowman’s (2018) conceptualization of demands in video games by introducing a new category of ‘infrastructure demand’ of games. This article describes how the infrastructure increasingly built around video games creates demands upon those interacting with these games, either as players, spectators, or facilitators of multiplayer video game play. We follow the method described by Susan Leigh Star (1999), who writes that infrastructure is as mundane as it is a critical part of society and as such is particularly deserving of academic study. When infrastructure works properly it fades from view, but in doing so loses none of its importance to human endeavor.

Recent research has suggested to extend analysis from cognitive and physical to the social and emotional demands of gameplay. This article argues that Erving Goffman’s concept of interaction tension offers a promising theoretical model for social demands. We report a re-analysis of qualitative interview data on the social norms of video gaming corroborating the model. As suggested by Goffman (1961) for gaming, video gaming features rich social norms regarding involvement. When spontaneously experienced and normatively demanded involvement misalign, players experience self-conscious disinvolvement and engage in unenjoyable, effortful self-control of their experienced and displayed involvement. © 2019, Cogitatio Press.

These attentive access norms were supported by material arrangements like removing mirrors from the walls. We found similar norms and practices in video gaming.

Within the cognitive realm, playing games belonging to one particular genre, known as the action video game genre, has been consistently linked with demands on a host of cognitive abilities including perception, top-down attention, multitasking, and spatial cognition. More recently, a number of new game genres have emerged that, while different in many ways from “traditional” action games, nonetheless seem likely to load upon similar cognitive processes. One such example is the multiplayer online battle arena genre (MOBA), which involves a mix of action and real-time strategy characteristics. Here, a sample of over 500 players of the MOBA game League of Legends completed a large battery of cognitive tasks. Positive associations were observed between League of Legends performance (quantified by participants’ in-game match-making rating) and a number of cognitive abilities consistent with those observed in the existing action video game literature, including speed of processing and attentional abilities. Together, our results document a rich pattern of cognitive abilities associated with high levels of League of Legends performance and suggest similarities between MOBAs and action video games in terms of their cognitive demands. © 2019, Cogitatio Press.

Advances in technology and creativity have combined to present players with interactive experience that vary in their cognitive, emotional, physical, and social complexity. That video games constitute co-authored experiences—dialogues between the player and the system—is at least one explanation for their appeal, but this co-authorship brings with it an enhanced set of requirements for the player’s attention. For this thematic issue, researchers were invited to debate and examine the cognitive, emotional, physical, and social demands of video games; their work (as well as the impetus for this work) is summarized below. © 2019, Cogitatio Press.

However, the present article aims to expand this framework and apply it to problematic gaming, also known as trolling. Although still a relatively new field, research into trolling has exploded within the past ten years. However, the vast majority of these studies are descriptive in nature. The present article marries theory and trolling research by closely examining interdisciplinary empirical evidence from a single platform—video games—and applying the various forms of demands to propose a testable, dual-route model of trolling behaviour. Within the video game context, I argue the presence of two primary causal mechanisms that can lead to trolling: 1) Demand imbalance between players and the game; and 2) demand imbalance between players. The article discusses how these two types of imbalance can lead to trolling, which kinds of demands can be imbalanced, and how future researchers can use the demand framework to expand our understanding of trolling. © 2019, Cogitatio Press.

An extensive collection of theories and models within the field of media psychology assume the multimodal nature of media stimuli, yet there is current ambiguity as to the independent contributions of visual and auditory content to message complexity and to resource availability in the human processing system. In this article, we argue that explicating the concepts of perceptual and cognitive load can create progress toward a deeper understanding of modality-specific effects in media processing. In addition, we report findings from an experiment showing that perceptual load leads to modality-specific reductions in resource availability, whereas cognitive load leads to a modality-general reduction in resource availability. We conclude with a brief discussion regarding the critical importance of separating modality-specific forms of load in an increasingly multisensory media environment. © 2019, Cogitatio Press.

So demanding that our screen heroes and heroines are constantly making sounds of strife, struggle, or victory while conducting surrogate labor for us running, fighting, saving worlds. These sounds also represent the very real demanding labor of voice actors, whose burnout and vocal strain have recently come to the fore in terms of the games industries’ labor standards (Cazden, 2017). But do heroes and she-roes sound the same? What are the demands—virtual, physical, and emotional—of maintaining sexist sonic tropes in popular media; demands that are required of the industry, the game program, and the player alike? Based on participatory observations of gameplay (i.e., the research team engaging with the material by playing the games we study), close reading of gendered sonic presence, and a historical content analysis of three iconic arcade fighting games, this article reports on a notable trend: As games selfpurportedly and in the eyes of the wider community improve the visual representation of female playable leads important aspects of the vocal representation of women has not only lagged behind but become more exaggeratedly gendered with higher-fidelity bigger-budget game productions. In essence, femininity continues to be a disempowering design pattern in ways far more nuanced than sexualization alone. This media ecology implicates not only the history of best practices for the games industry itself, but also the culture of professional voice acting, and the role of games as trendsetters for industry conventions of media representation.

In this essay I reflect on an ongoing research agenda examining one particular category of interlopers: Provocative media actors who have openly challenged the boundaries of the journalistic field. These actors raise questions as to how to account for interlopers at the edges of the journalistic field, including whether we should extend the field to include them. In this essay I argue we should continue to see the field as complex, and maybe now a bit more so. Reflecting on field and practice theories and understandings of boundaries, I reengage the complexity that is a core demand of conceptualizing the journalistic field, while offering ways to consider interlopers’ journalistic identities within its boundaries. Emphasizing similarities over differences, I argue we can move beyond binary distinctions between a field’s core members and interlopers on the periphery by focusing on the nature of interloper work. © 2019, Cogitatio Press.

While this has raised the potential for the disruption of existing social orders, such heterogeneous assemblages also provide fruitful grounds for substantive innovation within “trading zones”. This article explores one such potential zone, the code-sharing platform GitHub, delineating the primary actors oriented around the boundary object of “news”, the objectives of their projects, the nature of their collaborations, and their use of software licenses. The analysis examines attributes of 88,776 news-oriented project repositories, with a smaller subsample subjected to a manual content analysis. Findings show that this trading zone consisted primarily of journalistic outsiders; repositories focused on technological solutions to distributional challenges and efforts that made journalism more transparent; that there was limited direct trade via the use of collaborative affordances on the platform; and that only a minority of repositories employed a permissive license favored by open-source advocates. This leads to a broader conclusion that while GitHub may be discursively important within journalism and certainly provides an avenue for actors to enter journalism’s periphery, it offers a limited pathway for those peripheral actors to move closer to the center of journalism. That, in turn, impacts the platform’s—and its users’—ability to reconfigure if not spur a reimagining of journalism’s meanings, conventions, and allocations of different forms of capital. © 2019, Cogitatio Press.

The campaign originated in the US with an anonymous Twitter account that enlisted followers in encouraging brands to pull their online advertising from Breitbart News. The campaign achieved dramatic success and rapidly spread to regions outside the US, with other anonymously run and loosely allied chapters emerging in 15 different nations (as well as a regional chapter for the EU). Many of these were initially created to take on Breitbart advertisers in their home countries, but in a number of cases they subsequently turned their attention to disrupting financial support for other far-right news media in—or impacting—their home countries. Based on interviews with leaders of eight Sleeping Giants chapters, as well as the related UK-based Stop Funding Hate campaign, this study examines the Sleeping Giants campaign with respect to its continuity with media activism of previous eras, while also seeking to understand its potential as one of the first high-profile activist campaigns to grapple with the impacts of programmatic advertising on the news ecosystem. In particular, we consider how the campaign’s interventions speak to the larger debate around the normative relationship between advertising and the performance of the news ecosystem. © 2019, Cogitatio Press.

They have been called interlopers, strangers, new entrants, peripheral, and emergent actors, among others. As journalism scholars grapple with how to refer to these actors, it is important to reflect on the assumptions that underlie emerging labels. These include: 1) what journalistic tasks are involved; 2) how and why these journalistic tasks are performed; 3) who is making the definition; and 4) where and when these actors are located. However, journalism being the centre of our investigation should not automatically assume that it is at the centre of social life. So, it might also be that for the technological field, journalism is at the periphery; that for these technology-oriented actors whose influence across fields is increasing, journalists and what they do are at the periphery. For a field that supposedly plays an important role in public life, this has important implications. © 2019, Cogitatio Press.

Participation can challenge established understandings of journalism and affect the relationship between journalists and audience members as peripheral actors due to the increasingly blurred boundaries between these actors and the renegotiation of authority and power. The review captures research practices regarding the theoretical, conceptual and empirical approach as well as results pertaining to the impact participation has on the journalist–audience relationship and is both interdisciplinary and global in nature. The results show that research mostly focuses on journalism in Europe and North America and examines participation in the interpretation stage rather than in the formation or dissemination stage of the news production process. Longitudinal and comparative studies, examinations of regional and local participation, in-depth audience studies as well as analyses of participation in all three production stages are rare. 121 studies explicitly deal with participation’s impact on the journalist–audience relationship and produce conflicting results: 51% see journalists retaining control over news production process; 42% see shared power; and 7% see mixed results. Notably, power structures differ depending on the examined world region, production stage, and actor perspective. The review illustrates the status quo of research practices as well as the role the audience as peripheral actors play in the news production process and concludes with five observations about the field as well as future avenues to close identified research gaps. © 2019, Cogitatio Press.

What is presented here is not a typical empirical social science research study but the culmination of an entire approach that is oriented toward software development. This article’s aim is to present the project’s conceptual ideas, its interdisciplinary character, its research-based development approach and the concept for a local news platform that grew out of our preliminary work. At each level we focus on the relationality which arises in the figurations of the actors involved and their various perspectives. First, we illustrate how relationality already shaped the objective of our project and how this results in its interdisciplinary structure and research design. We then discuss this idea with reference to our empirical findings, that is, the paradox of the local public sphere: While all the actors we interviewed—those who (professionally) produce content and those who use it—have a high appreciation for the idea of a local public sphere, the mediated connection to this sphere is diminishing at the same time. We understand this as the real challenge for local journalism and the local public sphere at large, and not just for individual media organizations. This is also the reason why we argue for a fundamentally relational approach: From a theoretical point of view, it can be used to grasp the crisis of the local public; from a practical point of view, relationality represents the core characteristic of the platform in development. On this basis, we will then show how the concept of the experimental local news platform evolved through the use of a prototype as a relational boundary object. This development lead to the conceptualization of the platform molo.news which itself is characterized by a fourfold relationality. Our concluding argument is that approaching relationality in a more rigorous way could be the key to exploring the future of local journalism. © 2019, Cogitatio Press.

Valorization occurs when they engage with, and challenge, journalism from the global north, and the opposite occurs when they do the same for the local fields. Focusing on the former and not the latter is a disservice to the complicated and nuanced relationship these actors have with the journalism field and perpetuates a mythologized and romanticized narrative about the redemptive qualities of online platforms. © 2019, Cogitatio Press.

Based on two rounds of interviews, it finds that peripheral players are gradually recognised for their contributions to journalism by traditional actors. Nonetheless, as barriers between the two groups lower, tensions involving dissonant professional perspectives, practices, and jurisdictions surface and are negotiated. The findings indicate a growing salience of hybrid roles in newsrooms that serve as linchpins to connect divergent professional fields, and more importantly, as bridges between tradition and innovation. Based on the increasing importance of collaboration and hybrid roles, this study makes a theoretical and practical contribution to research and media management by proposing that four forms of proximity—physical, temporal, professional, and control—are crucial in operationalising the impact that peripheral players have on innovation in news organisations. © 2019, Cogitatio Press.

Much of the research on peripheral actors has examined individual actors, focusing on questions of identity such as who is a journalist as opposed to emergent and complex institutions with multiple interventions in a time of field transition. Our study explores the role of what we term a ‘complex peripheral actor,’ a journalism actor that may operate across individual, organizational, and network levels, and is active across multiple domains of the journalistic process, including production, publication, and dissemination. This lens is relevant to the North American journalism landscape as digitalization has seen increasing interest in and growth of complex and contested peripheral actors, such as Google, Facebook, and Apple News. Results of this case study point to increasing recognition of The Conversation Canada as a legitimate journalism actor indicated by growing demand for its content from legacy journalism organizations experiencing increasing market pressures in Canada, in addition to demand from a growing number of peripheral journalism actors. We argue that complex peripheral actors are benefitting from changes occurring across the media landscape from economic decline to demand for free journalism content, as well as the proliferation of multiple journalisms. © 2019, Cogitatio Press.

It looks more specifically at the question of who does journalism and news and what that may signal for power dependencies, status, and norms formation. It examines how authors who contributed to this thematic issue define who gets to decide what is news and journalism, what forms of power are exerted amongst groups, who gets to claim status, and how norms and epistemologies are formed. Ultimately, this essay illustrates how conformity to groups and organizations varies with the investments that these social actors have to core and more peripheral journalism and media groups. © 2019, Cogitatio Press.

The rapidly expanding role of foundations as a revenue source for news publishers raises an important question: How do foundations exercise their influence over the newsrooms they fund? Using the hierarchy of influence model, this study utilizes more than 40 interviews with journalists at digitally native nonprofit news organizations and employees from foundations that fund nonprofit journalism to better understand the impact of foundation funding on journalistic practice. Drawing on previous scholarship exploring extra-media influence on the news industry, we argue that the impact of foundations on journalism parallels that of advertisers throughout the 20th century—with one important distinction: Journalism practitioners and researchers have long forbidden the influence from advertisers on editorial decisions, seeing the blurring of the two as inherently unethical. Outside funding from foundations, on the other hand, is often premised on editorial influence, complicating efforts by journalists to maintain the firewall between news revenue and production. © 2019, Cogitatio Press.

Among the recent successes of collaborative investigative journalism was the cross-border effort to expose the tax haven leaks that included the Panama Papers (2016). Due to such notable accomplishments, research on cross-border collaboration is increasing, but the ways in which this pooling of resources, time, and networks has impacted practice on a daily basis remain underinvestigated. This article looks at how organizations and actors in emerging and legacy newsrooms are negotiating their routines and roles while developing new practices in investigative journalism. It uses three organizations as cases: Bristol Cable, a journalistic co-op operating at the community/local level; the Bureau Local, a local/national data-coordinating news desk; and The Guardian, a legacy media company that has long operated at the national/global level. This article finds that, in the transitions of traditional organizations and journalists and the emergence of new innovative organizations and non-journalistic actors, actors involved in collaborative investigative journalism deploy a language of justification regarding rules between the new and the old. It also finds that concepts such as coordination are part of this negotiation, and that knowledge and knowledge generation are taking place within a traditional understanding of journalism, as the “new” is normalized over time. © 2019, Cogitatio Press.

While ‘legacy’ news media continue to be easily distinguishable by set characteristics, new content providers operating in an increasingly dense, chaotic, interactive, and participatory information environment still remain somewhat understudied. However, at a time when non-traditional formats account for an ever-growing portion of journalistic or para-journalistic work, there is an urgent need to better understand these new peripheral actors and the ways they may be transforming the journalistic field. While journalism scholarship has begun to examine peripheral actors’ motivations and conceptualizations of their roles, our understanding is still fairly limited. This relates particularly to comparative studies of peripheral actors, of which there have been very few, despite peripheral journalism being a global phenomenon. This study aims to address this gap by presenting evidence from 18 in-depth interviews with journalists in Australia, Germany, and the UK. In particular, it examines how novel journalistic actors working for a range of organisations discursively contrast their work from that of others. The findings indicate that journalists’ motivations to engage in journalism in spite of the rise of precarious labour were profoundly altruistic: Indeed, journalists pledged allegiance to an ideology of journalism still rooted in a pre-crisis era—one which sees journalism as serving a public good by providing an interpretative, sense-making role. © 2019, Cogitatio Press.

Vigilantism also takes place within this migrant ‘community’ where male Kyrgyz labour migrants engage in retaliation on female migrants over perceived offences such as dating non-Kyrgyz men. On several occasions between 2011 and 2016 videos featuring honour beating of female labour migrants by fellow countrymen shook the internet. The selected case illustrates vulnerabilities experienced by migrants due to xenophobia and hostility of the host state, as well as additional layers of vulnerabilities linked to gendered biases that ‘travel’ across borders along with compatriots in migration. The study argues that offline structures, norms, biases, violence, and stigma not only reincarnate online, where they culminate in vigilante acts, but consequently, they re-enter the offline discourse and go through further normalization and justification. © 2019 by the authors.","Digital divides; Digital vigilantism; Labour migrants; Layers of vulnerabilities",,,,,,"Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek, NWO: 276-45-004

Relative to the other three, (explicit) business efforts toward refugee (economic) integration are yet sporadic, limited to a few large organizations. While acknowledging that integration encompasses multiple spheres and is complicated by national and local variations across EU member states, this conceptual article treats business support of refugee (economic) integration as a manifestation of corporate social responsibility (CSR) and contends that such efforts may enhance employee-organizational identification. Drawing on scholarship from CSR and organization-employee identification, we develop a conceptual model including propositions about mediating and moderating mechanisms of the relationship among refugee integration, CSR communication and employee-organizational identification. Our study offers a conceptual bridge between what is known about the importance, barriers and enablers of refugee labor market integration with the lesser-known organizational, specifically employee, perspectives on the issue. Leveraging on this conceptual framework, further research may focus on testing the relationship empirically through collecting field data from business firms which have made an explicit claim on refugee support. © 2019 by the authors.",,,,,,,,,,,"Ager, A., Strang, A., Understanding integration: A conceptual framework (2008) Journal of Refugee Studies, 21 (2), pp. 166-191; New report: Refugees are an opportunity for humanity (2016) B-Team., , http://www.bteam.org/announcements/newreport-refugees-are-an-opportunity-for-humanity, October 20, Retrieved from; Bauman, C.W., Skitka, L.J., Corporate social responsibility as a source of employee satisfaction (2012) Research in Organizational Behavior, 32, pp. 63-86; Betts, A., Refugees and innovation (2014) Forced Migration Review, 2014., , https://www.fmreview.org/innovation/contents, Retrieved from; Betts, A., Buith, J., Talent displaced: The economic lives of Syrian refugees in Europe.

While the flows of displaced persons, especially from the Middle East into Europe, had been ongoing until that date, this event and its coverage sparked a media firestorm. Mainstream-media content plays a major role in shaping discourse about events such as the refugee crisis, while social media’s participatory affordances allow for the narratives to be perpetuated, challenged, and injected with new perspectives. In this study, the perspectives and narratives of the refugee crisis from the mainstream news and Twitter-in the days following Aylan’s death-are compared and contrasted. Themes are extracted through topic modeling (LDA) and they reveal how news and Twitter converge and also diverge. We show that in the initial stages of a crisis and following the tragic death of Aylan, public discussion on Twitter was highly positive. Unlike the mainstream-media, Twitter offered an alternative and multifaceted narrative, not bound by geo-politics, raising awareness and calling for solidarity and empathy towards those affected. This study demonstrates how mainstream and social media form a new and complementary media space, where narratives are created and transformed. © 2019 by the authors.","Mainstream-media; Narratives; Networks; Refugee crisis; Social media; Twitter",,,,,,,,,,"An, J., Gummadi, K.P., Crowcroft, J., Quercia, D., Visualizing media bias through Twitter (2012) Proceedings of the ICWSM, pp. 2-5. , Palo Alto, CA: AAAI; Augoustinos, M., Social categorization: Towards theoretical integration (2001) Representations of the social, pp. 201-216. , K.

However, a well-established view of the concept draws from underpinning migration and refugee theories, in which integration is seen as a dynamic, multidimensional, and two-way process of adaptation to a new culture and that takes place over time. Most studies have focused on the integration perspective of host societies, in particular how governments’ understandings of belonging shape legal frameworks of rights and citizenship and their impact on the process of integration itself. With a focus on refugee migration to the Netherlands, this study analyzes the newcomers’ perspectives and experiences of integration and information in the host society, as well as the role of digital media technologies and networks in mediating this relationship. Building on policies and refugee migrant interviews, the article sketches out the ongoing dynamics of social capital during refugees’ adaptation processes in the country and puts forward a perception of the role of media in the integration act. © 2019 by the authors.","Digital technologies; Information practices; Refugee integration; Social capital",,,,,,,,,,"Ager, A., Strang, A., Understanding integration: A conceptual framework (2008) Journal of Refugee Studies, 21, pp. 166-191. , https://doi.org/10.1093/jrs/fen016; Alencar, A., Refugee integration and social media: A local and experiential perspective (2018) Information, Communication & Society, 21 (11), pp. 1588-1603; Alesina, A., La Ferrara, E., Ethnic diversity and economic performance (2005) Journal of Economic Literature, 43 (3), pp. 762-800; Andrade, A.D., Doolin, B., Information and communication technology and the social inclusion of refugees (2016) Mis Quarterly, 40 (2), pp. 405-416; Carrera, S., (2006) The nexus between immigration, integration and citizenship in the EU., , Brussels: Centre for European Policy Studies; Berry, J.W., Acculturation: Living successfully in two cultures (2005) International Journal of Intercultural Relations, 29 (6), pp. 697-712; Bobo, L.D., Tuan, M., Prejudice in Politics: Group position, public opinion, and the Wisconsin treaty rights dispute (2006) Social Forces, 86 (1), pp. 364-366; Bourdieu, P., Economic capital, cultural capital, social capital (1983) Soziale Ungleichheiten [Social inequalities], pp. 183-198. , R.

This connection provides a basis for resettled refugees to interact with their transnational networks and engage in political activities in novel ways. This article presents a digital ethnography with 15 resettled refugees living in New Zealand and the role of social media and transnational networks for the maintenance and creation of political lives. Taking a broad interpretation of how political and political life are understood, this article focuses on how power is achieved and leveraged to provide legitimacy and control. In particular, it examines how refugees practise transnational politics through social media as they navigate both the subjugation and subversion of power. These digital interactions have the potential to reconfigure and, at times collapse, the distance between the resettled “here” and the transnational “there”. This article highlights how social media facilitates political lives as an ongoing transnational phenomenon and its implications for the country of resettlement and the wider diaspora. © 2019 by the authors.","Digital communication; Forced migration; Politics; Refugee; Resettlement; Social media",,,,,,"Royal Society: 3708459","This research was supported by the Royal Society New Zealand under a Marsden Fast Start grant, ID# 3708459.",,,"Adan, T., De Casanova, J.-T.A., El-Helou, Z., Mannix, E., Mpeiwa, M., Opon, C.O., Zakaryan, T., (2018) Political participation of refugees: Bridging the gaps., , http://www.bosch-stiftung.de/sites/default/files/publications/pdf/2018-04/Political-participation-ofrefugees-bridging-the-gaps.pdf, Stockholm: International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance.

Yet one characteristic they all have in common is the place where they currently live. In addition, both groups are active users of social media, especially the young. Social media provide platforms to construct and negotiate one’s identity-particularly the identity related to where one lives: urban identity. This article presents the results of a survey study (N =324) investigating the relationships between social media engagement and identity construction among migrant and non-migrant adolescents in the super-diverse city of Rotterdam, the Netherlands. It was found that urban identity was significantly higher for migrants than non-migrants. Certain aspects of social media engagement predicted urban identity in combination with social identity. Finally, social media engagement was found to be positively related to group self-esteem. © 2019 by the authors.","Adolescents; Identity construction; Migration; Rotterdam; Self-esteem; Social media; Super-diversity; Urban identity",,,,,,,,,,"Alencar, A., Refugee integration and social media: A local and experiential perspective (2018) Information, Communication and Society, 21 (11), pp. 1588-1603. , https://doi.org/10.1080/1369118X.2017.1340500; Anderson, M., Jiang, J., Teens, social media & technology 2018 (2018) Pew Research Center., , https://www.pewinternet.org/2018/05/31/teens-social-media-technology-2018, Retrieved from; Barker, V., Older adolescents’ motivations for social network site use: The influence of gender, group identity, and collective self-esteem (2009) CyberPsychology & Behavior, 12 (2), pp. 209-213. , https://doi.org/10.1089/cpb.2008.0228; Boyd, D., (2014) It’s complicated: The social lives of networked teens., , New Haven, CT: Yale University Press; Boyd, D., Ellison, N.B., Social network sites: Definition, history, and scholarship (2007) Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication, 13 (1), pp. 210-230. , https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1083-6101.2007.00393.x; Brake, D.R., Are we all online content creators now?

Citizenship islands are based on the idea of “nonplaces” for noncitizens who are both constantly present and invisible. Citizenship islands are a test of what is to come, as noncitizens such as migrants and refugees continue to arrive, even as countries refuse their right of entry and of seeking asylum. Based on research in Lampedusa, I argue that as understandings of citizenship change, the ongoing emergency in the Mediterranean Sea forces a focus on noncitizens. What is happening around discourses of citizenship, mobility, and migration requires new language to describe and analyze what is already happening, and to theorize new research tools for the future. Nonplaces invite a paradox between visibility and invisibility, between in-dependence and inter-dependence, highlighting the importance of language in characterizing the experience of migrants and refugees and how that language shapes relationships between newcomers/noncitizens and already established residents/citizens. © 2019 by the authors.","Citizenship; Mediterranean sea; Migrants; Mobility; Noncitizens; Nonplaces; Refugees",,,,,,"IRB00022431

Through an analysis of archival material emerging from refugee camps in Germany between 1945 and 2000, roles and functions of media practices in the camp experience among forced migrants are demonstrated. The refugee camp is conceptualized as a heterotopian space, where media practices took place in pre-digital media environments. The archival records show how media practices of refugees responded to the spatial constraints of the camp. At the same time, media practices emerged from the precarious power relations between refugees, administration, and activists. Opportunities, spaces, and access to media practices and technologies were provided, yet at the same time restricted, by the camp structure and administration, as well as created by refugees and volunteers. Media activist practices, such as the voicing of demands for the availability of media, demonstrate how access to media was fought for within the power structures and affordances of the analogue environment. While basic media infrastructure had to be fought for more than in the digital era and surveillance and control of media practices was more intense, the basic need for access to information and connectivity was similar in pre-digital times, resulting in media activism. This exploration of unconsidered technological environments in media and refugee studies can arguably nuance our understanding of the role of media technologies in “refugee crises”. © 2019 by the authors.","Communication history; Forced migration; Germany; Media activism; Media practices; Refugee camp",,,,,,,,,,"Alencar, A., Refugee integration and social media: A local and experiential perspective (2018) Information Communication and Society, 21 (11), pp. 1588-1603; (1996) Flüchtlingsleben, Beispiel Lübeck [Refugee life, example Lübeck]., , 04.210).

Next to pre- and post-tests, four buddies reflected on the process via weekly media diaries. We found that higher peer-loneliness and lower self-esteem was reported for peers in the beginning but these differences disappeared. These results were confirmed by buddies’ media diaries: language and communication barriers reduced and friendships between buddies and peers grew. Buddies also reported high feelings of responsibilities in their media diaries which led to worries about their peer, but also to pride due to peers’ improvement. Online communication was used on an almost daily basis to stay in contact each other. Snapchat was found to influence emotional and affectionate support. In sum, Peer2Peer as a program showed positive effects for both sides. Future Peer2Peer programs should include trainings on social media as well, as most apps are able to be used independent of own language skills. Thus, social media can help to overcome language barriers and intensifies the feeling of being supported. © 2019 by the authors.","Adolescents; Peer coaching; Refugees; Social inclusion; Social media; Well-being",,,,,,,,,,"Ager, A., Strang, A., Understanding integration: A conceptual framework (2008) Journal of Refugee Studies, 21 (2), pp. 166-191. , http://doi.org/10.1038/tpj.2011.14; Alencar, A., Kondova, K., Ribbens, W., The smartphone as a lifeline: An exploration of refugees’ use of mobile communication technologies during their flight (2018) Media, Culture and Society, p. 2018. , http://doi.org/10.1177/0163443718813486; Anderson, M., Jiang, J., Teens, social media & technology 2018 (2018) Pew Research Center., , https://www.pewinternet.org/2018/05/31/teens-social-media-technology-2018, Retrieved from; Berg, M., Düvel, C., Qualitative media diaries: An instrument for doing research from a mobile media ethnographic perspective (2012) Interactions: Studies in Communication & Culture, 3 (1), pp. 71-89. , http://doi.org/10.1386/iscc.3.1.71; Bierwiaczonek, K., Waldzus, S., Socio-cultural factors as antecedents of cross-cultural adaptation in expatriates, international students, and migrants: A review (2016) Journal of Cross-Cultural Psychology, 47 (6), pp. 767-817. , http://doi.org/10.1177/0022022116644526; Bradshaw, J., Keung, A., Rees, G., Goswami, H., Children’s subjective well-being: International comparative perspectives (2011) Children and Youth Services Review, 33 (4), pp. 548-556. , http://doi.org/10.1016/j.childyouth.2010.05.010; Braun, V., Clarke, V., Using thematic analysis in psychology (2006) Qualitative Research in Psychology, 3 (2), pp. 77-101. , http://doi.org/10.1191/1478088706qp063oa; Buote, V.M., Wood, E., Pratt, M., Exploring similarities and differences between online and offline friendships: The role of attachment style (2009) Computers in Human Behavior, 25 (2), pp. 560-567. , http://doi.org/10.1016/j.chb.2008.12.022; Cialdini, R.B., Brown, S.L., Lewis, B.P., Luce, C., Neuberg, S.L., Reinterpreting the empathyaltruism relationship: When one into one equals oneness (1997) Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 73 (3), pp. 481-494. , http://doi.org/10.1037/0022-3514.73.3.481; Crick, N.R., Ladd, G.W., Children’s perception of their peer experiences: Attributions, loneliness, social anxiety, and social avoidance (1993) Developmental Psychologypmental Psychology, 29 (2), pp. 244-254; Dahya, N., Dryden-Peterson, S., Douhaibi, D., Arvisais, O., Dahya, N., Dryden-Peterson, S., Arvisais, O., Social support networks, instant messaging, and gender equity in refugee education (2019) Information, Communication & Society, 22 (6), pp. 774-790. , http://doi.org/10.1080/1369118X.2019.1575447; Díaz Andrade, A., Doolin, B., Information and communication technology and the social inclusion of refugees (2017) MIS Quarterly, 40 (2), pp. 405-416. , http://doi.org/10.25300/misq/2016/40.2.06; Fattore, T., Mason, J., Watson, E., Children’s conceptualisation(s) of their well-being (2007) Social Indicators Research, 80 (1), pp. 5-29. , http://doi.org/10.1007/s11205-006-9019-9; (2015) America’s children: Key national indicators of well-being, 2015., , https://www.childstats.gov/pdf/ac2015/ac_15.pdf, Washington, DC: U.S. Government Printing Office.

This is even more important when it comes to unaccompanied refugee children, whose voice is seldom heard. In this article the author builds upon her project of exploring unaccompanied refugee children’s lived media experiences and argues that-in order to have meaningful results and to create safe spaces for those who need it most-we need to search beyond traditional research tools. Specifically, she proposes to bring into research the concept of “play”. The article presents the use of bespoke, artisanal board games in cross-national interview settings with unaccompanied refugee children. It is argued that these creative tools can help in collecting diverse and rich data that can successfully complement traditional research methods. © 2019 by the authors.","Board games; Interviewing; Media literacy; Qualitative methods; Unaccompanied refugee children",,,,,,"747083

In the past few decades, technological advances have been shifting how information is produced, communicated, and interpreted. The Internet and digital environments have afforded a broader range of opportunities for literacy practices to take place. Technology has transformed the social practices and definitions of literacy, which leads to transformative implications for the teaching and learning environments facing ELLs. Despite immigrants’ attraction to the US, the tension between the public school system and emergent bilingual students has garnered broad attention. There is a need for a more appropriate teaching pedagogy that embraces the cultural identities of ELLs, and empowers ELLs as critical consumers and producers of information. Though complex, the authors advocate for examining this issue using an asset perspective rather than a deficit lens. Using the sociocultural perspective of learning and critical theory, this paper aims to define and conceptualize ELL learning, establish a shared vision of digital literacies, and review the literature on how practices of digital literacies empower ELLs to become active learners. In the final section, implications and future research directions are articulated in order to move the digital literacy field forward. © 2019 by the authors; licensee Cogitatio (Lisbon, Portugal).","Critical theory; Digital divide; Digital literacies; English language learners",,,,,,,,,,"Al-Jarf, R., Effect of online learning on struggling ESL college writers (2002) Foreign Language Annals, 37 (1), pp. 46-56; Al-Qallaf, C.L., Al-Mutairi, A.S.R., Digital literacy and digital content supports learning: The impact of blogs on teaching English as a foreign language (2016) The Electronic Library, 34 (3), pp. 522-547. , https://doi.org/10.1108/EL-05-2015-0076; Alexander, B., Becker, S.A., Cummins, M., Giesinger, C.H., (2017) Digital Literacy in Higher Education, Part Ii: An NMC Horizon Project Strategic Brief, 3 (4), pp. 1-37. , https://www.learntechlib.org/p/182086, Austin, TX: The New Media Consortium.

This article contributes to a notion of digital literacies as agentic and transformative and having epistemological implications. Although studies in digital literacies have examined diverse forms of understanding and relating to digitalization, we find that few studies have adopted a principled approach to transformative enactment of digital literacies. Our analytic focus is on how agents turn to digital (and other) resources when faced with problems in order to make them manageable. We conceptualize this notion of digital literacies by drawing on the Vygotskian principle of double stimulation. To demonstrate how agentic and transformative literacies appear in technology-rich learning environments, we make use of an empirical setting in which lower secondary school students and their teacher face a conundrum in a science project. We use this case as an empirical carrier of the conceptual and analytical framework employed. The analysis shows how the teacher enacts digital literacies in the design and orchestration of student activities in technology-rich learning environments where unforeseen issues occur, and how the collaborating students enact digital literacies by drawing on resources that enable them to resolve their insufficient understanding of a problem to reach insights that are shared with their peers. © 2019 by the authors; licensee Cogitatio (Lisbon, Portugal).","Agency; Digital literacies; Double stimulation; Education; Transformation",,,,,,,"The empirical case is based on data from the Ark&App project funded by the Norwegian Directorate for Education and Training, and the Department of Teacher Education and School Research, University of Oslo.",,,"Aesaert, K., Vanderlinde, R., Tondeur, J., van Braak, J., The content of educational technology curricula: A cross-curricular state of the art (2013) Educa-Tional Technology Research and Development, 61 (1), pp. 131-151; Andrews, B., McDougall, J., Curation pedagogy for media studies: (Further) towards the inexpert (2012) Medijske Studije/Media Studies, 3 (6), pp. 152-166; (1998) How Learning is Changing: Information and Communications Technology across Europe.

The issue hosts fourteen articles divided into four themes that address digital literacies in varying ways. The four themes are (a) defining digital literacies, (b) socio-cultural theories of digital literacies, (c) digital literacies in practice, and (d) digital skills and efficacy. The articles make a strong case for the continued exploration of the significance and (re)definition of digital literacies within our global communicative landscape. The authors have inspired new dialogue, research directions, innovative practices, and policy on digital literacies.

In response, digital literacy frameworks for formal education usually include a set of protective skills. Considering that teachers have the responsibility to implement such frameworks, this study investigates factors associated with teachers’ practices of fostering students’ digital protective skills. Therefore, data from a survey conducted with 315 teachers in the state of Thuringia, Germany, was analyzed. The findings indicate positive associations between the importance teachers attribute to digital protective skills, the knowledge they have about guidelines for media education, their formal media training, and their media and technology use in class. Besides, the analysis revealed associations with school type, subject taught, and teacher age. Conversely, the factors of human and technological resources did not yield significant effects in the regression model. The final model explained 48% of the variance in the teachers’ practices of fostering protective skills. © 2019 by the authors.","Digital literacy; Digital skills; Media education; Online risk; Protection of the private sphere; Protective skills; Teaching",,,,,,"Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG

Whilst digital youth work projects have become prominent in Europe in recent years, it has also become increasingly difficult to examine, capture, and understand their social impact. Currently, there is limited understanding of and research on how to measure the social impact of collaborative digital literacy youth projects. This article presents empirical research which explores the ways digital youth workers perceive and evaluate the social impact of their work. Twenty semi-structured interviews were carried out in Scotland, United Kingdom, in 2017. All data were coded in NVivo 10 and analysed using thematic data analysis (Braun & Clarke, 2006). Two problems were identified in this study: (1) limited critical engagement with the social impact evaluation process of digital youth work projects and its outcomes, and (2) lack of consistent definition of the evaluation process to measure the social impact/value of digital youth work. Results of the study are examined within a wider scholarly discourse on the evaluation of youth digital participation, digital literacy, and social impact. It is argued that to progressively work towards a deeper understanding of the social value (positive and negative) of digital youth engagement and their digital literacy needs, further research and youth worker evaluation training are required. Recommendations towards these future changes in practice are also addressed. © 2019 by the authors; licensee Cogitatio (Lisbon, Portugal).","Adolescents; Digital literacy; Digital youth work; Evaluation; Social impact",,,,,,"Edinburgh Napier University","This research was funded by Edinburgh Napier University.

Analyzing this relationship is important because social networks like Instagram can be used as platforms to promote one’s nutritional behavior as expression of personality and to interact with others. Countless meal images are posted, and reach a large number of users. With its visual characteristics, Instagram seems predestined for nutrition-related self-representation. Media literacy, one way of raising young people’s awareness of the risks of media use, encompasses the skills knowledge, evaluation, and action. If media literacy is transferred to the field of health communication, intersections become apparent. Media literacy is understood as a necessary ability to distinguish credible health information from non-credible health information. Both media and health literacy include the skills knowledge, evaluation, and action. Based on 15 qualitative interviews with girls in the age of 13 to 19, results show the relevance of media and health literacy for nutritional behavior. The girls own background information to classify and evaluate received content. They know that content on Instagram is staged and they reflect about negative effects of staged images. However, these images inspire them for their self-representation and nutritional behavior. They adapt what they see into their own eating habits, adopt trends, and thus act against their knowledge of negative consequences to reach the socially expected body image. © 2019 by the authors; licensee Cogitatio (Lisbon, Portugal).","Health literacy; Instagram; Media literacy; Nutritional behavior; Self-representation",,,,,,,,,,"Arnett, J.J., Adolescents’ use of media for self-socialization (1995) Journal of Youth and Adolescence, 24 (5), pp. 519-533; Arnett, J.J., Broad and narrow socialization: The family in the context of a cultural theory (1995) Journal of Marriage and the Family, 57 (3), pp. 617-628; Arnett, J.J., Socialization in emerging adulthood (2007) Socialization.

This critical review of the designs, impacts and markers of quality of six literacies interventions offers new insights into the strengths and weaknesses of fixed and open approaches to literacies learning in contexts of development. Open interventions offered greater promise for learning a range of digital literacies practices than fixed interventions, even though fixed interventions, based on mobile and web-based apps were inherently digital. This raises important questions about the ways literacies have been conceptualised in development research. © 2019 by the author; licensee Cogitatio (Lisbon, Portugal).","Development; Digital learning; Digital literacies; SDG4; Sustainable Development Goals; Universal quality education",,,,,,,,,,"Design, A.B., (2018) The Framework for Maker-Centred Learning, , http://www.agencybydesign.org/explore-the-framework, Retrieved from; Bekker, T., Bakker, S., Douma, I., van der Poel, J., Schel-Tenaar, K., Teaching children digital literacy through design-based learning with digital toolkits in schools (2015) International Journal of Child-Computer Interaction, 5, pp. 29-38. , https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijcci.2015.12.001; Braun, V., Clarke, V., Using thematic analysis in psychology (2006) Qualitative Research in Psychol-Ogy, 3, pp. 77-101. , https://doi.org/10.1191/1478088706qp063oa; Britt, A., Rouet, J.-F., Durik, A., (2018) Representations and Processes in Multiple Source Use, pp. 17-33. , J.

This article extends extant digital literacy studies by focusing on its subfield of digital citizenship. Proposing that digital citizenship is not another dimension or axis of citizenship, but a practice through which civic activities in the various dimensions of citizenship are conducted, this article critically considers how the concept of digital citizenship can furnish further insight into the quality of online civic participation that results in claims to and acts of citizenship. Through interdisciplinary scholarship, drawing from critical media and cultural theory, and media psychology, and deriving new empirical data from qualitative digital ethnography and quantitative focus group and survey studies, it presents original case studies with young people in Southeast Asia, including young Muslim women’s groups in Indonesia and youth public opinion on LGBTs in Singapore. It argues that Southeast Asian youth digital citizenship foregrounds civic participation as emergent acts that not only serve to make society a better place, but also enacts alternative publics that characterise new modes of civic-making in more conservative, collectivistic Southeast Asian societies. © 2019 by the authors; licensee Cogitatio (Lisbon, Portugal).","Digital citizenship; Digital literacy; Indonesia; Online civic participation; Singapore; Southeast Asia",,,,,,,,,,"Abidin, C., Aren’t these just young, rich women doing vain things online?

This article explores two of these practices, information literacy and media literacy and through an examination of their histories and practices proposes a future direction for digital literacy. The article consists of three main sections. Section one considers the history of information literacy. The gradual development and refinement of information literacy is traced through a number of key texts and proclamations. Section two is concerned with media literacy. It is noted that media literacy education evolved in three broad strands with each pursuing differing political ends and utilising different techniques. The three approaches are still evident and differences in contemporary media education practices can be understood through this framework. The final section argues that while media and information literacy offer much there are deficiencies in both: media literacy lacks a full engagement with the nature of digital technology and how digital technology affords users new communicative practices while information literacy has not fully developed a critical approach in the way media literacy has. It is asserted that integrating and strategically revisiting both approaches offers a digitally aware and critically nuanced direction for digital literacy. © 2019 by the author; licensee Cogitatio (Lisbon, Portugal).","Critical digital literacy; Digital literacy; History; Information literacy; Media literacy",,,,,,,,,,"(1989) American Library Association Presidential Committee on Information Literacy: Final Report, , Washington, DC: American Library Association; Arnold, M., (1869) Culture and Anarchy: An Essay in Political and Social Criticism, , London: Smith, Elder & Company; Aufderheide, P., (1993) Media Literacy. a Report of the Na-Tional Leadership Conference on Media Literacy., , Washington, DC: ERIC; Barthes, R., Lavers, A., (1972) Mythologies, , New York, NY: Hill and Wang; Batool, S., Webber, S., Early findings from a study of information literacy practices in primary schools of pakistan (2014) Informa-Tion Literacy.

However, little work has explored the possibility of an approach that would demonstrate how different perspectives on literacies might intersect and interconnect in order to better describe the multifaceted nature of youth digital literacies. In this conceptual article, we adopt the idea of theoretical triangulation in interpretive inquiry and explore how multiple perspectives can jointly contribute to constructing a nuanced description of young people’s literacies in today’s digitally mediated global world. For this purpose, we first suggest a triangulation framework that integrates sociocultural, affective, and cognitive perspectives on digital literacies, focusing on recent developments in these perspectives. We then use an example of discourse data from a globally connected online affinity space and demonstrate how our multidimensional framework can lead to a complex analysis and interpretation of the data. In particular, we describe the substance of one specific case of youth digital literacies from each of the three perspectives on literacy, which in turn converge to provide a complex account of such literacy practices. In conclusion, we discuss the promise and limitations of our integrative approach to studying the digital literacy practices of youth. © 2019 by the authors; licensee Cogitatio (Lisbon, Portugal).","Border-Crossing Discourse; Digital literacies; Epistemic cognition; Self-determination theory; Theoretical triangulation; Youth digital literacies",,,,,,,,,,"Afflerbach, P., Cho, B.-Y., Identifying and describing constructively responsive comprehension strategies in new and traditional forms of reading (2009) Handbook of Research on Reading Comprehension, pp. 69-90. , S.

While contemporary uses of digital literacy are broadly associated with access, evaluation, curation, and production of information in digital environments, we trace the concept’s genealogy to a time before this tentative agreement was reached—when diverse scholarly lineages (e.g., computer literacy, information literacy, media literacy) were competing to shape the educational agenda for emerging communication technologies. Using assemblage theory, we map those meanings that have persisted in our present articulations of digital literacy, as well as those that were abandoned along the way. We demonstrate that our inherited conceptions of digital literacy have prioritized the interplay of users, devices, and content over earlier concerns about technical infrastructures and socio-economic relations. This legacy, we argue, contributes to digital literacy’s inadequacies in addressing contemporary dilemmas related to surveillance, control, and profit motives in connective environments. We propose a multidimensional framework for understanding digital literacies that works to reintegrate some of these earlier concerns and conclude by considering how such an orientation might open pathways for education research and practice. © 2019 by the authors; licensee Cogitatio (Lisbon, Portugal).","Digital literacy; Information literacy; Literacies; Media literacy; New literacies",,,,,,,,,,"Association, A.L., Presidential commission on information literacy (1989) Coping with Information Il-Literacy: Bibliographic Instruction for the Information Age, pp. 156-171. , G.

Self-efficacy, more than the actual performance, influences the will to try again and not give up. Few studies are available on how narrative self-efficacy affects expressive development, especially in school contexts characterized by multilingualism and multiculturalism. This exploratory survey aims to investigate the narrative self-efficacy of eighteen 8-year-old children attending primary school, with a significant presence of international migrant children (two out of three). For three months, these students were involved in multimodal narrative learning activities through gestural/mime languages (theatre), visual languages (drawings), verbal languages (oral and written) and digital languages (digital video narration). The research questions were: (1) Does the multimodal workshop influence the self-efficacy beliefs of the narrative skills perceived by Italian students (L1) and international migrant students (L2)? (2) Does the most influence come from the mime/gestural, the digital video or the entire multimodal narrative activities? (3) In which aspects of the narrative is the self-efficacy most influenced by the multimodal workshop for L1 and L2 groups?. © 2019 by the authors; licensee Cogitatio (Lisbon, Portugal).","International migrant students; Multicultural; Multilingualism; Multiliteracies; Multimodality; Narrative skills; Primary school; Self-efficacy",,,,,,"European Commission, EC: 570754-CREA-1-2016-1-IT-CULT-COOP1","This work is supported by EU project SHABEGH (CREATIVE EUROPE—CULTURE) (Project Reference: 570754-CREA-1-2016-1-IT-CULT-COOP1).

In 2006, the European Union defined digital competence as one of eight key competences for lifelong learning. The terms digital literacies and digital competence have since been used interchangeably, particularly in policy documents concerning education and the digitalization of educational systems and teaching. However, whether these concepts carry similar meanings, and are understood in a similar way, across languages and cultures is not self-evident. By taking the curricula in Sweden, Denmark, Finland, and Norway as examples, this article attempts to clarify similarities and differences in how the concepts are interpreted, as well as what implications this has for the digitalization of education. The analyses reveal that different terms are used in the curricula in the different countries, which are connected to themes or interdisciplinary issues to be incorporated into school subjects. The conceptualizations of the terms share a common emphasis on societal issues and a critical approach, highlighting a particular Nordic interpretation of digital literacies and digital competence. © 2019 by the author; licensee Cogitatio (Lisbon, Portugal).","Bildung; Curricula; Digital competence; Digital literacies; Education; Literacy",,,,,,,"I would like to thank Sylvana Sofkova Hashemi and Petra Magnusson for ideas and inspiration in connection with the analysis of the Swedish curriculum and work that we have done together previously.

This includes the skills, knowledge, and dispositions that lead to ability to critique and create digital texts that interrogate the self, the other, and the world (Ávila & Zacher Pandya, 2013). Video making holds out enormous potential given our increasingly diverse classrooms and the growing need to have students connect and collaborate within their own communities and globally (Dwyer, 2016; Ontario Ministry of Education, 2015, 2016; Spires, Paul, Himes, & Yuan, 2018; Watt, 2017, 2018; Watt, Abdulqadir, Siyad, & Hujaleh, 2019). Video is especially significant in light of the fact that it is replacing print text as a dominant mode of communication (Manjou, 2018). Multimodal composing such as video production is, in fact, considered by some to be the essential 21st century literacy (Miller & McVee, 2012), but much remains to be done to bring digital technologies as literacy into the elementary classroom. Qualitative data includes a focus group, questionnaires, observations, and content analysis of teacher candidate videos and instructional plans. This study considers how video production can be integrated into teacher education programs to engage cross-curricular expectations and critical digital literacy perspectives. It responds to the pressing question of how to do teacher education differently in the digital age. © 2019 by the author; licensee Cogitatio (Lisbon, Portugal).","Critical digital literacy; Curriculum integration; New Literacies; Teacher education; Technology; Video production",,,,,,"Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada, SSHRC","Funding for this research has been provided by the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada through an Insight Development Grant.

All of these factors increase the probability of health decisions linked with poor outcomes that include higher levels of cancer mortality. Persistent discrimination against, and stigmatization of, LGBQ/T people is reflected in sparse medical curriculum addressing LGBQ/T communities. Marginalization makes LGBQ/T persons particularly reliant on knowledge derived from online networks and mainstream media sources. In what is likely the first nationally-funded and nation-wide study of LGBQ/T experiences of cancer, the Cancer’s Margins project (www.lgbtcancer.ca) conducted face-to-face interviews with 81 sexual and/or gender minority patients diagnosed and treated for breast and/or gynecological cancer in five Canadian provinces and the San Francisco Bay area (US). With specific attention to knowledge access, sharing, and mobilization, our objective was to document and analyse complex intersectional relationships between marginalization, gender and sexuality, and cancer health decision-making- and care experiences. Findings indicate that cancer care knowledge in online environments is shaped by cisnormative and heteronormative narratives. Cancer knowledge and support environments need, by contrast, to be designed by taking into account intersectionally diverse models of minority identities and communities. © 2019, Cogitatio Press.

In Hong Kong, mobile chat apps have served as tools for foreign correspondents to follow stories, identify sources, and verify facts; they have also helped reporting teams manage large flows of multimedia information in real-time. To understand the institutional, technological, and cultural factors at play, this article draws on 34 interviews the author conducted with journalists who use mobile chat apps in their reporting. Building on the concept of media logic, the article explores technology-involved social interactions and their impact on media work, while acknowledging the agency of users and audiences within a cultural context. It argues that mobile chat apps have become hosts for a logic of connectedness and insularity in media work, and this has led to new forms of co-production in journalism. © 2019 by the author.","Chat apps; Hong Kong; Journalism; Media logic; Mobile communication",,,,,,,,,,"Agur, C., Frisch, N., Digital disobedience and the limits of persuasion: Social media activism in Hong Kong’s 2014 Umbrella Movement Social Media + Society, , in press; Altheide, D.L., Media logic and social interaction (1987) Symbolic Interaction, 10 (1), pp. 129-138. , https://doi.org/10.1525/si.1987.10.1.129; Altheide, D.L., Media logic and political communication (2004) Political Communication, 21 (3), pp. 293-296. , https://doi.org/10.1080/10584600490481307; Altheide, D.L., Snow, R.P., (1979) Media Logic, , Beverly Hills, CA: Sage; Altheide, D.L., Snow, R.P., (1991) Media Worlds in the Postjournalism Era, , New York, NY: Aldine de Gruyter; Barot, T., Guide to chat apps (2015) Columbia Journalism Review, , http://www.cjr.org/tow_center_reports/guide_to_chat_apps.php, Retrieved from; Barot, T., Instant messaging: BBC News on chat apps (2017) BBC Academy, , https://www.bbc.co.uk/academy/en/articles/art20150408142840687, Retrieved from; Belair-Gagnon, V., Agur, C., Frisch, N., (2016) New Fron-Tiers in Newsgathering: A Case Study of Foreign Cor-Respondents Using Chat Apps to Cover Political Un-Rest, , https://academiccommons.columbia.edu/doi/10.7916/D8FN1JGW, New York, NY: Tow Center for Digital Journalism; Belair-Gagnon, V., Agur, C., Frisch, N., The changing physical and social environment of newsgathering: A case study of foreign correspondents using chat apps during unrest (2017) Social Media + Society, 3 (1). , https://doi.org/10.1177/2056305117701163; Belair-Gagnon, V., Agur, C., Frisch, N., Mobile sourcing: Trust in journalistic sourcing on mobile chat apps (2017) Mobile Media and Communication, 6 (1). , https://doi.org/10.1177/2050157917725549; Belair-Gagnon, V., Mishra, S., Agur, C., Reconstructing the Indian public sphere: Newswork and social media during the Delhi gang rape case (2014) Jour-Nalism, 15 (8), pp. 1059-1075. , https://doi.org/10.1177/1464884913513430; Berglez, P., Inside, outside, and beyond media logic: Journalistic creativity in climate reporting (2011) Media, Culture & Society, 33 (3), pp. 449-465. , https://doi.org/10.1177/0163443710394903; Messaging apps for publishers report: Why chat apps are now crucial for publishers (2016) Business Insider Intelligence, , http://uk.businessinsider.com/heres-why-chat-apps-are-becoming-one-of-the-most-important-new-platforms-for-publishers-2016-6, Retrieved from; Brandts, K., van Praag, P., Beyond media logic (2017) Journalism Studies, 18 (4), pp. 395-408. , https://doi.org/10.1080/1461670X.2015.1065200; Chadwick, A., (2013) The Hybrid Media System: Politics and Power, , Oxford: Oxford University Press; Couldry, N., Hepp, A., (2016) The Mediated Construc-Tion of Reality, , London: Wiley; Dahlgren, P., Media logic in cyberspace: Repo-sitioning journalism and its publics (1996) Javnost-The Public, 3 (3), pp. 59-72. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13183222.1996.11008632; Deuze, M., The media logic of media work (2009) Journal of Media Sociology, 1 (2), pp. 22-40; Duffy, B., Pooley, J., “Facebook for academics”: The convergence of self-branding and social media logic on Academia.edu (2017) Social Media + Society, 3 (1), pp. 1-11. , https://doi.org/10.1177/2056305117696523; Klinger, U., Svensson, J., The emergence of network media logic in political communication: A theoretical approach (2015) New Media & Society, 17 (8), pp. 1241-1257; Lai, Y.-K., (2015) Hong Kong Legislative Council President Admits Whatsapp Chat during Reform Vote was Wrong.

On top of a wealth of audience data collected, algorithmic approaches can then be applied with an eye towards predicting and optimizing the performance of content based on historical patterns. This work focuses specifically on content optimization practices surrounding the use of A/B headline testing in newsrooms. Using such approaches, digital newsrooms might audience-test as many as a dozen headlines per article, collecting data that allows an optimization algorithm to converge on the headline that is best with respect to some metric, such as the click-through rate. This article presents the results of an interview study which illuminate the ways in which A/B testing algorithms are changing workflow and headline writing practices, as well as the social dynamics shaping this process and its implementation within US newsrooms. © 2019 by the authors.","Audience metrics; Content optimization; Digital media; Headline testing; Headlines",,,,,,"National Science Foundation, NSF: IIS-1717330","The authors thank our participants for sharing their valuable insight, without which this research would not have been possible.

We find that Swedes hold the most positive attitudes towards both groups, while the French are found to be most negative. The Belgians and Dutch hold moderate attitudes. There is also evidence that attitudes on refugees are more negative than attitudes on immigrants in Sweden and France, but not in Belgium and the Netherlands. Using structural equation modeling, we find that household composition is not directly related to attitudes, but indirect effects through socio-economic status and media consumption indicate that singles hold more negative attitudes than couples. Public television consumption, popular online news consumption, and trust in media are positively related to attitudes, whereas commercial television consumption is negatively associated with them. © 2019 by the authors.","Attitudes; Household composition; Immigrant; Media trust; News media consumption; Refugees; Socio-economic status",,,,,,"KU Leuven

Using more than 1,000 respondents from South Korea, the study empirically tested a theoretical model of FOI on political content consumption and expressions with two mediators (i.e., attention/status-seeking, and anonymity-seeking). Results indicated that FOI is related to seeking attention and status in political outlets also connected to anonymity-preference that leads to political expression. Implications for political communication scholarship and for practitioners are that voters’ political participations can be understood in a framework different from traditional focus on persuasion, political ideology, or demographics because—in today’s virtual and interactive media environment—users are more content consumers or community participants. © 2019 by the authors.","Anonymity-seeking; Attention-seeking; Fear of isolation; Political communication; Social media; Status-seeking",,,,,,,,,,"Bailenson, J.N., Yee, N., Merget, D., Schroeder, R., The effect of behavioral realism and form realism of real-time avatar faces on verbal disclosure, nonverbal disclosure, emotion recognition, and cop-resence in dyadic interaction (2006) Presence, 15, pp. 359-372; Bargh, J.A., McKenna, K.Y.A., Fitzsimons, G.M., Can you see the real me?

Specifically, it deals with children from the Maghreb, Ecuador, and Sub-Saharan Africa, three regions which account for a quarter of Spain’s foreign-born population. A qualitative methodology was used, based on in-depth interviews with 52 children from these countries and educators from their support centres. Immigrant minors usually access the Internet via their smartphones rather than via computers. They have a very high rate of smartphone use and access the Internet over public Wi-Fi networks. However, they make little use of computers and tablets, the devices most closely associated with education and accessing information. Internet usage is fairly similar among immigrant and Spanish teens, although the former receive more support and mediation from their schools and institutions than from their parents. The Internet helps them to communicate with their families in their countries of origin. As one educator puts it, “they have gone from sending photos in letters to speaking to their families every day on Skype”. Some teens, particularly Maghrebis, sometimes suffer from hate messages on social networks. © 2019 by the authors.","Children; Cyber-bullying; Immigrant; Internet; Media risks; Spain; Youth",,,,,,"Eusko Jaurlaritza

Parallel processes of coming-out, coming-of-age and migration are increasingly digitally mediated. Young adult gay migrants are “connected migrants”, using smartphones and social media to maintain bonding ties with contacts in their home country while establishing new bridging relationships with peers in their country of arrival (Diminescu, 2008). Drawing on the feminist perspective of intersectionality, socio-cultural categories like age, race, nationality, migration status, and gender and sexuality have an impact upon identification and subordination, thus we contend it is problematic to homogenize these experiences to all young adult gay migrants. The realities of settlement and integration starkly differ between those living on the margins of Europe—forced migrants including non-normative racialized young gay men—and voluntary migrants—such as elite expatriates including wealthy, white and Western young gay men. Drawing on 11 in-depth interviews conducted in Amsterdam, the Netherlands with young adult gay forced and voluntary migrants, this article aims to understand how sexual identification in tandem with bonding and bridging social capital diverge and converge between the two groups all while considering the interplay between the online and offline entanglements of their worlds. © 2019 by the authors.","Bonding social capital; Bridging social capital; Connected migrants; Digital diaspora; Digital migration studies; Forced migrants; Gay; Inter-ethnic social contact; Sexuality; Voluntary migrants",,,,,,"Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek, NWO","We are grateful to the informants for letting us into their lives.

That label of “locative media”, though, usually gets defined ad hoc and used in many different ways to express a variety of related ideas. Locative features of digital media increasingly have changed from visible location-driven aspects of user interfaces, such as check-in features and location badges, toward more inconspicuous ways of relating to location through automated backend processes. In turn, locative features—whether in journalism or other formats and content types—are now increasingly algorithmic and hidden “under the hood”, so to speak. Part of the problem with existing classifications or typologies in this field is that they do not take into account this practical shift and the rapid development of locative media in many new directions, intertwining ubiquitous digital integration with heterogeneous content distinctions and divergences. Existing definitions and typologies tend to be based on dated practices of use and initial versions of applications that have changed significantly since inception. To illustrate, this article identifies three emerging areas within digital journalism and mobile media practice that call for further research into the locative dimensions of journalism: the situational turn in news consumption research, platform-specific vis-a-vis platform-agnostic mobile news production, and personalised news. © 2019 by the authors.","Digital journalism; Locative media; Mobile journalism; Mobile media; Mobile news; Mobile technology; Place-based media",,,,,,"Norges ForskningsrÃ¥d","Ivar John Erdal (PhD) is an Associate Professor at the Faculty of Media and Journalism at Volda University College, and a visiting scholar at the Department of Media and Communication at the University of Sydney.

To test our “culture of corruption” hypothesis, which predicts that the English-language adaptation of telenovelas will “Americanize” their content by increasing risky and reducing healthy portrayal on screen, we coded the depictions of five risk variables and five culture of health ones in ten episodes each of “Juana la Virgen” (2002) and its popular English-language counterpart, “Jane the Virgin” (2014). A significant increase was found between the Spanish and English-language shows in the risk category of sexual content and a marginally significant increase was found in violence. “Jane” also had larger numbers of characters modeling alcohol consumption, sex, or violence. Across culture of health variables, “Juana” and “Jane” did not exhibit significant differences in the amounts of education-related content, social cohesion, and exercise at the episode level. However, “Jane” had significantly more unhealthy food content (specifically, fats, oils, and sweets and takeout food) and more pro-health messaging than did “Juana.” “Jane” also had a larger amount of modeled food/beverage consumption. While “Juana” modeled several instances of characters involved in exercise, “Jane” had no exercise content across the sample. Overall, “Jane” portrayed more problematic health content than “Juana.” The increase in worrisome content in “Jane” may adversely affect the health of adolescent Hispanics, who make up a large part of the show’s audience. © 2019 by the authors.","Adolescent; Content analysis; Health; Hispanic; Media; Risk; Telenovela; Television",,,,,,"Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, RWJF","The authors thank the Annenberg Public Policy Center (APPC) and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation’s (RWJF) Culture of Health (CoH) initiative for their financial support of the CHAMPION project.

A qualitative content analysis of a sample comprising 36 clips and episodes of 14 non-fiction programmes was supplemented by four focus group interviews with a total of 12 participants belonging to different ethnocultural minorities. The findings suggest that despite several measures undertaken by the VRT, the representation of ethnocultural minorities is still unbalanced and biased in at least three ways: first, in presenting minorities as homogeneous groups rather than highlighting intragroup differences; second, in ‘typecasting’ people with a migration background thematically, i.e., for items on topics and issues related to their ethnocultural identity; and, third, in portraying and approaching minorities from a dominant group perspective. The article ends with the recommendation for public service media to further improve ethnocultural diversity in the workforce and to encourage their journalists and TV producers to reconsider their ‘professional pragmatics’ in order to increase their ethnocultural sensitivity and better manage the representation of super-diversity in their programmes. © 2019 by the authors.","Ethnic minorities; Ethnocultural diversity; Media representation; Non-fiction programmes; Public service media; Super-diversity; Television",,,,,,"Universiteit Antwerpen","This study is part of a research project commissioned by the Flemish public service broadcaster VRT and indepen- dently carried out by the authors at the University of Antwerp.

As a result, distinct journalistic voices are forced to compete more directly with experts, commentators, sources, and other stakeholders within the same space. Such shifting power relations may be observed also in the interactions between political journalists and their audiences on major social media platforms. This article therefore pursues a cross-national comparison of interactions between political journalists and their audiences on Twitter in Germany and Australia, documenting how the differences in the status of Twitter in each country’s media environment manifest in activities and network interactions. In each country, we observed Twitter interactions around the national parliamentary press corps (the Bundespressekonferenz and the Federal Press Gallery), gathering all public tweets by and directed at the journalists’ accounts during 2017. We examine overall activity and engagement patterns and highlight significant differences between the two national groups; and we conduct further network analysis to examine the prevalent connections and engagement between press corps journalists themselves, and between journalists, their audiences, and other interlocutors on Twitter.

This groupthink attracted renewed criticism after the unexpected victory of Republican candidate Donald Trump in the 2016 US presidential election as the campaign coverage had indicated a likely win by the Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton. This pattern was repeated in the 2017 UK election when the Conservative party lost their majority after a campaign in which the news coverage had pointed to an overall Tory victory. Such groupthink is often attributed to homophily, the tendency of individuals to interact with those most like them, and while homophily in the legacy media system is well-studied, there is little research around homophily in the hybrid media system, even as social media platforms like Twitter facilitate the development—and analysis—of virtual political journalism packs. This study, which compares Twitter interactions among US and UK political reporters in the 2016 and 2017 national elections, shows that political journalists are overwhelmingly more likely to use Twitter to interact with other journalists, particularly political journalists, and that their offline tendencies to form homogenous networks have transferred online. There are some exceptions around factors such as gender, news organizations and types of news organization—and important distinctions between types of interactions—but overall the study provides evidence of sustained homophily as journalists continue to normalize Twitter. © 2019 by the author.","Elections; Groupthink; Homophily; Political journalism; Twitter; UK; US",,,,,,,,,,"Artwick, C.G., News sourcing and gender on Twitter (2013) Journalism, 15 (8), pp. 1111-1157; Ausserhofer, J., Maireder, A., National politics on Twitter (2013) Information, Communication & So-Ciety, 16 (3), pp. 291-314; Bentivegna, S., Marchetti, R., Journalists at a crossroads: Are traditional norms and practices challenged by Twitter?

The articles here examine these relationships as intersections between journalistic actors and their audiences, and between news media, their content, and the functions of social media platforms. As the articles in this issue show, the emergence of social media and their adoption by news media and other social actors have brought about a series of changes which have had an impact on how news is produced, how information is shared, how audiences consume news, and how publics are formed. In this introduction, we highlight the work in this issue in order to reflect on the emergence of social media as one which has been accompanied by shifts in power in journalism and its ancillary fields, shifts which have in turn surfaced new questions for scholars to confront. © 2019 by the authors. licensee Cogitatio (Lisbon, Portugal).","Journalism; News ecology; Normalization; Power; Social media",,,,,,,,,,"Beckers, K., Harder, R., “Twitter just exploded”: Social media as alternative vox pop (2016) Digital Journal-Ism, 4 (7), pp. 910-920; Bossio, D., (2017) Journalism and Social Media: Practi-Tioners, Organisations and Institutions, , Basingstoke: Palgrave Macmillan; Broersma, M., Situating journalism in the digital: A plea for studying news flows, users, and materiality (2019) The Routledge Handbook of Developments in Digital Journalism Stud-Ies, pp. 515-526. , S.

By focusing on one of the criteria, the current influence of elites on political debate, it discusses the Habermasian principles of general accessibility and non-dominance of the elites as prerequisites for a functioning public sphere. This study finds that even though there are few access restrictions on Twitter and despite the fact that no one, in principle, is excluded from the platform, there is no apparent elimination of privileges and the elites maintain their elite status within its borders. Methodologically, the article relies on empirical research of hashtagged exchanges on Twitter during the General Elections in the United Kingdom in 2015. Through the mapping of Twitter as a synthesis of dialogic arenas, it explores the elite-focused discourse and the vocal actors in the stream, underscoring that the presence of the elites, even in an indirect way. Drawing on these elements, the article argues for a reconceptualization of the normative perception of the public sphere, suggesting the notion of exclusion is a complex issue that includes expanding notions of publics to also include those topics being discussed. Finally, it focuses on the significance of journalism in relation to political dialogue and argues that the move towards less elite-centered arenas largely depends on journalism. © 2019 by the author.","Democracy; Digital public sphere(s); Elites; Habermas; Journalism; Political arenas; Twitter",,,,,,,,,,"Allen, A., The public sphere: Ideology and/or ideal?

In earlier times the role of mediating politics to publics often fell to news media, which were also dependent on constructing a ‘public’ for their own viability. It is hardly notable to say this has changed in a digital age, and in the way social media have allowed politicians and political movements to speak to their own publics bypassing news voices is a clear example of this. We show how both established politics and emerging political movements now activate and intensify certain publics through their media messages, and how this differs in the UK, Spain and the Netherlands. When considering journalism and social media, emphasis on their prominence can mask more complex shifts they ushered in, including cross-national differences, where they have pushed journalism towards social media to communicate news, and where political actors now use these spaces for their own communicative ends. Building upon this research, this article revisits conceptualizations of the ways political actors construct publics and argues that we see processes of disintermediation taking place in political actors’ social networks on Twitter. © 2019 by the authors.","Journalism; Networks; Politics; Public sphere; Publics; Social media; Twitter",,,,,,,,,,"Anderson, B., (1983) Imagined Communities, , London: Verso; Aragón, P., Gómez, V., García, D., Kaltenbrunner, A., Generative models of online discussion threads: State of the art and research challenges (2017) Journal of Internet Services and Applications, 8 (15), pp. 1-17. , https://doi.org/10.1186/s13174-017-0066-z; Atkin, R.H., (1977) Combinational Connectives in Social Systems, , Basel: Birkhanser; Batorski, D., Grzywińska, I., Three dimensions of the public sphere on Facebook (2018) Information, Com-Munication & Society, 21 (3), pp. 356-374; Bellotti, E., (2015) Qualitative Networks.

This boundary, often referred to in the West as a ‘Chinese Wall’, is designed to uphold the independence of journalists from commercial interests or the whims of news proprietors. But does this separation still exist in today’s age of social media and at a time when news revenues are under unprecedented pressure? This article focuses on Twitter, now a widely used tool in the newsroom, analysing the Twitter output of 10 UK political correspondents during the busy party conference season. It examines how they promote their own stories or ‘personal brand’ and whether they are stepping over a once forbidden line, blurring the boundary between news and the business. The research is complemented by interviews with political correspondents and analysis of editorial codes of practice on the use of social media. It draws on a conceptual framework of boundary work (Carlson & Lewis, 2015) to pose the question whether such practice has now become accepted and normalised. The findings suggest that the 10 political correspondents are highly individualistic in their use of Twitter but all have embraced its use to promote their own work plus that of colleagues both inside their own organisation and those working for rival news outlets. Their acceptance of Twitter as a tool for self-promotion and branding suggests that in this area of reporting the practice has become normalised and the wall has been breached. © 2019 by the author.","Boundary work; Business; Journalism; Social media; Twitter",,,,,,,,,,"Artemas, K., Vos, T.P., Duffy, M., Journalism hits a wall: Rhetorical construction of newspapers’ editorial and advertising relationship (2018) Journalism Studies, 19 (7), pp. 1004-1020; Barnard, S.R., ‘Tweet or be sacked’: Twitter and the new elements of journalistic practice (2016) Journalism, 17 (2), pp. 190-207; Barthel, M.L., Moon, R., Mari, W., Who retweets whom: How digital and legacy journalists interact on Twitter (2015) Tow Center for Digital Journalism, , http://towcenter.org/research/whoretweets-whom-how-digital-and-legacy-journalists-interact-on-twitter; (2015) Social Media Guidelines for Staff, , http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/bsp/hi/pdfs/26_03_15_bbc_news_group_social_media_guidance.pdf, Retrieved from; Editorial guidelines (2018) Social Networking, Mi-Croblogs and Other Third Party Websites.

Within these analyses, however, very little attention has been devoted towards exploring the transnational ideological circulation of Islamophobia and anti-establishment sentiment, especially amongst diaspora and migrant networks. This article thus explores the role of the Indian diaspora as mediators in populist radical right discourse in the West. During the Brexit referendum and Trump’s election and presidency, a number of Indian diaspora voices took to Twitter to express pro-Brexit and pro-Trump views. This article presents a year-long qualitative study of these users. It highlights how these diasporic Indians interact and engage on Twitter in order to signal belonging on multiple levels: as individuals, as an imaginary collective non-Muslim diaspora, and as members of (populist radical right) Twitter society. By analysing these users’ social media performativity, we obtain insight into how social media spaces may help construct ethnic and (trans)national identities according to boundaries of inclusion/exclusion. This article demonstrates how some Indian diaspora individuals are embedded into exclusivist national political agendas of the populist radical right in Western societies. © 2019 by the author.","Brexit; Diaspora; Indian; Integration; Multiculturalism; Populism; Radical right; Trump; Twitter",,,,,,,,,,"Ampofo, L., Anstead, N., O’Loughlin, B., Trust, confidence, and credibility: Citizen responses on Twitter to opinion polls during the 2010 UK general election (2011) Information, Communication & Society, 14 (6), pp. 850-871; Anderson, E., ‘Neo-Hindutva’: The Asia House M.

YouTube is an influential social media platform, reaching over a billion users worldwide. Its extensive reach attracts professional and amateur video producers who turn to YouTube to inform, entertain and engage global publics. Focusing on YouTube, this study explores the place for journalism within this media ecology. This study uses a mixed-method approach to examine forms of audience engagement to YouTube videos about antimicrobial resistance (AMR), or so called “superbugs”, caused by overuse and misuse of antibiotics. The analysis focuses on the most viewed YouTube videos about AMR between 2016 and 2018, and compares engagement themes expressed in comments to journalistic videos with popular science videos. The most viewed videos about AMR on YouTube are professionally produced educational popular science videos. The qualitative analysis of 3,049 comments identifies seven main forms of high-level engagement, including expressions of emotions, blame and calls for action. This study shows that journalism plays an important role on YouTube by generating audience discussions about social and political accountability. Our findings demonstrate that journalism videos were associated with propositions for political, economic and social/lifestyle actions, while popular science videos were associated with medicines, scientific or pseudo-scientific, and medical practice changes. © 2019 by the authors.","Antibiotic resistance; Antimicrobial resistance; Audience engagement; Popular science; Social media; Superbugs; User comments; Video journalism; YouTube",,,,,,"Australian Research Council, ARC: DP170100937","This research was supported by a Discovery Project grant from the Australian Research Council [grant number DP170100937] and by The Centre for Antibiotic Resistance Research (CARe) at University of Gothenburg, Sweden.

This study aimed to investigate the extent to which the representation of women changed over time in two Dutch-speaking Belgian newspapers De Standaard and Het Laatste Nieuws. An automated quantitative content analysis revealed that there is no increase of the number of women in the newspapers between 2005 and 2015. On the contrary, women are significantly less represented over time in the popular newspaper Het Laatste Nieuws. A qualitative analysis on two cases about women stepping into a leadership position— in 2012 (Catherine De Bolle as head of the Federal police) and in 2014 (Dominique Leroy as CEO of a Belgian telecom company)—showed that the press emphasised their femininity, their being a role model for other women, their being part of a family and having certain looks. Moreover, these women are clearly portrayed as ‘the best candidate’ pointing at the selection procedures and their capabilities to perform professionally. Probably, this strong emphasis is a way of justifying that these women are not selected because of positive discrimination. Further analysis of cases of both men and women stepping into top positions across countries and media platforms is recommended. © 2019 by the author; licensee Cogitatio (Lisbon, Portugal).","Content analysis; Dutch-speaking press; Gender; News; Representation; Stereotyping; Women",,,,,,"KU Leuven","I would like to thank the editors for giving me the opportunity to publish in this thematic issue.

The public communication of refugee organizations thereby increasingly impacts their operations, the public perception on forcibly displaced people and societal and policy beliefs and actions. However, little research has been conducted on the topic. Therefore, this conceptual article aims to (1) define refugee organizations’ public communication, (2) situate it within broader research fields, and (3) motivate the latter’s relevance as research perspectives. In order to be able to achieve these research objectives, the article first discusses the social and scientific relevance of the research subject and identifies important gaps within literature which both form an essential scientific base for developing the main arguments. Adopting a historical perspective, the article demonstrates that in recent decades the social and scientific relevance of research on strategic and non-profit communication in general and on refugee organizations’ public communication in particular have increased. Nevertheless, these fields remain underdeveloped and are mostly text-focused, while the production and reception dimensions are barely explored. Remarkably, however, little or no research has been conducted from an organizational communication perspective, although this article demonstrates that the subject can be adequately embedded in and examined from the fields of strategic, non-profit and public communication. Finally, the article highlights the relevance of the holistic Communicative Constitution of Organizations perspective and argues that future research can benefit by adopting multi-perspective, practice-oriented, multi-methodological, comparative and/or interdisciplinary approaches. © 2019 by the authors.","Communicative constitution of organizations; Displacement crises; Mediated humanitarianism; Non-profit communication; Public communication; Refugee organizations; Strategic communication",,,,,,,,,,"Altheide, D.L., Media logic and political communication (2004) Political Communication, 21 (3), pp. 293-296; Altheide, D.L., Snow, R.P., (1979) Media logic., , Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage Publications; Andersson, R., Rescued and caught: The humanitarian-security nexus at Europe’s frontiers (2017) The borders of ‘Europe’: Autonomy of migration, tactics of bordering, pp. 64-94. , N.

This study addresses that void by using a sensemaking approach to examine how emerging technology was appropriated and enacted in the convergent news activities of newsworkers, and how they made sense of the emerging technologies over two and a half years. Our study analyzes two newsrooms in Singapore: 1) a digital-first legacy newspaper, and 2) an independent digital-only news startup. This article employs the Infotendencias Group’s (2012) analytical framework and its four dimensions of news convergence: i) business, ii) professional, iii) technological, and iv) contents. Additionally, it proposes and employs a fifth dimension: v) audience-centric engagement. The fifth dimension is based on the concept of “measurable journalism” (Carlson, 2018), analyzing how its actors influence the relationship between newsrooms and their audiences. This study builds on two rounds of in-depth interviews conducted from end-2015 to mid-2016, and again in 2018. Our findings show that audience-centric-engagement practices are observed in all four dimensions of convergent news activities of each news organization, and leads to three main conclusions: 1) the growing significance of audience-centric engagement, 2) an emergence of a collaboration culture, and 3) the salience of platform counterbalancing. © 2019 by the authors; tion.","Audience engagement; Collaboration; Convergence; Digital journalism; Emerging technology; Measurable journalism; Sensemaking; Social media platforms",,,,,,,,,,"Ali, C., Schmidt, T.R., Radcliffe, D., Donald, R., The digital life of small market newspapers (2018) Digital Journalism.

The conceptual framework presented is intended to inspire and guide future studies relating to the emerging sub-field of journalism research that we refer to as “Epistemologies of Digital Journalism”. The article discusses the dependencies between news media and social media platforms (non-proprietary to the news media). The authority and democratic role of news journalism pivot on claims that it regularly provides accurate and verified public knowledge. However, how are the epistemic claims of news journalism and the practices of justifications affected by news journalism’s increased dependency on social media platforms? This is the overall question discussed in this article. It focuses on the intricate power dependencies between news media and social media platforms and proceeds to discuss implications for epistemology. It presents a three-fold approach differentiating between (1) articulated knowledge and truth claims, (2) justification in the journalism practices and (3) the acceptance/rejections of knowledge claims in audience activities.

This article investigates a sample of 24 countries for which data are available in the Migrant Integration Policy Index (MIPEX), the World Values Survey (WVS), as well as in the Worlds of Journalism Study (WJS). To our knowledge, this is the first time that these data are connected to one another to study journalists’ views on their role to promote tolerance and cultural diversity in societies with diverging immigration policies. The WJS presents an analysis of the role conceptions of professional journalists throughout the world, including a variable measuring the extent to which journalists conceive promoting tolerance and cultural diversity as one of their tasks. Our findings show that journalists (as measured in the WJS) mostly tend to promote tolerance and cultural diversity in countries with more restrictive immigration policies (measured by MIPEX) and less emancipative values (measured by the WVS) Promoting tolerance and cultural diversity is associated with a so-called interventionist approach in journalism culture. Furthermore, we used cluster analyses to attribute the countries under study to meaningful, separate groups. More precisely, we discriminate four clusters of the press among the 24 countries under investigation. © 2019 by the authors.","Cultural diversity; Immigration; Integration policy; Journalism culture; Public opinion; Tolerance",,,,,,,,,,"Archer, P., (2013) Interactive Map of Europe, , https://philarcher.org/diary/2013/euromap; Bennett, S., Ter Wal, J., Lipinski, A., Fabiszak, M., Krzyzanowski, M., The representation of third-country nationals in European news discourse: Journalistic perceptions and practices (2013) Journalism Practice, 7 (3), pp. 248-265; Berry, M., Garcia-Blanco, I., Moore, K., Press cov-erage of the refugee and migrant crisis in the EU: A content analysis of five European countries (2016) Geneva: United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees; Broersma, M., Objectiviteit als professionele strategie.

Despite being little more than 50 years old, the medium of digital games has seen a meteoric rise to economic and cultural prominence across the globe. A cultural shift accepting games as a worthwhile recreational activity (and more) is likewise resulting in shifting attentions within game studies. Games were seen as frivolous and even harmful, and research traditionally focused on the negative effects they were perceived to have while in the end coming up with very little reliable evidence to support this position. The current wave of games research exemplified in this issue is certainly wider: games are a cultural and often highly socialised medium that has changed the way we view the world.

We observe that cities are struggling due to the fragmentation of data and services across different governmental levels. This may cause frustrations in the everyday life of citizens as they expect a coherent user experience. Our research question considers the relationship between individual characteristics of decision makers and their intention to use data standards. We identified criteria for implementing data standards in the public sector by analysing the factors that affect the adoption of data governance, based on the Technology Readiness and Acceptance Model (TRAM), by conducting an online survey (n = 205). Results indicate that respondents who score high on innovativeness have a higher intention to use data standards. However, we conclude that personality characteristics as described in the TRAM-model are not significant predictors of the perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use of data standards. Therefore, we suggest exploring the effects of network governance and organisational impediments to speed-up the adoption of open standards and raise interoperability in complex ecosystems. © 2018 by the authors; licensee Cogitatio (Lisbon, Portugal).","Data governance; Decentralisation; E-government; Interoperability; Linked data; Policy making; Smart cities; Standardisation; TRAM",,,,,,"European Research Council, ERC

As research has revealed, this type of user engagement seems to be growing parallel to the recent wave of populism in Western democracies. In a systematization, some essential aspects of dark participation will be differentiated. Finally, the benefits of (also) looking at the wicked side of things will be discussed. © 2018 by the author; licensee Cogitatio (Lisbon, Portugal).","Citizen engagement; Dark participation; Fake news; News-making process; Participatory journalism; Populism; Propaganda; User-generated content",,,,,,,,,,"Allan, S., (2006) Online News: Journalism and the Internet, , Maidenhead: Open University Press; Allcott, H., Gentzkow, M., Social media and fake news in the 2016 election (2017) Journal of Economic Per-Spectives, 31 (2), pp. 211-236; Anderson, A.A., Yeo, S.K., Brossard, D., Scheufele, D.A., Xenos, M.A., Toxic talk: How online incivility can undermine perceptions of media (2018) International Journal of Public Opinion Research, 30 (1), pp. 156-168; Aro, J., The cyberspace war: Propaganda and trolling as warfare tools (2016) European View, 15 (1), pp. 121-132; Bivens, R.K., The Internet, mobile phones and blogging: How new media are transforming traditional journalism (2008) Journalism Practice, 2 (1), pp. 113-129; Bowman, S., Willis, C., (2003) We Media: How Audi-Ences are Shaping the Future of News and Information, , http://www.hypergene.net/wemedia/download/we_media.pdf, Reston, VA: The Media Center at the American Press Institute; Bruns, A., (2008) Blogs, Wikipedia, Second Life and Be-Yond: From Production to Produsage.

Nonetheless, this evolution towards more digital services and communication by governments raises questions in terms of inclusivity and accessibility. We conducted focus groups with a heterogeneous panel of over 80 citizens, ranging from non-users of digital technologies to high-level users, to study their choice of channel and their perception towards the evolving digitisation of communication and services, applied to the case of spatial planning in Flanders (Belgium). The results reveal that the most decisive channel choice determinants in spatial planning relate to the channel characteristics themselves, the information, the contextual aspect of the communication flow, and digital inequality mechanisms; meaning that (a) citizens opt for local communication channels when interacting with local, regional, and national governments, (b) citizens prefer to be personally informed when the communicated message has a direct impact on them, and (c) more vulnerable digital profiles consider the transition to digital communication by default as problematic. © 2018 by the authors; licensee Cogitatio (Lisbon, Portugal).","Channel choice; Digital by default; Government communication; Government services; Media user profiles; Public services; Spatial planning",,,,,,"Vlaamse regering","We would like to acknowledge the Department of Environment and Spatial Development and the Department of Public Governance and the Chancellery of the Flemish Government for funding the project and our respondents for participating.",,,"Afzalan, N., Evans-Cowley, J., Planning and social media: Facebook for planning at the neigh-neigh-bourhood scale (2015) Planning Practice & Research, 30 (3), pp. 270-285. , bourhood; Aizen, I., The theory of planned behavior (1991) Orga-Nizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes, 50 (2), pp. 179-211; Al-Hujran, O., Al-Debei, M.M., Chatfield, A., Migdadi, M., The imperative of influencing citizen attitude toward e-government adoption and use (2015) Com-Puters in Human Behavior, 53, pp. 189-203; Almuwil, A., Weerakkody, V., El-Haddadeh, R., A conceptual study of the factors influencing e-inclusion.

This application of ICT in governments has been conceptualized as “e-government”. However, more recently, smart cities emerged as a locally-embedded paradigm that proposes the design of innovative solutions across all domains of our everyday life (mobility, environment, economy, education, quality of life, and governance) with ICT as an enabler. In their recent evolutions, these two concepts have advocated for increased involvement of their stakeholders (citizens, businesses, public servants, etc.) through user-participation methods to support the design of their projects. This article intends to examine how these methods impact an e-government project and, more particularly, to find out which challenges and benefits practitioners experience. In order to reach that goal, we studied the case of the city of La Louvière (Belgium) through a one year plus study following action research’s best practices. This article contributes at several levels. First, it describes the challenges and benefits experienced with participation methods in a concrete project. Second, it proposes an e-government implementation process enhanced with these methods. Third, this article discusses the similarities and differences between e-government and smart cities through the lens of participation methods. © 2018 by the authors.","Action research; Citizen; E-government; Information and communication technologies; Smart city; User participation",,,,,,"Belgian Federal Science Policy Office","The authors would like to thank BELSPO, the Belgian Federal Science Policy office, for their support.

It highlights a complex platform-based urban ecosystem encompassing private and public organisations and citizens. This ‘mainstreaming’ of e-government practices puts demands on cities and governments to reconsider their own role in ‘city making’ so as to achieve meaningful public oversight. The point of departure is the op-erationalization of this ‘place’ by conceptualizing participation and (multi-sided) platformisation as a framework to draw attention to the dynamic domain of e-governance where shifts can be seen in market structures, infrastructures, and changing forms of governance, and which may challenge the public interest.

A decade later, what hath such research wrought? In the broad study of news and its digital transformation, few topics have captivated researchers quite like social media, with hundreds of studies on everything from how journalists use Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, and Snapchat to how such platforms facilitate various forms of engagement between journalists and audiences. Now, some 10 years into journalism studies on social media, we need a more particular accounting of the assumptions, biases, and blind spots that have crept into this line of research. Our purpose is to provoke reflection and chart a path for future research by critiquing themes of what has come before. In particular, our goal is to untangle three faulty assumptions—often implicit but no less influential—that have been overlooked in the rapid take-up of social media as a key phenomenon for journalism studies: (1) that social media would be a net positive; (2) that social media reflects reality; and (3) that social media matters over and above other factors. © 2018 by the authors.","Audience; Journalism; News; Research; Social media",,,,,,,,,,"Ahva, L., How is participation practiced by “in-betweeners” of journalism?

This case study examines the processes that underpin the ways in which the ‘Future City Glasgow programme’ delivered ‘smart governance’, in the context of a regenerating post-industrial city. We assess the contribution of smart city technologies and data collection and monitoring processes designed to facilitate citizen engagement and sustainable governance practices. The Future City Glasgow programme ran from 2013–2015, and included the Open Glasgow project, and ‘Demonstrator Projects’ of: Energy Efficiency; Intelligent Street Lighting; Active Travel; and, Integrated Social Transport. Opportunities arose from these demonstrators for developing co-production and legacy initiatives. The case study provides insight into the ways in which citizens and local communities in Glasgow have been engaged in governance processes. This engagement has taken place via traditional and innovative smart city technologies, and in particular in relation to policy formulation, service design and delivery. It finds that the co-creation of governance is shaped by vested interests, that engagement is fragmented and partial, but at the same time new technologies, social media and shared learning opportunities offer innovative new ways for some citizens to influence local governance. © 2018 by the authors; lition.","Citizen engagement; Co-production; EGovernment; Future City Glasgow; Glasgow; Post-industrial city; Smart governance; Sustainability",,,,,,"Economic and Social Research Council, ESRC: ES/N011473/1

However, often such processes of mediation exceed a rational understanding of the information revealed. Acting in the domain of the accident, the mediations of leaks operate in the dimension of the event: an immanent and particular set of relations that is provoked by the encounter and collision of various forces, virtually becoming their productive potential. This article advances the question of how data leaks―as a form of media dissent―operate beyond representation, touching upon the vital realm of affect. Intensively enabling a transformation in the state of the forces at play, affect generates possibilities within the emergent world that is constantly in creation. In this article, I argue that the politics of leaks in contemporary network ecologies works in such an affective register, possessing the capabilities to trigger and activate subjects differentially. Exploring the 2012 leak by Anonymous Italia, consisting of around 3,500 Italian police documents, mostly concerning the NoTav movement, I propose that the mediations of data leaks need to be studied and apprehended via their inductive capacities, as a question of affective politics, or alter-politics. © 2018 by the author; licensee Cogitatio (Lisbon, Portugal).","Affect; Affect theory; Affective politics; Anonymous; Data leaks; Media theory; Nonrepresentational theory; NoTav movement",,,,,,,,,,"Aime, M., (2016) Fuori Dal Tunnel: Viaggio Antropologico Nella Val Di Susa [Outside of the Tunnel: Anthropological Travel across Val Di Susa, , Milan: Meltemi; (2011) Operation Anti-Security.

As a result, journalists feel the need to moderate offensive user comments in order to prevent the derailment of discussion threads. However, little is known about the principles on which forum moderation is based. The current study aims to fill this void by examining 673,361 user comments (including all incoming and rejected comments) of the largest newspaper forum in Germany (Spiegel Online) in terms of the moderation decision, the topic addressed, and the use of insulting language using automated content analysis. The analyses revealed that the deletion of user comments is a frequently used moderation strategy. Overall, more than one-third of comments studied were rejected. Further, users mostly engaged with political topics. The usage of swear words was not a reason to block a comment, except when offenses were used in connection with politically sensitive topics. We discuss the results in light of the necessity for journalists to establish consistent and transparent moderation strategies. © 2018 by the authors; licensee Cogitatio (Lisbon, Portugal).","Community management; Computational methods; Forum moderation; Gatekeeping; Journalism; Participatory media; Spiegel Online; Topic modeling; User comments; User participation",,,,,,"Bundesministerium fÃ¼r Bildung und Forschung, BMBF","The research was funded by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research.

This article focuses on yet another shift towards how affect gets organized, i.e., how it is produced, classified, and controlled. It proposes a genealogical as well as a critical approach to the organization of affect and distinguishes between several “affect disposition(ing) regimes”—meaning paradigms of how to interpret and manage affects, for e.g., encoding them as byproducts of demonic possession, judging them in reference to a moralistic framework, or subsuming them under an industrial regime. Bernard Stiegler’s concept of psychopower will be engaged at one point and expanded to include social media and affective technologies, especially Affective Computing. Finally, the industrialization and cybernetization of affect will be contrasted with poststructuralist interpretations of affects as events. © 2018 by the author; licensee Cogitatio (Lisbon, Portugal).","Affective Computing; Disposition; Emotions; Event; Eventology; Genealogy; Psychopower; Theory",,,,,,"UniversitÃ¤t Potsdam, UP

The social and cultural formation of affect and emotion has been of central interest to social science-based emotion research as well as to affect studies, which are mainly grounded in cultural studies. Media and communication scholars, in turn, have especially focused on how emotion and affect are produced by media, the way they are communicated through media, and the forms of emotion audiences develop during the use of media. Distinguishing theoretical lines of emotion theory in social sciences and diverse traditions of affect theory, we reflect on the need to engage more deeply with affect and emotion as driving forces in contemporary media and society. This thematic issue aims to add to ongoing affect studies research and to existing emotion research within media studies. A special emphasis will be placed on exploring structures of difference and power produced in and by media in relation to affect and emotion. © 2018 by the authors; licensee Cogitatio (Lisbon, Portugal).","Affect; Body emotion; Communication; Media studies; Power",,,,,,,,,,"Angel, M., Gibbs, A., Media, affect and the face: Biomediation and the political scene (2006) Southern Review: Communication, Politics and Culture, 38 (2), pp. 24-39; Angerer, M.-L., (2014) Desire after Affect, , Lanham, MD: Rowman & Littlefield; Angerer, M.-L., (2017) Ecology of Affect.

To understand this process, we carried out three focus groups sessions along with 50 in-depth interviews. Strikingly we found that people perceive (correctly or not) that interactive voice response customer service technology is set up to deter them from pursuing further contact. And yet, for the most part, people were unwilling to simply give up on the goals that motivated their initial contact. Consequently, they had to innovate ways to communicate with the automated systems that essentially serve as gatekeepers to their desired ends.

Based on interview statements by 12 experts from the field of national and international reality TV format production, we argue as follows: on the one hand, producers in reality TV shows address belonging as a perceived cultural proximity to trans-local meta-narratives of a longing for change, romantic love, competition and victory. The producers associate these trans-local meta-narratives with allegedly universal emotions. On the other hand, the producers address belonging as a perceived cultural proximity to local cultural discourses on beauty ideals and combine these with a specific local cultural performance of emotions. The results show that an emotional repertoire is developed and negotiated in the adaptation process of trans-local formats. It refers to universalistic understanding of emotional display and negotiates specific “feeling rules” accordingly. © 2018 by the author; licensee Cogitatio (Lisbon, Portugal).","Belonging; Cultural proximity; Emotion repertoires; Emotions; Feeling rules; Format adaptation; Reality TV",,,,,,"Freie UniversitÃ¤t Berlin

Critical political economists argue that such acts contribute to value creation on social media and are therefore to be seen as labour. Following a brief introduction of this paradigm, I relate it to the notion of affective labour which has been popularised by the Marxist thinkers Michael Hardt and Antonio Negri. To them, affective labour (as a sub-category of immaterial labour) denotes embodied forms of labour that are about passion, well-being, feelings of ease, immaterial products and generally a kind of communicative relationality between individuals. I point to some problems with a lack of clarity in their conceptualisation of affective labour and argue that the Freudian model of affect can help in theorising affective labour further through a focus on social media. According to Freud, affect can be understood as a subjective, bodily experience which is in tension with the discursive and denotes a momentary feeling of bodily dispossession. In order to illustrate those points, I draw on some data from a research project which featured interviews with social media users who have facial disfigurements about their affective experiences online. The narratives attempt to turn embodied experiences into discourse. © 2018 by the author; licensee Cogitatio (Lisbon, Portugal).","Affective labour; Digital labour; Psychoanalysis; Social media",,,,,,,,,,"Ahmed, S., (2014) Cultural Politics of Emotion, , Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press; Andrejevic, M., Surveillance and alienation in the online economy (2011) Surveillance & Society, 8 (3), pp. 278-287; Andrejevic, M., Alienation’s returns (2014) Critique, Social Media and the Information Society, pp. 179-190. , C.

This article narrows its focus to the issue of emotion display during localization. Inspired by Paul Ekman’s neurocultural theory of emotion, which describes human emotion expression in actual social situations, this article attempts to apply Ekman’s ideas about relations between culture and emotion to the field of media communication and to build a theoretical framework for the analysis of cultural influence in emotion display during the adaptation of a TV format. Applying the theoretical findings to the case of the singing competition show The Voice of China (adapted from The Voice of Holland), this article shows how the collectivist nature of Chinese culture influences the aesthetic and dramatic tools used to elicit emotion and to control emotion display in the Chinese version of the show. © 2018 by the author; licensee Cogitatio (Lisbon, Portugal).","Emotion; Emotion display; Localization; Transnational television format",,,,,,,,,,"Darwin, C., (1974) The Expression of the Emotions in Men and Animals, , Chicago, IL: University of Chicago Press; Ekman, P., Universals and cultural differences in facial expressions of emotion (1972) Ne-Braska Symposium of Motivation, pp. 207-283. , J.

To encourage audience participation and to offer journalism that is both trustworthy and engaging, journalists of the future may embrace a hybrid practice of journalistic objectivity and audience-centred dialogue. As innovative and experimental actors, entrepreneurial journalism outlets can perform as forerunners of such a culture. By analysing discourses in the “About Us” pages of 41 entrepreneurial journalism outlets, the article examines the emerging journalistic ethos of entrepreneurial journalism and its participatory tendencies. The results show a conception of journalism that is a hybrid of the journalistic ideals of dialogue and objectivity. This kind of hybrid journalism and adjacent “hybrid engagement” can offer an answer to the dual challenge of how to make journalism more participation-friendly while at the same time hold on to the defining values and criteria of journalism. Drawing from futures research, the article concludes by sketching four scenarios of how entrepreneurial journalism and participatory hybrid engagement may develop in the future. © 2018 by the authors; licensee Cogitatio (Lisbon, Portugal).","Affect; Discourse analysis; Entrepreneurial journalism; Future of journalism; Futures research; Hybrid journalism; Participatory journalism; Scenarios",,,,,,"Liikesivistysrahasto","This research was supported by the Media Industry Research Foundation of Finland and the Finnish Foundation for Economic Education.",,,"Baym, G., Journalism and the hybrid condition: Long-form television drama at the intersections of news and narrative (2017) Journalism, 18 (1), pp. 11-26; Beckett, C., Deuze, M., On the role of emotion in the future of journalism (2016) Social Media + Society, pp. 1-6. , July– September 2016; Bennett, W.L., Segerberg, A., The logic of connective action (2012) Information, Communication & Soci-Ety, 15 (5), pp. 739-768; Benton, J., From the unbanked to the unnewsed: Just doing good journalism won’t be enough to bring back reader trust (2017) Nieman Journalism Lab, , http://www.niemanlab.org/2017/03/from-the-unbanked-to-the-unnewsed-just-doing-good-journalism-wont-be-enough-to-bring-back-reader-trust; Bødker, H., Vice Media Inc.: Youth, lifestyle—and news (2017) Journalism, 18 (1), pp. 27-43; Broersma, M., Peters, C., Introduction: Towards a functional perspective on journalism’s role and rele-rele-vance (2017) Rethinking Journalism Again.

In this commentary, I make an argument for why we should keep studying good participation. In addition, I claim that the flipside of studying exceptional case studies of participation shouldn’t be only focusing on dark participation, but on everyday, mundane forms of participation, that may happen in surprising contexts (such as non-proprietary platforms) and may take different shapes. To make these claims, I introduce a case study of “good participation” in news production processes, and explain why it may merit this distinction. I then use a three-pronged analogy to the cognate field of political participation to show what it can tell us about good—and everyday—participation in the news. © 2018 by the author; licensee Cogitatio (Lisbon, Portugal).","Citizen journalism; Dark participation; Everyday participation; Good participation; News; Participatory journalism; Political participation; Social media",,,,,,,,,,"Anderson, C.W., Revers, M., From counter-power to counter-pepe: The vagaries of participatory epistemology in a digital age (2018) Media and Communica-Tion, 6 (4), pp. 24-35; Hermida, A., (2014) Tell Everyone: Why We Share & Why It Matters, , Toronto: Doubleday Canada; Holton, A.E., Belair-Gagnon, V., Strangers to the game?

The present study examines whether these attributes of psychopathy are correlated with linguistic patterns present in everyday online communication. Participants’ emails, SMS messages, and Facebook messages were collected and analyzed in relation to their scores on the Self-Report Psychopathy Test III. The findings suggest that psychopathic tendencies leave a trace in online discourse, and that different forms of online media sometimes moderate the association between a linguistic dimension and psychopathy scores. Consistent with previous studies and the emotional and interpersonal deficits central to psychopathy, participants higher in psychopathy showed more evidence of psychological distancing, wrote less comprehensible discourse, and produced more interpersonally hostile language. The results reveal that linguistic traces of psychopathy can be detected in online communication, and that those with higher traits of psychopathy fail to modify their language use across media types. © 2018 by the authors; licensee Cogitatio (Lisbon, Portugal).","Computer-mediated communication; Email; Facebook; Online media; Psychopathy; Text messaging",,,,,,"Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada, SSHRC","This research was funded in part by a grant from SSHRC awarded to the second author.

The first is understanding affect as potential. It is through the forces of encounter that bodies are affected and that these affections then can be turned into action, into their capacity to affect. The second is understanding the perpetual becoming that takes place through continual encounters between bodies; with each encounter, the body changes, however slightly and subtly. The concept of assemblage that allows one to grasp these dynamics and complexities is discussed as an approach towards a much more complex theoretical grounding for processes of agency and power. Working with affect in media and communication studies, a three-fold strategy will be presented: to analyse how media generate affects and capitalise on them; to analyse what media do—in the sense of mobilizing potential; to analyse phenomena of mediated communication as assemblages. The article ends with challenges and new paths for conducting research on affect. © 2018 by the author; licensee Cogitatio (Lisbon, Portugal).","Affect; Affections; Assemblage; Communication; Media; Structure of feeling; Virtual/actual",,,,,,,,,,"Ahmed, S., (2004) The Cultural Politics of Emotion, , New York, NY: Routledge; Angerer, M.L., Affekt: Scham und Paranoia (2014) Affekt Und Geschlecht.

However, it is also a complex link. It encompasses how the news media and their social actors actively work towards enabling and engaging citizens as active participants through the digital infrastructures of their proprietary platforms, as well as the ways citizens potentially make use of such opportunities or not in their everyday lives, and how this affects epistemologies of news journalism. However, to date, journalism studies scholars have mostly focused on positive forms of participatory journalism via proprietary platforms, and thus fail to account for and problematize dark participation and participation taking place on social media platforms non-proprietary to the news media. This introduction, and the thematic issue as a whole, attempts to address this void. The introduction discusses three key aspects of journalism’s relationship with participation: 1) proprietary or non-proprietary platforms, 2) participants, and 3) positive or dark participation. © 2018 by the authors; licensee Cogitatio (Lisbon, Portugal).","Epistemology; Participatory journalism; Social media",,,,,,,"We are grateful to Scott Eldridge II, Seth C.

In contrast to other disciplines, however, communication research has been slow in studying them. In our view, there are at least three theoretical reasons for communication researchers to deal with social robots. First, social robots challenge our notions of medium and media. Second, social robots challenge our understanding of the communication partner. Finally, social robots challenge our notions of the boundaries of communication. We therefore believe that social robots should play a more central role in communication research than it is currently the case. © 2018 by the authors.","Communication science; Human-machine interaction; Human-robot interaction; Social robots",,,,,,"European Research Council, ERC

Although they have quite different ideological profiles, they share a clear and critical focus on immigration and mainstream journalistic representations of reality. Their message is that mainstream media conceal or distort information about negative societal and cultural consequences of immigration and that mainstream journalists have teamed up with the political elites and engage in witch-hunts of critics, while ignoring abuses by those in power. Such media outlets (especially online participatory media) need to be analyzed in the light of their position as self-perceived correctives of traditional media. There has been a remarkable surge of alternative media in Sweden with these traits in common during the past few years, and it is important to be able to discuss these media together as a phenomenon, while at the same time taking their differences into account. In relation to this, I argue that the notion of anti-systemness is useful in discussions of the impact these alternative media may (or may not) have on public discourse. In the article, I present a matrix that distinguishes between different types of anti-systemness: ideological anti-systemness and relational anti-systemness. The article therefore mainly presents a theoretical argument, rather than empirical findings, with the aim of pointing to a way forward for research about alternative media. © 2018 by the author; licensee Cogitatio (Lisbon, Portugal).","Alternative media; Anti-systemness; Counter-publics; ICAM; Immigration; Journalism; Media distrust; Polarization",,,,,,,,,,"Anderson, C.W., Revers, M., From counter-power to counter-Pepe: The vagaries of participatory epistemology in a digital age (2018) Media and Communica-Tion, 6 (4), pp. 24-35; Atkinson, J.D., Leon Berg, S.V., Nar-rowmobilization and Tea Party activism: A study of right-leaning alternative media (2012) Communication Studies, 63 (5), pp. 519-535. , https://doi.org/10.1080/10510974.2011.649442; Atton, C., Far-right media on the internet: Culture, discourse and power (2006) New Media & So-Ciety, 8 (4), pp. 573-587. , https://doi.org/10.1177/1461444806065653; Atton, C., (2015) The Routledge Companion to Alternative and Community Media, , New York, NY: Routledge; Bailey, O., Cammaerts, B., Carpentier, N., (2007) Un-Derstanding Alternative Media, , London: McGraw-Hill Education; Barbaro, M., (2016) How Did The media—how Did we— Get This Wrong?

The prevalence of digital communication and the dominance of proprietary platforms are two combining forces that disrupt the established journalistic norms. In this article, we investigate news participation and make three grand statements regarding: 1) the holistic definition of participation, 2) the network structure of participation delineating the power dynamics of different media actors, and 3) the transnational context of participation exhibiting the structural constraints within nation-state sovereignty. It is our argument that news participation as a civic act in the digital, globalized age has not fundamentally democratized the information flow as early optimists predicted. Instead, a group of “information elite” have risen to power due to their access to institutional resources, their advantageous positioning in the media ecology, and their entrenchment in the dominant ideology. Participation on proprietary platforms can be easily co-opted to serve the interest of the new information elite. © 2018 by the authors; licensee Cogitatio (Lisbon, Portugal).","Civic participation; News participation; Participatory journalism; Proprietary platforms; Social media",,,,,,,,,,"Ahva, L., How is participation practiced by “in-betweeners” of journalism?

Amateur journalists, bloggers, mobile app designers, programmers, web analytics managers, and others have become part of journalism, influencing the process of journalism from news production to distribution. These technology-oriented strangers—those who have not belonged to traditional journalism practice but have imported their qualities and work into it—are increasingly taking part in journalism, whether welcomed by journalists or shunned as interlopers. Yet, the labels that keep them at journalism’s periphery risk conflating them with much larger groups who are not always adding to the news process (e.g., bloggers, microbloggers) or generalizing them as insid-ers/outsiders. In this essay, we consider studies that have addressed the roles of journalistic strangers and argue that by delineating differences among these strangers and seeking representative categorizations of who they are, a more holistic understanding of their impact on news production, and journalism broadly, can be advanced. Considering the norms and practices of journalism as increasingly fluid and open to new actors, we offer categorizations of journalistic strangers as explicit and implicit interlopers as well as intralopers. In working to understand these strangers as innovators and disrup-tors of news production, we begin to unpack how they are collectively contributing to an increasingly un-institutionalized meaning of news while also suggesting a research agenda that gives definition to the various strangers who may be influencing news production and distribution and the organizational field of journalism more broadly. © 2018 by the authors; licensee Cogitatio (Lisbon, Portugal).","Digital news; Innovation; Interloper; Intraloper; Journalism; Media; News production; Strangers",,,,,,,,,,"Anderson, C.W., Revers, M., From counter-power to counter-pepe: The vagaries of participatory epistemology in a digital age (2018) Media and Communica-Tion, 6 (4), pp. 24-35; Baack, S., Practically engaged (2018) Digital Journalism, 6 (6), pp. 673-692; Belair-Gagnon, V., Holton, A., Boundary work, interloper media, and analytics in newsrooms: An analysis of the roles of web analytics companies in news production (2018) Digital Journalism, 5 (4), pp. 492-508; Belair-Gagnon, V., Owen, T., Holton, A., UAVs and journalism disruption: Perspectives from early professional adopters (2017) Digital Journalism, 5 (10), pp. 1226-1239; Blood, R., Weblogs and Journalism (2003) Nieman Re-Ports, 57 (3), pp. 61-63; Boczkowski, P.J., de Santos, M., When more media equals less news: Patterns of content homogenization in Argentina’s leading print and online newspapers (2007) Political Communication, 24 (2), pp. 167-180; Boczkowski, P.J., Siles, I., Steps toward cos-mopolitanism in the study of media technologies (2014) Media Technologies: Essays on Communication, Mate-Riality and Society, pp. 53-76. , Cambridge, MA: MIT Press; Boyles, J.L., The isolation of innovation: Restructuring the digital newsroom through intrapreneur-ship (2016) Digital Journalism, 4 (2), pp. 229-246; Boyles, J.L., Laboratories for news?

We do so through a genealogy of what we call “participatory epistemology”, defined here as a form of journalistic knowledge in which professional expertise is modified through public interaction. It is our argument that the notion of “citizen participation in news process” has not simply functioned as a normative concept but has rather carried with it a particular understanding of what journalists could reasonably know, and how their knowledge could be enhanced by engaging with the public in order to produce journalistic work. By examining four key moments in the evolution of participatory epistemology, as well as the discursive webs that have surrounded these moments, we aim to demonstrate some of the factors which led a cherished and utopian concept to become a dark and dystopian one. In this, we supplement the work of Quandt (2018) and add some historical flesh to the conceptual arguments of his article on “dark participation”. © 2018 by the authors; licensee Cogitatio (Lisbon, Portugal).","Andy Carvin; Buzzfeed; Citizen journalism; Indymedia; Memes; Meta-discourse; Participatory epistemology; Pepe the Frog; Populism; Trolls",,,,,,,,,,"Alexander, J.C., (2006) The Civil Sphere, , New York, NY: Oxford University Press; Anderson, C.W., (2013) Rebuilding the News: Metropoli-Tan Journalism in the Digital Age, , Philadelphia, PA: Temple University Press; Bakshy, E., Messing, S., Adamic, L.A., Exposure to ideologically diverse news and opinion on Facebook (2015) Science, 348 (6239), pp. 1130-1132. , https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aaa1160; Berry, J.M., Sobieraj, S., (2014) The Outrage Industry: Political Opinion Media and the New Incivility, , Oxford: Oxford University Press; Boczkowski, P.J., (2004) Digitizing the News: Innovation in Online Newspapers, , Cambridge, MA: MIT Press; Bogost, I., Montfort, N., (2009) Racing The Beam: The Atari Video Computer System, , Cambridge, MA: The MIT Press; Bourdieu, P., (1984) Distinction: A Social Critique of the Judgement of Taste, , Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press; Bourdieu, P., (1993) The Field of Cultural Production: Es-Says on Art and Literature, , New York: Columbia University Press; Chung, J., Jonah Peretti of Eyebeam (2005) Gothamist, , gothamist.com/2005/06/04/jonah_peretti_director_of_rd_at_eyebeam.php; Cramer, K.J., (2016) The Politics of Resentment: Rural Con-Sciousness in Wisconsin and the Rise of Scott Walker, , Chicago, IL: University of Chicago Press; Davison, P., The language of internet memes (2012) The Social Media Reader, pp. 120-134. , M.

This study insists that more attention be put on the relational and context-dependent nature of journalistic role conceptions. Adopting a social-interactionist approach to journalistic roles, the study examines how Finnish journalists conceived of their professional roles when covering asylum issues during the so-called “refugee crisis” of 2015–2016. Based on an analysis of open-ended, semi-structured interviews with 24 journalists, we highlight how considerations of the political context and interactions with three key reference groups—officials, asylum seekers and anti-immigrant publics— shaped the journalists’ conceptions of their tasks and duties. The article contributes to the study of journalistic role conceptions by illustrating how the conceptualisation of journalistic roles in relation to reference groups takes place in practice. It also sheds light on the tensions involved in journalistic balancing and negotiation between various available role conceptions, especially in the shifting societal and political contexts of a Europe marked by multiculturalism and the simultaneous rise of anti-immigrant movements. © 2018 by the authors; licensee Cogitatio (Lisbon, Portugal).","Asylum seekers; Journalism; Migration; Refugee crisis; Role; Role conception",,,,,,"Helsingin Sanomain SÃ¤Ã¤tiÃ¶","The authors appreciate the feedback given on earlier versions of this manuscript by Kaarina Nikunen and Mervi Pantti, as well as the reviewers and editors.

Violation of female bodies is approached as a site for politicizing possibilities of becoming a subject in the Western media. Informed by Deleuzian notion of “becoming” and the subjectivation of the refugees, I argue that the understanding of “violation” is a central component in contributing to possibilities of becoming affirmed as a subject in the Western media. Empirical material subjected to critical text analysis includes a key text form the Finnish daily newspaper Helsingin Sanomat and refugee interviews. The analysis suggests that the repression of irreducible conceptions of “violation,” and the subsequent erasure of the uncertainty of a “self” in the process of becoming, yields to offering possibilities of becoming primarily in Western terms and the affirmation of Western ideological certainty in understanding mass harassment of European women by the refugees. © 2018 by the authors; licensee Cogitatio (Lisbon, Portugal).","Body; Mass harassment; Media; Refugees; Subjectivity",,,,,,,"I am thoroughly indebted to remarkable anonymous reviewers who from different angles provided the kind of criticism that significantly contributed to this project.

The success of the show has been unprecedented among audiences back home in Iran, reaching millions of households. Using discourse analysis this article examines the potential of reality TV in widening the scope of public sphere and in providing a space for participation and representation. The key practices to illustrate this are ways diaspora position themselves as subjects through discursive practices to express agency in generating, participating and sharing opinions. Casual talk and the entertaining attribute of reality TV focused on the everyday life of ordinary people, constructs a space to normalize audience engagement with what is otherwise, restrictive taboo topics embedded in themes around belonging, homeland, gender, and identity. The article concludes that the broad system of discourse used by diaspora as participants in the reality show constructs a space for representation. It can be considered as a contribution to enhancing the public sphere to not only communicate and connect with their homeland but to express opinions on broader social issues as a practice of civic engagement. This unique adaptation of reality TV is an important aspect of globalization and in using new media to mobilize diaspora in connecting to homeland. © 2018 by the authors; licensee Cogitatio (Lisbon, Portugal).","Diaspora media; Homeland; Iranian diaspora; Migration; Public sphere; Reality TV",,,,,,,,,,"Appadurai, A., (1996) Modernity at Large-Cultural Dimensions of Globalization, , Minneapolis, Minn: University of Minnesota Press; Aslama, M., Pantti, M., Talking alone: Reality TV, emotions and authenticity (2006) European Journal of Cultural Studies, 9 (2), pp. 167-184; Ayish, M., Television reality shows in the Arab world (2011) Journalism Studies, 12 (6), pp. 768-779; Bajoghli, N., A London television station has convinced Iran the shah was great (2018) Foreign Policy, , http://foreignpolicy.com/2018/01/12/a-london-television-station-hasconvinced-iran-the-shah-was-great, January 12; Bignell, J., (2005) Big Brother: Reality TV in the Twentyfirst Century, , Basingstoke: Palgrave Macmillan; Bingchun, M., Who needs democracy if we can pick our favorite girl?

By applying a central category in social relations, trust/distrust as developed by Niklas Luhmann, this article contributes to the understanding of forced migration in the digital age. It presupposes that, without a strategy of trust, it would be almost impossible to cope with situations of unfamiliarity and uncertainty. By interviewing refugees, the question is in what contexts the refugee recognizes that they can trust (or not). The article concludes that through the combination of on- and offline communication practices, more varied mechanisms for the creation and stabilization of trust are provided. In contexts of unfamiliarity, interpersonal relations with the native inhabitants play an important role in bridging online and offline worlds. © 2018 by the authors; licensee Cogitatio (Lisbon, Portugal).","Media technologies; Migration; Refugee; Systems theory; Trust",,,,,,,,,,"Alencar, A.P., Refugee integration and social media (2017) A Local and Experiential Perspective, , Information, Communication & Society; Baldassar, L., De-demonizing distance in mobile family lives: Co-presence, care circulation and polymedia (2016) Global Networks, 16 (2), pp. 145-163; Beck, U., (1992) Risk Society: Towards a New Modernity, 17, p. 1986. , London: Sage.

The thematic issue is then anchored theoretically through discussion of the widely conceived notion of mediation as a technological, symbolic and ethical process―highlighting the interest in how media actors and communication technologies, practices and artefacts mediate between global phenomena and local contexts, which is what unites the contributions to this thematic issue.

Based on 30 in-depth interviews with women in Uasin Gishu County, Kenya, the article demonstrates that women have incorporated newly gained media into their daily lives and routines. Increased media access has opened up the home and turned the domestic sphere from a secluded place into a connected space in which women can receive input from, connect with and interact with the world beyond their immediate surroundings whilst simultaneously remaining at home and fulfilling their traditional gender roles. Women’s media use thus reinforces their connection to the domestic sphere and the gendered division of labour. Although it has the potential to challenge gender inequalities, the extent to which this occurs depends on the individual woman’s ability to act on the imaginaries and ideas that media carry. © 2018 by the authors; licensee Cogitatio (Lisbon, Portugal).","Domestic sphere; Gender roles; Kenya; Media and everyday life; Women’s media use",,,,,,,,,,"Abu-Lughod, L., The interpretation of culture(S) after television (1997) Representations, 59, pp. 109-134; Ahikire, J., African feminism in context: Reflections on the legitimation battles, victories and reversals (2014) Feminist Africa, 19, pp. 7-23; Appadurai, A., Disjuncture and difference in the global culture economy.

Throughout the article, I discuss the way sociopolitical messages, circulating in contemporary culture, represent an interesting element in terms of their intertextual referencing and postmodern blurring. Postmodern aesthetic features merge commodifying, resistive, and identifying processes, which can enable sociopolitical messages to spread into new arenas of resistance and fly under the radar, so to speak. In particular, I claim that new forms of engagement in social media communication produce an alternative venue for politics—one created by neoliberalism itself. I explain that sociopolitical messages presented via postmodern aesthetics in consumer culture, particularly when circulated using social media, can function counter-hegemonically, even while using hegemonic structures to gain commercial success. With this, the potential for change can come about; power lies in the hands (or social media accounts) of consumers. © 2018 by the authors; licensee Cogitatio (Lisbon, Portugal).","Consumer culture; Postmodern aesthetics; Resistance; Social media; Sociopolitical change",,,,,,,,,,"Adichie, C.N., (2014) We Should All Be Feminists, , New York, NY: Anchor Books; Adorno, T.W., Horkheimer, M., (1972) Dialectices of Enlightenment, , New York: The Seabury Press; Aouragh, M., Social media, mediation and the Arab revolutions (2016) Marx in the Age of Digital Capitalism, pp. 482-515. , C.

Theoretically, it employs the notion of the “dialectics of care” to examine the tactics used in ethical trade communication to reconcile care for oneself and one’s close ones with care for distant producers. Empirically, this article is based on the discourse-theoretical analysis of two interviews with the representatives of Polish ethical trade organisations: (1) a fair trade firm, Pizca del Mundo, and (2) an NGO, the Institute for Global Responsibility. The analysis finds that ethical trade organisations seek to harmonise care for distant producers with the interests of the Polish public through (1) embedding it into the discourse of product quality, or (2) linking it to care for oneself, one’s family and society while raising awareness of the global interconnectedness. © 2018 by the authors; licensee Cogitatio (Lisbon, Portugal).","Care; Discourse-theoretical analysis; Ethical trade; Fair trade; Interviews; Metageography; Moral education; Poland",,,,,,,,,,"Adams, M., Raisborough, J., Encountering the fairtrade farmer: Solidarity, stereotypes and the self-control ethos (2011) Papers on Social Representations, 20 (1), pp. 8.1-8.21; Archer, C., Fritsch, S., Global fair trade: Humanizing globalization and reintroducing the normative to international political economy (2010) Review of International Political Economy, 17 (1), pp. 103-128; Barnett, C., Cloke, P., Clarke, N., Malpass, A., Consuming ethics: Articulating the subjects and spaces of ethical consumption (2005) Antipode, 37 (1), pp. 23-45; Barnett, C., Land, D., Geographies of generosity: Beyond the “moral turn” (2007) Geoforum, 38 (6), pp. 1065-1075; Boenning, K., The introduction of fair trade in Poland: Opportunities and challenges (2009) BANWA, 6 (2), pp. 87-98; Calhoun, C.J., Imagining solidarity: Cosmopolitanism, constitutional patriotism, and the public sphere (2002) Public Culture, 14 (1), pp. 147-171; Carey, J.W., (2008) Communication as Culture: Essays on Media and Society (Revised Edition), , London: Taylor & Francis; Carpentier, N., (2017) The Discursive-Material Knot: Cyprus in Conflict and Community Media Participation, , New York, NY: Peter Lang; Carpentier, N., De Cleen, B., Bringing discourse theory into media studies: The applicability of discourse theoretical analysis (DTA) for the study of media practices and discourses (2007) Journal of Language and Politics, 6 (2), pp. 265-293; Carpentier, N., Spinoy, E., Introduction: From the political to the cultural (2008) Discourse Theory and Cultural Analysis, pp. 1-26. , N.

Using a combination of open online diaries and qualitative interviews with young Danes aged 15 to 18 who differ in social background and education, and with Bourdieu’s field theory as an analytical framework, the article investigates how cultural capital (CC) operates in specific tastes and distastes for news genres, platforms and providers. The article argues that distinction mechanism not only works on the level of news providers and news genres but also on the level of engagement practices—the ways in which people enact and describe their own news engagement practices. Among those rich in CC, physical, analogue objects in the form of newspapers and physical conversations about news are seen as ‘better’ that digital ones, resulting in a feeling of guilt when they mostly engage with news on social media. Secondly, young people with lower CC discard legacy news, which they see as elitist and irrelevant. Thirdly, those rich in CC are media and news genre savvy in the sense that it makes them able to critically evaluate the news they engage with across platforms and sites. © 2018 by the author.","Diaries; Distinction; Engagement; Field theory; Media; News; Social media intermediaries; Young people",,,,,,,,,,"Barnhurst, K.G., Wartella, E., Young citizens, American TV newscasts and the collective memory (1998) Critical Studies in Mass Communication, 15 (3), pp. 279-305; Bengtsson, S., Digital distinctions: Mechanisms of difference in digital media use (2015) Mediekultur, 31 (58), pp. 30-48; Bennett, T., Savage, M., Silva, E., Warde, A., Gayo-Cal, M., Wright, D., (2008) Culture Class Distinction, , London: Routledge; Bird, S.E., Seeking the audience for news: Response, news talk, and everyday practices (2011) The Handbook of Media Audiences, pp. 489-508. , In V.

By critically rethinking the relationship between media and social space this issue takes initial steps towards ensuring that media studies is appropriate for a mediatized world. Contemporary societies are permeated by media that play important roles in how people maneuver and position themselves in the social world. Yet, analyses of media-related social change too often fail to engage with the complex and situated nature of power relations. This editorial highlights three enduring problems: (1) the annihilation of the socially structured and structuring role of media technologies and practices; (2) the conflation of inherent social capacities of media technologies and discourses with existing mediations of power, and (3) the reduction of social space to one predominant dimension which overshadows all other forms of social power that media technologies, discourses, and practices are part of. As a response to these problems—and in bringing together the arguments of the five articles included in the thematic issue—this editorial calls for sociologized approaches to media technologies, discourses, and practices. © 2018 by the authors.","Media discourse; Media practice; Media sociology; Media technology; Mediatization; Power; Social space",,,,,,,,,,"Abeele, M.V., De Wolf, R., Ling, R., Mobile media and social space: How anytime, anyplace connectivity structures everyday life (2018) Media and Communication, 6 (2), pp. 5-14; Bengtsson, S., Sensorial organization as an ethics of space: Digital media in everyday life (2018) Media and Communication, 6 (2), pp. 39-45; Bourdieu, P., (2000) Pascalian Meditations, , Cambridge: Polity; Chan, N.K., Humphreys, L., Mediatization of social space and the case of Uber drivers (2018) Media and Communication, 6 (2), pp. 29-38; Couldry, N., Hepp, A., (2016) The Mediated Construction of Reality, , Cambridge: Polity; Ekström, M., Fornäs, J., Jansson, A., Jerslev, A., Three tasks for mediatization research: Contributions to an open agenda.

We emphasize the role of nostalgia as an explanation for contemporary retro gaming trends, and suggest that nostalgia towards gaming events is a necessary area of research. To those ends, we broadly review existing literature on nostalgia before specifically focusing on media-induced nostalgia, and demonstrate how theoretical and empirical observations from this work can be applied to understand video game nostalgia. In particular, we argue that engaging in older gaming experiences indirectly (via memories) and even directly (via replaying or recreating experiences) elicits nostalgia, which in turn contributes to players’ self-optimization and enhanced well-being. Moreover, as gamers and the medium mature together, nostalgic experiences with the medium are likely to become increasingly prevalent. The broad aim of this article is to offer future directions for research on video game nostalgia and provide a research agenda for research in this area. © 2018 by the authors; licensee Cogitatio (Lisbon, Portugal).","Entertainment; Nostalgia; Retro gaming; Video games; Well-being",,,,,,,"Tim Wulf (MA, University of Cologne, Germany) is a PhD student of Media Psychology at the University of Cologne in Germany.

Model matching explains and predicts individuals’ outcomes related to gameplay by focusing on the interrelationships among games’ systems of mechanics, relevant situations external to the game, and players’ mental models. Formalizing model matching theory in this way provides researchers a unified explanation for game-based learning, game performance, and related gameplay outcomes while also providing a theory-based direction for advancing the study of games more broadly. The propositions explicated in this article are intended to serve as the primary tenets of model matching theory. Considerations for how these propositions may be tested in future games studies research are discussed. © 2018 by the authors; licensee Cogitatio (Lisbon, Portugal).","Game mechanics; Game-based learning; Media effects; Mental models; Model matching; Skill acquisition; Video games",,,,,,,,,,"Battaglia, P.W., Hamrick, J.B., Tenenbaum, J.B., Simulation as an engine of physical scene understanding (2013) Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 110, pp. 18327-18332; Bergman, M., Paavola, S., The Commens Dictionary: Peirce’s Terms in His Own Words, , http://www.commens.org/dictionary/term/icon; Biocca, F., Viewers’ mental models of political ads: Towards a theory of the semantic processing of television (1991) Television and Political Advertising: Vol 1.

Three types of formalism in game studies are identified based on a review of their uses in the literature, particularly the discussion of essentialism and form that resulted from the narratology-ludology debate: 1) formalism focused on the aesthetic form of the game artifact, 2) formalism as game essentialism, and 3) formalism as a level of abstraction, related to formal language and ontology-like reasoning. These three are discussed in relation to the distinctions between form and matter, in the Aristotelian tradition, to highlight how the method of formal analysis of games appears to be dealing with matter rather than form, on a specific fundamental level of abstraction, and in turn how formal analysis becomes a misleading concept that leads to unnecessary confusion. Finally, the relationship between game essentialism and the more computer science-centric approach to ontology is studied, to account for the contemporary trend of identifying the unique properties of games and opposing them with properties of, e.g., traditional storytelling media like literature and film, explored through their aesthetic form. © 2018 by the authors; licensee Cogitatio (Lisbon, Portugal).","Aesthetic formalism; Game formalism; Game studies; Research ideologies; Research methods; Russian formalism",,,,,,,,,,"Aarseth, E., Computer game studies, year one (2001) Game Studies, 1 (1). , http://gamestudies.org/0101/editorial.html; Aarseth, E., Define real, moron!

At the same time, how to best evaluate learning presents challenges, especially when the game does not have standardized assessments built-into it and when games are taken up in a wide variety of ways in quite diverse contexts. This article details the use of a geography game to support learning in 32 diverse classrooms in Ontario, Canada, alongside challenges with evaluating student learning using a game that did not have a built-in assessment system. In total, 795 students participated in the study. Classroom observations and interviews with teachers were triangulated with student pre and post evaluations. Results demonstrated that students did learn from gameplay, as demonstrated through multiple choice and short answer change scores in the pre to post evaluation, despite variations in duration of play and how the game was integrated in the classroom more generally. © 2018 by the authors; licensee Cogitatio (Lisbon, Portugal).","Assessment; Digital games; Game-based learning; Games",,,,,,,"We would like to acknowledge the Council for Ontario Directors of Education for funding the project, and the teachers and students for participating.",,,"All, A., Nunez Castellar, E.P., Van Looy, J., Measuring effectiveness in digital game-based learning: A methodological review (2014) International Journal of Serious Games, 1 (2), pp. 3-20; Annetta, L., Video games in education: Why they should be used and how they are being used (2008) Theory into Practice, 47 (3), pp. 229-239; Brysch, C.P., Huynh, N.T., Scholz, M., Evaluating educational computer games in geography: What is the relationship to curriculum requirements?

The workplace is one sphere that is increasingly datafied. This study explores how Uber drivers, a form of digitally-enabled service workers, contribute to the normalization of the social production of space through their interpretative practices of digital data in an online forum. Drawing on Uber’s corporate discourse and an Uber driver online forum, we analyze two facets of the Uber app and drivers’ mediated experiences: (1) the quantification and discipline of drivers’ performance through Uber’s rating system and (2) the coordination of spatial movement through location-related metrics. We argue that the underlying workings of the Uber app premediate expectations of service encounters and spatial movement. Uber drivers meanwhile develop practices which respond to and circumvent their own data contributions to the system. Drivers’ practices, we argue, are largely in compliance with the calculative logics set by Uber. The article addresses implications of Uber drivers’ practices for the reproduction of social space and power-relations in digitally-enabled service work and the gig economy. © 2018 by the authors.","Digitally-enabled service work; Mediatization; Mobile apps; Ratings; Social space; Uber; Work practices",,,,,,,,,,"Anderson, C., Between creative and quantified audiences: Web metrics and changing patterns of newswork in local US newsrooms (2011) Journalism, 12 (5), pp. 550-566; Anderson, D.N., The taxicab-hailing encounter: The politics of gesture in the interaction order (2014) Semiotica, 202, pp. 609-629; Ball, K., Workplace surveillance: An overview (2010) Labor History, 51 (1), pp. 87-106; Bhuiyan, J., (2018) Uber Powered Four Billion Rides in 2017, , https://www.recode.net/2018/1/5/16854714/uber-four-billion-rides-coo-barney-harford-2018-cut-costs-customer-service, January 5, It wants to do more—and cheaper—in 2018.

It helps to make sense of the self, to learn, to be creative and to relax. The advent of video games challenged traditional notions of play, introducing a single player experience to what had primarily been a communal social activity. As technology has developed, communal play has found both online and real-world spaces within video games. Online streaming, multiplayer games and built-in spectator modes within games underpin online communal play experiences, whilst ‘alternative’ games festivals, play parties and electronic sports, provide real world spaces for people to meet, play and exchange knowledge relating to both playing and making video games. This article reports the study of social play events which bring people together in the same space to explore video games making and playing. Expert interviews with curators, and event facilitators provides qualitative data from which design processes are formalised into a ‘model of participation’ of social play. Four key areas of balance are proposed as core considerations in supporting participation in event design. The study of these events also suggests that their design and fostering of participation has the potential to evoke cultural change in game making and playing practices. © 2018 by the authors; licensee Cogitatio (Lisbon, Portugal).","Cultural intermediaries; Cultural transformation; Games; Independent video games; Social play events",,,,,,,,,,"(2017) A Maze/Berlin 2018, , http://amaze-berlin.de; (2017) Arcadia: A Celebration of Independent Games, , https://www.arcadiadundee.com; Balzer, D., (2014) Curationism: How Curating Took over the Art World and Everything Else, , London: Pluto Press; Talk & play (2018) Berlingame Scene.Com, , http://berlingamescene.com/talkandplay; Bogost, I., The rhetoric of video games (2008) The Ecology of Games: Connecting Youth, Games, and Learning, pp. 117-140. , In K.

Less is known, however, about how mediatisation is discursively constructed. The relevance of constructivist approaches to mediatisation has been explicated, e.g., by Krotz (2017), who calls for critical mediatisation studies that consider the economic interests of mediatisation stakeholders, including the ICT industry. Against this backdrop, this article scrutinizes what the alleged ‘mobility revolution’ entails according to some who would benefit most from such a revolution. More concretely, the article studies the discursive practices of three leading corporations in the mobile communications sector: IBM, Huawei, and Ericsson. Stimulated by critical mediatisation theory as well as related accounts of the (technology) discourse-reality relationship, the article asks: if mobile media changes ‘everything’ in life—whose lives are being changed? If mobile media are ‘indispensable’ to modern ways of living—what are they supposed to do? Ultimately, the article speaks to the theme of this thematic issue by interrogating how contemporary mobile technology discourse contributes to the (re-)production of social space. Findings suggest that mediatisation is constructed as the response to an internal human drive for connectivity and as an inexorable natural force. Three sub-discourses on mobile technology are identified: ‘technologies of cosmos’, ‘technologies of self’, and, ultimately, ‘technologies of life’. Altogether, these sub-discourses disclose and reinforce the hegemonic nature of mediatisation by communicating the indispensability of mobile media in modern—notably, urban and privileged—lives. In addition to providing answers to the study’s empirical questions, the article includes a discussion about the potential implications of existing discourse overlaps between ICT companies and mediatisation theorists, as well as a sketch for an agenda for the ‘discursive turn’ in mediatisation studies. © 2018 by the authors.","Discursive turn; Media indispensability; Mediatisation; Mobile media; Mobility revolution; Social construction of technology (SCOT); Social space; Technology discourse",,,,,,,"This study was part of the research program In-Between Spaces: Digital Media Geographies and Social Transformations in Small Towns, initiated by the Geomedia Research Group and funded by Karlstad University.

Conversely, what contributions can artists and scholars exploring the medium make to the cultural conversation around their use and meaning? This contribution highlights the ways in which our interdisciplinary art collective, Psychasthenia Studio, has addressed the cultural effects of games and gamification as they have evolved over the last decade, using a series of videogame art projects as the medium of expression and critique. As Mary Flanagan (2009) suggested in Critical Play, “games carry beliefs within their representation systems and mechanics” (p. 4). Through their thematic content and interaction design, the three videogames developed by us in the interdisciplinary Psychasthenia Studio between 2009-2017 draw attention to those beliefs as they exist not only in the games themselves, but also more broadly in an increasingly gamified contemporary culture. Psychasthenia Studio simultaneously intervenes in the discussion around games in society and pushes the boundaries of what constitutes new media art practice today. By playing the Psychasthenia games, our hope is that users both co-author and witness their own participation in the system. © 2018 by the authors; licensee Cogitatio (Lisbon, Portugal).","Activist games; Critical play; Game studies; Gamification; Installation art; New media; Psychology; Subversion; Videogames",,,,,,,,,,"(2010) Violent Video Games May Increase Aggression in Some but Not Others, Says New Research [Press Release], , https://www.apa.org/news/press/releases/2010/06/violent-video-games.aspx, June 10; Bogost, I., Why gamification is bullshit (2014) The Gameful World: Approaches, Issues, Applications, pp. 65-79. , In S.

Despite being little more than 50 years old, the medium of digital games has seen a meteoric rise to economic and cultural prominence across the globe. A cultural shift accepting games as a worthwhile recreational activity (and more) is likewise resulting in shifting attentions within game studies. Games were seen as frivolous and even harmful, and research traditionally focused on the negative effects they were perceived to have while in the end coming up with very little reliable evidence to support this position. The current wave of games research exemplified in this issue is certainly wider: games are a cultural and often highly socialised medium that has changed the way we view the world. They are used in non-entertainment settings, helping to promote active learning in players of all ages. The medium also facilitates deeper psychological and philosophical theorizing, as researchers grapple with deeper questions on what games and play mean to each of us. Put simply: games research is not just fun and games. © 2018 by the authors; licensee Cogitatio (Lisbon, Portugal).","Culture; Digital games; Effects; Serious games; Social panic",,,,,,"Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek, NWO

This is made from a perspective of an ‘ethics of the ordinary’, highlighting the mundane negotiations and practices conducted to maintain a ‘good life’ with the media. The analysis shows a sensorial organization of space is conducted in relation to social space, as well as individually. The interviewees use facilities provided by media technologies in order to organize space, as well as organize their media devices spatially in order to construct space for specific purposes, and maintain a good life. These results call for a deepened analysis of the sensorial dimensions of everyday space, in order to understand the ethical struggles of a life with digital media. It is important to include the full spectrum of sensorial experiences in our approach to everyday life and to take the sensorial experiences of ordinary media users into account in our analysis of space as part of an everyday ethics. © 2018 by the author.","Digital media; Ethics; Everyday life; Phenomenology; Sensorial; Space",,,,,,,,,,"Bauman, Z., Donskis, L., (2013) Moral Blindness: The Loss of Sensitivity in Liquid Modernity, , Hoboken, NJ: John Wiley & Sons; Bausinger, H., Media, technology and daily life (1984) Media Culture & Society, 6 (4), pp. 343-351; Bengtsson, S., Symbolic spaces of everyday life (2006) Nordicom Review, 27 (2), pp. 119-132; Bengtsson, S., Johansson, B., Mediemoral i en digital värld [Media morality in a digital world] (2015) Fragment, pp. 551-559. , In A.

We argue that the anytime, anyplace connectivity afforded by mobile communication technologies structures society by imposing a network, social and personal logic. We discuss how each logic both reproduces and challenges traditional power structures, at the micro- as well as macro-level. At the micro-level, the network logic refers to mobile communication technologies’ capacity to organize activities in a networked fashion, granting people greater autonomy from time and place. The social logic refers to mobile communication technologies’ capacity for perpetual contact, fostering social connectedness with social relationships. The personal logic refers to mobile communication technologies’ capacity to serve as extensions of the Self, with which people can personalize contents, services, place and time. The flipside of these logics is that, at the micro-level, the responsibility to operate autonomously, to maintain personal social networks, and to manage and act based on personal information shifts to the individual. We also notice shifts in power structures at the macro-level. For instance, to reap the benefits of mobile communication technology individuals engage in free ‘digital labor’ and tolerate new forms of surveillance and control. © 2018 by the authors.","Giddens; Logics; Mobile media; Power; Responsibilization; Social structure",,,,,,,,,,"Altheide, D.L., Media logic, social control, and fear (2013) Communication Theory, 23 (3), pp. 223-238; Altheide, D.L., Snow, R.P., (1985) Media Logic, , Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage Publications; Balmas, M., When fake news becomes real: Combined exposure to multiple news sources and political attitudes of inefficacy, alienation, and cynicism (2014) Communication Research, 41 (3), pp. 430-454; Baumeister, R.F., Leary, M.R., The need to belong: Desire for interpersonal attachments as a fundamental human motivation (1995) Psychological Bulletin, 117 (3), pp. 497-529; Beck, U., Giddens, A., Lash, S., (1994) Reflexive Modernization: Politics, Tradition and Aesthetics in the Modern Social Order, , Stanford, CA: Stanford University Press; Belk, R.W., Possessions and the extended self (1988) Journal of Consumer Research, 15 (2), pp. 139-168; Bertel, T.F., It’s like I trust it so much that I don’t really check where it is I’m going before I leave”: Informational uses of smartphones among Danish youth (2013) Mobile Media & Communication, 1 (3), pp. 299-313; Bourdieu, P., Habitus: A sense of place (2005) Habitus: A Sense of Place, pp. 43-52. , In J.

J. Fogg’s conceptual framework on the role computer technology plays for users as a starting point, this article argues that persuasion through digital games can be approached from three different perspectives: digital games as media for persuasion, digital games as tools for persuasion and digital games as social actors for persuasion. In this article, I use five cancer gaming cases to illustrate how these three different persuasive roles can be used to accomplish different persuasive goals. In this respect, I explain how each of these persuasive roles digital games can play in the process of persuasion can serve to support cancer patients to face three different challenges: (1) lack of information about the treatment or the disease itself, (2) lack of motivation to start or continue with the treatment, and (3) difficulties in coping with the treatment or the disease. The analysis of these games is theoretical in nature and is done to illustrate my arguments. The categorization proposed in this article can be used as an analytical approach for the study of persuasive gaming strategies. © 2018 by the authors; licensee Cogitatio (Lisbon, Portugal).","Cancer games; Persuasion; Persuasive games; Persuasive technology; Serious games; Theoretical model",,,,,,"Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek, NWO

These debates demonstrate how media policy discourse has shaped democratic ideals, including by designating whose voices are or are not included in broadcast and digital communication spaces. The discourse emerging from both media policy debates reveals that fears concerning cultural hegemony and the diversity of expression in the United States have intertwined with fears concerning the invasion of foreign ideologies.

Taking media as a mode of public pedagogy, and drawing extensively from Dewey’s Democracy and Education, as well as from his book The Public and its Problems, the article explores the relationships between communication, education and democracy using the expanded conceptions of all the aforementioned advanced by Dewey. Borrowing insights from Randolph Bourne, who used Dewey’s own ideas to criticize his mentor’s influence on intellectuals who supported US involvement in World War I, the analysis explores the contradictions within Dewey’s public pedagogy. The article suggests Dewey’s relevance as a public intellectual in the liberal-progressive press, his view of the State and some of his related presuppositions produced a tension in his thought, delimiting democratic possibilities while simultaneously pointing toward greater democratic potentials. The essay concludes by suggesting that learning from both Dewey and Bourne prompts us to get beyond the former’s public/private dualism to realize what he called the “Great Community” by communicating and practicing the Commons. © 2018 by the author; licensee Cogitatio (Lisbon, Portugal).","John Dewey; Media; Media history; Public pedagogy; Randolph bourne; The New Republic",,,,,,,,,,"Bennett, S.H., Howlett, C.F., (2014) Antiwar Dissent and Peace Activism in World War I America: A Documentary Reader, , Lincoln, NA: University of Nebraska Press; Bishop, P.S., (2010) Dewey’s Pragmatism and the Great Community, , (Unpublished doctoral dissertation).

The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers’ “levees-only” policy—which joined disparate navigation and flood control interests—is largely blamed for the Great Flood of 1927, called the largest peacetime disaster in American history. River activists organized annual conventions, and later, professional lobbies organized media campaigns up and down the Mississippi River to sway public opinion and pressure Congress to fund flood control and river navigation projects. Annual river conventions drew thousands of delegates such as plantation owners, shippers, bankers, chambers of commerce, governors, congressmen, mayors and cabinet members with interests on the Mississippi River. Public pressure on Congress successfully captured millions of federal dollars to protect property, drain swamps for development, subsidize local levee districts and influence river policy. © 2018 by the author; licensee Cogitatio (Lisbon, Portugal).","Activism; Commerce; Democracy; Floods; Levees; Media; Media history; Mississippi river; River conventions",,,,,,,,,,"The Chicago Convention (1847) American Whig Review, 6 (2), pp. 111-122. , http://ebooks.library.cornell.edu/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=amwh;idno=amwh0006-2, August; Anderson, B., (1983) Imagined Communities: Reflections on the Origin and Spread of Nationalism, , London: Verso Books; Barry, J., (1997) Rising Tide: The Great Mississippi River Flood of 1927 and How It Changed America, , New York, NY: Simon & Schuster; Calhoun, J.C., (1846) Mr. Calhoun’s Report, , June 26, The Richmond Times; Calhoun, J.C., (1846) Mr. Calhoun Made the Following Report, p. 2. , August 5, The Mississippian; Colten, C., (2009) Perilous Place, Powerful Storms: Hurricane Protection in Coastal Louisiana, , Jackson, MS: University Press of Mississippi; Cotterill, R., (1919) Improvement of Transportation in the Mississippi Valley, , 1845–1850.

The intersection of democracy and media history brings together two impossibly expansive terms, so expansive that the articles herein cannot provide any meaningful closure to the questions that even a cursory consideration of media history and democracy would provoke. Instead of closure, what these authors develop is a demonstration of the value of media history to our understandings of democracy. Historical methods of inquiry are necessary components for any meaningful understanding of media or democracy, and the authors gathered here work from a multi-hued palette of historiographical approaches. One finds in this issue a careful attention to how issues related to media history and democracy can be investigated through consideration of intellectual history, the history of political debates, journalism history, and the history of media organizations and institutions. These articles make a strong case for the continued relevance of media history to understanding the democracy and the media. © 2018 by the author; licensee Cogitatio (Lisbon, Portugal).","Communication history; Democracy; Journalism; Media; Media history; Public",,,,,,,,,,"Anderson, J., From the Old New Republic to a Great Community: Insights and contradictions in John Dewey’s public pedagogy (2018) Media and Communication, 6 (1), pp. 34-42; Berger, J., (1972) Ways of Seeing, , London: British Broadcasting Corporation; Fonn, B.K., Approaching an abyss”: Liberalist Ideology in a Norwegian Cold War business paper (2018) Media and Communication, 6 (1), pp. 52-61; Maclennan, A.F., Private broadcasting and the path to radio broadcasting policy in Canada (2018) Media and Communication, 6 (1), pp. 13-20; Méndez-Muros, S., The media protest of neighbouring associations, promoter of citizen democratic culture during Transition in Southern Spain (2018) Media and Communication, 6 (1), pp. 62-72; Montalbano, K., Net neutrality, the Fairness Doctrine, and the NRB: The tension between United States religious expression and media regulation (2018) Media and Communication, 6 (1), pp. 5-12; Nerone, J., The future of communication history (2006) Critical Studies in Media Communication, 23 (3), pp. 254-262; Nerone, J., Does journalism history matter?

Since the conflict is newsworthy, we conduct a micro-social study of the neighbouring protest in the newspaper El Correo de Andalucía, published in the southern Spanish city of Seville. Through analysis of content, we study the informative flow and the repertoire of protest following a typology that distinguishes four formats (demonstrations, strikes, speeches and associations) divided into two levels of conflict. The analysis sample consists of 33 texts published between November 1975 (Franco’s death and the accession to the throne of Juan Carlos I) and June 1977 (the first democratic general elections). The main conclusion reveals that the newspaper becomes a platform that gives visibility to the neighbouring movement, normalising behaviours and procedure rules through the protest. © 2018 by the author; licensee Cogitatio (Lisbon, Portugal).","Civil society; Democratic culture; Local press; Media; Media history; Neighbouring movement; Spanish transition",,,,,,,,,,"Alonso, N., The neighbouring movements in Rome during the Italian protest cycle (1968–1976) (2011) Segle XX.

The Report of the Royal Commission on Radio Broadcasting in 1929 and American broadcasting both changed the direction of Canadian broadcasting, but were mitigated by the early, largely unregulated years. Broadcasters operated initially as small, independent, and local broadcasters, then, national networks developed in stages during the 1920s and 1930s. The late adoption of radio broadcasting policy to build a national network in Canada allowed other practices to take root in the wake of other examples, in particular, American commercial broadcasting. By 1929 when the Aird Report recommended a national network, the potential impact of the report was shaped by the path of early broadcasting and the shifts forced on Canada by American broadcasting and policy. Eventually Canada forged its own course that pulled in both directions, permitting both private commercial networks and public national networks. © 2018 by the author; licensee Cogitatio (Lisbon, Portugal).","America; Broadcasting; Canada; Commission; Frequencies; Media history; National; Networks; Radio; Religious",,,,,,"University of York

While the history of international telegraphy is typically written from a world-systems perspective, this article presents a key methodological critique of the use of collections spread across many institutions and colonies: archival satellites are not simply reducible to parts of a scattered whole, as archival collections are themselves curations of socially-positioned understandings of Empire. This is especially true of the “girdle round the world” that was British telegraphy. At a meta-historical level, individual archival collections of the global British telegraphy system can be read as histories of colonial administrators’ geographically- and socially- situated perspectives on Empire—namely through what archives have, and have not, preserved. I demonstrate how the documents about telegraphy collected and maintained in the Gibraltar National Archives reflect pre- and post-World War I English, anti-Liberal colonial administrators’ and military officials’ fear that privatization was an opening salvo against the democratic web that held the last vestiges of Empire together. © 2018 by the author; licensee Cogitatio (Lisbon, Portugal).","British empire; Colonial management; Historical methodology; Media archives; Media history; Telegraphy",,,,,,,,,,"Archer, E., (2006) Gibraltar, Identity, and Empire, , New York, NY: Routledge; Barty-King, H., (1980) Girdle round the Earth: History of “cable and wireless”, , London: William Heinemann Ltd; Broadberry, S., Harrison, M., (2009) The Economics of World War I (1St Ed.), , Cambridge: Cambridge University Press; Caruana, L., Rockoff, H., (2006) An Elephant in The Garden: The Allies, Spain, and Oil in World War II, , http://papers.nber.org/papers/w12228, National Bureau of Economic Research, NBER Working Paper No. 12228; Crisell, A., (2002) An Introductory History of British Broadcasting, , 2nd ed.).

Following an eventful history since 1918, Czechoslovakia changed in 1948 from a liberal democracy into a Communist regime. This had significant consequences for journalists and their national union and also for the International Organization of Journalists (IOJ), which had just established its headquarters in Prague. The second historical event to shake the political system was the “Prague Spring” of 1968 and its aftermath among journalists and their unions. The third landmark was the “Velvet Revolution” of 1989, which played a significant part in the fall of Communism in Central and Eastern Europe and led to the closing of the old Union of Journalists in 1990, followed by the founding of a new Syndicate which refused to serve as the host of the IOJ. This led to a gradual disintegration and the closing down of what in the 1980s was the world’s largest non-governmental organization in the media field. © 2017 by the authors.","Cold War; Communism; Czechoslovakia; International Organization of Journalists; Journalism; Union of journalists",,,,,,,,,,"Cebe, J., (2012) Novinářská organizace v letech 1945-1948 [Journalists organization 1945-1948], , Unpublished Doctoral dissertation).

The development of the Estonian journalists’ organization occurred as a sequence of transformations from the Estonian Journalists’ Association to the Estonian Journalists’ Union to the Soviet type journalists’ union, and lastly to an independent trade union. This sequence was disrupted by several fatal breakdowns that changed not only the character of the association, but also professional values, the whole occupational ideology and the conditions of the existence of journalism as a profession in Estonia. © 2017 by the author.","Estonian Journalists’ Organization; History; Journalists; Politics; Professional autonomy",,,,,,,,,,"Aru, K., (2008) Üks kirg, kolm mõõdet.

It further assumes that the exposure to EU related media content can influence the feeling of European identity. In order to verify this assumption, we combined the mere-exposure-theory and the hostile media phenomenon. We assume that these theoretical concepts could help to understand the influence of media on people’s levels of attachment to the EU. Regression analyses are performed on secondary data that were collected in a Eurobarometer survey in 2013. Our findings revealed that media exposure affected the respondents’ identification with Europe, as well as the modifications of this effect based on their assessments of EU media coverage. The results of the current study not only validate assumptions about the mere-exposure effects on identity but also confirm the theoretical assumption that perceived hostility reduces such effects, whereas exposure to information that is perceived as neutral promotes the effects of media exposure on the feeling of European identity. © 2017 by the authors.","Collective identity; European identity; Hostile media; Mere-exposure effect",,,,,,"Technische UniversitÃ¤t Ilmenau

It argues that there is a growing demand for personal data from China’s advertising, marketing, and credit reporting businesses. Meanwhile, the rapid development of the Internet, notably social media and e-commerce, has generated very large pools of personal data on digital platforms. These two factors contribute to the fast growth of both legitimate and illegitimate collection and exploitation of personal information. Chinese laws and regulations lag behind the market and are not ready to regulate personal data as a key economic resource. They scatter in a wide array of economic and social sectors and lack a coherent structure and effective enforcement mechanism. Unspecified overarching rationale, ambivalent market regulation, inadequate enforcement, as well as safety risks of governmental databases are problems that hinder the protection of personal data in China. The role and implications of the new Internet Security Law, entering into force in June 2017, remain to be seen. © 2017 by the author.","China; Credit analysis; E-commerce; Internet; Media law; Personal data; Privacy; Social media",,,,,,,,,,"Chen, J., Zhima Xinyong yazhu xiaofei (2015) Tengxin Zhengxin Jintie Jigou: Hulianwang Zhengxin Gezhan Suochang [Sesame Credit Focusing on Consumption Records, , http://finance.sina.com.cn/roll/20150825/080823054761.shtml, Tencent Credit working with financial institutions: Different strategies of Internet credit rating].

Using the framework of convergence culture as per the writings of Yochai Benkler, Henry Jenkins, Mark Deuze, and Axel Bruns, the impact of accessible and instantaneous image creation and dispersal are explored. Given the rise of consumer engagement in brand co-creation on social media platforms, we can observe massive changes to professional practice in areas such as aesthetics, and the erosion of previous sustainable business models. Indeed, as traditional notions of “expertise” shift from technological prowess to narrative and disseminative abilities, the effects on commercial practice and photographic education need to be addressed. This paper argues that there are three emerging priorities for commercial image use: narrative ability, authenticity, and subjectivity and suggests initial steps in their pedagogical application. By acknowledging these transformations, this paper explores the idea that students need to harness technique, social media influence, adaptability, subjectivity, and storytelling power in order to better serve emerging image-based needs in commercial spaces. © 2017 by the author; licensee Cogitatio (Lisbon, Portugal).","Brand co-creation; Commercial photography; Convergent culture; Instagram; Marketing; Post-secondary education; Social media; User generated content",,,,,,,,,,"Membership categories (2016) ASMP, , http://www.asmp.org/join/membership-categories, Retrieved from; Ahearn, M., 21 reasons to love photography now (2013) Photo District News, p. 46. , http://www.pdnonline.com/features/reasons-to-love-photography-now-part-1, June, Retrieved from; Banet-Weiser, S., Convergence on the street: Rethinking the authentic/commercial binary (2011) Cultural Studies, 25 (4-5), pp. 641-658; Banks, J., Deuze, M., Co-creative labour (2009) International Journal of Cultural Studies, 12 (5), pp. 419-431; Benkler, Y., (2006) The wealth of networks: How social production transforms markets and freedom, , New Haven, CT: Yale University Press; Berger, L., Snapshots, or: Visual culture’s clichés (2011) Photographies, 4 (2), pp. 175-190; Brabham, D.C., Crowdsourcing as a model for problem solving: An introduction and cases (2008) Convergence: The International Journal of Research into New Media Technologies, 14 (1), pp. 75-90; Bruns, A., (2008) Blogs, Wikipedia, Second Life, and beyond: From production to produsage, p. 45. , Bern: Peter Lang; Membership categories (2016) CAPIC, , http://capic.org/membership-categories/, Retrieved from; Chang, C.Y., (2014) Visualizing brand personality and personal branding: Case analysis on Starbucks and Nike’s brand value co-creation on Instagram, , Master Thesis).

Facing a massive decline in the circulation of newspapers and magazines over the past years, publishers have lost not only readers but also many advertisers. Thus, publishers are faced with both changed customer expectations as well as difficulty in generating profit. Users are increasingly less willing to pay for digital products and their expectations of digital content have changed: They would like to contribute their own content as well as to comment or share with others. Furthermore, advertisers can choose from a greater variety of options for placing adverts, particularly on social media and other online platforms. Therefore, many publishers struggle with the questions: How to earn money? What is the revenue model of the new business model? In order to determine the implications for publishers’ revenue models, we assume that advertising companies are going to play a prominent role in the new business model. Hence, this paper focuses on publishers’ services for advertising companies and therefore the expectations of advertisers towards publishers’ services. In particular, this preliminary qualitative study explores advertisers’ marketing interests in communities of readers who simultaneously contribute to discussions. Therefore, (1) a pre-study was conducted followed by (2) qualitative interviews with managers from advertising companies in Germany. Our initial findings confirm that advertisers could play an important role in the revenue model of publishers if they meet the expectations of advertisers who expressed their interest in both, using communities for customer research as well as interacting with users directly. The results also identify other possible services that publishers could offer advertisers in conjunction with addressing communities of contributing readers. © 2017 by the authors; licensee Cogitatio (Lisbon, Portugal).","Advertisers; Business model; Digitalization; Innovation; Publishers",,,,,,,,,,"Åkesson, M., (2009) Digital innovation in the value networks of newspapers., , Gothenburg: University of Gothenburg; Amit, R., Zott, C., Value creation in e-business (2001) Strategic Management Journal, 22 (6-7), pp. 493-520; Barnes, S., Hair, N.F., From banners to YouTube:Using the rearview mirror to look at the future of internet advertising (2009) International Journal of Internet Marketing and Advertising, 5 (3), pp. 223-239; Chesbrough, H., (2003) Open innovation: The new imperative for creating and profiting from technology., , Boston, MA: Harvard Business Review Press; Christensen, C., (2008) Disrupting class: How disruptive innovation will change the way the world learns, , New York, NY: McGraw Hill; Chyi, H.I., Paying for what?

The sharing of images is becoming an integral part of the social media experience today, and given that social media platforms are the prime locus for sociability—at least among young people in the West—this shift towards visuals arguably transforms how we relate to each other and the world around us, as well as how we perceive and construct our sense of self. For researchers, this raises conceptual, theoretical and methodological challenges. This thematic issue presents six articles as well as a book review on visual communication in social media focusing on developing a conceptual apparatus and precise definitions of objects and practices of study as well as contributions that address and discuss the methodological challenges as well as their potential solutions. The idea was to synergize research from a wide variety of communicationrelated disciplines on this rather new topic. © 2017 by the authors.","Facebook; Images; Instagram; Practices; Qualitative methods; Twitter; Visual communication; Visual social media",,,,,,,,,,"Barthes, R., Rhetoric of the image (1980) Classic Essays on Photography, pp. 269-285. , In A.

To understand the role of digital-networked images as a site for engaging in a personal and connective “visual” action that leads to formation of transient communities, the author analyzes the nude self-portrait of the young Egyptian woman Aliaa Magda Elmahdy, which during the Egyptian uprisings in 2011 drew attention across social media. As an object of analysis this image is a prime example of the use of digital-networked images in temporally intentional distribution, and as an instance of political enactment unique to this era. This article also explains the concept of participatory narratives as an ongoing process of meaning formation in the digital-networked image, shaped by the fluidity of the multiple and immediate textual narratives, visual derivatives, re-appropriation, and remixes contributed by other interested viewers. The online circulation of digital-networked images in fact culminates in a flow of ever-changing and overarching narratives, broadening the contextual scope around which images are traditionally viewed. © 2017 by the author.","Arab Spring; Feminist art; Online images; Political expression; Self-portrait; Selfies; Social media; Visual communication",,,,,,,,,,"(2011), https://twitter.com/amadshk/status/136096147461767168, November 14#Nude- PhotoRevolutionary or#NudePhotoDevaluationary?

Fifteen qualitative interviews were conducted with participants in an Instagram takeover project concerning their photographs. The study shows that adopting a communication strategy based on visual social media is dependent on the participants’ competencies and that it is embedded in everyday life. Moreover, the participants’ photographic practices were found to be influenced by social conventions, which resulted in the city being imagined differently by different participants. To use visual social media such as Instagram for branding purposes does not necessarily mean that novel images are generated, but that they are choreographed according to the conditions of Instagram as medium. © 2017 by the authors.","Instagram; Photography; Place branding; Practice; Social media; Strategic communication; Visual",,,,,,,,,,"Aronovitch, H., Interpreting Weber’s ideal types (2012) Philosophy of the Social Sciences, 42 (3), pp. 356-369; Braun, E., Kavaratzis, M., Zenker, S., My city— My brand: The different roles of residents in place branding (2013) Journal of Place Management and Development, 6 (1), pp. 18-28; Chalfen, R., (1987) Snapshot Versions of Life, , Bowling Green, OH: Popular Press; Chalfen, R., Snapshots “r” us: The evidentiary problematic of home media (2002) Visual Studies, 17 (1), pp. 141-149; Clark-Ibanez, M., Framing the social world with photo-elicitation interviews (2004) American Behavioral Scientists, 47 (12), pp. 1507-1527; De Certeau, M., (1984) The Practice of Everyday Life, , Berkeley, CA: University of California Press; Dinhopl, A., Gretzel, U., Selfie-taking as touristic looking (2016) Annals of Tourism Research, 57, pp. 126-139; Edensor, T., Performing tourism, staging tourism: (Re)producing tourist space and practice (2001) Tourist Studies, 1, pp. 59-81; Gomez Cruz, E., Lehmuskallio, A., (2016) Digital Photography and Everyday Life; Halkier, B., Methodological practicalities in analytic generalization (2011) Qualitative Inquiry, 17 (9), pp. 787-797; Kavaratzis, M., Cities and their brands: Lessons from corporate branding (2009) Place Branding and Public Diplomacy, 5 (1), pp. 26-37; Larsen, J., Practices and flows of digital photography: An ethnographic framework (2008) Mobilities, 3 (1), pp. 141-160; Orlikowski, W.J., Sociomaterial practices: Exploring technology at work (2007) Organization Studies, 28 (9), pp. 1435-1448; Pink, S., Amateur photographic practice, collective representation and the constitution of place (2011) Visual Studies, 26 (2), pp. 92-101; Postill, J., Introduction (2010) Theorising Media and Practice, pp. 1-26. , In B.

Based on a comprehensive visual analysis of 504 Instagram posts from Green-backed but independent presidential candidate Alexander Van der Bellen, who resulted as winner after almost one year of campaigning, this contribution reconstructs key aspects of digital storytelling on Instagram. By identifying relevant image types central to the self-representation of the candidate, this article shows how a politician makes use of a digital platform in order to project and manage desired images. The salience of image types allows for the reconstruction of underlying visual strategies: (1) the highlighting of the candidate’s biography (biographical strategy), (2) the presentation of his campaign team (team strategy), and (3) the presentation of the candidate as a legitimate office holder (incumbent strategy). The article thus sheds light on visual aspects of digital storytelling as relevant factor of political communication. © 2017 by the authors.","Digital platforms; Instagram; Political communication; Presidential election campaigns; Storytelling; Visual imagery; Visual strategies",,,,,,"Oesterreichische Nationalbank, OeNB","The article is based on results of a research project funded by the Anniversary Fund of the Austrian National Bank (“The Austrian Presidential Elections 2016: A Case Study in Visual Political Storytelling”; study period: February 2017–January 2019; project lead: Karin Lieb-hart, researcher: Petra Bernhardt).

The framework identifies practices, pictures and platforms as relevant dimensions of analysis. It is mainly developed within, and is compatible with qualitative, interpretive approaches which focus on visual communication as part of everyday personal communicative practices. Two screenshots from Instagram and Facebook are introduced as empirical examples to investigate collaborative practices of meaning-making relating to pictures on social media. While social media seems to augment reflexive, processual practices of negotiating identities, visual media, in particular, amps up aesthetic, ambivalent and embodied dimensions within these practices. © 2017 by the author.","Facebook; Iconography/iconology; Instagram; Internet research; Media practices; Practice theory; Qualitative research; Social media; Visual communication; Visual methods",,,,,,"Ãsterreichischen Akademie der Wissenschaften, ÃAW

Visuals and image-text relations in Tweets within #hongkongprotests revealed an application of images in clear favor of the protest movement taking an ‘at the scene’/‘on the ground’ perspective, with media workers being active in front of the camera rather than mere observers behind the camera.

I begin this article with a review of new materialist theory and methods broadly and specifically those that contribute insight into interviews and photo elicitation such as intra-views and posthuman visual methods. I then detail the research methodology I used for an empirical study conducted last year to look at what young women experience while taking selfies, or images of their face and body to be shared on social media. After this fairly procedural account, I return to my messy research notes and video recordings, and—rather than reread—I re-trace and re-matter-ialize one specific interview with one young woman using new materialist methods (intra-views and reading images horizontally) to reveal data that would otherwise not have been evidenced via my original humanist methods. Re-matter-ializing describes my process as a researcher re-visiting not only the discursive moments, but the affective encounters and the matter of the research assemblage; meaning I move beyond the spoken data to look at how the material-discursive-afffective assemblage or arrangment of the interview room, technologies of data recording, props in the room, and embodied interactions of the participants were entangled in and vital agents in the production of data. In conclusion I detail the benefits of a posthuman re-tracing: 1) an attentiveness to the complex human and non-human agents in a research assemblage, 2) a response-ability or ethical duty of researchers to not reduce the complexity of the phenomena they study, 3) the importance of affect in the research encounter especially in visual methods, and, 4) a questioning of the implicit assumption that—of all steps in a research program—methodology is the least malleable. © 2017 by the author.","Intra-view; New materialism; Photo elicitation; Posthumanism; Social media",,,,,,,,,,"Barad, K., (2007) Meeting the Universe Halfway (1St Ed.), , Durham, NC: Duke University Press; Baym, N., Senft, T., What does the selfie say?

In the context of communication power theory, this article investigates the effects of newspapers and social network sites on political participation and political power relations. The research employed a mixed methodology, comprised of a survey of 527 Egyptian youth and semi-structured interviews of 12 political activists and journalists. The results showed a significant relationship between reading newspapers and youth’s political participation, but not between using social network sites and political participation. In addition, newspapers and social network sites were platforms for a series of conflicts and coalitions that emerged between pro-and anti-revolution actors. Despite the importance of social network sites as key tools for informing and mobilizing the public, they eventually failed to empower new political actors, and this was because old actors, supported by newspapers and other mainstream media, managed to obstruct the new actors’ progress. © 2017 by the author.","Communication power; Egyptian newspapers; Egyptian political actors; Mediatization of politics; Political participation; Politicizing newspapers; Power relations; Social network sites",,,,,,,,,,"Abd Al-Samad, R., Taqrir: MosharaKat Almasryeen fi kafat alentkhabat wa Alestifitaat baad thawrat 25 yanayr [Report: Egyptian’s participation in all elections and referendums after the 25 January revolution] (2014) The Opinion, , http://arrai.org/pages.php?option=browse&id=122832, January 17; Abdulla, R., (2014) Egypt’s Media in the Midst of Revolution, , Washington, DC: Carnegie Endowment for International Peace; Alexander, A., Aouragh, M., Egypt’s unfinished revolution: The role of the media revisited (2014) International Journal of Communication, 8, pp. 809-915; Allam, R., Media landscape: Egypt (2010) European Journalism Centre, , http://ejc.net/media_landscapes/egypt; Almaskati, N.A., Newspaper coverage of the 2011 protests in Egypt (2012) International Communication Gazette, 74 (4), pp. 342-366; Anglim, J., Calculating composite scores of ability and other tests in SPSS (2009) Jeromy Anglim’s Blog: Psychology and Statistics, , http://jeromyanglim.blogspot.dk/2009/03/calculating-compositescores-of-ability.html; Aouragh, M., Social media, mediation and the Arab revolutions (2012) Triple C, 10 (2), pp. 518-536; Aouragh, M., Alexander, A., The Egyptian experience: Sense and nonsense of the Internet revolution (2012) International Journal of Communication, 5, pp. 1344-1358; Bakker, T.P., de Vreese, C.H., Good news for the future?

The contribution analyzes, grounded on an historic approach, the most competitive period in Switzerland, 2008, when not less than five freesheets were competing for advertisers and public attention. By using Altmeppen’s (2006) organizational theory, the paper offers a theoretical frame able to describe the vanishing co-orientation between the media management and the newsroom, a trend that aggravates commercialization processes in news organizations. In a situation of economic turmoil, so the hypothesis, newsrooms are more inclined to positively adapt the valence of their coverage about their main advertisers in order to keep them in the portfolio. Using a content analysis, the author examined the editorial coverage of six among the most important advertisers of Swiss free newspapers, carrying out an aggregated statistical analysis based on logistic regression. The study revealed that free newspapers with a strong market orientation display a higher chance to publish positive facts and evaluations about advertisers with a high advertising expenditure. © 2017 by the author.","Advertising; Commercialization; Free newspapers; Journalism; Media accountability",,,,,,,,,,"Altmeppen, K.-D., Journalismus und Medien als Organisationen (2006) Leistungen, Strukturen Und Management, , Wiesbaden: VS Verlag für Sozialwissenschaften; An, S., Bergen, L., Advertiser pressure on daily newspapers.

One of the mechanisms they use is content moderation, or the enforcement of which content is allowed or disallowed on the platform. Though content moderation relies on users’ labor to identify content to delete, users have little capacity to influence content policies or enforcement. Despite this, some social media users are turning to collective action campaigns, redirecting information flows by subverting the activities of moderators, raising the visibility of otherwise hidden moderation practices, and organizing constituencies in opposition to content policies. Drawing on the example of the campaign to change Facebook’s nudity policy, this paper examines the strategies and tactics of users turning to collective action, considering which factors are most influential in determining the success or failure of a campaign. It finds that network gatekeeping salience is a good model for assessing which collective action efforts are most likely to be effective in achieving individual user goals. This indicates that the users who are already most able to harness the attention economy of social media platforms are more likely to successfully navigate the content moderation process. The analysis concludes by attending to what users might learn from the dynamics of network gatekeeping as they seek to resist the asymmetrical power relations of platforms. © 2017 by the authors.","Collective action; Content moderation; Network gatekeeping; Platforms; Social media",,,,,,,,,,"Ammori, M., The “new” New York Times: Free speech lawyering in the age of Google and Twitter (2014) Harvard Law Review, 127 (8), pp. 2259-2295; Barrington, S., (2013) Facebook: Stop Censoring Photos of Men and Women Who have Undergone Mastectomies, , https://www.change.org/p/facebook-stop-censoring-photos-ofmen-and-women-who-have-undergone-mastectomies, Change.org; Barzilai-Nahon, K., Toward a theory of network gatekeeping: A framework for exploring information control (2008) Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology, 59 (9), pp. 1493-1512; Belkin, L., Censoring breastfeeding on Facebook (2008) The New York Times, , https://parenting.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/12/19/censoring-breastfeeding-on-facebook, December 19; Chemaly, S., FreeTheNipple: Facebook changes breastfeeding mothers photo policy (2014) The Huffington Post, , http://www.huffingtonpost.com/soraya-chemaly/freethenipplefacebook-changes_b_5473467.html, June 9; Corregan, S., Instagram breastfeeding fuss shows bias (2014) Times Colonist, , http://www.timescolonist.com/opinion/columnists/shannon-corregan-instagram-breastfeeding-fuss-shows-bias-1.1071948, May 23; Crawford, K., Can an algorithm be agonistic?

As a cultural field of practice, fanfiction questions prevalent concepts of individual authorship and proprietary of cultural goods. At the same time, fanfiction itself is challenged. Through processes of mediatization, fanfiction grew and became increasingly visible. Third parties, ranging from the media industry (e.g., film studios) and copyright holders to journalism and academia, are interested in fanfiction and are following its development. We regard fanfiction communities and fan acting as fields for experimentation and as discursive arenas which can help understand what appropriating, writing and publishing in a digital culture and the future of writing might look like. In this paper, we outline important debates on the legitimacy and nature of fanfiction and present preliminary results of current research within Germany. © 2017 by the authors.","Appropriation; Collective and distributed authorship; Commercialization; Copyright; Fanfiction; Gift culture",,,,,,"Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG

It is argued that—in times of mediated visibility, the increasing entanglement of social and technological change, and accelerated feedback loops—arenas of negotiation emerge and therewith the complexities of relations between producers and users increases. Using insights from the fields of Wii hacking, Circuit Bending, and online poker tools, three variants of interplay are presented and discussed: integration, segregation, and permanent confrontation. Whilst a process-oriented perspective on reciprocal action is developed the paper contributes (a) to a balanced perspective on what is often a onesided discussion regarding the actions leading to media change, and (b) to the understanding of the relation between media change and reflexive modernity. © 2017 by the authors.","Acting on media; Digital infrastructures; Feedback loop; Hacking; Interplay; Mediated construction of reality; Outlaw innovation; Reflexive modernity; Side-effects; Unmanageable consumer",,,,,,"UniversitÃ¤t Wien","The authors would like to thank the anonymous reviewers that contributed to the clarification of the arguments outlined in the paper.

This article contributes to advancing understanding of such media-focused activism through a case study of the World Forum of Free Media, a thematic forum for media activists and media advocacy organisations linked to the World Social Forum. Based on qualitative research conducted between 2008 and 2016—including participant observation, in-depth interviews and textual analysis—the article critically explores the extent to which the World Forum of Free Media can be considered a ‘free media’ movement in the making, and examines some of the challenges and contradictions that such a movement-building project entails. Drawing on social movement theory, specifically the concept of collective identity, it analyses efforts by forum organisers to mobilise a very diverse range of actors—from alternative media activists to policy- and advocacy NGOs—around a plural and inclusive ‘free media’ identity. While the World Forum of Free Media has to some extent succeeded in facilitating convergence around a set of core principles and ideas, it has so far struggled to develop a clear outwards-facing identity and mobilise a broad grassroots base. © 2017 by the authors.","Alternative media; Collective identity; Communication rights; FMML; Media activism; Media democracy movement; Social movements; World Forum of Free Media; World Social Forum",,,,,,"University of Westminster

Centralization is understood as the control over communication and data flows, and decentralization as giving it (back) to users. Communication and media research focuses on centralization put forward by dominant digital media platforms, such as Facebook and Google, and governments. Decentralization is investigated regarding its potential in civil society, i.e., hacktivism, (encryption) technologies, and grass-root technology movements. As content-based media companies increasingly engage with technology, they move into the focus of critical media studies. Moreover, as formerly nationally oriented companies now compete with global media platforms, they share several interests with civil society decentralization agents. Based on 26 qualitative interviews with leading media managers, we investigate (de)centralization strategies applied by content-oriented media companies. Theoretically, this perspective on media companies as agents of (de)centralization expands (de)centralization research beyond traditional democratic stakeholders by considering economic actors within the “global informational ecosystem” (Birkinbine, Gómez, & Wasko, 2017). We provide a three-dimensional framework to empirically investigate (de)centralization. From critical media studies, we borrow the (de)centralization of data and infrastructures, from media business research, the (de)centralization of content distribution. © 2017 by the authors.","Business models; Centralization; Content-oriented media companies; Decentralization; Digital media platforms; Distribution; Facebook; Google; Technology infrastructures",,,,,,"Austrian Science Fund, FWF

In Finland, the Finns Party (Perussuomalaiset) has been a constant promoter of organisational Euroscepticism through its leader, Timo Soini. The party broke through in Finland’s ‘big bang elections’ of 2011, when the most debated issue was the European economic crisis, which was dominated by Eurosceptic Soini. Research concerning the relationship between the media, populism and Euroscepticism usually focus on national or European Parliament elections. This study analyses the media portrayal of the Eurosceptic Finns Party during times other than elections, focusing on the Finland’s overall Euro crisis press coverage in 2010-2012. The analysis shows that the populist Finns Party has been a minor player in that coverage, which was dominated by the Euro positive political and economic elites. Differences between newspapers indicate that journalistic routines and political context direct media coverage toward particular framings, even when the media proclaims itself politically independent and neutral. © 2017 by the author; licensee Cogitatio (Lisbon, Portugal).","Euro crisis; Euroscepticism; Finland; Frame analysis; Media; Populism",,,,,,"Academy of Finland: 259393

Following the path to legalisation prior and after the Snowden disclosures of 2013, the article shows how post-Snowden controversies helped mobilise advocacy groups against the extra judicial surveillance of Internet communications, a policy area which had hitherto been overlooked by French human rights groups. It also points to the dilemma that post-Snowden contention created for governments. On the one hand, the disclosures helped document the growing gap between the existing legal framework and actual surveillance practices, exposing them to litigation and thereby reinforcing the rationale for legalisation. On the other hand, they made such a legislative reform politically risky and unpredictable. In France, policy-makers navigated these constraints through a cautious mix of silence, denials, and securitisation. After the Paris attacks of January 2015 and a hasty deliberation in Parliament, the Intelligence Act was passed, making it the most extensive piece of legislation ever adopted in France to regulate secret state surveillance. The article concludes by pointing to the paradoxical effect of post-Snowden contention: French law now provides for clear rules authorising large-scale surveillance, to a degree of detail that was hard to imagine just a few years ago. © 2017 by the author; licensee Cogitatio (Lisbon, Portugal).","Contentious politics; Intelligence; Internet; Securitisation; Snowden; Surveillance",,,,,,"Agence Nationale de la Recherche, ANR","This research was conducted for the UTIC project, supported by the French National Research Agency.",,,"(2013) Surveillance De l’Internet, accès Aux données d’utilisateurs: Pour Un Moratoire Sur Les régimes d’exception, , http://archive.is/firXs, March 18, Association des Sites Internet Communautaires; Benkler, Y., A free irresponsible press: Wikileaks and the battle over the soul of the networked fourth estate (2011) Harvard Civil Rights-Civil Liberties Law Review, 46 (2), pp. 311-397; Bigo, D., Carrera, S., Hernanz, N., Scherrer, A., (2014) National Security and Secret Evidence in Legislation and before the Courts: Exploring the Challenges, , http://www.europarl.europa.eu/thinktank/fr/document.html?reference=IPOL_STU%282014%29509991, (Report to the European Parliament’s Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs [LIBE] No. PE 509.991).

This article synthesizes existing research on Russia’s domestic information controls, its internet policy at the global level (notably via internet governance processes), and the country’s resurgence as a major geopolitical player to argue that policymakers as well as the general public should consider these themes holistically, particularly as they formulate responses to what many see as the Russian threat to Western liberal democracy. Russia may have lost the Cold War, but it is now waging information warfare against the liberal democracies of Europe and North America in a sophisticated bid to win the next round. Russia does not view internet governance, cybersecurity, and media policy as separate domains. Rather, all the areas covered by those disciplines fall under “information security” for Russian foreign policy. The paper begins by tracing the history of information controls within what is now the Russian Federation before discussing the role of information and internet policy in Russian foreign policy, drawing connections between the Russian government’s control and manipulation of information—including its internet policy—in the domestic and international arenas. Next, it discusses the spread of networked authoritarianism and suggests that a “geopolitics of information” will become increasingly necessary in the coming years. Just as networked authoritarianism establishes strategic infrastructures to control the message domestically and intervene in global media systems, liberal democracies need to rethink media and communication infrastructures to ensure they foster pluralist, rights-respecting societies that are resilient to authoritarianism and extremism. In doing so, they should resist the temptation to respond to this threat in ways that will erode democracy even further, such as expanded surveillance and limits on free expression. © 2017 by the author; licensee Cogitatio (Lisbon, Portugal).","2016 election; Censorship; Data localization; Human rights; Networked authoritarianism; Propaganda; Russia; Surveillance",,,,,,,,,,"(2016) #Keepiton, , https://www.accessnow.org/keepiton, Access Now; Bowles, A., The changing face of the RuNet (2006) Control + Shift.

The Clipper chip debate of 1993 and the FBI vs. Apple case of 2016 are analyzed to infer whether these discourses show similarities in their arguments and to draw lessons from them. The study is based on the securitization framework and analyzes the social construction of security threats in political discourses. The findings are that the arguments made by the proponents of exceptional access show major continuities between the two cases. In contrast, the arguments of the critics are more diverse. The critical arguments for stronger encryption remain highly relevant, especially in the context of the Snowden revelations. The article concludes that we need to adopt a more general cyber security perspective, considering the threat of cyber crime and state hacking, when debating whether the government should be able to weaken encryption. © 2017 by the author; licensee Cogitatio (Lisbon, Portugal).","Apple; Cryptowar; Discourse analysis; Encryption; FBI",,,,,,,,,,"Abelson, H., Erson, R., Bellovin, S.M., Benalo, J., Blaze, M., Diffie, W., Weitzner, D.J., (2015) Keys under Doormats: Mandating Insecurity by Requiring Government Access to All Data and Communications (Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory Technical Report, , MIT-CSAIL-TR-2015-026).

It is difficult not to see a clear connection with the Snowden leaks in the sharp acceleration of new national security legislations in Australia, a long term member of the Five Eyes Alliance. In October 2015, the Australian federal government passed controversial laws that require telecommunications companies to retain the metadata of their customers for a period of two years. The new acts pose serious threats for the profession of journalism as they enable government agencies to easily identify and pursue journalists’ sources. Bulk data collections of this type of information deter future whistleblowers from approaching journalists, making the performance of the latter’s democratic role a challenge. After situating this debate within the scholarly literature at the intersection between surveillance studies and communication studies, this article discusses the political context in which journalists are operating and working in Australia; assesses how metadata laws have affected journalism practices and addresses the possibility for resistance. © 2017 by the author; licensee Cogitatio (Lisbon, Portugal).","Digital resistance; Journalists; Metadata; Surveillance",,,,,,,,,,"Ananian-Welsh, R., Williams, G., New terrorists: The normalisation and spread of anti-terror laws in Australia (2014) The Melbourne University Law Review, 38, pp. 362-408; Andrejevic, M., The work of watching one another: Lateral surveillance, risk, and governance (2002) Surveillance & Society, 2 (4), pp. 479-497; Andrejevic, M., (2013) Infoglut: How Too Much Information is Changing the Way We Think and Know, , Oxford: Routledge; (2015) Ben Grubb and Telstra Corporation Limited, , http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/AICmr/2015/35.html; Bourdieu, P., The field of cultural production, or: The economic world reversed (1983) Poetics, 12 (4-5), pp. 311-356; Brandis, G., (2014) National Security Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2014, Second Reading, , http://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/parlInfo/search/display/display.w3p;db=CHAMBER;id=chamber%2Fhansards%2F232fa1a8-d7e8-4b22-9018-1a99b5a96812%2F0116;query=Id%3A%22chamber%2Fhansards%2F232fa1a8-d7e8-4b22-9018-1a99b5a96812%2F0173%22, Parliament of Australia; Brevini, B., WikiLeaks: Between disclosure and whistle-blowing in digital times (2017) Sociology Compass, 1 (3), pp. 1-11; Brevini, B., Murdock, G., Following the money: WikiLeaks and the political economy of disclosure (2013) Beyond Wikileaks: Implications for the Future of Communications, Journalism and Society, pp. 35-55. , In B.

But what role do companies themselves play in putting users’ privacy at risk? By comparing the changes in the privacy policies of ten companies—the nine in PRISM plus Twitter—I seek to understand how users’ privacy shifted. Specifically, I study how company practices surrounding the life cycle of user information (e.g. collection, use, sharing, and retention) shifted between the times when companies joined PRISM and when PRISM news broke. A qualitative analysis of the changes in the privacy policies suggests that company disclosure of tracking for advertising purposes increased. I draw on business scholar Shoshana Zuboff’s conceptualization of “surveillance capitalism” and legal scholar Joel Reidenberg’s “transparent citizen” to explain the implications such changes hold for users’ privacy. These findings underscore why public debates about post-Snowden privacy rights cannot ignore the role that companies play in legitimizing surveillance activities under the auspices of creating market value. © 2017 by the author; licensee Cogitatio (Lisbon, Portugal).","Internet companies; PRISM; Privacy policies; Surveillance capitalism; Targeted advertising; Transparent citizen",,,,,,,,,,"Bellia, P.L., The memory gap in surveillance law (2008) University of Chicago Law Review, 75, pp. 137-179; Blodget, H., The Washington Post has now hedged its stunning claim about Google, Facebook, etc, giving the government direct access to their servers (2013) Business Insider, , http://www.businessinsider.com/washington-post-updates-spying-story-2013-6, June 7; Butler, J., Granick, J.S., Correcting the record on section 702: A prerequisite for meaningful surveillance reform (2016) Just Security, , https://www.justsecurity.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Butler-Granick-Correcting-the-Record-Scope-of-702.pdf; Gallagher, R., Hager, N., In bungled spying operation, NSA targeted pro-democracy campaigner (2016) The Intercept, , https://theintercept.com/2016/08/14/nsa-gcsb-prism-surveillance-fullman-fiji, August 14; Gellman, B., Poitras, L., U.S., British intelligence mining data from nine U.S. (2013) Internet Companies in Broad Secret Program, , https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/us-intelligence-mining-data-from-nine-us-internet-companies-in-broad-secret-program/2013/06/06/3a0c0da8-cebf-11e2-8845-d970ccb04497_story.html, June 7, The Washington Post; Jeong, S., (2016) The History of Twitter’s Rules.

This holds particularly true for privacy-sensitive communities in Germany. However, while the public was outraged, intelligence and security cooperation between the United States and Germany has been marked by continuity instead of disruption. The rather insubstantial debate over a so-called “No-Spy-Agreement” between the United States and Germany is just one telling example of the disconnect between public discourse and governmental action, as is the recent intelligence service regulation. This article considers why and where the “Snowden effect” has been lost on different discursive levels. We analyze and compare parliamentary and governmental discourses in the two years after the Snowden revelations by using the Sociology of Knowledge Approach to Discourse (SKAD) to dissect the groupspecific statements and interpretive schemes in 287 official documents by the German Bundestag, selected ministries and agencies within the policy subsystem.

They do so rooted in institutional frameworks where traditional conceptualizations of television still persist. In this context, we reflect on the role of the national television archive as an agent of historical knowledge in the convergence era. Contextualisation and infrastructure function as important preconditions for users of archives to find their way through the enormous amounts of audio-visual material. Specifically, we consider the case of the Netherlands Institute for Sound and Vision, taking a critical stance towards the archive’s practices of contextualisation and preservation of audio-visual footage in the convergence era. To do so, this article considers the impact of online circulation, contextualisation and preservation of audio-visual materials in relation to, first, how media policy complicates the re-use of material, and second, the archive’s use by television professionals and media researchers. This article reflects on the possibilities for and benefits of systematic archiving, developments in web archiving, and accessibility of production and contextual documentation of public broadcasters in the Netherlands. We do so based on an analysis of internal documentation, best practices of archive-based history programmes and their related cross-media practices, as well as media policy documentation. We consider how audio-visual archives should deal with the shift towards multi-platform productions, and argue for both a more systematic archiving of production and contextual documentation in the Netherlands, and for media researchers who draw upon archival resources to show a greater awareness of an archive’s history. In the digital age, even more people are part of the archive’s processes of selection and aggregation, affecting how the past is preserved through audio-visual images. © 2016 by the authors; licensee Cogitatio (Lisbon, Portugal).","Archival footage; Broadcasting; Convergence; Cross-media; Digital media; History programming; Media policy; Online circulation; Preservation and contextualization practices; Production research documentation",,,,,,,,,,"Baltussen, L.B., Blom, J., Medjoune, L., Pop, R., Van Gorp, J., Huurdeman, H., Haaijer, L., Hard content, fab front-end: Archiving websites of Dutch public broadcasters (2014) Alexandria: The Journal of National and International Library and Information Issues, 25 (1-2), pp. 69-91; Baltussen, L.B., Verbruggen, E., Jansen, B., Oomen, J., Freiburg, B., Van De Kar, L., Na de Bevrijding XL: Expanding a historical television series with archival sources (2014) Beeld En Geluid, , https://www.beeldengeluid.nl/en/blogs/research-amp-development-en/201408/linked-media-audiovisual-domain-na-de-bevrijding-xl-lime; Bryant, S., National television archives and their role (2010) Critical Studies in Television: The International Journal of Television Studies, 5 (2), pp. 60-67; Caldwell, J.T., Cultures of production: Studying industry’s deep texts, reflexive rituals, and managed self-disclosures (2009) Media Industries: History, Theory, and Method, pp. 199-212. , J.

This article explores two recent articulations of the concept of television that have motivated ‘end of television’ narratives in the two countries. One is future-oriented – the introduction of online subscription video services from local providers like Fetch TV, Presto, Stan and from March 2015, the international giant Netflix. It draws on a survey of senior people in TV, technology, advertising, production, audience measurement and social media conducted in late 2014 and early 2015. The other is recent history – the switchover from analogue to digital terrestrial television, completed in both countries in December 2013. Digital TV switchover was a global policy implemented in markedly different ways. Television was transformed, though not in the precise ways anticipated. Rather than being in the center of the digital revolution, as the digital TV industry and policy pioneers enthused, broadcast television was, to some extent, overrun by it. The most successful online subscription video service in Australia and New Zealand so far, Netflix, talks up the end of television but serves up a very specific form of it. The article poses a slightly different question to whether or not television is ending: that is, whether, in the post-broadcast, digital era, distinctions between unique TV systems and practices will endure, narrow, dissolve, or morph into new forms of difference. © 2016 by the author; licensee Cogitatio (Lisbon, Portugal).","Digital switchover; Digital television; Netflix; Subscription video; SVOD; Television; Video",,,,,,"Australian Research Council, ARC

There is currently widespread debate about the future of television and the impact of technological and market changes. Our argument is that the answer to what is happening to television cannot be adequately addressed on a general level; local and contextual factors are still important, and so is the position and strategic response of existing television institutions in each national context. Based on analyses of political documents, statistics, audience research and media coverage, as well as secondary literature, the article explores the current situation for Norwegian television and point to four contexts that each plays a part in constraining and enabling existing television operators: the European context, the public service context, the welfare state context and the media ecosystem context. © 2016 by the author; licensee Cogitatio (Lisbon, Portugal).","Convergence; Norway; Public service broadcasting; Television",,,,,,,,,,"Aslama, M., Syvertsen, T., Public service broadcasting and new technologies: Marginalisation or re-monopolisation (2007) Media between Culture and Commerce, 4, pp. 167-178; Aune, O., (2015) Mens Vi Slo Hverandre I Hodet, Tok Netflix 500 000 Norske Abonnenter.

For audiences, this has not only opened up multiple opportunities to watch television content at other times and on other devices, but also to interact with its cross-media extensions. However, while much has been written about the new opportunities for audience engagement, we do not know much about the actual adoption of new technologies nor the motivations underlying such uses. Therefore, this paper draws on empirical audience research to address the key question: how do viewers engage with contemporary TV fiction? Through empirical audience research, using various qualitative research methods, three different aspects of the reception of cross-media TV fiction will be discussed: (1) how do viewers watch the TV episodes of contemporary TV fiction?, (2) how do viewers engage with the cross-media extensions of TV fiction?, and (3) how do viewers experience the social dimensions of contemporary TV fiction? We focus on a particular group, that of 'engaged' viewers, who are actively involved by personalizing their viewing practices, by communicating about it, by consuming cross-media elements of TV fiction, or producing TV fiction-related content. Our findings suggest that even this group does not make full use of all the available technological opportunities to personalize TV viewing, and that the classical TV text, linear viewing, and the social aspect of viewing remain of key importance. © 2016 by the authors; licensee Cogitatio (Lisbon, Portugal).","Cross-media; Flanders; In-depth interviews; TV fiction; TV viewing",,,,,,,,,,"Aronson, J.E., Reddy, S.K., Stam, A., SPOT: Scheduling programs optimally for television (1998) Management Science, 44 (1), pp. 83-102; Askwith, I.D., (2007) Television 2.0: Reconceptualizing TV as an Engagement Medium, , Master Thesis).

The internet, as convergent carrier medium, is increasingly taking on a central role for additional media. Classical linear TV is still important, but for some audiences it has been developing from a primary medium to a secondary medium. Owing to the growing melding of classical-linear TV contents with online offerings (e.g. video-on-demand platforms or Web–TV), a great dynamic can be seen which has triggered numerous discussions about the future of TV for some time now. This article will summarize the results of two different audience studies. Film and television shows are meanwhile distributed online via Video-on-Demand platforms such as Netflix or Amazon Prime Video. The first audience study has dealt with the use of VoD-platforms in Germany investigating user rituals, user motivation to watch films and TV shows on these platforms, and the meaning of VoD in everyday life. Most of the participants in this study reported that they mainly watch TV drama series at Netflix or Amazon Prime. Therefore, the second audience study focused the online use of television drama series of individuals and couples elaborating the phenomenon of binge watching. In relating the audience practice to the new structures of the television market the article will shed light on the future of television. © 2016 by the author; licensee Cogitatio (Lisbon, Portugal).","Audiences; Binge watching; Convergence; Digitalization; Television; Television culture; Television series; Video-on-demand",,,,,,,,,,"Bolin, G., The death of the mass audience reconsidered.

For quite a while, the mobile phone was considered to be a disturbance both for watching television and for classroom teaching. In recent years, however, strategies have been developed to turn the second screen’s distractive potential into a source for intensified, personalized and social attention. This has consequences for television’s position in a multimedia assemblage: television’s alleged speci-ficities (e.g. liveness) become mouldable features, which are selectively applied to guide the attention of users across different devices and platforms. Television does not end, but some of its traditional features do only persist because of its strategic complementarity with other media; others are re-adapted by new technologies thereby spreading televisual modes of attention across multiple screens. The article delineates the historical development of simultaneous media use as a ‘problematization’—from alternating (and competitive) media use to multitasking and finally complementary use of different media. Additionally, it shows how similar strategies of managing attention are applied in the ‘digital classroom’. While deliberately avoiding to pin down, what television is, the analysis of the problem of attention allows for tracing how old and new media features are constantly reshuffled. This article combines three arguments: (1) the second screen is conceived of as both a danger to attention and a tool to manage attention. (2) To organize attention, the second screen assemblage modulates the specific qualities of television and all the other devices involved. (3) While being a fragile and often inconsistent assemblage, the second screen spreads its dynamics—and especially the problem of attention—far beyond television, e.g. into the realm of teaching. © 2016 by the author; licensee Cogitatio (Lisbon, Portugal).","Assemblage; E-learning; Economy of attention; Liveness; Second screen; Television",,,,,,,,,,"(2014) Volkswagen: Eyes on the Road, , https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R22WNkYKeo8, Retrieved from; Agamben, G., (2009) What is an apparatus?” and Other Essays, , Stanford, CA: Stanford University Press; Altman, R., Television sound (1986) Studies in Entertainment: Critical Approaches to Mass Culture, pp. 39-54. , T.

Advertising investment in TV continues to increase, governments still use television to promote generalized propaganda as well as their daily agendas, football on screen remains wildly popular, and fiction programs, most notably telenovelas, dominate prime time and draw large audiences aged between 25 and 60. While younger viewers watch television on a wider variety of screens and technologies, and do so at differing times, the discourse of TV remains an important referent in their audiovisual experiences. In addition, across age groups, divides persist between a minority with routine high-quality access to the digital world of technology and information and a majority without alternatives to the traditional audiovisual sphere, for whom cell phones, for instance, are at most devices for communicating with friends and family members. We cannot predict the future of TV in Latin America—but we can say with confidence that the claims for its demise are overstated.

From DVRs, to Netflix, to HBO Now, consumers have never before had such control over how they consume televisual content. The rapid changes to the medium have led to rhetoric heralding the impending “post-TV era.” Looking at the ways that legacy television companies have adapted to new technologies and cultural practices suggests that rather than traditional television going the way of radio, television as a medium is actually not terribly different, at least not enough to conclude that we have entered a new era. Press releases, discursive practices by the news media, corporate structures and investments, and audience research all point to the rhetoric of post-TV as being overblown. By thinking about contemporary television as being in transition, greater emphasis and attention can be placed on the role that major media conglomerates play in developing, funding, and legitimizing new forms of television distribution, in addition to co-opting disruptive technologies and business models while hindering others. © 2016 by the author; licensee Cogitatio (Lisbon, Portugal).","Convergence; Hulu; Netflix; Networks; Over-the-top; Streaming; Television",,,,,,,,,,"Anderson, A., Rolfe, P., The challenges Netflix faces during Southern Europe expansion (2015) The Hollywood Reporter, , http://www.hollywoodreporter.com, June 8; Armental, M., Ramachandran, S., Netflix subscriber growth disappoints in US (2015) The Wall Street Journal, , http://www.wsj.com, October 14); Brodkin, J., Comcast spent $336 million on failed attempt to buy Time Warner Cable (2015) Ars Technica, , http://www.arstechnica.com, May 4, Retrieved from; Burkart, P., McCourt, T., (2006) Digital Music Wars: Ownership and Control of the Celestial Jukebox, , New York: Rowman & Littlefield; Caldwell, J., Convergence television: Aggregating form and repurposing content in the culture of conglomeration (2004) Television after TV: Essays on a Medium in Transition, pp. 41-74. , L.

The spaces from which television has been taken seriously as a topic of investigation have enabled a neglect of empirical and theoretical research that genuinely engages with the ways in which television might be understood as variously surviving, growing, innovating and even leading the current and future global media landscapes. The paper offers two ways in which television scholars might productively re-locate their spheres of concentration to understand the diversity of television worlds today: 1) empirically, it considers the case of the Philippines where broadcast television is successful in ways that could only be dreamed of by television executives in the so-called ‘world centres’ of the global entertainment industry. 2) theoretically, the paper refers to complementary attempts in sociology, literary and cultural studies to offer alternatives to Europe and North America from which scholars might locate the vanguard for modernity, globalization and innovation. It is by engaging with both of these strands in concert—empirically investigating television beyond the ‘usual places’ in such a way that responds to the call of cultural theorists to question our very assumptions about where television studies’ ‘usual places’ should be, that more nuanced understandings, and fewer premature declarations, might be made about what television is, and where it is going. © 2016 by the author; licensee Cogitatio (Lisbon, Portugal).","Entertainment television; Philippines; Social media; Television studies",,,,,,"Australian Research Council, ARC: DP110100075

This case demonstrates that, while the adoption of new media has not proven to be the final assault in a Faustian bargain with modernity, media makers face a number of significant challenges and dilemmas, specifically curating, archiving, and also securing and sustaining financial and technological support. Partnerships and collaborations are essential but their often-precarious nature presents difficulties. Dedication, persistence, creativity and adaptability are assets community members draw upon in responding to challenges. Media makers are increasingly gaining more control and are now training the next generation of youths; young people are using new social media, as well as video and film, to achieve greater representational sovereignty. © 2016 by the author; licensee Cogitatio (Lisbon, Portugal).","A’uwẽ-Xavante; Brazil; Gender; Indigenous media; Native amazonia",,,,,,,,,,"(2004) American Anthropological Association Statement on Ethnography and Institutional Review Boards, , http://www.americananthro.org/ParticipateAndAdvocate/Content.aspx?ItemNumber=1652, Retrieved from; Aufderheide, P., The video in the villages project: Video making with and by Brazilian Indians (1995) Visual Anthropology Review, 11 (2), pp. 83-93; Aytai, D., (1985) O Mundo Sonoro Xavante.

Using Canada’s #IdleNoMore movement as a case, this study uses framing theory to better understand how traditional media are representing activism borne of social media such as Twitter, and how such activism can ultimately have an impact in political and public policy debates. A qualitative framing analysis is used to identify frames present in media reporting of #IdleNoMore during its first two months by two prominent Canadian publications. Emergent frames show that hashtag activism as a catalyst for a social movement was embraced as a theme by one of the publications, therefore helping to legitimize the role of social media tools such as Twitter. In other frames, both positive and negative depictions of the social movement helped to identify for mainstream audiences both historical grievances and future challenges and opportunities for Canada’s First Nations communities. © 2016 by the author; licensee Cogitatio (Lisbon, Portugal).","Media framing; Online activism; Social media",,,,,,,,,,"Altheide, D., (1996) Qualitative Media Analysis, , Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage; (2009) Why Do People Really Tweet?

Previous research has primarily examined whether or not the use of social media endangers or strengthens armed forces’ strategic narrative. We examine armed forces’ perceptions of risks and opportunities on a broad basis, with a particular focus on areas of deployment. The article is based on a survey of perceptions of social media amongst the armed forces of EU member states, thus adding to previous research through its comparative perspective. Whereas previous research has mainly focused on larger powers, such as the US and the UK, this article includes the views of the armed forces of 26 EU states, including several smaller nations. In analyzing the results we asked whether or not risk and opportunity perceptions were related to national ICT maturity and the existence of a social media strategy. The analysis shows that perceptions of opportunities outweigh perceptions of risks, with marketing and two-way communication as the two most promi-nent opportunities offered by the use of social media. Also, armed forces in countries with a moderate to high ICT ma-turity emphasize social media as a good way for marketing purposes. © 2016 by the authors; licensee Cogitatio (Lisbon, Portugal).","Armed forces; EU; International deployments; Social media",,,,,,,,,,"Anden-Papadopoulos, K., (2009) US Soldiers Imaging the Iraq War on Youtube, 7, pp. 17-27. , Popular Communication; Bennett, D., Exploring the impact of an evolving war and terror blogosphere on traditional media coverage of conflict (2013) Media, War & Conflict, 6 (1), pp. 37-53; Bertot, J.C., Jaeger, P.T., Grimes, J.M., Using ICTs to create a culture of transparency: E- government and social media as openness and anticorruption tools for societies (2010) Government Information Quarterly, 27 (3), pp. 264-271; Betz, D., The virtual dimension of contemporary insurgency and counterinsurgency (2008) Small Wars & Insurgencies, 19 (4), pp. 510-540; Bjerg Jensen, R., British military media strategies in modern wars (2011) Global Media and Communication, 7, pp. 193-197; Bjerg Jensen, R., (2014) Managing Perceptions: Strategic Communication and the Story of Success in Libya, pp. 171-194. , K.

Less attention has been paid to the news media’s role in mitigating conflict. Criticism has been directed towards the ways in which journalists and war correspondents cover conflict with an emphasis on violence, suffering, polarization of the views of main stakeholders, and over-simplification of the underlying causes of conflict. The growing literature and scholarship around Peace Journalism stands as a response to this. In the context of the African continent, further critique has been levelled against frames and narratives of war, conflict and violence grounded in Western epistemologies and dominant discourses of African conflicts and stakeholders. Based on data collected from interviews with a selected group of journalists working on-and covering-the African continent, the article assesses awareness towards alternative narratives and news frames, as well as attitudes towards alternative practices and models for journalism. Particular attention is paid to ideas and responses regarding Peace Journalism as an alternative model for reporting. © 2016 by the author; licensee Cogitatio (Lisbon, Portugal).","Africa; Foreign reporting; Peace journalism; War journalism",,,,,,,,,,"Allan, S., Documenting war, visualising peace: Towards peace photography (2011) Expanding Peace Journalism: Comparative and Critical Approaches, , I.

While such censorship practices were traditionally aimed at broadcast and print media, the emergence of the Internet and social media in particular, prompted some authoritarian regimes, such as the Assad regime in Syria, to try and exert a similar lev-el of censorship on the Internet as well. During the Arab Spring, the Syrian regime blocked hundreds of websites that provided social networking, news, and other services. Taking Syria as a case study, this paper examines whether Internet censorship succeeded in preventing Internet users from reaching censored online content during 2010−2012. By analyzing the use of Alkasir, a censorship circumvention tool created by the author, the paper provides empirical evidence demonstrating that users were in fact able to bypass censorship and access blocked websites. The findings demonstrate that censor-ship circumvention tools constituted a threat to the information control systems of authoritarian regimes, highlighting the potential of such tools to promote online freedom of expression in countries where Internet censorship is prevalent. © 2016 by the author; licensee Cogitatio (Lisbon, Portugal).","Alkasir; Arab Spring; Conflict; Democracy; Freedom of expression; Internet censorship circumvention; Syria",,,,,,,,,,"(2011) Syrian Colonel Claims Big Defection, , http://www.news24.com/World/News/Syrian-colonel-claims-big-defection-20110730, AFP, News24; Al-Obaidi, J., (2007) Media Censorship in the Middle East, , New York: Edwin Mellen Press; Al-Saqaf, W., (2014) Breaking Digital Firewalls.

We focus on content analysis of posts and comments on a Facebook page named “Tweeting Arabs” which was established and is administered by Pales-tinian citizens of Israel. This page states that its’ main goal is to publicize opinions, thoughts and beliefs of Palestinians, enabling the moderate voice to be heard and encouraging dialogue between Israeli-Jews and Palestinians. The analysis is based on a data set containing posts and comments collected from “Tweeting Arabs” since the page was founded in November 8th 2014 and until December 4th 2014. This data set contains 85 posts which gained a total of 9657 “likes”, and 461 “shares”, as well as 3565 comments and replies to these posts. Our findings reveal that while posts that pre-sented the narrative of Palestinian suffering were mostly followed by negative comments from Israeli-Jews, posts that brought up the Palestinian moderate and peace seeking voice elicited higher Jewish–Israeli acceptance and sympathy. The research adds to our understanding of Facebook as a dialogue provoking platform that enables users from different ethnopolitical groups in divided and conflicted societies to perform peacebuilding actions. © 2016 by the authors; licensee Cogitatio (Lisbon, Portugal).","Contact theory; Intergroup dialogue; Narrative model; Peacebuilding; Reconciliation; Social media",,,,,,,,,,"Abu-Nimer, M., (1999) Dialogue, Conflict Resolution, and Change: Arab-Jewish Encounters in Israel, , Albany, NY: State University of New York Press; Adwan, S., Bar-On, D., Shared history project: A PRIME example of peacebuilding under fire (2004) International Journal of Politics, Culture and Society, 17, pp. 513-521; Ai Ramiah, A., Hewstone, M., (2013) Intergroup contact as a tool for reducing, resolving, and preventing intergroup conflict: Evidence, limitations and potential, pp. 527-542; Allport, G.W., (1954) The Nature of Prejudice, , Reading MA: Addison-Wesley; Amichai-Hamburger, Y., McKenna, Κ.Y.A., The Contact Hypothesis reconsidered: Interacting via the Internet (2006) Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication, 11 (3), pp. 825-843; Bar-On, D., (2006) Tell Your Life-Story: Creating Dialogue between Jews and Germans, Israelis and Palestinians, , Beer-Sheva: Ben-Gurion University in the Negev Press; Bar-On, D., (2008) The Others within Us: Constructing Jewish-Lsraeli Identity, , New York: Cambridge University Press; Bar-On, D., Storytelling and multiple narratives in conflict situations: From the TRT group in the German-Jewish context to the dual-narrative approach of PRIME (2009) Handbook on Peace Education, pp. 199-212. , G.

What is the significance of Ta’ayush’s work on the ground and online for peace? This article considers the former in the light of social movement scholarship on peacebuilding, and the latter in light of new media scholar-ship on social movements. Each of those approaches suggest that Ta’ayush has very limited success in achieving its strategic goals or generating outrage about the Occupation in the virtual/public sphere. Yet, Ta’ayush’s apparent “fail-ure” according to standard criteria of success misses the significance of Ta’ayush’s work. Its combination of grassroots activism and online documentation of its work in confronting the Occupation in partnership with Palestinians has assembled an impressive archive. Through the lens of Walter Benjamin’s philosophy of history, Ta’ayush can be seen to enact a “future perfect” peace that will have come. © 2016 by the author; licensee Cogitatio (Lisbon, Portugal).","Archive; Israel; Media activism; New media; Palestine; Peace activism; Social media; Ta’ayush; Umm el-Arayes; Walter Benjamin",,,,,,,,,,"Ascherman, A., Interview with Arik Ascherman (2009) Just Vision, , http://www.justvision.org/portrait/847/interview; Azoulay, A., Flanders, E., The right to share the public archive: A conversation about Ariella Azoulay's different ways not to say deportation (2012) Fillip, 16, pp. 16-19; Badawi, K., Interview with Khulood Badawi (2005) Just Vision, , http://www.justvision.org/portrait/833/interview; Benjamin, W., Theses on the philosophy of history (1968) Illuminations, , H.

According to them, the transformation of the conflict is immanent to the conflict itself. The claim of ECT theorists is that classical conflict resolution has mostly aimed at overcoming a conflict by means of neutral mediation, while conflict transformation is not primarily concerned with terminating a conflict and considers the conflict worker as part of the conflict system. Although ECT is a communication-based model of conflict management and relies on human media, its media-theoretical aspects are not made explicit, raising the question of what role technological media play in the communicative processes that make up ECT techniques. Through an examination of the claimed differences between conflict resolution and conflict transformation, and focusing on the common roots of new media and the elicitive model in systems and cybernetic theory, this paper asks whether any peace-building potential of new media could be found in a specific anti-propagandistic quality of distributed technological media. It concludes by looking at any such potential in social media. © 2016 by the author; licensee Cogitatio (Lisbon, Portugal).","Conflict resolution; Elicitive conflict transformation; New media theory; Peace media; Peacebuilding",,,,,,,,,,"Banning, M., (2016), Sharing entanglements.

This paper endorses the argument that with the help of new media technologies, journalists can enhance the peacebuilding efforts in societies and communities. Their writings in the alternate media can provide ‘compelling form of engagement’ between the audiences and the people affected in the areas of violent conflict. But, the paper further argues, this requires a broadening of the orthodox model of journalistic objectivity that has so far been in place. It examines the possibilities of new models in the light of the existing journalism paradigms as argued by scholars including Galtung and Ruge (1965), Lynch and McGoldrick (2005), Shinar (2007), Hackett (2011) and Shaw (2011). It concludes on the need to have a model that is ‘a more natural fit’ for the 21st century by giving journalists the ‘flexibility’ to enable people to make their own judgments as to where the truth lies; and to open up the possibilities for dialogue and engagement in conflict resolution. © 2016 by the author; licensee Cogitatio (Lisbon, Portugal).","Alternate media; Challenger paradigm; Conflict resolution; New journalism models; Peace journalism; Peacebuilding; Social media",,,,,,,,,,"Alia, V., Crossing borders: The global influence of indigenous media (2010) Peace Journalism, War and Conflict Resolution, pp. 121-138. , R.

First, digital media destabilize long-held assumptions about the nature of collective action, about social movements and their capacity to effect change. This is because digital media are thought to facilitate more decentralized, dispersed, temporary and individualized forms of political action that subvert the notion of the collective as singular, unified, homogeneous, coherent, and mass. One way of resolving this challenge is to view the collective in looser terms, as a process rather than as a finished product, a conceptualization that can be influence our understanding not only of social movements, but also of other political actors and of society as a whole. Second, digital media highlight the need to take communication seriously in how we conceptualize both collective action and political agency. Placing communication at the centre allows us to develop this looser and more processual understanding of the collective by studying it as a process that is constituted in and through communication. Inspired by organizational communication and particularly the work of Taylor and van Every (2000), this essay proposes a conception of collective action as emerging in conversations and solidified in texts. This conceptualization allows for a more multiplex and variegated view of political agency that takes into account the specific context where agency is exercised and the power that different actors can exert in a communicative process of negotiation, persuasion and claim-making. © 2016 by the author; licensee Cogitatio (Lisbon, Portugal).","Collective action; Communication; Digital media; Political agency; Social media; Social movement",,,,,,,,,,"Bakardjieva, M., Do clouds have politics?

Taking as its case study the state-sponsored campaign to formally recognise Indigenous people in the Australian constitution, the article examines the interrelationships between political media and Indigenous participatory media—both of which we argue are undergoing seismic transformation. Discussion of constitutional reform has tended to focus on debates occurring in forums of influence such as party politics and news media that privilege the voices of only a few high-profile Indigenous media ‘stars’. Debate has progressed on the assumption that constitutional change needs to be settled by political elites and then explained and ‘sold’ to Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians. Our research on the mediatisation of policymaking has found that in an increasingly media-saturated environment, political leaders and their policy bureaucrats attend to a narrow range of highly publicised voices. But the rapidly changing media environment has disrupted the media-driven Recognise campaign. Vigorous public discussion is increasingly taking place outside the mainstream institutions of media and politics, while social media campaigns emerge in rapid response to government decisions. Drawing on a long tradition in citizens’ media scholarship we argue that the vibrant, diverse and growing Indigenous media sphere in Australia has increased the accessibility of Indigenous voices challenging the scope and substance of the recognition debate. The article concludes on a cautionary note by considering some tensions in the promise of the changing media for Indigenous participation in the national policy conversation. © 2016 by the authors; licensee Cogitatio (Lisbon, Portugal).","Indigenous constitutional recognition; Indigenous media; Mediatisation; Participation; Political communication",,,,,,"Australian Research Council, ARC: FT140100515","We would like to acknowledge the many producers of Indigenous media whose work on participation and self-determination has inspired our analysis.

The temporal unfolding of these mutually connected postings in networked spaces gives them a narrative form and agency. Applying Karlyn Campbell’s propositions about rhetorical agency to the case of #BlackLivesMatter, this essay shows that narrative agency in hashtag activism derives from its narrative form as well as from its contents and social context.

Drawing on an empirical case with online forums of education experts, we identify the following key issues: publicity versus privacy of the community; the definition of human subjects research; participant recruitment; informed consent; and ethical questions associated with observing virtual communities, and with reporting and disseminating research results. We maintain that different research cultures in different countries can present challenges when studying global forums. Acknowledging the ephemeral characteristics of Internet contexts, this paper argues that ethical considerations should be more case-based, instead of relying on one model for all solutions. We suggest that local ethics committees or institutional review boards could, with their expert knowledge of ethics, provide valuable support for researchers operating in the complex and dynamic terrain of Internet research, as well as in fields and research settings where an ethical review is not a standard part of the research process. © 2016 by the authors; licensee Cogitatio (Lisbon, Portugal).","Digital ethics; Ethics; Ethics committee; Institutional review board; Internet research ethics; Netnography; Online communities; Virtual communities",,,,,,,,,,"Bassett, E.H., O’Riordan, K., Ethics of Internet research: Contesting the human subjects research model (2002) Ethics and Information Technology, 4 (3), pp. 233-247; Bruckman, A., Studying the amateur artist: A perspective on disguising data collected in human subjects research on the Internet (2002) Ethics and Information Technology, 4 (3), pp. 217-231; Bruckman, A., Teaching students to study online communities ethically (2006) Journal of Information Ethics, Fall, 2006, pp. 82-95; Buchanan, E., Zimmer, M., Internet research ethics (2013) The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, , http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2013/entries/ethics-Internet-research, E.

The massive-scale experiment manipulated the News Feeds of a large amount of Facebook users and was successful in proving that emotional contagion happens also in online environments. However, the experiment caused ethical concerns within and outside academia mainly for two intertwined reasons, the first revolving around the idea of research as manipulation, and the second focusing on the problematic definition of informed consent. The article concurs with recent research that the era of social media and big data research are posing a significant challenge to research ethics, the practice and views of which are grounded in the pre social media era, and reflect the classical ethical stances of utilitarianism and deontology. © 2016 by the authors; licensee Cogitatio (Lisbon, Portugal).","Big data; Emotional contagion; Facebook; Informed consent; Manipulation; Methodology; Privacy; Research ethics; Social media; User data",,,,,,,,,,"Aiken, M., McMahon, C., A primer of research in mediated environments: Reflections on cyber-methodology (2014) SSRN Working Papers, , http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/Papers.cfm?abstract_id=2462700; Ananny, M., Toward an ethics of algorithms: Convening, observation, probability, and timeliness (2015) Science, Technology, and Human Values, 4 (1), pp. 93-117; Bail, C.A., Taming big data: Using app technology to study organizational behavior on social media (2015) Sociological Methods & Research, , http://smr.sagepub.com/content/early/2015/05/15/0049124115587825.full; Barsade, S., The ripple effect.

With the aim to further the understanding of digital non-participation as communicative strategy in activism, it builds upon empirical findings and argues that the online practices and use of social media, as could be observed in milieus associated with the radical left, indicates active non-participation and that this, in turn, is related to the ambition to claim autonomy. The article draws from existing scholarship on critical perspectives on protest movements and social media as well as empirical examples of online content published by radical leftist groups. Furthermore, it analyses how these activities could be understood in terms of active and passive non-participation, abstention or adaptation to social media affordances, as well as implosion of the social in digital media. The findings suggest that much of the activities in the material could be described as active non-participation and that this media practice relates to ideological positioning and values in the milieu. © 2016 by the author; licensee Cogitatio (Lisbon, Portugal).","Activism; Digital media; Non-participation; Online media; Radical left",,,,,,,,,,"Askanius, T., Radical online video: YouTube, video activism and social movement media practices (Doc-toral dissertation) (2012) Lund: Studies in Media and Communication, 17; Baudrillard, J., (1988) Selected Writings, , Cambridge: Polity; Beer, D., Power through the algorithm?

Research on the same (Internet related) topic is usually multidisciplinary, and understanding research ethics even inside the same research community may vary essentially. It is important to recognise and pay attention to online specific contexts as well as the researcher’s own disciplinary background. In this empirical research paper, we will first sum up our previous work. Currently, we are working on a model which will help in positioning multidisciplinary researchers as ethical actors based on their research topics and backgrounds. In this article, we will present this model with a demonstration of the empirical data collected as part of a Finnish research project called Citizen Mindscapes, which concerns the cultures and history of Finnish discussion forums. We argue that in Finland, and probably also worldwide, online research ethics is in a phase where the focus should be moving from defining the ethical guidelines to studying research ethics as such. We will also discuss how the model will be further developed in an in-depth empirical process. © 2016 by the authors; licensee Cogitatio (Lisbon, Portugal).","Digital culture; Digital humanities; Internet; Online specific research ethics; Online studies; Research ethics",,,,,,,,,,"Aull Davies, C., (2008) Reflexive Ethnography. a Guide to Researching Selves and Others, , London and New York: Routledge.

Energiewende describes the fundamental transition from non-renewable energy to sustainable sources. This goal is both ambitious and controversial. Numerous stakeholders try to make their voices and interests heard and as such politics has to both disseminate and collect information in order to include all relevant groups from different social fields in the political process. This discourse is also visible online. By analysing the hyperlink structures we are able to see the attention distribution of different actor groups in the network. This study shows that most actors tend to link within their own social field and do not aim for a more integrated public sphere. Especially political actors appear to be lone warriors who neither look left or right and mostly link within their own party and ignore other actors. Whereas social field as the media or public administration are relevant within the network we find that scientific actors are ignored by all fields, except for their own. © 2016 by the authors; licensee Cogitatio (Lisbon, Portugal).","Energiewende; Energy transition; Environment; Hyperlink publics; Network analysis; Online communication",,,,,,,,,,"Adamic, L.A., Glance, N., The political blog-osphere and the 2004 U.S. Election: Divided they blog (2005) Proceedings of the 3Rd International Workshop on Link Discovery, pp. 36-43. , New York: ACM; Althaus, M., (2012) Schnelle Energiewende: Bedroht Durch Wutbürger Und Umweltverbände?, , Protest, Be-teiligung und politisches Risikopotenzial für Großpro-jekte im Kraftwerk- und Netzausbau Wissenschaft-liche Beiträge.

In this paper, participation in social media is studied by utilising the framework of explicit and implicit participation. The focus is on the communicative and communal aspects of social media. The aim of the paper is to promote the reconsideration of what constitutes participation when online users create connections rather than content. The underlying argument is that research on social media and the development of methods should concentrate more on implicit forms of participation. © 2016 by the authors; licensee Cogitatio (Lisbon, Portugal).","Connectivity; Ethics; Explicit participation; Implicit participation; Methods; Social media",,,,,,,,,,"Anderson, C.W., Bell, E., Shirky, C., Post- industrial journalism (2013) Adapting to the Present, , http://towcenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/TOWCenter-Post_Industrial_Journalism.pdf; Belk, R.W., Sharing (2010) Journal of Consumer Research, 36 (5), pp. 715-734; Bruns, A., Reconciling community and commerce?

This model, developed in the project on the 2015 Charlie Hebdo attacks in Paris, was created specifically for researching digital media—and in particular, Twitter. The article is structured as follows. Firstly, the methodological scope is discussed against the theoretical context, e.g. the theory of media events. In the theoretical discussion, special emphasis is given to i) disruptive, upsetting, or disintegrative media events and hybrid media events and ii) the conditions of today’s heterogeneous and globalised media communication landscape. Secondly, the article introduces a multi-method approach developed for the analysis of hybrid media events. In this model, computational social science—namely, automated content analysis (ACA) and social network analytics (SNA)—are combined with a qualitative approach— specifically, digital ethnography. The article outlines three key phases for research in which the interplay between quantitative and qualitative approaches is played out. In the first phase, preliminary digital ethnography is applied to provide the outline of the event. In the second phase, quantitative social network analytics are applied to construct the digital field for research. In this phase, it is necessary to map a) what is circulating on the websites and b) where this circulation takes place. The third and final phase applies a qualitative approach and digital ethnography to provide a more nuanced, in-depth interpretation of what (substance/content) is circulating and how this material connects with the ‘where’ in the digital landscape, hence constituting links and connections in the hybrid media landscape. In conclusion, the article reflects on how this multi-method approach contributes to understanding the workings of today’s hybrid media events: how they create and maintain symbolic battles over certain imagined constructs of social imaginaries of solidarity, belonging, contestation, and exclusion, a topic of core value for the theory of media events. © 2016 by the authors; licensee Cogitatio (Lisbon, Portugal).","Automated content analysis; Charlie Hebdo; Digital ethnography; Hybrid media event; Social network analytics; Twitter",,,,,,"Tampereen Yliopisto, UTA","This article is based on the research project Je Suis Charlie?The symbolic battle and struggle over attention, conducted in the School of Communication, Media and Theatre in the University of Tampere.

It problematizes changes in the configurations of political agency in the context of digital media. The articles represent a shift from an exclusive focus on political elites to the interrelation between institutionalised politics and political processes in other societal spheres in the field of media and politics research. Political agency as the main notion of the thematic issue draws attention at the (media) practices through which social actors reproduce, reorganise and challenge politics. At the same time, the issue poses questions about the structures—economic, political and social—that allow for, define and also limit these practices. The contributions gathered here suggest an understanding of agency as constituted through the use of knowledge and resources, themselves embedded within structural contexts; at the same time, agency is transformative of the structures within which it is embedded by making use of knowledge and resources in creative and often radical ways. In that context the development of digital media marks a rupture or critical juncture that allows and requires a rethinking of conditions of political agency. Accordingly the contributions critically scrutinize the role of digital media moving beyond celebratory accounts of democratizing potential of digital media. The rethinking of the grammar of political agency is at the heart of this thematic issue. © 2016 by the authors; licensee Cogitatio (Lisbon, Portugal).","Digital media; Media practices; Political agency; Political participation",,,,,,,,,,"Andersson, L., No digital “castles in the air”: Online non-participation and the radical left (2016) Media and Communication, 4 (4), pp. 53-62; Benkler, Y., Roberts, H., Faris, R., Solow-Niederman, A., Etling, B., Social mobilization and the net- worked public sphere: Mapping the SOPA-PIPA debate (2015) Political Communication, 32 (4), pp. 594-624; Bennett, W.L., The personalization of politics political identity, social media, and changing patterns of participation (2012) The Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science, 644 (1), pp. 20-39; Bennett, L., Segerberg, A., (2013) The Logic of Connective Action.

This article explores the role of free software in the practices of digital artists, animators and technicians who work in various roles for the contemporary digital visual media industries. Rather than discussing it as a model of organising work, the study conceives free software as a production tool and shows how it becomes a locus of politics about finding material security in flexible capitalism. This politics is ultimately contradictory in that it extends creative and craft autonomy of digital artists but does not mobilise a critical project. Instead, it nurtures further precarious labour. Empirically, the article draws on eth-nographically collected material from the media practices of digital artists and programmers who engage with two popular free software production tools, Blender and Synfig. © 2016 by the author; licensee Cogitatio (Lisbon, Portugal).","Blender; Craft autonomy; F/OSS; Material politics; Media industries; Media tools; Open source software; Post-Fordism; Synfig",,,,,,,,,,"Atton, C., Alternative media in practice: The Indymedia network (2007) The Alternative Media Handbook, pp. 71-78. , K.

This study is the first of its kind to survey a large, nationally-representative sample of teens to investigate how they use the newest digital technologies, including mobile apps, social networking sites, electronic gaming and wearable devices, to explore health topics. The survey covered the types of health topics teens most frequently search for, which technologies they are most likely to use and how they use them, and whether they report having changed their behaviors due to digital health information. In addition, this survey explores how the digital divide continues to impact adolescents. Results of this study indicate that teens are concerned about many health issues, ranging from fitness, sexual activity, drugs, hygiene as well as mental health and stress. As teens virtually always have a digital device at their fingertips, it is clear that public health interventions and informational campaigns must be tailored to reflect the ways that teens currently navigate digital health information and the health challenges that concern them most. © 2016 by the authors; licensee Cogitatio (Lisbon, Portugal).","Adolescents; Digital technology; Health; Information-seeking",,,,,,,,,,"Ahtinen, A., Mattila, E., Vaatanen, A., Hynninen, L., Salminen, J., Koskinen, E., Laine, K., User experiences of mobile wellness applications in health promotion: User study of Wellness Diary, Mobile Coach and SelfRelax (2009) 3Rd International Conference on Pervasive Computing Technologies for Healthcare 2009, pp. 1-8. , Piscataway, NJ: IEEE; Cafazzo, J.A., Casselman, M., Hamming, N., Katzman, D.K., Palmert, M.R., Design of an mHealth app for the self-management of adolescent type 1 diabetes: A pilot study (2012) Journal of Medical Internet Research, 14 (3); Crutzen, R., De Nooijer, J., Brouwer, W., Oenema, A., Brug, J., De Vries, N.K., Strategies to facilitate exposure to internet-delivered health behavior change interventions aimed at adolescents or young adults: A systematic review (2010) Health Education & Behavior, 38 (1), pp. 49-62; Daniels, A., Tech to treat: The smokefree teen approach to cessation (2012) 2012 National Conference on Health Communication, Marketing, and Media, , Atlanta, GA: CDC; Divecha, Z., Divney, A., Ickovics, J., Kershaw, T., Tweeting about testing: Do low-income, parenting adolescents and young adults use new media technologies to communicate about sexual health?

The analysis offers a contrasting approach to various views of public diplomacy or strategic communication which privilege one form of governmental influence over others and treat partial aspects of national persuasion as complete pictures of government communication aimed at foreign audiences. Because so much of public diplomacy literature today emphasizes social media, it is necessary to determine how specific tools of influence such as international broadcasting, can be used in ways that fit new thinking in public diplomacy as well as continuously emerging new media ecologies. © 2016 by the authors; licensee Cogitatio (Lisbon, Portugal).","International broadcasting; Public diplomacy; Social media; Strategic communication; Strategic influence",,,,,,,,,,"Altheide, D., (1995) An Ecology of Communication, , New York: Walter de Gruyter; Armistead, L., (2010) Information Operations Matter, , Washington, DC: Potomac Books; Arndt, R., (2005) The First Resort of Kings: American Cultural Diplomacy in the Twentieth Century, , Washington, DC: Potomac Books; Arsenault, A., Networks of freedom, networks of control (2013) Relational, Networked, and Collaborative Approaches to Public Diplomacy: The Connective Mindshift, pp. 192-208. , R.

With the technological capability of accessing the internet from anywhere, at any time, paired with the enormous variety of internet activities in which youth engage—from social networking to chatting to streaming videos to playing games to watching television content—instances of problematic internet behavior have emerged. We conducted an online national survey of 629 US adolescents ages 12–17 years old and a matching survey of one of their parents. We investigated the relationship between problematic internet behavior and parental monitoring, parental mediation of internet use, and parental estimates of their adolescent’s time spent using computers. Analyses showed that problematic internet use was associated with less parental monitoring and parental mediation and poorer parental relationships. Adolescents that spent a lot of time on the computer were also more likely to engage in problematic internet use. Although we cannot determine the direction of the relationships, results support the important role of parents in adolescents’ problematic internet use. © 2016 by the authors; licensee Cogitatio (Lisbon, Portugal).","Adolescents; Computer time; Internet addiction; Parental mediation; Parental monitoring; Problematic internet use",,,,,,,,,,"(2013) DSM 5: Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, , Arlington: American Psychiatric Association; Aoyama, I., Barnard-Brak, L., Talbert, T., Cyberbullying among high school students: Cluster analysis of sex and age differences and the level of parental monitoring (2012) Evolving Psychological and Educational Perspectives on Cyber Behavior, p. 246; Bleakley, A., Jordan, A.B., Hennessy, M., The relationship between parents’ and children’s television viewing (2013) Pediatrics, 132 (2), pp. 364-371; Bleakley, A., Vaala, S.E., Jordan, A., Romer, D., The Annenberg media environment survey: Media access and use in U.S. homes with children and adolescents (2014) Media and the Well-Being of Children and Adolescents, pp. 1-19. , A.

As of 2013, nearly 20% of youths in grades 9–12 in the US reported being traditionally bullied in face-to-face encounters while almost 15% reported being cyberbullied (Kann et al., 2014). Bullying victimization is associated with a variety of behavioral and psychological effects, from becoming bullies themselves (i.e., bully-victims), to poor academic performance, depression and suicidal ideation (Nansel et al., 2001; Wang, Nansel, & Iannotti, 2011; Willard, 2007). Research on these phenomena has focused primarily on white youth, leaving a void in our understanding of how cyberbullying has affected youth of color. This narrative literature review addresses this oversight by providing an overview of recent cyberbullying research that focuses on Hispanic, Asian and black adolescents (k=15). We found that youth of color appear to be less likely to experience cyberbullying than white youth but they experience suicidal ideation and attempts at about the same rates when they do experience cyberbullying. © 2016 by the authors; licensee Cogitatio (Lisbon, Portugal).","Bullying; Cyberbullying; Mental health; Race; Youth",,,,,,"National Science Foundation, NSF: 0916152, 1421896","This material is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation under Grant Nos. 0916152 and 1421896.

Researchers have focused on understanding usage behaviors, quantifying effects of social media exposure and activity, and using social media to intervene. Much of this work has focused on college students and non-minority youth. In this paper, we examine the growing body of literature around social media use among US minority youth and its intersection with sexual risk behavior. We introduce the concept of the “digital neighborhood” and examine the intersection of social media and sexual health in two domains: 1) sexual content in social media and 2) evidence of social media effects on sexual behavior. Finally, we discuss the opportunities and challenges for researchers and practitioners engaging youth of color. © 2016 by the authors; licensee Cogitatio (Lisbon, Portugal).","African-American; Digital neighborhood;

This paper provides an overview of the literature on adolescent cellphone use while driving, focusing on the crash risk, incidence, risk factors for engagement, and the effectiveness of current mitigation strategies. We conclude by discussing promising future approaches to prevent crashes related to cellphone use in adolescents. Handheld manipulation of the phone while driving has been shown to have a 3 to 4-fold increased risk of a near crash or crash, and eye glance duration greater than 2 seconds increases crash risk exponentially. Nearly half of U.S. high school students admit to texting while driving in the last month, but the frequency of use according to vehicle speed and high-risk situations remains unknown. Several risk factors are associated with cell phone use while driving including: parental cellphone use while driving, social norms for quick responses to text messages, and higher levels of temporal discounting. Given the limited effectiveness of current mitigation strategies such as educational campaigns and legal bans, a multi-pronged behavioral and technological approach addressing the above risk factors will be necessary to reduce this dangerous behavior in adolescents. © 2016 by the author; licensee Cogitatio (Lisbon, Portugal).","Accidents prevention; Adolescent; Cell phones; Distracted driving; Text messaging",,,,,,"National Institute of Nursing Research, NINR: R00NR013548

A matched randomization technique was used to assign Rwandan Hutus and Congolese autochthons in South Kivu to listen to either of the two programmes within their naturalistic contexts for 13 months. At the end of the treatment, participants’ perceptions of barriers to peace; descriptive and prescriptive interventions; victimhood and villainity; opportunities for personal development and civic engagement; and knowledge of repatriation processes were assessed in 16 focus groups across four contexts. The study concludes that international media intervention programmes that provide robust information and a platform for objective analyses within a multiple narrative and participatory framework can enhance greater engagement with nascent democratic reforms, positive perception of long term opportunities for personal development and empathy with the ethnic Other. © 2016 by the author; licensee Cogitatio (Lisbon, Portugal).","Demobilisation; Dialogue entre congolais; Disarmament; Gutahuka; Repatriation",,,,,,"British Institute in Eastern Africa, BIEA","The author acknowledges the generous financial support of the British Institute in Eastern Africa (BIEA) for the field elements of this research.",,,"Afoaku, O.G., Congo rebels: Their motivations and strategies (2002) The African Stakes in the Congo War, pp. 109-128. , J.

The rise of regional media has provided weaker states with opportunities to challenge the monopoly of information on the part of the more powerful states. Al-Hurra, the American sponsored channel to the Arab World, stands as evidence of the challenges facing US policies in this part of the world because of the influential role of regional media. It was particularly Al-Jazeera that transformed the media sphere in the Arab World as well as globally in what became known as “Al-Jazeera effect”. The paper argues that identity presentation plays a major role in determining performance of the public diplomacy of the media. © 2016 by the author; licensee Cogitatio (Lisbon, Portugal).","Al-Hurra; Al-Jazeera; Communication revolution; Counter-hegemonic discourse; Gaza war; Hegemony; Identity representation; Public diplomacy; Regional media",,,,,,,,,,"Abdelmoula, E., (2015) Al Jazeera and Democratization: The Rise of The Arab Public Sphere, , New York: Routledge; Abercombie, N., (1996) Television and Society, , Cambridge: Polity Press; (2008), December 27, Al-Hurra; (2008), December 28, Al-Hurra; (2008), December 30, Al-Hurra; Allen, B., O’Loughlin, O., Japerson, A., Sullivan, J., The media and the gulf war: Framing, priming and the spiral of silence (1994) Polity, 27 (2), pp. 255-285; Anderson, B., (1991) Imagined Communities: Reflections on the Origin and Spread of Nationalism, , Lon-don:Verso; Ayalon, A., (1995) The Press in the Arab Middle East: A History, , Oxford: Oxford University Pres; Baylouny, A.M., Al-manar and alhurra: Competing satellite stations and ideologies (2005) CSRC Discussion Paper, 5 (49), pp. 1-23; Bell, A., Garret, P., (1998) Approaches to Media Discourse, , Malden: Blackwell Publishers; Bessaiso, E., Al-Jazeera and the war in Afghanistan: A delivery system or a mouthpiece?

Traditional media is known to have both a positive and negative influence on youth health behaviours, but the impact of social media is less well understood. This paper first summarises current evidence around adolescents’ exposure to the promotion and marketing of unhealthy products such as energy dense and nutrient poor food and beverages, alcohol, and tobacco on social media sites such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and YouTube. We explore emerging evidence about the extent of exposure to marketing of these harmful products through social media platforms and potential impacts of exposure on adolescent health. Secondly, we present examples of health-promoting social media campaigns aimed at youth, with the purpose of describing innovative campaigns and highlighting lessons learned for creating effective social media interventions. Finally, we suggest implications for policy and practice, and identify knowledge gaps and opportunities for future research. © 2016 by the authors; licensee Cogitatio (Lisbon, Portugal).","Advertising; Alcohol; Junk food; Social marketing; Social media; Tobacco; Youth",,,,,,"Australian Research Council, ARC: FT120100932","Sandra Jones is funded by an Australian Research Council Future Fellowship (FT120100932).

Resilience is often assumed to have positive connotations, but critics view it with great suspicion, regarding it as a neo-liberal governmental strategy. However, we argue that surveillance, introduced in the name of greater security, may itself erode social freedoms and public goods such as privacy, paradoxically requiring societal resilience, whether precautionary or in mitigation of the harms it causes to the public goods of free societies. This article develops new models and extends existing ones to describe resilience processes unfolding over time and in anticipation of, or in reaction to, adversities of different kinds and severity, and explores resilience both on the plane of abstract analysis and in the context of societal responses to mass surveillance. The article thus focuses upon surveillance as a special field for conceptual analysis and modelling of situations, and for evaluating contemporary developments in “surveillance societies”. © 2015 by the authors.","Democracy; Privacy; Public goods; Resilience; Security; Surveillance",,,,,,,,,,"Aradau, C., The promise of security: Resilience, surprise and epistemic politics.

The paper also suggests that field theory could be usefully deployed in future research to explore how wider global trends or social forces, such as neo-liberalism or bio-power, are refracted through the crime control field in different national jurisdictions. We conclude by showing how this approach provides a bridge between society-wide analysis and micro-sociology by exploring how the operation of new surveillance technologies is mediated by the “habitus” of surveillance agents working in the crime control field and contested by surveillance subjects. © 2015 by the author.","Capital; Crime control; Resistance; Surveillance",,,,,,"Economic and Social Research Council, ESRC: RES-062-23-0969","The author would like to thank three anonymous reviewers and the editors of this special edition for their insightful comments and advice.

This paper analyzes the surveillance industry that has emerged as a result. Copyright surveillance systems identify copyright infringement online and identify persons to hold responsible for infringing acts. These practices have raised fundamental questions about the nature of identification and attribution on the internet, as well as the increasing use of algorithms to make legal distinctions. New technologies have threatened the profits of some media industries through copyright infringement, but also enabled profitable forms of mass copyright surveillance and enforcement. Rather than a system of perfect control, copyright enforcement continues to be selective and uneven, but its broad reach results in systemic harm and provides opportunities for exploitation. It is only by scrutinizing copyright surveillance practices and copyright enforcement measures that we can evaluate these consequences. © 2015 by the author.","Algorithmic; Copyright enforcement; Copyright surveillance; Identification; Internet",,,,,,,,,,"Anderson, N., (2007) Peer-To-Peer Poisoners: A Tour of Mediadefender., , http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2007/03/mediadefender, Ars Technica.

What does it mean to know of a surveillance apparatus that recedes from your sensory experience at every turn? How do we mobilise that knowledge for opinion and action when its benefits and harms are only articulable in terms of future-forwarded “as if”s? If the extent, legality and efficacy of surveillance is allegedly proven in secrecy, what kind of knowledge can we be said to “possess”? This essay characterises such knowing as “world-building”. We cobble together facts, claims, hypotheticals into a set of often speculative and deferred foundations for thought, opinion, feeling, action. Surveillance technology’s recession from everyday life accentuates this process. Based on close analysis of the public mediated discourse on the Snowden affair, I offer two common patterns of such world-building or knowing. They are (1) subjunctivity, the conceit of “I cannot know, but I must act as if it is true”; (2) interpassivity, which says “I don’t believe it/I am not affected, but someone else is (in my stead)”. © 2015 by the author.","Belief; Experience; Imagination; Interpassivity; Media; Mythology; Ritual; Surveillance; Technology; Uncertainty",,,,,,,,,,"Adey, P., Facing airport security: Affect, biopoli-tics, and the preemptive securitisation of the mo-bile body (2009) Environment and Planning D: Society and Space, 27 (2), pp. 274-295; Anderson, B.R., (1991) Imagined Communities: Reflec-Tions on the Origin and Spread of Nationalism (Re-Vised An.), , London: Verso; Andrejevic, M., (2013) Infoglut: How Too Much Infor-Mation is Changing the Way We Think and Know, , New York: Routledge; Andrejevic, M., (2013) What We Talk about When We Talk about Privacy.

Since a great deal of journalistic content published on the internet has been free of charge for years, attempting to monetarise this content is now proving complicated. This article considers the motivating factors behind attitudes towards paying for online journalistic content in different population groups. We follow two directions: attitudes towards paying for online news, and obstacles that compromise willingness to pay in different groups. The survey results and trends noticed by media organisations indicate that the public’s readiness to pay for journalistic online content is growing, albeit slowly. Based on the outcomes of various interviews we can conclude that the expectation of exclusive quality and web distinctive content are the two main reasons behind willingness to pay for online journalistic content, however, it is difficult to outline particular preference groups based on cultural, demographic, or socio-economic characteristics. This seems to be the result of audience fragmentation—the reasons behind willingness to pay for online journalistic content are hidden in the interests and preferences of small audience groups. © 2015 by the authors; licensee Cogitatio (Lisbon, Portugal).","Audience studies; Media audience; Online journalism; Paywalls; Pricing models; Willingness to pay",,,,,,"Tartu Ãlikool, TÃ","The authors would like to thank Merilin Sarapuu and Juhan Lang, both students of the University of Tartu, who contributed their time and effort in conducting the interviews for this research.",,,"Boczkowski, P.J., The processes of adopting multimedia and interactivity in three online newsrooms (2004) Journal of Communication, 54 (2), pp. 197-213; Brandstetter, B., Schmalhofer, J., Paid content (2014) Journalism Practice, 8 (5), pp. 499-507; Castells, M., (2006) Mobile Communication and Society: A Global Perspective, , Cambridge: MIT Press; Chyi, H.I., Yang, M.J., Lewis, S.C., Zheng, N., Use of and satisfaction with newspaper sites in the local market: Exploring differences between hybrid and online-only users (2010) Journalism and Mass Communication Quarterly, 87 (1), pp. 62-83; Cingel, D.P., Lauricella, A.R., Wartella, E., Conway, A., Predicting social networking site use and online communication practices among adolescents: The role of access and device ownership (2014) Media and Communication, 2 (2), pp. 1-30; Courtois, C., Schrøder, K.C., Kobbernagel, C., Exploring landscapes of news consumption cross-nationally (2015) Revitalising Audience Research: Innovations in European Audience Research, pp. 123-142. , F.

What does not arouse public concern are longstanding governmental practices that involve surveillance of poor people who receive certain types of public benefits. This article traces the political history of U.S. poverty-relief programs, considers the perspective of welfare beneficiaries themselves, analyzes American cultural beliefs about the poor in order to offer some thoughts on why those surveillance practices garner little public concern, and argues that those who are concerned about warrantless surveillance of ordinary citizens should do more to protect ordinary poor citizens from surveillance. © 2015 by the author; licensee Cogitatio (Lisbon, Portugal).","Beneficiaries; Poor; Poverty; Public benefits; Surveillance; Welfare",,,,,,,,,,"Alvarez, L., No savings found in Florida welfare drug tests (2012) The New York Times, , http://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/18/us/no-savings-found-in-florida-welfare-drug-tests.html, Retrieved from; Angwin, J., (2014) Dragnet Nation: A Quest for Privacy, Security, and Freedom in A World of Relentless Surveillance, , (First edition).

As such, they form a rich case study on the interactions of “veillance” (mutual watching) involving citizens, journalists, intelligence agencies and corporations. While Surveillance Studies, Intelligence Studies and Journalism Studies have little to say on surveillance of citizens’ data by intelligence agencies (and complicit surveillant corporations), they offer insights into the role of citizens and the press in holding power, and specifically the political-intelligence elite, to account. Attention to such public oversight mechanisms facilitates critical interrogation of issues of surveillant power, resistance and intelligence accountability. It directs attention to the veillant panoptic assemblage (an arrangement of profoundly unequal mutual watching, where citizens’ watching of self and others is, through corporate channels of data flow, fed back into state surveillance of citizens). Finally, it enables evaluation of post-Snowden steps taken towards achieving an equiveillant panoptic assemblage (where, alongside state and corporate surveillance of citizens, the intelligence-power elite, to ensure its accountability, faces robust scrutiny and action from wider civil society). © 2015 by the author; licensee Cogitatio (Lisbon, Portugal).","Counterveillance; Equiveillance; Intelligence agencies; Journalism; Public oversight mechanisms; Snowden leaks; Sousveillance; Surveillance; Univeillance; Veillance",,,,,,"Economic and Social Research Council, ESRC: 2014-16

Most striking was the purchase of one of the largest publishing houses Mafra by the tycoon Andrej Babiš in June 2013, followed by the takeover of the Czech branch of Ringier by other Czech businessmen later that year. The first case in particular instigated immense discussion about the economic and ethical crisis facing Czech journalism since Babiš is also a powerful political figure (currently the Minister of Finance). In response, a significant number of leading, well-known journalists left media owned by big business and launched projects of quality or “slow” journalism which had until that point been merely discussed theoretically. This paper—based on the results of the Czech part of the Worlds of Journalism Study project—addresses the shift in the ways journalists perceive their roles and ethical responsibilities before and after the 2013 ownership changes. We also present the manner in which these changes are reflected in emerging media projects. It seems that those journalists not affected by the ownership change tend to view journalism ethics and the ability of journalism to exert power more seriously than before. © 2015 by the authors; licensee Cogitatio (Lisbon, Portugal).","Czech Republic; Ethics of journalism; Journalism; Journalistic roles; Ownership change; Pressures on journalism",,,,,,,,,,"Altschull, H., (1995) Agents of Power: The Media and Public Policy, , White Plains: Longman; Bantz, C., News organizations: Conflict as a craft ed cultural norm (1997) Social Meanings of News, pp. 123-137. , D.

AS is a specific kind of coercive neoliberal surveillance, which in the name of fighting tax evasion and corruption is targeting the middle and lower economic strata and not the rich upper classes. It is based mainly on “coveillance,” i.e. citizen-informers’ grassing, public naming, and shaming. Functioning as a domination and disciplinary control mechanism of the entire population, it works within a post-democratic setting without accountability or democratic control. We provide empirical evidence of these features and functions, including some indicative personal testimonies of austerity surveillance subjects. After presenting some cases of electronic surveillance as an indispensable supplement to AS, we then briefly underline the negative personal, and socio-political impact of this surveillance. In conclusion, a tentative assessment is made of AS’ efficiency in the Greek case, comparing it with other types of past and present authoritarian surveillance in Greece and in other current surveillance societies, considering also the prospects for its abolition or its reproduction by the new leftist government. © 2015 by the author; licensee Cogitatio (Lisbon, Portugal).","Austerity; Coveillance; Greece; Surveillance",,,,,,"University of Stirling","The author would like to acknowledge the inspiring effect for this article of Lilian Mitrou?s article (2012) ?Naming and shaming in Greece: Social control as law enforcement tool? in C.

These biologically imperative responses are directly responsible for evolved automatic reactions away from biological threats (e.g. escaping predators, avoiding disease and noxious stimuli) and towards opportunities (e.g. consuming food, approaching mates, finding shelter) in the environment. When elicited, these responses take time to occur and may de-lay or interfere with other types of behavior. Thus, when environmental information is presented in pictures (which should elicit larger biological responses than words) biological responses should interfere more with higher order tasks like information processing and cognitive decision-making. To test this proposition we designed an experiment in which participants performed speeded categorizations of 60 pairs of matched pleasant and unpleasant environmental opportunities and threats. They categorized the items based on their form (is this a word or a picture?) or based on how the picture made them feel (is this pleasant or unpleasant to you?). If pictures do elicit greater biologically imperative responses than their word counterparts, participants should be able to make form decisions faster than feeling decisions, especially when presented with words rather than pictures and especially when the words and pictures have less bio-logical relevance. This main proposition was supported. Implications for this proposition in terms of communication theory are discussed. © 2015 by the authors.","Dynamic systems; Embedded; Embodied; Message processing; Pictures; Words",,,,,,,,,,"Bertenthal, B.I., Dynamical systems: It’s about time!

This incident, together with an incident three months earlier involving Edward Snowden, caused the U.S. government to critically examine their background investigation (BI) process; because both Snowden and Alexis had supposedly slipped through the cracks of their investigations, there must be some flaw in the BI procedure. The U.S. Committee on Oversight and Reform concluded that rules forbidding “background checkers from looking at the Internet or social media when performing checks” was one of the main factors contributing to defective BIs (Report, 2014). Since the report’s release, the Director of National Intelligence has been debating and trialing whether information from the Internet should be used to form a data double for BIs (Kopp, 2014; Rockwell, 2014). Using this conversation as a discussion catalyst, I argue that due to the nature of the data double, if the United States were to adopt the use of social networking sites (SNSs) for security clearance purposes, neglecting to take into account basic principles of SNSs into the process of BIs may lead to misinformation and unfavorable adjudication. Ultimately, being literate about the social practices involved in SNSs and surveillance would benefit not only investigators, but any-one, including academics, looking at individuals in online spaces. © 2015 by the authors.","Background investigations; Data double; Literacies; Sorting; Surveillance",,,,,,,,,,"Adjudicative guidelines for determining eligibility for access to classified information.(2006, February 3).

Referencing the findings of the “Democratization of media policy in the digital ecosystems” (2014–2015) research project, the study aims to map the effectiveness of existing tools, practices and attitudes toward opening-up Polish public media enterprises to the public. Examination of media regulation, grey literature (corporate documentation, strategies, reports) and civil society initiatives are likely to indicate the ways and extent to which members of the public might currently participate in the decisionmaking and control. On the basis of hypotheses that public media enterprises in Poland are not fully prepared for the multi-stakeholder and advanced model of PSM, the study takes into account potential systemic/regulatory, organizational and social barriers for change. The salient questions to be addressed are: What are the strategies and practices through which members of civil society might get involved? At what stages are the publics able to engage?

In the majority of CEE countries, the media and communication research was re-established after the collapse of communism. Since then, a critical mass of active scholars has appeared who form an integral part of the larger European academia. A gradual integration of East and West perspectives in media and communication research is taking place along with moving away from the barely West-centred approach, and utilizing the research done by CEE scholars.

But the reality seems to be far from this definition. In practice, in many countries the religious radio stations officially belong to—or even dominate—this sector. In 2011 a new period began for community broadcasting in Hungary. While most of the former community media broadcasters could not find resources with which to operate, the community media landscape was dramatically overwhelmed by religious broadcasters both on regional and local levels. The legally-recognised third tier of broadcasting in Poland called ‘social broadcasting’ is actively and exclusively used by religious radio—seven stations broadcast locally and one is a powerful nationwide radio station called Radio Maryja. The authors gathered information and points of views from radio experts, organizations and activists living and working in different EU and non-EU states about the place of religious broadcasting in the community media sector. Two case-studies (Hungary and Poland) may be of interest for countries considering the introduction or reorganisation of regulations regarding community broadcasting. © 2015 by the authors; licensee Cogitatio (Lisbon, Portugal).","Community radio; Hungary; Media policy; Poland; Religious broadcasters",,,,,,,,,,"(1994) The Community Radio Charter for Europe, , http://www.amarc.org/index.php?p=Community_Radio_Charter_for_Europe; Belardi, N., (2014) An Interview Conducted by Urszula Doliwa and Gabriella Velics during the Bundesverband Freier Radios Congress in Berlin/Potsdam Zukunftswerkstatt Community Media, , 2014, 8th November; Brodzki, S., Surdykowski, J., (1981) Stan Komunikacji społecznej U Progu Lat osiemdziesiątych.

While boundary- and intersubjectivity-based theories of privacy register some of the harms linked to such practices I demonstrate how neither are holistically capable of registering these harms. Given these theories’ deficiencies I argue that critiques of signals intelligence surveillance practices can be better grounded on why the practices intrude on basic communicative rights, including those related to privacy. The crux of the argument is that pervasive mass surveillance erodes essential boundaries between public and private spheres by compromising populations’ abilities to freely communicate with one another and, in the process, erodes the integrity of democratic processes and institutions. Such erosions are captured as privacy violations but, ultimately, are more destructive to the fabric of society than are registered by theories of privacy alone. After demonstrating the value of adopting a communicative rights approach to critique signals intelligence surveillance I conclude by arguing that this approach also lets us clarify the international normative implications of such surveillance, that it provides a novel way of conceptualizing legal harm linked to the surveillance, and that it showcases the overall value of focusing on the implications of interfering with communications first, and as such interferences constituting privacy violations second. Ultimately, by adopting this Habermasian inspired mode of analysis we can develop more holistic ways of conceptualizing harms associated with signals intelligence practices than are provided by either boundary- or intersubjective-based theories of privacy. © 2015 by the author; licensee Cogitatio (Lisbon, Portugal).","Critical theory; Democracy; Habermas; Intelligence; National security; Privacy; Surveillance; Telecommunications",,,,,,"Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada, SSHRC","Funding to conduct this research has been provided by the Social Science and Humanities Research Council of Canada and the Canadian Internet Registration Authority?s Community Investment Program.",,,"Ackerman, S., NSA warned to rein in surveillance as agency reveals even greater scope (2013) The Guardian, , http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jul/17/nsa-surveillance-house-hearing, Retrieved from; Allen, A., (1985) Uneasy Access: Privacy for Women in a Free Society, , Totowa, NJ: Rowman and Littlefield; Austin, A., Getting past privacy?

Montenegro became one of them in 2009, when “media literacy” was introduced as an optional subject for 16 and 17 year old students of Gymnasium high schools. This article presents the findings of the first and only research conducted so far on media education in Montenegro. It is a national case study which examines the potential of media education to change the school culture and accelerate education system reform towards embracing the new digital education paradigm in the future. The focus is on the results of research conducted through in-depth interviews with media literacy teachers all over the country. Despite the many challenges, all teachers identify the potential of media education to strengthen some of the key competences of the students and to improve their motivation and academic performance. They also identify potential to change positively school culture by transforming teachers into “cultural mediators” (Morcellini, 2007) and by supporting the formation of a “participative culture” (Jenkins & Kelley, 2013) in schools. This research recommends focusing education reform on spreading the media education pedagogy to the entire curriculum in order to embrace the new digital education paradigm in the future. © 2015 by the author; licensee Cogitatio (Lisbon, Portugal).","Children; Civic participation; Creative media production; Critical thinking; Media education; Media literacy; Media pedagogy; Montenegro; Youth",,,,,,,,,,"Aufderheide, P., (1993) Media Literacy. a Report of the National Leadership Conference on Media Literacy, , Aspen: Aspen Institute; Bešić, M., Reškovac, T., (2012) Evaluacija Reforme Obrazovanja U Crnoj Gori (2010–2012).

This article does not seek to discuss surveillance per se, but instead to open a new line of inquiry by presenting qualitative research on the Chaos Computer Club (CCC)-one of the world’s largest and Europe’s oldest hacker organizations. Despite the longstanding conception of hacking as infused with political significance, the scope and style of hackers’ engagement with emerging issues related to surveillance re-mains poorly understood. The rationale of this paper is to examine the CCC as a civil society organization that counter-acts contemporary assemblages of surveillance in two ways: first, by de-constructing existing technology and by supporting, building, maintaining and using alternative media technologies and infrastructures that enable more secure and anonymous communication; and second, by articulating their expertise related to contemporary MTI to a wide range of audiences, publics and actors. Highlighting the significance of “privacy” for the health of democracy, I argue that the hacker organization is co-determining “interstitial spaces within information processing practices” (Cohen, 2012, p. 1931), and by doing so is acting on indispensable structural features of contemporary democratic constellations. © 2015 by the authors.","Big data; Civil society organization; Counter-power; Democracy; Hacker; Locative media; Media technologies and infrastructures; Participatory media; Privacy; Surveillance",,,,,,,,,,"Albrechtslund, A., Online social networking as participatory surveillance (2008) First Monday, 13 (3); Andrejevic, M., (2007) Ispy: Surveillance and Power in the Interactive Era, , Lawrence: University Press of Kansas; Andrejevic, M., Gates, K., Big data surveillance: Introduction (2014) Surveillance & Society, 12 (2), pp. 185-196; Ball, K., (2009) Exposure: Exploring the Subject of Surveillance.

This has been studied for “offline” media, but barely for online communication. Furthermore, the enormous spectrum of online communication has not been taken into account. This study investigates whether specific dynamics of attention on issues and sub-topics can be found in different online public arenas. We expect to identify differences across various arenas as a result of their specific stakeholders and constellations of stakeholders, as well as different trigger events. To examine these assumptions, we shed light on the online climate change discourse in Germany by undertaking a quantitative content analysis via manual and automated coding methods of journalistic articles and their reader comments, scientific expert blogs, discussion forums and social media at the time of the release of the 5th IPCC report and COP19, both in 2013 (n = 14.582). Our results show online public arena-specific dynamics of issue attention and sub-topics. In journalistic media, we find more continuous issue attention, compared to a public arena where everyone can communicate. Furthermore, we find event-specific dynamics of issue attention and sub-topics: COP19 received intensive and continuous attention and triggered more variation in the sub-topics than the release of the IPCC report. © 2015 by the authors.","Climate change; Dynamics of sub-topics; Issue attention; Online communication; Online public arenas",,,,,,"Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG

Three value pairs underlying the attitude towards information are explored: individualism and collectivism (the relation of man to the state), universalism and particularism (the relation of man to man), and pluralism versus dominance (the nature of knowledge and truth). Continuities are found between the Communist Soviet Union and post-Communist Russia in their instrumental use of media and information (collectivism), the view on information as a particular privilege rather than a universal right and the monopoly of truth. Post-Communism, therefore, appears not only as an indication of time (i.e. the period after Communism) but also as an indicator of the continuation of basic value orientations over these time periods. © 2015 by the author; licensee Cogitatio (Lisbon, Portugal).","Collectivism; Communism; Information culture; Particularism; Post-Communism; Russia; Value orientations",,,,,,,,,,"Almond, G.A., Verba, S., (1963) The Civic Culture.

Without any doubt, the Internet revolution affected electoral campaigning on every level. Online campaigning before local elections is often marginalized by political scientists and other scholars researching political marketing. However, the question emerges: are the candidates aware of the possibilities that new media has brought to political communication? Content analysis of all the major online communication tools has allowed the author to analyze the patterns of using websites, official Facebook profiles and Twitter accounts of candidates during the 2014 Lower Silesian Regional assembly elections. The Lower Silesian Voivodeship is among the fastest developing regions in Poland with high Internet penetration rate. Is the Internet campaign treated as a second-class way to communicate with potential voters, or is it perceived as an opportunity to reach electorate online? © 2015 by the author; licensee Cogitatio (Lisbon, Portugal).","E-campaigning; Internet; New media; Own media; Poland; Political communication; Regional elections; Social media",,,,,,"Uppsala Universitet","Author would like to thank prof.

This has happened despite the fact the Estonian media policy is in line with the European Union (EU) media policy, which should ensure freedom of information, diversity of opinion and media pluralism. Findings of the Estonian case study show that despite these noble aims, Estonia has two radically different information fields: one for Estonian speaking audiences and one for Russian speakers. Events in Ukraine have added to the democratic media policy paradigm a question of national security. Now it is a challenge for the policy makers to unite polarised media fields and how to minimise the impact of Russian propaganda. On the EU level, one supportive measure could be a revision of the Audiovisual Media Service Directive. © 2015 by the author; licensee Cogitatio (Lisbon, Portugal).","Estonia; Media for minorities; Public service broadcasting; Russian language media",,,,,,,,,,"(2007) Teostatavusuuring Venekeelse Elektroonilise Meedia Tarbijate Infovajaduse Rahuldamise võimalustest.

From its Enlightenment origins, transparency is related to accountability and legitimacy: its increase is believed to promote these. It has earned a position as an unassailed, prime normative value in contemporary liberal and social democracies. Though still valued, transparency is undergoing change in an era of ubiquitous surveillance. Publics still anticipate governmental and corporate self-disclosure and for such entities to operate visibly; but increasingly, deliberate and incidental surveillance by a range of sources, both institutional and informal, documents the activities of such authorities. More often, civilians participate in producing or amplifying transparency. This article explores this new transparency through a study of U.S. police, focusing on the discourse of police accountability activists and cop watchers to describe how their work adapts traditional notions of transparency. Recognizing the resilience of the police institution despite the new visibility of its violence, the article challenges the presumption that increased transparency will promote institutional reform or crisis. It concludes with a critical comment on prominent expectations that promoting the visibility of police can protect publics and ensure police accountability. This conclusion has implications for other forms of the new transparency, including whistleblowing (e.g., Edward Snowden) and leaking (e.g., WikiLeaks). © 2015 by the author; licensee Cogitatio (Lisbon, Portugal).","Accountability; Cop watch; Jean Jacques Rousseau; Jeremy Bentham; Legitimacy; Media participation; Police; Sousveillance; Surveillance; Transparency",,,,,,"Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, RPI","Thanks to Crina Archer, Langdon Winner, and Nancy D.

This article sketches the contours of an emerging culture of interveillance where non-hierarchical and non-systematic monitoring practices are part of everyday life. It also introduces a critical perspective on how the industrial logics of dominant social media, through which interveillance practices are normalized, resonate with social forces already at play in individualized societies. The argument is developed in three steps. Firstly, it is argued that the concept of interveillance is needed, and must be distinguished from surveillance, in order to critically assess the everyday mutual sharing and disclosure of private information (of many different kinds). Secondly, it is argued that the culture of interveillance responds to the social deficit of recognition that characterizes highly individualized societies. Finally, it is argued that the culture of interveillance constitutes a defining instance and even represents a new stage of the meta-process of mediatization. The dialectical nature of interveillance integrates and reinforces the over-arching ambiguities of mediatization, whereby the opportunities for individuals and groups to achieve growing freedom and autonomy are paralleled by limitations and dependences vis-à-vis media. © 2015 by the author; licensee Cogitatio (Lisbon, Portugal).","Identity; Interveillance; Mediatization; Recognition; Social media; Surveillance",,,,,,"VetenskapsrÃ¥det, VR","This article is part of the ongoing research project ?Cosmopolitanism from the Margins: Mediations of Expressivity, Social Space and Cultural Citizenship?, funded by the Swedish Research Council (2012?2015).

The paper also proposes to use the concept “discursive institutionalism” in order to clarify what knowledge and opinions about media are formed in the interaction of media institutions and academia with other institutions in society (e.g. educational, political and judicial). The concept “discursive institutionalism” includes the role of academia in providing new knowledge by conducting and disseminating research on the national and international levels, and this deserves greater attention. Although it is a common understanding that the role of academia is to prepare young professionals, it is less discussed how national media research and journalism education, in synergy, can create and maintain a collective understanding regarding the role and performance of national journalism in turbulent times. The paper is a meta-analysis of published research, and the empirical part of the study includes a close reading of academic articles, reports and conference presentations that are available in English about media in Central and Eastern European (CEE) countries. Examples of research from selected CEE countries provide a descriptive view of problems and tendencies concerning media performance in these countries. The proposed analytical approach aims to connect these problems and provide ideas for further research. © 2015 by the author; licensee Cogitatio (Lisbon, Portugal).","Academic scholarship; Actor approach; CEE countries; Discursive institutionalism; Journalism culture",,,,,,,,,,"Anagnostou, D., Craufurd Smith, R., Psychogiopoulou, E., The formation and implementation of national media policies in Europe and their relationship to democratic society and media freedom and independence (2010) Athens: Eliamep, , http://www.mediadem.eliamep.gr/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/theoretical-report.pdf, A theoretical and analytical frame for the MEDIADEM project; Bajomi-Lázár, P., The party colonisation of the media: The case of Hungary (2013) East European Politics & Societies, 27 (1), pp. 69-89; Balčytienė, A., Changing journalistic discourses in the Baltic states—How to deal with cheap journalism (2008) Finding the Right Place on the Map: Central and Eastern European Media Change in Global Perspective, pp. 211-226. , K.

However, despite a recognition of the media’s important democratic function in the transition countries of Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) after the fall of socialism, the consideration of council newspapers’ political role in the Czech Republic and Slovakia have been largely absent in debates surrounding the development of regulatory frameworks until recently. Interestingly, debates regarding local government transparency emerged recently (2011) in the United Kingdom, resulting in the Code of recommended practice on local authority publicity, underscoring the importance of this issue. However, developments in the aforementioned situations demonstrate divergent outcomes in such considerations: the British addressed the causes, the Czechs addressed the symptoms, and the Slovaks have yet to make any headway. This article utilizes qualitative analysis of policy and regulation documents to compare the trajectories of media policy and regulation of council publicity in the Czech Republic and Slovakia, ultimately contrasting it with developments in the UK, suggesting possible future trajectories for the development of this type of regulation in the CEE countries. © 2015 by the author; licensee Cogitatio (Lisbon, Portugal).","Council newspapers; Czech media; Media; Politics; Press regulation; Slovak media; UK media policy",,,,,,,,,,"Bučko, M., Radničné noviny sú vyhodené peniaze daňovníkov.

It moves beyond previous accounts of video surveillance in relation to film by theoretically situating the use of these surveillance images in a broader “surveillant assemblage”. To this end, scenes from a sample of thirty-five (35) films of several genres are examined to discern dominant discourses and how they lend themselves to normalization of video surveillance. Four discourses are discovered and elaborated by providing examples from Hollywood films. While the films provide video surveillance with a positive associative association it is not without nuance and limitations. Thus, it is found that some forms of resistance to video surveillance are shown while its deterrent effect is not. It is ultimately argued that Hollywood film is becoming attached to a video surveillant assemblage discursively through these normalizing discourses as well as structurally to the extent actual video surveillance technology to produce the images is used. © 2015 by the authors; licensee Cogitatio (Lisbon, Portugal).","Assemblages; Discourses; Film; Normalization; Surveillance; Video",,,,,,,,,,"Albrechtslund, A., Surveillance and ethics in film: Rear window and the conversation (2008) Journal of Criminal Justice and Popular Culture, 15 (2), pp. 129-144; Albrechtslund, A., Dubbeld, L., The plays and arts of surveillance: Studying surveillance as entertainment (2005) Surveillance & Society, 3 (2-3), pp. 216-221; Andrejevic, M., (2004) Reality TV: The Work of Being Watched, , Oxford: Rowman & Littlefield Publishers; Andrejevic, M., The work of watching one another: Lateral surveillance, risk, and governance (2005) Surveillance & Society, 3 (4), pp. 479-497; Babbie, E., Benaquisto, L., (2002) Fundamentals of Social Research (1st Ed.), , Scarborough: Thomson-Nelson; Barnard-Wills, D., UK news media discourses of surveillance (2011) Sociological Quarterly, 52 (4), pp. 548-567; Bauman, Z., Bigo, D., Esteves, P., Guild, E., Jabrie, V., Lyon, D., Walker, R., After Snowden: Rethinking the impact of surveillance (2014) International Political Sociology, 8, pp. 121-144; Bogard, W., Surveillance assemblages and lines of flight (2006) Theorizing Surveillance: the Panopticon and Beyond, pp. 97-122. , In D.

The fundamental rights to respect for private life and the protection of personal data underpin this framework within the European Union. Accordingly, the protection of the principles and safeguards required by these rights is key to ensuring that the oversight of State surveillance powers is robust and transparent. Furthermore, without the robust scrutiny of independent judicial review, the principles and safeguards guaranteed by these rights may become more illusory than real. Following the Edward Snowden revelations, major concerns have been raised worldwide regarding the legality, necessity and proportionality standards governing these laws. In 2014, the highest court in the EU struck down the legal framework that imposed a mandatory duty on communication service providers to undertake the mass retention of metadata for secret intelligence and law enforcement authorities across the EU. This article considers the influence of the Snowden revelations on this landmark judgment. Subsequently, the analysis explores the significance of this ruling for the future reform of EU law governing metadata surveillance and its contribution to the worldwide debate on indiscriminate and covert monitoring in the post-Snowden era. © 2015 by the author.","Edward Snowden; EU law; Human rights; Judicial review; Mass surveillance; Metadata; Personal data; Privacy",,,,,,,,,,"(2014) Opin-Ion 04/2014 on Surveillance of Electronic Communica-Tions for Intelligence and National Security Purposes, , Article 29 Data Protection Working Party, Brussels: Secretariat of the European Commission; (2014) CCIA’s Response to the European Court of Justice Online Privacy Ruling, , https://www.ccianet.org/2014/05/ccias-response-to-european-court-of-justice-online-privacy-ruling, Retrieved from; (2015) Pod-Cast of Conference Proceedings “European Internet Regulation after Google Spain”, , https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLy4oXRK6xgzH6JjMA09uPmqOrahpPM9Xhttps://itunes.apple.com/us/itunes-u/eu-internet-regulation-after/id986766672?mt=10http://sms.cam.ac.uk/collection/1951973, University of Cam-bridge: UK.

Attentive audiences say in surveys that they feel overloaded with information, and journalists tend to agree. Although news seems to have become more focused on events, several studies analyzing U.S. news content for the past century and a half show that journalists have been including fewer events within their cover-age. In newspapers the events in stories declined over the twentieth century, and national newscasts decreased the share of event coverage since 1968 on television and since 1980 on public radio. Mainstream news websites continued the trend through the 2000s. Instead of providing access to more of the “what”, journalists moved from event-centered to meaning-centered news, still claiming to give a factual account in their stories, built on a foundation of American re-alism. As journalists concentrated on fewer and bigger events to compete, audiences turned away from mainstream news to look for what seems like an abundance of events in digital media. © 2014 by the author.","Content analysis; Cultural critique; Five Ws; History; Journalism; Media studies; News; Realism; Social constructionism",,,,,,,,,,"Allen, F.L., (1922) Newspapers and the Truth, p. 44. , Atlantic Monthly, January; Alterman, E., What Liberal Media?

The article outlines general aspects of cognitive theory in humanities and social science, however the main focus is on the role of narrative, visual style and emotional dimensions of different types of documentaries. Dealing with cognitive theories of film and media and with memory studies, the article analyses how a cognitive approach to documentaries can increase our understanding of how documentaries influence us on a cognitive and emotional level and contribute to the forming of our social and cultural imagination. The article analyses case studies of documentaries dealing with climate change and the environment and documentaries dealing with social history. © 2014 by the author.","Cognitive theory; Documentary and climate change; Documentary genres; Emotions; Historical documentary; Memory; Narrative; Social and cultural imagination",,,,,,,,,,"Assman, J., Communicative and Cultural Memory (2006) Cultural Memory Studies. an International and Interdisciplinary Handbook, , A.

Card stories can be described as selfdisclosing videos or confessions, using a new frame for telling one’s own story audio-visually to the public by combining ‘old’ (hand-written messages) and ‘new’ media (video, computer mediated communication). In 2012/13, a qualitative and exploratory study with a sample of 25 card story videos on YouTube was conducted. The content and visual analysis revealed (1) that these videos are bound to a very specific frame of presentation, (2) that they deal with specific topics, and (3) that the presenter does not remain (visually) anonymous. These findings question previous research results that stressed a strong correlation between online self-disclosure and (visual) anonymity; further, the findings show that this special frame of textual confessions via video supports deep self-disclosures. © 2014 by the author.","Anonymity; Card story; Computer-mediated communication; Frame; Self-disclosure; Video; YouTube",,,,,,,,,,"Altman, I., Taylor, D., (1973) Social Penetration: The Development of Interpersonal Relationships, , New York, NY: Holt; Archer, R.L., Self-disclosure (1980) The Self in Social Psychology, , D.

This study’s findings indicate that the communication strategy of the local health Non-Governmental Organization (NGO) is changing in response to the in-creased effectiveness and impact of social media. Using social media (e.g., Twitter) the KLPG can quickly and effectively construct an issue-based advocacy group. Consequently, more legitimacy and representativeness through collected support from the general public have further empowered the KLPG. Yet, the sustainability component in the relation-ships built through social media use was not evidenced in the current findings. The effects of social media use were ana-lyzed based on data from interviews with top-level KLPG executive members and general members, and from documen-tation and archival materials.

If it is difficult to assert how much these severe images changed public opinion, one can appreci-ate how the emerging visual culture was transforming the way that modern societies communicate with and direct their citizens' thoughts. © 2014 by the author.","Impact of still and moving images; Nanking atrocity",,,,,,,,,,"Aitken, I., (1988) The Documentary Film Movement: An Anthology, , Edinburgh, UK: Edinburgh University Press; Bayly, C., Harper, T., (2005) Forgotten Armies, , Lon-don, UK: Penguin; Bayly, C., Harper, T., (2007) Forgotten Wars, , Cam-bridge, MA: Belknap Press of Harvard University Press; The Bombing of the USS Panay, 1938.

We tested the theory’s prediction in a time series model with annual changes in violence portrayal on popular US TV shows from 1972 to 2010 as a predictor of changes in public perceptions of local crime rates and fear of crime. We found that contrary to the prediction that TV violence would affect perceptions of crime rates, TV violence directly predicted fear of crime holding constant national crime rates and perceptions of crime rates. National crime rates predicted fear of crime but only as mediated by perceptions of local crime rates. The findings support an interpretation of cultivation theory that TV drama transports viewers into a fictive world that creates fear of crime but without changing perceptions of a mean world. © 2014 by the authors.","Content analysis; Crime; Cultivation theory; Fear; Transportation theory; TV violence",,,,,,,,,,"Beckett, K., (1999) Making Crime Pay: Law and Order in Contemporary American Politics, , New York: Oxford University Press; Brooks, T., Marsh, E.F., (2009) The Complete Directory to Prime Time Network and Cable TV Shows, 1946-Present, , New York: Random House LLC; (2013) FBI Uniform Crime Reporting Statistics: National Crime Estimates by Years, 1960-2010, , http://www.ucrdatatool.gov/index.cfm, Bureau of Justice Statistics, Retrieved from; Bushman, B.J., Jamieson, P.E., Weitz, I., Romer, D., Gun violence trends in movies (2013) Pediatrics, 132 (6), pp. 1014-1018; Bryant, J., Miron, D., Theory and research in mass communication (2004) Journal of Communication, 54 (4), pp. 662-704; Chiricos, T., Eschholz, S., Gertz, M., Crime, news and fear of crime: Toward an identification of audience effects (1997) Social Problems, 44, pp. 342-357; Deighton, J., Romer, D., McQueen, J., Using drama to persuade (1989) Journal of Consumer Research, 16 (3), pp. 335-343; Diebold, F.X., (2007) Elements of Forecasting, , 4th ed.

Using data collected from a national sample of 467 adolescents between the ages of 13 and 17, results indicate that demographics, technology access, and technology ownership are related to social media use and communication practices. Specifically, females log onto and use more constructive communication practices on Facebook compared to males. Additionally, adolescents who own smartphones engage in more constructive online communication practices than those who share regular cell phones or those who do not have access to a cell phone. Overall, results imply that ownership of mobile technologies, such as smartphones and iPads, may be more predictive of social networking site use and online communication practices than general ownership of technology. © 2014 by the authors.","Adolescents; Cell phones; Demographics; Facebook; Internet-capable mobile devices; Online communication practices; Predictors; Social networking sites",,,,,,,,,,"Barbosa, A., O’Neill, B., Ponte, C., Simões, J.A., Jereissati, T., (2013) Risks and Safety on the Internet: Comparing Brazilian and European Children, , EU Kids Online: London, UK; Beasley, S., Conway, A., (2011) Digital Media in Everyday Life: A Snapshot of Devices, Behaviors, and Attitudes, , Chicago, IL: Museum of Science and Industry; Blumler, J.G., The role of theory in uses and gratifications studies (1979) Communication Research, 6, pp. 9-36; Boyd, D.M., Ellison, N.B., Social networking sites: Definition, history, and scholarship (2008) Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication, 13, pp. 210-230; Christofides, E., Muise, A., Desmarais, S., Information disclosure and control on Facebook: Are they two sides of the same coin or two different processes?

But with no definitive definition for what constitutes data in journalism, it is difficult to determine what the implications of collecting, analysing, and disseminating data are for journalism, particularly in terms of objectivity in journalism. Drawing selectively from theories of mediation and research in journalism studies we critically examine how data is incorporated into journalistic practice. In the first half of the paper, we argue that data's value for journalism is constructed through mediatic dimensions that unevenly evoke different socio-technical contexts including scientific research and computing. We develop three key dimensions related to data's mediality within journalism: the problem of scale, transparency work, and the provision of access to data as 'openness'. Having developed this first approach, we turn to a journalism studies perspective of journalism's longstanding “regime of objectivity”, a regime that encompasses interacting news production practices, epistemological assumptions, and institutional arrangements, in order to consider how data is incorporated into journalism's own established procedures for producing objectivity. At first sight, working with data promises to challenge the regime, in part by taking a more conventionalist or interpretivist epistemological position with regard to the representation of truth. However, we argue that how journalists and other actors choose to work with data may in some ways deepen the regime's epistemological stance. We conclude by outlining a set of questions for future research into the relationship between data, objectivity and journalism. © 2014 by the authors.","Data; Data journalism; Mediality; Regime of objectivity",,,,,,,,,,"Abrams, F., Benkler, Y., (2013) Death to Whistle-Blowers?, , http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/14/opinion/the-impact-of-thebradley-manning-case.html?_r=0, Retrieved from; Anderson, C.W., Towards a sociology of computational and algorithmic journalism (2012) New Media and Society, 15 (7), pp. 1-17; Arthur, C., (2010) Analysing Data is the Future for Journalists, Says Tim Berners-Lee, , http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2010/nov/22/data-analysis-tim-berners-lee, The Guardian.

The study reported here addresses related gaps in the literature by first comparing the topical agendas of two leading traditional media outlets (New York Times and CNN) with the most frequently shared stories and trending topics on two widely popular Social Networking Sites (Facebook and Twitter). Time-series analyses of the most prominent topics identify the extent to which traditional media sets the agenda for social media as well as reciprocal agenda-setting effects of social media topics entering traditional media agendas. In addition, this study examines social intermedia agenda setting topically and across time within social networking sites, and in so doing, adds a vital understanding of where traditional media, online uses, and social media content intersect around instances of focusing events, particularly elections. Findings identify core differences between certain traditional and social media agendas, but also within social media agendas that extend from uses examined here. Additional results further suggest important topical and event-oriented limitations upon the predictive capacity of social networking sites to shape traditional media agendas over time. © 2013 by the authors; licensee Librello, Switzerland.","Election coverage; Focusing events; Granger causality; Intermedia agenda setting; Social media",,,,,,,,,,"McCombs, M., Shaw, D., The Agenda-setting Function of the Mass Media (1972) Public Opinion Quarterly, 36 (2), pp. 176-185; Weaver, D.H., Audience Need for Orientation and Media Effects (1980) Communication Research, 7 (3), pp. 361-373; Ghanem, S., Filling in the tapestry: The second level of agenda setting (1997) Communication and Democracy: Exploring the Intellectual Frontiers in Agenda-Setting Theory, pp. 3-14. , McCombs MD, Shaw DL, Weaver DH, editors, Mahwah, NJ, USA: LEA; McCombs, M., (2004) Setting The Agenda: The Mass Media and Public Opinion, , Malden, MA, USA: Blackwell Publishing; Groshek, J., Homogenous Agendas, Disparate Frames: CNN and CNN International Coverage Online (2008) Journal of Broadcasting and Electronic Media, 52 (1), pp. 52-68; Song, Y., Internet news media and issue development: A case study on the roles of independent online news services as agenda-builders for anti-US protests in South Korea (2007) New Media Society, 9 (1), pp. 71-92; Roberts, M., Wanta, W., Dzwo, T., Agenda setting and issue salience online (2002) Communication Research, 29 (4), pp. 452-465; Papacharissi, Z., The virtual sphere (2002) New Media & Society, 4 (1), pp. 9-27; Bruns, A., (2009) Blogs, Wikipedia, Second Life, and Beyond: From Production to Produsage, , New York, NY, USA: Peter Lang; Johnson, T.J., The Abacus, 8-Track Tapes…and Agenda Setting?, , http://mediaconvergence.org/blog/?p=1054, (accessed on 10 December 2010); Meraz, S., Using Time Series Analysis to Measure Intermedia Agenda-Setting Influence in Traditional Media and Political Blog Networks (2011) Journalism & Mass Communication Quarterly, 88 (1), pp. 176-194; Entman, R., Cascading activation: Contesting the White House’s frame after 9/11 (2003) Political Communication, 20 (4), pp. 415-432; Baum, M.A., Groeling, T., Online media and the polarization of American political discourse (2008) Political Communication, 25 (4), pp. 345-365; Boczkowski, P.J., de Santos, M., When more media equals less news: Patterns of content homogenization in Argentina’s leading print and online newspapers (2007) Political Communication, 24 (2), pp. 167-180; Reese, S.D., Theorizing a globalized journalism (2008) Global Journalism Research: Theories, Methods, Findings, Future, pp. 240-252. , Loeffelholz M, Weaver DH, editors, London, UK: Blackwell; Gans, H., (2003) Democracy and the News, , New York, NY, USA: Oxford University Press; boyd, D., Ellison, N.B., Social network sites: Definition, history, and scholarship (2007) Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication, 13 (1). , article 11; Bennett, W.L., Iyengar, S., A new era of minimal effects?

Using data collected from a national sample of 467 adolescents between the ages of 13 and 17, results indicate that demographics, technology access, and technology ownership are related to social media use and communication practices. Specifically, females log onto and use more constructive communication practices on Facebook compared to males. Additionally, adolescents who own smartphones engage in more constructive online communication practices than those who share regular cell phones or those who do not have access to a cell phone. Overall, results imply that ownership of mobile technologies, such as smartphones and iPads, may be more predictive of social networking site use and online communication practices than general ownership of technology. © 2014 by the authors; licensee Librello, Switzerland.","Adolescents; Cell phones; Demographics; Facebook; Internet-capable mobile devices; Online communication practices; Predictors; Social networking sites",,,,,,,,,,"Lenhart, A., (2009) Teens and Social Media: An Overview, , Washington, DC, USA: Pew Internet & American Life Project; Lenhart, A., (2009) Adults and Social Network Websites, , Washington, DC, USA: Pew Internet & American Life Project; Lenhart, A., Purcell, K., Smith, A., Zickuhr, K., (2010) Social Media and Mobile Internet Use among Teens and Young Adults, , Washington, DC, USA: Pew Internet & American Life Project; Madden, M., Lenhart, A., Cortesi, S., Gasser, U., Duggan, M., Smith, A., Beaton, M., (2013) Teens, Social Media, and Privacy, , Washington, DC, USA: Pew Internet & American Life Project; Beasley, S., Conway, A., (2011) Digital Media in Everyday Life: A Snapshot of Devices, Behaviors, and Attitudes, , Chicago, IL, USA: Museum of Science and Industry; Boyd, D., Ellison, N.B., Social network sites: Definition, history, and scholarship (2008) Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication, 13 (1), pp. 210-230; Livingstone, S., Taking risky opportunities in youthful content creation: Teenagers’ use of social networking sites for intimacy, privacy, and self-expression (2008) New Media & Society, 10 (3), pp. 393-411; Whitlock, J.L., Powers, J.L., Eckenrode, J., The virtual cutting edge: The Internet and adolescent self-injury (2006) Developmental Psychology, 42 (3), pp. 407-417; Valkenburg, P.M., Peter, J., Adolescents’ identity experiments on the Internet: Consequences for social competence and self-concept unity (2008) Communication Research., 35 (2), pp. 208-231; Valkenburg, P.M., Peter, J., Schouten, A.P., Friend networking sites and their relationship to adolescents’ well-being and social self-esteem (2006) Cyberpsychology & Behavior, 9 (5), pp. 584-590; Social Media, Social Life: How Teens View Their Digital Life, , http://www.commonsensemedia.org/research/socialmedia-social-life, (accessed on 25 September 2012); Valkenburg, P.M., Peter, J., Preadolescents’ and adolescents’ online communication and their closeness to friends (2007) Developmental Psychology, 43 (2), pp. 267-277; Christofides, E., Muise, A., Desmarais, S., Information disclosure and control on Facebook: Are they two sides of the same coin or two different processes?

But with no definitive definition for what constitutes data in journalism, it is difficult to determine what the implications of collecting, analysing, and disseminating data are for journalism, particularly in terms of objectivity in journalism. Drawing selectively from theories of mediation and research in journalism studies we critically examine how data is incorporated into journalistic practice. In the first half of the paper, we argue that data’s value for journalism is constructed through mediatic dimensions that unevenly evoke different socio-technical contexts including scientific research and computing. We develop three key dimensions related to data’s mediality within journalism: the problem of scale, transparency work, and the provision of access to data as ‘openness’. Having developed this first approach, we turn to a journalism studies perspective of journalism’s longstanding “regime of objectivity”, a regime that encompasses interacting news production practices, epistemological assumptions, and institutional arrangements, in order to consider how data is incorporated into journalism’s own established procedures for producing objectivity. At first sight, working with data promises to challenge the regime, in part by taking a more conventionalist or interpretivist epistemological position with regard to the representation of truth. However, we argue that how journalists and other actors choose to work with data may in some ways deepen the regime’s epistemological stance. We conclude by outlining a set of questions for future research into the relationship between data, objectivity and journalism. © 2014 by the authors; licensee Librello, Switzerland.","Data; Data journalism; Mediality; Regime of objectivity",,,,,,,,,,"Donsbach, W., Klett, B., Subjective objectivity.

The publishers of these images were continuing the art of manipulation of public opinion through multimodal visual media, aiming them especially at the less educated mass public. The text attempts to describe these brutal images in their historical context. Viewing and understanding the underlying racial context and emotive impact of these images may be useful adjuncts to future students of World War II. If it is difficult to assert how much these severe images changed public opinion, one can appreciate how the emerging visual culture was transforming the way that modern societies communicate with and direct their citizens’ thoughts. © 2014 by the authors; licensee Librello, Switzerland.","Impact of still and moving images; Nanking atrocity",,,,,,,,,,"Sontag, S., (1977) On Photography, , New York, NY, USA: Farrar Strauss and Giroux; (2002) The New Yorker, pp. 82-98. , www.college.colombia.edu/core/files/pages/Sontag-essay.pdf, 9 December(accessed on 18 November 2013); Hopkinson, T., (1970) Picture Post 1938–50, , Harmondsworth, UK: Penguin; Evans, G., (1984) John Grierson and The National Film Board: The Politics of Wartime Propaganda 1939–1945, , Toronto, Canada: University of Toronto Press; Stott, W., (1978) Documentary Expression and Thirties America, , New York, NY, USA: Oxford University Press; Roeder, G., Jr., (1993) The Censored War, , New Haven, CT, USA: Yale University Press; Linfield, S., (2010) The Cruel Radiance, , Chicago, IL, USA: University of Chicago; Linfield embraces the power of photography and takes issue with Sontag’s criticism of the medium’s deep emotional bite. Linfield rebukes intellectuals like Barthes, Berger and key postmodernists who probed an image’s spectacle, emotion and absence of context; A contemporary variation of this is China’s interest to use the event to promote nationalism while simultaneously reining in overenthusiastic activists; Fogel, J.A., (2000) The Nanjing Massacre in History and Historiography, , Berkeley, CA, USA: University of California Press; Chang, I., (1997) The Rape of Nanking: The Forgotten Holocaust of World War II, , New York, NY, USA: Basic Books; Yoshida, T., (2006) The Making of the “Rape of Nanking”: History and Memory in Japan, China and the United States, , New York, NY, USA: Oxford University Press; Wakabayashi, B.T., (2007) The Nanking Atrocity 1937–38: Complicating the Picture, , New York, NY, USA: Berghahn Books; This book of contributions by sixteen authors deals with an overview of the event, the debate over victim figures, perpetrators and collaborators, and the ongoing issue of Japanese denial. Its detailed methodology points the way for other researchers to follow. The Japanese deniers’ argument is that most Chinese civilian deaths resulted from justifiable legal battlefield actions against unlawful combatants who were armed or had access to arms in the Nanking Safety Zone. They maintain (ignoring the illegal invasion and occupation of China) that no deliberate massacre took place for which Japan must apologize or pay compensation (pp. 359–360). Wakabayashi’s own conclusion of 40,000 to 200,000 victims from August to December 1937 reduces the issue to an argument about numbers (p. 384). Numerically speaking, the Nanking count of between 40,000 and 369,000 victims pales next to the Jewish losses of between 5.2 and 5.8 million. If the Japanese unleashed deadly weaponry against Nanking’s prisoners of war and committed rape and pillage of numerous civilians, the Germans committed wholesale industrial murder against their victims, root and branch. An historical irony is that in1938, LIFE magazine referred to the tragedy of Nanking as a “holocaust”, seven years before that word took on its contemporary meaning referring to the judeocide; Nanking, Christmas 1937 by Yim Ho (Hong Kong), The Truth About Nanjing by Satoru Mizushima (Japan), and Nanking by Bill Gutentag and Dan Sturman (United States). These films present the subject from each national optic. Lust, Caution by Ang Lee, (Hai Sheng Productions, 2007) is a romantic drama set during the occupation of Shanghai. See also City of Life and Death (2009) which is suffused with the violence, death and sexual depredations that accompanied the Rape of Nanking; The postwar Tokyo War Crimes Trial (1947) established a total number of 300,000 killed and 20,000 raped. Present research estimates of Chinese murdered vary widely from 40,000 (by Japanese authors) to over 369,000 (by Chinese authors). Rapes are even more difficult to document because of the shame and stigma associated with victims of this crime; Masahiro Yamamoto [18] discusses the two approaches that now characterize interpretations of the Rape of Nanking as traditionalist and revisionist. He spends considerable effort detailing extant figures on the killings, but concludes that wide divergences between Japanese and other sources keep from bringing both sides to closure. He spends much less energy discussing the rapes and other civilian depredations (pp. 135–138) than he does arguing about numbers killed. He circumvents the elemental question of Japanese aggression in China; Yamamoto, M., (2000) Nanking, Anatomy of an Atrocity, , Westport, CT, USA: Praeger; The Name of the Emperor, a National Film Board of Canada production in 1998, directed by Hong Kong filmmakers Christine Choy and Nancy Tong. A number of Japanese veterans confess to committing pillage, rape and murder on orders from their officers. This makes the issue of numbers far less important than the issue of agency. One has only to follow the chain of command to realize that the Rape of Nanking is undoubtedly a war crime that was official (unwritten until documents prove otherwise) policy.

Two hundred were killed. The dramatic rescue of a child survivor is pictured here.”; Photo: “Chinese man picks up baby found lying on the railroad track at bombardment of train station in August 1937”, Text: “An Infant Survivor of the Japanese bombardment of Shanghai’s South Station was found lying on the railroad tracks half hidden under the wreckage. Here a young Chinese man picks up the infant, starts for the opposite platform”; Photo: “Man with baby picking way through wreckage”, Text: “The Baby Howls as his rescuer picks his way through the wreckage. When the bombs struck South Station it was jammed with poor Chinese waiting to escape war-torn Shanghai on a train to the south. Two hundred were killed”; Photo: “Man crossing tracks nearing platform”. Text: “They Near the Platform⋯Two squadrons of 8 planes each bombed the station. At the same time, they bombed Nantoa, a native residential section of South Shanghai. A civilian section, Nantoa was totally unprepared for the raid and the planes flew away unharmed after the bombing. Previously the Japanese had announced they might issue a warning if Nantoa were to be bombed, but the actual attack came without warning”; Photo: “Rescuer leaves baby on platform”, Text: Rescuer Leaves the Terrified Baby on the platform and returns to the wreckage to help other victims of the raid. Then a child and man approach (above) to take the baby to a near-by first aid station. At the right lies the body of a 14-year-old boy, one of the 15 children found dead in the raid.

But aerial raids continue, with an increasing toll of dead. Chinese bombers and gunners, as well as Japanese, have been responsible for some of the deaths of innocent non-combatants—American and European as well as Oriental—in this undeclared war” (International News photographs); Fielding, R., (1972) The American Newsreel, 1911–1967, , Norman, OK, USA: University of Oklahoma; Jespersen, C.T., (1996) American Images of China 1931–49, , Stanford, CA, USA: Stanford University Press; Time’s circulation was 1,000,000. The photo’s effect was so powerful that when Madame Chiang Kai-Shek arrived in the United States five years later, a New Jersey homemaker sent her a letter with three dollars to “help the little guy on the railroad tracks somewhere in China”. Hariman and Lucaites, in No Caption Needed [39], identified the four traits or cultural conventions of an iconic photograph: wide recognition, a historically significant event, evoking a strong emotional response, and widespread reproduction (p. 85); Hariman, R., Lucaites, J.L., (2007) No Caption Needed, , Chicago, IL, USA: University of Chicago Press; Historian David Perlmutter supports the Hariman and Lucaites thesis ([39], pp. 3–8) that iconic images dominate public opinion, with a caveat noting the importance of individual predispositions and values.

Interestingly, this appears to be one of the first times the word “holocaust” was used to describe the brutality that ranks among the most heinous that modern state machinery can provoke. The Nazi destruction of the Jews of Europe widened its definition from 1945 on to mean the Jewish genocide; Roeder mentions that America suppressed similar wartime images, such as a 1945 photo of a Japanese soldier’s severed head ([6], p. 148); LIFE. 10 January 1938; LIFE. 18 April 1938; George Fitch, who had been in Nanking, smuggled the Magee film out of China and circulated it to many civic groups in the prewar period in an effort to convince Washington to cease selling scrap metal to Japan. Poor health prevented him from showing the film more frequently and he gave it to Arthur N. Bierkle who screened it to groups mainly in southern California. Wider dissemination occurred when The March of Time used some of the footage in 1942 and Frank Capra used segments in his wartime series Why We Fight: The Battle for China, 1944; http://humanum.arts.cuhk.edu.hk/NanjingMassacre/NMMage.html, Nanjing Massacre (Sharon Kuykendall 17 April 1996).(accessed on 18 November 2013); LIFE. 30 May and 20 June 1938; See LIFE issues 1, 15 August 1938; 17 October 1938; 7, 14, 21 November 1938; 5, 12 December 1938; LOOK. 22 November 1938; This photo was cropped and published again on 20 December 1938; The photo and article are reproduced in [54].

(79–89) There should be more methodological investigation of how the widely circulated newsreel images of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor (especially footage of the exploding battleship Arizona) became iconic in convincing the American public to wage the Pacific war as a war of revenge; Deluca, K.M., The Speed of Immanent Images: The Dangers of Reading Photographs (2006) Visual Communication: Perception, Rhetoric and Technology, , Hope DS, editor, Cresskill, NJ, USA: Hampton Press; Maclean’s. 15 February and 15 March 1938; New York Times reporters filed reports on the fall of Nanking. These were edited by the Gazette on 8, 10, and 11 December with one article on the 22nd devoting one line to a ‘breakdown of discipline’. 25 January marked the first reference to the ‘scandalous’ conditions of ‘lawlessness and bestiality’. A day later an editorial repeated the main points and explained that Japan had forbidden foreign reporters to cable responsible editorial comments. On 8 February an article stated that General Matsui admitted that the army had run amok in Nanking, ‘raping Chinese women, shooting private citizens and looting property’. These were the sole references to the Nanking atrocities; Fielding, R., (1978) The March of Time, 1935–1951, , New York, NY, USA: Oxford University Press; Luce interfered rarely in the series produced by Louis de Rochemont, if only to make Chiang Kai Shek a sacred cow. The construction of the newsreel was left to de Rochemont who made decisions on what to run; The series’ Pacific war issues were Crisis in the Pacific, China Fights Back, The Philippines and Australia at War; The discussion of the total death toll includes the 1948 estimate of 200,000 to a more recent statistic of 369,366, which includes 190,000 victims of mass killings and 150,000 victims of random killings including rape (pp. 242–244). Japanese officer Toshio Ohta discussed body disposal at Xiaguan where 30,000 soldiers and 120,000 civilians including elders, women and children were disposed of (p. 260). Revisionist scholarship of the 1990s challenged this so-called traditionalist interpretation. Revisionists have cut by more than half the 300,000 plus figure, though the figure of at least 20,000 or more rapes seems not to be an issue for them; Fitch’s film evidence appeared in the 1990s in two documentaries, Testament by Magee and In the Name of the Emperor by Choy and Tong; Capra, F., (1944) Why We Fight.

These should strengthen the case for Japan accepting its moral responsibility for the atrocity in order to bring closure.

Far from being neutral platforms for everyone, social media have changed the conditions and rules of social interaction. In this article, we examine the intricate dynamic between social media platforms, mass media, users, and social institutions by calling attention to social media logic—the norms, strategies, mechanisms, and economies—underpinning its dynamics. This logic will be considered in light of what has been identified as mass media logic, which has helped spread the media’s powerful discourse outside its institutional boundaries. Theorizing social media logic, we identify four grounding principles—programmability, popularity, connectivity, and datafication—and argue that these principles become increasingly entangled with mass media logic. The logic of social media, rooted in these grounding principles and strategies, is gradually invading all areas of public life. Besides print news and broadcasting, it also affects law and order, social activism, politics, and so forth. Therefore, its sustaining logic and widespread dissemination deserve to be scrutinized in detail in order to better understand its impact in various domains. Concentrating on the tactics and strategies at work in social media logic, we reassess the constellation of power relationships in which social practices unfold, raising questions such as: How does social media logic modify or enhance existing mass media logic? And how is this new media logic exported beyond the boundaries of (social or mass) media proper? The underlying principles, tactics, and strategies may be relatively simple to identify, but it is much harder to map the complex connections between platforms that distribute this logic: users that employ them, technologies that drive them, economic structures that scaffold them, and institutional bodies that incorporate them. © 2013 by the authors; licensee Librello, Switzerland.","Facebook; Mass media; Media activism; Platform analysis; Social media; Twitter; Viral",,,,,,,,,,"(2012) One Example of International Press Coverage was a Report in the Daily News/New York Daily, , www.nydailynews.com/news/world/dutch-teen-sweet-16-party-invitation-viral-facebook-ends-3-000-rioting-groningen-suburb-article-1.1165386, (accessed on 29 July 2013); As one editorial in a prominent Dutch national newspaper stated: “Social media are not the cause of these riots; in the past, a call to arms on radio could mobilize a bunch of people.

For premiere episodes, an 8.5% increase in Twitter volume is associated with a 1% increase in TV program ratings for 18-34 year olds. Additionally, a 14.0% increase in Twitter volume is associated with a 1% increase in TV program ratings for 35-49 year olds, reflecting a stronger relationship between Twitter and TV for younger audiences.

'This is an excellent book that provides students with a broad series of summary outlines of key thinkers on media and communication, without conflating the two terms' - Michael Pickering, University of Loughborough. Magisterial in scope, Media and Communication traces the historical development of media and communication studies. Media Studies itself has a short history but many antecedents, and in this comprehensive and compelling book, Paddy Scannell sets out to describe and analyze its formulation in North American and Europe. Media and Communication offers an accessible and comprehensive analysis of the development of media and communication theory: Includes a summary outline of all the key thinkers; Looks at the study of communication across a range of disciplines—history, literature, sociology, philosophy and linguistics; Challenges readers to engage with the central importance of communication. © Paddy Scannell 2007.",,,,,,,,,,,"Abbott, A., (1999) Department and Discipline: Chicago Sociology at One Hundred, , Chicago: University of Chicago Press; Adorno, T., Scientific experiences of a European scholar in America (1969) The Intellectual Migration: Europe and America 1930-1960, pp. 338-370. , D.
