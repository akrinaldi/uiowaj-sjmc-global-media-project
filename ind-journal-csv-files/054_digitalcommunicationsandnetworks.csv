With the increase of the number of intelligent sensing devices, the accuracy of the search system in querying the entities to match the user's request is reduced, and the delay of entity search is increased. We use the mobile edge technology to alleviate this problem by processing user requests on the edge side and propose a similar physical entity matching strategy for the mobile edge search. First, the raw data collected by the sensor is lightly weighted and expressed to reduce the storage overhead of the observed data. Furthermore, a physical entity matching degree estimation method is proposed, in which the similarity between the sensor and the given sensor in the network is estimated, and the matching search of the user request is performed according to the similarity. Simulation results show that the proposed method can effectively reduce the data storage overhead and improve the precision of the sensor search system. © 2019 Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications","Entity matching; Internet of things search; Mobile edge computing; Similarity calculation",,,,,,"cstc2019jcyj-msxmX0303

Recently, security breaches in many IoT applications have indicated that IoT applications may put the physical systems at risk. Severe resource constraints and insufficient security design are two major causes of many security problems in IoT applications. As an extension of the cloud, the emerging edge computing with rich resources provides us a new venue to design and deploy novel security solutions for IoT applications. Although there are some research efforts in this area, edge-based security designs for IoT applications are still in its infancy. This paper aims to present a comprehensive survey of existing IoT security solutions at the edge layer as well as to inspire more edge-based IoT security designs. We first present an edge-centric IoT architecture. Then, we extensively review the edge-based IoT security research efforts in the context of security architecture designs, firewalls, intrusion detection systems, authentication and authorization protocols, and privacy-preserving mechanisms. Finally, we propose our insight into future research directions and open research issues. © 2019 Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications","Architecture; Authentication; Authorization; Edge computing; Firewall; Internet of Things (IoT); Intrusion detection; Privacy; Secure protocols; Security",,,,,,"National Science Foundation, NSF: 1723596

Meanwhile, in order to ensure the security of physiological privacy data and the identity privacy of patients, this paper presents a privacy protection strategy for Mobile Edge Computing(MEC) enhanced WBANs, which leverages the blockchain-based decentralized MEC paradigm to support efficient transmission of privacy information with low latency, high reliability within a high-demand data security scenario. On this basis, the Merkle tree optimization model is designed to authenticate nodes and to verify the source of physiological data. Furthermore, a hybrid signature algorithm is devised to guarantee the node anonymity with unforgeability, data integrity and reduced delay. The security performance analysis and simulation results show that our proposed strategy not only reduces the delay, but also secures the privacy and transmission of sensitive WBANs data. © 2019 Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications","Blockchain; Hybrid signature algorithm; Merkle tree optimization model; Mobile edge computing; Wireless body area networks",,,,,,"cstc2019jcyj-msxm1238

In order to meet this growing need, mobile wireless networks have been advanced at a tremendous pace over recent days. However, the centralized architecture of existing mobile networks, with limited capacity and range of bandwidth of the radio access network and low bandwidth back-haul network, can not handle the exponentially increasing mobile traffic. Recently, we have seen the growth of new mechanisms of data caching and delivery methods through intermediate caching servers. In this paper, we present a survey on recent advances in mobile edge computing and content caching, including caching insertion and expulsion policies, the behavior of the caching system, and caching optimization based on wireless networks. Some of the important open challenges in mobile edge computing with content caching are identified and discussed. We have also compared edge, fog and cloud computing in terms of delay.

In order to mitigate inter-AP interference and improve spectrum efficiency, APs in UDNs are usually clustered into multiple groups to serve different mobile users, respectively. However, as the number of APs increases, the computational capability within an AP group has become the bottleneck of AP clustering. In this paper, we first propose a novel UDN architecture based on Mobile Edge Computing (MEC), in which each MEC server is associated with a user-centric AP cluster to act as a mobile agent. In addition, in the context of MEC-based UDN, we leverage mobility prediction techniques to achieve a dynamic AP clustering scheme, in which the cluster structure can automatically adapt to the dynamic distribution of user traffic in a specific area. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme can highly increase the average user throughput compared with the baseline algorithm using max-SINR user association and equal bandwidth allocation, while it guarantees at the same time low transmission delay. © 2020 Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications","AP clustering; Dynamic user traffic; Mobile edge computing; Mobility-driven; ultra-dense Networks",,,,,,"2019D02

The collected data can be used in many applications based on the analysis results of these data by cloud computing. Nowadays, data collection schemes have been widely studied by researchers. However, most of the researches take the amount of collected data into consideration without thinking about the problem of privacy leakage of the collected data. In this paper, we propose an energy-efficient and anonymous data collection scheme for MENs to keep a balance between energy consumption and data privacy, in which the privacy information of senors is hidden during data communication. In addition, the residual energy of nodes is taken into consideration in this scheme in particular when it comes to the selection of the relay node. The security analysis shows that no privacy information of the source node and relay node is leaked to attackers. Moreover, the simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme is better than other schemes in aspects of lifetime and energy consumption. At the end of the simulation part, we present a qualitative analysis for the proposed scheme and some conventional protocols. It is noteworthy that the proposed scheme outperforms the existing protocols in terms of the above indicators. © 2019 Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications","Anonymous data collection; Cloud-aided mobile edge networks; Communication model; Path selection",,,,,,"Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province

In this regard, the profiling of hate content is obtained from the results of multiple studies by quantitative and qualitative analyses. Profiling resulted in different categories of hate content caused by gender, religion, race, and disability. Based on this information, an architectural framework is developed to regulate and reduce hate content at the user's level in the mobile computing environment.

A plethora of supply chain traceability solutions based on blockchain has been proposed recently. However, current systems are limited to tracing simple goods that have not been part of the manufacturing process. We recommend a method that allows for the traceability of manufactured goods, including their components. Products are represented using non-fungible digital tokens that are created on a blockchain for each batch of manufactured products. To create a link between a product and the components that are needed to produce it, we propose “token recipes” that define the amount of tokenized goods required for minting a new token. As input tokens are automatically and transparently consumed when creating a product token, the physical process of producing a new item out of existing components is projected onto the ledger. This ultimately leads to the complete traceability of goods, including the origin of inputs. Evaluating the performance of the system, we show that a prototypical implementation for the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) scales linearly with the amount of the input and goods tracked. © 2019 Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications","Blockchain; Distributed ledger technology; Smart contract; Supply chain; Traceability",,,,,,"European Institute of Innovation and Technology, EIT: 17148-18

Eyal and E. G. Sirer. This strategy could be used by a colluding pool of miners to earn more than their fair share of the mining revenue and in consequence to force other honest miners to join them to decrease the variance of their revenues and make their monthly revenues more predictable. It is a very dangerous dynamic that could allow the rogue pool of miners to go toward a majority by accumulating powers of news adherents and control the entire network. Considering that the propagation delay of information between any two miners in the network, which is not negligible and follows a normal distribution with mean proportional to the physical distance between the two miners, and a constant variance independent of others' delays, we prove that no guarantee can be given about the success or failure of the selfish-mine attack because of the variability of information propagation in the network. © 2019 Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications","Bitcoin; Blockchain; Mining; Propagation delay of information; Selfish-mine attack",,,,,,,,"Eyal, I., Sirer, E.G., Majority is not enough: bitcoin mining is vulnerable, financial cryptography and data security (2014) 18th International Conference, FC 2014, Christ Church, Barbados, March 3-7, 2014, Revised Selected Papers, pp. 436-454; Decker, C., Wattenhofer, R., Information propagation in the bitcoin network (2013) 13th IEEE International Conference on Peer-to-Peer Computing (P2P), Trento, Italy; Rosenfeld, M., Analysis of bitcoin pooled mining reward systems, CoRR abs/1112.4980.

This research identifies peer-reviewed literature that seeks to utilize blockchain for cyber security purposes and presents a systematic analysis of the most frequently adopted blockchain security applications. Our findings show that the Internet of Things (IoT) lends itself well to novel blockchain applications, as do networks and machine visualization, public-key cryptography, web applications, certification schemes and the secure storage of Personally Identifiable Information (PII).

Since the size and shape of the antenna impact its gain/directivity, resonant frequency, bandwidth, and efficiency, the two antenna types considered in this paper are: (a) Rectangular Patch Antenna (RPA), and (b) Cylindrical Dielectric Resonator Antenna (CDRA). Here a submillimeter wave antenna is compared with a millimeter wave (a few GHz to 100 GHz) antenna. These popular mm-wave antennas are chosen for the submillimeter wave antenna in order to understand changes in their performance as the result of changes in their geometrical shape. FEldberechnung bei Korpern mit beliebiger Oberflache (FEKO) software is used for the design and calculation of the Three-Dimensional (3D) ElectroMagnetic (EM) patterns.

The simulation results indicate that the proposed 8/32 RoF-BF system provides an optimum result w.r.t. channel spacing (75 GHz), input source power (0 dBm) and number of input channels (8). In comparison with the existing RoF system, the proposed 8/32 RoF-BF system has been validated analytically and it is found that the performance of the proposed system is in close proximity particularly in FWM sideband power reduction of the order of 4 dBm for the 8-channel 32Gbps RoF system. © 2019 Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications","Dispersion compensating fiber; Four-wave mixing; Radio over Fiber; Single mode fiber; Wavelength division multiplexer",,,,,,,,"Laghezza, F., Scotti, F., Ghelfi, P., Bogoni, A., Photonics-assisted multiband rf transceiver for wireless communications (2014) J.

The objective is to minimise the total processing time of problem solving. Our load balancing with learning model distributes each Sudoku problem to an appropriate pair of worker and solver when it is received by the system. The information of the estimated solution time for a specific number of given input values, the estimated finishing time of each worker, and the idle status of each worker is used to determine the worker-solver pairs. In addition, the proposed system can estimate the waiting period for each problem. Test results show that the system has shorter processing time than conventional alternatives. © 2019 Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications","Dynamic load balancing; Learning model; Sudoku",,,,,,,,"Sudoku http://www.sudokuwiki.org/, accessed 16.11.01; Schottlender, M., The effect of guess choices on the efficiency of a backtracking algorithm in a Sudoku solver (2014) Proc.

It relies on the passive Radio-Frequency IDentification (RFID) technology to precisely track the pose of a handheld controller, and then transfer the pose information to navigate the UAV. A prototype of the handheld controller is created by attaching three or more Ultra High Frequency (UHF) RFID tags to a board. A Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) RFID reader with multiple antennas is deployed to collect the observations of the tags. First, the precise positions of all the tags can be obtained by our proposed method, which leverages a Bayesian filter and Channel State Information (CSI) phase measurements collected from the RFID reader. Second, we introduce a Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) based approach to obtain a 6-DoF (Degrees of Freedom) pose of the controller from estimated positions of the tags. Furthermore, the pose of the controller can be precisely tracked in a real-time manner, while the user moves the controller. Finally, control commands will be generated from the controller's pose and sent to the UAV for navigation. The performance of the RFHUI is evaluated by several experiments. The results show that it provides precise poses with 0.045 m mean error in position and 2.5∘ mean error in orientation for the controller, and enables the controller to precisely and intuitively navigate the UAV in an indoor environment. © 2019 Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications","Human Computer Interaction (HCI); Localization; Navigation; Radio-Frequency Identification (RFID); Singular Value Decomposition (SVD); Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)",,,,,,"National Science Foundation, NSF: CNS-1702957

In wireless communication, all WBAN nodes that monitor the human body's vital functions transfer information to a central sink node, which is directly connected to a Cognitive Radio enabled Controller called CRC. To transfer this information from a CRC to an e-health server, it requires long-range wireless networks, such as UMTS, LTE, WiMAX, WiFi, and satellite internet provider. It is challenging for a CRC to select the best networks for different WBAN data traffic, such as emergency mandatory, delay sensitive, and general monitoring. This paper proposes a scheme for selecting the best network from the available networks depending on the Quality of Service(QoS) requirements for different WBAN applications. Different multiple attribute decision-making algorithms are used in the proposed scheme. Numerical results and discussion reveal that the proposed scheme is effective in making a good network selection in situations where there is a conflict among different QoS requirements for different WBAN applications. © 2018 Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications","Cognitive radio; Entropy method; Fuzzy AHP; MADM methods; Network selection; WBAN",,,,,,,,"Negra, R., Jemili, I., Belghith, A., Wireless body area networks: applications and technologies (2016) Procedia Computer Science, 83, pp. 1274-1281; Chen, M., Gonzalez, S., Vasilakos, A., Cao, H., Leung, V.C., Body area networks: a survey (2011) Mobile Network.

We study the integration of the MEC with the NOMA to improve the computation service for the Beyond Fifth-Generation (B5G) and the Sixth-Generation (6G) wireless networks. This paper aims to minimize the energy consumption of a hybrid NOMA-assisted MEC system. In a hybrid NOMA system, a user can offload its task during a time slot shared with another user by the NOMA, and then upload the remaining data during an exclusive time duration served by Orthogonal Multiple Access (OMA). The original energy minimization problem is non-convex. To efficiently solve it, we first assume that the user grouping is given, and focuses on the one group case. Then, a multilevel programming method is proposed to solve the non-convex problem by decomposing it into three subproblems, i.e., power allocation, time slot scheduling, and offloading task assignment, which are solved optimally by carefully studying their convexity and monotonicity. The derived solution is optimal to the original problem by substituting the closed expressions obtained from those decomposed subproblems. Furthermore, we investigate the multi-user case, in which a close-to-optimal algorithm with low-complexity is proposed to form users into different groups with unique time slots. The simulation results verify the superior performance of the proposed scheme compared with some benchmarks, such as OMA and pure NOMA. © 2020 Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications","Multi-access edge computing (MEC); Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA); Resource allocation; Task assignment; User grouping",,,,,,,,"Li, H., Fang, F., Ding, Z., Joint resource allocation for NOMA-assisted MEC networks (2020) IEEE International Conference on Communications Workshops (ICC Workshops) accepted for publication, pp. 1-6; Abbas, N., Zhang, Y., Taherkordi, A., Skeie, T., Mobile edge computing: a survey (2018) IEEE Internet Things J, 5 (1), pp. 450-465; Mao, Y., You, C., Zhang, J., Huang, K., Letaief, K.B., A survey on mobile edge computing: the communication perspective (2017) IEEE Commun.

However, the effectiveness of RCC strategies is highly dependent on explicit information as regards subscribers’ content request patterns, the sophisticated caching placement policy, and the personalized recommendation tactics. In this article, we investigate how the potentials of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and optimization techniques can be harnessed to address those core issues and facilitate the full implementation of RCC for the upcoming intelligent 6G era. Towards this end, we first elaborate on the hierarchical RCC network architecture. Then, the devised AI and optimization empowered paradigm is introduced, whereas AI and optimization techniques are leveraged to predict the users’ content preferences in real-time situations with the assistance of their historical behavior data and determine the cache pushing and recommendation decision, respectively. Through extensive case studies, we validate the effectiveness of AI-based predictors in estimating users’ content preference and the superiority of optimized RCC policies over the conventional benchmarks. At last, we shed light on the opportunities and challenges in the future. © 2020 Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications","6G; Artificial intelligence; Content caching; Optimization techniques; Recommendation",,,,,,"MOE2015-T2-2-104

So far, TDL has shown its excellence in military applications. Current TDL adopts a distributed architecture to enhance anti-destruction capacity. However, It still faces a problem of data inconsistency and thus cannot well support cooperation across multiple militarily domains. To tackle this problem, we propose to leverage blockchain to build an automatic and adaptive data transmission control scheme for TDL. It achieves automatic data transmission and realizes information consistency among different TDL entities. Besides, applying smart contracts based on blockchain further enables adjusting data transmission policies automatically.

Currently, permissionless blockchain has shown a good application prospect in many fields, from the initial cryptocurrency to the Internet of Things (IoT) and Vehicular Ad-Hoc Networking (VANET), which is considered as the beginning of rewriting our digital infrastructure. However, blockchain confronts some privacy risks that hinder its practical applications. Though numerous surveys reviewed the privacy preservation in blockchain, they failed to reveal the latest advances, nor have they been able to conduct a unified standard comprehensive classification of the privacy protection of permissionless blockchain. Therefore, in this paper, we analyze the specific characteristics of permissionless blockchain, summarize the potential privacy threats, and investigate the unique privacy requirements of blockchain. Existing privacy preservation technologies are carefully surveyed and evaluated based on our proposed evaluation criteria. We finally figure out open research issues as well as future research directions from the perspective of privacy issues. © 2020 Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications","Anonymity; Blockchain; Cryptocurrency; Privacy",,,,,,"National Postdoctoral Program for Innovative Talents: BX20180238

Service providers have hosted multiple servers to ensure seamless online services to end-users. To ensure the security of this online communication, researchers have proposed several multi-server authentication schemes incorporating various cryptographic primitives. Due to the low power and computational capacities of mobile devices, the hash-based multi-server authenticated key agreement schemes with offline Registration Server (RS) are the most efficient choice. Recently, Kumar-Om presented such a scheme and proved its security against all renowned attacks. However, we find that their scheme bears an incorrect login phase, and is unsafe to the trace attack, the Session-Specific Temporary Information Attack (SSTIA), and the Key Compromise Impersonation Attack (KCIA). In fact, all of the existing multi-server authentication schemes (hash-based with offline RS) do not withstand KCIA. To deal with this situation, we propose an improved hash-based multi-server authentication scheme (with offline RS). We analyze the security of the proposed scheme under the random oracle model and use the ‘‘Automated Validation of Internet Security Protocols and Applications’’ (AVISPA) tool. The comparative analysis of communication overhead and computational complexity metrics shows the efficiency of the proposed scheme. © 2020 Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications","Authenticated key agreement; Key compromise impersonation; Multi-server architecture; One-way hash function; Registration server",,,,,,,,"Liu, Y., Zhao, Q., E-voting scheme using secret sharing and k-anonymity (2019) World Wide Web, 22 (4), pp. 1657-1667; Zhu, Y., Zhang, Y., Li, X., Yan, H., Li, J., Improved collusion-resisting secure nearest neighbor query over encrypted data in cloud (2019) Concurrency Comput.

The future sixth generation of mobile cellular networks (6G) is expected to have the capability to support new and unknown services with changing requirements. Hence, in addition to enhancing its capability by 10–100 times compared with 5G, 6G should also be intelligent and open to adapt to the ever-changing services in the IoT, which requires a convergence of Communication, Computing and Caching (3C). Based on the analysis of the requirements of new services for 6G, this paper identifies key enabling technologies for an intelligent and open 6G network, all featured with 3C convergence. These technologies cover fundamental and emerging topics, including 3C-based spectrum management, radio channel construction, delay-aware transmission, wireless distributed computing, and network self-evolution. From the detailed analysis of these 3C-based technologies presented in this paper, we can see that although they are promising to enable an intelligent and open 6G, more efforts are needed to realize the expected 6G network. © 2020 Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications","6G; Convergence of 3C; Intelligent; IoT; Open",,,,,,"National Outstanding Youth Science Fund Project of National Natural Science Foundation of China, IUSS: 61901452

In this work, we propose a new approach that takes advantage of both worlds of unsupervised and supervised learning. The main objective of the proposed approach is to enable supervised anomaly detection without the provision of the associated labels by users. To this end, we estimate the labels of each connection in the training phase using clustering. The “estimated” labels are then utilized to establish a supervised learning model for the subsequent classification of connections in the testing stage. We set up a new property that defines anomalies in the context of network anomaly detection to improve the quality of estimated labels. Through our extensive experiments with a public dataset (NSL-KDD), we will prove that the proposed method can achieve performance comparable to one with the “original” labels provided in the dataset. We also introduce two heuristic functions that minimize the impact of the randomness of clustering to improve the overall quality of the estimated labels. © 2020 Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications","Clustering randomness; Label estimation; Network anomaly detection",,,,,,"Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning, MSIP: 2016-0-00078

Several approaches were proposed in the literature, including Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP (DASH). In this work, we consider an approach in which we place sufficient emphasis on the constrained battery resources in mobile devices when making decisions on the quality (or bitrate) of the video to be requested. This is done by using a fuzzy logic controller that enhances the performance of the Fuzzy-based DASH (FDASH) scheme.

Our framework can deal with dynamic, perpetual, and large-scale microblogging streams. Specifically, we propose an online microblogging stream clustering algorithm to cluster microblogs and maintain distilled statistics called Microblog Cluster Vectors (MCV). Then we develop a ranking method to extract the most representative sentences relative to the query from the MCVs and generate a query-focused summary of arbitrary time durations. Our experiments on large-scale real microblogs demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our approach. © 2020 Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications","Computational linguistics; Microblog; Personalized pagerank; Query-focused summarization; Sentence extraction",,,,,,"CSTCCXLJRC201908

However, these tasks require a large computation load of image or video processing, which imposes enormous pressure on the UAV computation platform. To solve this issue, in this work, we propose an intelligent Task Offloading Algorithm (iTOA) for UAV edge computing network. Compared with existing methods, iTOA is able to perceive the network's environment intelligently to decide the offloading action based on deep Monte Calor Tree Search (MCTS), the core algorithm of Alpha Go. MCTS will simulate the offloading decision trajectories to acquire the best decision by maximizing the reward, such as lowest latency or power consumption. To accelerate the search convergence of MCTS, we also proposed a splitting Deep Neural Network (sDNN) to supply the prior probability for MCTS. The sDNN is trained by a self-supervised learning manager. Here, the training data set is obtained from iTOA itself as its own teacher. Compared with game theory and greedy search-based methods, the proposed iTOA improves service latency performance by 33% and 60%, respectively. © 2020 Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications","Deep reinforcement learning; Intelligent task offloading algorithm (iTOA); Mobile edge computing (MEC); Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS); Splitting deep neural network (sDNN); Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)",,,,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC: 61971107

The increasing threat of information security requires new models to ensure the safe transmission of information through such systems. Recently, quantum systems have drawn much attention since they are expected to have a significant impact on the research in information security. This paper proposes a quantum teleportation scheme based on controlled multi-users to ensure the secure information transmission among users. Quantum teleportation is an original key element in a variety of quantum information tasks as well as quantum-based technologies, which plays a pivotal role in the current progress of quantum computing and communication. In the proposed scheme, the sender transmits the information to the receiver under the control of a third user or controller. Here, we show that the efficiency of the proposed scheme depends on the properties of the transmission channel and the honesty of the controller. Compared with various teleportation scheme presented recently in the literature, the most important difference in the proposed scheme is the possibility of suspicion about the honesty of the controller and, consequently, taking proper precautions. © 2020 Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications","Information security; Intelligent secure systems; Machine-to-machine communication; Quantum networks; Quantum teleportation",,,,,,,"The authors thank Prof. Nasser Metwally, College of Science at Bahrain University, for his valuable discussion and comments during the research of this study.","Wang, F., Lei, Z., Yin, X., Li, Z., Cao, Z., Wang, Y., Information security in the smart grid: survey and challenges (2018) Geo-Spatial Knowledge and Intelligence, pp. 55-66. , Springer Singapore Singapore; Zkik, G.O., Karim, Hajji, S.E., Secure mobile multi cloud architecture for authentication and data storage (2017) International Journal of Cloud Applications and Computing, pp. 62-76. , IJCAC); Dakhnovich, A.D., Moskvin, D.A., Zegzhda, D.P., Analysis of the information security threats in the digital production networks Automat.

In the proposed protocols, two secondary sources transmit their data to a relay in the first time slot, and then the relay would forward the received information to both sources in the remaining time. Moreover, the relay is self-powered by harvesting energy from ambient Radio Frequency (RF) signals, using the Time Switching (TS) and the Power Switching (PS) method. This paper concentrates on evaluating the performance of the secondary networks under the impact of hardware impairments and co-channel interference from the primary networks. In particular, based on the secondary transmitters’ constraint power, we derive the closed-form expressions of the outage probability and the throughput over Rayleigh fading channels in two cases: TS and PS. We also investigate the energy efficiency issue and the locally optimal position of the relay to maximize the system throughput, which provides much information to install the relay location. Finally, our derivations are verified by Monte Carlo simulation. © 2020 Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications","Cognitive network; Energy efficiency; Energy harvesting; Hardware impairments; Two-way relay",,,,,,,"This research is funded by the Industrial University of Ho Chi Minh City under code 20/1.6 ĐT01 .","Varshney, L.R., Transporting information and energy simultaneously (2008) IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory, , Toronto (2008; Zhou, X., Zhang, R., Ho, C.K., Wireless information and power transfer: architecture design and rate-energy tradeoff (2013) IEEE Trans.

For this purpose, an influence maximization method that can identify influential nodes via the community structure and the influence distribution difference is proposed. Firstly, the network embedding-based community detection approach is developed, by which the social network is divided into several high-quality communities. Secondly, the solution of influence maximization is composed of the candidate stage and the greedy stage. The candidate stage is to select candidate nodes from the interior and the boundary of each community using a heuristic algorithm, and the greedy stage is to determine seed nodes with the largest marginal influence increment from the candidate set through the sub-modular property-based Greedy algorithm. Finally, experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method compared with existing methods, from which one can further find that our work can achieve a good tradeoff between the influence spread and the running time. © 2020 Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications","Community detection; Influence distribution difference; Influence maximization; Network embedding; Social network",,,,,,"1Y269

Although many efforts are made to improve the resilience to cyber attacks, there are still many unsolved challenges. This paper first identifies some major security attacks on intelligent connected vehicles. Then, we investigate and summarize the available defences against these attacks and classify them into four categories: cryptography, network security, software vulnerability detection, and malware detection.

In the broad area, connected vehicles and autonomous driving are technologies based on wireless data communication between vehicles or between vehicles and infrastructures. A Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) system consists of communications and computing over vehicles and related infrastructures. In such a system, wireless sensors are installed in some selected points along roads or driving areas. In autonomous driving, it is crucial for a vehicle to figure out the ideal routes by the communications between its equipped sensors and infrastructures then the vehicle is automatically moving along the routes. In this paper, we propose a Bezier curve based recursive algorithm, which effectively creates routes for vehicles through the communication between the On-Board Unit (OBU) and the Road-Side Units (RSUs). In addition, this approach generates a very low overhead. We conduct simulations to test the proposed algorithm in various situations. The experiment results demonstrate that our algorithm creates almost ideal routes. © 2020 Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications","Autonomous driving; Bezier curve; On board unit; Recursive algorithm; Road side unit; Vehicles and infrastructures",,,,,,"University of North Georgia, UNG","This research is supported by the Presidential Incentive Awards (No. 1103 and No. 1105) and MCCB summer research award in the University of North Georgia .","Gao, Z., Wu, Z., Ye, R., Wu, Q., ICAR hybrid network: a smart invehicle network for ScudWare (2005) Proceedings of the 1st Chinese Conference on Harmonious Human Machine Environment (HHME 05), , Kunming China; Chandra, K., Rayamajhi, D., Chowdhury, M., Bhavsar, P., Martine, J., Vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communication in a heterogeneous wireless network Performance evaluation (2016) Transport.

It is meaningful if the camera can know what, where and how the worker has performed the action in real time. In this paper, we propose a light-weight and robust algorithm to meet these requirements. By only two hands’ trajectories, our algorithm requires no graphic processing unit (GPU) acceleration, which can be used in low-cost devices. In the training stage, in order to find potential topological structures of the training trajectories, spectral clustering with eigengap heuristic is applied to cluster trajectory points. A gradient descent based algorithm is proposed to find the topological structures, which reflect main representations for each cluster. In the fine-tuning stage, a topological optimization algorithm is proposed to fine-tune the parameters of topological structures in all training data.

The security of VANETs is crucial for their successful deployment and widespread adoption. A critical aspect of preserving the security and privacy of VANETs is the efficient revocation of the ability of misbehaving or malicious vehicles to participate in the network. This is usually achieved by revoking the validity of the digital certificates of the offending nodes and by maintaining and distributing an accurate Certificate Revocation List (CRL). The immediate revocation of misbehaving vehicles is of prime importance for the safety of other vehicles and users. In this paper, we present a decentralized revocation approach based on Shamir's secret sharing to revoke misbehaving vehicles with very low delays. Besides enhancing VANETs’ security, our proposed protocol limits the size of the revocation list to the number of the revoked vehicles. Consequently, the authentication process is more efficient, and the communication overhead is reduced. We experimentally evaluate our protocol to demonstrate that it provides a reliable solution to the scalability, efficiency and security of VANETs. © 2020 Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications","Authentication; Decentralized revocation; Public key infrastructure; Security; VANETs",,,,,,,,"Asghar, M., Doss, R.R.M., Pan, L., A scalable and efficient pki based authentication protocol for vanets (2018) 2018 28th International Telecommunication Networks and Applications Conference, pp. 1-3. , IEEE; Doss, R., Alajeely, M., Al Rubeaai, S.F., Packet integrity defense mechanism in oppnets (2018) Comput.

The new bounds can apply to a wide range of discrete constellations and reveal some insights into the rate behavior at moderate to high Signal-to-Noise Ratio(SNR) values.

In this paper, we build a Bayonet-Corpus based on the context of traffic intersections, and use it to model a traffic network. Besides, Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit (Bi-GRU) is used to predict the sequence of traffic intersections in one single trajectory. Firstly, considering that real traffic networks are usually complex and disorder, and cannot reflect the higher dimensional relationship among traffic intersections, this paper proposes a new traffic network modeling algorithm based on the context of traffic intersections: inspired by the probabilistic language model, a Bayonet-Corpus is constructed from traffic intersections in real trajectory sequence, so the high-dimensional similarity between corpus nodes can be used to measure the semantic relation of real traffic intersections. This algorithm maps vehicle trajectory nodes into a high-dimensional space vector, blocking complex structure of real traffic network and reconstructing the traffic network space. Then, the bayonets sequence in real traffic network is mapped into a matrix. Considering the trajectories sequence is bidirectional, and Bi-GRU can handle information from forward and backward simultaneously, we use Bi-GRU to bidirectionally model the trajectory matrix for the purpose of prediction. © 2020 Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications","Bayonet-corpus; Bidirectional gated recurrent unit; Traffic network modeling; Trajectory prediction",,,,,,"Chongqing Municipal Education Commission, CQMEC: KJZD-K201900603, KJQN201900629

With features extracted from the network traffic, a new detection approach based on multi-feature fusion is proposed to solve the problem in this paper. An attack feature set containing the Acknowledge character(ACK) sequence number, the packet size, and the queue length is used to classify normal and LDoS attack traffics. Each feature is digitalized and preprocessed to fit the input of the K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) classifier separately, and to obtain the decision contour matrix. Then a posteriori probability in the matrix is fused, and the fusion decision index D is used as the basis of detecting the LDoS attacks. Experiments proved that the detection rate of the multi-feature fusion algorithm is higher than those of the single-based detection method and other algorithms. © 2020 Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications","Attack features; KNN classifier; Low-rate denial of service attacks; Multi-feature fusion",,,,,,"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities: 3122019051

In this paper, we derive some novel and approximate mathematical expressions for the lower bound of the SE of a Ma-MIMO with linear precoding schemes, i.e., Minimum Mean Square Error (MMSE) and Zero-Forcing (ZF). For simulation analysis of the SE, we consider three joint users and antenna scheduling algorithms, namely, the semi-orthogonal, random, and distance-based user scheduling algorithms, whereas the antennas are selected based on Maximum Signal to Noise Ratio (MSNR) with scheduled users. The channel between the user and the transmitter is assumed to have characteristics of Small Scale Fading (SSF) and Large Scale Fading (LSF) with Rayleigh fading model. We investigate the effect of the variation of transmitting SNR, the number of base station antennas (M), and the radius (R) of the cell area on the SE. We simulate the downlink transmission of Ma-MIMO and compare the simulation and analytical results. It is observed that the trends of variation of both results are similar to the variation of identical factors, and the difference between the simulated and analytical lower bounds of the SE is approximately 1–1.5 bits. The analytical lower bound is smaller than the simulation result. © 2020 Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications","Fifth-generation; LSF coefficient; Ma-MIMO; Precoding; Spectral efficiency",,,,,,"Ministry of Electronics and Information technology, Meity: PhD-MLA-4(96)/2015–2016","We hereby acknowledge the financial support of the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (Meity) , Government of India, in this research work.

In this paper, we propose a compression-encryption model to solve these problems. This model consists of three processes. The first process is the dynamic symmetric key generation. The second one is the compression process, which is followed by encryption using keystreams and S-Boxes that are generated using a chaotic logistic map. The last process is the symmetric key distribution. The symmetric key is encrypted twice using Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA) to provide both authentication and confidentiality. Then, it is inserted into the cipher image using the End of File (EoF) method. The evaluation shows that the symmetric key generator model can produce a random and dynamic symmetric key. Hence, the image data is safe from ciphertext-only attacks. This model is fast and able to withstand entropy attacks, statistical attacks, differential attacks, and brute-force attacks. © 2020 Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications","Chaotic logistic map; Compression-encryption; End of file; S-Box; Symmetric key distribution",,,,,,"Kementerian Riset, Teknologi dan Pendidikan Tinggi","This research is partially supported by the Ministry of Research, Technology and Higher Education of the Republic of Indonesia by the Doctoral Dissertation Grant.","Hamdi, M., Rhouma, R., Belghith, S., A selective compression-encryption of images based on SPIHT coding and Chirikov Standard Map (2017) Signal Process., 131, pp. 514-526; Setyaningsih, E., Harjoko, A., Survey of hybrid image compression techniques (2017) Int.

Both Equal Gain Combining (EGC) and optimal combination of the aforementioned detectors are investigated in cooperative and non-cooperative spectrum sensing scenarios. In packet transmission systems such as OFDM (Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple access) systems, the proposed scheme takes advantage of utilizing more samples than individual detectors, i.e., cyclic prefix, training or pilot samples, and data payload samples. The proposed combine-sensing scheme offers higher detection probability and lower false alarm probability, as compared with the performance of individual detectors over the same frame duration.

However, a major problem practically encountered in a BPMR system is Inter-Track Interference (ITI) that can deteriorate the overall system performance, especially at high ADs. This paper proposes an iterative ITI cancellation method for an m-head m-track BPMR system, which uses m heads to read m adjacent tracks and decodes them simultaneously. To cancel the ITI, we subtract the weighted readback signals of adjacent tracks, acting as the ITI signals, from the readback signal of the target track, before passing the refined readback signal to a turbo decoder. Then, the decoded data will be employed to reconstruct the ITI signal for the next turbo iteration. Experimental results indicate that the proposed system performs better than the conventional system that uses one head to read one data track. Furthermore, we also find out that the proposed system is more robust to media noise and track misregistration than the conventional system. © 2020 Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications","Emerging magnetic recording technology; Inter-track interference; Multi-head multi-track; Turbo decoder",,,,,,"GP_62_12

The interference and energy consumption increase rapidly with the number of SBSs although each SBS transmits with small power. In this paper, we model a downlink heterogeneous ultra-dense network where a lot of SBSs are randomly deployed with MBSs based on the Poisson point process. We derive the coverage probability and its variance, and analyze the area spectral efficiency and energy efficiency of the network considering three Fractional Power Control (FPC) strategies. The numerical results and Monte Carlo simulation results show that power control can mitigate the interference and balance the performances of inner-user and edge-user equipments. Especially, a great improvement of energy efficiency is archived with a little loss of area spectral efficiency when FPC is adopted. Finally, we analyze the effect of base stations’ (BSs’) sleeping on the performance of the network when it is partially loaded. © 2020 Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications","Area spectral efficiency; Coverage probability; Energy efficiency; Heterogeneous ultra-dense network; Poisson point process",,,,,,"61831004","This work was supported in part by the Major Program of the National Nature Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 61831004 ).","Chen, S., Zhao, J., The requirements, challenges, and technologies for 5G of terrestrial mobile telecommunication (2014) IEEE Commun.

In this study, we propose a novel analog visual communications system, named DVCast, in which an image denoising algorithm is used to fully utilize spatial correlation; moreover, the variable block size Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) is used to preserve more correlation information in an image. Obviously, there is a tradeoff between system performance and computing complexity. Therefore, to improve the real-time performance of the proposed system, implementation of Block Matching with 3D filtering (BM3D) and DCT by Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) is introduced. According to DCT block size, i.e., 8×8, 16×16, and 32×32, the schemes DVCast8, DVCast16, and DVCast32, respectively, are designed and implemented. Simulations show that DVCast with larger block size achieves better gain and visual quality than reference schemes. Moreover, it requires less computing time. DVCast32 outperforms conventional digital schemes by approximately 3.51 ​dB and achieves a 1.12 ​dB gain over state-of-the-art reference schemes. Furthermore, the analysis shows that DVCast can reduce overhead by at least 75%. © 2019 Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications","Analog visual communications; DCT; Graphics processing units; Image de-noising",,,,,,"20151BBE50076

The effect of severe ITI may be mitigated by using coding schemes. In this paper, therefore, we present a rate-5/6 2-Dimensional (2D) modulation code based on a proposed Single-Reader/Two-track Reading (SRTR) technique to cope with this serious problem in staggered Bit-Patterned Magnetic Recording (BPMR) systems. We then evaluate the Bit-Error Rate (BER) performance of the proposed system in the presence of media noises, e.g., position and size fluctuations. Our simulation results indicate that, at the same User Density (UD), the proposed system performs better than an uncoded system by about 1.0 ​dB ​at the BER of 10−5 and is also superior to the conventional recording system. © 2019 Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications","2D interference; 2D modulation code; Bit-patterned media recording; Single-reader/two-track reading",,,,,,"Thailand Research Fund, TRF: RSA6080051

A large quantities of resources (time, man power, infrastructure, etc.) are often invested in programming, interfacing the sensors, debugging the response to algorithms during prototyping and operational phases of a robot development cycle. The cost of developing an optimal infrastructure to efficiently address such control and monitoring requirements increases significantly in the presence of mobile robots. Though numerous solutions have been developed for minimizing the resources spent on hardware prototyping and algorithm validation in both static and mobile scenarios, it can be observed that researchers have either chosen methodologies that conflict with the power and infrastructure constraints of the research field or generated constrained solutions whose applications are restricted to the field itself. This paper develops a solution for addressing the challenges in controlling heterogeneous mobile robots. A platform named Quanta - a cost effective, energy efficient and high-speed wireless infrastructure is prototyped as a part of the research in the field of modular robotics. Quanta is capable of controlling and monitoring various events in/using a robot with the help of a light-weight communication protocol independent of the robot hardware architecture(s). © 2020 Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications","Centralized/decentralized communication; Concurrent control and monitoring; Event scheduling; modular robotics; Swarm robotics",,,,,,,,"Arumugam, S., Kalle, R.K., Prasad, A.R., Wireless robotics: opportunities and challenges (2013) Wirel.

Various blockchain consensus mechanisms have been proposed. However, there is no technical analysis and comparison as a guideline to determine which type of consensus mechanism should be adopted in a specific scenario/application. To this end, this work investigates three mainstream consensus mechanisms in the blockchain, namely, Proof of Work (PoW), Proof of Stake (PoS), and Direct Acyclic Graph (DAG), and identifies their performances in terms of the average time to generate a new block, the confirmation delay, the Transaction Per Second (TPS) and the confirmation failure probability. The results show that the consensus process is affected by both network resource (computation power/coin age, buffer size) and network load conditions. In addition, it shows that PoW and PoS are more sensitive to the change of network resource while DAG is more sensitive to network load conditions. © 2020 Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications","Blockchain; Direct acyclic graph; Performance comparison; Proof of stake; Proof of work",,,,,,"Chongqing Research Program of Basic Research and Frontier Technology: cstc2017jcyjBX0005

In this framework, an information proprietor drives out its information to a cloud database professional company. To offer information security, the Data-Owner (DO) encrypts the delicate information before transmission at the cloud database professional company end. Current encryption ideas, nonetheless, are just halfway homomorphic as all of them intend to enable an explicit kind of calculation, which is accomplished on scrambled information. These current plans can't be coordinated to solve genuine functional queries that include activities of various types. We propose and evaluate a Verifiable Reliable Secure-DataBase (VRS-DB) framework on shared tables along with many primary operations on scrambled information, which enables information interoperability, and permits an extensive possibility of Structured Query Language (SQL) queries to be prepared by the service provider on the encoded data. We show that our security and privacy idea is protected from two forms of threats and are fundamentally proficient. © 2019 Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications","Cloud storage; Cryptography; Encrypted query; Privacy; Security; Sensitive data",,,,,,,,"Wang, H., He, D., Yu, J., Wang, Z., Incentive and unconditionally anonymous identity-based public provable data possession (2018) IEEE Transactions on Services Computing, , 1–1; Wang, H., He, D., J.

RFID empowers end-to-end and item-by-item visibility, letting the customers or decision makers effectively trail the personnel and resources for improved management. Significant research and development in this area have transformed the inexpensive, miniaturized technology of RFIDs without chip inside. Chipless Radio Frequency IDentification (CRFID) is a striking wireless technology based on radar principle to sense, identify and track the objects. CRFIDs are simplified and miniaturized tags of traditional RFID, which can widely be used in small and cheap objects/applications in our daily life. This paper reviews the definition, principle, and most recent development in CRFIDs. Based on the reported researches, ElectroMagnetic Spectrum (EMS) method is typical, which has been concerned by many RFID researchers. Therefore, this paper reviews different types of EMS CRFID tag and classifies tags based on structure design emphasizing on their significant geometries versus performance parameters. Antenna and coding method of the EMS CRFID are also elaborated, contrasting the tag capacity and coding performance. Finally, we simply summarize the challenges and limitations in this emerging field and present the prospects of future CRFID. © 2020 Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications","Coding; CRFID; Electromagnetic; Tag structure",,,,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC: 51607168, 61872038","This work was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China ( 61872038 ).

Low computational cost algorithms for user and antenna selection significantly may enhance the system capacity, as it would consume a smaller bandwidth out of the total bandwidth for downlink transmission. The objective of this paper is to maximize the system sum-rate capacity with efficient user and antenna selection algorithms and linear precoding. We consider in this paper, a slowly fading Rayleigh channel with perfect acquisition of CSI to explore the system sum-rate capacity of a massive MIMO network. For user selection, we apply three algorithms, namely Semi-orthogonal user selection (SUS), descending order-based user scheduling (DOSUS), and Random user selection (RUS) algorithm. In all the user selection algorithms, the selection of base station (BS) antenna is based on maximum signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) to the selected users. Hence users are characterized by having both small scale fading (SSF) due to slowly fading Rayleigh channel and large-scale fading (LSF) due to distances from the base station. Further, we use linear precoding techniques such as zero forcing (ZF), minimum mean square error (MMSE), and maximum ratio transmission (MRT) to reduce interferences thereby improving average system sum-rate capacity. Results using SUS, DOSUS, and RUS user selection algorithms with ZF, MMSE, and MRT precoding techniques are compared. We also analyzed and compared the computational complexity of all the three user selection algorithms. The computational complexities of the three algorithms that we achieved in this paper are O(1) for RUS and DOSUS, and O(M2N) for SUS which are less than the other conventional user selection methods. © 2019 Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications","5G; Antenna selection; Complexity; DOSUS and antenna selection; Massive MIMO; User selection",,,,,,"Ministry of Electronics and Information technology, Meity","The authors hereby acknowledge the financial support of the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology Govt. of India , in this research work (Grant PhD-MLA-4(96)/2015–2016 ).","Marzetta, T.L., Noncooperative cellular wireless with unlimited numbers of base station antennas (2010) IEEE Trans.

With personal financial and medical information and job-related data processed on mobile devices, systems and networks as well as the connected mobile cloud, it is critically important that secure mobile operating systems, secure mobile applications, secure smartphone devices, secure cellular networks and secure mobile cloud all keep up with the ever-growing mobile usage. For this reason, this research area has been a very important section in the field of network, telecommunication and industry, as well as a focus of many funded research projects at research institutes. The scope of the special issue on “The Security, Privacy, and Digital Forensics of Mobile Networks and Mobile Cloud” encompasses the security, privacy, and digital forensics of mobile systems, mobile networks and mobile cloud, including but not limited to operating systems of Android, iOS and Windows Mobile, smartphones and applications for these platforms and devices, as well as cellular networks, mobile cloud and related applications. This special issue has gone through a rigorous review process and finally accepted six papers, which are briefly introduced as follows. The first paper, entitled “A data reduction scheme for active authentication of smartphone owners using informative apps ranking” by Abdulaziz Alzubaidi et al., explores an active authentication method based solely on app usage patterns of a legitimate user using machine learning. From an unconventional perspective, this study experimentally establishes that observing the usage behavior of a user in the short-term is almost equally effective in predicting legitimate users. Access control is a critical aspect of data security, particularly so for health data. The second paper, entitled “A service-based RBAC & MAC approach incorporated into the FHIR standard” by Yaira Rivera Sanchez et al., proposes the use of Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) and Mandatory Access Control (MAC) to define permissions based on role and/or the sensitivity level of services. This is implemented at the model level incorporated into the FHIR standard using RESTful APIs. The third paper, entitled “Anonymous crowdsourcing based on WLAN indoor localization” by Yiyao Liu et al., proposes an anonymous crowdsourcing approach protecting location privacy for WLAN indoor localization. The approach is capable of constructing a physically-labeled mobility map from the sporadically-collected crowdsourced motion traces as well as achieving satisfactory localization accuracy in a cost-efficient manner. The fourth paper, entitled “Secrecy sum-rate analysis of massive MIMO systems under dual-threat attacks using normalization methods” by Kishan Neupane and Rami Haddad, considers a closed-form approximation for the ergodic achievable secrecy sum-rate. Observations, including better vector and matrix performances, can be achieved with ZF precoding in high SNR, while MRT outperforms ZF in low SNR. The fifth paper, entitled “AdaptiveMutate: a technique for privacy preservation” by Iouma Chaddad et al., proposes a privacy-leak thwarting technique to defend against statistical traffic analysis of apps. Specifically, this is implemented by obfuscating packet lengths and/or inter-arrival time information leaked by mobile traffic, making it difficult for intruders to differentiate between altered app traffic and the actual one using statistical analysis. The spatio-temporal nature of Call Detailed Records (CDR) makes it valuable for mobile forensic investigations. The sixth paper entitled “Development of multiple mobile networks CDR and its forensic analysis” by Emmanuel Abba et al. focuses on identifying and conceptually modeling six new artifacts generated from CDR across Multiple Mobile Networks (MMN). This enables efficient capturing of the required data for forensic analysis and reveals an increased time efficiency, higher accuracy and completeness percentage over the existing approaches. Our appreciation is given to all authors who have submitted their works to this issue, and particularly to authors of the accepted papers for their efforts, cooperation, and patience. We want to thank all paper reviewers for their time and efforts and providing constructive comments and suggestions. This special issue would not have been successful without the continuous support from the DCN Executive Associate Editor Dr. Yun Li, and Managing Editor Ms. Yi Guo.

The evolution of information and communication technology towards 5G is promising, but there is still a lot of space for more inventions as it evolves based on the user requirement, which changes from time to time. And there is also plenty of room for Artificial Intelligence and machine learning to do a better and smarter job as we go to 5G, and anticipate traffic as well, not just react. Learning and Analysis mechanisms play a vital role in the next generation of emerging technologies like IoT and Machine to Machine. Moreover, green convergence, smart screen & appliances, next-generation broadcasting and media, mobile convergence networks approaches will perceive the customer behavior and the way it correlates with events within and beyond of the network. Thus, the emerging technologies will be a key part of each mobile operator's intelligent infrastructure and can be foundational for 5G. This issue of “Evolution of Information and Communication Technology towards 5G: New Emerging Areas, Technologies, Protocols and Applications” under Digital Communications And Networks (DCAN) consists of five papers. There are two papers among them which cover the LTE-WiFi offloading in 5G networks and data privacy in the cloud environment. In the one paper entitled “SDN assisted Stackelberg game model for LTE-WIFI offloading in 5G networks,” Sudha Anbalagan et al. present a game model to balance the trade-off between the economic incentive of LTE macro base station and the AP's admit load to achieve optimal offloading during LTE-WLAN Aggregation (LWA) using Software Defined Networking (SDN) model. In another paper titled “EECDH to prevent MITM attack in cloud computing,” Shajina Anand et al. designed a unique algorithm for authentication and data privacy in a multi-owner cloud environment that provides cost-efficient and consistent data storage. The other three papers cover load distribution in SDN, vertical handover approach for heterogeneous networks, load balancing for cloud radio access, and network architecture. In the paper titled “On the use of the genetic programming for balanced load distribution in software-defined networks,” Amin Badirzadeh et al. proposed an effective load balancing scheme in SDN to distribute workload across servers in data centers using a genetic programming approach, called Genetic Programming based Load Balancing (GPLB). To choose the real-time least loaded path, GPLB immediately calculates the integrated load of paths based on the information that receives from the SDN controller. In the paper titled “A novel modeling approach for vertical handover based on dynamic k-partite graph in heterogeneous networks,” a new approach based on the k-partite graph is proposed by Mohamed Lahby et al. to model the vertical handover problem for heterogeneous wireless networks. Here, the selection of the best path is performed by a robust and lightweight mechanism based on the cost function and Dijkstra's algorithm. In the paper titled “CLB: A multilevel co-operative load balancing algorithm for C-RAN architecture,” Byomakesh Mahapatra et al. examine the different load situations and mathematically formulate the corresponding load balancing situation at both Remote Radio Head (RRH) and Base Band Unit (BBU) pool. For real-time handling of cellular traffic, an advance Co-operative Load Balancing (CLB) algorithm is proposed, which can balance the load at RRH as well as at BBU-pool.

SDN uses a controller that has a global view of the network and switch devices which act as packet forwarding hardware, known as “OpenFlow switches”. Since load balancing service is essential to distribute workload across servers in data centers, we propose an effective load balancing scheme in SDN, using a genetic programming approach, called Genetic Programming based Load Balancing (GPLB). We formulate the problem to find a path: 1) with the best bottleneck switch which has the lowest capacity within bottleneck switches of each path, 2) with the shortest path, and 3) requiring the less possible operations. For the purpose of choosing the real-time least loaded path, GPLB immediately calculates the integrated load of paths based on the information that receives from the SDN controller. Hence, in this design, the controller sends the load information of each path to the load balancing algorithm periodically and then the load balancing algorithm returns a least loaded path to the controller. In this paper, we use the Mininet emulator and the OpenDaylight controller to evaluate the effectiveness of the GPLB. The simulative study of the GPLB shows that there is a big improvement in performance metrics and the latency and the jitter are minimized. The GPLB also has the maximum throughput in comparison with related works and has performed better in the heavy traffic situation. The results show that our model stands smartly while not increasing further overhead. © 2019 Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications","Load balancing; Mininet; OpenDaylight; OpenFlow; Software-defined networking",,,,,,,,"Chen-Xiao, C., Xu, Y.-B., Research on load balance method in SDN (2016) Int.

The spatio-temporal nature of CDR makes them a valuable dataset used for forensic activities. Advances in technology have led to the seamless communication across Multiple Mobile Network (MMN), which poses a threat to the availability and integrity of CDR data. Present CDR implementation is capable of logging peer-to-peer communications over single connection only, thus necessitating improvements on how the CDR data is stored for forensic analysis. In this paper, the problem is solved by identifying and conceptually modelling six new artifacts generated by such communication activities. The newly identified artifacts are introduced into the existing CDR for an incident capturing of the required data for forensic analysis during investigations involved in the MMN communication. Results show an improved absolute speed of 0.0058 s for the MMN-CDR to associate a suspect with an incident, which is 0.0038 s faster than the speed of 0.0097s for the existing CDR to associate a suspect with an accomplice. Thus, a novel method for forensically tracking calls over the MMN has been developed. The MMN-CDR, when forensically analyzed, reveals an increase in time efficiency over the existing CDR due to its high absolute speed. Also, higher accuracy and completeness percentage are both obtained. © 2019 Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications","CDR; Investigation; Multiple mobile networks; Suspect",,,,,,,,"Khan, M.E., Ali, Dev, H., A hierarchical approach for identifying user activity patterns from mobile phone call detail records (2015) Paper Presented at the 2015 International Conference on Networking Systems and Security (NSysS); Kumar, M., Hanumanthappa, M., Kumar, S., Crime investigation and criminal network analysis using archive call detail records (2017) Paper Presented at the 2016 Eighth International Conference on Advanced Computing (ICoAC); Afif, O., Braun, V., Hidekazu, T., Marsch, P., Schotten, H., Tullberg, H., The foundation of the mobile and wireless communications system for 2020 and beyond: challenges, enablers and technology solutions (2013) Paper Presented at the Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring), 2013 IEEE 77th; Chemello, N., Correlating CDR with other data sources (2016) Paper Presented at the 2016 IEEE International Conference on Cybercrime and Computer Forensic (ICCCF); Ding, L., Gu, J., Wang, Y., Wu, J., Analysis of telephone call detail records based on Fuzzy decision tree (2011) Forensics in Telecommunications, Information, and Multimedia: Third International ICST Conference, e-Forensics 2010, Shanghai, China, November 11-12, 2010, Revised Selected Papers, pp. 301-311. , X.

First of all, the crowdsourced motion traces with similar Received Signal Strength(RSS) sequences are assembled into a motion graph. Second, the mobility map is constructed according to traces segmentation and clustering. Third, the pixel template matching is adopted to physically label the pre-constructed mobility map. Finally, the robust Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) is designed to perform localization by matching the newly-collected RSS measurements against the mobility map. The extensive experimental results show that the proposed approach is capable of constructing a physically-labeled mobility map from the sporadically-collected crowdsourced motion traces as well as achieving satisfactory localization accuracy in a cost-efficient manner. © 2019 Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications","Crowdsourcing; Mobility map; Pixel template matching; Robust extended Kalman Filter; WLAN localization",,,,,,"KJZH17117

In support of HIE, the Health Level Seven (HL7) XML standard was developed to manage, exchange, integrate, and retrieve electronic health information. In 2011, the Fast Healthcare Interoperable Resources (FHIR) standard, based on HL7, was proposed to facilitate the development of mobile Health (mHealth) apps with HIT data sharing via a common modeling format. FHIR utilizes RESTful APIs enabled with a FHIR server for information usage and exchange in the cloud. FHIR has a security specification, but does not define actual security mechanisms for secure data exchange via service invocations. If services are the primary means of access, there must be a way to control who can invoke which service at which time. This paper proposes the use of Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) and Mandatory Access Control (MAC) to define permissions based on role and/or the sensitivity level of services. This is accomplished by evolving RBAC and MAC to support permissions on services (as opposed to the usual object view) at a model level applied to a setting where a mobile application is using RESTful APIs. The resulting service-based model is incorporated into the FHIR standard to control the access of who can invoke which services of FHIR RESTful APIs that manage the sensitive healthcare data; work is demonstrated via an mHealth application that interacts with the OpenEMR HIT system via the HAPI FHIR server. © 2019 Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications","Access control; FHIR; Healthcare systems; MAC; Mobile applications; RBAC",,,,,,,,"Heisey-Grove, D., Patel, V., Any, certified, and basic: quantifying Physician EHR adoption through 2014 (2015), https://www.healthit.gov/sites/default/files/briefs/oncdatabrief28_certified_vs_ basic.pdf, [Online].

But data privacy and communication issues will occur with the increment of the cloud data storage. The key privacy concern for scalability is caused by the dynamic membership allocation and multi-owner data sharing. This paper addresses the issues faced by multiple owners through a mutual authentication mechanism using the Enhanced Elliptic Curve Diffie - Hellman (EECDH) key exchange protocol along with the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA). The proposed EECDH scheme is used to exchange the secured shared key among multiple owners and also to eliminate the Man-In-The-Middle (MITM) attacks with less computational complexity. By leveraging these algorithms, the integrity of data sharing among multiple owners is ensured. The EECDH improves the level of security only slightly increasing the time taken to encrypt and decrypt the data, and it is secured against the MITM attacks, which is experimented using the AVISPA tool. © 2019 Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications","Cloud computing; Diffie-hellman key exchange protocol; Elliptic curve digital signature algorithm; Enhanced elliptic curve diffie hellman; Multi-owner; Station to station protocol",,,,,,,,"Shajina, A.R., Varalakshmi, P., A novel dual authentication protocol (DAP) for multi-owners in cloud computing (2017) Springer Cluster Computing, 20 (1), pp. 507-523; Bethencourt, J., Sahai, A., Waters, B., Ciphertext-policy Attribute-Based Encryption (2007), pp. 321-334. , IEEE Symposium Security and Privacy; Lynn, B., Pbc Library the Pairing-Cryptography Library (2014); Boneh, D., Boyen, X., Shacham, H., Short group signatures (2004) Annual International Cryptology Conference, pp. 41-55; Lee, C.C., Chung, P.S., Hwang, M.S., A survey on attribute-based encryption schemes of access control in cloud environments (2013) IJ Network Security, 15 (4), pp. 231-240; Varalakshmi, P., Shajina, A.R., SMOADS-secured multi-owner attribute-based data sharing in cloud computing (2013) 5th International Conference on Advanced Computing (ICoAC), pp. 318-324; Shajina, A.R., Varalakshmi, P., MODS: integrated framework for secured multi-owner data sharing in cloud computing (2016) J.

The MBS cannot accommodate all user's demands, and attempts to offload some users to the nearby small cells so that the user could get the expected service. For the MBS to offload data traffic to an Access Point (AP), it should offer an optimal economic incentive in a way its utility is maximized. Similarly, the APs should choose an optimal traffic to admit load for the price that it gets from MBS. To balance this tradeoff between the economic incentive and the admittance load to achieve optimal offloading, Software Defined Networking (SDN) assisted Stackelberg Game (SaSG) model is proposed. In this model, the MBS selects the users carefully to aggregate the service with AP, so that the user experiencing least service gets aggregated first. The MBS uses the Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) value of the users as the main parameter for aggregating a particular user for a contract period with LTE and WiFi. Each player involved in the game tries to maximize their payoff utilities, and thus, while incorporating those utilities in real-time scenario, we obtain maximum throughput per user which experiences best data service without any lack in Quality of Experience (QoE). Thus, the proposed SaSG model proves better when compared with other game theory models, and hence an optimal data offloading is achieved. © 2019 Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications","Aggregation; LTE; Software Defined Networking; Stackelberg Game; WiFi",,,,,,"Department of Science and Technology, Government of Kerala

Our proposed SaSG approach suggests an efficient way to aggregate traffic, which in turn provides seamless data offloading so that the users does not experience any quantifiable quality issues. The proposed game theoretical approach choose the MBS and the APs as players with SDN as the information entity. A non-cooperative offloading game, in which all of the players try to maximize their utilities, is modeled. The proposed AALC and MIC algorithms provide the best ways to maximize the utilities of all players. From the simulation results, it is clear that compared with the existing system we have achieved a good improvement in various aggregating parameters like delay reduction, optimal economic incentive value fixation and higher UE throughput. Thus, our proposed SaSG model provides seamless data offloading.

Despite the presence of encryption, passive network adversaries who have access to the network infrastructure can eavesdrop on the traffic and therefore fingerprint a user's app by means of packet-level traffic analysis. Since it is difficult to prevent the adversaries from accessing the network, providing secrecy in hostile environments becomes a serious concern. In this study, we propose AdaptiveMutate, a privacy-leak thwarting technique to defend against the statistical traffic analysis of apps. First, we present a method for the identification of mobile apps using traffic analysis. Further, we propose a confusion system in which we obfuscate packet lengths, and/or inter-arrival time information leaked by the mobile traffic to make it hard for intruders to differentiate between the altered app traffic and the actual one using statistical analysis. Our aim is to shape one class of app traffic to obscure its features with the minimum overhead. Our system strives to dynamically maximize its efficiency by matching each app with the corresponding most dissimilar app. Also, AdaptiveMutate has an adaptive capability that allows it to choose the most suitable feature to mutate, depending on the type of apps analyzed and the classifier used, if known. We evaluate the efficiency of our model by conducting a comprehensive simulation analysis that mutates different apps to each other using AdaptiveMutate. We conclude that our algorithm is most efficient when we mutate a feature of one app to its most dissimilar one in another app. When applying the identification technique, we achieve a classification accuracy of 91.1%. Then, using our obfuscation technique, we are able to reduce this accuracy to 7%. Also, we test our algorithm against a recently published approach for mobile apps classification and we are able to reduce its accuracy from 94.8% to 17.9%. Additionally, we analyze the tradeoff between the shaping cost and traffic privacy protection, specifically, the associated overhead and the feasibility for real-time implementation. © 2019 Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications","App profiling; Inter-arrival time; Obfuscation; Packet length statistics; Side-channel information; Traffic classification",,,,,,,"Research funded by the AUB University Research Board , and TELUS Corp., Canada .","C.

The rapid growth of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) needs a common cellular platform to increase the network's extensibility and adaptability. The Cloud Radio Access Network (C-RAN) offers a scalable and flexible Base Station (BS) architecture for the next-generation wireless and mobile networks, where the BS functionality is split into a distributed radio unit known as Remote Radio Head (RRH) and a Centralized BaseBand Unit (C-BBU). To further make the C-BBU scalable and flexible, the baseband signal processing is carried out over a virtualized platform. The load at the RRH and C-BBU can vary from under-loaded to overloaded conditions which increase the power consumption and degrade the Quality-of-Service (QoS) of the C-RAN. In this paper, we formulate under-loaded and overloaded conditions at the RRH and the C-BBU, and propose a Co-operative Load Balancing (CLB) algorithm for handling the cellular traffic in real-time under different load conditions. The proposed CLB aims to maximize the utilization of hardware resources at the RRH and C-BBU. The CLB algorithm is compared with CDI, CZ, NDLB, DLB in the first phase for the RF load balancing. In the second phase of simulation, CLB is compared with the FCFS, IWRR, OLB, GP and TLB algorithms for server (C-BBU) load balancing. The parameters considered for comparison are: User Entity (UE) waiting time, blocking probability and processing time at the RRH and the C-BBU. Simulation results show that the use of co-operative load balancing technique improves the QoS in the C-RAN by reducing the blocking probability and UE waiting time. The CLB algorithm is validated with LTE TU-Vienna and cloudSim simulators for the RRH and the C-BBU, respectively. © 2019 Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications","C-BBU; C-RAN; CLB; Load balancing; RRH",,,,,,,,"Chih-Lin, I., Rowell, C., Han, S., Xu, Z., Li, G., Pan, Z., Toward green and soft: a 5 G perspective (2014) IEEE Commun.

At the same time, the development of new devices equipped with multiple interfaces is growing rapidly in recent years. As a consequence, the vertical handover protocol is developed in order to provide ubiquitous connectivity in the heterogeneous wireless environment. Indeed, by using this protocol, the users have opportunities to be connected to the Internet through a variety of wireless technologies at any time and anywhere. The main challenge of this protocol is how to select the best access network in terms of Quality of Service (QoS) for users. For that, many algorithms have been proposed and developed to deal with the issue in recent studies. However, all existing algorithms permit only the selection of one access network from the available networks during the vertical handover process. To cope with this problem, in this paper we propose a new approach based on k-partite graph. Firstly, we introduce k-partite graph theory to model the vertical handover problem. Secondly, the selection of the best path is performed by a robust and lightweight mechanism based on cost function and Dijkstra's algorithm. The experimental results show that the proposed approach can achieve better performance of QoS than the existing algorithms for FTP traffic and video streaming. © 2019 Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications","Cost function; Heterogeneous wireless networks; K-partite graph; Mininet; QoS; Vertical handover",,,,,,,"We appreciate and would like to thank the anonymous referees for their constructive comments and suggestions to improve the quality of this work.","Li, S., Da Xu, L., Zhao, S., 5G Internet of things: a survey (2018) J.

Active authentication based on behavioral biometrics is a solution to protect the privacy of data in smart devices. Machine-learning-based frameworks are effective for active authentication. However, the success of any machine-learning-based techniques depends highly on the relevancy of the data in hand for training. In addition, the training time should be very efficient. Keeping in view both issues, we've explored a novel fraudulent user detection method based solely on the app usage patterns of legitimate users. We hypothesized that every user has a unique pattern hidden in his/her usage of apps. Motivated by this observation, we've designed a way to obtain training data, which can be used by any machine learning model for effective authentication. To achieve better accuracy with reduced training time, we removed data instances related to any specific user from the training samples which did not contain any apps from the user-specific priority list. An information theoretic app ranking scheme was used to prepare a user-targeted apps priority list. Predictability of each instance related to a candidate app was calculated by using a knockout approach. Finally, a weighted rank was calculated for each app specific to every user. Instances with low ranked apps were removed to derive the reduced training set. Two datasets as well as seven classifiers for experimentation revealed that our reduced training data significantly lowered the prediction error rates in the context of classifying the legitimate user of a smartphone. © 2019 Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications","Behavioral biometric; Classification; Fraudulent user; Machine learning; Smartphone security",,,,,,,,"Roth, V., Richter, K., Freidinger, R., A pin-entry method resilient against shoulder surfing (2004) Proceedings of the 11th ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security, pp. 236-245. , ACM; Fridman, L., Weber, S., Greenstadt, R., Kam, M., Active authentication on mobile devices via stylometry application usage Web browsing and GPS location (2016) IEEE Syst.

This paper derives a closed-form approximation for the Ergodic Achievable Secrecy Sum-Rate (EASSR) by considering the joint impact of eavesdroppers and jammers. Two widely used linear precoding techniques, Zero-Forcing (ZF) and Maximum Ratio Transmission (MRT), were used in conjunction with matrix and vector normalization to analyze the secrecy performance. Closed-form expressions are used to explain how the secrecy performance is affected when using the ZF and MRT precoding in the eavesdropping and jamming attack models. We also analyze and compare the performances of different combinations of normalization method and precoding technique in various scenarios. From the analytical expressions and simulation results, we observe that the vector and matrix normalization perform better for the ZF precoding than for the MRT precoding in high Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) scenarios. However, in low SNR, the MRT with matrix normalization outperforms the ZF with vector normalization regardless of the number of users in the system. Further, we observe that the MRT fails to serve more than two users in high SNR scenario. Numerical results obtained from Monte Carlo simulation are used to corroborate the accuracy of the asymptotic secrecy analysis. © 2019 Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications","Linear precoding; Massive MIMO; Normalization methods; Secrecy analysis",,,,,,,,"Rusek, F., Persson, D., Lau, B.K., Larsson, E.G., Marzetta, T.L., Edfors, O., Tufvesson, F., Scaling up MIMO: opportunities and challenges with very large arrays (2013) Signal Processing Magazine, IEEE, 30 (1), pp. 40-60; Ngo, H.Q., Larsson, E.G., Marzetta, T.L., Energy and spectral efficiency of very large multiuser MIMO systems (2013) Commun., IEEE Trans., 61 (4), pp. 1436-1449; Marzetta, T.L., “Noncooperative cellular wireless with unlimited numbers of base station antennas (2010) Wireless Commun.

Box 3011, Commerce, TX  75429, United States","Network application identification is one of the core elements in network operations and management to provide enhanced network service and security. For accurate identification, an approach using common patterns called “signatures” is widely used to compensate the limitations of the traditional transport-layer port-based classification. However, our simulation results indicate that using the signatures generated from a set of well known algorithms may lead to very poor identification performance, with less than 60% of true positives even in an optimal case. To improve the quality of signatures, we present a technique in this paper, which consists of two steps: (i) pairwise merging to consider every possible combination of the initially collected signatures to reduce their specificity that causes the signatures to be less common; and (ii) signature reduction to identify effective signatures with greater importance from a large set of signatures produced in the merging step, so as to manage the space/time complexity in the identification process for greater scalability. Our experimental results show that the proposed technique can dramatically improve the performance, even with a small number of signatures (e.g., 95% true positives rate with 30 signatures per application) which is more compact than the initial signature set. © 2018 Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications","Application signatures; Explicit string patterns; Network application identification; Pairwise merging; Signature reduction",,,,,,"10041548","This work was supported in part by the IT R&D program of MOTIE/KEIT [ 10041548 , “240Gbps real-time automatic signature generation system for application traffic classification supporting over 95% completeness and accuracy”]","http://www.bittorrent.org/beps/bep_0003.html, The BitTorrent Protocol Specification; Dusi, M., Crotti, M., Gringoli, F., Salgarelli, L., Tunnel hunter: detecting application-layer tunnels with statistical fingerprinting (2009) Comput.

The estimation of missing data is essential for maintaining an uninterrupted quality of service in the CR. However, the existing methods are not suitable for interpolating missing data in high frequency signals. The storage of spectrum occupancy information is crucial for learning the spectrum usage and prediction. The existing techniques for wideband spectrum sensing suffer from poor edge detection capabilities. This paper proposes an S-Transformation (ST) based approach to solve these problems. For missing samples, the proposed method improves the accuracy of estimation. The ST can also be used to store the spectrum occupancy information. The simulation results show that the proposed scheme outperforms others by improving the accuracy of edge detection. Further, the simple implementation of the ST in the frequency domain is an advantage for the real time application. © 2019 Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications","Cognitive radio; Missing data estimation; S-transformation; Spectrum occupancy; Wideband sensing",,,,,,,"The authors acknowledge the funding received from IIT Roorkee faculty initiation (Grant No. IITR/FIG/100675) for carrying out this research.","FCC, Spectrum policy task force report (2002) Federal Communications Commission (FCC’02), Washington, DC, USA, pp. 745-747; Mitola, J., Maguire, G.Q., Cognitive radio: making software radios more personal (1999) IEEE Pers.

To deal with this problem, a time-aware searchable encryption with designated server is proposed in this paper. It is based on Boneh's public key encryption with keyword search and Rivest's timed-release cryptology. Our construction has three features: the user cannot issue a keyword search query successfully unless the search falls into the specific time range; only the authorized user can generate a valid trapdoor; only the designated server can execute the search. Applying our scheme in a multi-user environment, the number of the keyword ciphertexts would not increase linearly with the number of the authorized users. The security and performance analysis shows that our proposed scheme is securer and more efficient than the existing similar schemes. © 2019 Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications","Designated server; EHRs; Privacy preserving; Searchable encryption; Timed-release",,,,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC: 61702067, 61472464","This work was jointly supperted by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 61702067 , No. 61472464 ), the Natural Science Foundation of Shangdong Province, China (No. ZR2015FL024 ).","DesRoches, C., Progress and challenges in electronic health record adoption: findings from a national survey of physicians (2015) Ann.

The main concept of QSM is to extend the spatial constellation of the conventional Spatial Modulation (SM) in both the in-phase and quadrature components of the data symbol. In this paper, because QSM-based on Interleaving Division Multiplexing (IDM) has not been introduced in the literature as a multiple antenna system, we introduced a novel scheme, called QSM system based on Interleaving Division Multiplexing (QSM-IDM). The antenna sets are also applied to a spreader, before being used to assign an antenna number for information transmission. Analysis and simulations for a flat fading channel show that the proposed QSM-IDM method significantly outperforms the original QSM system with the same data rate, while maintaining a relatively acceptable complexity. The obtained simulation results show that the conducted analysis yields significant improvements for the accuracy of the proposed scheme, with satisfactory complexity. © 2018 Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications","Interleaver Division Multiplexing (IDM); Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO); Quadrature Spatial Modulation (QSM); Spatial Modulation (SM)",,,,,,,,"Mietzner, J., Schober, R., Lampe, L., Gerstacker, W.H., H¨oher, P.A., Multiple–antenna techniques for wireless communications – a comprehensive literature survey (2009) IEEE Commun.

One way and two way relaying are considered. The signal is transmitted and received by two terminal nodes, each with a single antenna in two time phases. In the proposed design, the processing at the relay consists of Maximal-Ratio Combining (MRC) or Power-based Selection Combining (PSC) for receive combining, Amplify and Forward (AF) for power scaling, and Space Time Block Coding (STBC) for transmit diversity. Channel State Information (CSI), Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT), and Inverse Discrete Fourier Transform (IDFT) are not needed. The Selective Mapping (SLM) technique is used at the transmitter to reduce the Peak-to-Average Power Ratio (PAPR) of the OFDM signal. Then, at the receiver, the clipping technique is used to reduce the impulses that result from the impulsive noise. The proposed system reduces the complexity of the conventional system, which uses multi-relay with a single antenna. Simulation results show that the Bit Error Rate (BER) of the proposed scheme outperforms that of the conventional scheme due to the diversity inherent in the proposed scheme. © 2018 Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications","Impulsive noise; Multi-antenna relay; Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing; Peak-to-average power ratio reduction techniques; Reception combining; Transmit diversity",,,,,,,,"Laneman, J.N., Tse, D.N., Wornell, G.W., Cooperative diversity in wireless networks: efficient protocols and outage behavior (2004) IEEE Trans.

The state process we consider is Gaussian, independently and identically distributed, and known fully a-priori at the encoder. Each receiver has to perform a lossy estimation, to within some prescribed distortion tolerance under a squared error distortion criterion. The set-up also involves communicating messages across to the receivers, in addition to the estimation.

In order to resolve this problem, a beam interference model is introduced, and a lower complexity beam interference suppression algorithm based on user grouping is proposed. The proposed algorithm operates beam switching and multi-cell cooperative transmission for a part of the users when there exists beam interference due to high user density. In particular, considering the distinct interference suffered by each user, the proposed dual-threshold user grouping method can effectively solve the frequent switching problem at the base station caused by multi-cell cooperative transmission in multi-cell environments. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can reduce the computational complexity of beam switching and approach ideal system capacity, compared with conventional interference suppression algorithms that do not involve grouping of users. © 2019 Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications","Beam interference; Beam switching; Millimeter wave; Multi-cell cooperative transmission; User grouping",,,,,,"IRT16R72

CoAP is specifically intended to work well with low complexity sensors that have limited access to computational resources. And because it lacks the overhead of other more sophisticated transport protocols, it is suitable for high packet loss wireless networks. Relying on the User Datagram Protocol (UDP), CoAP introduces, among other things, confirmable and non-confirmable message types, depending on the nature of the source data. This paper presents a novel analytical model that can relate the application to network packet loss and be used to estimate the effect of lossy wireless channels in CoAP scenarios. Moreover, the model is ultimately validated by an experimental framework in which theoretical and experimental results are compared. © 2019 Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications","CoAP; IoT; UDP; Wireless; WSN",,,,,,,,"Thangavel, D., Ma, X., Valera, A., Tan, H.X., Tan, C.K.Y., Performance evaluation of mqtt and coap via a common middleware (2014) Intelligent Sensors, Sensor Networks and Information Processing (ISSNIP), 2014 IEEE Ninth International Conference on, pp. 1-6; Cirstea, C., Cernaianu, M., Gontean, A., Packet loss analysis in wireless sensor networks routing protocols (2012) Telecommunications and Signal Processing (TSP), 2012 35th International Conference on, pp. 37-41; Karagiannis, V., Chatzimisios, P., Vázquez-Gallego, F., Alonso-Zarate, J., A survey on application layer protocols for the internet of things (2015) Transaction on IoT and Cloud Computing (TICC), 1 (1); Slabicki, M., Grochla, K., Performance evaluation of coap, snmp and netconf protocols in fog computing architecture (2016) NOMS 2016-2016 IEEE/IFIP Network Operations and Management Symposium, pp. 1315-1319; Granjal, J., Monteiro, E., Silva, J.S., Security for the internet of things: a survey of existing protocols and open research issues (2015) IEEE Communications Surveys Tutorials, 17 (3), pp. 1294-1312; Asghar, M.H., Mohammadzadeh, N., Design and simulation of energy efficiency in node based on mqtt protocol in internet of things (2015) Green Computing and Internet of Things (ICGCIoT), 2015 International Conference on, pp. 1413-1417; Bendel, S., Springer, T., Schuster, D., Schill, A., Ackermann, R., Ameling, M., A service infrastructure for the internet of things based on xmpp (2013) Pervasive Computing and Communications Workshops (PERCOM Workshops), 2013 IEEE International Conference on, pp. 385-388; Vinoski, S., Advanced message queuing protocol (2006) IEEE Internet Computing, 10 (6), pp. 87-89; Bormann, C., Hartke, K., Shelby, Z., The constrained application protocol (CoAP) (2015) RFC, 7252. , https://rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7252.txt, URL; Peniak, P., Franekova, M., Model of integration of embedded systems via coap protocol of internet of things (2016) 2016 International Conference on Applied Electronics (AE), pp. 201-204; Thombre, S., Islam, R.U., Andersson, K., Hossain, M.S., Performance analysis of an ip based protocol stack for wsns (2016) 2016 IEEE Conference on Computer Communications Workshops (INFOCOM WKSHPS), pp. 360-365; Chen, Y., Kunz, T., Performance evaluation of iot protocols under a constrained wireless access network (2016) 2016 International Conference on Selected Topics in Mobile Wireless Networking (MoWNeT), pp. 1-7; Collina, M., Bartolucci, M., Vanelli-Coralli, A., Corazza, G.E., Internet of things application layer protocol analysis over error and delay prone links (2014) 2014 7th Advanced Satellite Multimedia Systems Conference and the 13th Signal Processing for Space Communications Workshop (ASMS/SPSC), pp. 398-404; Betzler, A., Gomez, C., Demirkol, I., Paradells, J., Coap congestion control for the internet of things (2016) IEEE Commun.

A few high profile companies, such as Google, Space Data Inc., etc., have already made news by initiating projects based on high-altitude WBNs in order to provide internet facilities in remote areas. Unfortunately, the technical details have mainly been kept confidential so far. In this paper, we attempt to analyze the percolation properties of large-scale WBNs, considering both homogenous and heterogenous wireless nodes. In order to do so, we modeled a WBN as a large-scale random network where the path-loss models of homogenous and heterogenous WBNs were reduced to GDM (Gilbert's Disk Model) and RGDM (Random Gilbert's Disk Model), respectively. The bounds of the critical density regime were derived for both percolation models. Additionally, this paper implemented an experimental test bed for the WBN percolation model.

By using a Basis Expansion Model (BEM), the channel impulse response is modeled as the sum of several basis functions multiplied by coefficients. By estimating the basis function coefficients, the fast time-varying channel can be approximated. In order to reduce the estimation error resulting from the high frequency basis function, the Generalized Complex Exponential BEM (GCE-BEM)is modified to form an Improved GCE-BEM (IGCE-BEM)by adding a correction coefficient to the basis function. Moreover, an Improved Baseline Tilting (IBT)method is proposed to reduce the Gibbs effect. In addition, linear interpolation, Gauss interpolation, and three-order Hermite interpolation are adopted to obtain the channel impulse response at non pilot locations based on the channel estimation results at pilot positions. The simulation results show that the IGCE-BEM outperforms the CE-BEM and GCE-BEM in terms of the Normalized Mean Squared Error (NMSE). The IBT method is better than the BT method in reducing the Gibbs effect. In addition, combined with the IBT, the IGCE-BEM also has low NMSE under high moving speed and high noise power. The performance of the three-order Hermite interpolation method is higher than that of the linear interpolation and Gauss interpolation approaches. © 2018 Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications","Basis expansion model; Channel estimation; Interpolation algorithm; LTE-R",,,,,,"Natural Science Foundation of Fujian Province: 2015J05122

Name resolution and routing is critical for content retrieval in ICN networks. In this research, we perform a comparative study of two widely used classes of ICN name resolution and routing schemes, namely flooding and Distributed Hash Table (DHT). We consider the flooding-based routing in Content-Centric Networks due to its wide acceptance. For the DHT scheme, we design a multi-level DHT that takes into account the underlying network topology and uses name aggregation to further reduce control overhead and improve network efficiency. Then, we compare the characteristics and performance of these two classes of name resolution and routing through extensive simulations. The evaluation results show that the performances of these two approaches are reliant on several factors, including network size, content location dynamics, and content popularity.

However, efficient alternatives, including 5G methods, are being explored to mitigate this problem. Such systems also aspire to render sustained coverage with lesser constraints on power and Quality of Service (QoS). Today, versatile Digital Phase Locked Loop (DPLL)based packages find place as communication receivers. Of late, a Least Square Polynomial Fitting DPLL (LSPF-DPLL)with Modified Phase Resolving Numerically Controlled Oscillator (MPR-NCO), which demonstrates excellent time performance and maintains satisfactory error rates, was proposed. A Bose, Chaudhuri, and Hocquenghem (BCH)channel code assisted version of the MPR-NCO based LSPF-DPLL system is presented here. The proposed system exhibits better Bit Error Rate (BER), throughput, and baud rate levels over the previously proposed uncoded version. © 2019 Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications","Coding; Fading; Frequency tracking; Least squares; Phase recovery",,,,,,,,"Peng, M., Yan, S., Zhang, K., Wang, C., Fog computing based radio access networks: issues and challenges (2016) IEEE Netw., 30 (4), pp. 46-53; Peng, M., Li, Y., Zhao, Z., Wang, C., System architecture and key technologies for 5G heterogenous cloud radio access networks (2015) IEEE Netw., 29 (2), pp. 6-14; Bhattacharyya, S., Misra, A., Sarma, K.K., A modified NCO based LSPF-DPLL phase resolver for wireless communication (2016) Proc. 3rd IEEE Int.

We consider the Channel Impulse Response (CIR) coefficients with a critical Doppler frequency shift and multi-path fading that were taken from the WINNER II channel model and the D2a propagation scenario, where the conditions of HSR are analyzed. As multi-path fading increases and the channel varies in the order of the symbol period, we first propose a novel approach for designing a pilot symbol structure in the time domain. Then, we describe the deployment of the proposed pilot symbol structure to estimate the channel in the time domain. Channel information corresponding to the data positions is obtained by linear interpolation. In each OFDM symbol, the slope and the initial value for establishing an interpolation function are estimated to adapt to the time variation of the channel. An accurate estimate of channel state information is used for the purpose of ICI cancellation. The simulation results show that the channel estimated by our proposed method can follow the real channel well, even in a very high Doppler frequency. The estimation method in terms of Mean Squared Error (MSE) significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. The combination of our channel estimator with several interference cancelers provides a considerably better system performance than that achieved when frequency channel estimation is used. © 2019 Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications","Channel estimation; ICI cancellation; LTE-R; OFDM",,,,,,"Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport, MOLIT

For meeting future capacity requirements in aeronautical communications, we propose two new approaches one of which is a cognitive radio based A/G communication network that provides dynamic spectrum access to airplanes to overcome the spectrum scarcity problem in the VHF band. Another approach involves use of a new spectrum in the Ultra-High Frequency band (UHF) to create a new A/G link. In this paper, we propose and investigate the possibilities for developing a spectrum sensing approach to detect idle band in the VHF spectrum and analyze the possible interference between future L-band Digital Aeronautical Communication System (L-DACS) and legacy aeronautical systems. © 2019 Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications","Cognitive radio; DME; LDACS",,,,,,,,"EUROCONTROL, EUROCONTROL's Challenges of Growth 2008 Study Report (2008); (2007) Future Communications Infrastructure—Technology Investigations: Description of AMACS, , EUROCONTROL Brussels, Belgium Version 1.0; Schnell, M., Brandes, S., Gligorevic, S., Rokitansky, C.H., Ehammer, M., Gräupl, T., B-AMC- broadband aeronautical multi-carrier communications (2008) Proceedings of the Integrated Communications Navigation and Surveillance Conference, Bethesda,MD; (2013), http://www.sesarju.eu, SESAR Joint Undertakings (JU) News, Last access Aug. 23; (2013), http://www.faa.gov/nextgen, U.

Better coordination between the base station and relays to mitigate inter-cell interference becomes an important aspect of achieving the required system performance, not only in the single-cell scenario, but also in multi-cell scenarios. In this paper, we model and analyze two basic approaches for designing a 4G LTE-A tri-sectored cellular system. The approaches are based on Antenna Selection Sectored Relaying (ASSR)and Beam Selection Sectored Relaying (BSSR). The main purpose of the proposed schemes is to enhance system performance by improving the quality of the wireless relay backhaul link. In this technique, antenna selection takes into consideration Non-Line-Of-Sight (NLOS)communication, whereas BSSR considers the case of Line-Of-Sight (LOS)communication using heuristic beam forming approach. The resource allocation problem has also been investigated for relay based cooperative LTE-A tri-sectored cell in the downlink. The best possible location for relay node in the sector, power allocation and MIMO channel modeling is formulated as an optimization problem with the aim of maximizing the end to end link rate and the Signal to Interference plus Noise Ratio (SINR)of 4G LTE-A systems. Power allocation/optimization has been solved by means of the duality equation of the stationary Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT)condition and is used to derive optimal values for the beam forming vector on both the relay as well as the access link. The performance of the proposed scheme is verified through simulations carried out using MATLAB software. The simulation results show a significant improvement in the SINR, throughput capacity, and coverage area of the 4G LTE-A cell, while guaranteeing better quality of service. © 2019 Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications","Antenna Selection Sectored Relaying (ASSR); Beam Selection Sectored Relaying (BSSR); Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT); Long Term Evolution-Advanced (LTE-A); Relay Node (RN); Sectored Relaying (SR)",,,,,,,,"(2009) 3GPP, TR-36.913 v8.0.1, Requirements for Further Advancements for E-UTRA, pp. 1-17; Parkvall, S., Furuska, A., Dahlman, E., Evolution of LTE toward IMT-A (2011) IEEE Commun.

Most existing research has utilized Zigbee or WiFi as the communication technology. Both technologies use ultra-high frequencies (primarily 2.4 GHz) and suffer from a relatively short transmission range (i.e., 100 m line-of-sight). The objective of this study is to assess the feasibility and potential of transmitting image information using RF modules with lower frequencies (e.g., 433 MHz) to achieve a larger-scale deployment as in a city scenario. The Arduino platform is used because of its low cost and simplicity. Details of hardware properties are provided in this article, and we investigate optimum configurations for the system. After achieving an initial range test transmission distance of more than 2000 m line-of-sight, the prototype network is installed in a real life city plot for further examination of performance.

University of Electronic Science and Technology of China","Recent breakthroughs in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML), including deep neural networks, the availability of huge amount of data, and powerful computing platforms are providing us with technologies to perform tasks that once seemed impossible. The recent win of AlphaGo over the world champion Mr. Lee Sedol has witnessed the power of AI beyond what many of us can imagine. In the near future, autonomous vehicles, intelligent mobile networks, and intelligent internet-of-things will become a norm and AI will be one of the key technologies to make all these possible. Therefore, we forsee that AI can provide many new and unprecedented opportunities in the way we design our wireless and wired data pipelines, the way we manage and optimize our wireless and wired networks, and the way we manage and deliver different user services and user content. The purpose of this special issue is to explore and understand how advanced innovations in ML can enable the application of AI in future wireless communications and networking. We received a considerable number of submissions from different countries. After a rigorous review process, we assembled eight papers based on relevance and fit. It covers a wide range of topics including fog computing, mobile edge computing, caching, internet-of-things, aerial communications, MIMO systems, signal detection, and energy-aware and delay-aware optimization. These papers provide a diverse perspective on the potential application of AI in future wireless communications and networking. The first paper entitled “Enabling intelligence in fog computing to achieve energy and latency reduction” shows how device and human-driven intelligence can be a key enabler to achieve better energy consumption and latency in fog computing in two scenarios. The first scenario employs ML to design content-aware medium access control mechanism in fog computing. The second scenario considers an intelligent task offloading algorithm design in fog computing. The second paper entitled “Deep reinforcement learning-based joint task offloading and bandwidth allocation for multi-user mobile edge computing” proposes a deep-Q network based task offloading and bandwidth allocation for mobile edge computing. The objective of minimization problem is the overall offloading cost, which includes the energy cost, computation cost, and delay cost. The third paper entitled “Caching resource management of mobile edge network based on Stackelberg game” considers a network composed of one operator, multiple users, and content providers. To solve the best caching resource allocation scheme, the original problem is transformed into a multi-leader multi-follower Stackelberg game model. The paper by Wang et al. studies the joint content caching and updating strategy in Internet-of-Thing (IoT) networks by taking both the sensors' energy consumption and contents' freshness loss into account. This content caching and updating problem is formulated as a mixed integer non-convex optimization program and a harmony search based algorithm is proposed. The fifth paper entitled “Antenna selection for MIMO system based on pattern recognition” proposes pattern recognition methods to carry out the transmit antenna selection algorithm in MIMO system. In particular, the K-nearest neighbour algorithm and the support vector machine algorithm have been modified to perform low-complexity but high-efficient transmit antenna selection. The paper by Islam et al. develops a novel strategy for further improving the energy efficiency of an aerial base station by considering ternary state transceivers. Furthermore, a Markovian Decision process based algorithm, which intelligently switches between the states of the transceivers based on the traffic whilst maintaining a prescribed minimum channel rate per user, has been proposed. The paper by Wu et al. considers the detection problem of weak harmonic signal under strong chaotic interference using an extended Kalman filter detection method. This method avoids matrix inversion by iterating from measurement equation and state equation, which makes it robust as well as computationally efficient. In the final paper entitled “Traffic-driven epidemic spreading and its control strategies” provides an overview of traffic-driven epidemic spreading in complex networks. Furthermore, the control of traffic-driven epidemic spreading is discussed by focusing on network structure optimization and immunization strategies. In summary, we received many papers in response to the call for papers of this special issue. We would like to express our appreciation to all the authors who submitted their research works to our issue. We would also like to thank all the reviewers who provided critical reviews of the diverse set of papers that we received.

However, the transient nature of the data generated in IoT networks brings great challenges for content caching. In this paper, we study a joint content caching and updating strategy in IoT networks, taking both the energy consumption of the sensors and the freshness loss of the contents into account. In particular, we decide whether or not to cache the transient data and, if so, how often the servers should update their contents. We formulate this content caching and updating problem as a mixed 0–1 integer non-convex optimization programming, and devise a Harmony Search based content Caching and Updating (HSCU) algorithm, which is self-learning and derivative-free and hence stipulates no requirement on the relationship between the objective and variables. Finally, extensive simulation results verify the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm in terms of the achieved satisfaction ratio for content delivery, normalized energy consumption, and overall network utility, by comparing it with some baseline algorithms. © 2018 Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications","Content caching and updating; Data freshness; IoT",,,,,,"Z111021801

In this paper, an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) based detection method is proposed for the detection of weak harmonic signal. The EKF method avoids matrix inversion by iterating measurement equation and state equation, which simultaneously improves the robustness and reduces the complexity. Compared with the existing detection methods, the proposed method has the following advantages: 1) it has better performance than the neural network method; 2) it has similar performance with the optimal filtering method, but with lower computational complexity; 3) it is more robust compared with the optimal filtering method. © 2018 Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications","Extended Kalman filter; Strong chaotic interference; Weak harmonic signal",,,,,,"Sichuan Province Science and Technology Support Program

As the conventional TAS algorithms need to search all possible legitimate antenna subsets, they may impose some redundant calculations. In order to avoid this problem, we employ some pattern recognition methods to carry out the TAS algorithm in this paper. To be specific, two PR algorithms, namely the K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) algorithm and the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm, are introduced and redesigned to obtain a TAS with lower complexity but higher efficiency. Moreover, in order to improve the performance of the SVM, we propose a new feature extraction of channel matrix for the TAS. Our simulation results show that the proposed KNN and SVM based PR-TAS algorithms are capable of striking a flexible tradeoff between the complexity and the Bit Error Rate (BER), and the new feature can effectively improve the BER performance compared with the conventional feature extraction method. © 2018 Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications","Antenna selection; K-nearest neighbors; Multiple-input multiple-output; Pattern recognition; Support vector machine",,,,,,"National Major Science and Technology Projects of China: 2018ZX03001001

This paper aims to improve the utility of mobile edge caching technology from the perspectie of caching resource management by examining a network composed of one operator, multiple users and Content Providers (CPs). The caching resource management model is constructed on the premise of fully considering the QoE of users and the servicing capability of the Base Station (BS). In order to create the best caching resource allocation scheme, the original problem is transformed into a multi-leader multi-follower Stackelberg game model through the analysis of the system model. The strategy combinations and the utility functions of players are analyzed. The existence and uniqueness of the Nash Equilibrium (NE) solution are also analyzed and proved. The optimal strategy combinations and the best responses are deduced in detail. Simulation results and analysis show that the proposed model and algorithm can achieve the optimal allocation of caching resource and improve the QoE of users. © 2018 Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications","Caching resource management; Mobile edge caching; Quality of Experience; Stackelberg game",,,,,,"20151BAB217018, 20151BAB217001

There are many advantages of using aerial platforms to provide wireless coverage, including larger coverage in remote areas and better line-of-sight conditions, etc. Energy is a scarce resource for the AeBSs, hence the wise management of energy is quite beneficial for the aerial network. In this context, we study the means of reducing the total energy consumption by designing and implementing an energy efficient AeBSs as presented in this paper. Implementing the sleep mode in the Base Stations (BSs) has been proven to be a very good approach for improving the energy efficiency and we propose a novel strategy for further improving energy efficiency by considering ternary state transceivers for AeBSs. Using the three state model, we propose a Markov Decision Process (MDP) based algorithm, which intelligently switches among three states of the transceivers based on the offered traffic meanwhile maintaining a prescribed minimum channel rate per user. We define a reward function for the MDP, which helps us to get an optimal policy for selecting a particular mode for the transceivers of the AeBS. Considering an AeBS with transceivers whose states are changeable, we perform simulations to analyse the performance of the algorithm. Our results show that, compared with the always active model, around 40% gain in the energy efficiency is achieved by using our proposed MDP algorithm together with the three-state transceivers model. We also show the energy-delay tradeoff in order to design an efficient AeBS. © 2018 Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications","Aerial base station; Energy delay tradeoff; Energy efficiency; Green communication; Markov decision process; Sleep mode; UAV",,,,,,"Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation, CSIRO

Then, we analyze the key factors which have significant impact on the epidemic threshold, such as the traffic congestion and routing protocols. Furthermore, we discuss the control of the TDES by focusing on the network structure optimization and the immunization strategies.

Mobile Edge Computing (MEC), which enables mobile terminals to offload computation tasks to servers located at the edge of the cellular networks, has been considered as an efficient approach to relieve the heavy computational burdens and realize an efficient computation offloading. Driven by the consequent requirement for proper resource allocations for computation offloading via MEC, in this paper, we propose a Deep-Q Network (DQN) based task offloading and resource allocation algorithm for the MEC. Specifically, we consider a MEC system in which every mobile terminal has multiple tasks offloaded to the edge server and design a joint task offloading decision and bandwidth allocation optimization to minimize the overall offloading cost in terms of energy cost, computation cost, and delay cost. Although the proposed optimization problem is a mixed integer nonlinear programming in nature, we exploit an emerging DQN technique to solve it. Extensive numerical results show that our proposed DQN-based approach can achieve the near-optimal performance. © 2018 Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications","Deep-Q network; Joint computation offloading and resource allocation; Mobile edge computing",,,,,,"LR16F010003

In order to address the issues of energy efficiency and latency requirements for the time-critical Internet-of-Things (IoT) applications, fog computing systems could apply intelligence features in their operations to take advantage of the readily available data and computing resources. In this paper, we propose an approach that involves device-driven and human-driven intelligence as key enablers to reduce energy consumption and latency in fog computing via two case studies. The first one makes use of the machine learning to detect user behaviors and perform adaptive low-latency Medium Access Control (MAC)-layer scheduling among sensor devices. In the second case study on task offloading, we design an algorithm for an intelligent EU device to select its offloading decision in the presence of multiple fog nodes nearby, at the same time, minimize its own energy and latency objectives. Our results show a huge but untapped potential of intelligence in tackling the challenges of fog computing. © 2018 Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications","Computational offloading; Edge computing; Energy efficiency; Fog computing; MAC scheduling; Machine learning",,,,,,,,"Bonomi, F., Milito, R., Zhu, J., Addepalli, S., Fog computing and its role in the Internet of things (2012) Proc.

Such auto-scaling mechanism can largely enhance the elasticity and the scalability of cloud platforms. However, it may introduce new security threats. For example, Yo-Yo attack is a newly disclosed attack against the cloud auto-scaling mechanism. Attackers periodically send bursts of traffic to cause the auto-scaling mechanism to oscillate between the scale-up process and the scale-down process, which may result in significant performance degradation and economic loss. None of prior work addressed the problem of mitigating such attack. In this paper, we propose a Trust-based Adversarial Scanner Delaying (TASD) approach to effectively and proactively mitigate the Yo-Yo attack on the cloud auto-scaling mechanism. In TASD, we first propose to use the trust-based scheme to establish trust values for users, which is leveraged to identify adversarial requests. Trust values are updated by jointly considering the request mode and the auto-scaling status. Then, we aim to disable the condition under which the Yo-Yo attack takes effect by injecting certain delay, under the QoS constraints, to manipulate the response time of suspicious requests and deceive the attackers. Our extensive evaluation demonstrates that our approach achieves promising results, e.g., it can detect at least 80% Yo-Yo adversarial users and reduce more than 41% malicious scale-ups. © 2019 Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications","Attack defense; Attack detection; Auto-scaling mechanism; cloud computing; Yo-yo attack",,,,,,"Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, BUPT: SKLNST-2016-2-24

Software-Defined Network (SDN) is an emerging architecture aimed to address this need. However, maintaining accurate knowledge of the network after a failure is one of the largest challenges in the SDN. Motivated by this reality, this paper focuses on the use of self-healing properties to boost the SDN robustness. This approach, unlike traditional schemes, is not based on proactively configuring multiple (and memory-intensive) backup paths in each switch or performing a reactive and time-consuming routing computation at the controller level. Instead, the control paths are quickly recovered by local switch actions and subsequently optimized by global controller knowledge. Obtained results show that the proposed approach recovers the control topology effectively in terms of time and message load over a wide range of generated networks. Consequently, scalability issues of traditional fault recovery strategies are avoided. © 2019 Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications","Autonomic network management; Fault tolerance; Network management; Protocol design; Software-defined network",,,,,,"Agencia Estatal de InvestigaciÃ³n, AEI

The future integrated 5G-WLAN wireless networks will support seamless and secure roaming, and various types of real-time applications and services, which will be the trend of next-generation computing paradigm. In this paper, we discuss the privacy and security problems in 5G-WLAN heterogeneous networks and present a logical 5G-WLAN integrated architecture. We also propose a novel USIM and ECC based design of handover authentication for next-generation 5G-WLAN heterogeneous networks that can provide secure and seamless Internet connectivity. Our scheme accomplishes the features of strong security and has better performance in terms of computation cost, energy cost, and storage cost as compared with the state-of-the-art schemes. © 2019 Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications","5G; ECC; Handover; Heterogeneous; WLAN",,,,,,,,"Dahlman, E., Parkvall, S., Skold, J., 4G: LTE/LTE-advanced for Mobile Broadband (2013), Academic Press; Fan, C.-I., Lin, Y.-H., Hsu, R.-H., Complete eap method: user efficient and forward secure authentication protocol for ieee 802.11 wireless lans (2013) IEEE Trans.

The need to identify those devices is foremost important to perform any kind of operation. Many organizations and standard bodies that provide specifications and frameworks for the IoT currently have their own identification mechanisms. Some existing industrial identification mechanisms can also be used in the IoT. There is no common Identification Scheme (IS) for the IoT as yet, because of the political and commercial differences amongst the standard bodies. The unavailability of a unified IS and method makes the inter-working among IoT platforms challenging. This paper analyses and compares ISs used by several selected IoT platforms. This work will help in understanding the need of a common identification mechanism to provide inter-working among different IoT platforms. © 2019 Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications","Identification schemes; Identifiers; Internet of things; IoT platforms; IoT standards",,,,,,"Institute for Information and Communications Technology Promotion, IITP

In this method, clients are able to test whether an item is in a set controlled by the server without revealing their query item to the server. After executing the queries, the content of the server's set remains secret. One use case for a private membership test is to check whether a file contains any malware by checking its signature against a database of malware samples in a privacy preserving way. We apply the Bloom filter and the Cuckoo filter in the membership test procedure. In order to achieve privacy properties, we present a novel protocol based on some homomorphic encryption schemes. In our protocol, we rearrange the data in the set into N-dimensional hypercubes. We have implemented our method in a realistic scenario where a client of an anti-malware company wants to privately check whether a hash value of a given file is in the malware database of the company. The evaluation shows that our method is feasible for real-world applications. We also have tested the performance of our protocol for databases of different sizes and data structures with different dimensions: 2-dimensional, 3-dimensional and 4-dimensional hypercubes. We present formulas to estimate the cost of computation and communication in our protocol. © 2019 Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications","Applied cryptography; Homomorphic encryption; Privacy enhancing technologies; Private information retrieval; Private membership test",,,,,,"Academy of Finland: 283135

Traditionally, these services were classified according to the average number of bytes transmitted or their delivery time. However, when dealing with battery-operated devices, another important parameter to be taken into account is their power consumption. Furthermore, software designers and developers often do not consider the efficiency of a data communication system, but are simply concerned about ease-of-use and response time. In this paper, we compare FCM, GCM and two types of WS, namely Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) and REpresentational State Transfer (REST) WS in terms of delay, data efficiency, and power consumption. The final outcome is that RESTful WS outperforms all others, making GCM and FCM a viable alternative only when the amount of data to be transmitted is very limited, or when the mobile application requires the advanced services offered by FCM or GCM only. © 2019 Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications","Firebase Cloud Messaging; Google Cloud Messaging; REST; SOAP; Web Services",,,,,,,,"Alonso, G., Casati, F., Kuno, H., Machiraju, V., Web Services: Concepts, Architectures and Applications (2004), pp. 123-125. , Springer Ch.

However, security challenges have become the biggest obstacles for the advancement of this emerging technology. A well-established policy framework is defined in this paper to generate security policies which are compliant to requirements and capabilities. Moreover, a federated policy management schema is introduced based on the policy definition framework and a multi-level policy application to create and manage virtual clusters with identical or common security levels. The proposed model consists in the design of a well-established ontology according to security mechanisms, a procedure which classifies nodes with common policies into virtual clusters, a policy engine to enhance the process of mapping requests to a specific node as well as an associated cluster and matchmaker engine to eliminate inessential mapping processes. The suggested model has been evaluated according to performance and security parameters to prove the efficiency and reliability of this multi-layered engine in cloud computing environments during policy definition, application and mapping procedures. © 2019 Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications","Access control; Cloud computing; Policy management; Policy mapping; Security; Security management",,,,,,"European Commission, EC

It requires privacy preserving data aggregation protocols to secure the data from compromisers. Preserving privacy of the sensor data is a challenging task. This paper presents a non-linear regression-based data aggregation protocol for preserving privacy of the sensor data. The proposed protocol uses non-linear regression functions to represent the sensor data collected from the sensor nodes. Instead of sending the complete data to the cluster head, the sensor nodes only send the coefficients of the non-linear function. This will reduce the communication overhead of the network. The data aggregation is performed on the masked coefficients and the sink node is able to retrieve the approximated results over the aggregated data. The analysis of experiment results shows that the proposed protocol is able to minimize communication overhead, enhance data aggregation accuracy, and preserve data privacy. © 2019 Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications","Data accuracy; Data aggregation; Privacy preserving; Sensor nodes; Wireless sensor networks",,,,,,,,"Cheng, S., Cai, Z., Li, J., Fang, X., Drawing dominant dataset from big sensory data in wireless sensor networks (2015) Proceedings of the 2015 IEEE Conference on Computer Communications, p. 531539. , INFOCOM Hong Kong, China 26 April; He, Z., Cai, Z., Cheng, S., Wang, X., Approximate aggregation for tracking quantiles and range countings in wireless sensor networks (2015) Theor.

Not only being able to get the sensor data, such as voltage, current, and temperature, the system can also have a proper control for tracking the Sun and sensing real-time data from a controller. In order to absorb the maximum energy by solar cells, it needs to track the Sun with proper angles. Arduino, H-bridge motor driver circuit, and Direct Current (DC) motor are used to alter the tilt angle of the solar Photovoltaic (PV) panel following the Sun while the azimuth and the elevation angles are fixed at noon. Unlike the traditional way, the tilt rotation is proposed to be stepped hourly. The solar PV panel is tilted 7.5 ∘ in advance of current time to the west to produce more output voltage during an hour. As a result, the system is simple while providing good solar-tracking results and efficient power outputs. © 2018 Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications","Monitoring; Photovoltaic; Wireless communication; Wireless sensor network; Xbee; Zigbee",,,,,,"Asian Institute of Technology, AIT","I would like to thank my supervisor, Dr. Attaphongse Taparugssanagorn, for his guidance, constant encouragement, dedication and support to complete my work.

A novel approach (Approach-1) for improved selection is proposed, which relies on the probabilities of channels by which they are predicted idle. Further, closed-form expressions are derived for the throughput of Cognitive Users (CUs) in the conventional and proposed approaches. In addition to this, a fundamental approach for computing the prediction probabilities is also proposed. Moreover, a new challenging issue named “sense and stuck” was observed in the conventional approach. The proposed approach is validated by comparing the results achieved with the results of the conventional approach. However, to achieve the prediction probabilities, the pre-channel-state-information is a prerequisite, but it may be unavailable for particular scenarios; therefore, a modified selection method is introduced to avoid the sense and stuck problem. An algorithm to evaluate the throughput using the random, improved, and modified selection methods is presented with its space and time complexities. Furthermore, for additional improvement in the throughput of the CU, a new frame structure is introduced, in which the spectrum prediction and sensing periods are exploited for simultaneous transmission of data via the underlay spectrum access technique (Approach-2). The simulated results of Approach-2 are compared with our pre-obtained results of Approach-1, which confirm significant improvement in the throughput. © 2017 Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications","Cognitive radio; Interweave; Prediction; Spectrum accessing; Throughput; Underlay",,,,,,,"The authors are sincerely thankful to the potential reviewers for their constructive comments and suggestions to improve the quality of the manuscript.

However, the labeling of data is costly and becomes infeasible when dealing with big data, such as those generated by Internet of Things applications. To this effect, building an ML model that learns from non-labeled or partially labeled data is of critical importance. This paper proposes a Semi-supervised Multi-Layered Clustering ((SMLC)) model for the detection and prevention of network intrusion. SMLC has the capability to learn from partially labeled data while achieving a detection performance comparable to that of supervised ML-based IDPS. The performance of SMLC is compared with that of a well-known semi-supervised model (tri-training) and of supervised ensemble ML models, namely RandomForest, Bagging, and AdaboostM1 on two benchmark network-intrusion datasets, NSL and Kyoto 2006+. Experimental results show that SMLC is superior to tri-training, providing a comparable detection accuracy with 20% less labeled instances of training data. Furthermore, our results demonstrate that our scheme has a detection accuracy comparable to that of the supervised ensemble models. © 2018 Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications","Big data; Classification; Ensembles; Machine learning; Semi-supervised intrusion detection",,,,,,,"This publication was made possible with the support of the ICT Fund (Grant #: G00000103 ).

This article also describes SPP Microstrip (MS) structures at microwave and terahertz frequencies, and compares their significance with that of conventional MS Transmission Lines (TL), in order to tackle the key challenges of high gain, bandwidth size, compactness, TL losses, and signal integrity in high-end electronic devices. Because they have subwavelength properties, surface plasmon polaritons are gaining attention for their improved performance and ability for miniaturization in high-speed dense circuits. They possess comparably minuscule wavelength compared to incident light (photons). Consequently, they can demonstrate stronger spatial confinement and higher local field intensity at optical frequencies. In addition to engineering spoof SPP waveguides, which are created by engraving grooves and slits on metal surfaces to allow operation on at low frequencies (microwave and terahertz), semiconductors with smaller permittivity values and thus lower free charge carrier concentration have been demonstrated as a potential candidate in plasmonic devices. If necessary, further tuning of semiconductor-based SPP structures is aided by controlling the charge carrier concentration through doping, or by external stimuli such as optical illumination or thermal excitation of charge carriers from valence to conduction bands.

With several great features, OFDM is severely affected by undesirable effects of frequency offset errors and Local Oscillator (LO) frequency synchronization errors. This paper proposes an approach that devises a new hybrid technique, which is a combination of Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) and Self Cancellation (SC) techniques through wavelet implication, to enhance BER performance of the OFDM system. A comparative analysis of SC, MLE, and wavelet-based hybrid InterCarrier Interference (ICI) cancellation techniques was conducted using 64-QAM and differential offset (0.02 and 0.01) for differential data bits (4 Mb and 16 Mb) to justify the outstanding results. The simulation results showed a significant byte-error-rate improvement over different legacy techniques based on fast Fourier transform. © 2018 Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications","DWT; FFT; ICI; ISI; MLE; OFDM; SC; WOFDM",,,,,,,,"Hwang, T., Yang, C., Wu, G., Li, S., Li, G.Y., OFDM and its wireless applications: a Survey (2009) IEEE Trans.

However, with the increasing use of remote DNS, DNS-based CDNs face a great challenge in performance degradation. To address this issue, encouraging progress has been made in both industry and research communities. In this article, state-of-art solutions for the remote DNS problem are discussed at first. Next, privacy concerns about DNS-based CDNs, including client location as well as redirection privacy, are identified and a representative solution is summarized. Finally, the solution is compared to those in prior works under different measures, and a discussion on DNS-based CDN applications is provided. A model is also established to deepen the understanding of CDN performance. We believe that this survey will shed light on the application of DNS-based CDNs, and it is expected to provide design guidelines to CDN service providers. © 2017 Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications","Content delivery network; DNS privacy; DNS-Based server redirecting; Remote DNS",,,,,,,,"Yin, H., Liu, X., Qiu, F., Xia, N., Lin, C., Zhang, H., Sekar, V., Min, G., Inside the bird's nest: measurements of large-scale live VoD from the 2008 olympics (2009) Proc. of the 9th ACM SIGCOMM Conference on Internet Measurement Conference (IMC '09), pp. 442-455; Wendell, P., Freedman, M.J., Going viral: flash crowds in an open CDN (2011) Proc. of the 2011 ACM SIGCOMM Conference on Internet Measurement Conference (IMC '11), pp. 549-558; Vakali, A., Pallis, G., Content delivery networks: status and trends (2003) IEEE Internet Comput., 7 (6), pp. 68-74; Dilley, J., Maggs, B., Parikh, J., Prokop, H., Sitaraman, R., Weihi, B., Globally distributed content delivery (2002) IEEE Internet Comput., 6 (5), pp. 50-58; Nygren, E., Sitaraman, R.K., Sun, J., The akamai network: a platform for high-performance internet applications (2010) ACM SIGOPS Oper.

A sustainable communication system is required to be integrated as a multipurpose system capable of transferring all types of information such as data, voice and video on identical infrastructure. With its large bandwidth, the Ultra Wide Band (UWB) provides a promising solution to satisfy these requirements. The Multi-Band Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (MBOFDM) UWB system provides high resilience to Inter-Symbol Interference (ISI) caused by multipath fading channels. This study compares the performance of various existing multi-band UWB systems in the IEEE UWB channel and underground mine channel: MBOFDM, Multi-Band Orthogonal Frequency Code Division Multiplexing (MBOFCDM) and Multi-Band Orthogonal Wavelet Division Multiplexing (MBOWDM). Further, the application of 2D spreading to the MBOWDM UWB system is attempted, and as a result, the Multi-Band Orthogonal Wavelet Code Division Multiplexing (MBOWCDM) UWB system is proposed. The performance of the MBOWCDM system in the IEEE UWB channel and underground mine channel is investigated. The performance of the MBOWCDM UWB system is observed to be superior to those of other multi-band UWB systems. Moreover, the MBOWCDM UWB system supports a higher data rate with low complexity and lower overheads. © 2018 Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications","2D spreading; MBOFCDM; MBOFDM; MBOWCDM; MBOWDM; Underground mine channel",,,,,,,,"Chehri, A., Fortier, P., Tardif, P.M., CTHp1-8: Measurements and Modeling of Line-of-sight UWB Channel in Underground Mines (2006), pp. 1-5. , IEEE Globecom 2006 San Francisco, CA; Boutin, M., Benzakour, A., Despins, C.L., Affes, S., Radio wave characterization and modeling in underground mine tunnels (2008) IEEE Trans.

By 2020, it is estimated that the total number of Internet-connected devices being used will be between 25 and 50 billion. As these numbers grow and technologies become more mature, the volume of data being published will increase. The technology of Internet-connected devices, referred to as Internet of Things (IoT), continues to extend the current Internet by providing connectivity and interactions between the physical and cyber worlds. In addition to an increased volume, the IoT generates big data characterized by its velocity in terms of time and location dependency, with a variety of multiple modalities and varying data quality. Intelligent processing and analysis of this big data are the key to developing smart IoT applications. This article assesses the various machine learning methods that deal with the challenges presented by IoT data by considering smart cities as the main use case. The key contribution of this study is the presentation of a taxonomy of machine learning algorithms explaining how different techniques are applied to the data in order to extract higher level information. The potential and challenges of machine learning for IoT data analytics will also be discussed.

We make a number of observations, including the lack of publicly available IoT datasets that can be used by the research and practitioner communities. Given the potentially sensitive nature of IoT datasets, there is a need to develop a standard for sharing IoT datasets among the research and practitioner communities and other relevant stakeholders. Thus, we posit the potential for blockchain technology in facilitating secure sharing of IoT datasets (e.g., using blockchain to ensure the integrity of shared datasets) and securing IoT systems, before presenting two conceptual blockchain-based approaches. We then conclude this paper with nine potential research questions. © 2018 Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications","Blockchain; Blockchain security; Collaborative security; Internet-of-military things; Intrusion-prevention system; IoT dataset; IoT security; IoT self-healing; Predictive IoT security; Predictive security",,,,,,,,"Mirza, Q.K.A., Mohi-Ud-Din, G., Awan, I., A cloud-based energy efficient system for enhancing the detection and prevention of modern malware (2016) 2016 IEEE 30th International Conference on Advanced Information Networking and Applications (AINA), pp. 754-761. , Crans-Montana; Cadet, F., Fokum, D.T., Coping with denial-of-service attacks on the IP telephony system (2016) SoutheastCon 2016, pp. 1-7. , Norfolk, VA; Sharma, D.H., Dhote, C.A., Potey, M.M., Implementing intrusion management as security-as-a-service from cloud (2016) 2016 International Conference on Computation System and Information Technology for Sustainable Solutions (CSITSS), pp. 363-366. , Bangalore; Olagunju, A.O., Samu, F., In search of effective honeypot and honeynet systems for real-time intrusion detection and prevention (2016) Proceedings of the 5th Annual Conference on Research in Information Technology (RIIT '16), pp. 41-46. , ACM New York, NY, USA; Yevdokymenko, M., An adaptive algorithm for detecting and preventing attacks in telecommunication networks (2016) 2016 Third International Scientific-practical Conference Problems of Infocommunications Science and Technology (PIC S&T), pp. 175-177. , Kharkiv; Ford, M., A process to transfer Fail2ban data to an adaptive enterprise intrusion detection and prevention system (2016) SoutheastCon 2016, pp. 1-4. , Norfolk, vol.

Routing plays an important role in providing better services to the users in UVANET. In this paper, a novel routing protocol is proposed for UVANET to support non-safety applications. We consider a non-safety application wherein the drivers and passengers of different parking lots can play multi-player games with each other. To play the games smoothly, the game data should reach the destination in a minimum time. Simulation results show that when the vehicle density in the city area is high, the proposed protocol meets the end-to-end delay tolerance of 100 ms. Finally, an experiment is performed to validate the proposed routing protocol by running a simple puzzle game in a UVANET prototype designed in an indoor laboratory environment and in an outdoor environment. © 2018 Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications","Gaming; Non-safety applications; Routing; Slow-paced games; UVANET",,,,,,,,"Zeadally, S., Hunt, R., Chen, Y.-S., Irwin, A., Hassan, A., Vehicular ad hoc networks (vanets): status, results, and challenges (2012) Telecommun.

This paper aims to design a scheme for the concurrent use of licensed frequencies by Underlay Cognitive Users (UCUs). We develop a new receiver-initiated Medium Access Control (MAC) protocol to facilitate the selections of alternative reliable carrier frequencies. A circuit is designed to establish reliable carrier selections based on the Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) at the receiving end. Based on both packet-level simulations and various performance parameters, a comparison is carried out among conventional techniques, including the Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance (MACA) and MACA by invitation(MACA-BI) techniques, and our scheme. The simulated results demonstrate that when conventional techniques are used, the system overhead time increases from 0.5 s on the first attempt to 16.5 s on the sixth attempt. In the proposed scheme under the same failure condition, overhead time varies from 0.5 s to 2 s. This improvement is due to the complete elimination of the exponential waiting time that occurs during failed transmissions. An average efficiency of 60% is achieved with our scheme while only 43% and 34% average efficiencies are achieved with the MACA and MACA-BI techniques, respectively. The throughput performance of our scheme on the fourth attempt is 7 Mbps, whereas for the MACA and MACA-BI protocols, it is 1.9 Mbps and 2.2 Mbps respectively. © 2017 The Authors","Exponential back-off time; Interference temperature limit; Medium-access control protocol; Received signal strength indicator; Underlay cognitive user",,,,,,,,"Zhao, Q., Sadler, B.M., A survey of dynamic spectrum access (2007) IEEE Signal Process.

Therefore, congestion control has become a promising research area. Nowadays small cell deployment has become a solution to deal with congestion. If large numbers of small cells are allocated for congestion control, then two critical issues will arise: densification and interference management. In such a scenario sector breathing can offer low power congestion control by avoiding densification problem. This paper proposes a power consumption model for sector breathing based congestion control in a mobile network. With sector breathing, a congested cell is sectored at an angle of 60° or 120°. The congested sectors are then identified. The lightly loaded neighbour cells of the congested sector are sectored at 60°. The sectors of the lightly loaded cell capture the border region customers of the adjacent congested sector by increasing the coverage area. When the transmitter antenna of the adjacent lightly loaded sector expands coverage to provide service to the subscribers residing at the border region of the congested sector, the transmitter antenna of the congested sector reduces its coverage area. The simulation results indicate that sector breathing reduces the power transmission of the BS antennas by approximately 6–75% and 62–75% compared cell breathing and dense femtocell allocation based congestion controls respectively. Simulation results also show that sector breathing reduces the power consumption of the BS antennas by approximately 6–64% and 82–90% compared with the cell breathing and dense femtocell allocation based congestion controls, respectively. Hence sector breathing is a green congestion control approach. © 2017 Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommuniocations","Cell breathing; Interference; Power; Sectoring",,,,,,"Department of Science and Technology, Government of Kerala: SERB/F/5044/2012-2013","Authors are grateful to Department of Science and Technology (DST) for sanctioning a research Project entitled “Dynamic Optimization of Green Mobile Networks: Algorithm, Architecture and Applications” under Fast Track Young Scientist scheme reference no.: SERB/F/5044/2012-2013 and No.DST/INSPIRE Fellowship/2013/327 under which this article has been completed.","Alsharif, M.H., Nordin, R., Ismail, M., Classification, recent advances and research challenges in energy efficient cellular networks (2014) Wirel.

As a novel viewpoint, the windows not only allow pulse shaping without front-end pulse-shaping filter, but also increase the performance of the spectrum sensing unit, which can efficiently be implemented into this frequency domain receiver and may further be used for spectrum sensing in cognitive radios or narrowband interference cancellation in military radios. The proposed receiver is applicable for the initial time synchronization of different signals containing a preamble. These signals include single carrier, constant envelope single carrier, multicarrier, and even generalized multicarrier signals, making the proposed receiver structure a universal unit. Furthermore, the receiver can be used to perform filtering with long codes and compute the sliding correlation of an unknown periodic preamble. The receiver can further be modified to handle large Doppler shifts. We will also demonstrate herein the computational complexity and analysis of the acquisition performance in Rayleigh and Rician fading channels. © 2017 The Authors","Matched filters; Pseudonoise coded communication; Synchronization",,,,,,,,"Ergen, M., Mobile Broadband: Including WiMAX and LTE (2009), Springer Science & Business Media; Halonen, T., Romero, J., Melero, J., GSM, GPRS and Edge Performance: Evolution towards 3G/UMTS (2004), John Wiley & Sons; Farahani, S., ZigBee Wireless Networks and Transceivers (2011), Newnes/Elsevier; Prasad, R., Ruggieri, M., Applied Satellite Navigation Using GP, GALILEO and Augmentation Systems (2005), first ed.

IoT services are a key solution for providing smart environments in homes, buildings, and cities. In the era of massive number of connected things and objects with high growth rate, several challenges have been raised, such as management, aggregation, and storage for big produced data. To address some of these issues, cloud computing emerged to the IoT as Cloud of Things (CoT), which provides virtually unlimited cloud services to enhance the large-scale IoT platforms. There are several factors to be considered in the design and implementation of a CoT platform. One of the most important and challenging problems is the heterogeneity of different objects. This problem can be addressed by deploying a suitable “middleware” which sits between things and applications as a reliable platform for communication among things with different interfaces, operating systems, and architectures. The main aim of this paper is to study the middleware technologies for CoT. Toward this end, we first present the main features and characteristics of middlewares. Next, we study different architecture styles and service domains. Then, we present several middlewares that are suitable for CoT-based platforms and finally, a list of current challenges and issues in the design of CoT-based middlewares is discussed. © 2017 The Authors","Cloud; CoT; Fog computing; IoT; Middleware",,,,,,,,"Evans, D., The internet of things-how the next evolution of the internet is changing everything, Tech.

Motivated to solve these challenges, a new technology is driving a trend that shifts the function of centralized cloud computing to edge devices of networks. Several edge computing technologies originating from different backgrounds to decrease latency, improve SE, and support the massive machine type of communication have been emerging. This paper comprehensively presents a tutorial on three typical edge computing technologies, namely mobile edge computing, cloudlets, and fog computing. In particular, the standardization efforts, principles, architectures, and applications of these three technologies are summarized and compared. From the viewpoint of radio access network, the differences between mobile edge computing and fog computing are highlighted, and the characteristics of fog computing-based radio access network are discussed. Finally, open issues and future research directions are identified as well. © 2018 Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications","Cloudlets; Fog computing; Internet of Things (IoT); Mobile edge computing",,,,,,"National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program): 2013CB336600

The major concern in UDN deployment is the backhaul network, which should be scalable, cost-effective, and have sufficient capacity to support massive small cell traffic. Otherwise, the backhaul can become the bottleneck of the network. In this paper, we propose a wireless backhaul solution for UDN deployment by considering MultiPath-MultiHop (MPMH) backhaul architecture in mmWave frequency band. In addition, we propose a distributed routing scheme to forward the backhaul traffic over the multihop network. Backhaul capacity and line-of-sight probability of the proposed backhaul architecture for various picocell densities were compared with direct, multiple-association, and multihop backhaul schemes under interference limited scenarios in outdoor and indoor small cell deployments. The simulation results indicate that the MPMH mmWave backhaul is the most cost-effective and scalable solution for UDN deployment. © 2018 Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications","Backhaul; mmWave; Multihop; Small cells; UDN; Unlicensed band",,,,,,"National Science Fund for Distinguished Young Scholars: 61325004

In order to conserve resources, the proposed algorithm requires the uplink pilot signal only once, at the start of communication. By utilizing the temporal correlation between consecutive Resource Blocks (RBs) and the error correction capability of turbo codes, the channel matrix in subsequent RBs is estimated at the Base Station (BS) itself using the uplink data of current the RB and the estimated channel matrix of previous the RB. Compared to existing blind estimation methods, the proposed method places fewer limitations on the system settings such as the number of BS antennas, the number of users, and the number of coherent channel usage compared to existing blind estimation methods. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm provides better performance for a moderate RB size, a high-order of QAM scheme, and a smaller ratio of the number of BS antennas and mobile terminals (N/K). For a reasonably small N/K (order of 10), the proposed scheme achieves a lower symbol error probability than the conventional pilot-based estimation approach. © 2017 Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommuniocations","Channel estimation; Massive MIMO; Mobile terminal; Resource block; Turbo coding",,,,,,"Science and Engineering Research Board, SERB: YSS/2014/000972","This work was partially funded by SERB, India grant YSS/2014/000972 .","Lu, L., An overview of massive mimo: benefits and challenges (2014) IEEE J.

The high connectivity of intelligent objects and their severe constraints lead to many security challenges, which are not included in the classical formulation of security problems and solutions. The Security Shield for IoT has been identified by DARPA (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency) as one of the four projects with a potential impact broader than the Internet itself. To help interested researchers contribute to this research area, an overview of the IoT security roadmap overview is presented in this paper based on a novel cognitive and systemic approach. The role of each component of the approach is explained, we also study its interactions with the other main components, and their impact on the overall. A case study is presented to highlight the components and interactions of the systemic and cognitive approach. Then, security questions about privacy, trust, identification, and access control are discussed. According to the novel taxonomy of the IoT framework, different research challenges are highlighted, important solutions and research activities are revealed, and interesting research directions are proposed. In addition, current standardization activities are surveyed and discussed to the ensure the security of IoT components and applications. © 2017 The Authors","Access control; Identification; Internet of Things; Privacy; Security; Systemic and cognitive approach; Trust",,,,,,,,"Gubbi, J., Buyya, R., Marusic, S., Palaniswami, M., Internet of things (Iot): a vision, architectural elements, and future directions (2013) Future Gener.

The coexistence of multiple users, often transmitting at significantly different power levels, makes CR receivers vulnerable to spectral leakage caused by components’ nonlinearities and time-truncation of the processed signal records. In this work we propose a method for mitigating the latter with an adaptive choice of the length of the processing block size. With simulations we show that a significant leakage reduction that leads to receiver dynamic range improvement of around 10 dB can be achieved with the proposed method. © 2017 The Authors","Cognitive radio; Dynamic range; Interference; Single carrier block transmission; Spectral leakage; White space",,,,,,,,"Haykin, S., Cognitive radio: brain-empowered wireless communications (2005) IEEE J.

Several enabling technologies are being explored for the 5G mobile system era. The aim is to evolve a cellular network that is intrinsically flexible and remarkably pushes forward the limits of legacy mobile systems across all dimensions of performance metrics. All the stakeholders, such as regulatory bodies, standardization authorities, industrial fora, mobile operators and vendors, must work in unison to bring 5G to fruition. In this paper, we aggregate the 5G-related information coming from the various stakeholders, in order to i) have a comprehensive overview of 5G and ii) to provide a survey of the envisioned 5G technologies; their development thus far from the perspective of those stakeholders will open up new frontiers of services and applications for next-generation wireless networks. © 2018 Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications","5G; ITU; Next-generation wireless networks",,,,,,"FundaÃ§Ã£o para a CiÃªncia e a Tecnologia, FCT: SFRH/BPD/110104/2015","The author, Kazi Mohammed Saidul Huq, would also like to acknowledge the Funda??o para a Ci?ncia e a Tecnologia (FCT) of Portugal; Reference No.: SFRH/BPD/110104/2015.","Ericsson, A.B., http://www.ericsson.com/TET/trafficView/loadBasicEditor.ericsson, “Traffic Exploration Tool,” Online tool.

The complexity of the optimal a posteriori probability (APP) detector increases exponentially with respect to the number of modulated bits per data symbol. Thus, it is necessary to develop low-complexity detection algorithms with an APP-like performance, especially when performing iterative detection, for example in conjunction with bit interleaved coded modulation. We show that a special case of superposition modulation, dubbed Direct Superposition Modulation (DSM), is particularly suitable for complexity reduction at the receiver side. As opposed to square QAM, DSM achieves capacity without active signal shaping. The main contribution is a low-cost detection algorithm for DSM, which enables iterative detection by taking a priori information into account. This algorithm exploits the approximate piecewise linear behavior of the soft outputs of an APP detector over the entire range of detector input values. A theoretical analysis and simulation results demonstrate that at least max-log APP performance can be reached, while the complexity is significantly reduced compared to classical APP detection. © 2018 Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications","Demodulation; Detection algorithms; Digital modulation; Linear approximation",,,,,,"Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG

Repairing and restoring disrupted components in an enterprise data center requires a significant amount of time and human effort. Following a major disruption, the recovery process involves multiple stages, and during each stage, the partially recovered infrastructures can provide limited services to users at some degraded service level. However, how fast and efficiently an enterprise infrastructure can be recovered depends on how the recovery mechanism restores the disrupted components, considering the inter-dependencies between services, along with the limitations of expert human operators. The entire problem turns out to be NP-hard and rather complex, and we devise an efficient meta-heuristic to solve the problem. By considering some real-world examples, we show that the proposed meta-heuristic provides very accurate results, and still runs ∼600–2800 times faster than the optimal solution obtained from a general purpose mathematical solver [1]. © 2017 Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommuniocations","Enterprise data center; Genetic algorithm; Integer linear program; Multi-layer networks; Progressive restoration planning",,,,,,,,"Mitchell, S., Consulting, S.M., Dunning, I., Pulp: A linear programming toolkit for python (2011); http://iwgcr.org/japan-earthquake-puts-data-centers-and-cloud-services-at-risk/; http://www.datacenterdynamics.com/content-tracks/power-cooling/hurricane-sandy-data-center-stories-from-manhattan/72772.fullarticle; https://thestack.com/data-centre/2015/08/19/lightning-wipes-storage-disks-at-google-data-centre/; http://www.americanbanker.com/issues/176/_195/bank-of-america-website-outage-online-banking-1042932-1.html; http://aws.amazon.com/message/65648/; http://www.informationweek.com/data-center-outages-generate-big-losses/d/d-id/1097712?; http://www.drj.com/drj-world-archives/general-dr-planning/feed/Page-1.html; http://www.datacenterdynamics.com/news/the-data-center-skills-gap/75576.fullarticle; http://www.wipro.com/documents/the-impending-data-center-talent-crisis-and-how-to-avert-it.pdf; Baki, M.F., Vickson, R.G., One-operator, two-machine open shop and flow shop problems with setup times for machines and weighted number of tardy jobs objective (2004) Optim.

The rate of growth of mobile devices has been increasing at a very high pace. Mobile devices have made substantial contributions in managing emergency situations. Owing to the mobility of mobile devices, cloudlets, and their intermittent connectivity, it may become very difficult to handle emergency situations. To address this problem, a transmission model is proposed for mobile cloudlet systems, where a mobile device is used to designate a cloudlet by using the Borda scores Method and the mobile device can offload a part of its application to this cloudlet. The simulation results demonstrated that the proposed work makes a significant comtribution toward alleviating the problems associated with emergency situations. © 2018 Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications","BSM; Emergency areas; Mobile cloudlet systems; RNL",,,,,,,,"Zhang, Y., Niyato, D., Wang, P., Tham, C.-K., Dynamic offloading algorithm in intermittently connected mobile cloudlet systems (2014) IEEE Int.

Heavy burst losses strongly affect the Quality of Service (QoS) intended by end users. This article presents a QoS aware Routing and Wavelength Allocation (RWA) technique for burst switching in OBS networks. The RWA problem is modeled as a bi-objective Integer Linear Programming (ILP) problem, where objective functions are based on minimizing the number of wavelengths used and the number of hops traversed to fulfill the burst transmission requests for a given set of node pairs. The ILP model is solved using a novel approach based on a Differential Evolution (DE) algorithm. Analytical results show that the DE algorithm provides a better performance compared to shortest path routing, which is a widely accepted routing strategy for OBS networks. © 2018 Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications","burst loss; differential evolution; integer linear programming; optical burst switching; quality of service; routing and wavelength assignment",,,,,,,,"Chen, Y., Qiao, C., Yu, X., Optical burst switching: a new area in optical networking research (2004) IEEE Netw., 18 (3), pp. 16-23; Xiong, Y., Vandenhoute, M., Cankaya, H.C., Control architecture in optical burst-switched WDM networks (2000) IEEE J.

Relay selection algorithms can be used to choose the optimal relay, which help in reducing the computational complexity during the signal processing operation of the wireless network. In this research work, a conventional Amplify-Forward (AF)/Decode-Forward (DF) assisted multi-relay IEEE 802.16j WiMAX network is considered. The effects of relay selection algorithms on the performance metrics such as Symbol Error Rate (SER) and channel capacity are investigated in detail through simulation-based study. Further, the performance of this network utilizing the proposed relay selection algorithms, namely threshold based max_min and threshold based harmonic mean of SNR, are compared with the existing max_min and harmonic mean of SNR based algorithms. Standard diversity combining techniques such as Maximal Ratio Combining (MRC) and Selection Combining (SC) are used for combining the transmitted signal at the receiver. In addition, the impact of relay locations on the performance metrics are explored. It is observed that both the proposed threshold based max_min and threshold based harmonic mean of SNR based relay selection algorithms outperform the max_min and harmonic mean of SNR based algorithms, as both the SER and channel capacity for the considered multi-relay WiMAX network is improved significantly. Further, this extensive study and analysis will be beneficial for the design of MMR WiMAX networks. © 2018 Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications","Amplify-forward; Decode-forward; MRC; Selection combining; WiMAX",,,,,,,,"Ahmadi, S., An overview of next-generation mobile WiMAX technology - [WiMAX update] (2009) IEEE Commun.

These services are provided over the public channels, which are insecure and susceptible to interception, modification, and deletion. To provide security, registered entities are authenticated and then a session key is established between them to communicate securely. The conventional schemes allow a user to access services only after their independent registration with each desired server in a multiserver system. Therefore, a user must possess multiple smartcards and memorize various identities and passwords for obtaining services from multiple servers. This has led to the adoption of multiserver authentication in which a user accesses services of multiple servers after registering himself at only one central authority. Recently, Kumar and Om discussed a scheme for multiserver environment by using smartcard. Since the user-memorized passwords are of low entropy, it is possible for an attacker to guess them. This paper uses biometric information of user to enhance the security of the scheme by Kumar and Om. Moreover, we conducted rigorous security analyses (informal and formal) in this study to prove the security of the proposed scheme against all known attacks. We also simulated our scheme by using the automated tool, ProVerif, to prove its secrecy and authentication properties. A comparative study of the proposed scheme with the existing related schemes shows its effectiveness. © 2018 Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications","Authentication; Biometric; Multi-server; Password; ProVerif; Security; Smartcard",,,,,,,,"Hwang, M.S., Li, L.H., A new remote user authentication scheme using smart cards (2000) IEEE Trans.

In the United States, the First Responder Network Authority (FirstNet) is on the verge of deploying a nationwide network called the National Public Safety Broadband Network (NPSBN). Commercial networks typically aim at maximizing network capacity, i.e. the aggregate data rate, in order to increase revenue. However, in public safety networks, coverage, not capacity, is paramount, especially during an outage when sites are down. Through traffic control and preemption, the service level of low-priority users is reduced or denied, freeing up resources to restore coverage to high-priority users, e.g. users responding to an incident. In this study, we examine the effect of outages on network coverage and throughput. As our main contribution, we propose three traffic-control schemes that exploit variable modulation and coding, a feature that LTE enhances with respect to its 3G predecessors. The schemes differ based on the proportion of low- and high-priority users preempted. We show that the network coverage can be restored significantly and we investigate the tradeoff between the three schemes. Finally, we perform sensitivity analysis to confirm the effectiveness of the schemes across a wide range of scenarios. © 2018 Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications","Incident; Modeling; Network outage; Network resiliency",,,,,,,,"Law, P., Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012 (2012); (2014) National Public Safety Telecommunications Council, Defining Public Safety Grade Systems and Facilities, , http://www.npstc.org/download.jsp?tableId=37&column=217&id=3066&file=Public_Safety_Grade_Report_140522.pdf; Kwasinski, A., Effects of notable natural disasters from 2005 to 2011 on telecommunications infrastructure: lessons from on-site damage assessments (2011) INTELEC, Int.

The main challenge in a VANET is to ensure routing with a good Quality of Service (QoS). The Greedy Perimeter Stateless Routing (GPSR) protocol is one of the most promising position-based routing mechanisms used to overcome this challenge. Its effectiveness depends entirely on the information on a node's mobility and the precision of this information. By broadcasting periodic beaconing within transmission boundary ranges, GPSR can manage neighbors’ mobility information and maintain up-to-date lists of neighbours. Nevertheless, information on the position of a neighboring vehicle quickly becomes outdated, which negatively influences the efficiency of the routing. In order to monitor information mobility and to increase the QoS in this challenging area, position estimation needs to be considered. Thus, in this study, we examine the position estimation problem, and propose an improvement to the GPSR protocol, named KF-GPSR, where each vehicle estimates in real time the position of its neighbors using the Kalman filter algorithm. Indeed, by employing this strong estimation technique, it is possible to reduce considerably the frequency of exchanged beacon packets, while maintaining high position accuracy. For greater reliability, we also propose an extension to KF-GPSR, called BOD-KF-GPSR, that uses the “beacon-on-demand” process only if a node needs to rediscover its neighborhood. Simulation experiments using the network simulator NS-2 are presented to demonstrate the ability and usefulness of our two proposals. Here, we compare the proposed protocols against diverse common protocols: GPSR, AODV, DSR, and ZRP. The results show that BOD-KF-GPSR achieves a significant enhancement in terms of its packet delivery ratio, routing cost, normalized routing load, end-to-end delay, and throughput. © 2017 Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications","Beacon on demand; Estimation; GPSR; Kalman filter; QOS; Routing; VANET",,,,,,,,"Wang, Y., Li, F., Vehicular ad hoc networks (2009) Guide to Wireless Ad Hoc Networks, pp. 503-525. , Springer; Qureshi, K.N., Abdullah, A.H., Localization-based system challenges in vehicular ad hoc networks: Survey (2014) Smart CR, 4 (6), pp. 515-528; Singh, A., Kumar, M., Rishi, R., Madan, D., A Relative Study of Manet and Vanet: its Applications, Broadcasting Approaches and Challenging Issues (2011), pp. 627-632. , Advances in Networks and Communications; Liang, W., Li, Z., Zhang, H., Wang, S., Bie, R., Vehicular ad hoc networks: architectures, research issues, methodologies, challenges, and trends (2015) Int.

Wyner's wiretap coding ensures a security constraint and reliability, but results in a decrease of achievable rate. To mitigate the loss in secrecy rate, we propose a coding scheme in which we use sufficiently old messages as key and prove that multiple messages are secure with respect to all the information possessed by the eavesdropper. We also show that we can achieve security in the strong sense. Next, we study a fading wiretap channel with full channel state information of the eavesdropper's channel and use our coding/decoding scheme to achieve a secrecy capacity close to the Shannon capacity of the main channel (in the ergodic sense). Finally, we study a case where the transmitter does not have instantaneous information of the channel state of the eavesdropper, but only its distribution. © 2018 Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications","Physical layer security; Rate loss; Secrecy capacity; Secret key; Wiretap channel",,,,,,,,"Wyner, A.D., The wire-tap channel (1975) Bell Syst.

To support various mobile applications, the Third-Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) defined multiple Quality-of-Service (QoS) class identifiers so that application data can be treated differently to meet the QoS requirements. Meanwhile, to prolong the battery lifetime of mobile devices, the 3GPP specified the Discontinuous Reception (DRX) mechanism for LTE-A systems as a power saving function. More energy saving often implies performance degradation or worse QoS support. In this study, we address the issue of energy saving with DRX while maintaining QoS support for LTE-A systems. Unlike previous studies that analyzed average packet delay under the DRX mechanism, we evaluate the effect on packet loss ratio due to the violation of delay bound requirements. The problem is formulated by maximizing the energy saving efficiency subject to the constraint that the packet loss ratio does not exceed a predetermined threshold. We derive packet loss ratio as a function of DRX parameters and propose an algorithm to efficiently configure these parameters. The proposed analytical model is verified through simulations. According to numerical results, the energy saving efficiency achieved by the proposed algorithm is very close to that of the optimum setting. © 2018 Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications","Delay bound; Discontinuous Reception (DRX); Long-Term Evolution-Advanced (LTE-A); Packet loss ratio; Quality-of-Service (QoS)",,,,,,"Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan, MOST: 104-2221-E-009-086-MY2","This work was supported by grant MOST 104-2221-E-009-086-MY2.","(2013) “Evolved Universal Terrestrial Radio Access (E-utra) and Evolved Universal Terrestrial Radio Access Network (E-utran); Overall Description; Stage 2,” 3GPP TS 36.300, Rel. 11, Ver. 11.7.0; (2014) “General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) Enhancements for Evolved Universal Terrestrial Radio Access Network (E-utran) Access” 3GPP TS 23.401, Rel. 12, Ver. 12.7.0; (2013) “Evolved Universal Terrestrial Radio Access (E-utra); Media Access Control (MAC); Protocol Specification,” 3GPP TS 36.321, Rel. 11, Ver. 11.3.0; (2014) “Technical Specification Group Radio Access Network; Medium Access Control (MAC) Protocol Specification,” 3GPP TS 25.321, Rel. 12, Ver. 12.2.0; (1998) “Selection Procedures for the Choice of Radio Transmission Technologies of UMTS,” ETSI TR 101 112 (UMTS 30.03, Ver. 3.2.0); (2013) “Evolved Universal Terrestrial Radio Access (E-utra); Radio Resource Control (RRC) Protocol Specification,” 3GPP TS 36.331, Rel. 11, Ver. 11.5.0; Bontu, C.S., Illidge, E., “DRX mechanism for power saving in LTE” (2009) IEEE Commun.

Some physical reasons include a very high temperature, a heavy load over a node, and heavy rain. Computational reasons could be a third-party intrusive attack, communication conflicts, or congestion. Automated fault diagnosis has been a well-studied problem in the research community. In this paper, we present an automated fault diagnosis model that can diagnose multiple types of faults in the category of hard faults and soft faults. Our proposed model implements a feed-forward neural network trained with a hybrid metaheuristic algorithm that combines the principles of exploration and exploitation of the search space. The proposed methodology consists of different phases such as a clustering phase, a fault detection and classification phase, and a decision and diagnosis phase. The implemented methodology can diagnose composite faults such as hard permanent, soft permanent, intermittent, and transient faults for sensor nodes as well as for links. The proposed implementation can also classify different types of faulty behavior for both sensor nodes and links in the network. We present the obtained theoretical results and computational complexity of the implemented model for this particular study on automated fault diagnosis. The performance of the model is evaluated using simulations and experiments conducted using indoor and outdoor testbeds. © 2018 Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications","Fault diagnosis; Link failures; Meta-heuristic algorithm; Neural networks; Wireless sensor network",,,,,,,,,"Swain, R.R.; Department of Computer Science and Engineering, National Institute of Technology RourkelaIndia; email: 514cs1006@nitrkl.ac.in",,,"Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications",,,,,24685925,,,,"English","Digit.

Because of the potentially large number of coexisting MTC devices, achieving efficient device management and signaling is an essential issue. Moreover, many MTC devices are battery-operated and require a long battery life. It is difficult to achieve low power consumption using MTC devices with limited control signaling overhead. To accomplish this, this study proposes a group-based power-control scheme. To reduce signaling overhead, the proposed scheme assigns one ID and one power-control parameter to a group of MTC links that are allocated on the same resource block. To maintain low power consumption, we formulate a resource allocation problem that aims to minimize the power consumed by MTC links. We propose a greedy algorithm to solve this problem. Numerical results show that the proposed scheme can achieve low power consumption and low signaling overhead. © 2018 Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications","Communication system signaling; Device-to-device communication; Grouping; Machine-type communications; Radio resource allocation",,,,,,,,,"Yang, Z.-Y.; Institute of Communication Engineering, National Chiao Tung UniversityTaiwan; email: yang.cm97g@gmail.com",,,"Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications",,,,,24685925,,,,"English","Digit.

They are widely used in both industry and academia. In spite of such exponential growth, these technologies lack adequate measures to protect data from misuse/abuse. Corporations that collect data from multiple sources are at risk of liabilities due to the exposure of sensitive information. In the current implementation of Hadoop, only file-level access control is feasible. Providing users with the ability to access data based on the attributes in a dataset or the user's role is complicated because of the sheer volume and multiple formats (structured, unstructured and semi-structured) of data. In this paper, we propose an access control framework, which enforces access control policies dynamically based on the sensitivity of the data. This framework enforces access control policies by harnessing the data context, usage patterns and information sensitivity. Information sensitivity changes over time with the addition and removal of datasets, which can lead to modifications in access control decisions. The proposed framework accommodates these changes. The proposed framework is automated to a large extent as the data itself determines the sensitivity with minimal user intervention. Our experimental results show that the proposed framework is capable of enforcing access control policies on non-multimedia datasets with minimal overhead. © 2017 Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommuniocations","Access control; Data driven information sensitivity; Information value; Privacy",,,,,,,,"Schmidt, E., http://techcrunch.com/2010/08/04/schmidt-data/, Tech-crunch article on data production, [09-22-2014]; Cavoukian, A., Chibba, M., Williamson, G., Ferguson, A., The Importance of ABAC: Attribute-based Access Control to Big Data: Privacy and Context (2015), http://www.ryerson.ca/content/dam/pbdi/Resources/The%20Importance%20of%20ABAC%20to%20Big%20Data%2005-2015.pdf, [08-25-2015]; Wikipedia, A.O.L., Leak, D., http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AOL_search_data_leak, [09-23-2014]; Narayanan, A., Shmatikov, V., Robust de-anonymization of large sparse datasets (2008) Security and Privacy, 2008.

Big data can be structured, unstructured, or semi structured. Hadoop is an open source framework that is used to process large amounts of data in an inexpensive and efficient way, and job scheduling is a key factor for achieving high performance in big data processing. This paper gives an overview of big data and highlights the problems and challenges in big data. It then highlights Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS), Hadoop MapReduce, and various parameters that affect the performance of job scheduling algorithms in big data such as Job Tracker, Task Tracker, Name Node, Data Node, etc. The primary purpose of this paper is to present a comparative study of job scheduling algorithms along with their experimental results in Hadoop environment. In addition, this paper describes the advantages, disadvantages, features, and drawbacks of various Hadoop job schedulers such as FIFO, Fair, capacity, Deadline Constraints, Delay, LATE, Resource Aware, etc, and provides a comparative study among these schedulers. © 2017 Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications","Benchmark; Big Data; Classification; Hadoop; HDFS; Locality; MapReduce; Scheduler",,,,,,"Wuhan Municipal Science and Technology Bureau: 2017010201010118","This work is supported by the Applied Basic Research Program funded by Wuhan Science and Technology Bureau (Grant No. 2017010201010118 ).","Rao, B.T., Reddy, L.S.S., Survey on improved scheduling in hadoop MapReduce in cloud environments (2012) Int.

Therefore, greater attention has been directed on being able deciphering better methods for identifying attack types to train IDSs more effectively. Keycyber-attack insights exist in big data; however, an efficient approach is required to determine strong attack types to train IDSs to become more effective in key areas. Despite the rising growth in IDS research, there is a lack of studies involving big data visualization, which is key. The KDD99 data set has served as a strong benchmark since 1999; therefore, we utilized this data set in our experiment. In this study, we utilized hash algorithm, a weight table, and sampling method to deal with the inherent problems caused by analyzing big data; volume, variety, and velocity. By utilizing a visualization algorithm, we were able to gain insights into the KDD99 data set with a clear identification of “normal” clusters and described distinct clusters of effective attacks. © 2017 Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications","Big data visualization; MDS; PCA; Sampling method",,,,,,,,"Van Der Maaten, L., Accelerating t-sne using tree-based algorithms (2014) J.

These data are used for analyzing the power state and formulating the optimal dispatching strategy. However, these big energy data in terms of volume, velocity and variety raise concern over consumers’ privacy. For instance, in order to optimize energy utilization and support demand response, numerous smart meters are installed at a consumer's home to collect energy consumption data at a fine granularity, but these fine-grained data may contain information on the appliances and thus the consumer's behaviors at home. In this paper, we propose a privacy-preserving data aggregation scheme based on secret sharing with fault tolerance in a smart grid, which ensures that the control center obtains the integrated data without compromising privacy. Meanwhile, we also consider fault tolerance and resistance to differential attack during the data aggregation. Finally, we perform a security analysis and performance evaluation of our scheme in comparison with the other similar schemes. The analysis shows that our scheme can meet the security requirement, and it also shows better performance than other popular methods. © 2017 Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications","Big data; Fault tolerance; Privacy-preserving; Smart grid",,,,,,"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities: 2016MS29

In this paper, we propose a new algorithm for securing the outsourcing of composite modular exponentiation, which is one of the most complex computing tasks in discrete-log based cryptographic protocols. Unlike algorithms based on two untrusted servers, we outsource modular exponentiation operation to only a single server, which eliminates the potential for a collusion attack when using two servers. Moreover, our proposed algorithm can hide the base and exponent of the outsourced data, which prevents the exposure of sensitive information to cloud servers. In addition, compared with the state-of-the-art algorithms, our scheme has remarkably better checkability.

Security and privacy are the most concerned issues in Big Data. Big Data definitely desires the security and privacy protection all through the collection, transmission and analysis procedures. The features of Big Data bring unprecedented challenges to security and privacy protection. To protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability, traditional security measures such as cryptography, event analysis, intrusion detection, prevention and access control have taken a new dimension. To protect the privacy, new pattern of measures such as privacy-preserved data analysis need to be explored. There is a lot of work to be done in this emerging field. The purpose of this special issue is to make the security and privacy communities realizing the challenges and tasks that we face in Big Data. We focus on exploring the security and privacy aspects of Big Data as supporting and indispensable elements of the emerging Big Data research. We received a large number of submissions from many countries. After a rigorous review and revision process, we assembled six papers on the latest advances in state-of-the-art of Big Data security and privacy, covering different perspectives of big data security and privacy, including access control, authentication, cloud outsourcing, virtualization, privacy in smart grid, and big data job scheduling. In “Content Sensitivity Based Access Control Framework for Big Data.” Kumar et al. propose an access control framework, which enforces access control policies dynamically based on the sensitivity of the data. This framework enforces access control policies by harnessing the data context, usage patterns and information sensitivity. They also prove the effectiveness of the proposed method through experiments. Li et al., in “A Distributed Authentication and Authorization Scheme for In-Network Big Data Sharing,” propose a Distributed Authentication and Authorization Scheme (DAAS) to achieve identity verification and fine-grained authorization in a distributed manner for the pervasive in-network big data sharing environment. In the performance evaluations, the authors show that the DAAS can achieve lower bandwidth cost compared to the existing schemes. In “CEXP: Secure and Verifiable Outsourcing of Composite Modular Exponentiation with Single Untrusted Server,” Li et al. present a new and efficient algorithms for secure outsourcing of composite modular exponentiation based on a single server. Comparing with the state-of-the-art algorithms, their scheme has a remarkable improvement in verification capability, enabling users to detect any misbehaviour with the optimal probability 1. In the paper titled “Achieving Privacy-Preserving Big Data Aggregation with Fault Tolerance in Smart Grid,” Guan and Si propose a privacy-preserving data aggregation scheme based on secret sharing with fault tolerance in smart grid, which ensures that control center gets the integrated data without compromising user's privacy. Meanwhile, they also consider fault tolerance and the resistance to differential attack during the data aggregation. Ruan and the co-authors present the paper, “Visualization for big data security: a case study on KDD99 cup data set”. They argue that despite the rising research growth in IDS, it suffers from lack of work on big data visualization. The authors utilize a hash algorithm, a weight table and sampling method to deal with the big data problems in volume, variety and velocity. By utilizing a visualization algorithm, researchers are able to gain insights into the KDD99 data set with a clear identification of ‘normal’ clusters and describe distinct clusters of effective attacks. Usama et al. offer an extensive survey on big data processing, titled “Job Schedulers for Big Data Processing in Hadoop Environment: A Survey.” They thoroughly investigate the job scheduling methods in Hadoop. Moreover, the authors also describe advantages, disadvantages, features, and a comparative study of various Hadoop job scheduling algorithms, such as, FIFO, fair, capacity, deadline constraints, delay, and resource aware scheduling.

Information-centric networking (ICN) is an emerging approach to satisfy this demand, where big data is cached ubiquitously in the network and retrieved using data names. However, existing authentication and authorization schemes rely mostly on centralized servers to provide certification and mediation services for data retrieval. This causes considerable traffic overhead for the secure distributed sharing of data. To solve this problem, we employ identity-based cryptography (IBC) to propose a Distributed Authentication and Authorization Scheme (DAAS), where an identity-based signature (IBS) is used to achieve distributed verifications of the identities of publishers and users. Moreover, Ciphertext-Policy Attribute-based encryption (CP-ABE) is used to enable the distributed and fine-grained authorization. DAAS consists of three phases: initialization, secure data publication, and secure data retrieval, which seamlessly integrate authentication and authorization with the interest/data communication paradigm in ICN. In particular, we propose trustworthy registration and Network Operator and Authority Manifest (NOAM) dissemination to provide initial secure registration and enable efficient authentication for global data retrieval. Meanwhile, Attribute Manifest (AM) distribution coupled with automatic attribute update is proposed to reduce the cost of attribute retrieval. We examine the performance of the proposed DAAS, which shows that it can achieve a lower bandwidth cost than existing schemes. © 2017 Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommuniocations","Access control; Authentication; Big data; In-network data sharing; Information-centric network; Security",,,,,,"ICN2020

In the existing bilayer coding scheme, these parity bits are protected by an error correcting code and assumed reliably available at the receiver. We propose an uncoded relaying scheme, where the extra parity bits are forwarded to the destination without any protection. Through density evolution analysis and simulation results, we show that our proposed scheme achieves better performance in terms of bit erasure probability than the existing relaying scheme.

In an inherently lossy, unreliable and dynamic medium such as wireless, the task of accurate estimation becomes very challenging. Over the years ETX has been widely used as a reliable link quality estimation metric. However, more recently it has been established that under heavy traffic loads ETX performance gets significantly worse. We examine the ETX metric's behavior in detail with respect to the MAC layer and UDP data; and identify the causes of its unreliability. Motivated by the observations made in our analysis, we present the design and implementation of our link quality measurement metric xDDR – a variation of ETX. This article extends xDDR to support network mobility. Our experiments show that xDDR substantially outperforms minimum hop count, ETX and HETX in terms of end-to-end packet delivery ratio in static as well as mobile scenarios. © 2017 Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommuniocations","Asymmetric link quality; Link-quality measurement; Wireless ad hoc networks",,,,,,,,"Afzal, S.R., Nabi, M., Stuijk, S., Basten, T., Improving end-to-end packet delivery in high traffic multi-hop wireless ad hoc networks (2015) in: Proceedings of the 8th International Conference on Mobile Multimedia Communications MobiMedia; Baccour, N., Koubaa, A., Mottola, L., Zuniga, M., Youssef, H., Boano, C., Alves, M., (2012), Radio link quality estimation in wireless sensor networks: A survey.

The networks may have different characteristics in terms of multiple attributes. CRs will have choices of selecting the optimal network out of the available networks. Optimal network selection is a challenging task that can be performed by spectrum handoff with Multiple Attribute Decision Making (MADM). The spectrum handoff decision with MADM provides wider and optimal choice with quality of service. This motivates the devolopment of a spectrum handoff scheme with MADM methods such as simple additive weighting, a technique for order preference by similarity to the ideal solution, a grey relational analysis and a cost function based method, which is the objective of this study. The CR preferences are based on voice, video and data services, called triple play services. The numerical results show that all MADM methods are effective for selecting the optimal network for spectrum handoff with a reduced complexity for the spectrum handoff decision. The paper shows that the proposed spectrum handoff scheme can be effectively implemented to select the optimal network according to triple play services in CR networks. © 2017 Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommuniocations","Cognitive radio; Cost function; GRA; SAW; Spectrum handoff; TOPSIS",,,,,,,,"Mitola, J., Maguire, G.Q., Cognitive radio: making software radios more personal (1999) IEEE Pers.

Flippped learning and Internet of Things (IoTs) concepts have gained significant attention in recent years. Using these concepts in conjunction with CBL can improve learning ability by providing real evolutionary medical cases. It also enables students to build confidence in their decision making, and efficiently enhances teamwork in the learing environment. We propose an IoT-based Flip Learning Platform, called IoTFLiP, where an IoT infrastructure is exploited to support flipped case-based learning in a cloud environment with state of the art security and privacy measures for personalized medical data. It also provides support for application delivery in private, public, and hybrid approaches. The proposed platform is an extension of our Interactive Case-Based Flipped Learning Tool (ICBFLT), which has been developed based on current CBL practices. ICBFLT formulates summaries of CBL cases through synergy between students’ and medical expert knowledge. The low cost and reduced size of sensor device, support of IoTs, and recent flipped learning advancements can enhance medical students’ academic and practical experiences. In order to demonstrate a working scenario for the proposed IoTFLiP platform, real-time data from IoTs gadgets is collected to generate a real-world case for a medical student using ICBFLT. © 2017 Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommuniocations","Case-based learning; Cloud environment; Flipped learning; Internet of things; Medical education",,,,,,"Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning, MSIP: 2011-0030079, 10049079

Various location-centric routing protocols have been suggested in literature for road safety ITS applications considering urban and highway traffic environment. This paper characterizes vehicular environments based on real traffic data and investigates the evolution of location-centric data dissemination. The current study is carried out with three main objectives: (i) to analyze the impact of dynamic traffic environment on the design of data dissemination techniques, (ii) to characterize location-centric data dissemination in terms of functional and qualitative behavior of protocols, properties, and strengths and weaknesses, and (iii) to find some future research directions in information dissemination based on location. Vehicular traffic environments have been classified into three categories based on physical characteristics such as speed, inter-vehicular distance, neighborhood stability, traffic volume, etc. Real traffic data is considered to analyze on-road traffic environments based on the measurement of physical parameters and weather conditions. Design issues are identified in incorporating physical parameters and weather conditions into data dissemination. Functional and qualitative characteristics of location-centric techniques are explored considering urban and highway environments. Comparative analysis of location-centric techniques is carried out for both urban and highway environments individually based on some unique and common characteristics of the environments. Finally, some future research directions are identified in the area based on the detailed investigation of traffic environments and location-centric data dissemination techniques. © 2017 Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommuniocations","Analysis of real traffic data; Evolution of geocast routing; Geocast routing; location-centric data dissemination; VANETs survey; Vehicular ad hoc networks",,,,,,,,"Kaiwartya, O., Abdullah, A.H., Cao, Y., Altameem, A., Prasad, M., Lin, C.T., Liu, X., Internet of vehicles: motivation, layered architecture, network model, challenges, and future aspects (2016) IEEE Access, 4, pp. 5356-5373; http://www.delhi.gov.in/wps/wcm/connect/DoIT_Planning/planning/important+links/an+ approach+to+12th+five+year+plan+%282012-17%29, Govt. of NCT of Delhi, An Approach to 12th Five Year Plan: Transport Department.

Particularly, the complexity of the optimal a posteriori probability (APP) detector increases exponentially with respect to the number of bits per data symbol. This statement is also true for the Max-Log-APP detector, which is a common simplification of the APP detector. Thus it is important to design new detection algorithms which combine a sufficient performance with low complexity. In this contribution, a detection algorithm for two-dimensional digital modulation schemes which cannot be split-up into real and imaginary parts (like phase shift keying and phase-shifted superposition modulation (PSM)) is proposed with emphasis on PSM with equal power allocation. This algorithm exploits the relationship between Max-Log-APP detection and a Voronoi diagram to determine planar surfaces of the soft outputs over the entire range of detector input values. As opposed to state-of-the-art detectors based on Voronoi surfaces, a priori information is taken into account, enabling iterative processing. Since the algorithm achieves Max-Log-APP performance, even in the presence of a priori information, this implies a great potential for complexity reduction compared to the classical APP detection. © 2017 Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommuniocations","Demodulation; Detection algorithms; Digital modulation; Linear approximation",,,,,,"Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG: HO2226/14-1

Security in vehicular ad hoc networks is crucial to the reliable exchange of information and control data. In this paper, we propose an intelligent Intrusion Detection System (IDS) to protect the external communication of self-driving and semi self-driving vehicles. This technology has the ability to detect Denial of Service (DoS) and black hole attacks on vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs). The advantage of the proposed IDS over existing security systems is that it detects attacks before they causes significant damage. The intrusion prediction technique is based on Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) and Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA) which are used to predict attacks based on observed vehicle behavior. We perform simulations using Network Simulator 2 to demonstrate that the IDS achieves a low rate of false alarms and high accuracy in detection. © 2017 Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommuniocations","IDS; Linear and quadratic discriminant analysis; Secure communication; Self-driving vehicles; Vehicle ad hoc networks",,,,,,"Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, EPSRC: EP/K004638/1

Recently, Network Connectivity Proxy (NCP) concept has been proposed in literature as an effective mechanism to exploit full potential of low power features on network devices by impersonating their virtual presence. However, the NCP concept faces several open issues and challenges especially related to proxying of TCP connections and majority of daily used proprietary closed-source applications. This paper presents a new approach for reducing network energy waste through intelligent collaboration among daily used devices (e.g., desktop computers, laptops, tablets, smartphones, etc). It guarantees to run applications on only and only one user device that is under active use at that specific moment. To reduce energy waste and allow idle devices to sleep, our approach also takes benefit from a light-weight home gateway proxy with very basic practically realizable functionalities. The proposed system not just reduces energy waste of fixed devices but also enables mobile devices to significantly improve their battery life. Our developed software prototypes allow devices to autonomously and seamlessly collaborate with each other without requiring any configuration or user input. Further, this paper also presents the basic performance evaluation of developed prototypes in real networking environments. © 2016 Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommuniocations","Energy efficiency; Green networking; Home gateway proxy; Power measurement; Smartphone; Universal Plug & Play",,,,,,,,"Bolla, R., Khan, R., Repetto, M., Assessing the potential for saving energy by impersonating idle networked devices (2016) IEEE J.

Cloud service performance has a significant impact on performance of the future information infrastructure. Thorough evaluation on Cloud service performance is crucial and beneficial to both service providers and consumers; thus forming an active research area. Some key technologies for Cloud computing, such as virtualization and the Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA), bring in special challenges to service performance evaluation. A tremendous amount of effort has been put by the research community to address these challenges and exciting progress has been made. Among the work on Cloud performance analysis, evaluation approaches developed with a system modeling perspective play an important role. However, related works have been reported in different sections of the literature; thus lacking a big picture that shows the latest status of this area. The objectives of this article is to present a survey that reflects the state of the art of Cloud service performance evaluation from the system modeling perspective.

Indisputably, for this promise to ever materialise, CRN must of necessity devise appropriate mechanisms to judiciously allocate their rather scarce or limited resources (spectrum and others) among their numerous users. ‘Resource allocation (RA) in CRN', which essentially describes mechanisms that can effectively and optimally carry out such allocation, so as to achieve the utmost for the network, has therefore recently become an important research focus. However, in most research works on RA in CRN, a highly significant factor that describes a more realistic and practical consideration of CRN has been ignored (or only partially explored), i.e., the aspect of the heterogeneity of CRN. To address this important aspect, in this paper, RA models that incorporate the most essential concepts of heterogeneity, as applicable to CRN, are developed and the imports of such inclusion in the overall networking are investigated. Furthermore, to fully explore the relevance and implications of the various heterogeneous classifications to the RA formulations, weights are attached to the different classes and their effects on the network performance are studied. In solving the developed complex RA problems for heterogeneous CRN, a solution approach that examines and exploits the structure of the problem in achieving a less-complex reformulation, is extensively employed. This approach, as the results presented show, makes it possible to obtain optimal solutions to the rather difficult RA problems of heterogeneous CRN. © 2017 Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommuniocations","Cognitive radio network; Heterogeneous system; Linear and non-linear programming; Resource allocation",,,,,,,,"Doyle, L.E., Essentials of Cognitive Radio, The Cambridge Wireless Essentials Series (2009), Cambridge University Press New York, USA; Fette, B.A., Cognitive Radio Technology (2006), Communications Engineering Series, Newness (Elsevier) Publications, Burlington, MA, USA; Liang, Y.-C., Chen, K.-C., Li, G., Mahonen, P., Cognitive radio networking and communications: an overview (2011) IEEE Trans.

In this paper, a novel idea of compensating the fractional time varying communication delay in the sliding surface is presented. The fractional time delay in the sensor to controller and controller to actuator channel is approximated using the Thiran approximation technique to design the sliding surface. A discrete-time sliding mode control law is derived using the proposed surface that compensates fractional time delay in sensor to controller and controller to actuator channels for uncertain network control systems. The sufficient condition for closed loop stability of the system is derived using the Lyapunov function. The efficacy of the proposed strategy is supported by the simulation results. © 2016 Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommuniocations","Discrete-time sliding mode control; Network delay; Networked control",,,,,,,,"Cac, N., Hung, N., Khang, N., CAN-based networked control systems: a compensation for communication time delays (2014) Am.

The range of the potential application of FSO networks is extensive, from home to satellite. However, FSO networks have not been popularized because of insufficient availability and reliability. Researchers have focused on the problems in the physical layer in order to exploit the properties of wireless optical channels. However, recent technological developments with successful results make it practical to explore the advantages of the high bandwidth. Some researchers have begun to focus on the problems of network and upper layers in FSO networks. In this survey, we classify prospective global FSO networks into three subnetworks and give an account of them.

Along with this, RF communication requires a separate setup for transmission and reception of RF waves. Overcoming the above limitations, Visible Light Communication (VLC) is a preferred communication technique because of its high bandwidth and immunity to interference from electromagnetic sources. The revolution in the field of solid state lighting leads to the replacement of florescent lamps by Light Emitting Diodes (LEDs) which further motivates the usage of VLC.

The dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS) has been widely adopted by laptop computers, servers, and mobile devices to conserve energy, while the GPU DVFS is still at a certain early age. This paper aims at exploring the impact of GPU DVFS on the application performance and power consumption, and furthermore, on energy conservation. We survey the state-of-the-art GPU DVFS characterizations, and then summarize recent research works on GPU power and performance models. We also conduct real GPU DVFS experiments on NVIDIA Fermi and Maxwell GPUs. According to our experimental results, GPU DVFS has significant potential for energy saving. The effect of scaling core voltage/frequency and memory voltage/frequency depends on not only the GPU architectures, but also the characteristic of GPU applications. © 2017 Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommuniocations","Dynamic voltage and frequency scaling; Energy efficiency; Graphics processing unit",,,,,,"SCI-2015-SZTIC-002

Network Coding (NC) is an innovative technique that has potential to improve the efficiency of multicast content distribution over multihop Wireless Mesh Networks (WMNs) by allowing intermediate Forwarding Nodes (FNs) to encode and then forward data packets. Practical protocols are needed to realize the benefits of the NC technique. However, the existing NC-based multicast protocols cannot accurately determine the minimum number of coded packets that a FN should send in order to ensure successful data delivery to the destinations, so that many redundant packets are injected into the network, leading to performance degradation. In this paper, we propose HopCaster, a novel reliable multicast protocol that incorporates network coding with hop-by-hop transport. HopCaster completely eliminates the need for estimating the number of coded packets to be transmitted by a FN, and avoids redundant packet transmissions. It also effectively addresses the challenges of heterogeneous multicast receivers. Moreover, a cross-layer multicast rate adaptation mechanism is proposed, which enables HopCaster to optimize multicast throughput by dynamically adjusting wireless transmission rate based on the changes in the receiver population and channel conditions during the course of multicasting a coded data chunk. Our evaluations show that HopCaster significantly outperforms the existing NC-based multicast protocols. © 2016 Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommuniocations","Content distribution; Hop-by-hop transport; Multicast; Network coding; Rate adaptation",,,,,,,,"Cisco visual networking index: forecast and methodology (2014), http://www.cisco.com; Lecompte, D., Gabin, F., Evolved multimedia broadcast/multicast service (embms) in lte-advanced: overview and rel-11 enhancements (2012), IEEE Commun.

The sensitivity of the applications requires adaptive; efficient; delay bounded and scalable communication network among UAVs for data transmission. Due to communication protocol complexity; rigidity; cost of commercial-off-the-shelf (COT) components; limited radio bandwidth; high mobility and computational resources; maintaining the desired level of Quality of Service (QoS) becomes a daunting task. For the first time in this research we propose multicluster FANETs for efficient network management; the proposed scheme considerably reduces communication cost and optimizes network performance as well as exploit low power; less complex and low cost IEEE 802.15.4 (MAC) protocol for intercluster and intracluster communication. In this research both beacon enabled mode and beaconless modes have been investigated with Guaranteed Time Slots (GTS) and virtual Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) respectively. The methodology plays a key role towards reserving bandwidth for latency critical applications; eliminate collisions and medium access delays. Moreover analysis ad-hoc routing protocols including two proactive (OLSR, DSDV) and one reactive (AODV) is also presented. The results shows that the proposed scheme guarantees high packet delivery ratios while maintaining acceptable levels of latency requirements comparable with more complex and dedicatedly designed protocols in literature. © 2016 Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommuniocations","FANETs; IEEE 802.15.4; Latency; Multicluster; Reliability",,,,,,,,"Bekmezci, İ., Sahingoz, O.K., Temel, Ş., Flying Ad-Hoc Networks (FANETs) (2013) Surv.

We aim to find the optimal transmition power for the FD transmitters such that the network-wide capacity is maximized. Based on the high Signal-to-Interference-Plus-Noise Ratio (SINR) approximation and a more general approximation method for logarithm functions, we develop effective distributed power control algorithms with the dual decomposition approach. We also extend the work to the general FD network scenario, which can be decomposed into subproblems of isolated nodes, paths, and cycles. The corresponding power control problem is then be solved with the distributed algorithm. The proposed algorithms are validated with simulation studies. © 2017 Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommuniocations","Distributed algorithm; Dual decomposition; Full duplex transmission; Power control",,,,,,,,"Wang, Y., Mao, S., Distributed power control in full duplex wireless networks (2015), pp. 1165-1170. , Proceedings IEEE WCNC 2015, New Orleans, LA, Mar. pp; Saraydar, C.U., Mandayam, N.B., Goodman, D., Efficient power control via pricing in wireless data networks (2002) IEEE Trans.

The Dynamic Power Management (DPM) technique is a way of controlling and saving the energy usage in a sensor node. Previously, researchers have proposed lifetime improving stochastic models for wireless sensor networks and limited work has been done focusing on the wireless sensor node. This paper proposes an analyser based Semi-Markov model for DPM in the event-driven sensor node. The power consumption comparison with previously proposed models without this analyser shows the analyser significant contributes to lifetime improvement. The improved model is more power efficient, presents how the DPM model observes the input event arrival and power states of the sensor node components, and then dynamically manages the power consumption of the overall system. Further, to observe the effect of event arrival, missed events, waiting time, processor utilization on the power consumption and lifetime, the proposed DPM system with the single server queuing model is developed. © 2017 Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommuniocations","Analyser based; Dynamic power management; Event arrival; Event driven; Lifetime improvement; Power analysis; Power consumption; Simulation model; Stochastic model; Wireless sensor node",,,,,,,,"Talukder, A., Bhatt, R., Sheikh, T., Pidva, R., Chandramouli, L., Monacos, S., Dynamic control and power management algorithm for continuous wireless monitoring in sensor networks (2004), in: Proceedings of the 29th Annual IEEE International Conference on Local Computer Networks, pp. 498–505, 16-18 Nov; Munir, A., Gordon-Ross, A., An MDP-based dynamic optimization methodology for wireless sensor networks (2012) IEEE Trans.

Caching in the core network has proven to reduce power usage for various video services in current optical networks. This paper investigates whether video caching will still remain power efficient in future optical networks. The study compares the power consumption of caching in a current IP over WDM core network to a future network. The study considers a number of features to exemplify future networks. Future optical networks are considered where: (1) network devices consume less power, (2) network devices have sleep-mode capabilities, (3) IP over WDM implements lightpath bypass, and (4) the demand for video content significantly increases and high definition video dominates. Results show that video caching in future optical networks saves up to 42% of power consumption even when the power consumption of transport reduces. These results suggest that video caching is expected to remain a green option in video services in the future Internet. © 2016 Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommuniocations","Core optical networks; High Definition video; IP over WDM; Lightpath bypass; Sleep-mode capable equipment",,,,,,,,"http://www.internetworldstats.com/stats.htm, [Online].

In the proposed scheme, a number of mobile devices form a group if these devices move together for a long time duration. Although call delivery or call generation are performed individually, hand-off is performed in a group. Dynamic group formation, group division and group merging methods are proposed in this paper. From the simulation results it is demonstrated that approximately 75%, 65% and 90% reduction in power, cost and latency consumption can be obtained respectively using group hand-off management. Thus the proposed scheme is referred as green, economic and fast hand-off strategy. In this paper instead of a macrocell network, a microcell-femtocell network is considered as the transmission power of a microcell or a femtocell base station is much less than a macrocell base station. Simulation results present that the microcell-femtocell network achieves approximately 25–55% and 35–55% reduction in power transmission, and 50–65% and 15–45% reduction in path loss than only a macrocell network and macrocell-femtocell network respectively.

We address the problem of providing a hybrid protection approach on elastic optical networks under contiguity and continuity of available spectrum constraints. Two main hypotheses are used in this paper for backup paths computation. In the first case, it is assumed that backup paths resources are dedicated. In the second case, the assumption is that backup paths resources are available shared resources. The objective of the study is to minimize spectrum utilization to reduce blocking probability on a network. For this purpose, an efficient survivable Hybrid Protection Lightpath (HybPL) algorithm is proposed for providing shared or dedicated backup path protection based on the efficient energy calculation and resource availability. Traditional First-Fit and Best-Fit schemes are employed to search and assign the available spectrum resources. The simulation results show that HybPL presents better performance in terms of blocking probability, compared with the Minimum Resources Utilization Dedicated Protection (MRU-DP) algorithm which offers better performance than the Dedicated Protection (DP) algorithm. © 2016 Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommuniocations","Backup shared resources; Efficient energy cost; Elastic Optical Networks; Hybrid protection; Minimum resource utilization; Modulation format",,,,,,,,"Jinno, M., Takara, H., Kozicki, B., Tsukishima, Y., Yoshimatsu, T., Kobayashi, T., Miyamoto, Y., Matsuoka, S., Demonstration of Novel Spectrum-Efficient Elastic Optical Path Network with Per-Channel Variable Capacity of 40 Gb/s to Over 400 Gb/s (2008), ECOC 2008, Brussels, Belgium, vol. 7–49, 21–25 September; Jinno, M., Takara, H., Kozicki, B., Tsukishima, Y., Sone, Y., Matsuoka, S., Spectrum-efficient and scalable elastic optical path network: architecture, benefits, and enabling technologies (2009) IEEE Commun.

Device-to-Device (D2D) technology enables new service opportunities, and provides high throughput and reliable communication while reducing the base station load. For better total performance, short-range D2D links and cellular links share the same radio resource and the management of interference becomes a crucial task. Here we argue that single-hop D2D technology can be used to further improve cellular networks performance if the key D2D radio resource management algorithms are suitably extended to support multi-hop D2D communications. Aiming to establish a new paradigm for the analysis and design of multi-hop D2D communications, We propose a radio resource allocation for multi-hop D2D routes based on interference avoidance approach in LTE-A networks. On top of that, we investigate the outage probability of D2D communication. We first introduce a new definition of outage probability by considering the maximum distance to be allowable for single-hop transmission. Then we study and analyze the outage performance of a multi-hop D2D route. We derive the general closed form expression of outage probability of the multi-hop D2D routes. The results demonstrate that the D2D radio, sharing the same resources as the cellular network, provide higher capacity compared to pure cellular communication where all the data is transmitted through the base station. They also demonstrate that the new method of calculation of D2D multi hop outage probability has better performance than classical method defined in the literature. © 2016 Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommuniocations","D2D; Interference avoidance; LTE-A; Multi-hop; Outage probability",,,,,,,,"Asadi, A., Wang, Q., Mancus, V., A survey on device-to-device communication in cellular networks IEEE Communications Surveys Tutorials (2014); Hakola, S., Chen, T., Device-to-device communication in cellular network, performance analysis of optimal and practical communication mode selection (2010) Proceedings of IEEE WCNC; Melki, L., Najeh, S., Besbes, H., Subcarrier and bit allocation scheme for d2d communication based on ofdma cellular networks (2014) Proceedings of IEEE IWCMC; Liu, Y., Tamma, B.R., Manoj, B.S., Rao, R., On cognitive network channel selection and the impact of transport layer performance (2010) Proceedings of IEEE GLOBECOM; Feng, M., Mao, S., Jiang, T., (2015), Joint duplex mode selection, channel allocation, and power control for full-duplex cognitive femtocell networks, Elsevier.

This paper studies DSRC Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) performance in truck platooning scenarios through real-world experiments. Commercial DSRC equipments and semi-trailer trucks are used in this study. We mount one DSRC antenna on each side of the truck. One set of dynamic tests and a few sets of static tests are conducted to explore DSRC behaviors under different situations. From the test results, we verified some of our speculations. For example, hilly roads can affect delivery ratio and antennas mounted on opposite sides of a truck can suffer from low delivery ratio at curved roads. In addition, we also found that antennas can sometimes suffer from low delivery ratio even when the trucks are on straight roads, possibly due to reflections from the nearby terrain. Fortunately, the delivery ratio can be greatly improved by using the two side antennas alternately. © 2016 Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommuniocations","Delivery ratio; DSRC V2V performance; Empirical study; Truck platooning",,,,,,"Federal Highway Administration, FHWA: DTFH61-13-H-00019","This research is supported in part by the U.S. Federal Highway Administration, under Contract No. DTFH61-13-H-00019, entitled Heavy Truck Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control: Evaluation, Testing, and Stakeholder Engagement for Near Term Deployment.","http://www.aradasystems.com/products/, Locomate products, URL, 〈〉; (2012), http://www.densomedia-na.com/press_kits/naias2012/technology/Jan_9_V2X_Brochure_final%20.pdf, Denso connected vehicle technology 1, URL, 〈〉; http://www.unex.com.tw/v2x, Unex: V2x and v2x fusion technology, URL, 〈〉; Kenney, J., Dedicated short-range communications (dsrc) standards in the united states (2011) Proc.

The design of a new method to detect moving targets through non-transparent surfaces could greatly aid the safety of hazardous military and government operations. In this paper, we develop through-wall virtual imaging using Wi-Fi enabled software defined radio to see moving objects and their relative locations. We use LabVIEW and NI Universal Software Radio Peripheral (NI USRP2921 radios with Ettus Research LP0965 directive antennas) devices to detect moving objects behind walls by sending and receiving a signal with respect to the USRP's location. Based on the signal-to-interference ratio of our signal (rather than the traditional signal-to-noise method), we could determine the target object behind the wall. The two major applications for this project are: detecting an active shooter that is standing on the other side of the wall and detecting abnormalities in the human body such as breast cancer with more sensitive antennas. Likewise, firefighters, law enforcement officers, and military men would find more practical purposes for the use of this system in their fields.

The optimal detector becomes prohibitively complex. The approximate message passing (AMP) algorithm, designed for compressed sensing, has attracted researchers to counter this problem due to its reduced complexity with a large system limit. For this reason the AMP algorithm has been used for detection in massive MIMO systems. In this paper, we focus on implementing this algorithm in a fixed-point format. To obtain an implementation friendly architecture, we propose approximations for the mean and variance estimation functions within the algorithm. These estimation functions are obtained using the log-sum approximation, then taking the exponent of the result. The log-sum approximation is obtained by the Jacobian logarithm with a correction function. We also provide a modification of the correction function for the approximations that best suits our case. We then transform the algorithm with the approximated functions to fixed-point and provide a BER performance for the algorithm with the variables set to 16-bit word lengths using the hybrid “ScaledDouble” data types. © 2016 Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommuniocations","AMP; Log-sum approximation",,,,,,,,"Jeon, C., Ghods, R., Maleki, A., Studer, C., Optimality of large mimo detection via approximate message passing (2015), arXiv: 1510.06095v1 [cs.IT], October; Wu, S., Kuang, L., Ni, Z., Lu, J., David Huang, D., Guo, Q., Low complexity iterative detection for large-scale multiuser mimo-ofdm systems using approximate message passing (2014) IEEE J.

In this context, this paper proposes a novel concept of Universal Intelligent Small Cell (UnISCell) for enabling the densification of the next generation of cellular networks. The proposed novel concept envisions an integrated platform of providing a strong linkage between different stakeholders such as street lighting networks, landline telephone networks and future wireless networks, and is universal in nature being independent of the operating frequency bands and traffic types. The main motivating factors for the proposed small cell concept are the need of public infrastructure re-engineering, and the recent advances in several enabling technologies. First, we highlight the main concepts of the proposed UnISCell platform. Subsequently, we present two deployment scenarios for the proposed UnISCell concept considering infrastructure sharing and service sharing as important aspects. We then describe the key future technologies for enabling the proposed UnISCell concept and present a use case example with the help of numerical results.

To subdue the channel propagation characteristics in this band, high dimensional antenna arrays need to be deployed at both the base station (BS) and mobile sets (MS). Unlike the conventional MIMO systems, Millimeter-wave (mmW) systems lay away to employ the power predatory equipment such as ADC or RF chain in each branch of MIMO system because of hardware constraints. Such systems leverage to the hybrid precoding (combining) architecture for downlink deployment. Because there is a large array at the transceiver, it is impossible to estimate the channel by conventional methods. This paper develops a new algorithm to estimate the mmW channel by exploiting the sparse nature of the channel. The main contribution is the representation of a sparse channel model and the exploitation of a modified approach based on Multiple Measurement Vector (MMV) greedy sparse framework and subspace method of Multiple Signal Classification (MUSIC) which work together to recover the indices of non-zero elements of an unknown channel matrix when the rank of the channel matrix is defected. In practical rank-defective channels, MUSIC fails, and we need to propose new extended MUSIC approaches based on subspace enhancement to compensate the limitation of MUSIC. Simulation results indicate that our proposed extended MUSIC algorithms will have proper performances and moderate computational speeds, and that they are even able to work in channels with an unknown sparsity level. © 2016 Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommuniocations","Millimeter wave communications; Multiple measurement vectors (MMV); Rank-defective; Sparse channel estimation; Subspace enhancement",,,,,,,,"Rappaport, T.S., Heath, R.W., Jr, Daniels, R.C., Murdock, J.N., Millimeter Wave Wireless Communications (2014), Pearson Education; Wang, P., Li, Y., Song, L., Vucetic, B., Multi-gigabit millimeter wave wireless communications for 5G: from fixed access to cellular networks (2015) Commun.

Since the fusion center (FC) has to handle a large set of data, a cluster based approach, specifically fuzzy c-means clustering (FCM), has been extensively used in energy detection based cooperative spectrum sensing (CSS). However, the performance of FCM degrades at low signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) and in the presence of multiple PUs as energy data patterns at the FC are often found to be non-spherical i.e. overlapping. To address the problem, this work explores the scope of kernel fuzzy c-means (KFCM) on energy detection based CSS through the projection of non-linear input data to a high dimensional feature space. Extensive simulation results are shown to highlight the improved detection of multiple PUs at low SNR with low energy consumption. An improvement in the detection probability by ∼6.78% and ∼6.96% at −15 dBW and −20 dBW, respectively, is achieved over the existing FCM method. © 2016 Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommuniocations","Cooperative spectrum sensing; Energy detection; Kernel fuzzy c-means; Multiple PU detection",,,,,,,,"(2002), Spectrum policy task force, Report ET Docket No. 02-135; (2007), Digital Dividend Review, A Statement on Our Approach Towards Awarding the Digital Dividend; Mitola, J., Cognitive radio: an integrated agent architecture for software defined radio (Ph.D. dissertation) (2000), Computer Communication System Laboratory, Department of Teleinformatics, Royal Institute of Technology (KTH), Stockholm, Sweden, May; Zou, Y., Yao, Y.-D., Zheng, B., Cognitive transmissions with multiple relays in cognitive radio networks (2011) IEEE Trans.

However, densely deployed femtocells in urban area also give rise to intra-tier interference and cross-tier issue that should be addressed properly in order to acquire the expected performance gain. In this paper, we propose an interference management scheme based on joint clustering and resource allocation for two-tier Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM)-based femtocell networks. We formulate an optimization task with the objective of maximizing the sum throughput of the femtocell users (FUs) under the consideration of intra-tier interference mitigation, while controlling the interference to the macrocell user (MU) under its bearable threshold. The formulation problem is addressed by a two-stage procedure: femtocells clustering and resource allocation. First, disjoint femtocell clusters with dynamic sizes and numbers are generated to minimize intra-tier interference. Then each cluster is taken as a resource allocation unit to share all subchannels, followed by a fast algorithm to distribute power among these subchannels. Simulation results show that our proposed schemes can improve the throughput of the FUs with acceptable complexity. © 2016 Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommuniocations","Clustering; Femtocell networks; Interference management",,,,,,,,"Cheung, W.C., Quek, T., Kountouris, M., Throughput optimization, spectrum allocation, and access control in two-tier femtocell networks (2012) IEEE J.

However, the achievable performance of IA in cellular networks depends on the quality of channel state information (CSI) and how effective IA is in practical settings is not known. This paper studies the use of IA to mitigate inter-cell interference of cellular networks under imperfect CSI conditions.

User equipments (UEs) in the overlapped area of multiple cells might be able to access various base stations (BSs) of the cells, resulting in various transmission performances due to cell heterogeneity. Hence, designing optimal cell selection scheme is of particular importance for it may affect user quality of service (QoS) and network performance significantly. In this paper, we jointly consider cell selection and transmit power allocation problem in a HetNet consisting of multiple cells. For a single UE case, we formulate the energy efficiency of the UE, and propose an energy efficient optimization scheme which selects the optimal cell corresponding to the maximum energy efficiency of the UE. The problem is then extended to multiple UEs case. To achieve joint performance optimization of all the UEs, we formulate an optimization problem with the objective of maximizing the sum energy efficiency of UEs subject to QoS and power constraints. The formulated nonlinear fractional optimization problem is equivalently transformed into two subproblems, i.e., power allocation subproblem of each UE-cell pair, and cell selection subproblem of UEs. The two subproblems are solved respectively through applying Lagrange dual method and Kuhn–Munkres (K-M) algorithm. Numerical results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed algorithm. © 2016 Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommuniocations","Cellular network; Energy efficiency; HetNets; Kuhn–Munkres; Lagrange",,,,,,,,"Ying, L.L., Chuah, T.C., Loo, J., Recent advances in radio resource management for heterogeneous LTE/LTE-A networks (2014) IEEE Commun.

By exploiting MIMO in cooperative DSA, SUs can relay the primary traffic and send their own data at the same time, which greatly improves the performance of both PUs and SUs when compared to the non-MIMO time-division spectrum sharing schemes. Especially, we focus on the relay selection optimization problem among multiple PUs and multiple SUs. The network-wide cooperation and competition are formulated as a bargaining game, and an algorithm is developed to derive the optimal PU-SU relay assignment and resource allocation. Evaluation results show that both primary and secondary users achieve significant utility gains with the proposed framework, which gives all of them incentive for cooperation. © 2016 Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommuniocations","Bargaining game; Cooperative spectrum sharing; Dynamic spectrum access; MIMO; Relay selection",,,,,,,,"Song, M., Xin, C., Zhao, Y., Chen, X., Dynamic spectrum access: from cognitive radio to network radio (2012) IEEE Wirel.

We consider m realtime jobs with various lengths and n machines with different computational speeds and costs. Each job has a deadline to be met, and the profit of processing a packet of a job differs from other jobs. Moreover, considered deadlines are either hard or soft and a penalty is applied if a deadline is missed where the penalty is considered as an exponential function of time. The scheduling problem has been formulated as a mixed integer non-linear programming problem whose objective is to maximize net-profit. The formulated problem is computationally hard and not solvable in deterministic polynomial time. This research work proposes an algorithm named the Tube-tap algorithm as a solution to this scheduling optimization problem. Extensive simulation shows that the proposed algorithm outperforms existing solutions in terms of maximizing net-profit and preserving deadlines. © 2016 Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommuniocations","EDD; Job-shop scheduling problems; JSP; LPT; LS; MINLP; SPT; Tube-tap",,,,,,,,"Larranaga, P., Lozano, J.A., (2002) Estimation of Distribution Algorithms: A New Tool for Evolutionary Computation, 2. , Springer Science & Business Media; Chakraborty, U.K., (2009) Computational Intelligence in Flow Shop and Job Shop Scheduling, Studies in Computational Intelligence, 230. , Springer-Verlag Berlin, Heidelberg; Brandt, S.A., Banachowski, S., Lin, C., Bisson, T., Dynamic integrated scheduling of hard real-time, soft real-time, and non-real-time processes (2003) 24th IEEE Real-Time Systems Symposium, 2003.

In this paper, we investigate how to perform SBR using MapReduce (SBRMR), which is an inference framework for data-intensive applications over clusters of computers. To combine the similarities from the individual machines, a mixed integer optimization problem is formulated to filter the priority reference cases. Besides, a resilient mapping mechanism is employed using a quadratic optimization model for weighting the attributes and making the neighborhoods in the same class compact, hence improving the inference capacity. Our experiments on classifying the medical cases demonstrate that SBRMR has approximately 4.1% improvement in classification accuracy over SBR, which suggests that SBRMR is an efficient and resilient similarity-based inference approach. © 2016 Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommuniocations",,,,,,,"Chongqing Municipal Education Commission, CQMEC: KJ1600401

In order to improve the prediction accuracy of the network security situation, we build a network security situation prediction model based on Wavelet Neural Network (WNN) with optimized parameters by the Improved Niche Genetic Algorithm (INGA). The proposed model adopts WNN which has strong nonlinear ability and fault-tolerance performance. Also, the parameters for WNN are optimized through the adaptive genetic algorithm (GA) so that WNN searches more effectively. Considering the problem that the adaptive GA converges slowly and easily turns to the premature problem, we introduce a novel niche technology with a dynamic fuzzy clustering and elimination mechanism to solve the premature convergence of the GA. Our final simulation results show that the proposed INGA-WNN prediction model is more reliable and effective, and it achieves faster convergence-speed and higher prediction accuracy than the Genetic Algorithm-Wavelet Neural Network (GA-WNN), Genetic Algorithm-Back Propagation Neural Network (GA-BPNN) and WNN. © 2016 Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommuniocations","Adaptive genetic algorithm; INGA; Network security; Situation prediction; WNN",,,,,,"Chongqing Municipal Education Commission, CQMEC: KJ1400405

Targeting the privacy requirements of large-scale WSNs and focusing on the energy-efficient collection of big sensor data, a Scalable Privacy-preserving Big Data Aggregation (Sca-PBDA) method is proposed in this paper. Firstly, according to the pre-established gradient topology structure, sensor nodes in the network are divided into clusters. Secondly, sensor data is modified by each node according to the privacy-preserving configuration message received from the sink. Subsequently, intra- and inter-cluster data aggregation is employed during the big sensor data reporting phase to reduce energy consumption. Lastly, aggregated results are recovered by the sink to complete the privacy-preserving big data aggregation. Simulation results validate the efficacy and scalability of Sca-PBDA and show that the big sensor data generated by large-scale WSNs is efficiently aggregated to reduce network resource consumption and the sensor data privacy is effectively protected to meet the ever-growing application requirements. © 2016 Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommuniocations","Big sensor data; Data aggregation; Gradient-based clustering; Privacy-preserving method",,,,,,,,"Takaishi, D., Nishiyama, H., Kato, N., Toward energy efficient big data gathering in densely distributed sensor networks (2014) IEEE Trans.

By taking the advantages of the fault-tolerant distributed file system called the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) and high-performance parallel data processing engine called MapReduce programming paradigm, MS-SHM-Hadoop features include high scalability and robustness in data ingestion, fusion, processing, retrieval, and analytics. MS-SHM-Hadoop is a multi-scale reliability analysis framework, which ranges from nationwide bridge-surveys, global structural integrity analysis, and structural component reliability analysis. This Nationwide bridge survey uses deep-learning techniques to evaluate the bridge serviceability according to real-time sensory data or archived bridge-related data such as traffic status, weather conditions and bridge structural configuration. The global structural integrity analysis of a targeted bridge is made by processing and analyzing the measured vibration signals incurred by external loads such as wind and traffic flow. Component-wise reliability analysis is also enabled by the deep learning technique, where the input data is derived from the measured structural load effects, hyper-spectral images, and moisture measurement of the structural components. As one of its major contributions, this work employs a Bayesian network to formulate the integral serviceability of a bridge according to its components serviceability and inter-component correlations. Here the inter-component correlations are jointly specified using a statistics-oriented machine learning method (e.g., association rule learning) or structural mechanics modeling and simulation. © 2016 Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommuniocations","Bridge; Deep learning; Hadoop Ecosystem; Multi-scale; Reliability analysis; Serviceability",,,,,,,,"Xu, Y.L., Xia, Y., Structural Health Monitoring of Long-span Suspension Bridges (2011), CRC Press 978-0203839669; Kim, S., Pakzad, S., Culler, D., Demmel, J., Fenves, G., Glaser, S., Turon, M., Health monitoring of civil infrastructures using wireless sensor networks (2007) Proceedings of 6th International Symposium on Information Processing in Sensor Networks, Cambridge, MA, USA, , http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/IPSN.2007.4379685; Jang, S., Jo, H., Cho, S., Structural health monitoring of a cable-stayed bridge using smart sensor technology: deployment and evaluation (2010) Smart Struct.

While speaking, people often use heavy tonal stress and certain gestural clues like rolling of the eyes, hand movement, etc. to reveal sarcastic. In the textual data, these tonal and gestural clues are missing, making sarcasm detection very difficult for an average human. Due to these challenges, researchers show interest in sarcasm detection of social media text, especially in tweets. Rapid growth of tweets in volume and its analysis pose major challenges. In this paper, we proposed a Hadoop based framework that captures real time tweets and processes it with a set of algorithms which identifies sarcastic sentiment effectively. We observe that the elapse time for analyzing and processing under Hadoop based framework significantly outperforms the conventional methods and is more suited for real time streaming tweets. © 2016 Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommuniocations","Big data; Flume; Hadoop; Hive; MapReduce; Sarcasm; Sentiment; Tweets",,,,,,,,"Chaffey, D., http://www.smartinsights.com/social-media-marketing/social-media-strategy/new-global-social-media-research/, Global Social Media Research Summary 2016.

The Basis Expansion Model (BEM) is adopted to fit the fast time-varying channel in a high-speed railway communication scenario. The channel impulse response is modeled as the sum of basis functions multiplied by different coefficients. The optimal coefficients are obtained by theoretical analysis. Simulation results show that a Generalized Complex-Exponential BEM (GCE-BEM) outperforms a Complex-Exponential BEM (CE-BEM) and a polynomial BEM in terms of Mean Squared Error (MSE). Besides, the MSE of the CE-BEM decreases gradually as the number of basis functions increases. The GCE-BEM has a satisfactory performance with the serious fading channel. © 2016 Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommuniocations","Basis expansion model; Channel estimation; LTE-R",,,,,,"Natural Science Foundation of Fujian Province: 2015J05122

The two main protocol stacks, the WAVE standards proposed by the IEEE in the United States and the ETSI ITS-G5 in Europe, reserved 10 MHz wide channels in the 5.9 GHz spectrum band. Despite the exclusive use of these frequencies for vehicular communication purposes, there are still cross channel interference problems that have been widely reported in the literature. In order to mitigate these issues, this paper presents the design of a two-stage FIR low-pass filter, targeting the integration with a digital baseband receiver chain of a custom vehicular communications platform. The filter was tested, evaluated and optimized, with the simulation results proving the effectiveness of the proposed method and the low delay introduced in the overall operation of the receiver chain. © 2016 Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommuniocations","Adjacent Channel Interference; Digital Hardware Design; Filter design; Intelligent transportation systems; Multi-rate systems; Vehicular communications",,,,,,"Seventh Framework Programme, FP7

Specifically developing countries require a low cost and reliable network with efficient protocols. The most challenging concern of Body Area Network (BAN) is heterogeneity, which requires fairness with reliability among all the network nodes. Solutions proposed for these networks either do not provide fair packet transmission or consume high energy and introduce delays. In this paper, we propose a cross layer protocol for healthcare applications meeting the requirements and challenges of the heterogeneous BAN. The protocol is also feasible for developing countries as it can be implemented over existing wireless infrastructure and provides high network reliability with energy efficiency through cooperation and adaptability. Results show that the proposed scheme improves reliability, throughput, Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR), and energy consumption for scalable and mobile networks over conventional BAN protocols. © 2015 The Authors","Cooperative AODV (Ad-hoc On-demand Distance Vector) routing; Cross layer adaptability; Data aggregation; Heterogeneous network; Wireless BAN communication",,,,,,,,"Albabtain, A.F., Almulhim, D.A., Yunus, F., Househ, M.S., The role of mobile health in the developing world: a review of current knowledge and future trends (2014) J.

Despite the various expected benefits of this concept, significant drawbacks were addressed in the open literature. One of WDC key challenges is the impact of wireless channel quality on the load of distributed computations. Therefore, this research investigates the wireless channel impact on WDC performance when the latter is applied to spectrum sensing in cognitive radio (CR) technology. However, a trade-off is found between accuracy and computational complexity in spectrum sensing approaches. Increasing these approaches accuracy is accompanied by an increase in computational complexity. This results in greater power consumption and processing time. A novel WDC scheme for cyclostationary feature detection spectrum sensing approach is proposed in this paper and thoroughly investigated. The benefits of the proposed scheme are firstly presented. Then, the impact of the wireless channel of the proposed scheme is addressed considering two scenarios. In the first scenario, workload matrices are distributed over the wireless channel. Then, a fusion center combines these matrices in order to make a decision. Meanwhile, in the second scenario, local decisions are made by CRs, then, only a binary flag is sent to the fusion center. © 2015 The Authors","Cognitive radio; Cyclostationary feature detection; FFT time smoothing algorithms; Spectrum sensing; Wireless distributed computing",,,,,,"Ministry of Higher Education, Malaysia, MOHE: FRGS13-073-0314","This work is supported in part by the Malaysian Ministry of higher education (MOHE) under Grant FRGS13-073-0314.","Kim, S., Lee, S., Link capacity-energy aware WDC for network lifetime maximization (2015) Mobile Comput., IEEE Trans., 14 (8), pp. 1615-1628. , Aug. 1; Chen, J., Wang, W., A novel execution mode selection scheme for wireless computing (2015) Int.

Depth images are pre-processed by a median filter both for background and target. The silhouette of moving individual in depth images is achieved by a subtraction method for background frames. The depth images are converted to disparity map, which is obtained by the horizontal and vertical projection histogram statistics. The initial floor plane information is obtained by V disparity map, and the floor plane equation is estimated by the least square method. Shape information of human subject in depth images is analyzed by a set of moment functions. Coefficients of ellipses are calculated to determine the direction of individual. The centroids of the human body are calculated and the angle between the human body and the floor plane is calculated. When both the distance from the centroids of the human body to the floor plane and the angle between the human body and the floor plane are lower than some thresholds, fall incident will be detected. Experiments with different falling direction are performed. Experimental results show that the proposed method can detect fall incidents effectively. © 2015 The Authors","Depth images; Fall detection; Moment function; Shape analysis",,,,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC: 201003280, 61005015","This work is financially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (61005015), the third National Post-Doctoral Special Foundation of China (201003280), and 2011 Shanghai city young teachers? subsidy scheme.

Sensor node die-out has a significant impact on the topology of a tactical WSN. This is problematic for military applications where situational data is critical to tactical decision making. To increase the amount of time all sensor nodes remain active within the network and to control the network topology tactically, energy efficient routing mechanisms must be employed. In this paper, we aim to provide realistic insights on the practical advantages and disadvantages of using established routing techniques for tactical WSNs. We investigate the following established routing algorithms: direct routing, minimum transmission energy (MTE), Low Energy Adaptive Cluster Head routing (LEACH), and zone clustering. Based on the node die out statistics observed with these algorithms and the topological impact the node die outs have on the network, we develop a novel, energy efficient zone clustering algorithm called EZone. Via extensive simulations using MATLAB, we analyze the effectiveness of these algorithms on network performance for single and multiple gateway scenarios and show that the EZone algorithm tactically controls the topology of the network, thereby maintaining significant service area coverage when compared to the other routing algorithms. © 2016 The Authors","Energy efficiency; Routing; Topology control; Wireless sensor networks; Zones",,,,,,,,"Heinzelman, W.R., Chandrakasan, A., Balakrishnan, H., Energy-efficient communication protocol for wireless microsensor networks (2000) Proceedings of Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences (HICSS), pp. 1-10; Heinzelman, W.R., Chandrakasan, A., Balakrishnan, H., An application specific protocol architecture for wireless microsensor networks (2002) IEEE Trans.

In this paper, we consider available bandwidth as a dynamic parameter to select the network in heterogeneous environments. A bootstrap approximation based technique is firstly utilized to estimate the available bandwidth and compare it with hidden Markov model based estimation to check its accuracy. It is then used for the selection of the best suitable network in the heterogeneous environment consisting of 2G and 3G standards based wireless networks. The proposed algorithm is implemented in temporal and spatial domains to check its robustness. The numerical results show that the proposed algorithm gives improved performance in terms of estimation error (less than 15%), overhead (varies from 0.45% to 72.91%) and reliability (approx. 99%)as compared to the existing algorithm. © 2016 The Authors","2G; 3G; Available bandwidth; Bootstrap approximation; Heterogeneous networks",,,,,,,,"Brusilovsky, A., William Varney, D., Selection of networks between WLAN and 2G/3G networks based on user and provider preferences (2006), Oct 3; Gharsellaoui, A., Chahine, M.K., Optimizing access point selection in wireless local area network (2011), pp. 47-52. , in Proceedings of the International Conference on Communications and Information Technology (ICCIT), Aqaba, 29th–31st March, pp; Hussain, I., Khattak, R., Handover between 2G, 3G and WLANs,Electrical and Information Technology (2009), Department of Lund University, Study project by master student in wireless communication in; Jain, M., Dovrolis, C., End-to-end available bandwidth: measurement methodology, dynamics, and relation with tcp throughput (2003) IEEE/ACM Trans.

The delivery quantity, the production quantity, and the inventory are changing according to various unexpected events. Then the prediction of a production inventory is required to cope with such irregular fluctuations. This paper considers a production adjustment method for an automobile parts production process by using a dynamic Bayesian network. All factors that may influence the production quantity, the delivery quantity, and the inventory quantity will be handled. This study also provides a production schedule algorithm that sequentially adjusts the production schedule in order to guarantee that all deadlines are met. Furthermore, an adjusting rule for the production quantities is provided in order to maintain guaranteed delivery. © 2015 The Authors","Dynamic Bayesian Network; Graphical modeling; Probabilistic distribution; Production Adjusting Method",,,,,,,,"Shiina, T., Birge., J.R., Multistage stochastic programming model for electric power capacity expansion problem (2003) Jpn.

A CCD camera fixed on the top of the sorting system is used to obtain the images of the gears on the conveyor belt. The gears׳ features including number of holes, number of teeth and color are extracted, which is used to categorize the gears. Photoelectric sensors are used to locate the gears׳ position and produce the trigger signals for pneumatic cylinders. The automatic gear sorting is achieved by using pneumatic actuators to push different gears into their corresponding storage boxes. The experimental results verify the validity and reliability of the proposed method and system. © 2015 The Authors","Automatic sorting system; Gear; Image processing; Monocular vision",,,,,,,,"Wang, X.Q., Fully automatic gear detection and classification system (2012) China Sci.

Three challenging issues have been focused during its development: (i) how human voice and robot visual information could be effectively deployed in the mapping and navigation process; (ii) how semantic names could combine with coordinate data in an online Grid-Semantic map; and (iii) how a localization–evaluate–relocalization method could be used in global localization based on modified maximum particle weight of the particle swarm.

It aims to foster the roboticists, architects, and designers towards realizing robot friendly social spaces. Contrary to conventional robotics competitions focusing on designing robots and its component technologies, robot inclusive spaces challenge adopts an interdisciplinary “design for robots” strategy to overcome the traditional research problem in real world deployments of social robots. In order to realize the RIS, various architectural elements must be adapted including: design principles for inclusive spaces, lighting schemes, furniture choices and arrangement, wall and floor surfaces, pathways among others.

At the same time, energy efficiency is always the top issue for the battery-based smart devices such as smart phone, tablets, etc. In this paper, an adaptive Forward Error Correction (FEC) coding and cooperative relayed image transmission system is proposed, through which both transmission quality and energy efficiency could be promised under complex mobile communication channel environment. There are four steps in the proposed scheme: (1) Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) and wavelet based Decomposition, (2) Pixel-Position (PP) information and Pixel-Value (PV) information split based unequal image resource allocation, (3) transmission through channel fading and AWGN communication environment, (4) multiple-relays and adaptive channel coding. Comparing to traditional methods, our proposed method is more practical to transmit high quality images through battery-limited smart phone platforms. © 2015 The Authors","Cooperative Diversity (CD); Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT); Embedded Zero Tree Wavelet (EZW); Forward Error Correction (FEC); Image compression",,,,,,,,"Shapiro, J.M., Embedded image coding using zerotrees of wavelet coefficients (1993) IEEE Trans., Signal Process., 41 (12), pp. 3445-3462; Wang, W.E.I., Peng, D., Wang, H., Energy-constrained distortion reduction optimization for wavelet-based coded image transmission in wireless sensor networks (2008) IEEE Trans.

To optimize the performance of standard WDM in a 40 Gbps four-channel transmission system, numerical simulations are carried out to compare three different dispersion compensation techniques (without compensation; periodic dispersion compensation at the front end; and dispensation compensation all at the end of the system by means of highly dispersed pulses) for chromatic dispersion on a terrestrial 40 Gbps system. Both the loss and dispersion of the transmission fiber are periodically compensated, since two dispersive elements are placed at the input and the output ends of a compensation period. Due to the interplay between dispersion, nonlinearity and signal power, and the effect of dispersion on the pulse evolution, the pulse compress can be optimized and the system performance can be improved to compare with the system with either pre- or post-dispersion compensation. On comparing pre- and post-compensation methods, it is found that the latter is superior to the former. Further performance optimization includes how to properly match the EDFA power and length of the fiber. © 2015 The Authors","Dispersion compensation; Dispersion slope; Optical fiber communication; Optical fiber dispersion",,,,,,,,"Sano, A., Miyamoto, Y., Kuwahara, S., Toba, H., A 40 Gb/s/ch transmission with SPM/XPM suppression through pre chirping and dispersion management (2000) J.

It depends on other strategies such as perimeter routing to find a detour path, which can be long and result in inefficiency of the routing protocol. In this paper, we propose a new approach called Intermediate Target based Geographic Routing (ITGR) to solve the long detour path problem. The basic idea is to use previous experience to determine the destination areas that are shaded by the holes. The novelty of the approach is that a single forwarding path can be used to determine a shaded area that may cover many destination nodes. We design an efficient method for the source to find out whether a destination node belongs to a shaded area. The source then selects an intermediate node as the tentative target and greedily forwards packets to it, which in turn forwards the packet to the final destination by greedy routing. ITGR can combine multiple shaded areas to improve the efficiency of representation and routing. We perform simulations and demonstrate that ITGR significantly reduces the routing path length, compared with existing geographic routing protocols. © 2015 The Authors",,,,,,,"Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, EERE

It has gained huge attention with respect to its implementation in wide variety of domains ranging from traffic safety to infotainment applications. However, IoV can also be extended to healthcare domain, where the patients can be provided healthcare services on-the-fly. We extend this novel concept in this paper and refer it as “Healthcare services on-the-fly”. The concept of game theory has been used among the vehicles to access the healthcare services while traveling. The vehicles act as players in the game and tend to form and split coalitions to access these services. Learning automata (LA) act as the players for interaction with the environment and take appropriate actions based on reward and penalty. Apart from this, Virtual Machine (VM) scheduling algorithm for efficient utilization of resources at cloud level has also been formulated. A stochastic reward net (SRN)-based model is used to represent the coalition formation and splitting with respect to availability of resources at cloud level. The performance of the proposed scheme is evaluated using various performance evaluation metrics. The results obtained prove the effectiveness of the proposed scheme in comparison to the best, first, and random fit schemes. © 2015 The Authors","Cloud repository; Internet of vehicles; Petri net; VM-scheduling",,,,,,,,"Gubbi, J., Buyya, R., Marusic, S., Palaniswami, M., Internet of Things (IoT): a vision, architectural elements, and future directions (2013) Future Gener.

Radio on Free Space Optics (RoFSO) provides a new approach to support various bandwidth-intensive wireless services in an optical wireless link. In an RoFSO system using wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM), it is possible to concurrently transmit multiple data streams consisting of various wireless services at very high rate. In this paper, we investigate the problem of optical power allocation under power budget and eye safety constraints for adaptive WDM transmission in RoFSO networks. We develop power allocation schemes for adaptive WDM transmissions to combat the effect of weather turbulence on RoFSO links. Simulation results show that WDM RoFSO can support high data rates even over long distance or under bad weather conditions with an adequate system design. © 2015 The Authors","Free space optics; Radio over free space optics; Wavelength-division multiplexing",,,,,,"National Science Foundation, NSF: CNS-1320664

A multi-objective resource allocation task is formulated to optimize the EE and the SE of the CR system simultaneously with the consideration of the mutual interference and the spectrum sensing errors. We first exploit the EE–SE relations and demonstrate that the EE is a quasiconcave function of the SE, based on which the Pareto optimal set of the multi-objective optimization problem is characterized. To find a unique globally optimal solution, we propose a unified EE–SE tradeoff metric to transform the multi-objective optimization problem into a single-objective one which has a D.C. (difference of two convex functions/sets) structure and yields a standard convex optimization problem. We derive a fast method to speed up the time-consuming computation by exploiting the structure of the convex problem. Simulation results validate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed algorithms, which can produce the unique globally optimal solution of the original multi-objective optimization problem. © 2015 The Authors","Cognitive radio; Energy efficiency; Multi-objective optimization; Spectrum efficiency",,,,,,,,"Facilitating Opportunities for Flexible, Efficient, and Reliable Spectrum Use Employing Cognitive Radio Technologies, FCC Report ET Docket 03-322; Haykin, S., Cognitive radio: brain-empowered wireless communications (2005) IEEE J.

Software-Defined Network (SDN) is a fundamental advancement in networking that enables network programmability. SDN and software-defined compute/storage systems form a Software-Defined Cloud Environment (SDCE) that may greatly facilitate composite network–compute service provisioning to Cloud users. Therefore, networking and computing systems need to be modeled and analyzed as composite service provisioning systems in order to obtain thorough understanding about service performance in SDCEs. In this paper, a novel approach for modeling composite network–compute service capabilities and a technique for evaluating composite network–compute service performance are developed. The analytic method proposed in this paper is general and agnostic to service implementation technologies; thus is applicable to a wide variety of network–compute services in SDCEs. The results obtained in this paper provide useful guidelines for federated control and management of networking and computing resources to achieve Cloud service performance guarantees. © 2015 The Authors","Cloud computing; Composite service provisioning; Performance analysis; Service modeling; Software-defined Cloud environment",,,,,,,,"Foster, I., Zhao, Y., Raicu, I., Lu, S., Cloud computing and Grid computing 360-degrees compared (2008), pp. 1-10. , Proceedings of the 2008 Grid Computing Environment Workshop, November, pp; Jackson, K.R., Muriki, K., Canon, S., Cholia, S., Shalf, J., Performance analysis of high performance computing applications on the Amazon Web services Cloud (2010), pp. 159-168. , Proceedings of the 2010 IEEE International Conference on Cloud Computing Technology and Science, November, pp; Wang, G., Ng, T.S.E., The impact of virtualization on network performance of Amazon EC2 data center (2010), pp. 1-9. , Proceedings of the IEEE INFOCOM2010, March, pp; (2013), https://www.opennetworking.org/sdn-resources/sdn-definition, Open Networking Foundation Software-Defined Networking (SDN) Definition, 〈〉; Li, C., Brech, B., Crowder, S., Dias, D., Franke, H., Hogstrom, M., Lindquist, D., Williams, M., Software-defined environments: an introduction (2014) IBM J.

They make use of detected visual features in the environment, the earth׳s magnetic field as well as using the hippocampus region of the brain to construct spatial maps of the environment. This is unlike present day UAVs that rely on GPS and radio/satellite communications with a ground station, both of which might not be available during a major disaster scenario such as a solar flare. In this paper, we take inspiration from the avian hippocampus and develop a preliminary model for estimating a terrain׳s morphology using visually detected features on the terrain. This could then be used to localise a portable micro-UAV during a demining task for humanitarian purposes in third world countries affected by buried land mines from previous wars.

For controlling rolling locomotion, a controller which can compensate energy loss with rolling locomotion of the hexapod robot is designed based on its dynamic model. The dynamic model describes the rolling locomotion which is limited to planar one by an assumption that the hexapod robot does not fall down while rolling and influences due to collision and contact with the ground, and it is applied for computing the mechanical energy of the hexapod robot and a plant for a numerical simulation. The numerical simulation of the rolling locomotion on the level ground verifies the effectiveness of the proposed controller. The simulation results show that the hexapod robot can perform the rolling locomotion with the proposed controller. In conclusion, it is shown that the proposed control approach is effective in achieving the rolling locomotion on the level ground. © 2015 The Authors",,,,,,,,,"Halme, A., Schonberg, T., Wang, Y., Motion control of a spherical mobile robot (1996), pp. 259-264. , 1996 Fourth International Workshop on Advanced Motion Control.

The deployment of an automated mobile base will help enhance the productivity of logistics tasks in the hospital, like collection and delivery. By improving such logistic tasks healthcare personal is able to focus on other tasks to serve the community better. Currently there are commercial solutions to deal with these logistic tasks, where a mobile base is able to move from one place to another in a structured environment like a hospital. In this paper, we present our approach to develop a cost effective mobile base to be used for delivery in healthcare amenities. The proposed approach is able to navigate among stations in the hospital by first creating a map of the floor and then indicating the location of these stations. This reduces the additional cost of drawing lines on the floor or to put laser markers and many of the commercial solutions required. In addition, the proposed solution is able to navigate while being safe for the people moving around and to the transported items. The paper discusses the design consideration of the system, the navigation and the battery management to ensure that the system is able to run autonomously without the need recharge often. © 2015 The Authors","Autonomous navigation; Delivery; Mobile base",,,,,,,,"Acosta Calderon, C.A., Mohan, R.E., Zhou, C., Elderly Tele-care in the Singapore Context (2011), in: Proceedings of the Workshop on Social Robotic Telepresence, International Conference on Human–Robot Interaction; (2014), World Robotics 2014 Service Robots, Technical Report, International Federation of Robotics, September; (2010), http://www.aboutsingaporeproperty.com/baby-boomers-want-retirement-homes/, Baby Boomers want Retirement Homes.

This paper reviews the deployment of these bio-signals in the state of art of control systems. The main aim of this paper is to describe the techniques used for (i) collecting EMG and EEG signals and diving these signals into segments (data acquisition and data segmentation stage), (ii) dividing the important data and removing redundant data from the EMG and EEG segments (feature extraction stage), and (iii) identifying categories from the relevant data obtained in the previous stage (classification stage). Furthermore, this paper presents a summary of applications controlled through these two bio-signals and some research challenges in the creation of these control systems.

An essential consideration in these reconfigurable legged robots is to attain stability in motion, at rest as well as while transforming from one configuration to another with the minimum number of legs as long as the full range of their walking patterns, resulting from the different gait cycles of their legs, is achieved. To this end, in this paper, we present a method for the generation of input joint trajectories to properly synchronize the movement of quadruped robots with reconfigurable legs. The approach is exemplified in a four-legged robot with reconfigurable Jansen legs capable of generating up to six useful different gait cycles. The proposed technique is validated through simulated results that show the platform׳s stability across its six feasible walking patterns and during gait transition phases, thus considerably extending the capabilities of the non-reconfigurable design. © 2015 The Authors","Jansen mechanism; Legged robot; Reconfigurable mechanism; Static stability; Walking platform",,,,,,,,"Kamimura, A., Kurokawa, H., Yoshida, E., Murata, S., Tomita, K., Kokaji, S., Automatic locomotion design and experiments for a modular robotic system (2005) IEEE/ASME Trans.

Such McSoC devices allow superior performance gains while side-stepping the power and heat dissipation limitations of clock frequency scaling. The main advantage lies in the exploitation of parallelism, distributively and massively. Consequently, the on-chip communication fabric becomes the performance determinant. To bridge the widening gap between computation requirements and communication efficiency faced by gigascale McSoCs in the upcoming billion-transistor era, a new on-chip communication system, dubbed Wireless Network-on-Chip (WiNoC), has been proposed by using the recently developed RF interconnect technology. With the high data-rate, low power and ultra-short range interconnection provided by UWB technology, the WiNoC design paradigm calls for effective solutions to overhaul the on-chip communication infrastructure of gigascale McSoCs. In this work, an irregular and reconfigurable WiNoC platform is proposed to tackle ever increasing complexity, density and heterogeneity challenges. A flexible RF infrastructure is established where RF nodes are properly distributed and IP cores are clustered. Consequently, a performance-cost effective topology is formed. A region-aided routing scheme is further deigned and implemented to realize loop-free, minimum path cost and high scalability for irregular WiNoC infrastructure. To implement the data transmission protocol, the RF microarchitecture of WiNoC is developed where the RF nodes are designed to fulfill the functions of distributed table routing, multi-channel arbitration, virtual output queuing, and distributed flow control. Our simulation studies based on synthetic traffics demonstrate the network efficiency and scalability of WiNoC. © 2015 The Authors","Microarchitecture design; Network-on-Chip; RF interconnect; Routing algorithm; Topology design",,,,,,,,"Havemann, R.H., Hutchby, J.A., High-performance interconnects: An integration overview (2001) Proc.

The cellular network is a time-slotted system with simultaneously transmission, in each time slot, a single user is scheduled to transmit messages to BS while the remaining users opportunistically receive information. Considering multiple users available in the cellular network, we present three multi-user scheduling schemes, namely the round-robin scheduling scheme as well as the suboptimal and optimal user scheduling schemes to improve the security of communication (from users to BS) against eavesdropping attacks. We only need to assume that the channel state information (CSI) of the main link spanning from users to BS is known in the suboptimal scheduling. On the contrary, the optimal scheduling is designed by assuming that the CSI of the main link and wiretap link (spanning from users to the eavesdropper) are available. We further carry out secrecy diversity analysis and show that the round-robin always achieves only one diversity order, whereas the suboptimal and optimal user scheduling schemes achieve the full diversity. In addition, numerical results illustrate that the optimal scheduling performs the best and the round-robin has the worst performance in terms of the secrecy outage probability. Last, as the number of users increases, the secrecy outage probabilities of the suboptimal and optimal scheduling schemes decrease significantly. © 2015 The Authors","Cochannel interference; Eavesdropping attack; Multi-user scheduling; Physical layer security; Secrecy diversity; Secrecy outage probability",,,,,,,,"Seong, H.K., Bang, C.J., Sung Dan, K., Effect of other-cell interference on multiuser diversity in cellular networks (2007), pp. 521-525. , IEEE ISCIT 2007, pp; Fragkiadakis, A.G., Tragos, E.Z., Askoxylakis, I.G., A survey on security threats and detection techniques in cognitive radio networks (2013) IEEE Commun.

Though traditional activity recognition methods have been demonstrated to be effective in previous work, they raise some concerns such as privacy, energy consumption and deployment cost. In recent years, a new activity recognition approach, which takes advantage of body attenuation and/or channel fading of wireless radio, has been proposed. Compared with traditional activity recognition methods, radio based methods utilize wireless transceivers in environments as infrastructure, exploit radio communication characters to achieve high recognition accuracy, reduce energy cost and preserve user׳s privacy. In this paper, we divide radio based methods into four categories: ZigBee radio based activity recognition, WiFi radio based activity recognition, RFID radio based activity recognition, and other radio based activity recognition. Some existing work in each category is introduced and reviewed in detail. Then, we compare some representative methods to show their advantages and disadvantages. At last, we point out some future research directions of this new research topic. © 2015 The Authors","Activity recognition; Radio; RFID; WiFi; Zigbee",,,,,,"China Scholarship Council, CSC

For such a scenario, all the existing approaches that can achieve full cooperative diversity order are based on antenna/relay selection, for which the difficulty in designing the beamforming lies in the fact that a single beamformer needs to serve two destinations. In this paper, a new full-cooperative diversity beamforming scheme that ensures that the relay signals are coherently combined at both destinations is proposed, and analytical results are provided to demonstrate the performance gains. Moreover, the impact of channel estimation error is also evaluated. Finally, numerical results are provided to verify the accuracy of the provided analytical results, and also to show that this proposed scheme can outperform existing schemes based on antenna selection. © 2015 The Authors","Amplify-and-forward; Beamforming; Cooperative diversity; Network coding; Outage probability; Two-way relay systems",,,,,,,,"Laneman, J.N., Tse, D.N.C., Wornell, G.W., Cooperative diversity in wireless networks: Efficient protocols and outage behavior (2004) IEEE Trans.

Existing geographic routing algorithms use perimeter routing strategies to find a long detour path when such a situation occurs. To avoid the long detour path, recent research focuses on detecting the hole in advance, then the nodes located on the boundary of the hole advertise the hole information to the nodes near the hole. Hence the long detour path can be avoided in future routing. We propose a heuristic hole detecting algorithm which identifies the hole easily and quickly and then propose a representation of hole no matter what the shape of the hole is. In addition, we quantitatively figure out the areas in the vicinity of the hole that need to be announced the hole information. With such information, a new routing scheme with two landmarks was developed. Simulation results illustrate that our approach can achieve better performance in terms of the average length and number of hops in routing paths. Simulation also shows that our approach introduces very small computational complexity. © 2015 The Authors","Geographic routing; Hole detection; Representation; Wireless sensor networks",,,,,,,,"Shen, J., Sen-Ching, S., Cheung, Layer depth denoising and completion for structured-light rgb-d cameras (2013) IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), IEEE, Portland, OR, USA, pp. 1187-1194; Shen, J., Po-Chang, S., Sen-ching Samson, C., Zhao, J., (2013) Virtual mirror rendering with stationary rgb-d cameras and stored 3-d background, Image Process., 22 (9), pp. 3433-3448; Shen, J., Anusha, R., Sen-ching Samson, C., Patel, R., Automatic content generation for video self modeling (2011), pp. 1-6. , in: IEEE International Conference on Multimedia and Expo (ICME), IEEE, Barcelona, Spain, pp; Yang, J., Fei, Z., Broadcasting with Prediction and Selective Forwarding in Vehicular Networks (2013) Int.

We first consider the case of a pair of channels, and develop optimum-achieving power control solutions. Then, for the case of multiple channels, we formulate joint duplex model selection, power control, and channel allocation as a mixed integer nonlinear problem (MINLP), and propose an iterative framework to solve it. The proposed iterative framework consists of a duplex mode selection scheme, a near-optimal distributed power control algorithm, and a greedy channel allocation algorithm. We prove the convergence of the proposed iterative framework as well as a lower bound for the greedy channel allocation algorithm. Numerical results show that the proposed schemes effectively improve the sum rate of FDCFNs. © 2015 The Authors","Channel allocation; Cognitive femtocell network; Full-duplex transmissions; Mode selection; Power control",,,,,,,,"Feng, M., Mao, S., Jiang, T., Duplex mode selection and channel allocation for full-duplex cognitive femtocell networks (2015) Proceedings of the WCNC 2015, New Orlean, LA; https://www.qualcomm.com/1000x, The 1000x Data Challenge (Online), Available from: 〈〉; Cheng, S.-M., Lien, S.-Y., Chu, F.-S., Chen, K.-C., On exploiting cognitive radio to mitigate interference in macro/femto heterogeneous networks (2011) IEEE Wireless Commun., 18 (3), pp. 40-47; Huang, L., Zhu, G., Du, X., Cognitive femtocell networks: an opportunistic spectrum access for future indoor wireless coverage (2013) IEEE Wireless Commun., 20 (2), pp. 44-51; Xiang, J., Zhang, Y., Skeie, T., Xie, L., Downlink spectrum sharing for cognitive radio femtocell networks (2010) IEEE Syst.

Although the general requirements of 5G systems are progressively taking shape, the technological issues raised by such a vision are still partially unclear. Nonetheless, general consensus has been reached upon some specific challenges, such as the need for 5G wireless access networks to support massive access by MTDs, as a consequence of the proliferation of M2M services. In this paper, we describe the main challenges raised by the M2M vision, focusing in particular on the problems related to the support of massive MTD access in current cellular communication systems. Then we analyze the most common approaches proposed in the literature to enable the coexistence of conventional and M2M services in the current and next generation of cellular wireless systems. We finally conclude by pointing out the research challenges that require further investigation in order to provide full support to the M2M paradigm. © 2015 The Authors","5G; M2M; Massive access; MTC; MTD",,,,,,,,"Zanella, A., Bui, N., Castellani, A., Vangelista, L., Zorzi, M., (2014) Internet of Things for Smart Cities, IEEE Internet Things J., 1 (February (1)), pp. 22-32; Atzori, L., Iera, A., Morabito, G., (2010) The internet of things: A survey, Comput.
