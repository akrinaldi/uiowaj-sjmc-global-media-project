It may seem that whether a system works is a function of its technical design, but it is also accomplished through ongoing forms of discretionary work by many actors. Based on six months of ethnographic fieldwork with a corporate data science team, we describe how actors involved in a corporate project negotiated what work the system should do, how it should work, and how to assess whether it works. These negotiations laid the foundation for how, why, and to what extent the system ultimately worked. We describe three main findings. First, how already-existing technologies are essential reference points to determine how and whether systems work. Second, how the situated resolution of development challenges continually reshapes the understanding of how and whether systems work. Third, how business goals, and especially their negotiated balance with data science imperatives, affect a system’s working. We conclude with takeaways for critical data studies, orienting researchers to focus on the organizational and cultural aspects of data science, the third-party platforms underlying data science systems, and ways to engage with practitioners’ imagination of how systems can and should work. © The Author(s) 2020.",Corporate data science; critical data studies; data science ethnography; human work; invisible work; workability,,,,,,"National Science Foundation, NSF

In this intervention, we describe the various functions served by these projects. First, they offer tutorials and tools for both dataviz practitioners and their publics to encourage critical thinking about how COVID-19 data is sourced and modeled—and to consider which subjects are not interpellated in those data sets, and why not. Second, they demonstrate how the pandemic’s spatial logics inscribe themselves in our immediate material landscapes. And third, they remind us of our capacity to personalize and participate in the creation of meaningful COVID visualizations—many of which represent other scales and dimensions of the pandemic, especially the quarantine quotidian. Together, the official maps and counter-plots acknowledge that the pandemic plays out differently across different scales: COVID-19 is about global supply chains and infection counts and TV ratings for presidential press conferences, but it is also about local dynamics and neighborhood mutual aid networks and personal geographies of mitigation and care. © The Author(s) 2020.",Counter-mapping; data visualization; embodiment,,,,,,,,,"Alberda, A., Alamalhodaei, A., Feigenbaum, A., (2020), www.medium.com/nightingale/covid-19-data-literacy-is-for-everyone-46120b58cec9, (May,) COVID-19 data literacy is for everyone., :, (accessed 19 June 2020; (2020), https://static1.squarespace.com/static/59f87d66914e6b2a2c51b657/t/5e7bbeef7811c16d3a8768eb/1585168132614/AAFCZine3_CareintheTimeofCoronavirus.pdf, (accessed 11 May 2020; Bazzaz, D., (2020), www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/education/qa-avi-schiffmann-the-washington-state-teen-behind-a-coronavirus-website-with-millions-of-views/, (,) Avi Schiffmann, the Washington state teen behind a coronavirus website with millions of views., 3 March. :, (accessed 11 May 2020; (2020), https://birbs.glitch.me/, (,) :, (accessed 11 May 2020; Bliss, L., Martin, J., (2020), www.citylab.com/life/2020/04/neighborhood-maps-coronavirus-lockdown-stay-at-home-art/610018/, (,) Your maps of life under lockdown., 15 April. :, (accessed 11 May 2020; Bronner, L., Koerth, M., Mithani, J., (2020), www.fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-its-so-freaking-hard-to-make-a-good-covid-19-model/, (, a) Why it’s so freaking hard to make a good COVID-19 model., 31 March. :, (accessed 13 May 2020; Bronner, L., Koerth, M., Mithani, J., (2020), www.fivethirtyeight.com/features/a-comic-strip-tour-of-the-wild-world-of-pandemic-modeling/, (, b) A comic strip tour of the wild world of pandemic modeling., 13 April. :, (accessed 13 May 2020; Campolo, A., (2020), https://sifk.uchicago.edu/news/flattening-the-curve-visualization-and-pandemic-knowledge/, (,) Flattening the curve: Visualization and pandemic knowledge., 1 April. :, (accessed 11 May 2020; Case, N., Salathé, M., (2020), https://ncase.me/covid-19/, (,) What haens next?

The first months of the pandemic saw many governments publicly performing reliance on epidemiological and modelling expertise in order to signal that data would be the basis for justifying whatever population-level measures of control were judged necessary. But comprehensive data has not become available, and instead scientists, policymakers and the public find themselves in a situation where policy inputs determine the data available and vice versa. This essay asks how we can live with what Amoore has termed ‘post-Cartesian doubt’ in situations of existential risk, and what kind of approach to science and data can answer the moral and human demands of a situation such as the Covid-19 pandemic. I suggest that science and policy could be able to control the pandemic better by addressing the sources of uncertainty and missing data not as gaps in the information landscape, but as individuals who are likely to be members of less-visible and less powerful groups including low-wage workers, the elderly, migrants, prisoners and others. This would shift both data use and policy toward an ethics of care, an embodied approach which asks what people need and how they behave in relation to each other, rather than how to manage population-level behaviour. This approach, I argue, is more appropriate for pandemic response than a utilitarian calculation of how many people each country should expect to lose as a result of the disease. © The Author(s) 2020.",Covid-19; data feminism; ethics of care; policy; public health; risk,,,,,,"European Research Council, ERC: 757247

The hashtag encouraged people to visit local hospitals to take pictures and videos of empty hospitals to help “prove” that the COVID-19 pandemic is an elaborate hoax. Using techniques from Social Network Analysis, this case study examines how this conspiracy theory propagated on Twitter and whether the hashtag virality was aided by the use of automation or coordination among Twitter users. We found that while much of the content came from users with limited reach, the oxygen that fueled this conspiracy in its early days came from a handful of prominent conservative politicians and far right political activists on Twitter. These power users used this hashtag to build awareness about the campaign and to encourage their followers to break quarantine and film what is happening at their local hospitals. After the initial boost by a few prominent accounts, the campaign was mostly sustained by pro-Trump accounts, followed by a secondary wave of propagation outside the U.S. The rise of the #FilmYourHospital conspiracy from a single tweet demonstrates the ongoing challenge of addressing false, viral information during the COVID-19 pandemic. While the spread of misinformation can be potentially mitigated by fact-checking and directing people to credible sources of information from public health agencies, false and misleading claims that are driven by politics and supported by strong convictions and not science are much harder to root out. © The Author(s) 2020.",#FilmYourHospital; conspiracy theory; COVID-19; online networks; Social media; Twitter,,,,,,"Canada Research Chairs

This approach focuses on the infrastructural components that condition the disclosure of smartphone users’ data – namely the permissions that apps request and the third-party corporations they work with. We explore the surveillance ecology of mobile apps and thereby the privacy implications of everyday smartphone use through three analytical perspectives: The first focuses on the ‘appscapes’ of individual smartphone users and investigates the consequences of which and how many mobile apps users download on their phones; the second compares different types of apps in order to study the app ecology and the relationships between app and third-party service providers; and the third focuses on a particular app category and discusses the functional as well as the commercial incentives for permissions and third-party collaborations. Thereby, the article advances an interdisciplinary dialogue between critical data studies, political economy and app studies, and pushes an empirical and critical perspective on mobile communication, app ecologies and data economies. © The Author(s) 2020.",applications; critical data studies; digital infrastructures; Mobile apps; political economy,,,,,,Carlsbergfondet: CF16-0001,"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This was included in the upload of the original article.

Moving from this call to meaningful forms of transparency, where the Big Data details are available, useful, and manageable is more difficult. Most challenging is moving from that difficult task of meaningful transparency to the seemingly impossible scenario of achieving, consistently and ubiquitously, meaningful forms of consent, where individuals are aware of data practices and implications, understand these realities, and agree to them as well. This commentary unpacks these concerns in the online consent context. It emphasizes that self-governance fallacy pervades current approaches to achieving digital forms of privacy, exemplified by the assertion that transparency and information access alone are enough to help individuals achieve privacy and reputation protections. © The Author(s) 2020.",consent; information policy; internet governance; Privacy; privacy policy; transparency,,,,,,,,,"Ananny, M., Crawford, K., Seeing without knowing: Limitations of the transparency ideal and its application to algorithmic accountability (2018) New Media & Society, 20 (3), pp. 973-989; Balkin, J.M., Information fiduciaries and the first amendment (2015) UC Davis Law Review, 49, pp. 1183-1234; Brandeis, L.D., (1913), (,) What publicity can do., December 20, 1913, p. 10; DeNardis, L., Hackl, A.M., Internet governance by social media platforms (2015) Telecommunications Policy, 39 (9), pp. 761-770; Draper, N.A., Turow, J., The corporate cultivation of digital resignation (2019) New Media & Society, , 21(8): 1824--1839; Kroll, J.A., Huey, J., Barocas, S., Accountable algorithms (2017) University of Pennsylvania Law Review, 165, pp. 633-705; Lippmann, W., (1927) The Phantom Public, , New Brunswick, Transaction Publishers, (, 2009 edition; McDonald, A.M., Cranor, L.F., The cost of reading privacy policies (2008) Journal of Law and Policy for the Information Society, 4, pp. 540-565; Obar, J.A., Big Data and The Phantom Public: Walter Lippmann and the fallacy of data privacy self-management (2015) Big Data & Society, 2 (2). , (,): 1-16; Obar, J.A., (2019), https://ixmaps.ca/transparency.php, (,) Keeping internet users the know or the dark?

Systems administrators and computer science textbooks may expect databases to be instantiated in a small number of technologies (e.g., relational or graph-based database management systems), but there are numerous examples of databases in non-conventional or unexpected technologies, such as spreadsheets or other assemblages of files linked through code. Consequently, we ask: How do the materialities of non-conventional databases differ from or align with the materialities of conventional relational systems? What properties of the database do the creators of these artifacts invoke in their rhetoric describing these systems—or in the data models underlying these digital objects? To answer these questions, we conducted a close analysis of four non-conventional scientific databases. By examining the materialities of information representation in each case, we show how scholarly communication regimes shape database materialities—and how information organization paradigms shape scholarly communication. These cases show abandonment of certain constraints of relational database construction alongside maintenance of some key relational data organization strategies. We discuss the implications that these relational data paradigms have for data use, preservation, and sharing, and discuss the need to support a plurality of data practices and paradigms. © The Author(s) 2020.",Data curation; data science; databases; materiality; relational paradigms; software studies,,,,,,"Institute of Museum and Library Services, IMLS: -07-18-0118-18","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was funded in part by IMLS grant #RE-07-18-0118-18.",,"Bardzell, S., (2010), (,) Feminist HCI: Taking stock and outlining an agenda for design.

It made visible regularities that were invisible at the individual level, further supporting the classificatory approach of insurance and the assumption that all members of a class are identical risks. The second part focuses on the reversal of perspective currently occurring in data analysis with predictive analytics, and how this conceptually contradicts the collective basis of insurance. The tremendous volume of data and the personalization promise through accurate individual prediction indeed deeply shakes the homogeneity hypothesis behind pooling. The third part attempts to assess the extent of this shift in motor insurance. Onboard devices that collect continuous driving behavioural data could import this new paradigm into these products.

Data management is a vital component of data-driven systems, but what constitutes ‘good’ data management is not straightforward. Academic attention is turning to the question of what ‘good data’ might look like more generally, but public views are absent from these debates. This paper addresses this gap, reporting on a survey of the public on their views of data management approaches, undertaken by the authors and administered in the UK, where departure from the EU makes future data legislation uncertain. The survey found that respondents dislike the current approach in which commercial organizations control their personal data and prefer approaches that give them control over their data, that include oversight from regulatory bodies or that enable them to opt out of data gathering. Variations of data trusts – that is, structures that provide independent stewardship of data – were also preferable to the current approach, but not as widely preferred as control, oversight and opt out options. These features therefore constitute ‘good data management’ for survey respondents. These findings align only in part with principles of good data identified by policy experts and researchers. Our findings nuance understandings of good data as a concept and of good data management as a practice and point to where further research and policy action are needed. © The Author(s) 2020.",conjoint experiment; data management; data trust; Good data; personal data store; public perceptions,,,,,,"British Broadcasting Corporation, BBC

As such, the collection, analysis and use of student data are increasingly crucial in operational and strategic planning, and in delivering appropriate and effective learning experiences to students. Student data – not only in what data is (not) collected, but also how the data is framed and used – has material and discursive effects, both permanent and fleeting. We have to critically engage claims that artificial intelligence and the ever expansive/expanding systems of algorithmic decision-making provide speedy, accessible, revealing, panoramic, prophetic and smart analyses of students' risks, potential and learning needs.

Here, we draw from the responses of 178 people who identified as non-heterosexual or non-cisgender to demographic questions we developed regarding gender and sexual orientation. Demographic data commonly imagines identity as fixed, singular, and discrete. However, our findings suggest that, for LGBTQ people, gender and sexual identities are often multiple and in flux. An overwhelming majority of our respondents reported shifting in their understandings of their sexual identities over time. In addition, for many of our respondents, gender identity was made up of overlapping factors, including the relationship between gender and transgender identities. These findings challenge researchers to reconsider how identity is understood as and through data. Drawing from critical data studies, feminist and queer digital media studies, and social justice initiatives like Data for Black Lives, we call for a reimagining of identity-based data as “queer data” or “data for queer lives.” We offer also recommendations for researchers to develop more inclusive survey questions. At the same time, we address the ways that queer perspectives destabilize the underlying logics of data by resisting classification and “capture.” For marginalized people, the stakes of this work extend beyond academia, especially in the era of algorithms and big data when the issue of who is or is not “counted” profoundly affects visibility, access, and power in the digital realm. © The Author(s) 2020.",Data; digital media; gender; identity; LGBTQ; sexuality,,,,,,,,,"Adler, M., (2017) Cruising the Library: Perversities in the Organization of Knowledge, , New York, Fordham University Press; Baucom, E., An exploration into archival descriptions of LGBTQ materials (2018) The American Archivist, 81 (1), pp. 65-83; Benbouzid, B., To predict and to manage: Predictive policing in the United States (2019) Big Data & Society, 6 (1), pp. 1-13; Bivens, R., The gender binary will not be deprogrammed: Ten years of coding gender on Facebook (2017) New Media & Society, 19 (6), pp. 880-898; Boyd, B., Crawford, K., Critical questions for big data: Provocations for a cultural, technological, and scholarly phenomenon (2012) Information, Communication & Society, 15 (5), pp. 662-679; Bowker, G.C., (2005) Memory Practices in the Sciences, p. 184. , Cambridge, MIT Press; Browne, K., Queer quantification or queer(y)ing quantification: Creating lesbian, gay, bisexual, or heterosexual citizens through governmental social research (2010) Queer Methods and Methodologies: Intersecting Queer Theories and Social Science Research, pp. 231-249. , Browne K., Nash C.J., (eds), New York, Routledge, In:, (eds; Browne, K., Nash, C.J., Queer methods and methodologies: An introduction (2010) Queer Methods and Methodologies: Intersecting Queer Theories and Social Science Research, pp. 1-23. , Browne K., Nash C.J., (eds), New York, Routledge, In:, (eds; Dalton, C., Thatcher, J., (2014) What Does a Critical Data Studies Look Like, and Why Do We Care?

Using the concept of the ‘trade-off fallacy’, this article argues that current data access and governance structures, based on particular construals of public benefit in the context of public health data, largely negate the possibility of effective control by individuals over future uses of personal health data. This generates a health data version of the trade-off fallacy that enables widespread involvement of commercial actors in personal data, despite public concerns over commercial involvement in, and potential exploitation of, public health data. The article suggests that, despite ostensibly robust regulatory and governance structures, this publicly held data is potentially subject to similar logics of accumulation as seen elsewhere in the digital economy, highlighting the inadequacies of current data regulatory frameworks in the digital era. © The Author(s) 2020.",Big Data; digital economy; digital governance; digital regulation; political economy; public benefits; Public health data; public interest; trade-off fallacy,,,,,,,,,"Aitken, M., de St. Jorre, J., Pagliari, C., Public responses to the sharing and linkage of health data for research purposes: A systematic review and thematic synthesis of qualitative studies (2016) BMC Medical Ethics, 17, p. 73; Aitken, M., Porteous, C., Creamer, E., Who benefits and how?

Predictive modeling is increasingly the subject of scholarly and public criticism. Less common, however, is scrutiny directed at the data that inform predictive models beyond concerns about homogenous training data or general epistemological critiques of data. In this paper, I draw from a qualitative case study set in higher education in the United States to investigate the making of data. Data analytics projects at universities have become more pervasive and intensive to better understand and anticipate undergraduate student bodies. Drawing from 12 months of ethnographic research at a large public university, I analyze the ways data personnel at the institution—data scientists, administrators, and programmers—sort student data into “attributes” and “behaviors,” where “attributes” are demographic data that students “can’t change.” “Behaviors,” in contrast, are data defined as reflective of what students can choose: attending and paying attention in class, studying on campus, among other data which personnel categorize as what students have control over. This discursive split enables the institution nudge students to make responsible choices according to behavior data that correlate with success in the predictive model. In discussing how personnel type, sort, stabilize, and nudge on behavior data, this paper examines the contingencies of data making processes and implications for the application of student data. © The Author(s) 2020.",Big Data; higher education; institutions; nudge; predictive modeling; student data,,,,,,Purdue University,"Sincere thanks to Zoe Nyssa, Evelyn Blackwood, Kendall Roark, and Geneva Smith for reading previous drafts and offering insightful feedback.

But what does it mean to have and to be a body in the COVID-19 pandemic? The COVID-19 pandemic offers data scholars the unique opportunity, and perhaps obligation, to revisit and reinvent the fundamental concepts of our mediated experiences. The article critiques the data double, a longstanding concept in critical data and media studies, as incompatible with the current public health and social distancing imperative. The data double, instead, is now the presupposition of a new data entity, which will emerge out of a current data shimmer: a long-sustaining transition that blurs the older boundaries of bodies and the social, and establishes new ethical boundaries around the (in)activity and (im)mobility of doing nothing to do something. The data double faces a unique dynamic in the COVID-19 pandemic between boredom and exhaustion. Following the currently simple rule to stay home presents data scholars the opportunity to revisit the meaning of data as something given, a shimmering embodied relationship with data that contributes to the common good in a global health crisis. © The Author(s) 2020.",COVID-19; data double; data shimmer; embodiment; pandemic; quarantine,,,,,,Canada Research Chairs,"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This research was undertaken, in part, thanks to funding from the Canada Research Chairs programme.",,"Abeysinghe, S., When the spread of disease becomes a global event: The classification of pandemics (2013) Social Studies of Science, 43 (6), pp. 905-926; Anderson, R.M., Heesterbeek, H., Klinkenberg, D., How will country-based mitigation measures influence the course of the COVID-19 epidemic?

Health systems face growing public pressure to collect data on patient “social factors,” and advocates and public officials seek to leverage such data sources as a means of system transformation. Despite the promise of this “data-driven” strategy, there is little empirical work that examines big data in action directly within the sites of care expected to transform. In this article, I present a case study on one such initiative, focusing on a large public safety-net health system’s initiation of sexual orientation and gender identity (SOGI) data collection within the clinical setting. Drawing from ethnographic fieldwork and in-depth interviews with providers, staff, and administrators, I highlight three main challenges that elude big data’s grasp on inequality: (1) provider and staff’s limited understanding of the social significance of data collection; (2) patient perception of the cultural insensitivity of data items; and (3) clinic need to balance data requests with competing priorities within a constrained time window. These issues reflect structural challenges within safety-net care that big data alone are unable to address in advancing social justice. I discuss these findings by considering the present data-driven strategy alongside two complementary courses of action: diversifying the health professions workforce and clinical education reform. To truly advance justice, we need more than “just data”: we need to confront the fundamental conditions of social inequality. © The Author(s) 2020.",Big data analytics; electronic health records; gender and sexual minority health; health disparities; health equity; quantification; safety-net; United States,,,,,,"University of California, San Francisco, UCSF","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This research was supported by UCSF Departments of Social and Behavioral Sciences and Anthropology, History, and Social Medicine.",,"(2019), https://ainowinstitute.org/discriminatingsystems.pdf, New York: Author. :, (accessed 6 May 2020; Anderson, A.C., O’Rourke, E., Chin, M.H., Promoting health equity and eliminating disparities through performance measurement and payment (2018) Health Affairs (Project Hope), 37 (3), pp. 371-377; Andrulis, D.P., Siddiqui, N.J., Health reform holds both risks and rewards for safety-net providers and racially and ethnically diverse patients (2011) Health Affairs (Project Hope), 30 (10), pp. 1830-1836; Berrey, E., (2015) The Enigma of Diversity: The Language of Race and the Limits of Racial Justice, , Chicago, University of Chicago Press; Betancourt, J.R., Green, A.R., Carrillo, J.E., Defining cultural competence: A practical framework for addressing racial/ethnic disparities in health and health care (2003) Public Health Reports (Washington, D.C. : 1974), 118, pp. 293-302; Bigo, D., Isin, E., Ruppert, E., (2019) Data Politics: Worlds, Subjects, Rights, , New York, Routledge; Bowker, G.C., Star, S.L., (1999) Sorting Things Out: Classification and Its Consequences, , Cambridge, MA, MIT Press; boyd, D., Crawford, K., Critical questions for big data: Provocations for a cultural, technological, and scholarly phenomenon (2012) Information, Communication & Society, 15 (5), pp. 662-679; Braveman, P., What are health disparities and health equity?

The spread of machine learning in finance challenges existing practices of modelling and model use and creates a demand for practical solutions for how to manage the complexity pertaining to these techniques. Drawing on interviews with quants applying machine learning techniques to financial problems, the article examines how these people manage model complexity in the process of devising machine learning-powered trading algorithms. The analysis shows that machine learning quants use Ockham’s razor – things should not be multiplied without necessity – as a heuristic tool to prevent excess model complexity and secure a certain level of human control and interpretability in the modelling process. I argue that understanding the way quants handle the complexity of learning models is a key to grasping the transformation of the human’s role in contemporary data and model-driven finance. The study contributes to social studies of finance research on the human–model interplay by exploring it in the context of machine learning model use. © The Author(s) 2020.",algorithmic trading; distributed cognition; explainability; machine learning models; model overfitting; Ockham’s razor,,,,,,"European Research Council, ERC

The attempts made by these organisations to connect analytically with users raise questions about whether surveillance, and its associated ethical and rights-based concerns, are intensified. The articles in this special themed issue explore this question from both organisational and user perspectives. They highlight the hype which firms use to drive consumer, employee and service user engagement with analytics within both private and public spaces. Further, they explore extent to which, through Big Data, there is an attempt to expand surveillance into the emotional registers of domestic, embodied experience. Collectively, the papers reveal a fascinating nexus between the much-vaunted potential of analytics, the data practices themselves and the newly configured intimate spheres which have been drawn into the commercial value chain. Together, they highlight the need for conceptual and regulatory innovation so that analytics in practice may be better understood and critiqued. Whilst there is now a rich variety of scholarship on Big Data Analytics, critical perspectives on the organising practices of Big Data Analytics and its surveillance implications are thin on the ground. Combined, the articles published in this special theme begin to address this shortcoming. © The Author(s) 2020.",Big Data Analytics; commercial logics; informational trajectory; intimate spheres; organisational context; Surveillance,,,,,,"Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada, SSHRC: Partnership Grant 'Big Data Surveillance' 895-2015",,,"Aritzia, T., Housing markets performing class: Middle-class cultures and market professionals in Chile (2014) The Sociological Review, 622, pp. 1-21; Ball, K., DiDomenico, M., Nunan, D., Big data surveillance and the body subject (2016) Body & Society, 22 (2), pp. 58-81; Cochoy, F., Hansel and Gretel at the grocery store (2008) Journal of Cultural Economy, 1 (2), pp. 145-163; Cronin, A., Regimes of mediation: Advertising practitioners as cultural intermediaries?

New data-driven technologies, including wearable health trackers, smartphone sensors, predictive modelling and Big Data analytics, are challenging these established practices. In tracking insurance clients’ behaviour, these innovations promise the reduction of insurance costs and more accurate pricing through the personalisation of premiums and products. Building on insights from the sociology of markets and Science and Technology Studies (STS), this article investigates the role of economic experimentation in the making of data-driven personalisation markets in insurance. We document a case study of a car insurance experiment, launched by a Belgian direct insurance company in 2016 to set up an experiment of tracking driving style behavioural data of over 5000 participants over a one-year period. Based on interviews and document analysis, we outline how this in vivo experiment was set-up, which interventions and manipulations were imposed to make the experiment successful, and how the study was evaluated by the actors. Using JL Austin’s distinction between happy and unhappy statements, we argue how the experiment, despite its failure not to provide the desired evidence (on the link between driving style behaviour and accident losses), could be considered a ‘happy’ event. We conclude by highlighting the role of economic experiments ‘in the wild’ for the making of future markets of data-driven personalisation. © The Author(s) 2020.",Big Data; experimentation; Insurance; personalisation; science & technology studies (STS); sociology of markets,,,,,,"KU Leuven: 3H180176

This article explores, via the ‘value-chain’ approach, the evolution of digital governance research, and aligns it with current developments associated with data analytics, often referred to as ‘Big Data’. In many ways, the current discourse around Big Data reiterates and repeats established commentaries within the eGovernment research community. This body of knowledge provides an opportunity to reflect on the ‘promise’ of Big Data, both in relation to service delivery and policy formulation. This includes, issues associated with the quality and reliability of data, from mixing public and private sector data, issues associated with the ownership of raw and manipulated data, and ethical issues concerning surveillance and privacy. These insights and the issues raised help assess the value of Big Data in government and smart city environments. © The Author(s) 2020.",Big Data; eGovernment; privacy; public value chain; smart cities; value chain analysis,,,,,,"FundaÃ§Ã£o de Amparo Ã  Pesquisa do Estado de SÃ£o Paulo, FAPESP

And yet, they are consumer devices. Proponents of these devices presuppose that measuring will be helpful, and that data will be meaningful. However, a growing body of research suggests that self-tracking data does not necessarily make sense to users. Drawing together data studies and digital health research, we aim to further research on data ambivalence, a term we use to refer to the ambiguities and uncertainties people experience when interpreting their own data, as well as the critical obligation towards cultivating ethically sound uses and responses to such data in context. We develop the relationship between data, interpretation, and context as a central theoretical and practical problem in the datafication of healthcare. We then show how interpretation and context matter for data ambivalence through an empirical study of heart patients with an implanted advanced pacemaker who were offered a Fitbit wristband for self-tracking as part of a research project. We argue that the hope, anxiety, and doubt connected to the promise and accuracy of data are tempered by the context and purpose of self-tracking, and by individual circumstances. Finally, we link the findings on context-sensitivity in data interpretation to questions about response-ability in cloud-based care infrastructures. We discuss the ethical dilemmas associated with the use of commercial wellness-technologies in healthcare, and with researching such emerging practices. © The Author(s) 2020.",care infrastructures; chronic patients; ethic of response-ability; Fitbit; interpretation; Self-tracking,,,,,,Innovationsfonden: 72-2014-1,"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: The project was supported by the Innovation Fund Denmark, grant no. 72-2014-1.",,"Ancker, J.S., Witteman, H.O., Hafeez, B., You get reminded you’re a sick person”: Personal data tracking and patients with multiple chronic conditions (2015) Journal of Medical Internet Research, 17, pp. e202-e212; Andersen, T.O., Large-scale and long-term co-design of digital health (2019) Interactions, 26 (5), pp. 74-77; Andersen, T.O., Bansler, J.P., Kensing, F., Aligning concerns in telecare: Three concepts to guide the design of patient-centred e-health (2019) Computer Supported Cooperative Work, 28, pp. 1039-1072; Chapple, A., Rogers, A., Self‐care’ and its relevance to developing demand management strategies: A review of qualitative research (1999) Health & Social Care in the Community, 7, pp. 445-454. , (,) ‘; Choe, E.K., Lee, N.B., Lee, B., (2014), (,) Understanding quantified-selfers’ practices collecting and exploring personal data.

Focus is on the specific ways in which outsourcing of data tasks to myriad ‘micro-workers’, recruited and managed through specialized platforms, powers virtual assistants, self-driving vehicles and connected objects. Using qualitative data from multiple sources, we show that micro-work performs a variety of functions, between three poles that we label, respectively, ‘artificial intelligence preparation’, ‘artificial intelligence verification’ and ‘artificial intelligence impersonation’. Because of the wide scope of application of micro-work, it is a structural component of contemporary artificial intelligence production processes – not an ephemeral form of support that may vanish once the technology reaches maturity stage. Through the lens of micro-work, we prefigure the policy implications of a future in which data technologies do not replace human workforce but imply its marginalization and precariousness. © The Author(s) 2020.",artificial intelligence; datafied production processes; Digital platform labour; machine learning; micro-work,,,,,,"Fondation Maison des Sciences de lâHomme, FMSH","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This paper presents results of a larger study called Digital Platform Labour (DiPLab), co-funded by Maison des Sciences de l’Homme Paris-Saclay; Force Ouvrière, a workers’ union, as part of a grant from Institut de recherches économiques et sociales (IRES); and France Stratégie, a service of the French Prime Minister’s office.

We first analyse a range of public documents to identify the key actors, mechanisms and issues which structure societal expectations around artificial intelligence (AI) and an emerging discourse on ethics. We then explore expectations of AI and ethics through a survey of members of the public. Finally, we discuss the implications of our findings for the role of AI in communication governance. We find that, despite societal expectations that we can design ethical AI, and public expectations that developers and governments should share responsibility for the outcomes of AI use, there is a significant divergence between these expectations and the ways in which AI technologies are currently used and governed in large scale communication systems. We conclude that discourses of ‘ethical AI’ are generically performative, but to become more effective we need to acknowledge the limitations of contemporary AI and the requirement for extensive human labour to meet the challenges of communication governance. An effective ethics of AI requires domain appropriate AI tools, updated professional practices, dignified places of work and robust regulatory and accountability frameworks. © The Author(s) 2020.",artificial intelligence; communication governance; Ethics; expectations; performativity; science and technology studies,,,,,,"Science Foundation Ireland, SFI: 13/RC/2106

But what unites all of these financial media is their connection to recordkeeping systems. Each swipe sends data hurtling through invisible infrastructures to verify accounts, record purchase details, exchange funds, and update balances. With payment cards, banks and merchants have been able to amass vast archives of transactional data. This information is a valuable asset in itself. It can be used for in-house data analytics programs or sold as marketing intelligence to third parties. This research examines the development of payment cards in the United States from the late 19th century to present, drawing attention to their fundamental relationship to identification, recordkeeping, and data mining. The history of payment cards, I argue, is not just a history of financial innovation and computing; it is also a history of Big Data and consumer surveillance. This history, moreover, provides insight into the growth of transactional data and the datafication of money in the digital economy. © The Author(s) 2020.",capitalism; credit; money; payment; Surveillance;

The study was conducted in Costa Rica and draws on triangulated data from 30 interviews, 4 focus groups with 22 users, and the study of “rich pictures” made by individuals to graphically represent their understanding of algorithmic recommendations. We found two main folk theories: one that personifies Spotify (and conceives of it as a social being that provides recommendations thanks to surveillance) and another one that envisions it as a system full of resources (and a computational machine that offers an individualized musical experience through the appropriate kind of “training”). Whereas the first theory emphasizes local conceptions of social relations to make sense of algorithms, the second one stresses the role of algorithms in providing a global experience of music and technology. We analyze why people espouse either one of these theories (or both) and how these theories provide users with resources to enact different modalities of power and resistance in relation to recommendation algorithms. We argue that folk theories thus offer a productive way to broaden understanding of what agency means in relation to algorithms. © The Author(s) 2020.",Agency; algorithms; audience research; folk theories; Latin America; music streaming services; surveillance,,,,,,,,,"Bell, S., Berg, T., Morse, S., Towards an understanding of rich picture interpretation (2019) Systemic Practice and Action Research, 32, pp. 601-614; Bell, S., Morse, S., How people use rich pictures to help them think and act (2013) Systemic Practice and Action Research, 26 (4), pp. 331-348; Beuscart, J.S., Maillard, S., Coavoux, S., Les algorithmes de recommandation musicale et l’autonomie de l’auditeur (2019) Réseaux, 213 (1), pp. 17-47; Bucher, T., (2018) If.Then: Algorithmic Power and Politics, , Oxford, Oxford University Press; Checkland, P., (1981) Systems Thinking, Systems Practice, , Chichester, Wiley; Cohn, J., (2019) The Burden of Choice: Recommendations, Subversion and Algorithmic Culture, , New Brunswick, Rutgers University Press; Cyr, J., The pitfalls and promise of focus groups as a data collection method (2016) Sociological Methods & Research, 45 (2), pp. 231-259; Dalton, C., Thatcher, J., What does a critical data studies look like, and why do we care?

Using a dataset of 76.7 million YouTube videos, we explore how digital and computational methods can be leveraged to better understand content moderation and copyright enforcement at a large scale.We used the BERT language model to train a machine learning classifier to identify videos in categories that reflect ongoing controversies in copyright takedowns. We use this to explore, in a granular way, how copyright is enforced on YouTube, using both statistical methods and qualitative analysis of our categorised dataset. We provide a large-scale systematic analysis of removals rates from Content ID’s automated detection system and the largely automated, text search based, Digital Millennium Copyright Act notice and takedown system. These are complex systems that are often difficult to analyse, and YouTube only makes available data at high levels of abstraction. Our analysis provides a comparison of different types of automation in content moderation, and we show how these different systems play out across different categories of content. We hope that this work provides a methodological base for continued experimentation with the use of digital and computational methods to enable large-scale analysis of the operation of automated systems. © The Author(s) 2020.",automated decision-making; Content ID; content moderation; copyright enforcement; Machine learning; YouTube,,,,,,"Australian Research Council, ARC: DE160101542

The doll uses voice recognition software to ‘listen’ to the child and ‘talk back’ by algorithmically selecting a response from 8000 predetermined lines of dialogue. As such, it is a useful example of how marketers use customer relationship management systems that rely on sophisticated data collection and analysis techniques to create a relationship between companies and customers in which both parties are positioned as active participants who are able to obtain what they wish from the interaction. I use dialogic analysis to see how Mattel ‘makes sense’ of the dialogue as a dialogic partner. I argue that, in spite of the rhetoric of instantaneity and personalization, in which the technology is positioned as an immediate response to a child’s imagination, Mattel’s dialogic communication is both asynchronous and carefully crafted to fit the child’s responses within predetermined consumer subjectivities that are crafted to encourage particular kinds of consumption. Although the dialogue spoken by Hello Barbie is able to situate Barbie as an active subject, the control exercised by the company in order to elicit data for customer relationship management purposes and steer the dialogue to brand-friendly messages relegates the child to a passive role. Accordingly, the doll fails to deliver the promises of customer relationship management. © The Author(s) 2020.",active/passive consumers; Children’s marketing; customer relationship management systems; dialogic analysis; Hello Barbie; surveillance of children,,,,,,"Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada, SSHRC","The author would like to thank the peer reviewers for their insightful comments on earlier drafts of this article, and the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada for their support.",,"(2019), https://www.amazon.ca/s?k=barbie+veterinarian&crid=1KHHWJIZ5Y774&sprefix=barbie+veter%2Ctoys%2C168&ref=nb_sb_ss_fb_1_12, (,) Barbie Veterinarian. :, (accessed 28 February 2019; Bakhtin, M., (1986) Speech Genres & Other Late Essays, , Austin, University of Texas Press; Bauman, Z., (2007) Consuming Life, , Cambridge, Polity Press; Beckett, A., Nayak, A., The reflexive consumer (2008) Marketing Theory, 8 (3), pp. 299-317; boyd, D., Levy, K., Marwick, A., The networked nature of algorithmic discrimination (2014) Data and Discrimination: Collected Essays, pp. 53-57. , Ganghadaran S., Eubanks V., Barocas S., (eds), In:, (eds), Washington DC: Open Technology Institute New America; https://www.destinationcrm.com/Articles/CRM-Insights/Insight/Is-Kid-Targeted-Marketing-Unethical-98186.aspx, (2014, 1 August) Is kid-targeted marketing unethical?, August. :, (accessed 16 September 2019; Crocker, C., Nevins, A., (2018), https://www.hulu.com/movie/tiny-shoulders-rethinking-barbie-d1a7351a-4c2e-4704-b9e3-c4466e5673cd, (producer) and, (director) (,) Tiny shoulders: Rethinking Barbie., :, (accessed 28 February 2019; Fink, J., Anthropomorphism and human likeness in design of robots and human-robot interaction (2012) Social Robotics: Proceedings of the International Conference on Social Robotics, pp. 199-208. , Ge S.S., Khatib O., Cabibihan J.J., (eds), In:, (eds; Funches, V., Negative word-of-mouth, misbehavior and revenge (2016) The Dark Side of CRM: Customers, Relationships and Management, pp. 74-90. , Nguyen B., Simkin L., Canhoto A.I., (eds), New York, Routledge, In:, (eds; Gillespie, A., Cornish, F., Sensitizing questions: A method to facilitate analyzing the meaning of an utterance (2014) Integrative Psychological and Behavioral Science, 48 (4), pp. 435-452; Graham, T., (2018), (,) Platforms and hyper-choice on the World Wide Web., 5(1): 1–12; Hall, S., Encoding/decoding (1980) Culture, Media, Language, pp. 128-138. , Hall S., Hobson D., Lowe A., (eds), London, Hutchinson, In:, (eds; Hilu, R., Girl talk and girl tech: Computer talking dolls and the sounds of girls’ play (2016) The Velvet Light Trap, 78, pp. 4-21; Holloway, D., Green, R., The internet of toys (2016) Communication Research and Practice, 2 (4), pp. 506-519; Kent, M.L., Taylor, M., Building dialogic relationships through the World Wide Web (1998) Public Relations Review, 24, pp. 321-334; Lager, M., (2017,.)

Often, policymakers and tech industry players invoke artificial intelligence as the solution to complex challenges around online content, promising that AI is a scant few years away from resolving everything from hate speech to harassment to the spread of terrorist propaganda. Missing from these promises, however, is an acknowledgement that proactive identification and automated removal of user-generated content raises problems beyond issues of “accuracy” and overbreadth--problems that will not be solved with more sophisticated AI. In this commentary, I discuss how the technical realities of content filtering stack up against the protections for freedom of expression in international human rights law. As policymakers and companies around the world turn to AI for communications governance, it is crucial that we recall why legal protections for speech have included presumptions against prior censorship, and consider carefully how proactive content moderation will fundamentally re-shape the relationship between rules, people, and their speech. © The Author(s) 2020.",artificial intelligence; filtering; free expression; human rights; machine learning; natural language processing,,,,,,,,,"(2016), https://www.article19.org/data/files/medialibrary/38586/Blocking_and_filtering_final.pdf, Report, December., (accessed 29 February 2020; Bailey, L., (2017), https://blog.archive.org/2017/02/23/the-internet-archive-pushes-back-on-notice-and-staydown-in-recent-comments-to-the-copyright-office/, (,) The internet archive pushes back on notice and staydown recent comments to the copyright office. :, (accessed 29 February 2020; Balkin, J., Old-school/new-school speech regulation (2014) Harvard Law Review, 127, p. 2296; (1963), (,) 372 U.S. 58; Duarte, N., Llansó, E., Loup, A., (2017), Report, Center for Democracy & Technology, USA, November; Dwoskin, E., Timberg, C., (2019), (,) Inside YouTube’s struggles to shut down video of the New Zealand shooting – And the humans who outsmarted its systems., 18 March; Emerson, T., (1970) The System of Free Expression, , New York, Vintage Books; Engstrom, E., Feamster, N., (2017), Report, Engine, March; (2018), (,) Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on preventing the dissemination of terrorist content online; (2017), (,) European Council meeting (22 and 23 July) – Conclusions.

The analysis unpacks the relationships between taking a measure, and making and reviewing records. The paper is based on an interview study with people who monitor their blood pressure and/or body mass index/weight. Animated by discussions of ‘data power’ which are, in part, predicated on the flow and aggregation of data, we aim to extend important work concerning the everyday constitution of digital data. In the paper, we adopt and develop the idea of curation as a theory of attention. We introduce the idea of discerning work to characterise the skilful judgements people make about which readings they record, how readings are presented, and about the records they retain and those they discard. We suggest self-monitoring produces partial data, both in the sense that it embodies these judgements, and also because monitoring might be conducted intermittently. We also extend previous analyses by exploring the broad set of materials, digital and analogue, networked and not networked, involved in record keeping to consider the different ways these contributed to regulating attention to self-monitoring. By paying attention to which data is recorded and the occasions when data is not recorded, as well as the ways data is recorded, the research provides specificity to the different ways in which self-monitoring data may or may not flow or contribute to big data sets. We argue that ultimately our analysis contributes to nuancing our understanding of ‘data power’. © The Author(s) 2020.",curation; data power; material methods; partial data; Self-tracking; users,,,,,,Leverhulme Trust: RPG-2015-348,"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was supported by the Leverhulme Trust under Grant RPG-2015-348.",,"Ajana, B., Communal self-tracking: Data philanthropy, solidarity and privacy (2018) Self-Tracking, , Ajana B., (ed), Cham, Palgrave Macmillan, In:, (eds), :,. 125–141; Akrich, M., The de-scription of technical objects (1992) Shaping Technology/Building Society: Studies in Sociotechnical Change, pp. 205-224. , Bijker W., Law J., (eds), Cambridge, MIT Press, In:, (eds; Ancker, J., Witteman, H., Hafeez, B., You get reminded you’re a sick person”: Personal data tracking and patients with multiple chronic conditions (2015) Journal of Medical Internet Research, 17 (8), p. e202; Andrejevic, M., The work of watching one another: Lateral surveillance, risk and governance (2005) Surveillance & Society, 2, pp. 479-497; Davis, J.L., Curation: A theoretical treatment (2017) Information, Communication & Society, 20, pp. 770-783; Didžiokaitė, G., Saukko, P., Greiffenhagen, C., Doing calories: The practices of dieting using calorie counting app MyFitnessPal (2018) Metric Culture: Ontologies of Self-Tracking Practices, pp. 137-155. , Ajana B., (ed), London, Emerald, In:, (ed; Esmonde, K., (2020), ‘There’s only so much data you can handle your life’: Accommodating and resisting self-surveillance women’s running and fitness tracking practices., 12(1): 76–90; Esmonde, K., Jette, S., Assembling the ‘fitbit subject’: A Foucauldian-sociomaterialist examination of social class, gender and self-surveillance on fitbit community message boards (2018) Health: An Interdisciplinary Journal for the Social Study of Health, Illness and Medicine, pp. 1-16. , https://doi.org/10.1177/1363459318800166, Epub ahead of print, first published 19/9/2018; Fiore-Gartland, B., Neff, G., Communication, mediation, and the expectations of data: Data valences across health and wellness communities (2015) International Journal of Communication, 9, pp. 1466-1484; Fox, S., Duggan, M., (2013) Tracking for Health, , Washington, DC, Pew Research Centre; Gatineau, M., Hancock, C., Holman, N., (2014) Adult Obesity and Type 2 Diabetes, , Oxford, Public Health England; Gitelman, L., Jackson, V., Introduction (2013) Raw Data’ Is an Oxymoron, pp. 1-14. , Gitelman L., (ed), Cambridge, MIT Press, In:, (ed; Gorm, N., Shklovski, I., (2019), Episodic use: Practices of care self-tracking., 21, 11–12, 2505–2521; Hammersley, M., Atkinson, P., (1995) Ethnography: Principles in Practice, , London, Routledge; Harper, D., Talking about pictures: A case for photo elicitation (2002) Visual Studies, 17, pp. 13-26; Henwood, F., Marent, B., Understanding digital health: Productive tensions at the intersection of sociology of health and science and technology studies (2019) Sociology of Health & Illness, 41, pp. 1-15; Hooper, L., Anderson, A., Forster, A., (2016), London: Cancer Research UK; Kennedy, H., (2018), Krisis, (, ) Living with data: Aligning data studies and data activism through a focus on everyday experiences of datafication., :, 1: 18–30; Kent, R., Social media and self-tracking: Representing the ‘health self’ (2018) Self-Tracking, pp. 61-76. , Ajana B., (ed), London, Palgrave Macmillan, In:, (ed; Lomborg, S., Frandsen, K., Self-tracking as communication (2016) Information, Communication & Society, 19, pp. 1015-1027; Lomborg, S., Thylstrup, N.B., Schwartz, J., The temporal flows of self-tracking: Checking in, moving on, staying hooked (2018) New Media & Society, 20, pp. 4590-4607; Lupton, D., M-health and health promotion: The digital cyborg and surveillance society (2012) Social Theory & Health, 10 (3), pp. 229-244; Lupton, D., (2013) Fat, , London, Routledge; Lupton, D., (2016) The Quantified Self, , Cambridge, Polity; Lupton, D., How does health feel?

Interviews with data journalists and editors suggest that professional routines resonate with established data journalism epistemologies, values, and norms that appear to be constitutional for an inter-organisational data journalism subculture. At the same time, organisational structure either integrates the journalistic subculture by increasing levels of complexity, formalisation, and centralisation or rejects it by not accommodating it structurally or culturally. The three data teams work along epistemologies of computer-assisted reporting, investigative journalism, and data journalism but differentiate themselves through nuanced understandings of data journalism practice, driven by individual journalists. After a structureless episode, one team sets itself apart as it diverges from data-driven routines and orients itself towards technological and interdisciplinary interactive journalism. The findings show an interdependence of individual efforts, varying conceptualisations of data journalism practice, and interplay between organisational structure and professional culture. © The Author(s) 2020.",Computer-assisted reporting; data journalism; journalism culture; journalistic routines; newsroom organisation; organisational structure,,,,,,,,,"Abell, P., A model of the informal structure (culture) of organizations: Help, trust, rivalry and team spirit (1996) Rationality and Society, 8 (4), pp. 433-452; Anderson, C.W., Between the unique and the pattern: Historical tensions in our understanding of quantitative journalism (2015) Digital Journalism, 3 (3), pp. 349-363; Appelgren, E., Nygren, G., Data journalism in Sweden: Introducing new methods and genres of journalism into ‘old’ organizations (2014) Digital Journalism, 2 (3), pp. 394-405; Bell, E., (2012), https://archives.cjr.org/cover_story/journalism_by_numbers.php, (,) Journalism by numbers.

Algorithmic processing, as well as bias and missteps in the course of their development, all come to shape a cultural realm that in turn determines what they come to be about. It is our contention that a robust analytical frame could be derived from culturally driven Science and Technology Studies while focusing on Callon’s concept of translation. Excitement and apprehensions must find a specific language to move past a state of latency. Translations are thus contextual and highly performative, transforming justifications into legitimate claims, translators into discursive entrepreneurs, and power relations into new forms of governance and governmentality. In this piece, we discuss three cases in which artificial intelligence was deciphered to the public: (i) the Montreal Declaration for a Responsible Development of Artificial Intelligence, held as a prime example of how stakeholders manage to establish the terms of the debate on ethical artificial intelligence while avoiding substantive commitment; (ii) Mark Zuckerberg’s 2018 congressional hearing, where he construed machine learning as the solution to the many problems the platform might encounter; and (iii) the normative renegotiations surrounding the gradual introduction of “killer robots” in military engagements. Of interest are not only the rational arguments put forward, but also the rhetorical maneuvers deployed. Through the examination of the ramifications of these translations, we intend to show how they are constructed in face of and in relation to forms of criticisms, thus revealing the highly cybernetic deployment of artificial intelligence technologies. © The Author(s) 2020.",artificial intelligence; criticisms; cybernetics; governmentality; justification; Translation,,,,,,,,,"Akrich, M., Callon, M., Latour, B., The key to success in innovation part I: The art of interessement (2002) International Journal of Innovation Management, 6 (2), pp. 187-206. , (, a; Akrich, M., Callon, M., Latour, B., The key to success in innovation part II: The art of choosing good spokespersons (2002) International Journal of Innovation Management, 6 (2), pp. 207-225. , (, b; Alexander, J.C., Giesen, B., Mast, J.L., (2006) Social Performance: Symbolic Action, Cultural Pragmatics, and Ritual, , New York, Cambridge University Press, (eds; Boltanski, L., Sociologie critique et sociologie de la critique (1990) Politix, 3 (10), pp. 124-134; Boltanski, L., Thévenot, L., (2006) On Justification: Economies of Worth, , Princeton, Princeton University Press; Borup, M., The sociology of expectations in science and technology (2006) Technology Analysis & Strategic Management, 18 (3-4), pp. 285-298; Burrell, J., How the machine ‘thinks’: Understanding opacity in machine learning algorithms (2016) Big Data & Society, , http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/2053951715622512; Busby, M., (2018), www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/apr/09/killer-robots-pressure-builds-for-ban-as-governments-meet, (,) Killer robots: Pressure builds for ban as governments meet., :, (accessed 7 April 2019; Cadwalladr, C., (2018), www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/apr/11/mark-zuckerberg-congress-testimony-five-questions-ask-facebook-ceo, (,) Five questions Mark Zuckerberg should be asked by congress., :, (accessed 3 April 2019; Callon, M., Struggles and negotiations to define what is problematic and what is not: The socio-logic of translation (1981) The Social Process of Scientific Investigation, pp. 197-219. , Knorr-Cetina, K, (eds), Dordrecht, Reidel, In:, (eds; Callon, M., Some elements of a sociology of translation: Domestication of the scallops and the fishermen of St Brieuc Bay (1984) The Sociological Review, 32 (1), pp. 196-233; (2019), www.stopkillerrobots.org/action-and-achievements/, (accessed 1 April 2019; Cardon, D., La revanche des neurones: L’invention des machines inductives et la controverse de l’intelligence artificielle (2018) Réseaux, 211 (5), pp. 173-220; Crawford, K., Can an algorithm be agonistic?

There is also keen interest in using these technologies to regulate and optimize the emotional experiences of spaces, such as workplaces, hospitals, prisons, classrooms, travel infrastructures, restaurants, retail and chain stores. Developers frequently claim that their applications do not identify people. Taking the claim at face value, this paper asks, what are the privacy implications of emotional AI practices that do not identify individuals? To investigate privacy perspectives on soft non-identifying emotional AI, the paper draws upon the following: over 100 interviews with the emotion detection industry, legal community, policy-makers, regulators and NGOs interested in privacy; a workshop with stakeholders to design ethical codes for using data about emotions; a UK survey of 2068 citizens on feelings about emotion capture technologies. It finds a weak consensus among social stakeholders on the need for privacy, this driven by different interests and motivations. Given this weak consensus, it concludes that there exists a limited window of opportunity to societally agree principles of practice regarding privacy and the use of data about emotions. © The Author(s) 2020.",Affective computing; biometrics; consensus; data protection; emotional AI; group privacy,,,,,,"Arts and Humanities Research Council, AHRC: AH/M006654/1","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was supported by the UK’s Arts and Humanities Research Council [grant number AH/M006654/1].",,"Andrejevic, M., (2013) Infoglut: How Too Much Information Is Changing the Way We Think and Know, , New York, Routledge; (2012), http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/article-29/documentation/opinion-recommendation/files/2012/wp193_en.pdf, (,) Opinion 3/2012 on developments biometric technologies. :, (accessed 30 October 2019; Barrett, L.F., Adolphs, R., Marsella, S., Emotional expressions reconsidered: Challenges to inferring emotion from human facial movements (2019) Psychological Science in the Public Interest, 20 (1), pp. 1-68; Bertaux, D., (1981), (,) From the life-history aroach to the transformation of sociological practice.

As opposed to reverse engineering algorithms to identify how their logic operates, the article proposes to design or ""forward engineer"" algorithmic systems in order to theorize how their consequences are informed by design constraints: the specific problems, use cases, and presuppositions that they respond to. This demands a departure from algorithmic reformism, which responds to concerns about the consequences of algorithmic systems by proposing to make algorithms more transparent or less biased. Instead, by investigating algorithmic systems according to documents that specify their design constraints, we identify how the consequences of algorithms are presupposed by the problems that they propose to solve, the types of solutions that they enlist to solve these problems, and the systems of authority that these solutions depend on. To accomplish this, this article develops a methodological framework for researching the process of designing algorithmic systems. In doing so, it proposes to move beyond reforming the technical implementation details of algorithms in order to address the design problems and constraints that underlie them. © The Author(s) 2020.",algorithmic accountability; algorithmic bias; algorithmic opacity; Critical algorithm studies; design studies; predictive policing,,,,,,"Asian American Studies Center, University of California Los Angeles, AASC, UCLA","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This project was supported by funding from the Graduate Summer Research Mentorship Award at the University of California Los Angeles.",,"Amoore, L., Data derivatives: On the emergence of a security risk calculus for our times (2011) Theory, Culture & Society, 28 (6), pp. 24-43; Ananny, M., Crawford, K., Seeing without knowing: Limitations of the transparency ideal and its application to algorithmic accountability (2018) New Media & Society, 20 (3), pp. 973-989; Bratton, W., Cops count, police matter: Preventing crime and disorder in the 21st century (2018) The Heritage Foundation, , https://www.heritage.org/sites/default/files/2018-03/HL1286.pdf, 2 March, (1286): 1--13; Burrell, J., How the machine ‘thinks’: Understanding opacity in machine learning algorithms (2016) Big Data & Society, 3 (1), pp. 1-12; Chapman, O.B., Sawchuk, K., Research-creation: Intervention, analysis and “family resemblances (2012) Canadian Journal of Communication, 37, pp. 5-26; Diakopoulos, N., (2014), (,) Algorithmic-Accountability: The investigation of Black Boxes.

Automated hash-matching and predictive machine learning tools – what we define here as algorithmic moderation systems – are increasingly being deployed to conduct content moderation at scale by major platforms for user-generated content such as Facebook, YouTube and Twitter. This article provides an accessible technical primer on how algorithmic moderation works; examines some of the existing automated tools used by major platforms to handle copyright infringement, terrorism and toxic speech; and identifies key political and ethical issues for these systems as the reliance on them grows. Recent events suggest that algorithmic moderation has become necessary to manage growing public expectations for increased platform responsibility, safety and security on the global stage; however, as we demonstrate, these systems remain opaque, unaccountable and poorly understood. Despite the potential promise of algorithms or ‘AI’, we show that even ‘well optimized’ moderation systems could exacerbate, rather than relieve, many existing problems with content policy as enacted by platforms for three main reasons: automated moderation threatens to (a) further increase opacity, making a famously non-transparent set of practices even more difficult to understand or audit, (b) further complicate outstanding issues of fairness and justice in large-scale sociotechnical systems and (c) re-obscure the fundamentally political nature of speech decisions being executed at scale. © The Author(s) 2020.",algorithms; artificial intelligence; content moderation; copyright; Platform governance; toxic speech,,,,,,"Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada, SSHRC","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: Gorwa would like to thank the Social Science and Humanities Research Council of Canada and the Canadian Centennial Scholarship fund for supporting his studies.",,"Ananny, M., Crawford, K., Seeing without knowing: Limitations of the transparency ideal and its application to algorithmic accountability (2018) New Media & Society, 20 (3), pp. 973-989; Angwin, J., Grassegger, H., (2017) Facebook's Secret Censorship Rules Protect White Men, , https://www.propublica.org/article/facebook-hate-speech-censorship-internal-documents-algorithms, But Not Black Children, ProPublica, Available at; Barocas, S., Selbst, A., Big data’s disparate impact (2016) California Law Review, 104 (3), p. 671. , https://doi.org/10.15779/Z38BG31; Barocas, S., Crawford, K., Shapiro, A., The Problem With Bias: Allocative Versus Representational Harms in Machine Learning (2017) 9Th Annual Conference of the Special Interest Group for Computing, Information and Society, , http://meetings.sigcis.org/uploads/6/3/6/8/6368912/program.pdf, Philadelphia, PA, Retrieved from; Bar-Ziv, S., Elkin-Koren, N., Behind the scenes of online copyright enforcement: Empirical evidence on notice & takedown (2018) Connecticut Law Review, 50, p. 339; https://doi.org/10.1177/0049124118782533, Berk R, Heidari H, Jabbari S, et al.

But data science has no data of its own and must seek it within real world domains. We call this search for data “prospecting” and argue that the dynamics of prospecting are pervasive in, even characteristic of, data science. Prospecting aims to render the data, knowledge, expertise, and practices of worldly domains available and tractable to data science method and epistemology. Prospecting precedes data synthesis, analysis, or visualization, and is constituted by the upstream work of discovering disordered or inaccessible data resources, thereafter to be ordered and rendered available for computation. Through this work, data science positions itself in the middle of all things—capable of engaging this, that, or any domain—and thus prospecting is a key driver of data science’s ongoing formation as a universal(izing) science. © The Author(s) 2020.",Big Data hubs and spokes; data science; Infrastructure; logic of domains; science policy; science studies,,,,,,"U.S. Department of Energy, USDOE

It contributes to the discussion on consequences of Big Data by showing similarities of datafied campaigns with a type of electoral politics that pre-dates the advent of mass media and is usually regarded as deficient. It thus departs from the predominant perspective on datafication and surveillance, which draws on Foucault, in order to identify the particular challenges that datafication poses in the realm of democratic electoral politics. They are related to four major aspects in which datafied campaigning resembles political clientelism, as opposed to the combination of ideology, issue-based campaigning and media appeal that characterized Western European party politics in the second half of the 20th century. It personalizes the relationship between politicians and voters with the help of intermediaries; it is based on an asymmetric and iterative monitoring of voters; it implies a strong particularism and an affinity with populist appeals; and it is ambivalent with regard to the volition of voters. The identification of these similarities renders general concerns about the consequences of datafied campaigning for democracy more concrete. It offers a mirror in which seemingly novel practices are revealed to have implications that are well known to be problematic for the quality of democracy. © The Author(s) 2020.",Datafication; democracy; microtargeting; political campaigning; political clientelism; voter surveillance,,,,,,"Seventh Framework Programme, FP7

This is essential to establish a “Social Licence” for current and future practices. The notion of a “Social Licence” recognises that there can be meaningful differences between what is legally permissible and what is socially acceptable. Establishing a Social Licence entails public engagement to build relationships of trust and ensure that practices align with public values. While the concept of the Social Licence is well-established in other sectors – notably in relation to extractive industries – it has only very recently begun to be discussed in relation to digital innovation and data-intensive industries. This article therefore draws on existing literature relating to the Social Licence in extractive industries to explore the potential approaches needed to establish a Social Licence for emerging data-intensive industries. Additionally, it draws on well-established literature relating to trust (from psychology and organisational science) to examine the relevance of trust, and trustworthiness, for emerging practices in data-intensive industries. In doing so the article considers the extent to which pursuing a Social Licence might complement regulation and inform codes of practice to place ethical and social considerations at the heart of industry practice. We focus on one key industry: Financial Technology. We demonstrate the importance of combining technical and social approaches to address ethical challenges in data-intensive innovation (particularly relating to Artificial Intelligence) and to establish relationships of trust to underpin a Social Licence for Financial Technology. Such approaches are needed across all areas and industries of data-intensive innovation to complement regulation and inform the development of ethical codes of practice. This is important to underpin culture change and to move beyond rhetorical commitments to develop best practice putting ethics at the heart of innovation. © The Author(s) 2020.",data; ethics; Financial Technology; responsible artificial intelligence; social licence; trust,,,,,,"Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, EPSRC: EP/R033595/1","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This research was funded by the EPSRC, grant reference: EP/R033595/1.",,"Agarwal, A., Beygelzimer, A., Dudík, M., (2018), (,) A reductions aroach to fair classification; Aitken, M., Cunningham-Burley, S., Pagliari, C., Moving from trust to trustworthiness: Experiences of public engagement in the Scottish Health Informatics Programme (2016) Science & Public Policy, 43 (5), pp. 713-723. , (, a; Aitken, M., Haggett, C., Rudolph, D., Practices and rationales of community engagement with wind farms: Awareness raising, consultation, empowerment (2016) Planning Theory & Practice, 17 (4), pp. 557-576. , (, b; Aitken, M., Tully, M.P., Porteous, C., Consensus statement on public involvement and engagement with data-intensive health research (2019) International Journal of Population Data Science, 4 (1), pp. 1-6; Allen J, Adams C and Flack F 2019.

However, since November 2017, Facebook has introduced a new limitation on the maximum amount of page posts retrievable through their Graph application programming interface, while there is limited documentation on how these posts are selected. This paper compares two datasets of the same Facebook page, a full dataset obtained before the introduction of the limitation and a partial dataset obtained after, and employs bootstrapping technique to assess the bias caused by the new limitation. This paper demonstrates that posts with high user engagement, Photo posts and Video posts, are over-represented, while Link posts are under-represented. Top-term analysis reveals that there are significant differences in the most prominent terms between the full and partial dataset. This paper also reverse engineered the new application programming interface’s ranking algorithm to identify the features of a post that would affect its odds of being selected. Sentiment analysis reveals that there are significant differences in the sentiment word usage between the selected and non-selected posts. This paper has significant implications for the representativeness of research that use Facebook page data collected after the introduction of the limitation. © The Author(s) 2020.",application programming interface; Bias detection; data mining; Facebook pages; social media research,,,,,,University of Edinburgh,"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: The publication fee is supported by the CAHSS Open Access Fund of the University of Edinburgh.",,"Bakshy, E., Messing, S., Adamic, L.A., Exposure to ideologically diverse news and opinion on Facebook (2015) Science (New York, N.Y.), 348 (6239), pp. 1130-1132; Bessi, A., Zollo, F., Del Vicario, M., Users polarization on Facebook and YouTube (2016) Plos One, 11 (8), p. e0159641; Blei, D.M., Ng, A.Y., Jordan, M.I., Latent Dirichlet allocation (2003) Journal of Machine Learning Research, 3, pp. 993-1022; Bodle, R., Regimes of sharing (2011) Information, Communication & Society, 14 (3), pp. 320-337; Bruns, A., Bechmann, A., Burgess, J., (2018), https://aoir.org/facebook-shuts-the-gate-after-the-horse-has-bolted/, (,) Facebook shuts the gate after the horse has bolted, and hurts real research the process. :, (accessed 30 January 2020; Caton, S., Hall, M., Weinhardt, C., How do politicians use Facebook?

Our starting point is a contradiction at the heart of digital marketing namely that digital marketing brings about unprecedented levels of consumer empowerment and autonomy and total control over and manipulation of consumer decision-making. We argue that this contradiction of digital marketing is resolved via the notion of relevance, which represents what Fredric Jameson calls a symbolic act. The notion of the symbolic act lets us see the centering of relevance as a creative act of digital marketers who undertake to symbolically resolve a contradiction that cannot otherwise be resolved. Specifically, we suggest that relevance allows marketers to believe that in the age of surveillance capitalism, the manipulation of choice contexts and decision-making is the same as consumer empowerment. Put differently, relevance is the moment when marketing manipulation disappears and all that is left is the empowered consumer. To create relevant manipulations that are experienced as empowering by the consumer requires always-on surveillance, massive analyses of consumer data and hyper-targeted responses, in short, a persistent marketing presence. The vision of digital marketing is therefore a fascinating one: marketing disappears at precisely the moment when it extends throughout the life without limit. © The Author(s) 2020.",algorithmic marketing; artificial intelligence; Big Data; consumer empowerment; digital marketing; hypernudging; manipulation; marketing automation; post-marketing; relevance; surveillance capitalism,,,,,,,,,"https://www.acxiom.com/what-we-are-thinking/open-garden/, (, a) The Open Garden Movement. :, (accessed 2 July 2019; https://www.acxiom.com/what-we-are-thinking/the-new-data-economy/, (, b) The New Data Economy. :, (accessed 8 July 2019; (2015), https://www.acxiom.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Consumer-Data-for-Targeting-Use-Cases-Fact-Sheet-3-31-15.pdf, (,) Acxiom Consumer Data for Targeting. :, (accessed 1 July 2019; Albee, A., (2015) Digital Relevance: Developing Marketing Content and Strategies That Drive Results, , New York, NY, Palgrave MacMillan; Anderson, B., Facing the future enemy: U.S. counterinsurgency doctrine and the pre-insurgent (2011) Theory, Culture & Society, 28 (7-8), pp. 216-240; Andrejevic, M., Theorizing drones and droning theory (2016) Drones and Unmanned Aerial Systems – Legal and Social Implications for Security and Surveillance, pp. 21-43. , Završnik A., (ed), Cham, Springer International Publishing, In:, (ed; Andrejevic, M., To preempt a thief (2017) International Journal of Communication, 11, pp. 879-896; (2018) Itunes Store and Privacy, , https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208477, accessed 15 April 2018; Ardholdt, D.C., Gudergan, S.P., Ringle, C.M., Enhancing loyalty: When improving consumer satisfaction and delight matters (2019) Journal of Business Research, 94 (January), pp. 18-27; Arvidsson, A., Colleoni, E., Value in informational capitalism and on the internet (2012) The Information Society, 28 (3), pp. 135-150; Ball, K., Di Domenico, M., Nunan, D., Big data surveillance and the body-subject (2016) Body & Society, 22 (2), pp. 58-81; Beer, D., Burrows, R., Popular culture, digital archives and the new social life of data (2013) Theory, Culture & Society, 30 (4), pp. 47-71; Bilić, P., Search algorithms, hidden labour and information control (2016) Big Data & Society, 3 (1), pp. 1-9; Bilić, P., A critique of the political economy of algorithms: A brief history of Google’s technological rationality (2018) Triplec: Communication, Capitalism & Critique.

From smart cities to smart forests, digital networks are analyzing and joining up environmental processes. This commentary focuses on one such understudied smart environment, smart forests, as emerging digital infrastructures that are materializing to manage and mitigate environmental change. How does the digitalization of forests not only change understandings of these environments but also generate different practices and ontologies for addressing environmental change? I first analyze smart forests within the expanding area of smart environments, and then discuss five digital practices that characterize smart forests. Based on this analysis, I suggest that forests are not only becoming highly digital environments but also that forests are transforming into technologies for managing environmental change.

They have extensive nationally maintained and centralized health data records, as well as numerous biobanks where data from individuals can be connected based on personal identification numbers. Much of this phenomenon can be attributed to the emergence and development of the Nordic welfare state, where Nordic countries sought to systematically collect large amounts of population data to guide decision making and improve the health and living conditions of the population. Recently, however, the so-called Nordic gold mine of data is being re-imagined in a wholly other context, where data and its ever-increasing logic of accumulation is seen as a driver for economic growth and private business development. This article explores the development of policies and strategies for health data economy in Denmark and Finland. We ask how nation states try to adjust and benefit from new pressures and opportunities to utilize their data resources in data markets. This raises questions of social sustainability in terms of states being producers, providers, and consumers of data. The data imaginaries related to emerging health data markets also provide insight into how a broad range of different data sources, ranging from hospital records and pharmacy prescriptions to biobank sample data, are brought together to enable “full-scale utilization” of health and welfare data. © The Author(s) 2020.",Big data; data imaginary; health data; health policy; Nordic data gold mine; platform economy; sustainability,,,,,,"Academy of Finland: 292408

The rate at which household Intelligent Personal Assistants such as Amazon’s Echo and Google Home emerged in household spaces has been rapid. They have begun to move human–computer interaction from text-based to voice-activated input, offering a multiplicity of features through speech. The supporting infrastructure connects with artificial intelligence and the internet of things, allowing digital interfaces with domestic appliances, lighting systems, thermostats, media devices and more. Yet this also constitutes a significant new production of situated and sensitive data. This study focuses on how (potential) users negotiate and make choices about household Intelligent Personal Assistant use in connection with their data. This study is based on empirical research in Europe with early adopters in Germany and potential users in the Netherlands. This examination of users’ early stage technology acceptance considerations highlights particular practices and choices of users to either preserve their privacy or determine what is acceptable use for their data. Drawing on a simplified version of Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology 2, a quantitative model for technology acceptance, we demonstrate how acceptance of a household Intelligent Personal Assistants does not imply access to all household data, how users see usefulness in relation to a proliferation of devices, and note the recognition by users regarding the efforts needed for full use and acceptance. The study highlights the complexity of data production at a household level and how these devices produce myopic views of users for platforms. © The Author(s) 2020.",Amazon Alexa; Google Home; household Intelligent Personal Assistants; privacy; Smart speakers; surveillance capitalism; Technology Acceptance Models,,,,,,"Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek, NWO: 628.001.024

Yet this argument does not square well with the fact that enrollment into digital systems is often experienced (and presented by companies) as a much more benign process: signing up for a “free” service, responding to a “friend’s” invitation, or being encouraged to “share” content. In this paper, we focus on the centrality of gifting and reciprocity to the business model and cultural imagination of digital capitalism. Relying on historical narratives and in-depth interviews with the designers and critics of digital systems, we explain the cultural genesis of these “give-to-get” relationships and analyze the socio-technical channels that structure them in practice. We suggest that the economic relation that develops as a result of a digital gift offering not only masks the structural asymmetry between giver and gifted but also permits the creation of the new commodity of personal data, obfuscates its true value, and naturalizes its private appropriation. We call this unique regime “accumulation by gift.”. © The Author(s) 2020.",Digital economy; gift economy; personal data; political economy; social theory; sociology,,,,,,"Center for Long-Term Cybersecurity, University of California Berkeley, UC Berkeley Center for Long-Term Cybersecurity","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: The authors thank the UC Berkeley Center for Long-Term Cybersecurity and the UC Berkeley Algorithmic Fairness and Opacity Working Group (AFOG) for funding support.",,"Acquisti, A., Brandimarte, L., Loewenstein, G., Privacy and human behavior in the age of information (2015) Science, 347 (6221), pp. 509-514; Almeling, R., (2011) Sex Cells: The Medical Market for Eggs and Sperm, , Berkeley, University of California Press; Anderson, C., (2009) Free: The Future of a Radical Price, , New York, Hyperion; Anteby, M., Markets, Morals, and Practices of Trade: Jurisdictional Disputes in the U.S. Commerce in Cadavers (2010) Administrative Science Quarterly, 55 (4), pp. 606-638; Arrieta-Ibarra, I., Goff, L., Jiménez-Hernández, D., Should we treat data as labor?

Based on 12 interviews with transport engineers and fieldwork visits to three control rooms, it follows the implementation of Real-Time Passenger Information in Dublin and the various technologies on which it is dependent. It uses the concept of ‘data ratcheting’ to describe how a new data-driven rational order supplants a gradualist, conservative ethos, creating technological dependencies that pressure organisations to take control of their own data and curate accessibility to outside organisations. It is argued that the implementation of Real-Time Passenger Information forms part of a changing landscape of urban technologies as cities move from a phase of opening data silos and expanded communication across departments and with citizens towards one in which new streams of digital data are recognised for their value in stabilising novel forms of city administration. © The Author(s) 2019.",Big Data; Intelligent transport systems; organisational change; real-time information; smart city,,,,,,,"I am indebted to Professor Rob Kitchin for his very helpful feedback and input into this article and research, which formed part of a larger research project on the smart city for which he was principle investigator.

The aim of this approach is to broaden the common analytical focus on algorithms as biased and opaque black boxes, and to instead highlight the many relations that algorithms are interwoven with. Our proposed approach thus highlights how algorithms fold heterogeneous things: data, methods and objects with multiple ethical and political effects. We exemplify the utility of our approach by proposing three specific operations of folding—proximation, universalisation and normalisation. The article develops these three operations through four empirical vignettes, drawn from different settings that deal with algorithms in relation to AIDS, Zika and stock markets. In proposing this analytical approach, we wish to highlight the many different attachments and relations that algorithms enfold. The approach thus aims to produce accounts that highlight how algorithms dynamically combine and reconfigure different social and material heterogeneities as well as the ethical, normative and political consequences of these reconfigurations. © The Author(s) 2019.",Actor-network theory; algorithms; folding; normativities; social theory; theory,,,,,,,,,"Ames, M.G., Deconstructing the algorithmic sublime (2018) Big Data & Society, 5 (1), pp. 1-4; Amoore, L., (2013) The Politics of Possibility: Risk and Security Beyond Probability, , Durham, NC, Duke University Press; Angwin, J., Larson, J., Mattu, S., Machine bias: There’s software used across the country to predict future criminals.

The first, termed the structural programming definition, aligns more with usage in computer science, and as the name suggests, the intellectual project of structured programming. The second, termed the systemic definition, is more informal and emerges from ethnographic observations of discussions of software in both professional and everyday settings. Specific examples of locating algorithms within modern codebases are shared, as well as code directly impacting social and ethical concerns. The structural distinction between algorithms and social concerns is explained as mirroring the engineering construct of algorithms and data structures. It is proposed that, rather than this separation being an attempt to enforce a professional boundary and evade social responsibility, it is a crucial technical distinction within code which makes it clearer and more transparent. The power structures reinforced by the broader, cultural interpretations of algorithm are reconsidered, along with what it would mean for software to have an inclusive design culture. © The Author(s) 2019.",Algorithm; critical algorithm studies; reuse; structured programming; technical culture,,,,,,,"The author thanks Bronwyn Sharman, Dominic Fox, Mohammed Salemy, and Reza Negarastani, who reviewed drafts of this work and provided general support.

The idea that these values should be central to the practice of data science is increasingly gaining traction, yet there is no agreement on what exactly makes data science responsible or sustainable because these concepts prove slippery when applied to a global field involving commercial, academic and governmental actors. This lack of clarity is causing problems in setting goals and boundaries for data scientific practice, and risks fundamental disagreement on governance principles for this emerging field. We will argue in this commentary for a commons analytical framework as one approach to this problem, since it offers useful signposts for how to establish governance principles for shared resources. © The Author(s) 2019.",Commons; data protection; ethics; health; privacy; responsibility,,,,,,"H2020 European Research Council, ERC: 716971

The norm expresses a technical scheme’s becoming as it mutates through, but also resists, inventions. The genealogy of neural networks shall provide a powerful illustration of this dynamic by engaging with their concrete functioning as well as their unsuspected potentialities. The socio-technical normativity accounts for the manners in which engineers, as actors folded into socio-technical networks, willingly or unwittingly, infuse technical objects with values materialized in the system. Surveillance systems’ design will serve here to instantiate the ongoing mediation through which algorithmic systems are endowed with specific capacities. The behavioral normativity is the normative activity, in which both organic and mechanical behaviors are actively participating, undoing the identification of machines with “norm following,” and organisms with “norminstitution”. This proposition productively accounts for the singularity of machine learning algorithms, explored here through the case of recommender systems. The paper will provide substantial discussions of the notions of “normative” by cutting across history and philosophy of science, legal, and critical theory, as well as “algorithmics,” and by confronting our studies led in engineering laboratories with critical algorithm studies. © The Author(s) 2019.",behavioral normativity; Gilbert Simondon; Machine learning; neural networks; socio-technical normativity; technical normativity,,,,,,,"We would like to thank our friends and colleagues Nathan Devos and Fran?ois Thoreau for discussions and criticisms, the two anonymous reviewers that made very productive critiques and suggestions, as well as the editors of this issue, Francis Lee and Lotta Lotta Bj?rklund Larsen.",,"Aggarwal, C.C., (2016) Recommender Systems: The Textbook, , New York, Springer; Barandiaran, X., Egbert, M., Norm-establishing and norm-following (2014) Artificial Life, 20 (1), pp. 5-28; Bates, D., Unity, plasticity, catastrophe: Order and pathology in the cybernetic era (2014) Catastrophe: History and Theory of an Operative Concept, pp. 33-54. , Killen A., Lebovic N., (eds), Berlin, De Gruyter, In:, (eds; Bates, D., Bassiri, N., (2016) Plasticity and Pathology.

Specifically, we look at the Census Hub of the European Statistical System and the Danish Ministry of Education’s Data Warehouse. These portals form part of open government data initiatives, which we understand as governing technologies. We argue that to function as such, aesthetic practices are required so that data produced at dispersed sites can be brought into relation and projected as populations in forms such as bar charts, heat maps and tables. Two examples of aesthetic practices are analysed based on ethnographic studies we have conducted on the production of data for the Hub and Warehouse: metadata and data cleaning. Metadata enables data to come into relation by containing and accounting for (some of) the differences between data. Data cleaning deals with the indeterminacies and absences of data and involves algorithms to determine what values data can obtain so they can be brought into relation. We attend to how both aesthetic practices involve normative decisions that make absent what exceeds them: embodied knowledge that cannot or has not been documented as well as data that cannot meet the forms required of data portals. While these aesthetic practices are necessary to sustain data portals as ‘sites of projection,’ we also bring critical attention to their performative effects for knowing, enacting and governing populations. © The Author(s) 2019.",Aesthetic practice; data cleaning; data portals; embodied knowledge; metadata; open government data,,,,,,,"We are grateful for the criticisms and suggestions of four anonymous peer reviewers and the editors of Big Data & Society.

It is increasingly common to argue that, for instance, algorithms automate inequality, that they are biased black boxes that reproduce racism, or that they control our money and information. Implicit in many of these discussions is that algorithms are permeated with normativities, and that these normativities shape society. The aim of this editorial is double: First, it contributes to a more nuanced discussion about algorithms by discussing how we, as social scientists, think about algorithms in relation to five theoretical ideal types. For instance, what does it mean to go under the hood of the algorithm and what does it mean to stay above it? Second, it introduces the contributions to this special theme by situating them in relation to these five ideal types. By doing this, the editorial aims to contribute to an increased analytical awareness of how algorithms are theorized in society and culture. The articles in the special theme deal with algorithms in different settings, ranging from farming, schools, and self-tracking to AIDS, nuclear power plants, and surveillance. The contributions thus explore, both theoretically and empirically, different settings where algorithms are intertwined with normativities. © The Author(s) 2019.",actor-network theory; algorithms; black boxing; infrastructures; normativities; theory,,,,,,,,,"Amoore, L., (2013) The Politics of Possibility: Risk and Security beyond Probability, , Durham, NC, Duke University Press; Angwin, J., Larson, J., Mattu, S., (2016) Machine Bias: There’s Software Used across the Country to Predict Future Criminals, , www.propublica.org/article/machine-bias-risk-assessments-in-criminal-sentencing, And it’s biased against blacks, (accessed 3 July 2019); Beer, D., Power through the algorithm?

To tackle this crucial issue, the United Nations included the aim to provide legal identity for all by 2030 among the Sustainable Development Goals. Technology can be a powerful tool to reach this target. In the digital age, new technologies increasingly mediate identity verification and identification of individuals. Currently, State-led and public–private initiatives use technology to provide official identification, to control and secure external borders, and to distribute humanitarian aid to populations in need. All of these initiatives have profound implications for the protection of human rights of those affected by them. Digital identity technologies may render individuals without legal documentation more visible and therefore less vulnerable to abuse and exploitation. However, they also present risks for the protection of individuals' human rights. As they build on personal data for identification and identity verification, data protection and privacy rights are most clearly affected. The prohibition of discrimination in the digital space is also of concern as these technological advances' societal impact is not yet fully understood. Accordingly, the article argues that emerging digital identity platforms will only contribute to the protection of human rights if the providers adequately mitigate any risks of potential discrimination and promote high standards of privacy and data protection. © The Author(s) 2019.",Biometric data; blockchain; data protection; digital identity; non-discrimination; privacy,,,,,,,,,"Abraham, R., (2018) State of Aadhaar Report 2017–18, , s.l.: s.n; (2016) Identity for development in Asia and the Pacific, , s.l.: s.n; Beduschi, A., (2018) Technology dominates our lives – That's why we should teach human rights law to software engineers, , https://theconversation.com/technology-dominates-our-lives-thats-why-we-should-teach-human-rights-law-to-software-engineers-102530, Available at:, accessed accessed 30 May 2019; Byler, D., China's hi-tech war on its Muslim minority (2019) The Gardian, , 11 April; (2019) DIACC, , https://diacc.ca//, Available at; (2019) Digital identity programme, , https://www.dta.gov.au/what-we-do/policies-and-programs/identity/, accessed accessed 30 May 2019; (2019) e-identity, , https://e-estonia.com/solutions/e-identity/id-card/, (accessed accessed 30 May 2019); Finck, M., Blockchains and data protection in the European Union (2018) European Data Protection Law Review, 4 (1), pp. 17-35; Fredman, S., Substantive equality revisited (2016) International Journal of Constitutional Law, 14, p. 712; Haenssgen, M.J., Ariana, P., The place of technology in the capability approach (2018) Oxford Development Studies, 46, p. 98; Hu, M., Biometric surveillance and big data governance (2017) The Cambridge Handbook of Surveillance Law, p. 121. , Gray D., Henderson S.E., (eds), Cambridge, Cambridge University Press, In:, (eds; (2019), https://id2020.org/, ID2020 (accessed accessed 30 May 2019); Iuon-Chang, L., Tzu-Chun, L., A survey of blockchain security issues and challenges (2017) International Journal of Network Security, 19 (5), pp. 653-659; (2017) Digital Identity and Privacy, , s.l.: s.n; Rachovitsa, A., Engineering and lawyering privacy by design: Understanding online privacy both as a technical and an international human rights issue (2016) International Journal of Law and Information Technology, 24, p. 374; Rebera, A.P., Guihen, B., Societal and ethical factors in biometrics and ageing (2012) Proceeding International Conference of the Biometrics Special Interest Group, , Darmstadt, Germany, 6-7 September 2012; (2018) A Rohingya initiative, , http://rohingyaproject.com/, (accessed accessed 30 May 2019); Schartum, D.W., Making privacy by design operative (2016) International Journal of Law and Information Technology, 24, p. 151; Schwartz, P.M., Solove, D.J., The PII problem: Privacy and a new concept of personally identifiable information (2011) New York University Law Review, 86, p. 1814; Sen, A., (1992) Inequality Re-examined, , Oxford, Oxford University Press; Sen, A., Human rights and capabilities (2005) Journal of Human Development, 6, p. 151; Singer, P.W., Friedman, A., (2014) Cybersecurity: What Everyone Needs to Know, , Oxford, Oxford University Press; Sullivan, C., Digital citizenship and the right to digital identity under international law (2016) Computer Law & Security Review, 32, p. 474; Sullivan, C., Digital identity.

They seem to be everywhere, yet they are seldom seen by the humans dealing with the consequences that result from them. Yet, in recent theorisations, there is a risk that the algorithm is being given too much prominence. This article addresses the interaction between algorithmic outputs and the humans engaging with them by drawing on studies of two distinct empirical fields – self-quantification and audit controls of taxpayers. We explore recalibration as a way to understand the practices and processes involved when, on the one hand, decisions are made based on results from algorithmic calculations in counting and accounting software, and on the other hand, when decisions are made based on human experience/knowledge. In particular, we are concerned with moments when an algorithmic output differs from expectations of ‘normalcy’ and ‘normativity’ in any given situation. This could be a ‘normal’ relation between sales and VAT deductions for a business, or a ‘normal’ number of steps one takes in a day, or ‘normative’ as it is according to the book, following guidelines and recommendations from other sources. In these moments, we argue that a process of recalibration occurs – an effortful moment where, rather than treat the algorithmic output as given, individuals’ tacit knowledge, experiences and intuition are brought into play to address the deviation from the normal and normative. © The Author(s) 2019.",accounting; algorithmic output; Algorithms; normativity; quantified self; recalibration,,,,,,,,,"Bateson, G., (1972) Steps to an Ecology of Mind: Collected Essays in Anthropology Psychiatry Evolution and Epistemology, , Chicago, IL, Chicago University Press; Björklund Larsen, L., (2017) Shaping Taxpayers.

Data-based systems, however, do not come from nowhere. They are designed and brought into being within social spaces – or social milieu. This paper connects philosophical considerations of individual and collective capacity to enact practical reason to the influence of social spaces. Building a deeper engagement with the social imaginaries of technology development through analysis of two years of fieldwork with start-ups working on Internet of Things, this paper suggests that different action positions can emerge, with consequences for how data is understood and valued. The Disengaged, Pragmatist and Idealist ethical action positions identified in the paper reveal the ways individuals and groups negotiate possibilities for ethical action, through justifications, explanations and structuring of system features. © The Author(s) 2019.",ethics; Internet of Things; responsible technology; social milieu; virtue ethics,,,,,,727040,"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: The VIRT-EU project has received funding from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Programme (Grant Agreement No: 727040).",,"Modern moral philosophy (1958) Philosophy, 33 (124), pp. 1-16; Anscombe, G.E.M., Human life, action and ethics (2005) St. Andrews Studies in Philosophy and Public Affairs, , Geach M and Gormally L, Exeter: Imprint Academic; Astor, M., Your roomba may be mapping your home, collecting data that could be shared (2017) The New York Times, , www.nytimes.com/2017/07/25/technology/roomba-irobot-data-privacy.html, 25 July; Berdichevsky, D., Neuenschwander, E., Toward an ethics of persuasive technology (1999) Communications of the ACM, 42 (5), pp. 51-58; Braman, S., The interpenetration of technical and legal decision-making for the internet (2010) Information, Communication & Society, 13 (3), pp. 309-324; Castoriadis, C., (1997) The Imaginary Institution of Society, , Cambridge, MIT Press; Chowdhury, H., Tech for good (2017) Investors Find they Can also Make Good Returns.

This article explores the role of data governing institutions during a reform of both secondary health data infrastructure and related legislation in Finland. The analysis elaborates on recent conceptual work on data journeys and data frictions, connecting them to institutional and regulatory issues. The study employs an interpretative approach, using interview and document data. The results show the stark contrast between the goals of open and Big Data inspired reforms and the existing institutional realities. The multiple tensions that emerged during the process indicate how data frictions emanate to the institutional level, and how mundane data practices and institutional dynamics are intertwined. The article argues that in the Finnish case, public institutions acted as sage-guards of public interest, preventing more controversial parts from passing. Finally, it argues that initiating regulatory and infrastructural reforms simultaneously was beneficial for solving the tensions of the initiative and analysing either side separately would have produced misleading accounts of the overall initiative. The results highlight the benefits of analysing institutional dynamics and data practices as connected issues. © The Author(s) 2019.",Data friction; data journey; Finland; healthcare; infrastructure; institutions,,,,,,,"I would like to thank Eric T Meyer for his support in the project and feedback on earlier versions of the article, and Finnish Innovation Fund SITRA for opportunities to present and discuss the findings.

This special theme examines and ultimately rejects the familiar grand claims of datafication, to instead pay attention to emergent conversations that seek to take a more nuanced stock of the status and nature of datafied knowledge production. The articles in this special theme thus engage with datafied knowledge production through elaborate explorations of how datafied knowledge depends on the contexts of its production and the forms of knowledge production that precede it in those contexts. Our basic argument is that while the resources, material features and analytical operations involved in datafied knowledge production may be different, many fundamental concerns about epistemology, ontology and methods remain relevant to understand what shapes it. We still need to understand and explicate the assumptions, operations and consequences of emergent forms of knowledge production. If datafied knowledge production is neither a clean revolutionary break with past forms of knowledge production nor a balloon of pure hype, the articles in this special theme ask: what does the phenomenon of datafied knowledge production look like? Which digital and datafied infrastructures support its future development? And what potentialities and limits do such forms of analysis and knowledge production contain? © The Author(s) 2019.",Black box; datafication; infrastructure; knowledge production; literacy; transformation,,,,,,,,,"Agostinho, D., Thylstrup, N., ‘If Truth was a woman’: Leaky infrastructures and the gender politics of truth-telling (2019) Ephemera, 19 (4); Alaimo, C., Kallinikos, J., Computing the everyday: Social media as data platforms (2017) Information Society, 33 (4), pp. 175-191; Anand, N., (2017) Hydraulic City Water and the Infrastructures of Citizenship in Mumbai, , Durham, NC, Duke University Press; Anderson, C., The end of theory: The data deluge makes the scientiﬁc method obsolete (2008) Wired, , www.wired.com/2008/06/pb-theory/, 23 June, Available at:, accessed 1 August 2019; Bowker, G., Leigh Star, S., (1999) Sorting Things Out: Classification and Its Consequences, , Cambridge, MA, MIT Press; boyd, D., Crawford, K., Critical questions for big data: Provocations for a cultural, technological, and scholarly phenomenon (2012) Information, Communication and Society, 15 (5), pp. 662-679; Bucher, T., Neither black nor box: Ways of knowing algorithms (2016) Innovative Methods in Media and Communication Research, , Kubitschko S., Kaun A., (eds), Cham, Palgrave Macmillan, In:, (eds; Chun, W.H.K., Keenan, T., (2006) New Media, Old Media: Interrogating the Digital Revolution, , London, Routledge; Czarniawska, B., (1998) A Narrative Approach to Organization Studies, , Thousand Oaks, CA, Sage; Desrosières, A., (1993) The Politics of Large Numbers: A History of Statistical Reasoning, , Cambridge, MA, Harvard University Press; Edwards, P.N., (2010) A Vast Machine: Computer Models, Climate Data, and the Politics of Global Warming, , Cambridge, MA, MIT Press; Flyverbom, M., Madsen, A.K., Sorting data out: Unpacking big data value chains and algorithmic knowledge production (2015) Die Gesellschaft der Daten: Über die digitale Transformation der sozialen Ordnung, pp. 123-144. , Süssenguth F., (ed), Bielefeld, Transcript Verlag, In:, (ed; Geiger, R.S., Beyond opening up the black box: Investigating the role of algorithmic systems in Wikipedian organizational culture (2017) Big Data & Society, 4 (2). , https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/2053951717730735, Epub ahead of print 2017; Gitelman, L., (2013) Raw Data’ is an Oxymoron, , Cambridge, MA, MIT Press; Helles, R., Flyverbom, M., Meshes of surveillance, prediction, and infrastructure: On the cultural and commercial consequences of digital platforms (2019) Surveillance and Society, 17 (1-2), pp. 34-39; Kitchin, R., (2014) The Data Revolution: Big Data, Open Data, Data Infrastructures and Their Consequences, , London, Sage; Noble, S., Roberts, S.T., Out of the black box (2017) .

Meanwhile, parallel concerns about surveillance practices have already led to multiple successful regulatory efforts of surveillance technologies—many of which have algorithmic components. Here, we examine municipal surveillance regulation as offering lessons for algorithmic oversight. Taking the 2017 Seattle Surveillance Ordinance as our primary case study and surveying efforts across five other cities, we describe the features of existing surveillance regulation; including procedures for describing surveillance technologies in detail, requirements for public engagement, and processes for establishing acceptable uses. Although the Seattle Surveillance Ordinance was not intended to address algorithmic accountability, we find these considerations to be relevant to the law’s aim of surfacing disparate impacts of systems in use. We also find that in notable cases government employees did not identify regulated algorithmic surveillance technologies as reliant on algorithmic or machine learning systems, highlighting definitional gaps that could hinder future efforts toward algorithmic regulation. We argue that (i) finer-grained distinctions between types of information systems in the language of law and policy, and (ii) risk assessment tools integrated into their implementation would strengthen future regulatory efforts by rendering underlying algorithmic components more legible and accountable to political and community stakeholders. © The Author(s) 2019.",Accountability; algorithmic systems; ethnography; government; policy; surveillance,,,,,,"Washington Research Foundation, WRF

Following the history of a highly popular Russian-language forum, I demonstrate how this online community gets imbricated into communicative biocapitalism – a neoliberal logic that commodifies the voice of an online user, turning networked publics into markets for medical services. Adding to the literature on data colonialism, I explore a case in which data-driven algorithms effectively alter geographical distribution of reproductive bodies, outsourcing the production of new generations of neoliberal subjects through regimes of technological mediation. © The Author(s) 2019.",birth; citizenship; data colonialism; Maternity tourism; Russia; United States,,,,,,,"I am grateful to the editors, Agnieszka Leszczynski and Matthew Zook, and to three anonymous reviewers for their excellent suggestions that have been a source of inspiration for revising and completing this article.

The idea that we leak, drop and leave traces wherever we go has given rise to a culture of traceability, and this culture of traceability, I argue, is intimately entangled with a socio-economics of data disposability and recycling. While the culture of traceability has often been theorised in terms of, and in relation to, privacy, I offer another approach, framing digital traces instead as a question of waste. This perspective, I argue, allows us to connect to, extend and nuance existing discussions of digital traces. It shows us that data traces raise questions about not only how data capitalism tracks individual and multiple data behaviours, but also how it links to social and environmental toxicities in the form of abuse and environmental pollution, which follow gendered and colonial structures of violence. © The Author(s) 2019.",Big Data ecologies; Digital traces; knowledge production; recycling; toxic data; waste,,,,,,,"I gratefully acknowledge the support and generosity of Danish Research Council’s YDUN programme, without which the present article could not have been completed and Mer Storr’s wonderful and always attentive proof-reading, without which the article would not have been readable.

We contend that with increased algorithmic complexity, biases will become more sophisticated and difficult to identify, control for, or contest. Our argument has four steps: first, we show how harnessing algorithms means that data gathered at a particular place and time relating to specific persons, can be used to build group models applied in different contexts to different persons. Thus, privacy and data protection rights, with their focus on individuals (Coll, 2014; Parsons, 2015), do not protect from the discriminatory potential of algorithmic profiling. Second, we explore the idea that anti-discrimination regulation may be more promising, but acknowledge limitations. Third, we argue that in order to harness anti-discrimination regulation, it needs to confront emergent forms of discrimination or risk creating new invisibilities, including invisibility from existing safeguards. Finally, we outline suggestions to address emergent forms of discrimination and exclusionary invisibilities via intersectional and post-colonial analysis. © The Author(s) 2019.",Algorithms; data protection; discrimination; General Data Protection Regulation; intersectionality; profiling,,,,,,"Queensland University of Technology, QUT","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: Monique Mann received funding as part of her Vice-Chancellor's Research Fellowship (Technology and Regulation) at QUT.",,"Adey, P., Borders, identification and surveillance (2012) Routledge Handbook of Surveillance Studies, pp. 193-201. , Lyon D., Ball K., Haggerty K.D., (eds), London, Routledge, In:, (eds; Amoore, L., Data derivatives: On the emergence of a security risk calculus for our times (2011) Theory, Culture and Society, 28 (6), pp. 24-43; https://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/article29/item-detail.cfm?item_id=612053, Guidelines on automated individual decision-making and profiling for the purposes of regulation 2016/679. :, (accessed 25 November 2019; https://ec.europa.eu/justice/article-29/documentation/opinion-recommendation/index_en.htm, Opinion 4/2007 on the concept of personal data; 01248/07/EN WP136. :, (accessed 25 November 2019; https://ec.europa.eu/justice/article-29/documentation/opinion-recommendation/index_en.htm, Opinion 5/2014 on anonymization techniques 0829/14/EN/WP216 :, (accessed 25 November 2019; Bano, M., (2018), https://www.kcl.ac.uk/news/news-article.aspx?id=c97f7c12-ae02-4394-8f84-31ba4d56ddf7, (,) Artificial intelligence is demonstrating gender bias – And it’s our fault.

The influential sociologist, Pierre Bourdieu, demonstrated that cultural taste – what and how people consume cultural goods, such as music, food and fashion – is shaped by class background and in doing so serves to mark and reproduce class differences in everyday life. In this commentary, I consider how sociologists might address the important but challenging question of if and how are music streaming platforms shaping the part that music taste plays in the performance of class identities and the cultural reproduction of class privilege. I discuss some ways in which music streaming platforms may be shaping how class identities are performed through how people consume music, drawing attention to consumption practices that have the potential to both involve and resist the use of music streaming platforms in the pursuit of social distinction. © The Author(s) 2019.",Class identities; consumption; distinction; music streaming services; platformisation; taste,,,,,,"University of Southampton: EP/LO16117/1

Looking at how individuals and groups engage with datafication, it complements the notion of “data politics” by exploring what we call the “contentious politics of data”. By contentious politics of data we indicate the bottom-up, transformative initiatives interfering with and/or hijacking dominant processes of datafication, contesting existing power relations or re-appropriating data practices and infrastructure for purposes distinct from the intended. Said contentious politics of data is articulated in an array of practices of data activism taking a critical stance towards datafication. In data activism, data as mediators take a central role, both as part of an action repertoire or as objects of struggle in their own right. Leveraging social movement studies and science and technology studies, this theoretical essay argues that data activism can be mapped along two analytical dimensions: “data as stakes” (as issues and/or objects of political struggle in their own right) vs. “data as repertoires” (or modular tools for political struggle), and “individual practice vs. collective action”. Mapping action repertoires and tactics along these axes allows us to chart the potential emergence of a political (contentious) data subject at the intersection of these two dimensions. This furthers our understanding of people’s engagement with data in relation to other forms of activism and existing work in social movement studies. It also helps us interpreting potential trajectories of contemporary social movements, as they increasingly interface with data, devices and platforms. © The Author(s) 2019.",agency; contentious politics of data; data activism; Data politics; data practices; science and technology studies; social movement studies,,,,,,"European Research Council, ERC

In this commentary, we argue that we cannot stop at denouncing the lack of accountability for algorithms and their effects but must engage the broader systems and distributed agencies that algorithmic systems exist within; including standards, regulations, technologies, and social relations. To this end, we explore accountability in “the Generated Detective,” an algorithmically generated comic. Taking up the mantle of detectives ourselves, we investigate accountability in relation to this piece of experimental fiction. We problematize efforts to effect accountability through transparency by undertaking a simple operation: asking for permission to re-publish a set of the algorithmically selected and modified words and images which make the frames of the comic.

Crime prediction machines are used by governments to shape the moral behavior of police. They serve not only to predict when and where crime is likely to occur, but also to regulate police work. They calculate equivalence ratios, distributing security across the territory based on multiple cost and social justice criteria. Tracing the origins of predictive policing in the Compstat system, this article studies the shift from machines to explore intuitions (where police officers still have control over the machine) to applications removing the reflexive dimension of proactivity, thus turning prediction into the medium for “dosage” metrics of police work quantities. Finally, the article discusses how, driven by a critical movement denouncing the discriminatory biases of predictive machines, developers seek to develop techniques to audit training dataset and ways to calculate the reasonable amount of stop and frisk over the population. © The Author(s) 2019.",algorithm; big data; Compstat; Predictive policing,,,,,,"Agence Nationale de la Recherche, ANR: INOV2013",,,"Bambauer, J., Hassle (2014) Michigan Law Review, 113, p. 461; Bellin, J., The inverse relationship between the constitutionality and effectiveness of New York City stop and frisk (2014) Boston University Law Review, 94, p. 1495; Benbouzid, B., Des crimes et des séismes (2017) Réseaux, 206, pp. 95-123; Brantingham, P.J., The logic of data bias and its impact on place-based predictive policing (2017) Ohio State Journal of Criminal Law, 15, p. 473; Brantingham, P.J., Valasik, M., Mohler, G.O., Does predictive policing lead to biased arrests?

In particular, we consider the ways in which artists such as Zach Blas, Adam Harvey and Sterling Crispin design artworks to consider and critique the algorithmic normativities that materialize in facial recognition technologies. Many of the artworks we consider center on the face, and use either camouflage technology or forms of masking to counter the surveillance effects of recognition technologies. Analyzing their works, we argue they on the one hand reiterate and reify a modernist conception of the self when they conjure and imagination of Big Brother surveillance. Yet on the other hand, their emphasis on masks and on camouflage also moves beyond such more conventional critiques of algorithmic normativities, and invites reflection on ways of relating to technology beyond the affirmation of the liberal, privacy-obsessed self. In this way, and in particular by foregrounding the relational modalities of the mask and of camouflage, we argue academic observers of algorithmic recognition technologies can find inspiration in artistic algorithmic imaginaries. © The Author(s) 2019.",algorithmic anxiety; camouflage; Identity recognition technology; Kierkegaard; masks; self,,,,,,,,,"Blas, Z., Informatic opacity (2014) The Journal of Aesthetics & Protest, , http://www.joaap.org/issue9/zachblas.html; Blas, Z., Infomatic opacity (2016) The Black Chamber: Surveillance, Paranoia, Invisibility & the Internet, pp. 40-51. , Brescia, Link Editions & Ljubljana.

To fill this gap, we need in-depth analyses of social media use in those contexts and to create detailed maps of online public environments in such societies. This paper aims to present such cartography of the political landscape of Persian Twitter by studying the case of Iran's 2013 presidential election. The objective of this study is twofold: first, to fill the empirical gap in our knowledge about Twitter use in Iran, and second, to develop computational methods for studying Persian Twitter (e.g., effective methods for analyzing Persian text) and identify the best methods for addressing different issues (e.g., topic detection and sentiment analysis). During Iran's 2013 presidential election, three million tweets were collected and analyzed using social network analysis and machine learning. The findings provide a more nuanced view of the political landscape of Persian Twitter and identify patterns in accordance with or in contrast to those identified in the English-speaking Twittersphere around the 2013 presidential election. Persian Twitter was dominated by micro-celebrities, whereas institutional elites dominated English discourse about Iran on Twitter. The results also illustrate that Persian Twitter in 2013 was predominantly in favor of reformists. Finally, this study demonstrates that sentiment analysis toward political name entities can be used efficiently for mapping the political landscape of conversation on Twitter. © The Author(s) 2019.",Big Data; computational methods; Iran; political landscape; social network analysis; Twitter,,,,,,,,,"Anstead, N., Chadwick, A., A primary definer online: The construction and propagation of a think tank's authority on social media (2018) Media, Culture & Society, 40 (2), pp. 246-266; Arnaboldi, V., Conti, M., La Gala, M., Information diffusion in OSNs: The impact of Nodes' sociality (2014) In:Proceedings of the 29th annual ACM symposium on applied computing, , (ed.

Our analysis suggests that a minimum of 1.4 billion users will pass away before 2100 if Facebook ceases to attract new users as of 2018. If the network continues expanding at current rates, however, this number will exceed 4.9 billion. In both cases, a majority of the profiles will belong to non-Western users. In discussing our findings, we draw on the emerging scholarship on digital preservation and stress the challenges arising from curating the profiles of the deceased. We argue that an exclusively commercial approach to data preservation poses important ethical and political risks that demand urgent consideration. We call for a scalable, sustainable, and dignified curation model that incorporates the interests of multiple stakeholders. © The Author(s) 2019.",Death online; digital afterlife; digital preservation; ethics; Facebook; mortality,,,,,,"Facebook, FB",We wish to express our sincere gratitude to the four referees who reviewed this study.

This paper presents an experiment in moving such methods into critical proximity with political practice and discusses how digital visualizations of topical debates become appropriated by actors and hardwired into existing ecologies of publics and politics. Through an experiment in rendering a specific data-public visible, it shows how the interplay between diverse conceptions of the public as well as the specific platforms and data invoked, resulted in a situated affordance-space that allowed specific renderings take shape, while disadvantaging others. Furthermore, it argues that several accepted tropes in the literatures of digital methods ended up being problematic guidelines in this space. Among these is the prescription to shown heterogeneity by pushing back at established media logics. © The Author(s) 2019.",controversy-mapping; critical proximity; Digital methods; multiplicity; pragmatism; public engagement,,,,,,,,,"Birkbak, A., Petersen, M.K., Elgaard Jensen, T., Critical proximity as a methodological move in techno-anthropology (2015) Techné: Research in Philosophy and Technology, 19 (2), pp. 266-290; Callon, An essay on framing and overflowing: Economic externalities revisited by sociology (1998) The Laws of Markets, pp. 244-269. , Callon M., (ed), Oxford, Blackwell, In:, (ed; Dewey, (1927) The Public and its Problems, , New York, NY, H.

On top of the built infrastructures in cities, application programming interfaces allow to weave new kinds of seams from static and dynamic data sources into the urban fabric. Contributing to debates about “urban informatics” and the governance of urban information infrastructures, this article provides a technically informed and critically grounded approach to evaluating APIs as crucial but often overlooked elements within these infrastructures. The conceptualization of what we term City APIs is informed by three perspectives: In the first part, we review established criticisms of proprietary social media APIs and their crucial function in current web architectures. In the second part, we discuss how the design process of APIs defines conventions of data exchanges that also reflect negotiations between API producers and API consumers about affordances and mental models of the underlying computer systems involved. In the third part, we present recent urban data innovation initiatives, especially CitySDK and OrganiCity, to underline the centrality of API design and governance for new kinds of civic and commercial services developed within and for cities. By bridging the fields of criticism, design, and implementation, we argue that City APIs as elements of infrastructures reveal how urban renewal processes become crucial sites of socio-political contestation between data science, technological development, urban management, and civic participation. © The Author(s) 2019.",Application Programming Interface (API); infrastructure; interface design; Internet of Things (IoT); smart city; social urban data,,,,,,,,,"Aguilera, U., Peña, O., Belmonte, O., Citizen-centric data services for smarter cities (2017) Future Generation Computer Systems, 76, pp. 234-247; Asad, M., Dantec, C.A.L., Nielsen, B., Creating a sociotechnical API: Designing city-scale community engagement (2017) Proceedings from CHI, , 6–11 May; Ash, J., (2015) The Interface Envelope: Gaming, Technology, Power, , New York, Bloomsbury Academic; Ash, J., Anderson, B., Gordon, R., Unit, vibration, tone: A post-phenomenological method for researching digital interfaces (2018) Cultural Geographies, 25 (1), pp. 165-181; Balijepally, V., Nerur, S., Mahapatra, R., Effect of task mental models on software developer’s performance: An experimental investigation (2012) The 45Th Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences, pp. 5442-5451. , Maui; Barbosa, L., Pham, K., Silva, C., Structured open urban data: Understanding the landscape (2014) Big Data, 2 (3), pp. 144-154; Barns, S., Mine your data: Open data, digital strategies and entrepreneurial governance by code (2015) Urban Geography, 37 (4), pp. 554-571; Batty, M., (2013) The New Science of Cities, , Cambridge, MIT Press; Bechmann, A., Internet profiling: The economy of data intraoperability on facebook and google (2013) MedieKultur, 29 (55), pp. 72-91; Beer, D., (2011) The Philosophy of Software.

Funders, institutions, and specialist organizations are developing and implementing strategies to encourage or mandate data sharing within and across disciplines, with varying degrees of success. Academic journals in ecology and evolution have adopted several types of public data archiving policies requiring authors to make data underlying scholarly manuscripts freely available. The effort to increase data sharing in the sciences is one part of a broader “data revolution” that has prompted discussion about a paradigm shift in scientific research. Yet anecdotes from the community and studies evaluating data availability suggest that these policies have not obtained the desired effects, both in terms of quantity and quality of available datasets. We conducted a qualitative, interview-based study with journal editorial staff and other stakeholders in the academic publishing process to examine how journals enforce data archiving policies. We specifically sought to establish who editors and other stakeholders perceive as responsible for ensuring data completeness and quality in the peer review process. Our analysis revealed little consensus with regard to how data archiving policies should be enforced and who should hold authors accountable for dataset submissions. Themes in interviewee responses included hopefulness that reviewers would take the initiative to review datasets and trust in authors to ensure the completeness and quality of their datasets. We highlight problematic aspects of these thematic responses and offer potential starting points for improvement of the public data archiving process. © The Author(s) 2019.",data infrastructures; data policy; Open data; public data archiving; public data archiving policies; scholarly publishing,,,,,,"University of California, Berkeley Foundation, UCBF","We would like to thank the interview participants who graciously volunteered their time to be interviewed for our study.

We explore what this requirement entails for artificial intelligence and automated decision-making systems. We address the topic of transparency in artificial intelligence by integrating legal, social, and ethical aspects. We first investigate the ratio legis of the transparency requirement in the General Data Protection Regulation and its ethical underpinnings, showing its focus on the provision of information and explanation. We then discuss the pitfalls with respect to this requirement by focusing on the significance of contextual and performative factors in the implementation of transparency. We show that human–computer interaction and human-robot interaction literature do not provide clear results with respect to the benefits of transparency for users of artificial intelligence technologies due to the impact of a wide range of contextual factors, including performative aspects. We conclude by integrating the information- and explanation-based approach to transparency with the critical contextual approach, proposing that transparency as required by the General Data Protection Regulation in itself may be insufficient to achieve the positive goals associated with transparency. Instead, we propose to understand transparency relationally, where information provision is conceptualized as communication between technology providers and users, and where assessments of trustworthiness based on contextual factors mediate the value of transparency communications. This relational concept of transparency points to future research directions for the study of transparency in artificial intelligence systems and should be taken into account in policymaking. © The Author(s) 2019.",Artificial intelligence; automated decision-making; ethics; general data protection regulation; HRI; human– computer interaction; transparency,,,,,,"Norges Forskningsråd: 247725

We take the case of national precision medicine initiatives as an illustrative example of this possible tendency. Precision medicine pools together unprecedented amounts of genetic as well as phenotypic data. The possibility that private insurers could claim access to such rapidly accumulating biomedical Big Data or to health-related information derived from it would discourage people from enrolling in precision medicine studies. Should that be the case, the economic value of personal data for the insurance industry would end up affecting the public value of data as a scientific resource.

The pervasiveness of connected devices is expanding the types of information that are defined as ‘health data.’ Additionally, cloud-based mechanisms for data collection and distribution are shifting biomedical research away from traditional infrastructure towards a more distributed and interconnected ecosystem. This shift provides an opportunity for us to reimagine the roles of scientists and participants in health research, with the potential to more meaningfully engage in partnership across the research process. At the same time, these emerging practices present a potential to expose research participants to unanticipated and unintended consequences. Social norms and policy can help to mitigate these risks, but their development is often slow relative to the pace of technological advances and, as such, they can become reactive rather than prospective. As an alternative, the integrated development of data governance structures within technological advancements, supports their effective implementation, evaluation and evolution in a manner that can balance the benefits and risks of biomedical researcher in a decentralized ecosystem. © The Author(s) 2019.",biomedical research; cloud computing; Decentralization; governance,,,,,,,,,"Agrawal, A., Ostrom, E., Collective action, property rights, and decentralization in resource use in India and Nepal (2001) Politics & Society, 29 (4), pp. 485-514; Allaway, R., Angus, S.P., Beauchamp, R.L., Traditional and systems biology based drug discovery for the rare tumor syndrome neurofibromatosis type 2 (2018) PLOS ONE, 13 (6). , Lebedeva IV (ed.), Public Library of Science (PLoS); Bot, B.M., Suver, C., Neto, E.C., The mPower study, Parkinson disease mobile data collected using ResearchKit (2016) Scientific Data, , 3.

Known as precision agriculture, the integration of digital management and surveillance technologies in farming is normatively presented as a revolutionary transformation. Proponents contend that machine learning, Big Data, and automation will create more accurate, efficient, transparent, and environmentally friendly food production, staving off both food insecurity and ecological ruin. This article contributes a critique of these rhetorical and discursive claims to a growing body of critical literature on precision agriculture. It argues precision agriculture is less a revolution than an evolution, an effort to shore up and intensify the conventional farming system responsible for generating many of the social and environmental problems precision agriculture is presented as solving. While precision agriculture advocates portray it as a radical, even democratic epistemological break with the past, this paper locates truth claims surrounding datafication and algorithmic control in farming within deeper historical contexts of the capitalist rationalization of production and efforts to quantify and automate physical and mental labor. Abjuring the growing cultural tendency to treat algorithmic systems as revolutionary in favor of social and historical dimensions of precision agriculture, can help re-frame the discussion about its design and use around real, socially and ecologically oriented change in farming, and so ensure that the possibilities and benefits of precision agriculture are as evenly and effectively shared as possible. © The Author(s) 2019.",algorithm; capitalism; digitization; normativity; Precision agriculture; rationality,,,,,,,,,"Balmford, A., Green, R., Phalan, B., What conservationists need to know about farming (2012) Proceedings: Biological Sciences, 279 (1739), pp. 2714-2724; Boyd, D., Crawford, K., Critical questions for Big Data: Provocations for a cultural, technological, and scholarly phenomenon (2012) Information, Communication & Society, 15 (5), pp. 662-679; Bronson, K., Knezevic, I., Big Data in food and agriculture.

But personal data is also highly valuable to corporations and states, triggering moves to unlock its insights by relocating it in the cloud. We characterise this twinned condition as ‘clouded data’. Clouded data constructs a political and technological notion of privacy that operates through the intersection of corporate power, computational resources and the ability to obfuscate, gain insights from and valorise a dependency between public and private. First, we survey prominent clouded data approaches (blockchain, multiparty computation, differential privacy, and homomorphic encryption), suggesting their particular affordances produce distinctive versions of privacy. Next, we perform two notional code-based experiments using synthetic datasets. In the field of health, we submit a patient’s blood pressure to a notional cloud-based diagnostics service; in education, we construct a student survey that enables aggregate reporting without individual identification. We argue that these technical affordances legitimate new political claims to capture and commodify personal data. The final section broadens the discussion to consider the political force of clouded data and its reconstitution of traditional notions such as the public and the private. © The Author(s) 2019.",blockchain; cloud-computation; Encryption; homomorphic; personal data; privacy,,,,,,"University of Western Sydney, UWS","The authors wish to acknowledge the generous support of Dr Laurence Park, of Western Sydney University, and Justin Evans and Tamir Levin of Dimension Data, who provided technical assistance with the San-Shi experiment.

Yet, it has proven difficult to bring these important insights into the practice of data science itself. We suggest that part of this problem has to do with under-examined or unacknowledged assumptions about the relationship between the two fields—ideas about how data science and its critics can and should relate. Inspired by recent work in Science and Technology Studies on interventions, we attempted to stage an encounter in which practicing data scientists were asked to analyze a corpus of critical social science literature about their work, using tools of textual analysis such as co-word and topic modelling. The idea was to provoke discussion both about the content of these texts and the possible limits of such analyses. In this commentary, we reflect on the planning stages of the experiment and how responses to the exercise, from both data scientists and qualitative social scientists, revealed some of the tensions and interactions between the normative positions of the different fields. We argue for further studies which can help us understand what these interdisciplinary tensions turn on—which do not paper over them but also do not take them as given. © The Author(s) 2019.",Algorithms; data science; interdisciplinarity; intervention; reflexivity; Science and Technology Studies,,,,,,"Laboratory of Algorithms and Technologies for Networks Analysis, LATNA","The authors would like to thank our data science interlocutors, the Algorithms Network for prompting this experiment (and participating in it) and the Values group at Link?ping University for helpful feedback on an earlier version of the text.

While the persistence of optics seems to be at odds with the datafication of vision, this article suggests that the optical metaphor offers an opportunity to reflect about the material consequences of the modes of seeing and knowing that currently shape datafied worlds. Drawing on feminist new materialism, the article investigates the optical metaphor as a material-discursive practice that actively constitutes the world, as metaphors imply modes of thinking, knowing and doing that have material enactions. Expanding visual culture theories, the notion of ‘optical unconscious’ is taken up to discuss the tensions between displacement and persistence of optics within datafied worlds, that is, how optical vision is displaced but also mobilised and repurposed by data-driven knowledge. In dialogue with feminist science and technology studies and speculative ethics, I suggest that the datafication of vision offers a chance to reconceptualize the sense of sight towards a sensorial engagement with Big Data premised on responsibility, care, and an ethics of unknowability. Within this framework, vision may be conceived differently, perhaps not only as enhancement and control, but as generator of new possibilities. Ultimately, the article proposes that the visual theories after which Big Data is being imagined matter not only for our understanding of Big Data's epistemic potential, but also for the possibility of shaping emerging data worlds. © The Author(s) 2019.",care; datafication of vision; feminist materialism; metaphors; Optical unconscious; speculative ethics,,,,,,,,,"Ahmed, S., This other and other others (2010) Economy and Society, 31 (4), pp. 558-572; Alaimo, S., Hekman, S., (2008) Material Feminisms, , Bloomington, Indiana University Press; Alexander, E., Can you be BLACK and Look at This?”: Reading the Rodney King Video(s) (1994) Public Culture, 7, pp. 77-94; Barad, K., Posthumanist performativity: Toward an understanding of how matter comes to matter (2003) Signs: Journal of Women in Culture and Society, 28 (3), pp. 801-831; Barad, K., (2007) Meeting the Universe Halfway.

Our goal is to examine selected features of the enactment of datafication and, hence, to open up what has widely remained a black box for most education researchers. Our findings are based on interviews conducted in three state education agencies in two different national contexts (the US and Germany), thus addressing the question of how the datafication and digitalisation of school governance has not only manifested within but also across educational contexts and systems. As our findings illustrate, the implementation of data-based school monitoring and leadership in state education agencies appears as a complex entanglement of very different logics, practices and problems, producing both new capabilities and powers. Nonetheless, by identifying different types of ‘doing data discrepancies’ reported by our interviewees, we suggest an analytical heuristic to better understand at least some features of the multifaceted enactment of data-based, increasingly digitalised governance, within and beyond the field of education. © The Author(s) 2019.",Data-based governance; digitalisation; education; Germany; state education agencies; US,,,,,,"Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG: HA 7367/2-1",,,"Anagnostopoulos, D., Jacobsen, R., Rutledge, A., (2013) The Infrastructure of Accountability.

A growing number of scholars see digital data and information commons as a way to counteract this asymmetry. In this paper I raise two concerns with this argument: First, because digital data and information can be in more than one place at once, governance models for physical common-pool resources cannot be easily transposed to digital commons. Second, not all data and information commons are suitable to address power differentials. In order to create digital commons that effectively address power asymmetries we must pay more systematic attention to the issue of exclusion from digital data and information commons. Why and how digital data and information commons exclude, and what the consequences of such exclusion are, decide whether commons can change power asymmetries or whether they are more likely to perpetuate them. © The Author(s) 2019.",commons; Digital data; digital information; exclusion; governance,,,,,,,,,"Agrawal, A., Common resources and institutional sustainability (2002) The Drama of the Commons, pp. 41-85. , Ostrom E., Dietz T., Dolsak N., (eds), Washington, DC, National Academy Press, In:, (eds; Andrejevic, M., Big data, big questions: The big data divide (2014) International Journal of Communication, 8, pp. 1673-1689; Benkler, Y., Coase's Penguin, or Linux and the nature of the firm (2002) Yale Law Review, 112 (3), pp. 369-446; Benkler, Y., Commons-based strategies and the problems of patents (2004) Science, 305 (5687), pp. 1110-1111; Benkler, Y., Nissenbaum, H., Commons-based peer production and virtue (2006) Journal of Political Philosophy, 14 (4), pp. 394-419; Birkinbine, B.J., Commons praxis: Towards a critical political economy of the digital commons (2018) tripleC, 16 (1), pp. 290-305; Blackstone, W., (1979) Commentaries on the Laws of England 2.

The rhetoric is that ensuing predictions work well—with a high degree of autonomy and automation. We argue that we need to analyze the process of applying machine learning in depth and highlight at what point human knowledge production takes place in seemingly autonomous work. This article reintroduces classification theory as an important framework for understanding such seemingly invisible knowledge production in the machine learning development and design processes. We suggest a framework for studying such classification closely tied to different steps in the work process and exemplify the framework on two experiments with machine learning applied to Facebook data from one of our labs. By doing so we demonstrate ways in which classification and potential discrimination take place in even seemingly unsupervised and autonomous models. Moving away from concepts of non-supervision and autonomy enable us to understand the underlying classificatory dispositifs in the work process and that this form of analysis constitutes a first step towards governance of artificial intelligence. © The Author(s) 2019.,Artificial intelligence; bias; classification; discrimination; Facebook; machine learning; social media,,,,,,,,,"Alba, D., (2016) It's your fault Microsoft's teen AI turned into such a jerk, , https://www.wired.com/2016/03/fault-microsofts-teen-ai-turned-jerk/, Available at, (accessed 1 May 2018); Alpaydin, E., (2016) Machine Learning: The New AI, , Cambridge, MA, The MIT Press; Ananny, M., Crawford, K., Seeing without knowing: Limitations of the transparency ideal and its application to algorithmic accountability (2018) New Media & Society, 20 (3), pp. 973-989; Anderson, C., (2008) The End of Theory: The Data Deluge Makes The Scientific Method Obsolete, , Wired Magazine; Ashby, W.R., (1956) An Introduction to Cybernetics.

In this article, we discuss MyData, a data activism initiative originating in Finland, which aims to shape a more sustainable citizen-centric data economy by means of increasing individuals' control of their personal data. Using data gathered during long-term participant-observation in collaborative projects with data activists, we explore the internal tensions of data activism by first outlining two different social imaginaries – technological and socio-critical – within MyData, and then merging them to open practical and analytical space for engaging with the socio-technical futures currently in the making. While the technological imaginary favours data infrastructures as corrective measures, the socio-critical imaginary questions the effectiveness of technological correction. Unpacking them clarifies the kinds of political and social alternatives that different social imaginaries ascribe to the notions underlying data activism, and highlights the need to consider the social structures in play. The more far-reaching goal of our exercise is to provide practical and analytical resources for critical engagement in the context of data activism. By merging technological and socio-critical imaginaries in the work of reimagining governing structures and knowledge practices alongside infrastructural arrangements, scholars can depart from the most obvious forms of critique, influence data activism practice, and formulate data ethics and data futures. © The Author(s) 2019.",data activism; data ethics; Datafication; MyData; social imaginary; socio-technical futures,,,,,,"Tekes: 2676/31/2015

Such a task demands both an understanding of the epistemological challenge posed by the Big Data phenomenon and a critical assessment of the offers and promises coming from the area of Big Data analytics. This paper draws upon the critical social and data scientists’ view on Big Data as an epistemological challenge that stems not only from the sheer volume of digital data but, predominantly, from the proliferation of the narrow-technological and the positivist views on data. Adoption of the social-scientific epistemological stance presupposes that digital data was conceptualised as manifestations of the social. In order to answer the epistemological challenge, social scientists need to extend the repertoire of social scientific theories and conceptual frameworks that may inform the analysis of the social in the age of Big Data. However, an ‘epistemological revolution’ discourse on Big Data may hinder the integration of the social scientific knowledge into the Big Data analytics. © The Author(s) 2019.",computational science; epistemological challenge; Social and cultural Big Data analytics; social media; social science,,,,,,,,,"Adams, J., Brückner, H., Wikipedia, sociology, and the promise and pitfalls of Big Data (2015) Big Data & Society, , July–December: 1–5; Agarwal, S., Sureka, A., (2015) Applying social media intelligence for predicting and identifying on-line radicalization and civil unrest oriented threats, , https://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.06858.pdf, accessed 17 May 2017; Agre, P.E., Beyond the mirror world: Privacy and the representational practices of computing (1997) Technology and Privacy: The New Landscape, pp. 29-61. , Agre P.E., Rotenberg M., (eds), Cambridge, MA, MIT Press, (, a), In:, (eds; Agre, P.E., Toward a critical technical practice: Lessons learned in trying to reform AI (1997) Social Science, Technical Systems, and Cooperative Work: Beyond the Great Divide, pp. 131-157. , Bowker G., Gasser L., Star L., (eds), Mahwah, NJ, Erlbaum, (, b), In:, (eds; Albert, C.S., Salam, A.F., Critical discourse analysis: Toward theories in social media (2013) Proceedings of the Nineteenth Americas Conference on Information Systems, pp. 1-8. , Chicago, IL, 15–17 August 2013; Andersen, C., The end of theory: The data deluge makes the scientific method obsolete (2008) Wired, , 23 June; Aragona, B., New data science: The sociological point of view (2017) Data Science and Social Research: Epistemology, Methods, Technology and Applications, pp. 17-24. , Lauro N.C., Amaturo E., Grassia M.G., (eds), Cham, Switzerland, Springer International Publishing AG, In:, (eds; Atran, S., Axelrod, R., Davis, R., Challenges in researching terrorism from the field (2017) Science, 355 (6323), pp. 352-354; Bakhtin, M.M., (1981) The Dialogic Imagination, , Austin, University of Texas Press; Bhui, K., Warfa, N., Jones, E., Is violent radicalisation associated with poverty, migration, poor self-reported health and common mental disorders?

This article analyses data as a form of capital that is distinct from, but has its roots in, economic capital. Data collection is driven by the perpetual cycle of capital accumulation, which in turn drives capital to construct and rely upon a universe in which everything is made of data. The imperative to capture all data, from all sources, by any means possible influences many key decisions about business models, political governance, and technological development. This article argues that many common practices of data accumulation should actually be understood in terms of data extraction, wherein data is taken with little regard for consent and compensation. By understanding data as a form capital, we can better analyse the meaning, practices, and implications of datafication as a political economic regime. © The Author(s) 2019.",Big Data; Bourdieu; digital capitalism; Marx; political economy; value,,,,,,,,,"Ackerman, S., Thielman, S., (2016) US intelligence chief: We might use the Internet of Things to spy on you, , www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/feb/09/internet-of-things-smart-home-devices-government-surveillance-james-clapper, The Guardian, 9 February, accessed 13 December 2018; Aitken, R., ‘All data is credit data’: Constituting the unbanked (2017) Competition & Change, 21 (4), pp. 274-300; Andrejevic, M., The big data divide (2014) International Journal of Communication, 8, pp. 1673-1689; Angwin, J., Valentino-Devries, J., New tracking frontier: Your license plates (2012) The Wall Street Journal, , http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10000872396390443995604578004723603576296, Epub ahead of print 29 September 2012.

This term is surrounded with positive rhetoric and promises about the ability to analyse real-world data quickly and comprehensively. Such rhetoric is highly consequential in shaping debates on Big Data. While the fields of Science and Technology Studies and Critical Data Studies have been instrumental in elaborating the neglected and problematic dimensions of Big Data, it remains an open question how and to what extent such insights become embedded in other fields. In this paper, we analyse the epistemological claims that accompany Big Data in the healthcare domain. We systematically searched scientific literature and selected 206 editorials as these reflect on developments in the domain. Through an interpretive analysis, we construct five ideal-typical discourses that all frame Big Data in specific ways. Three of the discourses (the modernist, instrumentalist and pragmatist) frame Big Data in positive terms and disseminate a compelling rhetoric. Metaphors of ‘capturing’, ‘illuminating’ and ‘harnessing’ data presume that Big Data are benign and leading to valid knowledge. The scientist and critical-interpretive discourses question the objectivity and effectivity claims of Big Data. Metaphors of ‘selecting’ and ‘constructing’ data illustrate another political message, framing Big Data as limited. We conclude that work in the critical-interpretive discourse has not broadly infiltrated the medical domain. Ways to better integrate aspects of the discourse in the healthcare domain are urgently needed. © The Author(s) 2018.",Big Data; discourse analysis; editorials; evidence; healthcare; systematic review,,,,,,"Erasmus Universiteit Rotterdam, EUR","We thank the anonymous reviewers for their valuable feedback on earlier versions of the paper.

The epistemic limits of this emerging computational paradigm are outlined through a comparison with the discussions in the early days of digitalization, when digital technology was primarily seen through the lens of dematerialization, and as part of the larger processes of “postmodernity”. Since then, the online landscape has become increasingly centralized, and the “liquidity” of dematerialized technology has come to empower online platforms in shaping the conditions for human behavior. This contrast between the contemporary epistemological currents and the previous philosophical discussions brings to the fore contradictions within the study of digital social life: While qualitative change has become increasingly dominant, the focus has gone towards quantitative methods; while the platforms have become empowered to shape social behavior, the focus has gone from social context to naturalizing social patterns; while meaning is increasingly contested and fragmented, the role of hermeneutics has diminished; while platforms have become power hubs pursuing their interests through sophisticated data manipulation, the data they provide is increasingly trusted to hold the keys to understanding social life. These contradictions, we argue, are partially the result of a lack of philosophical discussion on the nature of social reality in the digital era; only from a firm metatheoretical perspective can we avoid forgetting the reality of the system under study as we are affected by the powerful social life of Big Data. © The Author(s) 2018.",Big Data; computational social science; data analytics; data-driven science; end of theory; epistemology,,,,,,,,,"Alter, A., (2017) Irresistible: The Rise of Addictive Technology and the Business of keeping us Hooked, , London, Penguin; Anderson, C., The Petabyte age: Because more isn’t just more–more is different (2008) Wired Magazine, 16 (7), pp. 106-120; Anderson, P.W., More is different (1972) Science, 177 (4047), pp. 393-396; Andersson, C., Törnberg, A., Törnberg, P., Societal systems – Complex or worse?

Indeed, a growing number of ‘qualitatively’ inclined researchers are beginning to use computational techniques in more critical, reflexive and hermeneutic ways. However, many of these claims for ‘quali-quantitative’ methods hinge on a single technique: the network graph. Networks are relational, allow for the questioning of rigid categories and zooming from individual cases to patterns at the aggregate. While not refuting the use of networks in these studies, this paper argues that there must be other ways of doing quali-quantitative methods. We first consider a phenomenon which falls between quantitative and qualitative traditions but remains elusive to network graphs: the spread of information on Twitter. Through a case study of debates about nuclear power on Twitter, we develop a novel data visualisation called the modulation sequencer which depicts the spread of URLs over time and retains many of the key features of networks identified above. Finally, we reflect on the role of such tools for the project of quali-quantitative methods. © The Author(s) 2018.",ANT; information diffusion; networks; Quali-quantitative methods; STS; Twitter,,,,,,"Economic and Social Research Council, ESRC: 1088315",,,"Abbott, A., (1999) Department and Discipline: Chicago Sociology at 100, , Chicago, University of Chicago Press; Abbott, A., Forrest, J., Optimal matching methods for historical sequences (1986) The Journal of Interdisciplinary History, 16 (3), pp. 471-494; Abildgaard, M.S., Birkbak, A., Jensen, T.E., Five recent play dates (2017) EASST Review, 362; Barry, A., Tarde’s method: Between statistics and experimentation (2010) The Social After Gabriel Tarde: Debates and Assessments, pp. 177-190. , Candea M., (ed), Abingdon, Routledge, In:, (ed; Bennett, W.L., Segerberg, A., (2013) The Logic of Connective Action: Digital Media and the Personalization of Contentious Politics, , New York, Cambridge University Press; Blackmore, S., (2000) The Meme Machine, , Oxford, Oxford University Press; Blok, A., Pedersen, M.A., Complementary social science?

In this paper, the story of Sciences Po Médialab told by Venturini et al. is discussed and completed by demonstrating the incoherence in the choice of digital methods at the Médialab from the actor network theory perspective. As the Médialab mostly used web topologies as structural analysis of social positions, they were not able to account for the propagation of ideas, considered in actor network theory as non-humans that have their own agency. The main arguments in favour of the ‘more continuous social’ developed at the Médialab (quali-quanti, following the actors, zooming) proved to be as misleading as the network metaphor. The distribution of agency that actor network theory so successfully expands was paradoxicallty reduced to structures and individual preferences, to the detriment of the agency of replications that circulate entities in the form of messages, content or memes, and that should now become the next step for actor network theory-style digital methods. © The Author(s) 2018.",actor network theory; agency; Digital methods; quantification; replications; web studies,,,,,,,,,"Akrich, M., Callon, M., Latour, B., (2006) Sociologie de la traduction.

Digital structures are strongly influenced by continuing stagnation. This technological stasis – the lack of change in technology – influences data in various ways, as demonstrated by the intensive discussion of the issue by computer scientists and software engineers. However, existing research describing stagnating software is often technic centred and fuzzy, while critical research is barely considering issues of technological stasis in the digital context at all. Therefore, this paper aims for enriching this body of knowledge in order to shed light on aging data structures. I reframe technological stasis with a social-constructivist perspective – using the approach of Social Construction of Technology – especially with the concept of technological frames. Based on the case example of OpenStreetMap, my findings suggest that the data structure – and its stasis – is the outcome of competing understandings and perspectives, shaped by power asymmetries. Although the data structure did not significantly change for more than 10 years, I demonstrate that this is not because of a lack of motivation, nor technological difficulties of carrying out such changes. The technological stasis is rather rooted in the dominant position of few project members who are able to change the software design; it is their perception of the project that defines how data should be stored and what features are dispensable. © The Author(s) 2018.",data structure; legacy software; OpenStreetMap; Social construction of technology; technological frames; technological stasis,,,,,,,,,"Achtenhagen, L., Müller-Lietzkow, J., zu Knyphausen-Aufseß, D., Das open source-dilemma: Open Source-Software zwischen freier Verfügbarkeit und Kommerzialisierung (2003) Schmalenbachs Zeitschrift für betriebswirtschaftliche Forschung, 55 (5), pp. 455-481; Bennett, K., Legacy systems: Coping with success (1995) IEEE Software, 12 (1), pp. 19-23; Bijker, W.E., (2002) Of Bicycles, Bakelites, and Bulbs: Toward a Theory of Sociotechnical Change, Cambridge, MA. , MIT Press; Bijker, W.E., The social construction of bakelite: Toward a theory of invention (2012) The Social Construction of Technological Systems: New Directions in the Sociology and History of Technology, pp. 155-182. , Douglas D.G., Hughes T.P., Pinch T.J., (eds), Cambridge, MA, MIT Press, In:, (eds; Bijker, W.E., Hughes, T.P., Pinch, T., (1987) The Social Construction of Technological Systems: New Directions in the Sociology and History of Technology, , Cambridge, MA, MIT Press; Bitzer, J., Schrettl, W., Schröder, P.J.H., Intrinsic motivation in open source software development (2007) Journal of Comparative Economics, 35 (1), pp. 160-169; Budhathoki, N.R., Haythornthwaite, C., Motivation for open collaboration (2013) American Behavioral Scientist, 57 (5), pp. 548-575; Chiang, C.-C., Bayrak, C., Legacy software modernization (2006) 2006 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics, pp. 1304-1309. , Taipei, Taiwan, 8–11 October 2006; Coast, S., (2015) The Book of OSM, , Denver, CO, Steve Coast; Cunningham, W., (1992) The WyCash Portfolio Management System, , http://c2.com/doc/oopsla92.html, (accessed 21 August 2017); Eick, S.G., Graves, T.L., Karr, A.F., Does code decay?: Assessing the evidence from change management data (2001) IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering, 27 (1), pp. 1-12; Feller, J., Fitzgerald, B., A framework analysis of the open source software development paradigm (2000) Proceedings of the Twenty First International Conference on Information Systems (Ed Association for Information Systems), pp. 58-69. , Brisbane, Australia, 10–13 December 2000; Fischer, P., Hofer, P., (2008) Lexikon der Informatik, , Berlin, Springer; Glasze, G., Schlieder, C., Plennert, M., (2018) The Socio-Technical Background of an Unconventional Software Architecture in Openstreetmap: Understanding the Implementation of ‘folksonomy', , Computational Culture; Haklay, M., Singleton, A., Parker, C., Web Mapping 2.0: The neogeography of the GeoWeb (2008) Geography Compass, 2 (6), pp. 2011-2039; Haklay, M., Weber, P., OpenStreetMap: User-generated street maps (2008) IEEE Pervasive Computing, 7 (4), pp. 12-18; Hommels, A., Studying obduracy in the city: Toward a productive fusion between technology studies and urban studies (2005) Science, Technology & Human Values, 30 (3), pp. 323-351; Hughes, T., The evolution of large technological systems (1987) The Social Construction of Technological Systems: New Directions in the Sociology and History of Technology, pp. 51-82. , Bijker W.E., Hughes T.P., Pinch T., (eds), Cambridge, MA, MIT Press, In:, (eds; Iivari, N., Empowering the users?

This article examines the implications of the employment of automation techniques and ‘data-driven analysis’ in long-term biodiversity monitoring. What are the pathways and paradoxes in the possible public acceptance of automated data-sets as a trustworthy source for use in global protection and regulation of biodiversity? This article suggests that the precautionary discourse aid topdown measures for the public acceptability of the use of such techniques. Automated biodiversity monitoring offers distinctive advantages to further precautionary goals in terms of a faster, cost-effective and less messy way of collecting data, at a large scale over long periods of time. However, it contradicts other values implied through precaution – for instance the opacity and reification of the construction of risk. How do the specific forms of data-making relate with specific forms of risk governance, and what implications does this have for helping us to understand appropriate ways of political representation in governance?

Between 2014 and 2017, we conducted four case studies on government administrative data for education, transport, energy and health. The purpose of the research was to examine stakeholder perspectives about the sharing, linking and re-use (secondary use) of government administrative data. In relation to the role and nature of consent given by data subjects for re-use, our study revealed significant variations in data provider and researcher attitudes. Although our study setting was England, we believe that the findings have wider resonance. Our analysis identified six factors which might account for the variations around consent: the specificities of the legislative framework governing the collection and processing of particular data; the type of data being collected and the relational context in which it is created; the broader information governance framework in which the data resides; the creating organization's approach to data release; the relative levels of risk aversity within the creating organization; and public perceptions and social attitudes. In conclusion, we consider whether consent is still the best mechanism available for data re-use, or whether a social contract model of data sharing should be developed. © The Author(s) 2018.",Administrative data; consent; data protection; information governance; open data; privacy,,,,,,"Economic and Social Research Council, ESRC

The data interpretation and knowledge production process is here automated, while at the same time hailing narrativity as a fundamental human ability of meaning-making. Reading both the marketing rhetoric and the functionality of the automated narrative services through narrative theory allows for a contextualization of the rhetoric flourishing in Big Data discourse. Building upon case material obtained from companies such as Arria NLG, Automated Insights, Narrativa, Narrative Science, and Yseop, this article argues that what might be seen as a ‘re-turn’ of narrative as a form of knowledge production that can make sense of large data sets inscribes itself in – but also rearticulates – an ongoing debate about what narrative entails. Methodological considerations are thus raised on the one hand about the insights to be gained for critical data studies by turning to literary theory, and on the other hand about how automated technologies may inform our understanding of narrative as a faculty of human meaning-making. © The Author(s) 2018.",automation; datafication; knowledge production; literary theory; Narrative; Natural Language Generation,,,,,,,I am grateful for the helpful suggestions and comments received from the anonymous reviewers as well as the editors of this issue.,,"(2017) Arria NLG, , https://www.arria.com, (accessed 18 October 2017); (2017) Automated Insights, , www.automatedinsights.com, accessed 18 October 2017; Barthes, R., The death of the author (1977) Image–Music–Text, pp. 142-148. , Barthes R., (ed), New York, NY, Hill and Wang, In:, (ed; Benjamin, W., The storyteller (2006) The Novel: An Anthology of Criticism and Theory 1900–2000, pp. 361-378. , Hale D.J., (ed), Malden, MA, Blackwell Publishing, In:, (ed; Bringsjord, S., Ferrucci, D., (1999) Artificial Intelligence and Literary Creativity: Inside the Mind of BRUTUS, a storytelling machine, , Mahwah, NJ, Erlbaum Associates; Brooks, P., (1984) Reading for the Plot: Design and Intention in Narrative, , Cambridge, MA, Harvard University Press; Bruner, J., Life as narrative (1987) Social Research, 54, pp. 11-32; (2015) The Automated Analyst: Transforming Data into Stories with Advanced Natural Language Generation, , http://www.evolvedmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/CITO-Research_Narrative-Science:The-Automated-Analyst_White-Paper_2015.pdf, Report sponsored by Narrative Science., accessed 18 October 2017; Culler, J., Story and discourse in the analysis of narrative (1981) The Pursuit of Signs, pp. 188-208. , Culler J., (ed), London, Routledge, In:, (ed; Czarniawska, B., (1998) A Narrative Approach to Organization Studies, , Thousand Oaks, CA, Sage; Genette, G., (1980) Narrative Discourse: An Essay in Method, , Ithaca, Cornell UP; Graziosi, B., (2002) Inventing Homer: The Early Reception of Epic, , Cambridge, Cambridge University Press; Greimas, A.J., (1970) Du sens.

In the US, microtargeting relies on a broad set of collected data about the individual. However, due to the unavailability of comparable data in Germany, the practice of microtargeting is far more challenging. Citizens in Germany widely treat social media platforms as a means for political debate. The digital traces they leave through their interactions provide a rich information pool, which can create the necessary conditions for political microtargeting following appropriate algorithmic processing. More specifically, data mining techniques enable information gathering about a people's general opinion, party preferences and other non-political characteristics. Through the application of data-intensive algorithms, it is possible to cluster users in respect of common attributes, and through profiling identify whom and how to influence. Applying machine learning algorithms, this paper explores the possibility to identify micro groups of users, which can potentially be targeted with special campaign messages, and how this approach can be expanded to large parts of the electorate. Lastly, based on these technical capabilities, we discuss the ethical and political implications for the German political system. © The Author(s) 2018.",datafication; electorate; Germany; influence; Microtargeting; social media,,,,,,,,,"Agan, T., (2007) Silent Marketing: Micro-Targeting, , http://gaia.adage.com/images/random/microtarget031207.pdf, (accessed 27 March 2018); Barberá, P., Rivero, G., Understanding the political representativeness of twitter users (2015) Social Science Computer Review, 33 (6), pp. 712-729; Barberá, P., Zeitzoff, T., The new public address system: Why do world leaders adopt social media?

There is also growing concern about the risks that come with these new systems. This article makes the case for greater government transparency and accountability about uses of big data through a Government of Canada qualitative research case study. Adapting a method from critical cartographers, I employ counter-mapping to map government big data practices and internal discussions of risk and challenge. I do so by drawing on interviews and freedom of information requests. The analysis reveals that there are more concerns and risks than often publicly discussed and that there are significant areas of silence that need greater attention. The article underlines the need for our democratic systems to respond to our new datafied contexts by ensuring that our institutions make changes to better protect citizen rights, uphold democratic principles and ensure means for citizen intervention. © The Author(s) 2018.",accountability; Big data; democracy; government; transparency,,,,,,"Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada, SSHRC: 756 2011 0292",,,"Amoore, L., Piotukh, V., Life beyond big data governing with little analytics (2015) Economy and Society, 44, pp. 341-366; Ananny, M., Crawford, K., Seeing without knowing: Limitations of the transparency ideal and its application to algorithmic accountability (2018) New Media & Society, 20 (3), pp. 973-989; Angwin, J., Larson, J., Mattu, S., Machine bias (2016) Propublica, , https://www.propublica.org/article/machine-bias-risk-assessments-in-criminal-sentencing, 23 May, (accessed 2 September 2016); Aurini, J.D., Heath, M., Howells, S., (2016) The How to of Qualitative Research, , London, Sage; Bagnall, J., (2016) Build to fail: Politics of sabotaged shared services before the Department got off the ground, , http://ottawacitizen.com/news/national/built-to-crash-the-ugly-sputtering-beginning-of-shared-services-and-how-politics-conspired-against-it, Ottawa Citizen, 11 November, (accessed 3 September 2017); Barocas, S., Selbst, A.D., Big data’s disparate impact (2016) California Law Review, 104, pp. 671-732; Bartlett, J., Tkacz, N., Governance by dashboard (2017) Demos, April, , https://www.demos.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Demos-Governance-by-Dashboard.pdf, (accessed 1 October 2017); Berry, D., The computational turn: Thinking about the digital humanities (2011) Culture Machine, 12, pp. 1-22; Bertot, J.C., Gorham, U., Jaeger, P.T., Big data: Open government and e-government: Issues, policies and recommendations (2014) Information Polity, 19, pp. 5-16; Bhushan, A., Fast data, slow policy: Making the most of disruptive innovation (2014) SAIS Review of International Affairs, 34 (1), pp. 93-107; Bowen, G.A., Document analysis as a qualitative research method (2009) Qualitative Research Journal, 9 (2), pp. 27-40; boyd, D., Crawford, K., Critical questions for big data (2012) Information, Communication & Society, 15 (5), pp. 662-679; Brauneis, R., Goodman, E., Algorithmic transparency for the smart city (2017) Yale Journal of Law & Technology, , https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3012499, GWU Law School Public Law Research Paper, accessed 18 October 2017; Bright, J., Margetts, H., Hale, S., The use of social media for research and analysis: A feasibility study (2014) Department for Work & Pensions, , https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/387591/use-of-social-media-for-research-and-analysis.pdf, accessed 7 November 2016; Campolo, A., Sanfilippo, M., Whittaker, M., AI Now 2017 report (2017) AI Now, , https://assets.contentful.com/8wprhhvnpfc0/1A9c3ZTCZa2KEYM64Wsc2a/8636557c5fb14f2b74b2be64c3ce0c78/_AI_Now_Institute_2017_Report_.pdf; Carney, T., (2018) Robo-Debt Illegality: A Failure of Rule of Law Protections, , https://auspublaw.org/2018/04/robo-debt-illegality/, Australian Public Law, 30 April, accessed 4 September 2018; Chapple, S., Forward liability and welfare reform in New Zealand (2013) Policy Quarterly, 9 (2), pp. 56-62; Citron, D.K., Pasquale, F., The scored society: Due process for automated predictions (2014) Washington Law Review, 89, pp. 1-33; Clarke, A., Lindquist, E.A., Roy, J., Understanding governance in the digital era: An agenda for public administration research in Canada (2017) Canadian Public Administration, 60 (4), pp. 457-475; Clarke, R., Big data, big risks (2016) Information Systems Journal, 26 (1), pp. 77-90; Couldry, N., (2018) Colonized by Data: The Capitalization of Life without Limits, , Cardiff, Cardiff University; Couldry, N., Powell, A., Big data from the bottom up (2014) Big Data & Society, 1 (2), pp. 1-5; Dalton, C., Thatcher, J., What does a critical data studies look like, and why Do we care?

Employing critical, reflexive, and ethnographic techniques, these authors show that while algorithms can take on a multiplicity of different cultural meanings, they ultimately remain closely connected to the people who define and deploy them, and the institutions and power relations in which they are embedded. Building on a conversation we began at the Algorithms in Culture conference at U.C. Berkeley in December 2016, we collectively study algorithms as culture (Seaver, this special theme), fetish (Thomas et al.), imaginary (Christin), bureaucratic logic (Caplan and boyd), method of governance (Coletta and Kitchin; Lee; Geiger), mode of inquiry (Baumer), and mode of power (Kubler). : This article is a part of special theme on Algorithms in Culture.

Alongside this, increasing attention is focussing on the conditions necessary for maintaining a social license for research practices. Previous research has pointed to the importance of demonstrating “public benefits” from research for maintaining public support, yet there has been very little consideration of what the term “public benefits” means or what public expectations of “public benefits” are. In order to address this pressing issue a series of deliberative workshops with members of the public were held across Scotland in May and June 2017. The workshops aimed to engage a cross-section of the Scottish population in in-depth discussions of the ways that the public – or publics – might benefit from data-intensive health research. The findings reported here discuss workshop participants’ understandings and expectations of health research; who they considered to be “the public” that should benefit from health research and; in what ways they felt “the public” should benefit. Workshop participants’ preference was clearly for the widest possible public benefit to be felt by all, but they also acknowledged the value in research aiming to primarily benefit vulnerable groups within society. A key focus of discussions was the extent to which workshop participants were confident that potential public benefits would be realised. A crucial consideration then is the extent to which mechanisms and political support are in place to realise and maximise the public benefits of data-intensive health research. © The Author(s) 2018.",data science; health informatics; Public benefits; public engagement,,,,,,"Medical Research Council, MRC: MR/M501633/2

This ‘Googlization of health research’ (‘GHR’) begs the question of how the common good will be served in this research. As critical data scholars contend, such phenomena must be situated within the political economy of digital capitalism in order to foreground the question of public interest and the common good. Here, trends like GHR are framed within a double, incommensurable logic, where private gain and economic value are pitted against public good and societal value. While helpful for highlighting the exploitative potential of digital capitalism, this framing is limiting, insofar as it acknowledges only one conception of the common good. This article uses the analytical framework of modes of justification developed by Boltanksi and Thévenot to identify a plurality of orders of worth and conceptualizations of the common good at work in GHR. Not just the ‘civic’ (doing good for society) and ‘market’ (enhancing wealth creation) orders, but also an ‘industrial’ (increasing efficiency), a ‘project’ (innovation and experimentation), and what I call a ‘vitalist’ (proliferating life) order. Using promotional material of GHR initiatives and preliminary interviews with participants in GHR projects, I ask what moral orientations guide different actors in GHR. Engaging seriously with these different conceptions of the common good is paramount. First, in order to critically evaluate them and explicate what is at stake in the move towards GHR, and ultimately, in order to develop viable governance solutions that ensure strong ‘civic’ components. © The Author(s) 2018.",common good; digital capitalism; Digital health; Googlization of health research; moral repertoires; public values,,,,,,"Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek, NWO: 275-20-050",,,"https://www.23andme.com/en-eu/research/, (accessed 26 March 2018)23andMe (2018, n.d.)

We examine these challenges in the context of a feminist qualitative Big Data analysis of the hashtag event #WhyIStayed.

The administration is interpreted as a ‘most likely’ to succeed in translating the idealised version of the smart city into a workable bureaucratic practice. Drawing on the work of Orlikowski and Gash, the empirical analysis identifies and describes two incongruent ‘technological frames’ that illustrates different ways of making sense of data and the smart city within this single organisational unit. One is called the experimentalist’s credo and it is characterised by inspiration from the development of an Internet of Things as well as a readiness to learn from the open source community in software development. The other is called the data-owners vocation and it is characterised by a more situated approach that interprets data as strategic and political. It is argued that the existence of these frames provides two insights relevant for the literature on smart cities. First, they illustrate that one should be careful not to reify the smart city as a phenomenon that can be criticised in generic terms. Second, they suggest that even if there exists a transition toward the implementation of a technocratic smart city paradigm across public administrations, this paradigm is not unique in its focus on markets and evidence in governance. © The Author(s) 2018.",Big Data; sense-making; Smart city; technological frames,,,,,,,,,"Anderson, C., The end of theory: The data deluge makes the scientific method obsolete (2008) Wired Magazine, 16 (7), p. 23; Atzori, L., Iera, A., Morabito, G., The Internet of things: A survey (2010) Computer Networks, 54 (15), pp. 2787-2805; Bentham, J., (2001) A Fragment on Government, , Oxford, The Lawbook Exchange, Ltd, 1776, (, [,]; Boyd, D., Crawford, K., Critical questions for big data: Provocations for a cultural, technological and scholarly phenomenon (2012) Information, Communication & Society, 15 (5), pp. 662-679; Brandt, E., Messeter, J., Facilitating collaboration through design games (2004) Proceedings of the Eighth Conference on Participatory Design: Artful Integration: Interweaving Media, Materials and Practices, 1, pp. 121-131. , 27–31 July.

While the field of science and technology studies has had considerable success in pursuing the former goal, as Halford and Savage argue, there is an ongoing need to discover or invent ways to “do Big Data analytics differently.” In this commentary, I suggest that attempts to produce new ways of working with Big Data and analytics might be hindered by how science and technology studies-influenced scholars have conceptualized assemblages. While these scholars have foregrounded objects’ relations within existing assemblages, new materialist philosophers draw attention to properties of objects that transcend those relations and might indicate opportunities for more creative or generative uses of Big Data and analytics. © The Author(s) 2018.",actor-network theory; Big Data; methodology; new materialism,,,,,,,,,"Bates, J., Lin, Y.-W., Goodale, P., Data journeys: Capturing the socio-material constitution of data objects and flows (2016) Big Data & Society, 3 (2); Bear, C., Assembling the sea: Materiality, movement and regulatory practices in the Cardigan Bay scallop fishery (2013) Cultural Geographies, 20 (1), pp. 21-41; Bennett, J., (2009) Vibrant Matter: A Political Ecology of Things, , Durham, Duke University Press; Bogost, I., (2012) Alien Phenomenology, or, What It’s Like to be a Thing, , Minneapolis, University of Minnesota Press; Burrows, R., Savage, M., After the crisis?

In this article, we provide a concept of “datastructuring” which seeks to capture this reshaping as both a product of and productive of social activity. To do this we focus on (1) how new forms of social action map onto and are enabled by technological changes related to datafication, and (2) how new forms of datafied social action constitute a form of knowledge production which becomes embedded in technologies themselves. We illustrate the potential of the datastructuring concept with empirical examples which also serve to highlight some new avenues for research and some empirical questions to explore further. We suggest a focus on datastructuring can ignite scholarly debates across disciplines that may share an interest in the technological configurations, sorting activities, and other socio-material forces that shape digital spaces, but which are rarely brought together. Such cross-disciplinary conceptualizations may give more attention to how information is structured and organized, becomes “algorithmically recognizable”, and emerges as (in)visible in digital, datafied spaces. Such a concept, we suggest, may help us better understand the novel ways in which “backstage datawork” and “data sorting processes” gain traction in political interventions, commercial processes, and social ordering. © The Author(s) 2018.",content moderation; Datafication; infrastructures; knowledge production; platforms; social ordering,,,,,,,,,"Abbasi, A., Sarker, S., Chiang, R.H.L., Big Data research in information systems: Toward an inclusive research agenda (2016) Journal of the Association for Information Systems, 17 (2); Alaimo, C., Kallinikos, J., Computing the everyday: Social media as data platforms (2017) Information Society, 33 (4), pp. 175-191; Amoore, L., Piotukh, V., Life beyond big data: Governing with little analytics (2015) Economy & Society, 44 (3), pp. 341-366; Ananny, M., Crawford, K., Seeing without knowing: Limitations of the transparency ideal and its application to algorithmic accountability (2018) New Media & Society, 20 (3), pp. 973-989; Baesens, B., Bapna, R., Marsden, J., Transformational issues of big data and analytics in networked business (2016) MIS Quarterly, 40 (4), pp. 807-818; Bateson, G., (1972) Steps to an Ecology of Mind, , Chicago, University of Chicago Press; (2016) Trump’s Twitter Debate Lead was ‘swelled by bots’, , http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-37684418; (2016) Inside the Trump Bunker, with Days to Go, , https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-10-27/inside-the-trump-bunker-with-12-days-to-go, (accessed 29 August 2018); Boellstorff, T., Making big data, in theory (2013) First Monday, 18 (10). , http://firstmonday.org/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/4869/3750%2330a, Available at, (accessed 7 November 2017); Bond, R.M., Fariss, C.J., Jones, J.J., A 61-million-person experiment in social influence and political mobilization (2012) Nature, 489, pp. 295-298; Bowker, G., Data flakes: An afterword to “Raw Data” is an oxymoron (2013) Raw Data” is an Oxymoron, pp. 167-172. , Gitelman L., (ed), Cambridge, MA, The MIT Press, In:, (ed; Bowker, G.B., Baker, K., Millerand, F., Toward information infrastructure studies: Ways of knowing in a networked environment (2010) International Handbook of Internet Research, pp. 97-117. , Hunsiger J., (ed), London, Springer, In:, (eds; Bowker, G.B., Star, S.L., (1999) Sorting Things Out: Classification and Its Consequences, , Cambridge, MA, The MIT Press; boyd, D., Crawford, K., Critical questions for big data (2012) Information, Communication & Society, 15 (5), pp. 662-679; Brewer, P.R., (2008) Value War: Public Opinion and the Politics of Gay Rights, , Plymouth, Rowman & Littlefield; Bucher, T., Helmond, A., The affordances of social media platforms (2017) The SAGE Handbook of Social Media, , Burgess J., Poell T., Marwick A., (eds), London/New York, NY, SAGE Publications, In:, (eds; Costas, J., Grey, C., (2016) Secrecy at Work: The Hidden Architecture of Organizational Life, , Stanford, Stanford University Press; Czarniawska, B., (1997) A Narrative Approach to Organization Studies, , London, Sage; DeNardis, L., Hackl, A.M., Internet governance by social media platforms (2015) Telecommunications Policy, 39 (9), pp. 761-770; Desrosières, A., (2002) The Politics of Large Numbers: A History of Statistical Reasoning, , Cambridge, MA, Harvard University Press; Dutton, W., Reisdorf, B., Dubois, E., (2017) Internet Search and Politics: The Uses and Impacts of Search in Britain, , France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Spain, and the United States.

Our observation and insight into these data activities and strategies are achieved through ethnographic and engaged research and participatory design. We find that counter-data action through community-collected data is rooted in a legacy of Atlanta’s black activism and black scholarship; that this data activism enabled resource mobilization and critical conscious making; and that design and media production are essential post counter-data action activities in data activism. Based on these findings, we urge the field of open government data to broaden their concept of social impact of data to include the use data to mobilize resources within oppressed communities not to influence policy and government but to build capacities within community in order to transform, not join, political structures. We also advocate that scholars within the fields of open government data, critical data studies, and data activism recognize the legacy and historic practice of data activism by black communities working towards social change. © The Author(s) 2018.",Community; counter data; data; data activism; design; empowerment,,,,,,,"We are grateful to the members of the Westside Atlanta Land Trust (WALT) for allowing us to accompany them in their persistent advocacy efforts.

From childhood until death, we are faced with an unending series of choices through which we cultivate a sense of self, govern conduct, and shape the future. Nowadays, individuals increasingly experience and enact consumer choice online through web-based platforms such as Yelp.com, TripAdvisor.com and Amazon.com. These platforms not only provide a sprawling array of goods and services to choose from, but also reviews, ratings and ranking devices and systems of classification to navigate this landscape of choice. This paper suggests a radical reconsideration of platform architectures and design features to consider how they reconfigure and respecify choice, ‘choosers’, and choice-making practices. Platforms are not simply cameras that present choice and enable comparisons between different options, but are more akin to engines that govern, drive and expand choice, configuring users within particular discourses, practices and subjectivities. In making sense of the entangled trajectories of consumer choice, platform architectures and Big Data, I suggest that ‘hyper-choice’ emerges as a condition of the contemporary platform-driven web. I examine hyper-choice not only in terms of the relationship between platforms and a growing abundance of choice, but more importantly how platforms reconfigure choice in ways that go beyond and fundamentally challenge existing understandings of what choice is, who and what is involved in producing knowledge about choice, and what it means to be a ‘chooser’. © The Author(s) 2018.",Choice; classification; platforms; produsage; ratings; Web 2.0,,,,,,,,,"Anderson, C., (2010) Free: How Today's Smartest Businesses Profit by giving Something for Nothing, , New York, NY, Hyperion; Ben-Porath, S., (2010) Tough Choices: Structured Paternalism and the Landscape of Choice, , Princeton, NJ, Princeton University Press; Blank, G., (2007) Critics, Ratings, and Society: The Sociology of Reviews, , Lanham, MD, Rowman and Littlefield; Bowker, G.C., Baker, K., Millerand, F., Toward information infrastructure studies: Ways of knowing in a networked environment (2010) International Handbook of Internet Research, pp. 97-117. , Hunsinger J., Klastrup L., Allen M., (eds), New York, NY, Springer, In:, (eds; Bowker, G.C., Star, S.L., How things (actor-net)work: Classification, magic and the ubiquity of standards (1996) Philosophia, 25 (3-4), pp. 195-220; boyd, D., Social network sites as networked publics – Affordances, dynamics, and implications (2011) A networked self, pp. 39-58. , Papacharissi Z., (ed), New York, NY, Routledge, In:, (ed; Bruns, A., (2008) Blogs, Wikipedia, Second Life, and Beyond: From Production to Produsage, , New York, NY, Peter Lang; Bruns, A., Schmidt, J., Produsage: A closer look at continuing developments (2011) New Review of Hypermedia and Multimedia, 17 (1), pp. 3-7; Bucher, T., Want to be on the top?

I ask at the outset why conceptualizations of digital governance are so bleak, and I argue that all are underscored implicitly by a Deleuzian theory of desire that overlooks agency, defined here in Foucauldian terms. I subsequently conceptualize digital governance as encompassing subjection as well as resistance, and I cast the two in relational perspective by making use of the concepts “affordance” and “assemblage” in conjunction with multiple subjectivities and Foucault's view of power as productive as well as his view of resistance as an “antagonism of strategies” in his late scholarship on resistance, ethics, and subjectivity. I offer examples of salient modes of what I call “productive” resistance (as opposed to resistance by way of avoidance, disruption or obfuscation), and from a Foucauldian perspective I explain how each mode targets and subverts technologies of repressive power to produce new elements of the digital environment and construct new truths. I conclude by recognizing the agency embodied in resistance as an end in itself, but I also consider that modes of productive resistance can have extrinsic value as they affect the fluid interaction among elements of the digital environment, potentially disrupting the presumed structure of dominance and dependence, and opening our conceptualization of algorithmic life to hopeful possibilities for change. © The Author(s) 2018.",Affordance; algorithms; assemblage; Foucault; resistance; subjectivity,,,,,,"Institute for the Social Sciences, Cornell University, ISS

Personalization, with all the risks of discrimination and bias it entails, has been the critical focus in accounts of consumption, government, social media, and health. This paper argues that personalization through models using large-scale data is part of a more expansive change in probabilization that, in principle, is not reducible to individual or ‘personal’ attributes and actions. It describes the ‘personalization’ of an online grocery shopping recommender system to list a small number of grocery items of personal relevance for each of the millions of online grocery shoppers at a major UK supermarket chain. Drawing on a theory of probability proposed by the philosopher of science Karl Popper and anthropological work on shopping, it suggests that the attempt to generate personalized predictions necessarily incorporates impersonal relations to others and things. Using a mixture of discourse analysis and code-based reconstruction of key elements of the recommender system, it suggests that personalization is one facet of an open-ended weave of propensities associated with people and things in contemporary big data configurations. The paper explores how, in the context of recommender systems, the constitutive incompleteness of shopping lists, their propensity to expand or change, might be more important than their capacity to be personalized. © The Author(s) 2018.",Machine learning; personalization; platform; probability; recommender system; shopping,,,,,,,,,"(2017) Recsys 2017 – Accepted Contributions – Recsys, , https://recsys.acm.org/recsys17/accepted-contributions/, RecSys 2017, (accessed 6 February 2018); Agrawal, R., Fast algorithms for mining association rules (1994) Proc. 20Th Int.

However, analyses of social media data are typically undertaken by focusing on ‘snapshots’ of issues using query-keyword search strategies. This paper develops an alternative, less issue-based, mode of analysing Twitter data. It provides a framework for working qualitatively with longitudinally-oriented Twitter data (user-timelines), and uses an empirical case to consider the value and the challenges of doing so. Exploring how Twitter users place “everyday” talk around the socio-political issue of UK welfare provision, we draw on digital ethnography and narrative analysis techniques to analyse 25 user-timelines and identify three distinctions in users’ practices: users’ engagements with welfare as TV entertainment or as a socio-political concern; the degree of sustained engagement with said issues, and; the degree to which users’ tweeting practices around welfare were congruent with or in contrast to their other tweets. With this analytic orientation, we demonstrate how a longitudinal analysis of user-timelines provides rich resources that facilitate a more nuanced understanding of user engagement in everyday socio-political discussions online. © The Author(s) 2018.",digital ethnography; digital methods; narrative analysis; Social media analytics; social welfare; socio-political issues,,,,,,"Research Councils UK, RCUK: ES/M003574/1",,,"Allen, K., Tyler, I., De Benedictis, S., Thinking with ‘White Dee’: The gender politics of ‘austerity porn’ (2014) Sociological Research Online, 19 (3), p. 2; Bastos, M.T., Raimundo, R.L.G., Travitzki, R., Gatekeeping twitter: Message diffusion in political hashtags (2013) Media, Culture and Society, 35 (2), pp. 260-270; Bingham-Hall, J., Law, S., Connected or informed?: Local Twitter networking in a London neighbourhood (2015) Big Data and Society, 2 (2), pp. 1-17; (2013) Ethics guidelines for internet-mediated research, , http://www.bps.org.uk/system/files/Public%20files/inf206-guidelines-for-internet-mediated-research.pdf, (accessed 1 March 2017); Brooker, P., Vines, J., Sutton, S., Debating poverty porn on Twitter: Social media as a place for everyday socio-political talk (2015) CHI '15 Proceedings of the 33Rd Annual ACM Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems, pp. 3177-3186. , Seoul, South Korea, 18–23 April 2015, New York, NY: ACM; Brooker, P., Barnett, J., Cribbin, T., Doing social media analytics (2016) Big Data & Society, 3 (2), pp. 1-12; Bruner, J., The narrative construction of reality (1991) Critical Inquiry, 18 (1), pp. 1-21; Bruns, A., Highfield, T., Burgess, J., The Arab Spring and social media audiences: English and Arabic Twitter users and their networks (2013) American Behavioral Scientist, 57 (7), pp. 871-898; Cassidy, E., Social networking sites and participatory reluctance: A case study of gaydar, user resistance and interface rejection (2016) New Media and Society, 18 (11), pp. 2613-2628; Chou, W.-Y.S., Hunt, Y., Folkers, A., Cancer survivorship in the age of YouTube and social media: A narrative analysis (2011) Journal of Medical Internet Research, 13 (1), p. e7; Chretien, K.C., Tuck, M.G., Simon, M., A digital ethnography of medical students who use Twitter for professional development (2015) Journal of General Internal Medicine, 30 (11), pp. 1673-1680; Doughty, M., Rowland, D., Lawson, S., Co-viewing live TV with digital backchannel streams (2011) Euroitv '11 Proceedings of the 9Th International Conference on Interactive Television, pp. 141-144. , Lisbon, Portugal, 29 June–1 July 2011, New York, NY: ACM; Elster, J., (1998) Deliberative Democracy, , Cambridge, Cambridge University Press; Foucault Welles, B., On minorities and outliers: The case for making Big Data small (2014) Big Data and Society, 1 (1), pp. 1-2; Freelon, D., Kriplean, T., Morgan, J., Facilitating encounters with political difference: Engaging voters with the living voters guide (2011) JITP ’11 Proceedings of the Third Annual Thematic Journal of Information Technology and Politics Conference, , Seattle, WA, 16–17 May 2011, paper 5; Fuchs, C., (2013) Social Media: A Critical Introduction, , London, Sage; Gehl, R.W., Power/freedom on the dark web: A digital ethnography of the dark web social network (2016) New Media and Society, 18 (7), pp. 1219-1235; Georgakopoulou, A., Small stories transposition and social media: A micro-perspective on the ‘Greek crisis’ (2014) Discourse and Society, 25 (4), pp. 519-539; Georgakopoulou, A., Small stories research: A narrative paradigm for the analysis of social media (2017) The SAGE Handbook of Social Media Research Methods, pp. 266-281. , Sloan L., Quan-Haase A., (eds), London, Sage Publications Ltd, In:, (eds; Gonzalez-Polledo, E., Chronic media worlds: Social media and the problem of pain communication on Tumblr (2016) Social Media + Society, 2 (1), pp. 1-11; Graham, T., Everyday political talk in the internet-based public sphere (2015) Handbook of Digital Politics, pp. 247-263. , Coleman S., Freelon D., (eds), Cheltenham, Edward Elgar Publishing Limited, In:, (eds; Graham, T., Wright, S., Analysing ‘super-participation’ in online third spaces (2014) Analyzing Social Media Data and Web Networks, pp. 197-215. , Cantijoch M., Gibson R., Ward S., (eds), Basingstoke, Palgrave Macmillan UK, In:, (eds; Habermas, J., (1991) The Structural Transformation of the Public Sphere, , Cambridge, MA, The MIT Press; Hallett, R.E., Barber, K., Ethnographic research in a cyber era (2014) Journal of Contemporary Ethnography, 43 (3), pp. 306-330; Halpern, D., Gibbs, J., Social media as a catalyst for online deliberation?

These works have, however, remained as programmatic suggestions, leaving us with limited methodological inputs on how to archive such complementary integration. This article responds to this limitation by proposing a method for ‘blending’ big and thick analytical insights. The paper first develops a methodological framework based on the cognitivist linguistics terminology of ‘blending’. Two cases are then explored in which blended spaces are crafted from engaging big and thick analytical insights with each other. Through these examples, we learn how blending processes should be conducted as a rapid, iterative and collaborative effort with respect for individual expertise. Further, we demonstrate how the unique, but often overlooked, granularity of big data plays a key role in affording the blending with thick data. We conclude by suggesting four commonly appearing blending strategies that can be applied when relying upon big and thick data sources. © The Author(s) 2018.",Big data; blending; ethnography; ethnomethodology; granularity; multimethodology; thick data,,,,,,,"The author would like to thank the entire team behind the study, notably Johan Tr?rup, S?ren Gravholt-Nielsen, H?vard Lundberg and Heidi S?rensen.

Although social media platforms were created for purposes other than academic research – which are apparent in their architecture and temporalities – they offer opportunities for researchers to repurpose them for the collection, generation and analysis of rich datasets. At the same time, this repurposing raises an evolving range of practical and methodological challenges at the small and large scale. We draw on our experiences and empirical data from two research projects, one using Facebook Community Pages and the other repurposing Facebook Activity Logs. This article reflects critically on the specific challenges we faced using these platform features, on their common roots, and the tactics we adopted in response. De Certeau’s distinction between strategy and tactics provides a useful framework for exploring these struggles as located in the practice of doing social research – which often ends up being tactical. This article argues that we have to collectively discuss, demystify and devise tactics to mitigate the strategies and temporalities deeply embedded in platforms, corresponding as far as possible to the temporalities and the aims of our research.

In doing so, we advance critical discussions of digital data by accounting for how data might be in processes of decay, making, repair, re-making and growth, which are inextricable from the ongoing forms of creativity that stem from everyday contingencies and improvisatory human activity. We build and demonstrate our argument through three examples drawn from mundane everyday activity: the incompleteness, inaccuracy and dispersed nature of personal self-tracking data; the data cleaning and repair processes of Big Data analysis and how data can turn into noise and vice versa when they are transduced into sound within practices of music production and sound art. This, we argue is a necessary step for considering the meaning and implications of data as it is increasingly mobilised in ways that impact society and our everyday worlds. © The Author(s) 2018.",broken world theory; Digital data; ethnography; improvisation; repair,,,,,,,,,"Appadurai, A., (1988) The Social Life of Things: Commodities in Cultural Perspective, , Cambridge, Cambridge University Press; Bell, G., The secret life of Big Data (2015) Data, Now Bigger and Better!, pp. 7-26. , Boellstorf T., Maurer B., (eds), Chicago, Prickly Paradigm Press, In:, (eds; Berson, J., (2015) Computable Bodies: Instrumented Life and the Human Somatic Niche, , London, Bloomsbury; Boellstorff, T., Making Big Data, in theory (2013) First Monday, 18 (10). , http://firstmonday.org/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/4869/3750#56a, (accessed 6th April 2017); boyd, D., Crawford, K., Critical questions for Big Data: Provocations for a cultural, technological, and scholarly phenomenon (2012) Information, Communication & Society, 15 (5), pp. 662-679; Cascone, K., The Aesthetics of Failure: “Post-Digital” Tendencies in Contemporary Computer Music (2000) Computer Music Journal, 24 (4), pp. 12-18; Dant, T., The work of repair: Gesture, emotion and sensual knowledge (2010) Sociological Research Online, 15 (3), p. 7; Delfanti, A., Iaconesi, S., Open source cancer.

This has prompted growing concerns over the ability of mobile media users to develop informed stances towards how and why their data is being used, i.e. to build ‘conscious’ and/or ‘resistant’ forms of ‘data agency’. This paper explores ways of developing the critical consciousness and resistant practices of young mobile media users towards personal data. Drawing on research with 27 young people (aged 13–17 years), the paper describes efforts to make representations of third party use of personal data openly available as a basis from which to develop data-savvy tactics and strategies. The results of these interventions – while only partially successful – offer valuable insights into the technical, social and cultural issues that shape young people’s engagement with personal data. The paper concludes by considering how concerns over data agency might be better aligned with the realities of young people’s mobile media use. © The Author(s) 2018.",data literacies; data obfuscation; mobile media; Personal data; teenagers,,,,,,"auDA Foundation, auDA: 2016",,,"Ananny, M., Crawford, K., Seeing without knowing: Limitations of the transparency ideal and its application to algorithmic accountability (2017) New Media and Society, , Epub ahead of print. 1461444816676645; Andrejevic, M., The big data divide (2014) International Journal of Communication, 8, pp. 1673-1689; Digital Me (2017) Melbourne: Australian Psychological Society, , http://compassforlife.org.au/digital-me-survey/, Available at:, accessed 7 March 2018; Bechmann, A., Internet profiling (2013) Medie Kultur, 55, pp. 72-91; Beer, D., Power through the algorithm?

The onto-epistemological dimensions of human–data assemblages and their relationship to bodies and selves have yet to be thoroughly theorised. In this essay, I draw on key perspectives espoused in feminist materialism, vital materialism and the anthropology of material culture to examine the ways in which these assemblages operate as part of knowing, perceiving and sensing human bodies. I draw particularly on scholarship that employs organic metaphors and concepts of vitality, growth, making, articulation, composition and decomposition. I show how these metaphors and concepts relate to and build on each other, and how they can be applied to think through humans’ encounters with their digital data. I argue that these theoretical perspectives work to highlight the material and embodied dimensions of human–data assemblages as they grow and are enacted, articulated and incorporated into everyday lives. © The Author(s) 2018.",Digital data; epistemology; ontology; personal data; social theory; sociomaterial,,,,,,,,,"Amoore, L., Hall, A., Taking people apart: Digitised dissection and the body at the border (2009) Environment and Planning D: Society and Space, 27, pp. 444-464; Andrejevic, M., Hearn, A., Kennedy, H., Cultural studies of data mining: Introduction (2015) European Journal of Cultural Studies, 18, pp. 379-394; Barad, K., Posthumanist performativity: Toward an understanding of how matter comes to matter (2003) Signs, 28, pp. 801-831; Barad, K., (2007) Meeting the Universe Halfway: Quantum Physics and the Entanglement of Matter and Meaning, , Durham, Duke University Press; Barad, K., Diffracting diffraction: Cutting together-apart (2014) Parallax, 20, pp. 168-187; Beer, D., (2013) Popular Culture and New Media: The Politics of Circulation, , Houndmills, Palgrave Macmillan; Beer, D., Burrows, R., Popular culture, digital archives and the new social life of data (2013) Theory, Culture & Society, 30, pp. 47-71; Bennett, J., The force of things: Steps toward an ecology of matter (2004) Political Theory, 32, pp. 347-372; Bennett, J., A vitalist stopover on the way to a new materialism (2010) New Materialisms: Ontology, Agency and Politics, pp. 47-69. , Coole D., Frost S., (eds), Durham, NC, Duke University Press, In:, (eds; Berson, J., (2015) Computable Bodies: Instrumented Life and the Human Somatic Niche, , London, Bloomsbury; Brunton, F., Nissenbaum, H., (2011) Vernacular Resistance to Data Collection and Analysis: A Political Theory of Obfuscation, 16. , http://firstmonday.org/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/3493, First Monday, (accessed 18 September 2017); Coole, D., Agentic capacities and capacious historical materialism: Thinking with new materialisms in the political sciences (2013) Millennium, 41, pp. 451-469; Fors, V., Pink, S., Pedagogy as possibility: Health interventions as digital openness (2017) Social Sciences, 6. , http://www.mdpi.com/2076-0760/6/2/59/htm, and,.;, (, accessed 1 March 2018; Frank, M., Walker, J., Attard, J., Data literacy – What is it and how can we make it happen?

It traces how repeated encounters with digital data operate to naturalise these entities, while often blindsiding their agentive properties and the ways they get implicated in processes of exploitation and governance. I propose and develop the notion of ‘data doxa’ to conceptualise the way in which digital data – and the devices and platforms that stage data – have come to be perceived in Western societies as normal, necessary and enabling. The ‘data doxa’ concept also accentuates the enculturation of many individuals into a data sharing habitus which frames digital technologies in simplistic terms as (a) panaceas for the problems associated with contemporary life, (b) figures of progress and convenience, and (c) mediums of knowledge, pleasure and identity. I suggest that three types of data-based relations contribute to the formation of this doxic sensibility: fetishisation, habit and enchantment. Each of these relations come to mediate public understandings of digital devices and the data they generate, obscuring the multifaceted nature and hidden depths of data and their propensity to double up as technologies of exposure and discipline. As a result of this situation, imaginative educational programs and revamped regulatory frameworks are urgently needed to inform individuals about the contribution of data to the leveraging of value and power in today's digital economies, but also to protect them from experiencing data-based harms. © The Author(s) 2018.",data doxa; data sharing; governance; habit; Public understandings of data; surveillance,,,,,,,,,"Andrejevic, M., (2004) Reality TV: The Work of Being Watched, , Oxford, Rowman and Littlefield; Andrejevic, M., Privacy, exploitation, and the digital enclosure (2009) Amsterdam Law Forum, 1 (4), pp. 47-62; Andrejevic, M., (2013) Infoglut: How Too Much Information is Changing the Way We Think and Know, , Abingdon Oxon, Routledge; Barnes, S.B., A privacy paradox: Social networking in the United States (2006) First Monday, 11 (9). , http://firstmonday.org/issues/issue11_9/barnes/index.html, (accessed 20 August 2017); Bauman, Z., (2006) Liquid Fear, , Cambridge, Polity Press; Bauman, Z., Lyon, D., (2012) Liquid Surveillance: A Conversation, , Cambridge, Polity Press; Beer, D., The social power of algorithms (2017) Information, Communication & Society, 20 (1), pp. 1-13; Bourdieu, P., (1990) In Other Words: Essays Towards a Reflexive Sociology, , Redwood City, CA, Stanford University Press; Bourdieu, P., Eagleton, T., Doxa and common life (1992) New Left Review, 199, pp. 111-121; Boyd, D., Crawford, K., Critical questions for big data.

We use examples drawn from our Science and Technology Studies (STS) analyses of -omic biology and high energy physics to demonstrate the utility of three theoretical concepts: (i) primary and secondary inscriptions, (ii) crafted and found data, and (iii) the locus of legitimate interpretation. These help us to show how the histories, organisational forms, and power dynamics of a field lead to different enactments of big data. The paper suggests that these concepts can be used to help us to understand the ways in which Big Data is being enacted in the domain of the social sciences, and to outline in general terms the ways in which this enactment might be different to that which we have observed in the ‘hard’ sciences. We contend that the locus of legitimate interpretation of Big Data biology and physics is tightly delineated, found within the disciplinary institutions and cultures of these disciplines. We suggest that when using Big Data to make knowledge claims about ‘the social’ the locus of legitimate interpretation is more diffuse, with knowledge claims that are treated as being credible made from other disciplines, or even by those outside academia entirely. © The Author(s) 2018.",big data; Bioinformatics; epistemic culture; locus of legitimate interpretation; physics; social science,,,,,,"Economic and Social Research Council, ESRC

A smooth and seamless work experience has been the goal to strive for. Based on document analysis and interviews with 15 stakeholders, we trace the setting up of a data infrastructure in Danish General Practice that had achieved just this goal – only to end in a scandal and subsequent loss of public support. The ease of data access made it possible for data to be extracted, exchanged and used by new actors and for new purposes – without those producing the data fully realizing the expansion of the infrastructure. We suggest that the case has wider relevance for a still more data-intensive healthcare sector and a growing data economy: when those who produce the data are not made aware of new uses of data, it makes it more difficult to resolve potential conflicts along the way. In the Danish case, conflicting views on legitimate data use led to the collapse of the infrastructure. Therefore, while seamlessness may be a solution to the old problem of a poor fit between user and technology, this celebrated virtue may also involve new problems relating to social instability. As digital solutions tend to be integrated still more seamlessly in still more of our activities, we need to develop political mechanisms to define and protect the rights and obligations of both data suppliers and users in order to ensure the long-term sustainability of digital infrastructures. © The Author(s) 2018.",Denmark; digital fit; electronic medical record; infrastructure; seamlessness; sustainability,,,,,,,,,"Berg, M., Goorman, E., The contextual nature of medical information (1999) International Journal of Medical Informatics, 56, pp. 51-60; Bowker, G.C., Baker, K., Millerand, F., Towards information infrastructure studies: Ways of knowing in a networked environment (2010) International Handbook of Internet Research, pp. 97-117. , Hunsiger J., Klastrup L., Allen M., (eds), London, Springer, In:, (eds; Bowker, G.C., Star, S.L., (2000) Sorting Things Out: Classifications and Its Consequences, , Cambridge, MIT Press, 1999, (, [,]; Boysen, M., (2011) PLO: Tvungen Datafangst Er Tegn på Overskud I En Krisetid [Homepage of Dagens Medicin], , http://dagensmedicin.dk/plo-tvungen-datafangst-er-tegn-pa-overskud-i-en-krisetid/, (accessed 25 May 2017); Carter, P., Laurie, G.T., Dixon-Woods, M., The social licence for research: Why care.data ran into trouble (2015) Journal of Medical Ethics, 41 (5), pp. 404-409; Cool, A., Detaching data from the state: Biobanking and building Big Data in Sweden (2016) BioSocieties, 11 (3), pp. 277-295; Creemers, R., (2016) Disrupting the Chinese state: New actors and new factors.

Perceptions of algorithms, regardless of the algorithms' actual performance, can significantly influence their adoption, yet we do not fully understand how people perceive decisions made by algorithms as compared with decisions made by humans. To explore perceptions of algorithmic management, we conducted an online experiment using four managerial decisions that required either mechanical or human skills. We manipulated the decision-maker (algorithmic or human), and measured perceived fairness, trust, and emotional response. With the mechanical tasks, algorithmic and human-made decisions were perceived as equally fair and trustworthy and evoked similar emotions; however, human managers' fairness and trustworthiness were attributed to the manager's authority, whereas algorithms' fairness and trustworthiness were attributed to their perceived efficiency and objectivity. Human decisions evoked some positive emotion due to the possibility of social recognition, whereas algorithmic decisions generated a more mixed response – algorithms were seen as helpful tools but also possible tracking mechanisms. With the human tasks, algorithmic decisions were perceived as less fair and trustworthy and evoked more negative emotion than human decisions. Algorithms' perceived lack of intuition and subjective judgment capabilities contributed to the lower fairness and trustworthiness judgments. Positive emotion from human decisions was attributed to social recognition, while negative emotion from algorithmic decisions was attributed to the dehumanizing experience of being evaluated by machines. This work reveals people's lay concepts of algorithmic versus human decisions in a management context and suggests that task characteristics matter in understanding people's experiences with algorithmic technologies. © The Author(s) 2018.",Algorithmic management; emotion; fairness; folk theory; perception; trust,,,,,,,,,"Amino, , https://amino.com, (accessed 13 February 2018); Azadeh, A., Saberi, M., Rouzbahman, M., An intelligent algorithm for performance evaluation of job stress and HSE factors in petrochemical plants with noise and uncertainty (2013) Journal of Loss Prevention in the Process Industries, 26 (1), pp. 140-152; Babcock, L., Loewenstein, G., Issacharoff, S., Biased judgments of fairness in bargaining (1995) The American Economic Review, 85 (5), pp. 1337-1343; Barocas, S., Selbst, A.D., Big data's disparate impact (2016) California Law Review, 104 (3), pp. 671-732; Berinsky, A.J., Huber, G.A., Lenz, G.S., Evaluating online labor markets for experimental research: Amazon.com's Mechanical Turk (2012) Political Analysis, 20 (3), pp. 351-368; Brockner, J., Konovsky, M., Cooper-Schneider, R., Interactive effects of procedural justice and outcome negativity on victims and survivors of job loss (1994) Academy of Management Journal, 37 (2), pp. 397-409; Bucher, T., The algorithmic imaginary: Exploring the ordinary affects of Facebook algorithms (2016) Information, Communication & Society, 201, pp. 1-15; Carey, D., Smith, M., How companies are using simulations, competitions, and analytics to hire (2016) Harvard Business Review, , https://hbr.org/2016/04/how-companies-are-using-simulations-competitions-and-analytics-to-hire, accessed 13 February 2018; Clark, H., (1996) Using Language, , Cambridge, Cambridge University Press; Cloud 9 Psych, , http://www.cloud9psych.com, (accessed 13 February 2018); Crawford, K., Calo, R., There is a blind spot in AI research (2016) Nature, 538 (7625), pp. 311-313; Dietvorst, B.J., Simmons, J.P., Massey, C., Algorithm aversion: People erroneously avoid algorithms after seeing them err (2015) Journal of Experimental Psychology: General, 144 (1), pp. 114-126; Egelman, S., Peer, E., Scaling the security wall: Developing a Security Behavior Intentions Scale (SeBIS) (2015) Proceedings of the 33Rd Annual ACM Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems, pp. 2873-2882. , Seoul, South Korea; Algorithms in the Criminal Justice System, , https://epic.org/algorithmic-transparency/crim-justice, (accessed 13 February 2018); Eslami, M., Rickman, A., Vaccaro, K., I always assumed that I wasn’t really that close to [her]: Reasoning about invisible algorithms in the news feed (2015) Proceedings of the 33Rd Annual SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems, pp. 153-162; Fogg, B., Nass, C., Silicon sycophants: The effects of computers that flatter (1997) International Journal of Human–Computer Studies, 46 (5), pp. 551-561; French, M., Hancock, J., What's the folk theory?

This paper examines how algorithms and data-driven technologies, enacted by an organization like Facebook, can induce similarity across an industry. Using theories from organizational sociology and neoinstitutionalism, this paper traces the bureaucratic roots of Big Data and algorithms to examine the institutional dependencies that emerge and are mediated through data-driven and algorithmic logics. This type of analysis sheds light on how organizational contexts are embedded into algorithms, which can then become embedded within other organizational and individual practices. By investigating technical practices as organizational and bureaucratic, discussions about accountability and decision-making can be reframed. © The Author(s) 2018.",accountability; Algorithms; bureaucracy; Facebook; institutional theory; isomorphism,,,,,,"Stanford University, SU","We thank Philip M Napoli, CW Anderson, Emmanuel Moss, and our anonymous reviewers for their generous feedback on this paper.

Here and in many other contexts, data literacy is characterised in terms of a combination of numerical, statistical and technical capacities. In this article, we argue for an expansion of the concept to include not just competencies in reading and working with datasets but also the ability to account for, intervene around and participate in the wider socio-technical infrastructures through which data is created, stored and analysed – which we call “data infrastructure literacy”. We illustrate this notion with examples of “inventive data practice” from previous and ongoing research on open data, online platforms, data journalism and data activism. Drawing on these perspectives, we argue that data literacy initiatives might cultivate sensibilities not only for data science but also for data sociology, data politics as well as wider public engagement with digital data infrastructures. The proposed notion of data infrastructure literacy is intended to make space for collective inquiry, experimentation, imagination and intervention around data in educational programmes and beyond, including how data infrastructures can be challenged, contested, reshaped and repurposed to align with interests and publics other than those originally intended. © The Author(s) 2018.",critical data studies; data activism; data critique; Data infrastructures; data journalism; data literacy; data publics; data worlds; digital methods; information infrastructure studies; science and technology studies,,,,,,"Universiteit van Amsterdam, UvA",We are grateful to the Media of Calculation Research Group and the Digital Methods Initiative at the University of Amsterdam for the opportunities to discuss and develop this work ? as well as to participants at the Digital Methods Mini-Conference 2016 and 4S/EASST in Barcelona.

In this article we explore what data presence means for the ways that the everyday is organised, sensed, and anticipated. While digital data studies have demonstrated how data is deeply entangled with the way in which everyday life is lived out and valued, at the same time our relationships with data are riddled with anxieties or small niggles or tricky trade-offs and their use is often chaotic and muddled, part of the inevitable uncertainty about what will happen next. If the presence of data is part of the environments we inhabit, this raises the question of how and why data is valuable to us and what forms of hope and trust enable this value to further develop. © The Author(s) 2018.",Anticipatory modes; data anxiety; ethnography; everyday life; futures; technology designers,,,,,,,,,"Adams, V., Murphy, M., Clarke, A.E., Anticipation: Technoscience, life, affect, temporality (2009) Subjectivity, 28, pp. 246-265; Anderson, B., Preemption, precaution, preparedness: Anticipatory action and future geographies (2010) Progress in Human Geography, 34 (6), pp. 777-798; Barassi, V., BabyVeillance?

However, a key challenge of analyzing such data is their lower level of individual detail compared to highly detailed survey data. This limits the scope of substantive questions that can be addressed with these data. In this study, we provide a method to upgrade individual detail in terms of ethnicity in data gathered from social media via the use of register data. Our research aim is twofold: first, we predict the most likely value of ethnicity, given one's first name, and second, we show how one can test hypotheses with the predicted values for ethnicity as an independent variable while simultaneously accounting for the uncertainty in these predictions. We apply our method to social network data collected from Facebook. We illustrate our approach and provide an example of hypothesis testing using our procedure, i.e., estimating the relation between predicted network ethnic homogeneity on Facebook and trust in institutions. In a comparison of our method with two other methods, we find that our method provides the most conservative tests of hypotheses. We discuss the promise of our approach and pinpoint future research directions. © The Author(s) 2018.",Big Data; ethnicity; Facebook; first names; prediction; Social networks,,,,,,,,,"Abascal, M., Baldassarri, D., Love thy neighbor?

The making of its properties into data is therefore particularly important to the relations that are formed around electricity as a produced and managed phenomenon. We propose approaching all metering as a situated activity, a form of quantification work in which data is made and becomes mobile in particular spatial and temporal terms, enabling its entry into data infrastructures and schemes of evaluation and value production. We interrogate the transition from the pre-digital into the making of bigger, more spatiotemporally granular electricity data, through focusing on those actors selling and materialising new metering technologies, data infrastructures and services for larger businesses and public sector organisations in the UK. We examine the claims of truth and visibility that accompany these shifts and their enrolment into management techniques that serve to more precisely apportion responsibility for, and evaluate the status of, particular patterns and instances of electricity use. We argue that whilst through becoming Big Data electricity flow is now able to be known and given identity in significantly new terms, enabling new relations to be formed with the many heterogeneous entities implicated in making and managing energy demand, it is necessary to sustain some ambivalence as to the performative consequences that follow for energy governance. We consider the wider application of our conceptualisation of metering, reflecting on comparisons with the introduction of new metering systems in domestic settings and as part of other infrastructural networks. © The Author(s) 2018.",Electricity; measurement; metering; smart energy; spatiotemporal; visibility,,,,,,,,,"Amoore, L., Piotukh, V., Life beyond big data: Governing with little analytics (2015) Economy and Society, 44 (3), pp. 341-366; Ananny, M., Crawford, K., Seeing without knowing: Limitations of the transparency ideal and its application to algorithmic accountability (2016) New Media & Society, , Epub ahead of print 2016, 146144481667664; Arapostathis, S., Meters, patents and expertise(s): Knowledge networks in the electricity meters industry, 1880–1914 (2013) Studies in History and Philosophy of Science, 44, pp. 234-246; Barry, A., The anti-political economy (2005) The Technological Economy, , Barry A and Slater D (eds), Abingdon, Routledge; Bates, J., Lin, Y.-W., Goodale, P., Data journeys: Capturing the socio-material constitution of data objects and flows (2016) Big Data and Society, pp. 1-12; Bedwell, B., Leygue, C., Goulden, M., Apportioning energy consumption in the workplace: A review of issues in using metering data to motivate staff to save energy (2014) Technology Analysis & Strategic Management, 26, pp. 1196-1211; Beer, D., The data analytics industry and the promises of real-time knowing: Perpetuating and deploying a rationality of speed (2017) Journal of Cultural Economy, 10, pp. 21-33; Bell, G., The secret life of Big Data (2015) Data, Now Bigger and Better!, , Boellstorff T., Maurer B., (eds), Chicago, IL, Prickly Paradigm Press, In:, (eds; Bennett, J., (2010) Vibrant Matter: A Political Ecology of Things, , Durham, NC / London, Duke University Press; Boellstorff, T., Maurer, B., (2015) Data.

This article presents a case study of the data storage, sharing, and management platform Figshare. We argue that such platforms are displacing and reconfiguring the infrastructure of norms, technologies, and institutions that underlies traditional scholarly communication. Using a theoretical framework that combines infrastructure studies with platform studies, we show that Figshare leverages the platform logic of core and complementary components to re-integrate a presently splintered scholarly infrastructure. By means of this logic, platforms may provide the path to bring data inside a scholarly communication system still optimized mainly for text publications. Yet the platform strategy also risks turning over critical scientific functions to private firms whose longevity, openness, and corporate goals remain uncertain. It may amplify the existing trend of splintering infrastructures, with attendant effects on equity of service. © The Author(s) 2018.",Application programming interface; Big Data; data sharing; decentralization; infrastructure; integration; library; platform; scholarship,,,,,,,,,"Anderson, C., The end of theory: The data deluge makes the scientific method obsolete (2008) Wired, , https://www.wired.com/2008/06/pb-theory/, 23 June, Available at:, accessed 29 January 2018; Atkins, D., Revolutionizing science and engineering through cyberinfrastructure (2003) Report of the National Science Foundation Blue-Ribbon Advisory Panel on Cyberinfrastructure, , https://arizona.openrepository.com/arizona/handle/10150/106224, (accessed 29 January 2018); Baker, K., Millerand, F., Infrastructure ecology: Challenges in achieving data sharing (2010) Collaboration in the new life sciences, pp. 111-138. , Parker J.N., (ed), Surrey, Ashgate Publishers, In:, (ed; Baldwin, C.Y., Woodard, C.J., (2008) The Architecture of Platforms: A Unified View, , hbswk.hbs.edu/item/6025.html; Borgman, C.L., (2007) Scholarship in the Digital Age: Information.

With such promise, they can transform the ordinary, say snapshots along a robotic vacuum cleaner’s route, into something much more, such as a clean home. Echoing David Graeber’s revision of fetishism, we argue that this easy slip from technical capabilities to broader claims betrays not the “magic” of algorithms but rather the dynamics of their exchange. Fetishes are not indicators of false thinking, but social contracts in material form. They mediate emerging distributions of power often too nascent, too slippery or too disconcerting to directly acknowledge. Drawing primarily on 2016 ethnographic research with computer vision professionals, we show how faith in what algorithms can do shapes the social encounters and exchanges of their production. By analyzing algorithms through the lens of fetishism, we can see the social and economic investment in some people’s labor over others. We also see everyday opportunities for social creativity and change. We conclude that what is problematic about algorithms is not their fetishization but instead their stabilization into full-fledged gods and demons – the more deserving objects of critique. © The Author(s) 2018.",Algorithm; culture; ethnography; exchange; fetish; social contract,,,,,,,,,"Barocas, S., Rosenblat, A., Boyd, D., (2014) Data & Civil Rights: Technology Primer, , http://datasociety.net/output/data-civil-rights-technology-primer/, 30 October, accessed 13 November 2016; Barocas, S., Selbst, A.D., Big Data’s disparate impact (2016) California Law Review, 671 (104). , http://www.californialawreview.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/2Barocas-Selbst.pdf, accessed 9 January 2017; Berson, J., (2015) Computable Bodies: Instrumented Life and the Human Somatic Niche, , London, UK, Bloomsbury Academic; Burrell, J., How the machine ‘thinks’: Understanding opacity in machine learning algorithms (2016) Big Data & Society, 3 (1). , http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/2053951715622512, (,):. :, (accessed 25 December 2017; Chun, W., On “sourcery,” or code as fetish (2008) Configurations, 16 (3), pp. 299-324; Dougherty, N., Mindfulness pills (2011) Quantifiedself.Com, , http://quantifiedself.com/2011/08/nancy-dougherty-on-mindfulness-pills/, 7 August, Available at:, accessed 11 November 2016; Dourish, P., Algorithms and their others: Algorithmic culture in context (2016) Big Data & Society, 3 (2), pp. 1-11. , http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/2053951716665128, (accessed 11 March 2017); Engeström, Y., Miettinen, R., Introduction (1999) Perspectives on Activity Theory, pp. 1-16. , Engeström Y., Miettinen R., Punamäki R.L., (eds), Cambridge, Cambridge University Press, In:, (eds; Freud, S., Fetishism (1927) The Complete Psychological Works of Sigmund Freud, 21, pp. 147-157. , Strachey J, London, Hogarth and the Institute for Psychoanalysis; Gillespie, T., The relevance of algorithms (2014) Media Technologies: Essays on Communication, Materiality, and Society, pp. 167-194. , Gillespie T., Boczkowski P., Foot K., (eds), Cambridge, MA, MIT Press, In:, (eds; Goodwin, C., Professional vision (1994) American Anthropologist, 96 (3), pp. 606-633; Graeber, D., Fetishism as social creativity: Or, Fetishes are gods in the process of construction (2005) Anthropological Theory, 5 (4), pp. 407-438; Gray, M.L., Sur, S., Shoaib, S., The crowd is a collaborative network (2016) Computer-Supported Cooperative Work and Social Computing, , San Francisco, CA, 27 February–2 March 2016; Hamilton, K., Karahalios, K., Sandvig, C., A path to understanding the effects of algorithm awareness (2014) Human Factors in Computing Systems (CHI), pp. 631-642. , Toronto, Ontario, Canada, 26 April–1 May 2014, New York, ACM Press; Irani, L., Justice for ‘Data Janitors (2015) Public Books, , www.publicbooks.org/nonfiction/justice-for-data-janitors, accessed 11 November 2016; Kitchin, R., Lauriault, T., Towards critical data studies: Charting and unpacking data assemblages and their work (2014) Geoweb and Big Data, , https://ssrn.com/abstract=2474112, Eckert J, Shears A and Thatcher J (eds), Lincoln, NE: University of Nebraska Press.

We call for in-depth investigation of the human experiences, routines, improvisations and accomplishments which implicate digital data in the flow of the everyday. We demonstrate the value of this approach through a discussion of our ethnographic research with self-tracking cycling commuters. We argue that such investigations are crucial in informing our understandings of how digital data become meaningful in mundane contexts of everyday life for two reasons: first because there is a gap in our understanding of the contingencies and specificities through which big digital data sets are produced, and second because designers and policy makers often seek to make interventions for change in everyday contexts through the presentation of mundane data to consumers but with little understanding of how people produce, experience and engage with these data. © The Author(s) 2017.",Digital living; ethnography; improvisation; mundane data; routine; self-tracking,,,,,,,,,"Baym, N., (2015) Personal Connections in the Digital Age, , 2nd ed.

In many instances, online publication will be treated by the courts in a similar fashion to traditional forms of publication. What is more contentious is the question of who, if anyone, should bear the responsibility for digital forms of defamatory publication which result not from an individual author’s activity online but rather from algorithmic associations. This article seeks, in part, to analyse this question, by reference to the Australian case law and associated scholarship regarding search engine liability. Reflecting on the tensions involved here offers us a fresh perspective on defamation law through the conceptual lens of data associations. Here the focus of the article shifts to explore some wider questions posed for defamation law by big data. Defamation law may come to play a significant role in emerging frameworks for algorithmic accountability, but these developments also call into question many of its traditional concepts and assumptions. It may be time to think differently about defamation and to consider its interrelationship with privacy, speech and data protection more fully. As a result, I conclude that the courts and policymakers need to engage more deeply and explicitly with the rationale(s) for the protection of reputation and that more thought needs to be given to changing conceptions of reputation in the context of data associations. © The Author(s) 2017.",algorithms; automaticity; Data associations; defamation law; reputation; search engines,,,,,,,,,"Aplin, T.F., Bosland, J., The uncertain landscape of Article 8 of the ECHR: The protection of reputation as a fundamental human right?

Yet the data revolution is so far primarily a technical one: the power of data to sort, categorise and intervene has not yet been explicitly connected to a social justice agenda by the agencies and authorities involved. Meanwhile, although data-driven discrimination is advancing at a similar pace to data processing technologies, awareness and mechanisms for combating it are not. This paper posits that just as an idea of justice is needed in order to establish the rule of law, an idea of data justice – fairness in the way people are made visible, represented and treated as a result of their production of digital data – is necessary to determine ethical paths through a datafying world. Bringing together the emerging scholarly perspectives on this topic, I propose three pillars as the basis of a notion of international data justice: (in)visibility, (dis)engagement with technology and antidiscrimination. These pillars integrate positive with negative rights and freedoms, and by doing so challenge both the basis of current data protection regulations and the growing assumption that being visible through the data we emit is part of the contemporary social contract. © The Author(s) 2017.",development; discrimination; ethics; Privacy; representation; surveillance,,,,,,"Seventh Framework Programme, FP7: ESR-624583

Seminar I attended in 2014–2016. There is a real demand for action taking. I took advantage of the knowledge I learned from the Data-Psst seminars and devised a module teaching Level 5 undergraduate media students about critical issues in today’s data-centric digital society, including privacy and surveillance. In this article, I share how the class activities were devised and carried out, and how guided engagement with the current debate in privacy and surveillance were realised. I also draw on relevant pedagogical theories to discuss my educational approaches, student performance, the challenges of the project, and evaluate and reflect upon the outcomes. This report from the field provides fresh first-hand information about the data ethics of the younger public who are practising media arts and their behaviours and attitudes towards privacy and surveillance. This article shall open up the discussion about the role educators play in enriching public engagement with critical thinking about Big Data. The lessons learned can also contextualise the pedagogical implication of the recent scholarly research on Big Data and privacy, and provide a framework for constructing future collaborative or creative projects. © The Author(s) 2017.",Artivism; data literacy; higher education; pedagogy; privacy; surveillance,,,,,,,,,"(2013), Alternative Christmas Message by Edward Snowden, Channel 4; Anderson, L.W., Krathwohl, D., (2001) A Taxonomy for Learning, Teaching, and Assessing: A Revision of Bloom's Taxonomy of Educational Objectives, , New York, NY, Longman; Bakir, V., Cable, J., Dencik, L., (2015) Public feeling on privacy, security and surveillance: a report by DATA-PSST and DCSS, , http://orca.cf.ac.uk/87335/, Project Report, Cardiff University and Bangor University. : (accessed 1 November 2016; Barton, G.M., The arts and literacy: Interpretation and expression of symbolic form (2014) Literacy in the Arts: Retheorising Learning and Teaching, pp. 3-20. , Barton G.M., (ed), Zurich, Switzerland, Springer International Publishing, In:, (ed; Biggs, J.B., (1999) Teaching for Quality Learning at University, , Buckingham, Open University Press; Biggs, J.B., (2003) Teaching for Quality Learning at University, , 2nd ed, Buckingham, Open University Press/Society for Research into Higher Education; Bloom, B., Englehart, M., Furst, E., (1956) Taxonomy of Educational Objectives: The Classification of Educational Goals.

We define “user-generated health data” as data captured through devices or software (whether purpose built or commercially available) and used outside of traditional clinical settings for tracking personal health data. The investigators conducted qualitative research through semistructured interviews (n = 32) with researchers, health technology start-up companies, and members of the general public to inquire why and how they interact with and understand the value of user-generated health data. We found significant results concerning new attitudes toward trust, privacy, and sharing of health data outside of clinical settings that conflict with regulations governing health data within clinical settings. Members of the general public expressed little concern about sharing health data with the companies that sold the devices or apps they used, and indicated that they rarely read the “terms and conditions” detailing how their data may be exploited by the company or third-party affiliates before consenting to them. In contrast, interviews with researchers revealed significant resistance among potential research participants to sharing their user-generated health data for purposes of scientific study. The widespread rhetoric of personalization and social sharing in “user-generated culture” appears to facilitate an understanding of user-generated health data that deemphasizes the risk of exploitation in favor of loosely defined benefits to individual and social well-being.

Rather than asking what Big Data really is or is not, it deals with the discursive work that goes into making Big Data a socially relevant phenomenon and problem in the first place. It starts from the idea that in modern societies the public understanding of technology is largely driven by a media-based discourse, which is a key arena for circulating collectively shared meanings. This largely ignored dimension invites us to appreciate what matters to journalists and the wider public when discussing the collection and use of data. To this end, our study looks at how Big Data is framed in terms of the governmental use of large datasets as a contentious area of data application. It reconstructs the perspectives surrounding the so-called “Handygate” affair in Germany based on broadcast news and social media conversations. In this incident, state authorities collected and analyzed mobile phone data through a radio cell query during events to commemorate the Dresden bombing in February 2011. We employ a qualitative discourse analysis that allows us to reconstruct the conceptualizations of Big Data as a proper instrument for criminal prosecution or an unjustified infringement of constitutional rights. © The Author(s) 2017.",German media; Handygate; Media discourse; media framing; public understanding of Big Data; radio cell query,,,,,,,,,"Andrejevic, M., The Big Data divide (2014) International Journal of Communication, 8, pp. 1673-1689; Beer, D., How should we do the history of Big Data?

Forty library partners and billions of scanned pages later, Google Book Search has provided searchable text access to millions of books. While many details of Google’s conversion processes remain proprietary secret, here we piece together their general outlines by closely examining Google Book Search products, Google patents, and the entanglement of libraries and computer scientists in the longer history of digitization work. We argue that far from simply “scanning” books, Google’s efforts may be characterized as algorithmic digitization, strongly shaped by an equation of digital access with full-text searchability. We explore the consequences of Google’s algorithmic digitization system for what end users ultimately do and do not see, placing these effects in the context of the multiple technical, material, and legal challenges surrounding Google Book Search. By approaching digitization primarily as a text extraction and indexing challenge—an effort to convert print books into electronically searchable data—GBS enacts one possible future for books, in which they are defined largely by their textual content. © The Author(s) 2017.",algorithmic culture; Algorithmic system; digitization; Google; scanning; web search,,,,,,,,,"Baird, H.S., Digital libraries and document image analysis (2003) Seventh International Conference on Document Analysis and Recognition, pp. 2-14. , Los Alamitos, CA, IEEE; Band, J., The long and winding road to the Google Books settlement (2009) The John Marshall Review of Intellectual Property Law, 9 (2), pp. 227-329; Bowker, G.C., Biodiversity datadiversity (2000) Social Studies of Science, 30 (5), pp. 643-683; Cadwalladr, C., How to bump Holocaust deniers off Google’s top spot?

This paper is concerned with the relationship between increased surveillance capacity and state power. The paper begins by analysing two metaphors used in public post Snowden discourse to describe state surveillance practices: the haystack and the panopticon. It argues that these metaphors share a flawed common entailment regarding surveillance, knowledge and power which cannot accurately capture important aspects of state anxiety generated by mass surveillance in an age of big data. The paper shows that the nature of big data itself complicates the power attributed to mass surveillance states by these metaphors and those who use them. Relying heavily on Ezrahi’s distinction between information and knowledge, the paper situates this argument concerning the state and anxiety borne of information overload in the context of literature that concerns the state and information management. Drawing primarily on James Scott’s work on legibility, it argues that the big data born of mass surveillance problematises the concept of information as empowering the state. Instead, understanding mass surveillance in an age of big data requires understanding the relationship between the surveillance state and information in terms of anxiety as well as power. © The Author(s) 2017.",intelligence; panopticon; risk; Snowden; Surveillance; terrorism,,,,,,,,,"Alexander, K., Evidence before the United States Senate Select Committee on Intelligence (2013) Hearing on Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) Legislation, , Washington DC, USA, 26 September; Alexander, K., Keynote presentation (2013) Black Hat USA 2013, , https://www.nsa.gov/news-features/speeches-testimonies/speeches/transcript-of-gen-alexander-black-hat-speech-31july2013.shtml, Las Vegas, USA, 27 July–1 August; Alexander, K., Keynote presentation slides (2013) Black Hat USA 2013, , https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/802262/us-13-alexander-keynote.pdf, Las Vegas, USA, 27 July–1 August, accessed 1 October 2015); Alexander, K., Evidence before the United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary (2013) Continued Oversight of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, , Washington DC, USA, 2 October; Amoore, L., De Goede, M., Governance, risk and dataveillance in the war on terror (2005) Crime, Law and Social Change, Vol 43 (2-3), pp. 149-173; Aradau, C., Blanke, T., The (big) data-security assemblage: Knowledge and critique (2015) Big Data & Society, pp. 1-12; Aradau, C., Van Munster, R., Governing terrorism through risk: Taking precautions, (un)knowing the Future (2007) European Journal of International Relations, 13 (1), pp. 89-115; Atran, S., Axelrod, R., Davis, R., Challenges in researching terrorism from the field (2017) Science, 355 (6323), pp. 352-354; Ball, K., Workplace surveillance: An overview (2010) Labor History, 51 (1), pp. 87-106; Bergman, L., Lightblau, E., Shane, S., (2006) Spy Agency after September 11 Led FBI to Dead Ends, , http://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/17/us/front%20page/domestic-surveillance-the-program-spy-agency-data-after-sept.html, The New York Times; Betz, D., Stevens, T., Analogical reasoning and cyber security (2013) Security Dialogue, 44 (2), pp. 147-164; Bijker, W., Hughes, T., Pinch, T., (1987) The Social Construction of Technological Systems: New Directions in the Sociology and History of Technology, , 2nd ed, Cambridge, MIT Press; Bobrow, D., Complex insecurity: Implications of a sobering metaphor: 1996 presidential address (1996) International Studies Quarterly, 40 (4), pp. 435-450; Boyd, D., Crawford, K., Critical questions for big data: Provocations for a cultural, technological, and scholarly phenomenon (2012) Information, Communication and Society, 15 (5), pp. 662-679; Cahall, B., Schneider, E., Bergen, P., (2014) Do NSA’s Bulk Surveillance Programs Stop Terrorists?, , Report, The New America Foundation, Washington, DC, January; Calmes, J., Obama says surveillance helped case in (2013) Germany. the New York Times, , http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/20/world/europe/obama-in-germany.html?mcubz=1; Caluya, G., The post-panoptic society?

By cross referencing visitor IP addresses with available online data sources, the work traces each visitor back through the network to its possible origin. The end of that trace is the closest available image that potentially shows the visitor’s physical environment. Sometimes what this image shows is eerily accurate; other times it is wildly dislocated. This computational surveillance system thus makes transparent the potential visibility of one’s present location on the Earth, while also giving each site visitor the ability to watch other visitor “traces” in real time. By making its surveillance capacity and intention overt, Tracing You provokes questions about the architecture of networks and how that architecture affects our own visibility both within and outside of the network. Further, reactions to the work reveal attitudes towards surveillance post-Snowden, including, in some cases, an angry desire for more visibility than Tracing You currently provides. This commentary describes how the artwork functions, presents and discusses visitor reactions, and briefly theorizes origins for these reactions within the contexts of surveillance, sousveillance, and transparency in the age of ubiquitous online social networks. © The Author(s) 2017.",Big Data; new media art; Surveillance; transparency; veillance; visibility,,,,,,,,,"Beele, D., Voor mij dus een dikke fail voor dit kunstproject (2016) Het Doet Niet Wat Het belooft… Facebook Comment, , https://www.facebook.com/thecreatorsprojectnederland/posts/754014701371591?comment_id=754030198036708&comment_tracking=%7B%22tn%22%3A%22R6%22%7D, (accessed 1 November 2016); Bucher, T., Want to be on the top?

Data, when applied to a system of accountability, produced new capabilities and powers, and as such were political. It created second-hand representations of important objects of analysis. Using these representations administrators spoke on behalf of the school, the student and the classroom, without having to rely on the first-person accounts of students, teachers or principals. They empowered one group—central city administrators—over another—teachers and principals. After analyzing the form these policies took, this article concludes that it is necessary to rethink the processes that create visibility and invisibility. Public data obscured the voices, experiences and collective traumas of students and faculty within the school. A narrow focus on activities within the schools rendered invisible the structural decisions made by the Department of Education in New York City—to favor small schools over large, comprehensive ones. In order to create understanding, and a sense of common purpose, those who are spoken for in simplified data must also be given the opportunity to debate the representations of their performance and quality. © The Author(s) 2017.",Accountability; Actor-network Theory; deliberation; governance; school closure; school evaluation,,,,,,,,,"Barry, A., The anti-political economy (2005) The Technological Economy, , Barry A., Slater D., (eds), London, Routledge, In:, (eds; Bloom, H., Unterman, R., (2013) Sustained Progress: New Findings about the Effectiveness and Operation of Small Public High Schools of Choice in New York City, MDRC; Bowker, G., Star, S.L., (1999) Sorting Things Out: Classification and Its Consequences, , Cambridge, MA, MIT Press; Callon, M., Some elements of a sociology of translation: Domestication of the scallops and fisherman of St. Brieuc Bay (1986) Power, Action and Belief: A New Sociology of Knowledge?, pp. 196-223. , New York, NY, Routledge; Callon, M., Pierre, L., Yannick, B., (2009) Acting in An Uncertain World: An Essay on Technical Democracy (Graham Burchell, Transl.), , Cambridge, MA: The MIT Press; Disch, L., Representation as ‘Spokespersonship’: Bruno Latour’s political theory (2008) Parallax, 143, pp. 88-100; On schools, listen this time (2010) The New York Times, , 1 April; Favero, N., Meier, K., Evaluating urban public schools: Parents teachers and state assessments (2015) Public Administration Review, 73 (3), pp. 401-412; Fischer, F., (1990) Technocracy and the Politics of Expertise, , London, Sage; Flyvbjerg, B., (1998) Rationality and Power: Democracy in Practice, , Chicago, IL, The University of Chicago Press; Flyvbjerg, B., (2001) Making Social Science Matter: Why Social Inquiry Fails and How It Can Succeed Again, , Cambridge, Cambridge University Press; Fung, A., Graham, M., Weil, D., (2007) Full Disclosure: The Perils and Promise of Transparency, , New York, NY, Cambridge University Press; Gandy, M., Cyborg urbanization: Complexity and monstrosity in the contemporary city (2005) International Journal of Urban and Regional Research, 29 (1), pp. 26-49; Henig, J., Gold, E., Orr, M., Parent and community engagement and the sustainability challenge for urban education reform (2011) Education Reform in New York City: Ambitious Change in the Nation’s Most Complex School System, pp. 33-54. , O’Day J., Bitter L., Gomez L., (eds), Cambridge, MA, Harvard Education Press, In:, (eds; Hess, F., (1999) Spinning Wheels: The Politics of Urban School Reform, , Washington, DC, Brookings Institution Press; Jennings, J., School choice or schools’ choice?

Science, finance, journalism, warfare, and policing—there is hardly anything these days that has not been specified as “algorithmic.” Yet, although the trope has brought together a variety of audiences, it is not quite clear what kind of work it does. Often portrayed as powerful yet inscrutable entities, algorithms maintain an air of mystery that makes them both interesting and difficult to understand. This article takes on this problem and examines the role of algorithms not as techno-scientific objects to be known, but as a figure that is used for making sense of observations. Following in the footsteps of Harold Garfinkel’s tutorial cases, I shall illustrate the implications of this view through an experiment with algorithmic navigation. Challenging participants to go on a walk, guided not by maps or GPS but by an algorithm developed on the spot, I highlight a number of dynamics typical of reasoning with running code, including the ongoing respecification of rules and observations, the stickiness of the procedure, and the selective invocation of the algorithm as an intelligible object. The materials thus provide an opportunity to rethink key issues at the intersection of the social sciences and the computational, including popular concerns with transparency, accountability, and ethics. © The Author(s) 2017.",algorithm; code; ethnomethodology; Experiment; practical reasoning; walking,,,,,,"Society of Thoracic Surgeons, STS","This article benefited from generous feedback at the Symposium on ?Knowledge Machines between Freedom and Control? in Hainburg, Austria (2011), the Annual Meeting of the Society for the Social Studies of Science in Copenhagen (2012), the Science Studies Research Group and the Information Science Colloquium at Cornell (2014), as well as the UC Berkeley CSTMS Master Class (2015).

This article chronicles the collaboration between a team of anthropologists and sociologists, who worked together for one week in an experimental attempt to combine ‘big’ transactional and ‘small’ ethnographic data formats. Our collaboration is part of a larger cross-disciplinary project carried out at the Danish Technical University (DTU), where high-resolution transactional data from smartphones allows for recordings of social networks amongst a freshman class (N = 800). With a parallel deployment of ethnographic fieldwork among the DTU students, this research set-up raises a number of questions concerning how to assemble disparate ‘data-worlds’ and to what epistemological and political effects? To address these questions, a specific social event – a lively student party – was singled out from the broader DTU dataset. Our experimental collaboration used recordings of Bluetooth signals between students’ phones to visualize the ebb and flow of social intensities at the DTU party, juxtaposing these with ethnographic field-notes on shifting party atmospheres. Tracing and reflecting on the process of combining heterogeneous data, the article offers a concrete case of how a ‘stitching together’ of digital and ethnographic data-worlds might take place. © The Author(s) 2017.",Big social data; complementarity; data-worlds; ethnography; experiment; party sociality,,,,,,"Københavns Universitet, KU","The authors gratefully acknowledge the University of Copenhagen (UCPH) centre of excellence grant Social Fabric (socialfabric.ku.dk), headed by economist David Dreyer-Lassen; as well as the Villum Foundation Grant Sensible DTU (sensible.dtu.dk), headed by physicist and computer scientist Sune Lehmann Jørgensen.

However, the ubiquitous collection of personal data and Big Data analytics present increasing challenges to successful privacy management. A number of services and research initiatives have proposed similar solutions to provide people with more control over their data by consolidating consent decisions under a single interface. We have named this the ‘consent intermediary’ approach. In this paper, we first identify the eight obstacles to privacy self-management which make cost–benefit analysis conceptually and practically challenging. We then analyse to which extent consent intermediaries can help overcome the obstacles. We argue that simply bringing consent decisions under one interface offers limited help, but that the potential of this approach lies in leveraging the intermediary position to provide aides for privacy management. We find that with suitable tools, some of the more practical obstacles indeed can become solvable, while others remain fundamentally insuperable within the individuated privacy self-management model. Attention should also be paid to how the consent intermediaries may take advantage of the power vested in the intermediary positions between users and other services. © The Author(s) 2017.",consent intermediary; cost–benefit analysis; informed consent; Personal data; privacy; privacy self-management,,,,,,,The authors would like to thank the editors and anonymous reviewers for their constructive feedback on this article.,,"Abiteboul, S., André, B., Kaplan, D., Managing your digital life (2015) Communications of the ACM, 58 (5), pp. 32-35; Acquisti, A., Brandimarte, L., Loewenstein, G., Privacy and human behavior in the age of information (2015) Science, 347 (6221), pp. 509-514; Agarwal, Y., Hall, M., ProtectMyPrivacy: Detecting and mitigating privacy leaks on iOS devices using crowdsourcing (2013) Proceeding of the 11Th Annual International Conference on Mobile Systems, Applications, and Services, Taipei, Taiwan, 25–28 June, pp. 97-110. , New York, ACM; Alba, D., (2015) 23Andme Teams with Big Pharma to Find Treatments Hidden in Our DNA, , Wired; Altman, I., (1975) The Environment and Social Behavior.

The specificity of digital memory is not so much its often discussed inability to forget. What distinguishes digital memory is, instead, its ability to process information without understanding. Algorithms only work with data (i.e. with differences) without remembering or forgetting. Merely calculating, algorithms manage to produce significant results not because they operate in an intelligent way, but because they “parasitically” exploit the intelligence, the memory, and the attribution of meaning by human actors. The specificity of algorithmic processing makes it possible to bypass the paradox of remembering to forget, which up to now blocked any human-based forgetting technique. If you decide to forget some memory, the most immediate effect is drawing attention to it, thereby activating remembering. Working differently from human intelligence, however, algorithms can implement, for the first time, the classical insight that it might be possible to reinforce forgetting not by erasing memories but by multiplying them. After discussing several projects on the web which implicitly adopt this approach, the article concludes by raising some deeper problems posed when algorithms use data and metadata to produce information that cannot be attributed to any human being. © The Author(s) 2017.",algorithms; artificial intelligence; Big Data; memory; privacy; Right to be forgotten,,,,,,"Italian Academy for Advanced Studies in America, Columbia University","Research for this paper was supported by fellowships at the Italian Academy at Columbia University and at the Institute for Advanced Study at the University of Warwick.

Through a pair of linked controversies over scientific access to H5N1 flu virus and genomic data, it examining the duties, obligations, and allocations of authority articulated around the imperative for globally free-flowing information and around the corollary imperative for a science that is set free to produce such information. It argues that scientific regimes are laying claim to a kind of sovereignty, particularly in moments where scientific experts call into question the legitimacy of claims grounded in national sovereignty, by positioning the norms of scientific practice, including a commitment to unfettered access to scientific information and to the authority of science to declare what needs to be known, as essential to global governance. Scientific authority occupies a constitutional position insofar as it figures centrally in the repertoire of imaginaries that shape how a global community is imagined: what binds that community together and what shared political commitments, norms, and subjection to delegated authority are seen as necessary for it to be rightly governed. © The Author(s) 2017.",biosecurity; constitutionalism; global governance; influenza; Pandemic preparedness; science and law,,,,,,,,,"Alberts, B., H5N1 Decisions: Some Important Lessons Learned. presented at: H5N1 Research: Biosafety, biosecurity and bioethics (2012) Royal Society, 6-9, p. 4. , Carlton House Terrace, London, April; Beck, U., (1992) Risk Society: Towards a New Modernity, , London: SAGE Publications Ltd; Bennett, G., The Malicious and the Uncertain: Biosecurity, Self-Justification, and the Arts of Living (2015) Modes of Uncertainty: Anthropological Cases, , Limor Samimian-D, Rabinow P, Chicago, University of Chicago Press; Beck, U., (2009) World at Risk, , London, Polity; Berns, K.I., Casadevall, A., Cohen, M.L., Adaptations of Avian Flu Virus are a cause for concern (2012) Science, 335 (6069), pp. 660-661; Bhattacharya, D., An exploration of conceptual and temporal fallacies in international health law and promotion of global public health preparedness (2007) Journal of Law, Medicine & Ethics, 35 (4), pp. 588-598; Butler, D., Mutant-Flu researcher plans to publish even without permission (2012) Nature News, , April 17; Campbell, P., A Publishing and Editing Perspective.

This has important consequences for the role of conditionality and the idea of individual responsibility in two seemingly unrelated policy areas. First, the changing information infrastructure enables an extension of conditionality in the area of welfare through greater activation, enhanced self-management, and a personalization of risks. Second, conditionality and personal responsibility also form an important ideational template and a legitimatory basis for facilitating value creation that is based on data as a raw material. This argument is illustrated looking at the trajectories of the digital strategies in the United Kingdom and Germany. In both cases, data protection is depicted as a question of individual responsibility and tied to certain forms of individual conduct. © The Author(s) 2017.",conditionality; data protection; Digital economy; individual responsibility; information and communication technologies; value creation,,,,,,,,,"Abdelal, R., Blyth, M., Parsons, C., (2010) Constructing the International Economy, , (eds, Ithaca, NY, Cornell University Press; Akter, S., Wamba, S.F., Big data analytics in E-commerce: A systematic review and agenda for future research (2016) Electronic Markets, 26 (2), pp. 173-194; Ananny, M., Crawford, K., Seeing without knowing: Limitations of the transparency ideal and its application to algorithmic accountability (2016) New Media & Society.

This brings about a new ‘culture’ of statistical modelling that bears considerable potential for the social scientist. This argument is illustrated with a brief discussion of model-based recursive partitioning which can bridge the theory and data-driven approach. Such a method is an example of how this new approach can help revise models that work for the full dataset: it can be used for evaluating different models, a traditional weakness of the ‘traditional’ statistical approach used in social science. © The Author(s) 2017.",Big Data; modelling culture; recursive partitioning; social sciences; statistics,,,,,,,,,"Abbott, A.D., (2001) Time Matters: On Theory and Method, , Chicago, University of Chicago Press; Alvarez, R.M., (2016) Computational Social Science, , Cambridge, Cambridge University Press; Barabasi, A.-L., Posfai, M., (2016) Network Science, , Cambridge, Cambridge University Press; Berk, R.A., An introduction to ensemble methods for data analysis (2006) Sociological Methods & Research, 34 (3), pp. 263-295; Bowker, G.C., Star, S.L., (2008) Sorting Things Out: Classification and its Consequences, , Cambridge, MA, MIT Press; Boyd, D., Crawford, K., Critical questions for Big Data (2012) Information, Communication & Society, 15 (5), pp. 662-679; Breiman, L., Statistical modeling: The two cultures (2001) Statistical Science, 16 (3), pp. 199-231; Burrows, R., Savage, M., After the crisis?

Data collection involves an act of seeing and recording something that was previously hidden and possibly unnamed. The incidences included in a data set are not random or unrelated but stand for coherent, classifiable phenomena in the world. Moreover, for data to have an impact on law and policy, such information must be seen as actionable, that is, the aggregated data must show people both something they can perceive and something that demands interrogation, explanation, or resolution. Actionable data problematize the taken-for-granted order of society by pointing to questions or imbalances that can be corrected or rectified, or simply better understood, through systematic compilations of occurrences, frequencies, distributions, or correlations. The paper describes and analyzes three different modes of authorized seeing that render data on global environmental phenomena such as climate change both visible and actionable. It argues that the political force of environmental data compilations derives from the divergent epistemological standpoints and expert practices associated with producing views from nowhere, everywhere, and somewhere. © The Author(s) 2017.",Algorithm; big data; climate change; coproduction; imaginaries; objectivity,,,,,,,,,"Agarwal, A., Chopra, R., Sharma, K., (1982) The State of India’s Environment 1982: A Citizens’ Report, , New Delhi, Centre for Science and Environment; Agarwal, A., Narain, S., (1991) Global Warming in an Unequal World, , New Delhi, Centre for Science and Environment; Anderson, B., (1983) Imagined Communities: Reflections on the Origin and Spread of Nationalism, Revised Edition, , London, Verso; Anker, P., Buckminster fuller as captain of spaceship earth (2007) Minerva, 45, pp. 417-434; Ashley, R.K., The eye of power: The politics of world modeling (1983) International Organization, 37 (3), pp. 495-535; Biello, D., Negating ‘climategate’: Copenhagen talks and climate science survive stolen e-mail controversy (2010) Scientific American, , http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/negating-climategate/, 1 February, Available at:, accessed January 2017; Bonneuil, C., Fressoz, J.-B., (2016) The Shock of the Anthropocene, , London, Verso; Brandt, A., (2007) The Cigarette Century: The Rise, Fall, and Deadly Persistence of the Product That Defined America, , New York, Basic Books; Cronon, W., A place for stories: Nature, history, and narrative (1992) Journal of American History, 784, pp. 1347-1376; Desrosières, A., How to make things which hold together: Social science, statistics and the state (1991) Discourses on Society: The Shaping of the Social Science Disciplines, pp. 195-218. , Wagner P., Wittrock B., Whitley R., (eds), Dordrecht, Kluwer, In:, (eds; Edwards, P.N., (2010) A Vast Machine: Computer Models, Climate Data, and the Politics of Global Warming, , Cambridge, MIT Press; Espeland, W.N., (1998) The Struggle for Water, , Chicago, IL, University of Chicago Press; Fairhead, J., Leach, M., (1996) Misreading the African Landscape: Society and Ecology in a Forest-Savanna Mosaic, , Cambridge, Cambridge University Press; Forrester, J., If p, then what?

In this article, we map out the ways in which city-scale Internet of Things infrastructures, and their associated networks of sensors, meters, transponders, actuators and algorithms, are used to measure, monitor and regulate the polymorphic temporal rhythms of urban life. Drawing on Lefebvre, and subsequent research, we employ rhythmanalysis in conjunction with Miyazaki’s notion of ‘algorhythm’ and nascent work on algorithmic governance, to develop a concept of ‘algorhythmic governance’. We then use this framing to make sense of two empirical case studies: a traffic management system and sound monitoring and modelling. Our analysis reveals: (1) how smart city technologies computationally perform rhythmanalysis and undertake rhythm-making that intervenes in space-time processes; (2) distinct forms of algorhythmic governance, varying on the basis of adaptiveness, immediacy of action, and whether humans are in-, on-, or, off-the-loop; (3) and a number of factors that shape how algorhythmic governance works in practice. © The Author(s) 2017.",Algorhythm; algorithmic governance; Internet of Things; rhythmanalysis; smart cities; time geography,,,,,,,"We would like to thank our interviewees and the staff of the traffic control room for their help in conducting the empirical research and answering additional questions.

Since 2005, the French police have been using IBM’s computer program, i2 Analyst’s Notebook, to aggregate information and craft criminal narratives. This technology serves to quickly connect suspects with crimes, looking for as many associations as possible, ranking and visualizing them based on level of importance. Recently, surveillance and state power have been theorized as having shifted to a posthegemonic, order. Drawing from literature on power, surveillance, and identity, this paper considers the various ways that algorithms can impact policing under a state of emergency by comparing the technical protocol of i2 Analyst’s Notebook with the administrative protocol of the French state. Using i2 Analyst’s Notebook as an example, this paper argues that posthegemonic theories of power have their place in determining how algorithms can be used for surveillance, but that they cannot completely explain their use under the state of emergency. © The Author(s) 2017.",algorithm; France; i2 Analyst’s Notebook; police; state of emergency; Surveillance,,,,,,,,,"Agamben, G., (1995) Homo Sacer: Sovereign Power and Bare Life, , Stanford, CA, Stanford University Press; Alison, P., Datafication';, Transparency, and Good Governance of the Data City (2014) Digital Enlightenment Forum Yearbook, pp. 215-224. , IOS Press; Amoore, L., Algorithmic war: Everyday geographies of the war on terror (2009) Antipode, 41 (1), pp. 49-69; Azzam, T., Evergreen, S., Germuth, A.A., Data visualization and evaluation (2013) New Directions for Evaluation, , 2013(139): 7–32; Bauman, Z., Lyon, D., (2013) Liquid surveillance: a conversation, , Cambridge, UK; Malden, MA: Polity Press; boyd, D., Crawford, K., Critical questions for big data (2012) Information, Communication, and Society, 15 (5), pp. 662-679; Benbouzid, B., From situational crime prevention to predictive policing (2015) Champ pénal/Penal Field (Vol. XII, , https://champpenal.revues.org/9066, (accessed 26 September 2016); Brakelrosamunde, V., (2016) Pre-Emptive Big Data Surveillance and Its (Dis)Empowering Consequences: The Case of Predictive Policing, , https://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=2772469, SSRN Scholarly Paper.

These systems’ results are often interpreted differently by the designers who created them than by the lay persons who interact with them. This paper offers a proposal for human-centered algorithm design, which incorporates human and social interpretations into the design process for algorithmically based systems. It articulates three specific strategies for doing so: theoretical, participatory, and speculative. Drawing on the author’s work designing and deploying multiple related systems, the paper provides a detailed example of using a theoretical approach. It also discusses findings pertinent to participatory and speculative design approaches. The paper addresses both strengths and challenges for each strategy in helping to center the process of designing algorithmically based systems around humans. © The Author(s) 2017.",Human-centered design; interpretation of algorithms; performance metrics; speculative and critical design; theory,,,,,,,"Thanks to Geri Gay and Francesca Polletta, the investigators on that grant; to our study participants; and to all the student collaborators who made invaluable contributions.

Drawing on work on the performativity of economics, this paper uses two vignettes of the ‘new urban science’ and municipal vacant property mapping in order to argue that the mobilization of Big Data in the urban context doesn’t necessarily produce a single, greater understanding of the city as it actually is, but rather a highly variegated series of essentialized understandings of the city that render it knowable, governable and intervene-able. Through the construction of new, data-driven urban geographical imaginaries, these projects have opened up the space for urban interventions that work to depoliticize urban injustices and valorize new kinds of technical expertise as the means of going about solving these problems, opening up new possibilities for a remaking of urban space in the image of these sociotechnical paradigms. Ultimately, this paper argues that despite the importance of Big Data, as both a discourse and practice, to emerging forms of urban research and management, there is no singular or universal understanding of the urban that is promoted or developed through the application of these new sources of data, which in turn opens up meaningful possibilities for developing alternative uses of Big Data for understanding and intervening in the city in more emancipatory ways. © The Author(s) 2017.",Critical cartography; mapping; performativity; socio-spatial imaginary; urban geography; urban theory,,,,,,,"The author would like to thank Thomas Lodato, Ate Poorthuis, and three anonymous reviewers for their immensely helpful comments on earlier drafts of this paper.",,"Aalbers, M.B., Do maps make geography?

What is more, research data repositories and other research infrastructure and research support institutions are only starting to target social media researchers. In this paper, we present a practical solution to sharing social media data with the help of a social science data archive. Our aim is to contribute to the effort of enhancing comparability and reproducibility in social media research by taking some first steps towards setting standards for sustainable data archiving. We present a showcase for sharing social media data with the example of a big dataset containing geotagged tweets (several months of continued geotagged tweets from the United States from 2014 and 2015; nearly half a billion tweets in total) through a research data archive. We provide a general background to the process of long-term archiving of research data. After some consideration of the current obstacles for sharing and archiving social media data, we present our solution of archiving the specific dataset of geotagged tweets at the GESIS Data Archive for the Social Sciences, a publicly funded German data archive for secure and long-term archiving of social science data. We archived and documented tweet IDs and additional information to improve reproducibility of the initial research while also attending to ethical and legal considerations, and taking into account Twitter’s terms of service in particular. © The Author(s) 2017.",Data archiving; data sharing; ethics; geo-data; social media data; Twitter,,,,,,,We thank the datorium team and especially Thomas Ebel for their very professional and friendly assistance in archiving this dataset.,,"Borgman, C.L., The conundrum of sharing research data (2012) Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology, 63 (6), pp. 1059-1078; Boyd, D., Crawford, K., Critical questions for big data (2012) Information, Communication & Society, 15 (5), pp. 662-679; Bruns, A., Stieglitz, S., Twitter data: What do they represent?

As these algorithmic governance structures proliferate, it is vital that we ensure their effectiveness and legitimacy. That is, we need to ensure that they are an effective means for achieving a legitimate policy goal that are also procedurally fair, open and unbiased. But how can we ensure that algorithmic governance structures are both? This article shares the results of a collective intelligence workshop that addressed exactly this question. The workshop brought together a multidisciplinary group of scholars to consider (a) barriers to legitimate and effective algorithmic governance and (b) the research methods needed to address the nature and impact of specific barriers. An interactive management workshop technique was used to harness the collective intelligence of this multidisciplinary group. This method enabled participants to produce a framework and research agenda for those who are concerned about algorithmic governance. We outline this research agenda below, providing a detailed map of key research themes, questions and methods that our workshop felt ought to be pursued. This builds upon existing work on research agendas for critical algorithm studies in a unique way through the method of collective intelligence. © The Author(s) 2017.",algocracy; Algorithmic governance; Big Data; collective intelligence; interactive management; public participation,,,,,,Irish Research Council: New Horizons,,,"Alberts, H., (1992) Acquisition: Past, Present and Future.

There has been less focus on the forms of epistemology proper to the investigation of algorithms themselves, understood as scientific objects in their own right. This article, based upon 12 months of ethnographic fieldwork with Russian data scientists, addresses this lack through an investigation of the specific forms of epistemic attention paid to algorithms by data scientists. On the one hand, algorithms are unlike other mathematical objects in that they are not subject to disputation through deductive proof. On the other hand, unlike concrete things in the world such as particles or organisms, algorithms cannot be installed as the objects of experimental systems directly. They can only be evaluated in their functioning as components of extended computational assemblages; on their own, they are inert. As a consequence, the epistemological coding proper to this evaluation does not turn on truth and falsehood but rather on the efficiency of a given algorithmic assemblage. This article suggests that understanding the forms of algorithmic rationality employed in such inquiry is crucial for charting the place of data science within the contemporary academy and knowledge economy more generally. © The Author(s) 2017.",algorithms; anthropology; data science; Epistemology; rationality; Russia,,,,,,,"I would like to thank my informants for their willingness to share and explain their world.

I report from an ethnography of infrastructure in Wikipedia to discuss an often understudied aspect of this topic: the local, contextual, learned expertise involved in participating in a highly automated social–technical environment. Today, the organizational culture of Wikipedia is deeply intertwined with various data-driven algorithmic systems, which Wikipedians rely on to help manage and govern the “anyone can edit” encyclopedia at a massive scale. These bots, scripts, tools, plugins, and dashboards make Wikipedia more efficient for those who know how to work with them, but like all organizational culture, newcomers must learn them if they want to fully participate. I illustrate how cultural and organizational expertise is enacted around algorithmic agents by discussing two autoethnographic vignettes, which relate my personal experience as a veteran in Wikipedia. I present thick descriptions of how governance and gatekeeping practices are articulated through and in alignment with these automated infrastructures. Over the past 15 years, Wikipedian veterans and administrators have made specific decisions to support administrative and editorial workflows with automation in particular ways and not others. I use these cases of Wikipedia’s bot-supported bureaucracy to discuss several issues in the fields of critical algorithms studies; critical data studies; and fairness, accountability, and transparency in machine learning—most principally arguing that scholarship and practice must go beyond trying to “open up the black box” of such systems and also examine sociocultural processes like newcomer socialization. © The Author(s) 2017.",automation; bots; ethnography; online communities; Organizational culture; peer production,,,,,,,"I would like to thank many people for their advice, feedback, and support on many iterations of this article and this research, including: Aaron Halfaker, Anna Lauren Hoffmann, Charlotte Cabasse-Mazel, Coye Cheshire, Deirdre Mulligan, Elizabeth Dubois, Gina Neff, Guilherme Sanches de Oliveira, Heather Ford, Jason Oakes, Jenna Burrell, Morgan Ames, Nick Seaver, Paul Duguid, Phil Howard, Rachel Bergman, Robyn Caplan, Sam Shorey, Sam Woolley, Tarleton Gillespie, the anonymous peer reviewers, and many Wikipedians and Wikimedia Foundation staff.",,"Arnoldi, J., Computer algorithms, market manipulation and the institutionalization of high frequency trading (2016) Theory, Culture and Society, 33 (1), pp. 29-52; Austin, J.L., (1976) How to Do Things with Words, , Oxford, Oxford University Press; Boyd, D., Crawford, K., Critical questions for big data (2012) Information, Communication and Society, 15 (5), pp. 662-679; Bryant Susan, L., (2005) Becoming Wikipedian: Transformation of Participation in a Collaborative Online Encyclopedia, pp. 1-10. , http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1099205, Sanibel Island, FL: ACM; Bucher, T., The algorithmic imaginary: Exploring the ordinary affects of Facebook algorithms (2016) Information, Communication and Society, 20 (1), pp. 30-44; Burrell, J., How the machine ‘thinks’: understanding opacity in machine learning algorithms (2016) Big Data and Society, 3 (1), pp. 1-12; Crawford, K., Gillespie, T., What is a flag for?

While not a substitute for classical studies based on primary data collection, analyses of linked administrative data can answer questions that require large sample sizes or detailed data on hard-to-reach populations, and generate evidence with a high level of external validity and applicability for policy making. There are unique challenges in the appropriate research use of linked administrative data, for example with respect to bias from linkage errors where records cannot be linked or are linked together incorrectly. For confidentiality and other reasons, the separation of data linkage processes and analysis of linked data is generally regarded as best practice. However, the ‘black box’ of data linkage can make it difficult for researchers to judge the reliability of the resulting linked data for their required purposes. This article aims to provide an overview of challenges in linking administrative data for research. We aim to increase understanding of the implications of (i) the data linkage environment and privacy preservation; (ii) the linkage process itself (including data preparation, and deterministic and probabilistic linkage methods) and (iii) linkage quality and potential bias in linked data. We draw on examples from a number of countries to illustrate a range of approaches for data linkage in different contexts. © The Author(s) 2017.",administrative data; data accuracy; Data linkage; epidemiological studies; measurement error; record linkage; selection bias,,,,,,,,,"Abbott, O., Jones, P., Ralphs, M., Large-scale linkage for total populations in official statistics (2015) Methodological Developments in Data Linkage, , Harron K., Dibben C., Goldstein H., (eds), Chapter 8.

In high-level visions of open data, researchers’ data and metadata practices are expected to be robust and structured. The integration of the internet into scientific institutions amplifies these expectations. When examined critically, however, the data and metadata practices of scholarly researchers often appear incomplete or deficient. The concepts of “accountability” and “transparency” provide insight in understanding these perceived gaps. Researchers’ primary accountabilities are related to meeting the expectations of research competency, not to external standards of data deposition or metadata creation. Likewise, making data open in a transparent way can involve a significant investment of time and resources with no obvious benefits. This paper uses differing notions of accountability and transparency to conceptualize “open data” as the result of ongoing achievements, not one-time acts. © The Author(s) 2017.",accountability; data; data policy; metadata; Open data; transparency,,,,,,,The author thanks Karen Baker and Mary Marlino for comments on previous drafts.,,"Agre, P.E., Real-time politics: The internet and the political process (2002) The Information Society, 18 (5), pp. 311-331. , http://; Baker, K.S., Duerr, R.E., Parsons, M.A., Scientific knowledge mobilization: Co-evolution of data products and designated communities (2015) International Journal of Digital Curation, 10 (2), pp. 110-135. , http://; Ball, C., What is transparency?

Veillance (Sur- and Sous-veillance) is a core concept not just in human–human interaction (e.g. people watching other people) but also in terms of Human–Computer Interaction. In this sense, veillance is the core of Human-in-the-loop Intelligence (Humanistic Intelligence rather than Artificial Intelligence), leading us to the concept of “Sousveillant Systems” which are forms of Human–Computer Interaction in which internal computational states are made visible to end users, allowing users (but not requiring them) to “jump” into the computational feedback loop whenever or wherever they want. An important special case of Sousveillant Systems is that of scientific exploration: not only is (big/little) data considered, but also due consideration must be given to how data is captured, understood, explored, and discovered, and in particular, to the use of scientific instruments to collect data and to make important new discoveries, and learn about the world. Science is a domain where bottom-up transparency is of the utmost importance, and scientists have the right and responsibility to be able to understand the instruments that they use to make their discoveries. Such instruments must be sousveillant systems! © The Author(s) 2017.",artificial intelligence; Big Data; humanistic intelligence; little data; metaveillance; privacy; priveillance; security; sousveillance; sousveillance cultures; sousveillant assemblage; suicurity; surveillance; Transparency; veillance,,,,,,,,,"Ali, M.A., Ai, T., Gill, A., Comparametric HDR (High Dynamic Range) imaging for digital eye glass, wearable cameras, and sousveillance (2013) ISTAS, IEEE, 27–29 June, 2013, pp. 107-114. , (a); Ali, M.A., Nachumow, J.P., Srigley, J.A., Measuring the effect of sousveillance in increasing socially desirable behaviour (2013) ISTAS, IEEE, pp. 266-267. , (b), 27–29 June 2013; Ali, M.A., Mann, S., The inevitability of the transition from a surveillance-society to a veillance-society: Moral and economic grounding for sousveillance (2013) ISTAS, IEEE, pp. 243-254; Bakir, V., Tele-technologies, control, and sousveillance: Saddam husseinde-deification and the beast (2009) Popular Communication, 7 (1), pp. 7-16; Bakir, V., (2010) Sousveillance, Media and Strategic Political Communication: Iraq, USA, UK, , London, UK: Continuum International Publishing Group; Burrell, J., How the machine ’thinks’: Understanding opacity in machine learning algorithms (2016) Big Data & Society, 3 (1). , 2053951715622512; Callon, M., Actor-network theory the market test (1999) The Sociological Review, 47 (S1), pp. 181-195; Cardullo, P., Sniffing the city: Issues of sousveillance in inner city London (2014) Visual Studies, 29 (3), pp. 285-293; Cardwell, D., At Newark airport, the lights are on, and they’re watching you (2014) New York Times; Clynes, M., Kline, N., Cyborgs and space (1960) Astronautics, 14 (9), pp. 26-75; Cosens, C., A balance-detector for alternating-current bridges (1934) Proceedings of the Physical Society, 46 (6), p. 818; David Fraser, P., Cameras can stay in talisman’s locker room, says commissioner (2007) CBC News, , 22 March; Doherty, A., Williamson, W., Hillsdon, M., Influencing health-related behaviour with wearable cameras: Strategies & ethical considerations (2013) Proceedings of the 4Th International Sense Cam & Pervasive Imaging Conference, ACM, 2013, pp. 60-67. , (a), 18–19 November; Doherty, A.R., Hodges, S.E., King, A.C., Wearable cameras in health (2013) American Journal of Preventive Medicine, 44 (3), pp. 320-323. , b; Edwardson, L., Westside recreation centre under fire for use of surveillance cameras in mens change room (2016) Calgary metro, , 3 October; Fernback, J., Sousveillance: Communities of resistance to the surveillance environment (2013) Telematics and Informatics, 30 (1), pp. 11-21; Fletcher, G., Griffiths, M., Kutar, M., A day in the digital life: A preliminary sousveillance study (2011) SSRN, , http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1923629; Frakes, N., Calgary REC centre reassures members after security breach (2016) CBC News, , 4 October; Ganascia, J.G., The generalized sousveillance society (2010) Social Science Information, 49 (3), pp. 489-507; Gurrin, C., Smeaton, A.F., Doherty, A.R., Lifelogging: Personal big data (2014) Foundations and Trends in Information Retrieval, 8 (1), pp. 1-125; Haggerty, K.D., Ericson, R.V., The surveillant assemblage (2000) The British Journal of Sociology, 51 (4), pp. 605-622; CCD camera element used as actuation detector for electric plumbing products (2005) Canadian Patent 2602560; US and International patent application, 11 (105), p. 900. , Iott J and Nelson A; Latour, B., (2005) Reassembling the Social: An Introduction to Actor-network-theory, , Oxford University Press; Lynn Kaarst-Brown, M., Robey, D., More on myth, magic and metaphor: Cultural insights into the management of information technology in organizations (1999) Information Technology & People, 12 (2), pp. 192-218; Lyon, D., (2007) Surveillance Studies An Overview, , Polity Press; Manders, C., Moving surveillance techniques to sousveillance: Towards equiveillance using wearable computing (2013) ISTAS, p. 19. , IEEE, 27–29 June 2013; Mann, S., Wavelets and chirplets: Time–frequency perspectives, with applications (1992) Advances in Machine Vision, Strategies and Applications, , Archibald P., (ed), world scientific series computer science. 32.

While computational techniques are emerging to address aspects of these concerns through communities such as discrimination-aware data mining (DADM) and fairness, accountability and transparency machine learning (FATML), their practical implementation faces real-world challenges. For legal, institutional or commercial reasons, organisations might not hold the data on sensitive attributes such as gender, ethnicity, sexuality or disability needed to diagnose and mitigate emergent indirect discrimination-by-proxy, such as redlining. Such organisations might also lack the knowledge and capacity to identify and manage fairness issues that are emergent properties of complex sociotechnical systems. This paper presents and discusses three potential approaches to deal with such knowledge and information deficits in the context of fairer machine learning. Trusted third parties could selectively store data necessary for performing discrimination discovery and incorporating fairness constraints into model-building in a privacy-preserving manner. Collaborative online platforms would allow diverse organisations to record, share and access contextual and experiential knowledge to promote fairness in machine learning systems. Finally, unsupervised learning and pedagogically interpretable algorithms might allow fairness hypotheses to be built for further selective testing and exploration. Real-world fairness challenges in machine learning are not abstract, constrained optimisation problems, but are institutionally and contextually grounded. Computational fairness tools are useful, but must be researched and developed in and with the messy contexts that will shape their deployment, rather than just for imagined situations. Not doing so risks real, near-term algorithmic harm. © The Author(s) 2017.",Algorithmic accountability; algorithms; discrimination; machine learning; personal data; privacy,,,,,,"Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, EPSRC: EP/J017728/2

These promises hinge on “data intermediaries”: extra-institutional actors that obtain, use, and translate data for the public. However, we know little about why these individuals might regard open data as a site of civic participation. In response, we draw on Ilana Gershon to conceptualize culturally situated and socially constructed perspectives on data, or “data ideologies.” This study employs mixed methodologies to examine why members of the public hold particular data ideologies and how they vary. In late 2015 the authors engaged the public through a commission in a diverse city of approximately 500,000. Qualitative data was collected from three public focus groups with residents. Simultaneously, we obtained quantitative data from surveys. Participants’ data ideologies varied based on how they perceived data to be useful for collaboration, tasks, and translations. Bucking the “geek” stereotype, only a minority of those surveyed (20%) were professional software developers or engineers. Although only a nascent movement, we argue open data intermediaries have important roles to play in a new political landscape. © The Author(s) 2017.",Community; data intermediaries; data workers; local government; open data; politics,,,,,,,,,"Andrejevic, M., The Big Data divide (2014) International Journal of Communication, 8, pp. 1673-1689; Ansell, C.K., (2011) Pragmatist Democracy: Evolutionary Learning as Public Philosophy, , Oxford, UK, Oxford University Press; Baack, S., Datafication and empowerment: How the open data movement re-articulates notions of democracy, participation, and journalism (2015) Big Data & Society, 2, pp. 1-11; Becker, H.S., (2007) Telling about Society, , Chicago, IL, Univeristy of Chicago Press; Bennett, W.L., Segerberg, A., The logic of connective action (2012) Information, Communication & Society, 15 (5), pp. 739-768; Berg, B.L., (2004) Qualitative Research Methods for the Social Sciences, , 5th ed, Edinburgh Gate, UK: Allyn & Bacon / Pearson; Bolter, J.D., Grusin, R., (2000) Remediation : Understanding New Media, , Cambridge, The MIT Press; Brayne, S., Surveillance and system avoidance: Criminal justice contact and institutional attachment (2014) American Sociological Review, 79, pp. 367-391; Charmaz, K., Grounded Theory in the 21st century (2005) The SAGE handbook of qualitative research, , Thousand Oaks, CA, Sage Publications; Coleman, G., (2012) Coding Freedom: The Ethics and Aesthetics of Hacking, , Princeton, NJ, Princeton University Press; Couldry, N., Powell, A., Big Data from the bottom up (2014) Big Data & Society, 1; Davies, T., Open data policies and practice: An international comparison (2014) 8Th European Consortium for Political Research Conference, pp. 1-5. , Glasgow, Scotland, 3–6 September 2014; Dewey, J., (1927) The Public and Its Problems, , Athens, Swallow Press; Dimock, M., Doherty, C., Tyson, A., (2013) State Governments Viewed Favorably as Federal Rating Hits New Low, , Washington, DC, Pew Research Center; Dumpawar, S., Open government data intermediaries: Mediating data to drive changes in the built environment (2015) Comparative Media Studies.

Yet, to date, most of the debate has focused on the instruments themselves, rather than on how they are used. This article addresses this lack by examining the actual practices surrounding algorithmic technologies. Specifically, drawing on multi-sited ethnographic data, I compare how algorithms are used and interpreted in two institutional contexts with markedly different characteristics: web journalism and criminal justice. I find that there are surprising similarities in how web journalists and legal professionals use algorithms in their work. In both cases, I document a gap between the intended and actual effects of algorithms—a process I analyze as “decoupling.” Second, I identify a gamut of buffering strategies used by both web journalists and legal professionals to minimize the impact of algorithms in their daily work. Those include foot-dragging, gaming, and open critique. Of course, these similarities do not exhaust the differences between the two cases, which are explored in the discussion section. I conclude with a call for further ethnographic work on algorithms in practice as an important empirical check against the dominant rhetoric of algorithmic power. © The Author(s) 2017.",Algorithms; criminal justice; ethnography; journalism; organizations; work practices,,,,,,,"The author would like to thank Morgan Ames, danah boyd, Alex Rosenblat, Anne Washington, the three anonymous reviewers, as well as the participants of the ?Algorithms in Culture? conference (UC Berkeley, December 2016), the ?Work, Labor, and Automation?

As an interdisciplinary laboratory associating social scientists, code developers and information designers, the médialab is not one of a kind. In the last years, several of such initiatives have been established around the world to harness the potential of digital technologies for the study of collective life. If we narrate this particular story, it is because, having lived it from the inside, we can provide an intimate account of the surprises and displacements of digital research. Founding the médialab in 2009, we knew that we were leaving the reassuring traditions of social sciences to venture in the unexplored territory of digital inscriptions. What we couldn't foresee was how much such encounter would change our research. Buying into gospel of Big Data, we imagined that the main novelty of digital research came from handling larger amounts of data. We soon realized that the interest of digital inscriptions comes instead from their proliferating diversity. Such diversity encouraged us to reshape our professional alliances, research practices and theoretical perspectives. It also led us to overcome several of the oppositions that used to characterize social sciences (qualitative/quantitative, situation/aggregation, micro/macro, local/global) and to move in the direction of a more continuous sociology. © The Author(s) 2017.",Actor-network theory; computational social sciences; datascape navigation; digital methods; digital sociology; quali-quantitative methods,,,,,,,,,"Special Issue on Agent-Based Modeling (2005) American Journal of Sociology, 110 (4); Aykut, S.C., Dahan, A., (2015) Gouverner Le Climat?, , Paris, Presses de Sciences Po; Bachelard, G., (1949) Le rationalisme Appliqué, , Paris, PUF; Behrens, J.T., Chong-Ho, Y., Exploratory data analysis (2003) Handbook of Psychology, pp. 33-64. , Weiner I.B., (ed), London, Wiley, In:, (ed; Bertin, J., (1967) Sémiologie Graphique, , Paris, La Haye, Mouton; Borra, E., Weltevrede, E., Ciuccarelli, P., Contropedia – the analysis and visualization of controversies in Wikipedia articles (2014) Opensym 2014 Proceedings.; Boyd, D., Crawford, K., Six provocations for big data (2011) A Decade in Internet Time: Symposium on the Dynamics of the Internet and Society, , https://ssrn.com/abstract=1926431, accessed September 2011; Bollier, D., Firestone, C.M., (2010) The Promise and Peril of Big Data, , Washington, The Aspen Institute; Boltanski, L., L'espace positionnel: multiplicité des positions institutionnelles et habitus de classe (1973) Revue Française de Sociologie, 14 (1), pp. 3-26; Boullier, D., Pour des sciences sociales de troisième génération: des traces numériques aux répliques (2015) Big Data, Entreprises et Sciences Sociales, , Menger P.M., (ed), Paris, Open Editions Press (Collège de France), In:, (ed; Bowker, G.C., Baker, K., Millerand, F., Toward information infrastructure studies: Ways of knowing in a networked environment (2009) International Handbook of Internet Research, pp. 97-117. , http://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4020-9789-8_5, Hunsinger J., Klastrup L., Allen M.M., (eds), Dordrecht, Springer, In:, (eds; Durkheim, E., (1897) Le Suicide, , Paris, Presses Universitaires de France; Durkheim, E., (1912) Le Formes Elémentaires de la vie Religieuse, , Paris, Presses Universitaires de France; Cardon, D., Travail et travailleurs de la donnée (2013) Internet Actu, , http://www.internetactu.net/2013/12/13/travail-et-travailleurs-de-la-donnee/, (accessed 5 July 2017); Castellano, C., Fortunato, S., Loreto, V., Statistical physics of social dynamics (2009) Reviews of Modern Physics, 81, pp. 591-646; Choi, H., Varian, H.R., Predicting the present with Google trends (2009) Papers.ssrn.com, 15 (8), pp. 1327-1328; Edwards, P.N., (2010) A Vast Machine: Computer Models, Climate Data, and the Politics of Global Warming, , Cambridge MA: The MIT Press; Garnier, S., Gautrais, J., Theraulaz, G., The biological principles of swarm intelligence (2007) Swarm Intelligence, 1 (1), pp. 3-31; Heer, J., Shneiderman, B., Interactive dynamics for visual analysis (2012) Queue - Micoprocessors, 10 (2), pp. 30-55; Ince, D.C., Hatton, L., Graham-Cumming, J., The case for open computer programs (2012) Nature, 482, pp. 485-488; Johnson, R.B., Onwuegbuzie, A.J., Mixed methods research: A research paradigm whose time has come (2004) Educational Researcher, 33 (14), pp. 14-26. , http://doi.org/10.3102/0013189X033007014; Latour, B., Woolgar, S., (1979) Laboratory Life. the Construction of Scientific Facts, , Los Angeles, Sage; Latour, B., Give me a laboratory and I will raise the world (1983) Science Observed.

The CSIA is a publicly accessible Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) system that was constructed using information gathered from technical manuals, research reports, academic papers, leaked documents, and Freedom of Information Act files. Using a visceral heuristic, the CSIA demonstrates how the statistical correlations made by automated classification systems are different from human judgment and can produce false-positives, as well as how the display of information through an interface can affect the judgment of an intelligence agent. The public has the right to ask questions about how a computer program determines if they are a threat to national security and to question the practicality of using statistical pattern recognition algorithms in place of human judgment. Currently, the public’s lack of access to both Big Data and the actual datasets intelligence agencies use to train their classification algorithms keeps the possibility of performing effective sous-dataveillance out of reach. Without this data, the results returned by the CSIA will not be identical to those of intelligence agencies. Because we have replicated how OSINT is processed, however, our results will resemble the type of results and mistakes made by OSINT systems. The CSIA takes some initial steps toward contributing to an informed public debate about large-scale monitoring of open source, social media data and provides a prototype for counterveillance and sousveillance tools for citizens. © The Author(s) 2017.",counterveillance; Dataveillance; information access; social media; sousveillance; transparency,,,,,,,The CSIA was made possible by the generous support of the Science Gallery Dublin.,,"Arnold, S.E., (2015) CyberOSINT: Next-generation Information Access, Law Enforcement, Security and Intelligence Edition, , Louisville, KY, Arnold Information Technology; Bakir, V., ‘'Veillant panoptic assemblage'': Mutual watching and resistance to mass surveillance after Snowden (2015) Media and Communication, 3 (3), pp. 12-25. , http://www.cogitatiopress.com/ojs/index.php/mediaandcommunication/article/view/277, (accessed 3 February 2017; Bollier, D., The Promise and Peril of Big Data (2010) Report for the Communications and Society Program, , Washington, DC: The Aspen Institute; Boyd, D., Crawford, K., A decade in internet time (2011) Symposium on the Dynamics of the Internet and Society, , http://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.1926431, Oxford Internet Institute, UK, 21 September, accessed 3 February 2017; Compton, A., British tourists detained, deported for tweeting ‘destroy America’ (2012) Huffington Post, , http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/01/30/british-tourists-deported-for-tweeting_n_1242073.html, 30 January, accessed 23 October 2016; Cooper, J.R., (2005) Curing Analytic Pathologies: Pathways to Improved Intelligence Analysis, , Washington, DC, Center for the Study of Intelligence; Gitelman, L., Jackson, V., Introduction (2013) Raw Data” is an Oxymoron, pp. 1-14. , Gitelman L., (ed), Cambridge, MA, MIT Press, In:, (ed; (2012) IBM I2 Analyst’s Notebook Social Network Analysis.

Despite their wide adoption and economic importance, mobile dating apps have received little scholarly attention from this perspective – but they are intense sites of data generation, algorithmic processing, and cross-platform data-sharing; bound up with competing cultures of production, exploitation and use. In this paper, we describe the ways various forms of data are incorporated into, and emerge from, hook-up apps’ business logics, socio-technical arrangements, and cultures of use to produce multiple and intersecting data cultures. We propose a multi-layered research agenda for critical and empirical inquiry into this field, and suggest appropriate conceptual and methodological frameworks for exploring the social and political challenges of data cultures. © The Author(s) 2017.",apps; data culture; geo-location; mobile media; Online dating; sexuality,,,,,,,,,"Albury, K., Byron, P., Queering sexting and sexualisation (2014) Media International Australia, 153, pp. 138-147; Albury, K., Byron, P., Safe on my phone?

In introducing the theoretical and empirical research papers, artistic, activist and educational provocations and commentaries in this Special Theme, it highlights three central debates. Firstly, concerning theory/practice, it queries how useful theories of veillance and transparency are in explaining mutual watching in the post-Snowden, Big Data era. Secondly, it presents a range of questions concerning norms, ethics, regulation, resistance and social change around veillance and transparency.

Under Article 8 of the Charter, for the first time, a stand-alone fundamental right to data protection was declared. The creation of this right, standing as a distinct right to the right to privacy, is undoubtedly significant, and it is unique to the European legal order, being absent from other international human rights instruments. This commentary examines the parameters of this new right to data protection, asking what are the principles underpinning the right. It argues that the right reflects some key values inherent in the European legal order, namely: privacy, transparency, autonomy and nondiscrimination. It also analyses some of the challenges in implementing this right in an era of ubiquitous veillance practices and Big Data. © The Author(s) 2017.",Big Data; Global Data Protection Regulation; human rights; privacy; transparency; veillance,,,,,,,The author would like to thank the symposium editors for their comments on an earlier draft.,,"(2009) The Future of Privacy: Joint Contribution to the Consultation of the European Commission on the Legal Framework for the Fundamental Right to Protection of Personal Data, , http://ec.europa.eu/justice/policies/privacy/docs/wpdocs/2009/wp168_en.pdf, Available at:, accessed 9 November 2016); (2016) Opinion 01/2016 on the EU – U.S. Privacy Shield Draft Adequacy Decision, , http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/article-29/documentation/opinion-recommendation/files/2016/wp238_en.pdf, accessed 9 November 2016; Bakir, V., Veillant panoptic assemblage”: Mutual watching and resistance to mass surveillance after Snowden (2015) Media and Communication, 3 (3), pp. 12-25; Boyd, D., Crawford, K., Critical questions for big data: Provocations for a cultural, technological, and scholarly phenomenon (2012) Information, Communication & Society, 15 (5), pp. 662-679; Cannataci, J.A., Mifsud-Bonnici, J.P., Data protection comes of age: The data protection clauses in the European Constitutional Treaty (2005) Information & Communications Technology Law, 14 (1), pp. 5-15; Carlson, R.J., Nietzsche’s Snowden: Tightrope walking the posthuman dispositif (2016) Critical Posthumanism and Planetary Futures, pp. 49-74. , New Delhi, India, Springer; Carter, J., (2016) Why Couldn't Tech Predict the US Election Results?, , http://www.techradar.com/news/why-couldnt-tech-predict-the-us-election-results, accessed 12 November 2016; Clarke, R., Information technology and dataveillance (1988) Communications of the ACM, 31 (5), pp. 498-512; de Andrade, N., Oblivion: The right to be different … from oneself.

We place the emergence and transformation of professional practices such as ‘data science’, ‘data journalism’, ‘data brokerage’, ‘data mining’, ‘data storage’, and ‘data analysis’ as part of the reconfiguration of a series of fields of power and knowledge in the public and private accumulation of data. Data politics asks questions about the ways in which data has become such an object of power and explores how to critically intervene in its deployment as an object of knowledge. It is concerned with the conditions of possibility of data that involve things (infrastructures of servers, devices, and cables), language (code, programming, and algorithms), and people (scientists, entrepreneurs, engineers, information technologists, designers) that together create new worlds. We define ‘data politics’ as both the articulation of political questions about these worlds and the ways in which they provoke subjects to govern themselves and others by making rights claims. We contend that without understanding these conditions of possibility – of worlds, subjects and rights – it would be difficult to intervene in or shape data politics if by that it is meant the transformation of data subjects into data citizens. © The Author(s) 2017.",citizens; fields; Politics; power; professions; rights,,,,,,,,,"Anderson, M., Fienberg, S.E., Race and ethnicity and the controversy over the US census (2000) Current Sociology, 48 (3), pp. 87-110; Bigo, D., Pierre Bourdieu and international relations: Power of practices, practices of power (2011) International Political Sociology, 5 (3), pp. 225-258; Bigo, D., The transnational field of computerised exchange of information in police matters and its European guilds (2013) Transnational Power Elites: The Social and Global Structuration of the EU, pp. 155-182. , Kaui N., Madsen M.R., (eds), London, Routledge, In:, (eds; Bourdieu, P., Social space and symbolic power (1988) Sociological Theory, 7 (1), pp. 14-25; Bourdieu, P., (1993) Language and Symbolic Power, , Cambridge, MA, Harvard University Press; Bourdieu, P., Wacquant, L., (2006) Reflexive Anthropologie, , Frankfurt am Main, Suhrkamp; Butler, J., (1997) Excitable Speech: A Politics of the Performative, , London, Routledge; Desrosières, A., (1998) The Politics of Large Numbers: A History of Statistical Reasoning, , Camille Naish.

It is also, however, potentially troubling when Big Data (particularly derived from social media) is applied uncritically to urban governance via the ideas and practices of “smart cities”. This essay reviews both the historical depth of central ideas within smart city governance —particular the idea that enough data/information/knowledge can solve society problems—but also the ways that the most recent version differs. Namely, that the motivations and ideological underpinning behind the goal of urban betterment is largely driven by technology advocates and neoliberalism rather than the strong social justice themes associated with earlier applications of data to cities. Geosocial media data and metrics derived from them can provide useful insight and policy direction. But one must be ever mindful that metrics don’t simply measure; in the process of deciding what is important and possible to measure, these data are simultaneously defining what cities are. © The Author(s) 2017.",city planning; metrics; performativity; Smart cities; social media; urban geography,,,,,,,,,"Ajana, B., (2013) Governing through Biometrics: The Biopolitics of Identity, , Basingstoke, Palgrave Macmillan; Albino, V., Berardi, U., Dangelico, R.M., Smart cities: Definitions, dimensions, performance, and initiatives (2015) Journal of Urban Technology, 22 (1), pp. 3-21; Amoore, L., (2013) The Politics of Possibility: Risk and Security Beyond Probability, , Durham, NC, Duke University Press; Apostol, I., Antoniadis, P., Banerjee, T., Flânerie between net and place promises and possibilities for participation in planning (2013) Journal of Planning Education and Research, 33 (1), pp. 20-33; Batty, M., The computable city (1997) International Planning Studies, 2 (2), pp. 155-173; Batty, M., Axhausen, K.W., Giannotti, F., Smart cities of the future (2012) The European Physical Journal Special Topics, 214 (1), pp. 481-518; Bensinger, B., (2014) Amazon wants to ship your package before you buy it, , http://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2014/01/17/amazon-wants-to-ship-your-package-before-you-buy-it/, (accessed 14 October 2016); Bird, D., Ling, M., Haynes, K., Flooding Facebook – The use of social media during the Queensland and Victorian floods (2012) The Australian Journal of Emergency Management, 27 (1), p. 27; Bowker, G.C., Star, S.L., (2000) Sorting Things Out: Classification and Its Consequences, , Cambridge, MA: MIT press; Breen, J., (2015) Making Lexington: The Role of Art and Creativity in Urban Placemaking, , Unpublished paper; Brenner, N., Peck, J., Theodore, N., Variegated neoliberalization: Geographies, modalities, pathways (2010) Global Networks, 10 (2), pp. 182-222; Bryan, J., (2007) Map Or Be Mapped: Land, Race, and Property in Eastern Nicaragua.

The practice of Big Data governed by an ontology of hyperindividualism is also constitutive of that ontology, naturalizing and diffusing it through practices of governance and, from there, throughout myriad dimensions of everyday life. In this paper, I explicate Big Data’s ontology of hyperindividualism by contrasting it to a coconstitutive ontology that prioritizes relationality, context, and interdependence. I then situate the ontology of hyperindividualism in its genealogical context, drawing from Patrick Joyce’s history of liberalism and John Dewey’s pragmatist account of individualism, liberalism, and social action. True to its genealogical provenance, Big Data’s ontological politics of hyperindividualism reduces governance to the management of atomistic behavior, undermines the contribution of urban complexity as a resource for governance, erodes the potential for urban democracy, and eviscerates the possibility of collective resistance. © The Author(s) 2017.",democracy; epistemology; individualism; ontology; pragmatism; Urban governance,,,,,,,"Thanks to Rachel Weber and Phil Ashton for organizing the symposium on ?The Crowd, the Cloud, and Urban Governance? at the University of Illinois-Chicago in April 2015, where an earlier version of this article was presented, and thanks to Rachel, Phil, and Matt Zook for organizing this special issue on urban governance.

There are also ethical, legal and social implications from the handling of sensitive patient information. The paper explores the concerns, expectations and implications of the National Health Service (NHS) England care.data programme: a national data sharing initiative of linked electronic health records for healthcare and other research purposes. Using Nissenbaum’s contextual integrity of privacy framework through a critical Science and Technology Studies (STS) lens, it examines the way technologies and policies are developed to promote sustainability, governance and economic growth as the de facto social values, while reducing privacy to an individualistic preference. The state, acting as a new, central data broker reappropriates public ownership rights and establishes those information flows and transmission principles that facilitate the assetisation of NHS datasets for the knowledge economy. Various actors and processes from other contexts attempt to erode the public healthcare sector and privilege new information recipients. However, such data sharing initiatives in healthcare will be resisted if we continue to focus only on the monetary and scientific values of these datasets and keep ignoring their equally important social and ethical values. © The Author(s) 2017.",assetisation; care.data; consent; contextual integrity; ethics; National Health Service (NHS),,,,,,,,,"(2006) Personal Data for Public Good: Using Health Information in Medical Research: A Report, , London, Academy of Medical Sciences; (2011) A New Pathway for the Regulation and Governance of Health Research/Academy of Medical Sciences, , London, Academy of Medical Sciences; Andrejevic, M., (2013) Infoglut: How Too Much Information Is Changing the Way We Think and Know, , New York, NY, Routledge; Appleby, J., Galea, A., Murray, M., (2014) The NHS Productivity Challenge: Experience from the Front Line, , London, King’s Fund; Baldwin, C., NHS England admits failure to explain benefits of care.Data (2014) Computerweekly, , http://www.computerweekly.com/news/2240215074/NHS-England-admits-failure-to-explain-benefits-of-caredata, (accessed 7 December 2015); Berry, J.G., Ryan, P., Gold, M.S., A randomised controlled trial to compare opt-in and opt-out parental consent for childhood vaccine safety surveillance using data linkage (2012) Journal of Medical Ethics, 38 (10), pp. 619-625; (2003) Bioscience 2015: Improving national health, increasing national wealth.

In particular I examine the concept of social media ‘prosumption’—which has predominantly been theorized from a Marxist, political economic perspective—to consider what other forms of value Big Data have, imbricated with their often speculative economic value. I take the example of social media firms in their early stages of operation to suggest that, since these firms do not necessarily generate revenue, data collected through user contributions do not always realize economic value, at least in a Marxist sense, and that, in addition to their speculative value, these data have value beyond an economic valence. Instead I argue that in addition to their function as systems for accumulation, social media and their associated data have an affective value, related closely to their economic value, and demonstrate the efficacy of social media as systems designed for the appropriation and circulation of user attention. © The Author(s) 2016.",Affect; Big Data; production; prosumption; social media; value,,,,,,,"The author would like to thank the organizers Jeremy Crampton and Agnieszka Leszczynski, participants, and attendees at the ?Spatial Big Data & Everyday Life? session at the 2015 Association of American Geographers Annual Meeting.

This paper examines the work of John Graunt (1620–1674) in the tabulation of diseases in London and the development of a life table using the “imperfect data” contained in London’s Bills of Mortality in the 1600s. London’s Bills of Mortality were Big Data for the 1600s, as they included information collected over time, the depth and accuracy of which improved gradually. The main shortcoming of the data available at the time was its nonuniform upkeep and the lack of depth of variables included at its outset. Due to these characteristics, it provides a perfect model for the examination of imperfect Big Data, as it has been analyzed, criticized, and interpreted repeatedly since the 1600s. © The Author(s) 2016.",Big Data; John Graunt; life expectancy; London’s Bills of Mortality; observations; “Imperfect” Big Data,,,,,,,,,"Anonymous, Mortality, human (1842) The Encyclopaedia Britannica, or Dictionary of Arts, Sciences, and General Literature, 15 (2), p. 513; Anonymous, The story of life insurance: Chapter 1.

Some of the core commitments of existing research ethics regulations, such as the distinction between research and practice, cannot be cleanly exported from biomedical research to data science research. Such discontinuities have led some data science practitioners and researchers to move toward rejecting ethics regulations outright. These shifts occur at the same time as a proposal for major revisions to the Common Rule—the primary regulation governing human-subjects research in the USA—is under consideration for the first time in decades. We contextualize these revisions in long-running complaints about regulation of social science research and argue data science should be understood as continuous with social sciences in this regard. The proposed regulations are more flexible and scalable to the methods of non-biomedical research, yet problematically largely exclude data science methods from human-subjects regulation, particularly uses of public datasets. The ethical frameworks for Big Data research are highly contested and in flux, and the potential harms of data science research are unpredictable. We examine several contentious cases of research harms in data science, including the 2014 Facebook emotional contagion study and the 2016 use of geographical data techniques to identify the pseudonymous artist Banksy. To address disputes about application of human-subjects research ethics in data science, critical data studies should offer a historically nuanced theory of “data subjectivity” responsive to the epistemic methods, harms and benefits of data science and commerce. © The Author(s) 2016.",Big Data; Common Rule; critical data studies; Data ethics; human subjects,,,,,,"National Science Foundation, NSF

Our existing review of current Big Data applications in the agri-food sector has revealed several collection and analytics tools that may have implications for relationships of power between players in the food system (e.g. between farmers and large corporations). For example, Who retains ownership of the data generated by applications like Monsanto Corproation's Weed I.D. “app”? Are there privacy implications with the data gathered by John Deere's precision agricultural equipment? Systematically tracing the digital revolution in agriculture, and charting the affordances as well as the limitations of Big Data applied to food and agriculture, should be a broad research goal for Big Data scholarship.

More and more often, algorithms mediate social processes, business transactions, governmental decisions, and how we perceive, understand, and interact among ourselves and with the environment. Gaps between the design and operation of algorithms and our understanding of their ethical implications can have severe consequences affecting individuals as well as groups and whole societies. This paper makes three contributions to clarify the ethical importance of algorithmic mediation. It provides a prescriptive map to organise the debate. It reviews the current discussion of ethical aspects of algorithms. And it assesses the available literature in order to identify areas requiring further work to develop the ethics of algorithms. © The Author(s) 2016.",Algorithms; automation; Big Data; data analytics; data mining; ethics; machine learning,,,,,,,,,"Adler, P., Falk, C., Friedler, S.A., (2016) Auditing Black-Box Models by Obscuring Features, , http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.07043, (accessed 5 March 2016); Agrawal, R., Srikant, R., Privacy-preserving data mining (2000) ACM Sigmod Record, pp. 439-450. , http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=335438, ACM, : (accessed 20 August 2015; Allen, C., Wallach, W., Smit, I., Why machine ethics?

These mechanisms of classification all frequently rely on computational algorithms, and in many cases on machine learning algorithms to do this work. In this article, I draw a distinction between three forms of opacity: (1) opacity as intentional corporate or state secrecy, (2) opacity as technical illiteracy, and (3) an opacity that arises from the characteristics of machine learning algorithms and the scale required to apply them usefully. The analysis in this article gets inside the algorithms themselves. I cite existing literatures in computer science, known industry practices (as they are publicly presented), and do some testing and manipulation of code as a form of lightweight code audit. I argue that recognizing the distinct forms of opacity that may be coming into play in a given application is a key to determining which of a variety of technical and non-technical solutions could help to prevent harm. © The Author(s) 2016.",classification; discrimination; inequality; machine learning; Opacity; spam filtering,,,,,,,"Thank you to the many who reviewed and provided comments in the early stages of writing this paper including Sebastian Benthall, Laura Devendorf, Shreeharsh Kelkar, Marion Fourcade, Michael Carl Tshantz, Solon Barocas, David Bamman, Steve Weber and the members of the UC-Berkeley Social Science Matrix seminar on ?algorithms as computation and culture.?",,"Barocas, S., Data mining and the discourse on discrimination (2014) Proceedings of the Data Ethics Workshop, Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (KDD), pp. 24-27. , August, New York City; Barocas, S., (2014) Panic Inducing: Data Mining, Fairness, and Privacy, , (b), PhD Thesis, New York University, USA; Barocas, S., Selbst, A., Big Data’s disparate impact California Law Review, , forthcoming; Both, G., (2014) What Drives Research in Self-Driving Cars?

It provides a commentary on the ability of sousveillance to destabilise and disrupt suer/violence by shifting its focus from the centre to the periphery, where Big Data surveillance is tantamount to sur/violence. In these peripheral political spaces, surveillance is not framed by concerns over privacy, democracy and civil society; rather, it is a matter of life and death, a technique of both biopolitical and thanatopolitical power. I argue that the universalist, and universalizing, debates over surveillance cannot be mapped through the anxieties of privileged middle classes as they would neither transcend nor make possible alternative ways of tackling the intersection of surveillance and violence so long as they are couched in the liberal concerns for democracy. I call this phenomenon “liberal luxury,” whereby debates over surveillance have over-emphasised liberal proclivities at the expense of disengaging those peripheral populations most severely affected by sur/violence. © The Author(s) 2016.",drones; Sousveillance; sur/violence; surveillance; veillance,,,,,,,,,"Boym, S., Nostalgia and its discontents (2007) Hedgehog Review, pp. 7-18; Butler, J., Legal violence: An ethical and political critique (2016) Tanner Lectures on Human Values – Interpreting Non-Violence, , Yale University, New Haven; Césaire, A., (2000) Discourse on Colonialism, , New York, Monthly Review Press; Cole, D., The drone presidency (2016) The New York Review of Books, , http://www.nybooks.com/articles/2016/08/18/the-drone-presidency/, accessed 10 October 2016; Hickman, C., Fredric Jameson – Utopia, Dystopia, and the myth of Neoliberalism (2016) Social Ecologies, , https://socialecologies.wordpress.com/2016/08/07/fredric-jameson-utopia-dystopia-and-the-myth-of-neoliberalism/, Available at:, accessed 16 August 2016; (2014) Surveillance, pp. 1-13. , Snowden, and big data, Capacities, consequences, critique.

As a pilot application of implementing the meme diffusion, we developed the social media analytics and research testbed to monitor Twitter messages and track the diffusion of information in and across different cities and geographic regions. Social media analytics and research testbed is an online geo-targeted search and analytics tool, including an automatic data processing procedure at the backend and an interactive frontend user interface. Social media analytics and research testbed is initially designed to facilitate (1) searching and geo-locating tweet topics and terms in different cities and geographic regions; (2) filtering noise from raw data (such as removing redundant retweets and using machine learning methods to improve precision); (3) analyzing social media data from a spatiotemporal perspective; and (4) visualizing social media data in diagnostic ways (such as weekly and monthly trends, trend maps, top media, top retweets, top mentions, or top hashtags). Social media analytics and research testbed provides researchers and domain experts with a tool that can efficiently facilitate the refinement, formalization, and testing of research hypotheses or questions. Three case studies (flu outbreaks, Ebola epidemic, and marijuana legalization) are introduced to illustrate how the predictions of meme diffusion can be examined and to demonstrate the potentials and key functions of social media analytics and research testbed. © The Author(s) 2016.",Big Data; data mining; human dynamics; social media; spatiotemporal analysis,,,,,,,,,"Alshamsi, A., Pianesi, F., Lepri, B., Beyond contagion: Reality mining reveals complex patterns of social influence (2015) PLoS One, 10 (8), p. e0135740; Andrienko, G., Andrienko, N., Bosch, H., Thematic patterns in georeferenced tweets through space-time visual analytics (2013) Computing in Science and Engineering, 15 (3), pp. 72-82; Aslam, A.A., Tsou, M.-H., Spitzberg, B.H., The reliability of tweets as a supplementary method of seasonal influenza surveillance (2014) Journal of Medical Internet Research, 16 (11), p. e250; Bahk, C.Y., Scales, D.A., Mekaru, S.R., Comparing timeliness, content, and disease severity of formal and informal source outbreak reporting (2015) BMC Infectious Diseases, 15, p. 135; Barboza, P., Vaillant, L., Le Strat, Y., Factors influencing performance of internet-based biosurveillance systems used in epidemic intelligence for early detection of infectious diseases outbreaks (2014) PLoS One, 9 (3), p. e90536; Brennan, R., Reflections on the Ebola outbreak: Perspectives from the frontline (2014) Journal of Communication in Healthcare, 7 (4), pp. 248-249; Brownstein, J.S., Freifeld, C.C., Reis, B.Y., Surveillance sans frontières: Internet-based emerging infectious disease intelligence and the HealthMap project (2008) PLoS Med, 5, pp. 1-6; Chae, J., Thom, D., Bosch, H., Spatiotemporal social media analytics for abnormal event detection and examination using seasonal-trend decomposition (2012) IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology 2012, VAST 2012—proceedings, pp. 143-152. , New York, NY, IEEE Computer Society Press; Cheung, C.M.K., Thadani, D.R., The impact of electronic word-of-mouth communication: A literature analysis and integrative model (2012) Decision Support Systems, 54 (1), pp. 461-470; Culotta, A., Lightweight methods to estimate influenza rates and alcohol sales volume from Twitter messages (2013) Language Resources and Evaluation, 47 (1), pp. 217-238; Diakopoulos, N., Naaman, M., Kivran-Swaine, F., Diamonds in the rough: Social media visual analytics for journalistic inquiry (2010) IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology 2010, VAST 2010–Proceedings, pp. 115-122. , New York, NY, IEEE Computer Society Press; Duggan, M., (2015) Mobile Messaging and Social Media – 2015.

Through a discussion of participatory research into air pollution sensing with residents of northeastern Pennsylvania concerned about the effects of hydraulic fracturing, we examine how new technologies for generating environmental data also give rise to new problems for analysing and making sense of citizen-gathered data. After first outlining the citizen data practices we collaboratively developed with residents for monitoring air quality, we then describe the data stories that we created along with citizens as a method and technique for composing data. We further mobilise the concept of ‘just good enough data’ to discuss the ways in which citizen data gives rise to alternative ways of creating, valuing and interpreting datasets. We specifically consider how environmental data raises different concerns and possibilities in relation to Big Data, which can be distinct from security or social media studies.

This introduction discusses how environmental Big Data is emerging as a parallel area of investigation within studies of Big Data. New practices, technologies, actors and issues are concretising that are distinct and specific to the operations of environmental data. Situating these developments in relation to the seven contributions to this special collection, the introduction outlines significant characteristics of environmental data practices, data materialisations and data contestations. In these contributions, it becomes evident that processes for validating, distributing and acting on environmental data become key sites of materialisation and contestation, where new engagements with environmental politics and citizenship are worked through and realised. © The Author(s) 2016.",data contestations; data materialisations; data practices; environmental Big Data; Environmental data; environmental monitoring,,,,,,,"Thanks are due to the contributors to the special theme, as well as the anonymous reviewers who provided helpful and constructive feedback on the articles and commentaries.",,"Asdal, K., Enacting things through numbers: Taking nature into account/ing (2008) Geoforum, 39 (1), pp. 123-132; Baker, K.S., Jackson, S.J., Wanetick, J.R., Strategies supporting heterogeneous data and interdisciplinary collaboration: Towards an ocean informatics environment (2005) Proceedings of the 38Th Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences, , http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1385686/; Batty, M., Big Data, smart cities and city planning (2013) Dialogues in Human Geography, 3 (3), pp. 274-279; Beniger, J.R., (1989) The Control Revolution: Technological and Economic Origins of the Information Society, , Cambridge, MA, Harvard University Press; Benson, E., Trackable life: Data, sequence, and organism in movement ecology (2016) Studies in History and Philosophy of Science Part C: Studies in History and Philosophy of Biological and Biomedical Sciences, 57, pp. 137-147; Boellstorff, T., Maurer, B., (2015) Data, Now Bigger and Better!, , Chicago, IL: Prickly Paradigm Press; Borgmann, C., (2015) Big Data, Little Data, No Data: Scholarship in the Networked World, , Cambridge, MIT Press; Bowker, G.C., Biodiversity data diversity (2000) Social Studies of Science, 30 (5), pp. 643-683; boyd, D., Crawford, K., Critical questions for Big Data: Provocations for a cultural, technological, and scholarly phenomenon (2012) Information, Communication & Society, 15 (5), pp. 662-679; Costa, B.D., (2006) Pigeon Blog, , http://web.archive.org/web/20120418181942/http://www.beatrizdacosta.net/pigeonblog.php, Available at:, (accessed 19 August 2016); (2016) Environmental Data Exchange, , https://www.environmentaldataexchange.org.uk/; Edwards, P.N., (2010) A Vast Machine: Computer Models, Climate Data, and the Politics of Global Warming, , Cambridge, MIT Press; Edwards, P.N., Mayernik, M.S., Batcheller, A.L., Science friction: Data, metadata, and collaboration (2011) Social Studies of Science, 41 (5), pp. 667-690; Elwood, S., Volunteered geographic information: Future research directions motivated by critical, participatory, and feminist GIS (2008) GeoJournal, 72 (3-4), pp. 173-183; Fortun, K., Biopolitics and the informating of environmentalism (2012) Lively Capital: Biotechnologies, Ethics, and Governance in Global Markets, pp. 306-326. , Sunder Rajan K, Durham, NC, Duke University Press; Fortun, M., Fortun, K., Costelloe-Kuehn, B., Pushback: Critical data designers and pollution politics (2016) Big Data & Society, 3 (2), pp. 1-14; Gabrys, J., Powering the digital: From energy ecologies to electronic environmentalism (2014) Media and the Ecological Crisis, pp. 3-18. , Maxwell R., Raundalen J., Lager Vestberg N., (eds), New York, NY and London, Routledge, In:, (eds; Gabrys, J., (2016) Program Earth: Environmental Sensing Technology and the Making of a Computational Planet, , Minneapolis, University of Minnesota Press; Gabrys, J., Pritchard, H., Barratt, B., Just good enough data: Figuring data citizenships through air pollution sensing and data stories (2016) Big Data & Society, 3 (2); Garnett, E., Developing a feeling for error: Practices of monitoring and modelling air pollution data (2016) Big Data & Society, 3 (2), pp. 1-12; Goodchild, M.F., Citizens as sensors: The world of volunteered geography (2007) GeoJournal, 69 (4), pp. 211-221; Gupta, A., Lövbrand, E., Turnhout, E., In pursuit of carbon accountability: The politics of REDD+ measuring, reporting and verification systems (2012) Current Opinion in Environmental Sustainability, 4 (6), pp. 726-731; Haklay, M., Neogeography and the delusion of democratisation (2013) Environment and Planning A, 45 (1), pp. 55-69; Hampton, E.D., Strasser, C.A., Tewksbury, J.J., Big Data and the future of ecology (2013) Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment, 11 (3), pp. 156-162; Helmreich, S., (2009) Alien Ocean: Anthropological Voyages in Microbial Seas, , Berkeley, University of California Press; Hogan, M., Data flows and water woes: The Utah Data Center (2015) Big Data & Society, 2 (2), pp. 1-12; Kitchin, R., The real-time city?

In the main, definitions suggest that Big Data possess a suite of key traits: volume, velocity and variety (the 3Vs), but also exhaustivity, resolution, indexicality, relationality, extensionality and scalability. However, these definitions lack ontological clarity, with the term acting as an amorphous, catch-all label for a wide selection of data. In this paper, we consider the question ‘what makes Big Data, Big Data?’, applying Kitchin’s taxonomy of seven Big Data traits to 26 datasets drawn from seven domains, each of which is considered in the literature to constitute Big Data. The results demonstrate that only a handful of datasets possess all seven traits, and some do not possess either volume and/or variety. Instead, there are multiple forms of Big Data. Our analysis reveals that the key definitional boundary markers are the traits of velocity and exhaustivity. We contend that Big Data as an analytical category needs to be unpacked, with the genus of Big Data further delineated and its various species identified. It is only through such ontological work that we will gain conceptual clarity about what constitutes Big Data, formulate how best to make sense of it, and identify how it might be best used to make sense of the world. © The Author(s) 2016.",Big Data; characteristics; ontology; taxonomy; types,,,,,,,,,"Batty, M., Data about cities: Redefining big, recasting small (2015) Paper Prepared for the Data and the City Workshop, , http://www.spatialcomplexity.info/files/2015/08/Data-Cities-Maynooth-Paper-BATTY.pdf, Maynooth University, 31 August–1 September 2015, (accessed 4 September 2015); Boyd, D., Crawford, K., Critical questions for big data (2012) Information, Communication and Society, 15 (5), pp. 662-679; Bucher, T., ‘Want to be on the top?’ Algorithmic power and the threat of invisibility on Facebook (2012) New Media and Society, 14 (7), pp. 1164-1180; Cahalane, C., McCarthy, T., McElhinney, C.P., MIMIC: Mobile mapping point density calculator (2012) Proceedings of the 3Rd International Conference on Computing for Geospatial Research and Applications, , 1--3 July 2012, Washington, DC, USA, ACM; Diebold, F., (2012) A personal perspective on the origin(S) and development of ‘big data’: The phenomenon, the term, and the discipline, , http://www.ssc.upenn.edu/, (accessed 5 February 2013); Dodge, M., Kitchin, R., Codes of life: Identification codes and the machine-readable world (2005) Environment and Planning D: Society and Space, 23 (6), pp. 851-881; Florescu, D., Karlberg, M., Reis, F., (2014) Will ‘big data’ Transform Official Statistics?, , http://www.q2014.at/fileadmin/user_upload/ESTAT-Q2014-BigDataOS-v1a.pdf, (accessed 1 April 2015); Kitchin, R., Big data and human geography: Opportunities, challenges and risks (2013) Dialogues in Human Geography, 3 (3), pp. 262-267; Kitchin, R., (2014) The Data Revolution: Big Data, Open Data, Data Infrastructures and Their Consequences, , London, Sage; Kitchin, R., The opportunities, challenges and risks of big data for official statistics (2015) Statistical Journal of the International Association of Official Statistics, 31 (3), pp. 471-481; Laney, D., (2001) 3D Data Management: Controlling Data Volume, Velocity and Variety, , http://blogs.gartner.com/doug-laney/files/2012/01/ad949-3D-Data-Management-Controlling-Data-Volume-Velocity-and-Variety.pdf, Meta Group, Available at:, accessed 16 January 2013; Lupton, D., The thirteen Ps of big data (2015) The Sociological Life, , https://simplysociology.wordpress.com/2015/05/11/the-thirteen-ps-of-big-data/, 13 May, Available at:, accessed 17 September 2015; Marr, B., (2014) Big data: The 5 vs everyone must know, , https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/20140306073407-64875646-big-data-the-5-vs-everyone-must-know, March 6.

Among these is the enigma of digital subjectivation. Who are the subjects of Big Data? A field where this question is particularly pressing is finance. Since the 1990s traders have been steadily integrated into computerized data assemblages, which calls for an ontology that eliminates the distinction between human sovereign subjects and non-human instrumental objects. The latter subjectivize traders in pre-conscious ways, because human consciousness runs too slow to follow the volatility of the market. In response to this conundrum Social Studies of Finance has drawn on Actor-Network Theory to interpret financial markets as technically constructed networks of human and non-human actors. I argue that in order to develop an explicitly critical data study it might be advantageous to refer to Maurizio Lazzarato’s theory of machinic subjugation instead. Although both accounts describe financial digital subjectivation similarly, Lazzarato has the advantage of coupling his description to a clear critique of and resistance to finance. © The Author(s) 2016.",financial markets; Lazzarato; resistance; semiotics; Social Studies of Finance; subjectivation,,,,,,,"I thank the researchers from the session on Biopolitics 2.0 at the Mancept Conference in Manchester in 2015 for commenting on a talk I gave based on this article.

This particular issue has not attracted much attention, despite its major impacts on the regulation of chemicals. This raises the problem of causality at the crossroads between data and regulatory sciences, particularly in the case models known as quantitative structure–activity relationship models. This paper shows that models establish correlations and not scientific facts, and it engages anew the way regulators deal with uncertainties. It does so by exploring the tension and problems raised by the possibility of causal explanation afforded by quantitative structure–activity relationship models. It argues that the specificity of predictive modelling promotes rethinking of the regulation of chemicals. © The Author(s) 2016.",causality; Predictive modelling; quantitative structure–activity relationship; risk regulation,,,,,,,,,"Atlan, H., (2011) Qu’est-ce qu’un modèle?, , Paris, Manucius; Barry, A., Pharmaceutical matters: The invention of informed materials (2005) Theory, Culture and Society, 22 (1), pp. 51-69; Bensaude-Vincent, B., Stengers, I., (1993) L’histoire de la chimie, , Paris, La Découverte; Burello, E., Profiling the biological activity of oxide nanomaterials with mechanistic models (2013) Computational Science and Discovery, 6, p. 014009; Dalton, C., Thatcher, J., What does a critical data studies look like, and why do we care?

Taking as an empirical object the heat generated from server halls, the article traces the expanding phenomenon of ‘waste heat recycling’ and charts the ways in which data centre operators in Stockholm and Paris direct waste heat through metropolitan district heating systems and urban homes, and valorise it. Drawing on new materialisms, infrastructure studies and classical theory of production and destruction of value in capitalism, the article outlines two modes in which this process happens, namely infrastructural convergence and decentralisation of the data centre. These modes arguably help data centre operators convert big data from a source of value online into a raw material that needs to flow in the network irrespective of meaning. In this conversion process, the article argues, a new commodity is in a process of formation, that of computation traffic. Altogether data-driven heat production is suggested to raise the importance of certain data processing nodes in Northern Europe, simultaneously intervening in the global politics of access, while neutralising external criticism towards big data by making urban life literally dependent on power from data streams. © The Author(s) 2016.",big data; computation traffic; data furnace; data heat recycling; server cooling; Waste heat,,,,,,,"I wish to thank the participants in the BreStoLon research network for their encouraging feedback on an earlier version of this work presented at the Stockholm network meeting earlier this year.

However, it is often overlooked as a dimension of situatedness in social studies of information. Rather, situatedness has been defined primarily as embodiment or social context. This paper explores place attachments in Big Data by adapting close and distant approaches for reading texts to examine the accessions data of the Arnold Arboretum, a living collection of trees, vines and shrubs established by Harvard University in 1872 (The original interactive data visualizations can be found online: http://www.lifeanddeathofdata.org). Although it is an early and unconventional example of the phenomenon, there are several reasons that the Arboretum is a useful site for investigating the relationship between Big Data and place. First, the category of place is embedded in a range of data fields used in the Arboretum’s records. Second, the Arboretum has long sought to be a place in which scientists and citizens alike can encounter large collections of data firsthand. Third, the place has shaped fluctuations in the daily production of data over the course of the Arboretum’s 144 year history. Furthermore, Arboretum data can help us see place in ways not necessarily tied to geolocation. Each of these place attachments suggests a different way in which data can be environmental: by being about, in, from, or generative of place. Taken together, these attachments offer a model for examining other data in relation to their environments. Moreover, the paper contends that rather than being detached from place, as prevailing discourses suggest, Big Data bring together more and further reaching place attachments than data sets of smaller sizes. © The Author(s) 2016.",close reading; distant reading; Environmental data; place; situated knowledge,,,,,,Arnold Arboretum,"This work was made possible by William (Ned) Friedman, director of the Arnold Arboretum, and by the generous participation of many Arboretum staff members.

Part of ESA’s Copernicus Programme, the sentinel mission has adopted an Open Data policy which intends to make different levels of data freely available via an online data hub. Sentinel data will support applications including land monitoring, emergency management and security and will thus form the evidence-base for a wide-range of local, regional, national and international decisions, from individual insurance claims to humanitarian interventions. By providing ever more data streams for monitoring and managing the planet, the sentinels institute a novel mode of visibility in terms of resolution, coverage and frequency. At the same time, they are co-constitutive of the increasing datafication of the environment. In the entwinement of heavenly gaze and data visions, I want to recover the work of ‘data fictions’ in order to demystify notions of visibility and calculability associated with “earth observation” and trouble its unquestioned pursuit of total monitoring. © The Author(s) 2016.",data fictions; earth observation; Environmental satellites; sentinels; vision; war,,,,,,,"Many thanks to Jennifer Gabrys, Bernd B?sel and three anonymous reviewers for valuable comments and guidance.",,"Alexievich, S., (2016) Chernobyl Prayer: A Chronicle of the Future, , Trans.

It identifies and examines a ‘shareveillant’ subjectivity: a form configured by the sharing and watching that subjects have to withstand and enact in the contemporary data assemblage. Looking at government open and closed data as case studies, this article demonstrates how ‘shareveillance’ produces an anti-political role for the public. In describing shareveillance as, after Jacques Rancière, a distribution of the (digital) sensible, this article posits a politico-ethical injunction to cut into the share and flow of data in order to arrange a more enabling assemblage of data and its affects. In order to interrupt shareveillance, this article borrows a concept from Édouard Glissant and his concern with raced otherness to imagine what a ‘right to opacity’ might mean in the digital context. To assert this right is not to endorse the individual subject in her sovereignty and solitude, but rather to imagine a collective political subjectivity and relationality according to the important question of what it means to ‘share well’ beyond the veillant expectations of the state. © The Author(s) 2016.",distribution; opacity; secrecy; Sharing; subjectivity; transparency,,,,,,,,,"Althusser, L., Ideology and ideological state apparatuses (1971) In: Lenin and Philosophy, and Other Essays, pp. 127-188. , (Trans.

Though expressed as a professional move, this article argues that the push incorporates gendered assumptions that disadvantage women. Using the human resource occupation as an example, I demonstrate how normative perceptions of feminine “soft skills” are seen as irreconcilable with the masculine “hard numbers” of a data-driven epistemology. The history of human resources reflects how assumptions of a biological fit with an occupation limit what women can convincingly describe as her skillsets. However, challenging this cannot stay within the confines of the occupation itself.

One particularly important source is administrative data, which were originally collected for organisational purposes but often contain information that is suitable for social science research. In this paper we outline the concept of reproducible research in relation to micro-level administrative social science data. Our central claim is that a planned and organised workflow is essential for high quality research using micro-level administrative social science data. We argue that it is essential for researchers to share research code, because code sharing enables the elements of reproducible research. First, it enables results to be duplicated and therefore allows the accuracy and validity of analyses to be evaluated. Second, it facilitates further tests of the robustness of the original piece of research. Drawing on insights from computer science and other disciplines that have been engaged in e-Research we discuss and advocate the use of Git repositories to provide a useable and effective solution to research code sharing and rendering social science research using micro-level administrative data reproducible. © The Author(s) 2016.",administrative data; Big Data; Git; replication; reproducibility; workflow,,,,,,University of Edinburgh,"We gratefully acknowledge the comments of Professor Philip Stark (UC Berkeley), Kellie Ottoboni (UC Berkeley), Dr Nicole Janz (University of Cambridge), Dr Alasdair Rutherford (University of Stirling), Dr Iain Atherton (Edinburgh Napier University), and Dr Kevin Ralston (University of Edinburgh).

Open the briefcase up and one finds a wood panel with a flatscreen inset, playing back the IP traffic of the archive's current users. Thus, while an audience such as a class of students or workshop group can access the Snowden documents and learn about mass surveillance from primary materials, they are also shown what data surveillance ‘looks like’. This Commentary explores my experiences during the first year of the Snowden Archive-in-a-Box. I examine my experiences as an international traveller carrying a suspicious briefcase of Top Secret materials and this project's reception by certain audiences. The project is still a prototype, yet it is quickly gathering a following and a number of permanent installations around the world.

Cogent, excellent research in a variety of fields has explored what the spatial data these devices produce can reveal of society, such as analysis of Foursquare check-ins to reveal patterns of mobility for groups through a city. In such studies, the individual intentions, motivations, and desires behind the production of said data can become lost through computational aggregation and analysis. In this commentary, I argue for a rethinking of the epistemological leap from individual to data point through a (re)seating of the reflexive, self-eliciting subject as an object for spatial big data research. To do so, I first situate current research on spatial big data within a computational turn in social sciences that relies overly on the data produced as a stand-in for the subject producing said data. Second, I argue that a recent shift within geography and cognate disciplines toward viewing spatial big data as a form of spatial media allows for study of the sociotechnical processes that produce modern assemblages of data and society. As spatial media, the spatial big data created through mobile device use can be understood as the data of everyday life and as part of the sociotechnical processes that produce individuals, data, and space. Ultimately, to understand the data of everyday life, researchers must write thick descriptions of the stories we tell ourselves about the data we give off to others. © The Author(s) 2016.",critical data studies; mobile spatial data; Spatial media; subject formation; thick description,,,,,,,,,"Anderson, C., The end of theory: the data deluge makes the scientific method obsolete (2008) Wired, 16 (7), pp. 2-6; Baginski, J., Sui, D., Malecki, E.J., Exploring the intraurban digital divide using restaurant reviews: A case study in Franklin County, Ohio (2014) The Professional Geographer, 66 (3), pp. 443-455; Berry, D.M., (2011) The Philosophy of Software: Code and Mediation in the Digital Age, , London, Palgrave Macmillan; Bertel, T.F., It’s like I trust it so much that I don’t really check where it is I’m going before I leave”: Informational uses of smartphones among Danish youth (2013) Mobile Media and Communication, 1 (3), pp. 299-313; Boellstorff, T., Making big data, in theory (2013) First Monday, 18 (10). , http://firstmonday.org/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/4869/3750, (accessed 7 July 2016); boyd, D., Crawford, K., Critical questions for big data (2012) Information, Communication and Society, 15 (5), pp. 662-679; Brake, D.R., Are we all online content creators now?

Whilst such data-driven forms of governance have significant implications for citizenship and society, resistance to surveillance in the wake of the Snowden leaks has predominantly centred on techno-legal responses relating to the development and use of encryption and policy advocacy around privacy and data protection. Based on in-depth interviews with a range of social justice activists, we argue that there is a significant level of ambiguity around this kind of anti-surveillance resistance in relation to broader activist practices, and critical responses to the Snowden leaks have been confined within particular expert communities. Introducing the notion of ‘data justice’, we therefore go on to make the case that resistance to surveillance needs to be (re)conceptualized on terms that can address the implications of this data-driven form of governance in relation to broader social justice agendas. Such an approach is needed, we suggest, in light of a shift to surveillance capitalism in which the collection, use and analysis of our data increasingly comes to shape the opportunities and possibilities available to us and the kind of society we live in. © The Author(s) 2016.",activism; data justice; Snowden; surveillance,,,,,,,,,"Andrejevic, M., (2015) Keynote Plenary at the Conference ‘Surveillance and Citizenship’, , Cardiff; Aouragh, M., Gürses, S., Rocha, J., Let's first get things done!

Concerns about data falsification, erroneous analysis, and misleading presentation of research results have recently strengthened the call for new procedures that ensure public accountability for data-driven decisions. Though we generally count ourselves in favor of increased transparency in data practice, this Commentary highlights a caveat. We suggest that legislative efforts that invoke the language of data transparency can sometimes function as “Trojan Horses” through which other political goals are pursued. Framing these maneuvers in the language of transparency can be strategic, because approaches that emphasize open access to data carry tremendous appeal, particularly in current political and technological contexts. We illustrate our argument through two examples of pro-transparency policy efforts, one historical and one current: industry-backed “sound science” initiatives in the 1990s, and contemporary legislative efforts to open environmental data to public inspection. Rules that exist mainly to impede science-based policy processes weaponize the concept of data transparency. The discussion illustrates that, much as Big Data itself requires critical assessment, the processes and principles that attend it—like transparency—also carry political valence, and, as such, warrant careful analysis. © The Author(s) 2016.",data; governance; openness; policy; science; Transparency,,,,,,,,,"Ablin, R.J., The problem with prostate screening (2014) The New York Times, , http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/26/opinion/the-problem-with-prostate-screening.html, 25 November. : (accessed 9 October 2015; Alberts, B., Cicerone, R.J., Fienberg, S.E., Self-correction in science at work (2015) Science, 348 (6242), pp. 1420-1422; (2014), http://democrats.science.house.gov/sites/democrats.science.house.gov/files/documents/Coalition-secret_science:house.pdf, American Association for the Advancement of Science, Letter to house majority whip Kevin McCarthy, 31 July, accessed 9 October 2015; Baba, A., Cook, D.M., McGarity, T.O., Legislating ‘sound science': The role of the tobacco industry (2005) American Journal of Public Health, 95 (S1), pp. S20-S27; Carey, B., Belluck, P., Doubts about study of gay canvassers rattle the field (2015) The New York Times, , http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/26/science/maligned-study-on-gay-marriage-is-shaking-trust.html, 25 May. : (accessed 9 October 2015; Chang, A.C., Li, P., (2015) Is economics research replicable?

This data is also highly promissory. But as this paper argues, such data fails both consumers and citizens. The governance of climate change seemingly requires a strong foundation of data on emission sources. Economists approach climate change as a market failure, where the optimisation of the atmosphere is to be evidence based and data driven. Citizens or consumers, state or private agents of control, all require deep access to information to judge emission realities. Whether we are interested in state-led or in neoliberal ‘solutions’ for either democratic participatory decision-making or for preventing market failure, companies’ emissions need to be known. This paper draws on 20 months of ethnographic fieldwork in a Fortune 50 company’s environmental accounting unit to show how carbon reporting interferes with information symmetry requirements, which further troubles possibilities for contesting data. A material-semiotic analysis of the data practices and infrastructures employed in the context of corporate emissions disclosure details the situated political economies of data labour along the data processing chain. The explicit consideration of how information asymmetries are socially and computationally shaped, how contexts are shifted and how data is systematically straightened out informs a reflexive engagement with Big Data. The paper argues that attempts to automatise environmental accounting’s veracity management by means of computing metadata or to ensure that data quality meets requirements through third-party control are not satisfactory. The crossover of Big Data with corporate environmental governance does not promise to trouble the political economy that hitherto sustained unsustainability. © The Author(s) 2016.",data practice; data quality; environmental accounting; Environmental governance; environmental information; veracity management,,,,,,,"First, I am deeply grateful to Lydia Stiebitz for substituting my parenting work, which enabled me to work on this analysis.

Drawing on ethnographic observations and interviews, we analyse how critical data designers turn scientific data and findings into claims and visualisations that are meaningful in contemporary political terms. The skills of critical data designers cross scales and domains; they must identify problems calling for public consideration, and then locate, access, link, and create visualisations of data relevant to the problem. We conclude by describing hazards ahead in work to leverage Big Data to understand and address environmental problems. Critical data designers need to understand what counts as a societal problem in a particular context, what doesn’t, what is seen as connected and not, what is seen as ethically charged, and what is exonerated and discounted.

In this paper, we describe how critical data designers have created projects that ‘push back’ against the eclipse of environmental problems by dominant orders: the pioneering pollution database Scorecard, released by the US NGO Environmental Defense Fund in 1997; the US Environmental Protection Agency’s EnviroAtlas that brings together numerous data sets and provides tools for valuing ecosystem services; and the Houston Clean Air Network’s maps of real-time ozone levels in Houston. Drawing on ethnographic observations and interviews, we analyse how critical data designers turn scientific data and findings into claims and visualisations that are meaningful in contemporary political terms. The skills of critical data designers cross scales and domains; they must identify problems calling for public consideration, and then locate, access, link, and create visualisations of data relevant to the problem. We conclude by describing hazards ahead in work to leverage Big Data to understand and address environmental problems. Critical data designers need to understand what counts as a societal problem in a particular context, what doesn’t, what is seen as connected and not, what is seen as ethically charged, and what is exonerated and discounted. Such recognition is produced through interpretive, ‘close reading’ of the historical moment in which they operate.

Like painting, artists are creating new visuals and representations with data. Like sculpture, artists are recombining bits to build something new out of the commonplace. Like photography, artists are using data to mirror or reflect contemporary society. In my own practice for the last 15 years I have been using data (both sourced and generated) to make works at the intersection of art, design and activism with a recent focus on environmental topics. It is my belief that through improved representation of, access to and public involvement with data we can increase understanding of important issues (such as environmental degradation) and provoke behavioural and systemic change.

This is both due to the expansion of established categories of geographic information (e.g., digital maps and geospatial databases) and to the simultaneous enrichment of other types of information through geographic identifiers (e.g., geotags, check-ins, and global positioning system coordinates). As this repository of geographic information expands, it is also a key site for multiple processes of commodification transforming informational resources into market goods. Understanding the dynamics driving the integration of geographic information into the digital economy requires a comprehensive political economic analysis. A key component of this analysis is to explain the logics of creation and allocation of economic value from geographic information on the Internet. Addressing this need, in the present article I deploy the property regimes schema developed by Schlager and Ostrom and expand it to elucidate the differentiated commodification processes of geographic information on the Internet. Property regimes are arrangements that define rules, distribute rights, and delineate roles with respect to particular goods. These arrangements are enabled by elements such as legal frameworks, jurisdictions, type of information, and technologies of access. In this article, I explore how the legal frameworks regulating traditional categories of geographic information (such as maps) have been destabilized in the process of technological innovation, leading to the creation of new informational goods along with their respective property regimes, and rearticulating legal, economic, and sociotechnical relations. To illustrate this, I analyze the case of Google Street View images through their property regimes in various jurisdictions. © The Author(s) 2016.",commodification; digital economy; Geographic information; geoweb; Google Street View; property regimes,,,,,,,,,"Anguelov, D., Dulong, C., Filip, D., Google Street View: Capturing the world at street level (2010) Computer, 43, pp. 32-38; Becker, E., Buhse, W., Günnewig, D., (2003) Digital Rights Management, , Berlin, Heidelberg, Springer; Biddle, P., England, P., Peinado, M., (2003) The Darknet and the Future of Content Protection, pp. 155-176. , Berlin, Heidelberg, Springer; Blackstone, W., (1893) Commentaries on the Laws of England in Four Books, vol. 1 [1753].

Having briefly outlined how bodies contribute to targeting processes and the optimisation of the ads themselves, it progresses to detail industrial perspectives, intentions and attitudes to data ethics. Although the paper explores possibilities of this sector, it pays careful attention to existing practices that claim not to use personal data. Centrally, it argues that scholars and regulators need to pay attention to the principle of intimacy. This is developed to counter weaknesses in privacy that is typically based on identification. Having defined technologies, use cases, industrial perspectives, legal views and arguments about jurisprudence, the paper discusses this ensemble of perspectives in light of a nationwide survey about how UK citizens feel about the potential for emotion detection in out-of-home advertising. © The Author(s) 2016.",Advertising; biometric; emotion; policy; public; tracking,,,,,,,,,"Amin, A., (1994) Post-Fordism: A Reader, , London, John Wiley; Andrejevic, M., (2013) Infoglut: How too much Information is Changing the Way We Think and Know, , New York, NY, Routledge; Bakir, V., McStay, A., (2016) Veillant Media: ‘Veillant Panoptic Assemblage’ and ‘Emotiveillance’, , http://www.slideshare.net/Andrew_McStay/veillant-media-emotiveillance, University of Toronto, Available at:, accessed 26 July 2016; boyd, D., (2012) It's Complicated: The Social Lives of Networked Teens, , New Haven, CT, Yale University Press; Burnham, P., Lutz, K.G., Grant, W., (2008) Research Methods in Politics, , Houndmills, Palgrave Macmillan; Darwin, C., (1872) The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals, , London, Harper; Davies, W., (2015) The Happiness Industry, , London, Verso; Du Plessis, E., (2011) The Branded Mind, , London, Kogan Press; Ekman, P., Friesen, W.V., Constants across cultures in the face and emotion (1971) Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 17 (2), pp. 124-129; Ekman, P., Friesen, W.V., (1978) Facial Action Coding System: A Technique for the Measurement of Facial Movement, , Palo Alto, CA, Consulting Psychologists Press; Fridlund, A.J., (1995) Human Facial Expression: An Evolutionary View, , San Diego, CA, Academic Press Inc; Groves, R.M., Fowler, F.J., Jr., Couper, M.P., (2009) Survey Methodology, , New Jersey, Wiley; (2016) 2015 Full Year Digital Adspend Results, , http://www.iabuk.net/research/library/2015-full-year-digital-adspend-results, Available at:, accessed 20 April 2016; Kelly, K., (2008) Better than Free, , https://www.edge.org/conversation/better-than-free, Available at:, (accessed 20 July 2016); Kitchin, R., Big Data, new epistemologies and paradigm shifts (2014) Big Data & Society, , http://bds.sagepub.com/content/1/1/2053951714528481; Lazzarato, M., (2014) Signs and Machines: Capitalism and the Promotion of Subjectivity, , Los Angeles, CA, Semiotext(e; Leys, R., “Both of Us Disgusted in My Insula”: Mirror neuron theory and emotional empathy (2012) Nonsite.Org, , http://nonsite.org/article/%E2%80%9Cboth-of-us-disgusted-in-my-insula%E2%80%9D-mirror-neuron-theory-and-emotional-empathy, (accessed 19 November 2014); Mann, S., Ferenbok, J., New media and the power politics of sousveillance in a surveillance-dominated world (2013) Surveillance & Society, 11 (1-2), pp. 18-34; Marwick, A.E., boyd, D., Networked privacy: How teenagers negotiate context in social media (2014) New Media & Society, 16 (7), pp. 1051-1067; Mayer-Schönberger, V., Cukier, K., (2013) Big Data: A Revolution That Will Transform How We Live, Work and Think, , London, John Murray; McStay, A., (2011) The Mood of Information: A Critique of Online Behavioural Advertising, , New York, Continuum; McStay, A., Creativity and Advertising: Affect (2013) Events and Process, , London, Routledge; McStay, A., (2014) Privacy and Philosophy: New Media and Affective Protocol, , New York, Peter Lang; McStay, A., (2016) Digital Advertising, , London, Palgrave-Macmillan; McStay A (forthcoming) Empathic Media: The Surveillance of Emotional Life.

Von Foerster's conjecture is one of the early theoretical results that could help to understand these laws. Although neglected for a long time, the advent of the overlying layer of recommendation and ranking systems which is progressively occupying the web has given empirical evidences of this conjecture, which predicts the consequences of increasing inter-individual influences on social dynamics and the susceptibility of these latter to manipulation. With both von Foerster's conjecture and the Snowden revelations in the background, we analyse the impact of ICT on human societies and their governance, in view of the fact that they have a massive impact on the way in which people influence each other in their tastes and actions. © The Author(s) 2016.",Big Data; information and communication technologies; Information and technology governance; ranking systems; recommendation; Snowden revelations; social media; social networks,,,,,,,,,"Bollen, J., Mao, H., Zeng, X., Twitter mood predicts the stock market (2011) Journal of Computational Science, 2, pp. 1-8; Bourgine, P., Chavalarias, D., Cohen-Boulakia, C., (2008) Déterminismes Et complexités: Du Physique à l’éthique: Autour d’Henri Atlan, , Paris: Recherches.

Such efforts to measure popularity of users or exploit knowledge about their audience are complicated by the presence of fake profiles on these networks. In this study, analysis of 62 million publicly available Twitter user profiles was conducted and a strategy to identify automatically generated fake profiles was established. Using a combination of a pattern-matching algorithm on screen-names and an analysis of update times, a reasonable number (∼0.1% of total users) of highly reliable fake user accounts were identified. Analysis of profile creation times and URLs of these fake accounts revealed their distinct behavior relative to a ground truth data set. The characteristics of friends and followers of users in the two data sets further revealed the very different nature of the two groups. The ratio of number of followers-to-friends for ground truth users was ∼1, consistent with past observations, while the fake profiles had a median ratio ∼30, indicating that the fake users we identified were primarily focused on gathering friends. An analysis of the temporal evolution of accounts over 2 years showed that the friends-to-followers ratio increased over time for fake profiles while they decreased for ground truth users. Our results, thus, suggest that a profile-based approach can be used for identifying a core set of fake online social network users in a time-efficient manner. © The Author(s) 2016.",detection; fake profiles; followers; friends; online social networks; online social networks; Twitter,,,,,,,,,"Benevenuto, F., Magno, G., Rodrigues, T., Detecting spammers on twitter (2010) Collaboration, Electronic Messaging, Anti-Abuse and Spam Conference, p. 12; Bennett, E., Social media as a tool for improving research and teaching (2014) Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment, 12 (5), p. 259; Danezis, G., Mittal, P., (2009) Sybilinfer: Detecting Sybil Nodes Using Social Networks, , In, NDSS; Clark, E.M., Williams, J.R., Jones, C.A., Sifting robotic from organic text: A natural language approach for detecting automation on Twitter (2016) Journal of Computational Science, 16, pp. 1-7; Dawson, S., (2013) Is Twitter Telling the Truth about Their “active user” Stats?, , http://eggsbacon.co.nz/twitter, Available at; Douceur, J.R., The sybil attack (2002) Peer-to-Peer Systems, pp. 251-260. , Berlin Heidelberg: Springer; Gabielkov, M., Legout, A., The complete picture of the Twitter social graph (2012) Conext Student ‘12 Proceedings of ACM Conference on Conext Student Workshop, pp. 19-20. , New York, NY, USA; Grier, C., Thomas, K., Paxson, V., Spam: The underground on 140 characters or less (2010) Proceedings of the 17Th ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security, pp. 27-37; Gurajala, S., White, J.S., Hudson, B., Fake Twitter accounts: Profile characteristics obtained using an activity-based pattern detection approach (2015) Proceedings of the 2015 International Conference on Social Media & Society, p. 9. , July, ACM; Jiang, M., Cui, P., Beutel, A., Detecting suspicious following behavior in multimillion-node social networks (2014) Proceedings of the 23Rd International Conference on World Wide Web, pp. 305-306. , April, ACM; Jiang, M., Cui, P., Beutel, A., Catching synchronized behaviors in large networks: A graph mining approach (2016) ACM Transactions on Knowledge Discovery from Data (TKDD), , Vancouver; Kwak, H., Lee, C., Park, H., What is Twitter, a social network or a news media?

Many data controllers, such as social network sites, offer terms and conditions, privacy policies or similar documents to which a user can consent when registering as a user. There are many issues with such informed consent: people get too many consent requests to read everything, policy documents are often very long and difficult to understand and users feel they do not have a real choice anyway. Furthermore, in the context of Big Data refusing consent may not prevent predicting missing data. Finally, consent is usually asked for when registering, but rarely is consent renewed. As a result, consenting once often implies consent forever. At the same time, given the rapid changes in Big Data and data analysis, consent may easily get outdated (when earlier consent no longer reflects a user’s preferences). This paper suggests expiry dates for consent, not to settle questions, but to put them on the table as a start for further discussion on this topic. Although such expiry dates may not solve all the issues of informed consent, they may be a useful tool in some situations. © The Author(s) 2016.",Big Data; expiry dates; Informed consent; personal data; privacy,,,,,,,,,"Acquisti, A., Nudging privacy: The behavioral economics of personal information (2009) Security & Privacy Economics, 7 (6); Acquisti, A., Grosslags, J., Privacy and rationality in decision making (2005) IEEE Security and Privacy, 3 (1), pp. 26-33; Adjerid, I., Acquisti Brandimarte, L., Loewenstein, G., Sleights of privacy: Framing, disclosures, and the limits of transparency (2013) SOUPS ‘13 Proceedings of the Ninth Symposium on Usable Privacy and Security, , Article No. 9; Arcand, M., Nantel, J., Arles-Dufour, M., The impact of reading a web site’s privacy statement on perceived control over privacy and perceived trust (2007) Online Information Review, 31 (5), pp. 661-681; Ausloos, J., The right to be forgotten—Worth remembering?

Data produced by machines is most often ‘seen’ by other machines; the eye is in question is algorithmic. Algorithmic seeing does not produce a computational panopticon but a mechanism of prediction. The authority of its predictions rests on a slippage of the scientific method in to the world of data. Data science inherits some of the problems of science, especially the disembodied ‘view from above’, and adds new ones of its own. As its core methods like machine learning are based on seeing correlations not understanding causation, it reproduces the prejudices of its input. Rising in to the apparatuses of governance, it reinforces the problematic sides of ‘seeing like a state’ and links to the recursive production of paranoia. It forces us to ask the question ‘what counts as rational seeing?’. Answering this from a position of feminist empiricism reveals different possibilities latent in seeing with machines. Grounded in the idea of conviviality, machine learning may reveal forgotten non-market patterns and enable free and critical learning. It is proposed that a programme to challenge the production of irrational pre-emption is also a search for the possibility of algorithmic conviviality. © The Author(s) 2016.",Algorithms; big data; conviviality; machine learning; paranoia,,,,,,,,,"Abbott, E., (2015) Flatland: A Romance of Many Dimensions, Revised Edition, , ▪▪, CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform; Brugger, P., From haunted brain to haunted science: A cognitive neuroscience view of paranormal and pseudoscientific thought (2001) Hauntings and Poltergeists: Multidisciplinary Perspectives, pp. 195-213. , Houran J., Lange R., (eds), North Carolina, USA, McFarland, In:, (eds; Burrell, J., How the machine ‘thinks’: Understanding opacity in machine learning algorithms (2016) Big Data & Society, 3 (1), pp. 1-12; Buterin, V., Decentralized Court | /r/ethereum (2016) Reddit., , https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/4gigyd/decentralized_court/, (accessed 28 April 2016); Costello, N., Confessions of a former US Air Force drone technician (2015) Al Jazeera, , http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2016/04/confessions-air-force-drone-technician-afghanistan-160406114636155.html, 19 November, accessed 28 April 2016; Duhigg, C., How companies learn your secrets (2012) The New York Times, , http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/19/magazine/shopping-habits.html, 16 February.

Enticed by the grand promises of Big Data, public officials seem increasingly inclined to experiment with more data-driven forms of governance. But while the rise of Big Data and related consequences has been a major issue of concern across different disciplines, attempts to develop a better understanding of the phenomenon's historical foundations have been rare. This short commentary addresses this gap by situating the current push for numerical evidence within a broader socio-political context, demonstrating how the epistemological claims of Big Data science intersect with specific forms of trust, truth, and objectivity. We conclude by arguing that regulators' faith in numbers can be attributed to a distinct political culture, a representative democracy undermined by pervasive public distrust and uncertainty. © The Author(s) 2016.",Big Data; epistemology; evidence-based policy making; mechanical objectivity; quantification; trust in numbers,,,,,,,,,"Adams, V., Murphy, M., Clarke, A.E., Anticipation: Technoscience, life, affect, temporality (2009) Subjectivity, 28 (1), pp. 246-265; Anderson, C., (2009) The End of Theory: The Big Data Deluge Makes The Scientific Method Obsolete.

We frame police officer-involved homicide data as a rhetorical tool that can reify certain assumptions about the world and extend regimes of power. We highlight the possibility that this type of sensitive civic data can be investigated and employed within local communities through creative practice. Community involvement with data can create a countervailing force to powerful dominant narratives and supplement activist projects that hold local officials accountable for their actions. Our analysis examines four Los Angeles County police officer-involved homicide data sets. First, we provide accounts of the semantics, granularity, scale and transparency of this local data. Then, we describe a “counter data action,” an event that invited members of the community to identify the limits and challenges present in police officer-involved homicide data and to propose new methods for deriving meaning from these indicators and statistics. © The Author(s) 2016.",community; Data; hackathon; infrastructure; Los Angeles; police,,,,,,,"The authors thank Leah Lievrouw and Jonathan Furner in the Department of Information Studies at UCLA for supporting the Police Brutality Hackathon.

We provide a brief overview of these debates focusing particularly on what Paul Humphreys calls epistemic opacity. We argue that debates in Critical Data Studies and philosophy of science have neglected the problem of error management and error detection. This is an especially important feature of the epistemology of Big Data. In “Error” section we explain the main characteristics of error detection and correction along with the relationship between error and path complexity in software. In this section we provide an overview of conventional statistical methods for error detection and review their limitations when faced with the high degree of conditionality inherent to modern software systems. © The Author(s) 2016.,Big Data; complexity; Critical Data Studies; epistemology; error; software,,,,,,,,,"Amoore, L., Data derivatives on the emergence of a security risk calculus for our times (2011) Theory, Culture & Society, 28 (6), pp. 24-43; Amoore, L., Security and the incalculable (2014) Security Dialogue, , 0967010614539719; Anderson, C., (2008) The end of theory: The data deluge makes the scientific method obsolete, , http://www.wired.com/science/discoveries/magazine/16-07/pb_theory, (accessed 24 January 2016); Arbesman, S., (2013) Five Myths about Big Data. the Washington Post, , www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/five-myths-about-big-data/2013/08/15/64a0dd0a-e044-11e2-963a-72d740e88c12_story.html, August, Available at:, accessed 24 January 2016; Barberousse, A., Franceschelli, S., Imbert, C., Computer simulations as experiments (2009) Synthese, 169 (3), pp. 557-574; Barberousse, A., Vorms, M., About the warrants of computer-based empirical knowledge (2014) Synthese, 191 (15), pp. 3595-3620; Bauer, P., Thorpe, A., Brunet, G., The quiet revolution of numerical weather prediction (2015) Nature, 525 (7567), pp. 47-55; Bedau, M.A., Weak emergence (1997) Noûs, 31 (11), pp. 375-399; Berry, D.M., The philosophy of software (2011) Code and Mediation in the Digital Age, , London: Pal-grave; Bollier, D., Firestone, C.M., (2010) The Promise and Peril of Big Data, p. 56. , Washington, DC, Aspen Institute, Communications and Society Program; Boschetti, F., Fulton, E.A., Bradbury, R., What is a model, why people don’t trust them, and why they should (2012) Negotiating Our Future: Living Scenarios for Australia to2050, , Raupach M.R., McMichael T., Finnigan J.J., (eds), Canberra, ACT, Australian Academy of Science, In:, (eds; Boyd, D., Crawford, K., Critical questions for big data: Provocations for a cultural, technological, and scholarly phenomenon (2012) Information, Communication & Society, 15 (5), pp. 662-679; Brusoni, S., Prencipe, A., Unpacking the black box of modularity: Technologies, products and organizations (2001) Industrial and Corporate Change, 10 (1), pp. 179-205; Bryant, R., Katz, R.H., Lazowska, E.D., Big-data computing: Creating revolutionary breakthroughs in commerce (2008) Science and Society, pp. 1-15. , http://www.cra.org/ccc/docs/init/Big_Data.pdf, December; Bunge, M., A general black box theory (1963) Philosophy of Science, pp. 346-358; Chen, M., Mao, S., Liu, Y., Big Data: A survey (2014) Mobile Networks and Applications, 19 (2), pp. 171-209; Ciulla, F., Mocanu, D., Baronchelli, A., Beating the news using social media: The case study of American Idol (2012) EPJ Data Science, 1 (1), pp. 1-11; Cook, S., Conrad, C., Fowlkes, A.L., Assessing Google flu trends performance in the United States during the 2009 influenza virus A (H1N1) pandemic (2011) PloS One, 6 (8), p. e23610; Cox, M., Ellsworth, D., Application-controlled demand paging for out-of-core visualization (1997) Proceedings of the 8Th Conference on Visualization'97, Phoenix, AZ, USA, 18–24 October, p. 1997. , Los Alamitos, CA, IEEE Computer Society Press; Cukier, K., Mayer-Schoenberger, V., Rise of Big Data: How it's changing the way we think about the world, The (2013) Foreign Affairs, 92, p. 28; Ferziger, J.H., Peric, M., Computational Methods for Fluid Dynamics (2012) Springer Science & Business Media; Ethiraj, S.K., Levinthal, D., Modularity and innovation in complex systems (2004) Management Science, 50 (2), pp. 159-173; Floridi, L., Big Data and their epistemological challenge (2012) Philosophy & Technology, 25 (4), pp. 435-437; Floridi, L., Fresco, N., Primiero, G., On malfunctioning software (2015) Synthese, 192 (4), pp. 1199-1220. , and; Frické, M., Big Data and its epistemology (2015) Journal of the Association for Information Science and Technology, 66 (4), pp. 651-661; Frigg, R., Hartmann, S., Models in science (2012) The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, , http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2012/entries/models-science, Fall), Zalta EN (ed), Available at:, accessed 24 January 2016); Frigg, R., Reiss, J., The philosophy of simulation: Hot new issues or same old stew?

We examine a double-edged logic inscribed in these platforms, promising to offer personal solutions to medical problems while also contributing to the public good. On the one hand, online platforms serve as personalized data-driven services to their customers. On the other hand, they allegedly serve public interests, such as medical research or health education. In doing so, many apps employ a diffuse discourse, hinging on terms like “sharing,” “open,” and “reuse” when they talk about data extraction and distribution. The analytical approach we adopt in this article is situated at the nexus of science and technology studies, political economy, and the sociology of health and illness. The analysis concentrates on two aspects: datafication (the use and reuse of data) and commodification (a platform’s deployment of governance and business models). We apply these analytical categories to three specific platforms: 23andMe, PatientsLikeMe, and Parkinson mPower. The last section will connect these individual examples to the wider implications of health apps’ data flows, governance policies, and business models. Regulatory bodies commonly focus on the (medical) safety and security of apps, but pay scarce attention to health apps’ techno-economic governance. Who owns user-generated health data and who gets to benefit? We argue that it is important to reflect on the societal implications of health data markets. Governments have the duty to provide conceptual clarity in the grand narrative of transforming health care and health research. © The Author(s) 2016.",datafication; digital platforms; health apps; mHealth; open data; social media,,,,,,,,,"Adibi, S., (2015) Mobile Health: A Technology Road Map, , Bern, Springer; Andrejevic, M., The Big Data divide (2014) International Journal of Communication, 8, pp. 1673-1689; Andrejevic, M., Burdon, M., Defining the sensor society (2015) Television and New Media, 16 (1), pp. 19-36; Banning, M.E., Shared entanglements.

(All names are pseudonyms.) I examine two different kinds of practices that make air pollution data, focusing on how they relate to particular modes of sensing and articulating air pollution. I begin by describing the interstitial spaces involved in making measurements of air pollution at monitoring sites and in the running of a computer simulation. Specifically, I attend to a shared dimension of these practices, the checking of a numerical reading for error. Checking a measurement for error is routine practice and a fundamental component of making data, yet these are also moments of interpretation, where the form and meaning of numbers are ambiguous. Through two case studies of modelling and monitoring data practices, I show that making a ‘good’ (error free) measurement requires developing a feeling for the instrument–air pollution interaction in terms of the intended functionality of the measurements made. These affective dimensions of practice are useful analytically, making explicit the interaction of standardised ways of knowing and embodied skill in stabilising data. I suggest that environmental data practices can be studied through researchers’ materialisation of error, which complicate normative accounts of Big Data and highlight the non-linear and entangled relations that are at work in the making of stable, accurate data. © The Author(s) 2016.",air pollution; data practices; Environmental data; error; modelling; monitoring,,,,,,"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, LSHTM","Special thanks to researchers on the WHAP project whose patience and support made this research possible.

It does so by drawing on the version control system Git as a case study, and telling the story of its initial development in order to reconstruct the circumstances and technical considerations surrounding its conception. This account engages with computational infrastructures on their own terms by adopting the figure of the ‘stack’ to frame a technically informed analysis, and exploring its implications for a different kind of geographic inquiry. Drawing on topology as employed by Law and Mol, attention is given to the multiplicity of spatialities and temporalities enrolled in digital infrastructures in general, and Git specifically. Along the lines of the case study and by reading it against other literatures, this notion of topology is expanded to include the material performation of fundamentally arbitrary, more-than-human topologies, as well as their nested articulation, translation and negotiation within digital infrastructures. © The Author(s) 2016.",Git; infrastructure; stack; technology; topology; version control,,,,,,,,,"Allen, J., Topological twists: Power’s shifting geographies (2011) Dialogues in Human Geography, 1 (3), pp. 283-298; Amin, A., Regions unbound: Towards a new politics of place (2004) Geografiska Annaler: Series B, Human Geography, 86 (1), pp. 33-44; Aoyama, Y., Sheppard, E., The dialectics of geographic and virtual space (2003) Environment and Planning A, 35 (7), pp. 1151-1156; Barad, K., Posthumanist performativity: Toward an understanding of how matter comes to matter (2003) Signs: Journal of Women in Culture and Society, 28 (3), pp. 801-831; Barad, K., Quantum entanglements and hauntological relations of inheritance: Dis/continuities, spacetime enfoldings, and justice-to-come (2010) Derrida Today, 3 (2), pp. 240-268; Batty, M., Virtual geography (1997) Futures, 29 (4-5), pp. 337-352; Benkler, Y., (2006) The Wealth of Networks: How Social Production Transforms Markets and Freedom, , New Haven, CT, Yale University Press; Braden, R., Requirements for Internet Hosts: Communication Layers (1989) RFC 1122.

Rather than treat Big Data as only scientifically empirical and therefore largely neutral phenomena, CDS advocates the view that Big Data should be seen as always-already constituted within wider data assemblages. Assemblages is a concept that helps capture the multitude of ways that already-composed data structures inflect and interact with society, its organization and functioning, and the resulting impact on individuals’ daily lives. CDS questions the many assumptions about Big Data that permeate contemporary literature on information and society by locating instances where Big Data may be naively taken to denote objective and transparent informational entities.

Yet, there has been relatively little attention paid to the development of methodologies for handling this kind of data. The few works that exist in this area often reflect upon the implications of ‘grand’ social science methodological concepts for new social media research (i.e. they focus on general issues such as sampling, data validity, ethics, etc.). By contrast, we advance an abductively oriented methodological suite designed to explore the construction of phenomena played out through social media. To do this, we use a software tool – Chorus – to illustrate a visual analytic approach to data. Informed by visual analytic principles, we posit a two-by-two methodological model of social media analytics, combining two data collection strategies with two analytic modes. We go on to demonstrate each of these four approaches ‘in action’, to help clarify how and why they might be used to address various research questions. © The Author(s) 2016.",analytics; data visualisation; digital social science; methods; Social media; Twitter,,,,,,,,,"Anderson, C.W., Deliberative, agonistic, and algorithmic audiences: Journalism’s vision of its public in an age of audience (2011) International Journal of Communication, 5, pp. 529-547; Blaikie, N., (2000) Designing Social Research: The Logic of Anticipation, , Cambridge, Polity Press; boyd, D., Social network sites as networked publics: Affordances, dynamics, and implications (2010) A Networked Self: Identity, Community, and Culture on Social Network Sites, pp. 39-58. , Paachrissi Z., (ed), Abingdon, UK, Routledge, In:, (ed; boyd, D., Crawford, K., Critical questions for big data (2012) Information, Communication & Society, 15 (5), pp. 662-679; Boyd D, G.S., Lotan, G., Tweet, tweet, retweet: Conversational aspects of retweeting on Twitter (2010) Proceedings of the 43Rd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences, pp. 1-10. , Hawaii, USA, 5–8 January 2010, IEEE Computer Society; Brügger, N., Finnemann, N.O., The web and digital humanities: Theoretical and methodological concerns (2013) Journal of Broadcasting and Electronic Media, 57 (1), pp. 66-80; Bruns, A., Burgess, J.E., The use of Twitter hashtags in the formation of ad hoc publics (2011) Proceedings of the 6Th European Consortium for Political Research (ECPR) General Conference, , Reykjavik, Iceland, 24–27 August 2011; Burnap, P., Williams, M.L., Sloan, L., Tweeting the terror: Modelling the social media reaction to the Woolwich terrorist attack (2014) Social Network Analysis and Mining, 4 (1), pp. 1-14; Card, S., Mackinlay, J., Shneiderman, B., (1999) Readings in Information Visualization: Using Vision to Think, , New York, Morgan Kaufmann; Cui, W., Lin, S., Tan, L., TextFlow: Towards better understanding of evolving topics in text (2011) IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics, 17 (2), pp. 2412-2421; Diakopoulos, N., Naaman, M., Kivran-Swaine, F., Diamonds in the rough: Social media visual analytics for journalistic enquiry In:IEEE Symposium on Visual Analytics Science and Technology, , Salt Lake City, UT, USA, 25–26 October 2010,.115–122.

Locating Spatial Big Data in the historical and geographical contexts of Sydney and Hong Kong, it traces how situated knowledges mediate and moderate the rising potency of discourses of cartographic reason and data logics as colonial cartographic imaginations expressed in land divisions and urban planning continue on, in a world that increasingly values models of calculability, interoperability and authority. It draws on ethnographic material gathered through walking interviews in both cities, and in doing so, it argues that by using ethnographic ‘moments’, it is possible to decentre the focus on data processes to consider the critical potential of a politics of everyday experiences that produce and reflect the structures of data logics. Through these ethnographic moments, this article examines how mobile technologies are complicit in the production of Spatial Big Data, and the impact this has on the increasing regimentation and surveillance of modes of being and expression via mobile media. At the same time, it will argue that while spatial calculability has expanded from cartographic reason into data logics, the epistemological universality of Spatial Big Data is constantly being resisted – in moments of experimentation, failure, intuition, memory and desire, the ghosts of the incalculable epistemes, experiences and people, forgotten by the emphasis on calculation, continue to speak. © The Author(s) 2016.",Big Data; Critical cartography; ethnography; Hong Kong; postcolonial; Sydney,,,,,,,,,"Abbas, A., (1997) Hong Kong: Culture and the Politics of Disappearance, , Hong Kong, China, Hong Kong University Press; Anderson, C., The end of theory: The data deluge makes the scientific method obsolete (2008) Wired Magazine, , 16:07.

The data journeys approach contributes to the development of critical, qualitative methodologies that can address the geographic and temporal scale of emerging knowledge infrastructures, and capture the ‘life of data’ from their initial generation through to re-use in different contexts. We discuss the theoretical development of the data journeys methodology and the application of the approach on a project examining meteorological data on their journey from initial production through to being re-used in climate science and financial markets. We then discuss three key conceptual findings from this project about: (1) the socio-material constitution of digital data objects, (2) ‘friction’ in the movement of data through space and time and (3) the mutability of digital data as a material property that contributes to driving the movement of data between different sites of practice. © The Author(s) 2016.",Big Data; Critical data studies; data cultures; data flow; data materiality; data practices,,,,,,,,,"Beer, D., Burrows, R., Popular culture, digital archives and the new social life of data (2013) Theory, Culture & Society, 30 (4), pp. 47-71; Bieler, A., Morton, A.D., The Gordian Knot of agency—structure in international relations: A neo-Gramscian perspective (2001) European Journal of International Relations, 7 (1), pp. 5-35; Bieler, A., Morton, A.D., The deficits of discourse in IPE: Turning base metal into gold?

It proposes a conceptual framework and demonstrates the empirical potential of a pragmatic approach based on reading published materials and available documentation. Facebook’s Data Warehousing and Analytics Infrastructure serves as an illustrative example to begin tracing out and describe data assemblages in more detail. In being attentive to the motivations, drivers and challenges engineers face when dealing with Big Data, it is argued that their solutions can enable and support but also constrain specific analytical and transactional capabilities or data flows between various devices and actors. The analysis thus moves beyond methodological critiques of the utility of Big Data that lack empirical support and specificity. It is further argued that analytics not just describe but also actively participate in the enactment of social worlds, thereby opening possibilities for new markets or market segments to arise. Online sociality accounts for a model of the social that makes it visible and measurable qua markets inviting data recontextualisation and the creation of value along multiple axes. Contra Facebook’s claim to make the web more ‘social’, an investigation of commensuration brings to the fore the question how the social is accounted for in the first place. © The Author(s) 2016.",Big Data; Commensuration; cultural techniques; data analytics; data infrastructure; Facebook,,,,,,,,,"Agneeswaran, V.S., (2014) Big Data Analytics Beyond Hadoop: Real-Time Applications with Storm, Spark, and More Hadoop Alternatives, , Uer Saddle River, NJ, Pearson Education, Inc; Ahuja, S.P., Moore, B., State of Big Data analysis in the cloud (2013) Network and Communication Technologies, 2 (1), pp. 62-68; Aiyer, A., Bautin, M., Chen, G.J., Storage infrastructure behind Facebook messages using HBase at scale (2012) Bulletin of the IEEE Computer Society Technical Committee on Data Engineering, 35 (2), pp. 4-13; Anderson, C., The end of theory: The data deluge makes the scientific method obsolete (2008) Wired Magazine, 16 (7). , http://www.wired.com/science/discoveries/magazine/16-07/pb_theory, 23 June, (accessed 8 February 2015); Andrejevic, M., The Big Data divide (2014) International Journal of Communication, 8 (10), pp. 1673-1689; (2013) Hadoop 1.2.1 Documentation., , http://hadoop.apache.org/docs/r1.2.1/, Available at, accessed 8 February 2015); Argote, L., (2013) Organizational Learning: Creating, Retaining and Transferring Knowledge, , Boston, MA, Springer US; Barocas, S., Selbst, A.D., (2014) Big Data’s Disparate Impact, , http://ssrn.com/abstract=2477899, SSRN Working Paper Series, Social Science Research Network, USA, August, Available at:, accessed 8 February 2015; Becker, B.C., Ortiz, E.G., Evaluation of face recognition techniques for application to Facebook (2009) FG ‘08 Proceedings of the 8Th IEEE International Conference on Automatic Face & Gesture Recognition, pp. 1-6. , Amsterdam, the Netherlands, 17–19 September 2008, IEEE Xplore; Beyer, M., Gartner says solving ‘Big Data’ challenge involves more than just managing volumes of data (2011) Gartner, , http://www.gartner.com/newsroom/id/1731916, Available at:, (accessed 2 September 2015); Bijker, W.E., Law, J., (1992) Shaping Technology/Building Society: Studies in Sociotechnical Change, , Cambridge, MA, The MIT Press; Bijker, W.E., Hughes, T.P., Pinch, T.J., (1987) The Social Construction of Technological Systems: New Directions in the Sociology and History of Technology, , Cambridge, MA, The MIT Press; Borthakur, D., Rash, S., Schmidt, R., Apache Hadoop goes realtime at Facebook (2011) SIGMOD ‘11 Proceedings of the 2011 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data, pp. 1071-1080. , Athens, Greece, 12–16 June 2011, New York, ACM Press; Borthakur, D., HDFS Architecture guide (2013) Hadoop 1.2.1 Documentation, , http://hadoop.apache.org/docs/r1.2.1/hdfs_design.html, Available at:, accessed 8 February 2015; Dmcrawford, B., Six provocations for Big Data (2011) A Decade in Internet Time: Symposium on the Dynamics of the Internet Society, pp. 1-17. , Oxford, UK, 21–24 September 2011; boyd, D., Crawford, K., Critical questions for Big Data (2012) Information, Communication & Society, 15 (5), pp. 662-679; Bozkır, A.S., Güzin Mazman, S., Akçapınar Sezer, E., Identification of user patterns in social networks by data mining techniques: Facebook case (2010) Technological Convergence and Social Networks in Information Management, Communications in Computer and Information Science, 96, pp. 145-153. , Kurbanoğlu S., Al U., Lepon Erdoğan P., (eds), Berlin, Springer-Verlag, In:, (eds; Burchell, S., Clubb, C., Hopwood, A.G., Accounting in its social context: Towards a history of value added in the United Kingdom (1985) Accounting, Organizations and Society, 10 (4), pp. 381-413; Burns, J., Scapens, R.W., Conceptualizing management accounting change: An institutional framework (2000) Management Accounting Research, 11 (1), pp. 3-25; Burrows, R., Savage, M., After the crisis?

Through an engagement with debates about the notion of affordances, which focus on the relation between the technical and the social, we put forward an approach to study the production of data within platforms by engaging with the material properties of platforms as well as their interpretation and deployment by various types of users. As a case in point, we study how the affordances of Wikipedia are deployed in the production of encyclopedic knowledge and how this can be used to study controversies. The analysis shows how Wikipedia affords unstable encyclopedic knowledge by having mechanisms in place that suggest the continuous (re)negotiation of existing knowledge. We furthermore showcase the use of our open-source software, Contropedia, which can be utilized to study knowledge production on Wikipedia. © The Author(s) 2016.",affordances; controversy mapping; devices; Digital methods; platform studies; Wikipedia,,,,,,,"We would like to thank the reviewers and editors from BD&S for their useful comments.

We argue that all data, including Big Data, are socially constructed artefacts that reflect the contexts and processes of their creation. To support our argument, we qualitatively analysed the process of ‘Big Data making’ that occurred by way of crowdsourcing through open data platforms, in the context of two specific humanitarian crises, namely the 2010 earthquake in Haiti and the 2015 earthquake in Nepal. We show that the process of creating Big Data from local and global sources of knowledge entails the transformation of information as it moves from one distinct group of contributors to the next. The implication of this transformation is that locally based, affected people and often the original ‘crowd’ are excluded from the information flow, and from the interpretation process of crowdsourced crisis knowledge, as used by formal responding organizations, and are marginalized in their ability to benefit from Big Data in support of their own means. Our paper contributes a critical perspective to the debate on participatory Big Data, by explaining the process of in and exclusion during data making, towards more responsive humanitarian relief. © The Author(s) 2016.",Big Data; crowdsourcing; Disaster; Haiti; humanitarian; Nepal,,,,,,,"The authors wish to thank the people at Kathmandu Living Labs, Code for Nepal, Accountability Lab, Local Interventions Group, Oxfam Novib, Cordaid and all other respondents who generously shared their time with us towards realizing this study.

The combination of technological capacity, legislative change and antidemocratic sentiments of the State, in the context of its willingness and ability to collect and process Big Data on an unprecedented scale, disrupt the preconditions for a strong democracy based on free media and free citizens. This paper examines the politics of investigative journalism under the conditions of dominance of the State by investigating the experiences of journalists with surveillance. Our interviews with 48 journalists show that journalists are acutely aware of surveillance and its noxious impact. Well beyond simple ‘watching’ these experiences are remarkably similar in non-Western and Western countries. Journalists are engaging increasingly with technological and other communities, as they aim to defend journalism and their lives. Their activism is operationalised in three areas: (a) in reluctant often-fraught cooperation with hacktivists, (b) in self-directed protection of communications and sources and (c) in not always willingly acting as dissenters vis-a-vis the State. This paper explores the extent to which journalists consider equilibrium to be distorted, and how they are countering any slide into subdued democracy. © The Author(s) 2016.",activism; freedom of information; journalism; law; press freedom; Surveillance,,,,,,,,,"Alwood, E., Watching the watchdogs: FBI spying on Journalists in the 1940s (2007) Journalism & Mass Communication Quarterly, 84 (1), pp. 137-150; (2016) Surveillance under the Patriot Act, , https://www.aclu.org/infographic/surveillance-under-patriot-act, (accessed 29 April 2016); Andrejevic, M., The discipline of watching: Detection, risk, and lateral surveillance (2006) Critical Studies in Media Communication, (23), pp. 391-407; Bakir, V., News, agenda building, and intelligence agencies (2015) The International Journal of Press/Politics, 20 (2), pp. 131-144; Bakir, V., (2013) Torture, Intelligence and Sousveillance in the War on Terror: Agenda-building Struggles, , Farnham, UK, Ashgate Publishing; Bakir, V., (2010) Sousveillance, Media and Strategic Political Communication: Iraq, USA, UK, , New York, NY, Continuum; Bauman, Z., Bigo, D., Esteves, P., After Snowden: Rethinking the impact of surveillance (2014) International Political Sociology, 8 (2), pp. 121-144; (2014) Edward Snowden: Leaks that Exposed US Spy Programme, , http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-23123964, Available at:, accessed 29 April 2016; Campbell, J.E., Carlson, M., Panopticon.com: Online surveillance and the commodification of privacy (2002) Journal of Broadcasting & Electronic Media, 46 (4), pp. 586-606; (2015) Resolution 2045 (2015) Mass Surveillance, , http://assembly.coe.int/nw/xml/XRef/Xref-XML2HTML-EN.asp?fileid=21692&lang=en, (accessed 22 July 2016); (2015) Nils Muižnieks: Democratic Oversight of National Security Services in Europe Remains “largely Ineffective, , http://www.humanrightseurope.org/2015/06/nils-muiznieks-democratic-oversight-of-national-security-services-in-europe-remains-largely-ineffective/, (accessed 14 July 2016); Dover, R., Goodman, M.S., (2009) Spinning Intelligence: Why Intelligence Needs the Media, Why the Media Needs Intelligence, , London, UK, C Hurst; (2016) In hearing on Internet surveillance, nobody knows how many Americans impacted in data collection, , https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/05/hearing-internet-surveillance-nobody-knows-how-many-americans-impacted-data, (accessed 15 July 2016); Elmer, G., A diagram of panoptic surveillance (2003) New Media & Society, 5 (2), pp. 231-247; Fernback, J., Sousveillance: Communities of resistance to the surveillance environment (2013) Telematics & Informatics, 30 (1), pp. 11-21; (2013) Metadata May Not Catch Many Terrorists but it’s Great at Busting journalists’ Sources, , http://foreignpolicy.com/2013/09/24/metadata-may-not-catch-many-terrorists-but-its-great-at-busting-journalists-sources/, Available at:, accessed 29 April 2016; (2016), https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-press/freedom-press-2016, Freedom of the press 2016, accessed 29 April 2016; Ganascia, J.G., The generalized sousveillance society (2010) Special issue: Digitize and transfer, 49 (3), pp. 489-507; (2016) Sweeping Surveillance Powers Planned by Dutch Government, , http://www.irishtimes.com/news/world/europe/sweeping-surveillance-powers-planned-by-dutch-government-1.2615109, Available at:, accessed 29 April 2016; Lang, G.E., Lang, K., Watergate: An exploration of the agenda building process (1981) Mass Communication Review Yearbook, 2, pp. 447-468. , Wilhoit G.C., DeBock H., (eds), Beverly Hills, CA, Sage, In:, (eds; Lyon, D., (2015) Surveillance after Snowden, , Cambridge, UK, Polity Press; Lyon, D., (2003) Surveillance after September 11, , Cambridge, UK, Polity Press; Mann, S., Ferenbok, J., New media and the power politics of sousveillance in a surveillance-dominated world (2013) Surveillance and Society, 11 (1-2), pp. 18-34; Mann, S., Fung, J., Lo, R., Cyberglogging with camera phones: Steps towards equiveillance (2006) Multimedia: Proceedings of the 14Th Annual ACM International Conference, (MULTIMEDIA ‘06), pp. 177-180. , Santa Barbara, CA, USA, 23–27 October 2006; Mann, S., Nolan, J., Wellman, B., Sousveillance: Inventing and using wearable computing devices for data collection in surveillance environments (2003) Surveillance & Society, 1 (3), pp. 331-355; (2013) Journalism is Still at Work Even When Its Practitioner has a Slant, , http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/01/business/media/journalism-is-still-at-work-even-when-its-practitioner-has-a-slant.html?_r=0, Available at:, accessed 22 July 2016; (2014) What’s the Difference between Activism and Journalism?, , http://niemanreports.org/articles/whats-the-difference-between-activism-and-journalism/, accessed 22 July 2016; (2014) Can Journalists Be Activists?

It argues that within the history of social statistics we have a relatively well developed history of the material phenomenon of Big Data. Yet this article argues that we now need to take the concept of ‘Big Data’ seriously, there is a pressing need to explore the type of work that is being done by that concept. The article suggests a programme for work that explores the emergence of the concept of Big Data so as to track the institutional, organisational, political and everyday adoption of this term. It argues that the term Big Data has the effect of making-up data and, as such, is powerful in framing our understanding of those data and the possibilities that they afford. © The Author(s) 2016.",Big Data; concept; discursive framing; Foucault; history; Ian Hacking,,,,,,,,,"Ajana, B., (2013) Governing Through Biometrics: The Biopolitics of Identity, , Basingstoke, Palgrave Macmillan; Beer, D., (2016) Metric Power, , London, Palgrave Macmillan; Bhambra, G.K., (2014) Connected Sociologies, , London, Bloomsbury; boyd, D., Crawford, K., Critical questions for big data: Provocations for a cultural, technological and scholarly phenomenon (2012) Information, Communication & Society, 15 (5), pp. 662-679; Day, R., (2014) Indexing it All: The Subject in the Age of Documentation, Information, and Data, , Cambridge, MA, MIT Press; Desrosières, A., (1998) The Politics of Numbers: A History of Statistical Reasoning, , Cambridge, MA, Harvard University Press; Elden, S., (2006) Speaking Against Number: Heidegger, Language and the Politics of Calculation, , Edinburgh, Edinburgh University Press; Elden, S., Governmentality, calculation, territory (2007) Environment and Planning D: Society and Space, 25 (3), pp. 562-580; Elden, S., How should we do the history of territory?

The production of these data has prompted the development of exploratory data-driven computing experiments that seek to find ways to extract value and insight from them. These projects often start from the data, rather than from a question or theory, and try to imagine and identify their potential utility. In this paper, we explore the desires and mechanics of data-driven computing experiments. We demonstrate how both locative media data and computing experiments are ‘staged’ to create new values and computing techniques, which in turn are used to try and derive possible futures that are ridden with unintended consequences. We argue that using computing experiments to imagine potential urban futures produces effects that often have little to do with creating new urban practices. Instead, these experiments promote Big Data science and the prospect that data produced for one purpose can be recast for another and act as alternative mechanisms of envisioning urban futures. © The Author(s) 2016.",computing experiments; critical data studies; Data analytics; location-based social network; locative media; staging; urban future,,,,,,,,,"Adey, P., Facing airport security: Affect, biopolitics, and the preemptive securitisation of the mobile body (2009) Environment and Planning D: Society and Space, 27 (2), pp. 274-295; Ahas, R., Silm, S., Järv, O., Using mobile positioning data to model locations meaningful to users of mobile phones (2010) Journal of Urban Technology, 17 (1), pp. 3-27; Amoore, L., Data derivatives on the emergence of a security risk calculus for our times (2011) Theory, Culture and Society, 28 (6), pp. 24-43; Amoore, L., Hall, A., Taking people apart: Digitised dissection and the body at the border (2009) Environment and Planning D: Society and Space, 27 (3), pp. 444-464; Anderson, B., Preemption, precaution, preparedness: Anticipatory action and future geographies (2010) Progress in Human Geography, 34 (6), pp. 777-798; Anderson, C., (2008) The End of Theory: The Data Deluge Makes The Scientific Method Obsolete, , http://www.wired.com/science/discoveries/magazine/16-07/pb_theory, Wired, 23 June 2008, (accessed 15 September 2015); Barnes, T.J., Wilson, M.W., Big Data, social physics, and spatial analysis: The early years (2014) Big Data and Society, 1 (1), pp. 1-14; Barreneche, C., Wilken, R., Platform specificity and the politics of location data extraction (2015) European Journal of Cultural Studies, 18 (4-5), pp. 497-513; Barry, A., Thrift, N., Gabriel Tarde: Imitation, invention and economy (2007) Economy and Society, 36 (4), pp. 509-525; Borup, M., Brown, N., Konrad, K., The sociology of expectations in science and technology (2006) Technology Analysis and Strategic Management, 18 (3-4), pp. 285-298; boyd, D., Crawford, K., Critical questions for Big Data: Provocations for a cultural, technological, and scholarly phenomenon (2012) Information, Communication and Society, 15 (5), pp. 662-679; Brown, N., Kraft, A., Martin, P., The promissory pasts of blood stem cells (2006) BioSocieties, 1 (3), pp. 329-348; Brown, N., Michael, M., A Sociology of expectations: Retrospecting prospects and prospecting retrospects (2003) Technology Analysis and Strategic Management, 15 (1), pp. 3-18; Cho, E., Myers, S.A., Leskovec, J., Friendship and mobility: User movement in location-based social networks (2011) In: Proceedings of the 17Th International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, pp. 1082-1090. , San Diego, CA, USA, 21–24 August 2011, NY: ACM; Ciolfi, L., Avram, G., Digital social interactions in the city: Reflecting on location-based social networks (2016) Code and the City, pp. 91-104. , Kitchin R., Perng S.-Y., (eds), London, Routledge, In:, (eds; Cramer, H., Rost, M., Holmquist, L.E., Performing a check-in: Emerging practices, norms and ‘conflicts’ in location-sharing using Foursquare (2011) Proceedings of the International Conference on Human Computer Interaction with Mobile Devices and Services, pp. 57-66. , Stockholm, Sweden, 30 August–2 September 2011, NY: ACM; Dalton, C., Thatcher, J., What does a critical data studies look like, and why do we care?

We analyse the representation of geoengineering on Wikipedia as a way of opening up this dominating, if contested, model for further debate. We achieve this by contrasting the dominating model as presented in the encyclopaedic article texts with the patterns of hyper-link associations between the articles. Two datasets were created tracing the geoengineering construct on Wikipedia, shedding light on its boundary with its context, as well as on its internal structure. The analysis shows that the geoengineering category tends to be associated on Wikipedia primarily with atmospheric solar radiation management rather than land-based carbon dioxide removal type technologies. The results support the notion that the dominant model of defining and classifying geoengineering technology has been beneficial for solar radiation management type technologies more than for land-based carbon dioxide removal ones. The article also demonstrates that controversy mapping with Wikipedia data affords analysis that can open up dominating definitions and classifications of technologies, and offer resistance to their frequent naturalising and decontextualising tendencies.

Recognizing this potential, platform providers increasingly restrict free access to such data. This shift provides new challenges for social scientists and other non-profit researchers who seek to analyze public posts with a purpose of better understanding human interaction and improving the human condition. This paper seeks to outline some of the recent changes in social media data analysis, with a focus on Twitter, specifically. Using Twitter data from a 24-hour period following The Sisters in Spirit Candlelight Vigil, sponsored by the Native Women’s Association of Canada, this article compares three free-use Twitter application programming interfaces for capturing tweets and enabling analysis. Although recent Twitter data restrictions limit free access to tweets, there are many dynamic options for social scientists to choose from in the capture and analysis of Twitter and other social media platform data. This paper calls for critical social media data analytics combined with traditional, qualitative methods to address the developing ‘data gold rush.’ © The Author(s) 2016.",critical data studies; Data analytics; meta-analysis; network analysis; social media; Twitter,,,,,,,The author would like to thank Dr Joanna Redden for her advice and mentorship during the writing of this article as well as the reviewers who provided constructive feedback.,,"Ahmed, W., A list of tools to capture Twitter data (2015) A Blog about Software, Analytics, Tricks, Tips, and Occasional Opinion, , https://wasimahmed1.wordpress.com/2015/01/30/a-list-of-tools-to-capture-twitter-data/, 30 January, Wasim Ahmed, accessed 17 November 2015; Berry, D.M., (2014) Critical Theory and the Digital, , New York, NY, Bloomsbury Academic; Borra, E., Rieder, B., Programmed method: Developing a toolset for capturing and analyzing tweets (2014) Aslib Journal of Information Management, 66 (3), pp. 262-278; boyd, D., Crawford, K., Critical questions for big data: Provocations for a cultural, technological, and scholarly phenomenon (2012) Information, Communication & Society, 15 (5), pp. 662-679; Bowker, G., (2005) Memory Practices in the Sciences, , Cambridge, MA, MIT Press; Bruns, A., How long is a Tweet?

Neutrality construction comprises an important element sustaining the company’s economic position and is reflected in constant updates, estimates and changes to utility and relevance of search results. Providing a purely technical solution to these issues proves to be increasingly difficult without a human hand in steering algorithmic solutions. Search relevance fluctuates and shifts through continuous tinkering and tweaking of the search algorithm. The company also uses third parties to hire human raters for performing quality assessments of algorithmic updates and adaptations in linguistically and culturally diverse global markets. The adaptation process contradicts the technical foundations of the company and calculations based on the initial Page Rank algorithm. Annual market reports, Google’s Search Quality Rating Guidelines, and reports from media specialising in search engine optimisation business are analysed. The Search Quality Rating Guidelines document provides a rare glimpse into the internal architecture of search algorithms and the notions of utility and relevance which are presented and structured as neutral and objective. Intertwined layers of ideology, hidden labour of human raters, advertising revenues, market dominance and control are discussed throughout the paper. © The Author(s) 2016.",culture; digital labour; Google; ideology; search algorithm,,,,,,"California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo","I wish to thank my colleagues from the Dynamics of Virtual Work COST action, especially Vladimir Cvijanovi? who provided valuable input in the early stages of this study.

Focusing on the Open Knowledge Foundation Germany and drawing from a combination of interviews and content analysis, it argues that this process leads activists to develop new rationalities around datafication that can support the agency of datafied publics. Three modulations of open source are identified: First, by regarding data as a prerequisite for generating knowledge, activists transform the sharing of source code to include the sharing of raw data. Sharing raw data should break the interpretative monopoly of governments and would allow people to make their own interpretation of data about public issues. Second, activists connect this idea to an open and flexible form of representative democracy by applying the open source model of participation to political participation. Third, activists acknowledge that intermediaries are necessary to make raw data accessible to the public. This leads them to an interest in transforming journalism to become an intermediary in this sense. At the same time, they try to act as intermediaries themselves and develop civic technologies to put their ideas into practice. The article concludes with suggesting that the practices and ideas of open data activists are relevant because they illustrate the connection between datafication and open source culture and help to understand how datafication might support the agency of publics and actors outside big government and big business. © The Author(s) 2015.",agency; civic technologies; hacking culture; journalism; Open data; open source,,,,,,,,,"Baack, S., Die Open-Data-Bewegung (2013) Das Verhältnis Von Praktiken, Zielen Und Selbstbild Der Open Knowledge Foundation Deutschland, , http://nbn-resolving.de/urn:nbn:de:0168-ssoar-363745, .

Its focus on a particular ‘community’ is presented as advantageous in overcoming the sheer scale of data available on the Web; yet, it is argued that these ethnographic boundaries may be flawed if they do not map onto the collective self-perception of the London French. The approach establishes several theoretical meeting points between Pierre Bourdieu’s ethnography and Gunther Kress’s multimodal social semiotics, notably, the foregrounding of practice and the meaning-making potentialities of the everyday; the implications of language and categorisation; the interplay between (curating/researcher) subject and (curated/research) object; evolving notions of agency, authorship and audience; together with social engagement, and the archive as dynamic process and product. The curation rationale proposed stems from Bourdieu’s three-stage field analysis model, which places a strong emphasis on habitus, considered to be most accurately (re)presented through blogs, yet necessitates its contextualisation within the broader (diasporic) field(s), through institutional websites, for example, whilst advocating a reflexive awareness of the researcher/curator’s (subjective) role. This, alongside the Kressian acknowledgement of the inherent multimodality of on-line resources, lends itself convincingly to selection and valuation strategies, whilst the discussion of language, genre, authorship and audience is relevant to the potential cataloguing of Web objects. By conceptualising the culturally themed selective Web-archiving process within the ethnosemiotic framework constructed, concrete recommendations emerge regarding curation, classification and crowd-sourcing. © The Author(s) 2015.",Bourdieu; curation; ethnosemiotics; Kress; multimodality; Selective Web archiving,,,,,,,,,"Abbott, D., Kim, Y., Genre classification (2008) Digital Curation Centre Briefing Papers: Introduction to Curation, , http://www.dcc.ac.uk/resources/briefing-papers/introduction-curation/genre-classification, Available at, (accessed 18 November 2013); Adami, E., Kress, G., (2010) The social semiotics of convergent mobile devices: New forms of composition and the transformation of habitus, , In:.

We discuss the case of We the People, a US national experiment in the use of social media technology to enable users to propose and solicit support for policy suggestions to the White House. We apply Baumgartner and Jones's work on agenda setting and punctuated equilibrium, which suggests that policy issues may lie dormant for periods of time until some event triggers attention from the media, interest groups, and elected representatives. In the case study presented, we focus on 21 petitions initiated during the week after the Sandy Hook shooting (14–21 December 2012) in opposition to gun control or in support of policy proposals that are alternatives to gun control, which we view as mobilized efforts to maintain stability and equilibrium in a policy system threatening to change. Using market basket analysis and social network analysis we found a core group of petitions in the “support law-abiding gun owners” theme that were highly connected and four “communities” of e-petitioners mobilizing in opposition to change in gun control policies and in favor of alternative proposals. © The Author(s) 2015.",agenda setting; collective action; community detection; e-petition; Electronic petitioning; market basket analysis; national policy; slacktivism; social network analysis,,,,,,"University at Albany, UAlbany

At the same time, access to these methods is uneven, with corporations and governments tending to have best access to relevant data and analytics tools. Critics raise a number of concerns about the implications dominant uses of data mining and analytics may have for the public: they result in less privacy, more surveillance and social discrimination, and they provide new ways of controlling how publics come to be represented and so understood. In this paper, we consider if a different relationship between the public and data mining might be established, one in which publics might be said to have greater agency and reflexivity vis-à-vis data power. Drawing on growing calls for alternative data regimes and practices, we argue that to enable this different relationship, data mining and analytics need to be democratised in three ways: they should be subject to greater public supervision and regulation, available and accessible to all, and used to create not simply known but reflexive, active and knowing publics. We therefore imagine conditions in which data mining is not just used as a way to know publics, but can become a means for publics to know themselves. © The Author(s) 2015.",agency; calculated publics; data mining; knowing publics; publics; Social media data mining,,,,,,,,,"Andrejevic, M., (2013) Infoglut: How too Much Information is Changing the Way We Think and Know, , New York, NY, Routledge; Andrejevic, M., The work that affective economics does (2011) Cultural Studies, 25 (4-5), pp. 604-620; Andrejevic, M., Gates, K., Big Data surveillance: Introduction (2014) Surveillance and Society, 12 (2), pp. 185-196; 10 largest databases of the world (2012) Realitypod.Com, , http://realitypod.com/2012/03/10-largest-databases-of-the-world/, accessed 16 October 2014; Anstead, N., O'loughlin, B., (2012) Semantic Polling: The Ethics of Online Public Opinion, , http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/46944/1/LSEMPPBrief5.pdf, (accessed 27 April 2013); Anstead, N., O'Loughlin, B., Social media analysis and public opinion: The 2010 UK general election (2015) Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication, 20 (2), pp. 204-220; Baack, S., Datafication and empowerment: How the open data movement re-articulates notions of democracy, participation and journalism (2015) Big Data and Society.

It is important that debates about data power recognise that data is also generated, collected and analysed by alternative actors, enhancing rather than undermining the agency of the public. Developing this argument, we first make clear why and how the question of agency should be central to our engagement with data. Subsequently, we discuss how this question has been operationalized in the five contributions to this special issue, which empirically open up the study of alternative forms of datafication. Building on these contributions, we conclude that as data acquire new power, it is vital to explore the space for citizen agency in relation to data structures and to examine the practices of data work, as well as the people involved in these practices. © The Author(s) 2015.",agency; citizenship; Data; data work; datafication; power,,,,,,,,,"Adam, A., Kreps, D., Enabling or disabling technologies?

The techniques for aggregating user data in the age of pervasive and ubiquitous personal media (e.g. laptops, smartphones, credit cards/swipe cards and radio-frequency identification) build on large aggregates of information (Big Data) analysed by algorithms that transform data into commodities. While the former technologies were built on socio-economic variables such as age, gender, ethnicity, education, media preferences (i.e. categories recognisable to media users and industry representatives alike), Big Data technologies register consumer choice, geographical position, web movement, and behavioural information in technologically complex ways that for most lay people are too abstract to appreciate the full consequences of. The data mined for pattern recognition privileges relational rather than demographic qualities. We argue that the agency of interpretation at the bottom of market decisions within media companies nevertheless introduces a ‘heuristics of the algorithm’, where the data inevitably becomes translated into social categories. In the paper we argue that although the promise of algorithmically generated data is often implemented in automated systems where human agency gets increasingly distanced from the data collected (it is our technological gadgets that are being surveyed, rather than us as social beings), one can observe a felt need among media users and among industry actors to ‘translate back’ the algorithmically produced relational statistics into ‘traditional’ social parameters. The tenacious social structures within the advertising industries work against the techno-economically driven tendencies within the Big Data economy. © The Author(s) 2015.",algorithms; Big Data; digital media; media industries; media use; surveillance,,,,,,,,,"Anderson, C., (2006) The Long Tail: Why the Future of Business is Selling Less of More, , New York, NY, Hyperion; Andersson Schwarz, J., (2013) Online File Sharing: Innovations in Media Consumption, , London, Routledge; Andersson Schwarz, J., Public service broadcasting and data-driven personalization: A view from Sweden.

We argue that content analysis, from its beginning, has been concerned with extracting the main meanings of a text and mapping those meanings onto the space of a textual corpus. In contrast, we suggest that the emergence of new styles of text mining tools is creating an opportunity to develop a different kind of content analysis that we describe as a computational hermeneutics. Here the goal is to go beyond a mapping of the main meaning of a text to mimic the kinds of questions and concerns that have traditionally been the focus of a hermeneutically grounded close reading, a reading that focuses on what Kenneth Burke described as the poetic meanings of a text. We illustrate this approach by referring to our own work concerning the rhetorical character of US National Security Strategy documents. © The Author(s) 2015.",Big Data; close reading; content analysis; Hermeneutics; Kenneth Burke; National Security,,,,,,,,,"Alker, H.R., Lehnert, W.G., Schneider, D.K., Two reinterpretations of Toynbee’s Jesus: Explorations in computational hermeneutics (1985) Artificial Intelligence and Text Understanding, 6, pp. 49-94. , Tonfoni G, Quaderni di Ricerca Linguistica; Abbott, A., Hrycak, A., Measuring resemblance in sequence data: An optimal matching analysis of musicians’ careers (1990) American Journal of Sociology, 96, pp. 144-185; Axelrod, R., (1976) Structure of Decision: The Cognitive Maps of Political Elites, , Princeton, NJ, Princeton University Press; Bearman, P., Stovel, K., Becoming a Nazi: A model for narrative networks (2000) Poetics, 27, pp. 69-90; Berelson, B., (1952) Content Analysis in Communication Research, , New York, NY, Free Press; Blei, D.M., (2011) Introduction to Probabilistic Topic Models, , Princeton, NJ, Princeton University; Blei, D.M., Topic modeling and digital humanities (2012) Journal of Digital Humanities, 2 (1), pp. 8-11; Blei, D.M., Ng, A.Y., Jordan, M.I., Latent dirichlet allocation (2003) Journal of Machine Learning Research, 3, pp. 993-1022; Bourdieu, P., (2004) Science of Science and Reflexivity, , Chicago, University of Chicago Press; Breiger, R.L., A tool kit for practice theory (2000) Poetics, 27 (2-3), pp. 91-115; Burke, K., (1941) The Philosophy of Literary Form, , Berkeley, University of California Press; Burke, K., (1945) A Grammar of Motives, , Berkeley, University of California Press; Carley, K.M., Extracting culture through textual analysis (1994) Poetics, 22, pp. 291-312; Cerulo, K., Analyzing cultural products: A new method of measurement (1988) Social Science Research, 17; Ennis, J.G., The social organization of sociological knowledge: Modeling the intersection of specialties (1992) American Sociological Review, 57, pp. 259-265; Franzosi, R., From words to numbers: A generalized and linguistics-based coding procedure for collecting textual data (1989) Sociological Methodology, 19, pp. 263-298; Franzosi, R., Computer-assisted coding of textual data: An application to semantic grammars (1990) Sociological Methods and Research, 19 (2), pp. 225-257; Gerbner, G., Holsti, O.R., Krippendorff, K., (1969) The Analysis of Communication Content: Developments in Scientific Theories and Computer Techniques, , New York, John Wiley and Sons; Gold, M.K., (2012) Debates in the Digital Humanities, , Minneapolis, University of Minnesotta Press; Goldstone, A., Underwood, T., What can topic models of PMLA teach us about the history of literary scholarship?

I identify four aspects of this problem: the extent to which findings from studies of Facebook and other Big-Data platforms apply to human behavior at the scale of church suppers and department politics where we spend much of our lives; the extent to which the mathematics of scaling might be consistent with behavioral principles, moving beyond a “universal” theory of networks to the study of variation within and between networks; and how a large social field, including its history and culture, shapes the typical representations, interactions, and strategies at local levels in a text or social network. © The Author(s) 2015.",cultural templates; scaling down; Scaling up; scope conditions; situated networks,,,,,,,,,"Blei, D.M., Probabilistic topic models (2012) Communications of the ACM, 55 (4), pp. 77-84; Breiger, R.L., Carley, K.M., Pattison, P.E., Workshop summary (2003) Dynamic Social Network Modeling and Analysis: Workshop Summary and Papers, pp. 3-14. , http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=10735, Breiger R.L., Carley K.M., Pattison P.E., (eds), Washington, DC, National Academies Press, :, In:, (eds; Eliasoph, N., Lichterman, P., Culture in interaction (2003) American Journal of Sociology, 108 (4), pp. 735-794; Festinger, L., Informal social communication (1950) Psychological Review, 57 (5), pp. 271-282; Festinger, L., A theory of social comparison processes (1954) Human Relations, 7, pp. 117-140; George, A.L., Bennett, A., (2005) Case Studies and Theory Development in the Social Sciences, , Cambridge, MA, MIT Press; Goel, V., (2014) Facebook tinkers with users’ emotions in news feed experiment, stirring outcry, , New York Times; Goertz, G., Mahoney, J., (2012) A Tale of Two Cultures: Qualitative and Quantitative Research in the Social Sciences, , Princeton, NJ, Princeton University Press; Golder, S.A., Macy, M.W., Digital footprints: Opportunities and challenges for online social research (2014) Annual Review of Sociology, 40 (1), pp. 129-152; Kashtan, N., Itzkovitz, S., Milo, R., Alon, U., Topological generalizations of network motifs (2004) Physical Review E, 70 (3), p. 031909; Kramer, A.D.I., Guillory, J.E., Hancock, J.T., Experimental evidence of massive-scale emotional contagion through social networks (2014) Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences United States of America, 111 (24), pp. 8788-8790; Lazega, E., Jourda, M.-T., Mounier, L., Stofer, R., Catching up with big fish in the big pond?

While critical scholars have drawn attention to the social, political and legal challenges to these practices, the debates in computer and information science have received less analytical attention. This paper proposes to take seriously the critical knowledge developed in information and computer science and reinterpret their debates to develop a critical intervention into the public controversies concerning data-driven security and digital surveillance. The paper offers a two-pronged contribution: on the one hand, we challenge the credibility of security professionals’ discourses in light of the knowledge that they supposedly mobilize; on the other, we argue for a series of conceptual moves around data, human–computer relations, and algorithms to address some of the limitations of existing engagements with the Big Data-security assemblage. © The Author(s) 2015.",assemblage; Big Data; critique computing and information science; security; surveillance,,,,,,,,,"Abelson, H., Appel, A.W., Bellovin, S.M., (2014) Amici Curiae Brief of Experts in Computer and Data Science in Support of Appellants and Reversal, , https://www.eff.org/files/2014/03/13/clapper_amicus_computer_scientists.pdf, 3 March., (accessed 20 July 2015); ACLU v Clapper (2013) 13 Civ. 3994 US SDNY, , http://www.nysd.uscourts.gov/cases/show.php?db=special&id=364, 27 December 2013, accessed 20 November 2014; (2015), http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov/decisions/isysquery/773a98db-d41d-4db8-95aa-182f994923b5/1/doc/14-42_complete_opn.pdf, N0 14-42 US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit (7 May 2015, accessed 7 May 2015; Alavi, M., Leidner, D.E., Review: Knowledge management and knowledge management systems: Conceptual foundations and research issues (2001) MIS Quarterly, 25 (1), pp. 107-136; Allen, J., Powerful assemblages?

In the field of text analysis, several such differences are noted: social scientists often use unsupervised models to explore corpora, whereas many computer scientists employ supervised models to train data; social scientists hold to more conventional causal notions than do most computer scientists, and often favor intense exploitation of existing algorithms, whereas computer scientists focus more on developing new models; and computer scientists tend to trust human judgment more than social scientists do. These differences have implications that potentially can improve the practice of social science. © The Author(s) 2015.",interpretation; sentiment analysis; supervised models; text analysis; Topic models; unsupervised models,,,,,,,,,"Almeydin, E., (2014) Introduction to Machine Learning, , 3rd ed, Cambridge, MA, MIT Press; Barocas, S., Selbst, A., Big data’s disparate impact (2016) California Law Review, 104. , http://ssrn.com/abstract=2477899; Blei, D.M., Probabilistic topic models (2012) Communications of the ACM, 55, pp. 77-84; Blei, D.M., Ng, A.Y., Jordan, M.I., Latent Dirichlet allocation (2003) Journal of Machine Learning Research, 3, pp. 993-1022; Boyd-Graber, J., Mimno, D., Newman, D., Care and feeding of topic models: Problems, diagnostics and improvements (2014) Handbook of Mixed Membership Models and their Applications, pp. 3-41. , Airoldi E., Blei D., Erosheva E., (eds), Boca Raton, FL, CRC Press, In:, (eds; Chang, J., Boyd-Graber, J., Gerrish, S., Reading tea leaves: How humans interpret topic models (2009) In:Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 1 (NIPS-09), pp. 288-296. , Vancouver, Canada, NIPS; DiMaggio, P., Nag, M., Blei, D.M., Exploiting affinities between topic models and the sociological perspective on culture: Applications to newspaper coverage of U.S. government arts funding (2013) Poetics, 41, pp. 570-606; Gilbert, D.T., How mental systems believe (1991) American Psychologist, 46, pp. 107-119; Graham, J., Haidt, J., Nosek, B.A., Liberals and conservatives rely on different sets of moral foundations (2009) Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 96, pp. 1029-1046; Grimmer, J., Stewart, B., Text as data: The promise and pitfalls of automatic content analysis methods for political texts (2013) Political Analysis, 23, pp. 1-31; Hammond, K.R., (2000) Judgments Under Stress, , New York, NY, Oxford University Press; Hardin, C., Banaji, M.R., The nature of implicit prejudice (2013) The Behavioral Foundations of Public Policy, pp. 13-31. , Shafir E., (ed), Princeton, CA, Princeton University Press, In:, (ed; Inouye, D.I., Ravikumar, P., Dhillion, I.S., Admixture of Poisson MRFs: A topic model with word dependencies.

Both the gender-specific dynamics surrounding what counts as “notability” on the online encyclopedia and Wikipedia's relative categorical incoherence are discussed.

The challenge that Big Data techniques pose to the social scientist, I think, is of a different nature. Big Data on social actors mainly record events, e.g. interactions between human beings that happen at a point in time. In contrast, social network analysts tend to think in terms of social relations that exist over a timespan. The challenge, then, is to rethink our conceptions and models of social relations and social structure. I conceptualize social structure and social relations as forces. I propose modelling these forces with regression models for longitudinal interaction data. © The Author(s) 2015.",agency; Network analysis; regression models; relational events; sociality,,,,,,,,,"Bourdieu, P., (1993) The Field of Cultural Production.

Using an example drawn from work on Victorian novelist Anthony Trollope's Barsetshire series, it argues that unsupervised topic modeling's counter-factual and retrospective reconstruction of the topics out of which a given set of novels have been created allows for a denaturalizing and unfamiliar (though crucially not “objective” or “unbiased”) view. In other words, topic models are fictions, and scholars of literature should consider reading them as such. Drawing on one aspect of Stephen Ramsay's idea of algorithmic criticism, the essay emphasizes the continuities between “big data” methods and techniques and longer-standing methods of literary study. © The Author(s) 2015.",distant reading; literary criticism; literature; machine learning; novels; Topic modeling,,,,,,,"Valuable conversations about and feedback on the ideas in this paper came from Laura Heffernan, David Mimno, Michael Reay, the members of the Swarthmore College Victorian Novel Research Seminar, particularly Allison Shultes, and the members of the Tri-College Digital Humanities Art of Topic Modeling Seminar.",,"Bamman, D., Underwood, T., Smith, N., A Bayesian mixed effects model of literary character (2014) Proceedings from the 52Nd Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL 2014), , http://acl2014.org/acl2014/P14-1/pdf/P14-1035.pdf, Baltimore, Maryland, USA,, June.

InformaCam allows one to manage and delete metadata from images and videos in order to diminish surveillance risks related to online tracking. Furthermore, it structures and stores the metadata in such a way that the documentary material becomes better accommodated to evidentiary settings, if needed. In this paper I propose InformaCam should be interpreted as a ‘forensic device’. By using the conceptualization of forensics and work on socio-technical devices the paper discusses how InformaCam, through a range of interventions, rearranges metadata into a technology of evidence. InformaCam explicitly recognizes mobile phones as context aware, uses their sensors, and structures metadata in order to facilitate data analysis after images are captured. Through these modifications it invents a form of ‘sensory data forensics'. By treating data in this particular way, surveillance resistance does more than seeking awareness. It becomes engaged with investigatory practices. Considering the extent by which states conduct metadata surveillance, the project can be seen as a timely response to the unequal distribution of power over data. © The Author(s) 2015.",activism; apps; Forensics; metadata; mobile devices; surveillance,,,,,,,"I would like to thank Susan Schuppli, Shela Sheikh and Sam Gregory for their comments to a previous version of this paper, Niels ten Oever, Tamira Combrink and the anonymous reviewers for their critical remarks, and the developers of the project, Harlo Holmes and Nathan Freitas for taking time to correspond with me about their work.",,"Barry, A., Demonstrations: Sites and sights of direct action (1999) Economy and Society, 28 (1), pp. 75-94; Callon, M., Europe wrestling with technology (2004) Economy and Society, 33 (1), pp. 121-134; Callon, M., Muniesa, F., Peripheral vision economic markets as calculative collective devices (2005) Organization Studies, 26 (8), pp. 1229-1250; Human Rights Electronic Evidence Study: Final Report.

This paper presents an analysis of eight projects that are experimenting with the use of these methods for various purposes. It shows that two specific technological features influence the work with such methods in all the cases. The first concerns the need to distribute choices about the structure of data to third-party actors and the second concerns the need to balance machine intelligence and human intuition when automating the analysis. These features set specific conditions for knowledge production, and the paper identifies two opposite approaches for engaging with each of these conditions.

These data sets are often “found data” arising from purely observational sources rather than data derived under strict rules of a statistically designed experiment. However, since these large data sets easily meet the sample size requirements of most statistical procedures, they give analysts a false sense of security as they proceed to focus on employing traditional statistical methods. We explain how most analyses performed on Big Data today lead to “precisely inaccurate” results that hide biases in the data but are easily overlooked due to the enhanced significance of the results created by the data size. Before any analyses are performed on large data sets, we recommend employing a simple data segmentation technique to control for some major components of observational data biases. These segments will help to improve the accuracy of the results. © The Author(s) 2015.",bias; Big Data; inaccuracy; segmentation; sociology; statistics,,,,,,,,,"Birant, D., (2011) Data Mining Using RFM Analysis, , INTECH Open Access Publisher; Blattberg, R.C., Kim, B.-D., Neslin, S.A., (2008) Database Marketing: Analyzing and Managing Customers, pp. 323-338. , Chapter 12.

This paper does just that, repurposing Lippmann’s argument in the context of the ongoing debate over the role of the digital citizen in Big Data management. It is argued that proposals by the Federal Trade Commission, the White House and the US Congress, championing failed notice and choice privacy policy, perpetuate a self-governance fallacy comparable to Lippmann’s, referred to here as the fallacy of data privacy self-management. Even if the digital citizen had the faculties and the system for data privacy self-management, the digital citizen has little time for data governance. We desire the freedom to pursue the ends of digital production, without being inhibited by the means. We want privacy, and safety, but cannot complete all that is required for its protection. If it is true that the fallacy of democracy is similar to the fallacy of data privacy self-management, then perhaps the pragmatic solution is representative data management: a combination of non/for-profit digital dossier management via infomediaries that can ensure the protection of personal data, while freeing individuals from what Lippmann referred to as an ‘unattainable ideal.’ © The Author(s) 2015.",Big Data; data management; data privacy self-management; information policy; privacy,,,,,,,,,"Acquisti, A., Gross, R., Stutzman, F., Face recognition and privacy in the age of augmented reality (2014) Journal of Privacy and Confidentiality, 6 (2), pp. 1-20; Bamford, J., The black box: Inside America’s massive new surveillance center (2012) Wired.Co.Uk, , www.wired.co.uk/magazine/archive/2012/05/features/the-black-box, 30 March, accessed 18 December 2014; Ben-Shahar, O., Schneider, C.E., The failure of mandated disclosure (2011) University of Pennsylvania Law Review, 1593, pp. 647-749; Burn-Murdoch, J., Critics of big data have overlooked the speed factor (2013) The Guardian, , http://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2013/may/20/big-data-critics-overlooked-speed-not-size, (accessed 5 August 2015); Cardozo, N., Cohn, C., Higgins, P., (2014) Who has Your Back?

Looking in detail at the technical characteristics, conventions, and peculiarities of Facebook’s architecture and data interface, we argue that such technical fieldwork is essential to data-driven research, both as a crucial form of data critique and as a way to identify analytical opportunities. Using the “We are all Khaled Said” Facebook Page, which hosted the activities of nearly 1.9 million users during the Egyptian Revolution and beyond, as empirical example, we show how Facebook’s API raises important questions about data detail, completeness, consistency over time, and architectural complexity. We then outline an exploratory approach and a number of analytical techniques that take the API and its idiosyncrasies as a starting point for the concrete investigation of a large dataset. Our goal is to close the gap between Big Data research and research about Big Data by showing that the critical investigation of technicity is essential for empirical research and that attention to the particularities of empirical work can provide a deeper understanding of the various issues Big Data research is entangled with. © The Author(s) 2015.",Application Programming Interface-based research; data critique; exploratory data analysis; Facebook Pages,,,,,,,,,"Abdulla, R., (2014) Egypt’s Media in the Midst of Revolution, , Report, Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, USA, July; Agre, P.E., Surveillance and capture: Two models of privacy (1994) The Information Society: An International Journal, 10 (2), pp. 101-127; Alam, S.L., Walker, D., The public Facebook: A case of Australian Government Facebook Pages and participation (2011) ACIS 2011 Proceedings, Sydney, Australia, 30 November–2 December.

More specifically, the article focuses upon the role of data in the production and playing of football, with the suggestion that forms of measurement and pattern recognition are now central to the performance of footballers and the recruitment and organization of squads. The article reflects on what this case study reveals about the implications of data, metrics and analytics for contemporary culture and suggests that we can use examples like football to see how embedded these data-processes are in the social world.

According to the evangelists of “data science,” all of these are instruments for observing reality at unprecedentedly large scales and fine granularities. This perspective ignores the social reality of these very different technological systems, ignoring how they are made, how they work, and what they mean in favor of an exclusive focus on what they generate: Big Data. But no data, big or small, can be interpreted without an understanding of the process that generated them. Statistical data science is applicable to systems that have been designed as scientific instruments, but is likely to lead to confusion when applied to systems that have not.

Big Data coupled with powerful computing has the potential to replace the statistical practice of sampling and estimating effects by measuring phenomena based on full populations. Preparing these data for analysis and conducting analytics involves a plethora of decisions, some of which are already embedded in previously collected data and built tools. These decisions refer to the recording, indexing and representation of data and the settings for analysis methods. While these choices can have tremendous impact on research outcomes, they are not often obvious, not considered or not being made explicit. Consequently, our awareness and understanding of the impact of these decisions on analysis results and derived implications are highly underdeveloped. This might be attributable to occasional high levels of over-confidence in computational solutions as well as the possible yet questionable assumption that Big Data can wash out minor data quality issues, among other reasons. This article provides examples for how to address this issue. It argues that checking, ensuring and validating the quality of big social data and related auxiliary material is a key ingredient for empowering users to gain reliable insights from their work. Scrutinizing data for accuracy issues, systematically fixing them and diligently documenting these processes can have another positive side effect: Closely interacting with the data, thereby forcing ourselves to understand their idiosyncrasies and patterns, can help us to move from being able to precisely model and formally describe effects in society to also understand and explain them. © The Author(s) 2015.",data mining; data preprocessing; error analysis; evaluation; social network analysis; Validation,,,,,,"University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, UIUC","I thank Craig Evans and Jinseok Kim, both from UIUC, for their substantial contributions to the referred research.",,"Abello, J., Broadwell, P., Tangherlini, T.R., Computational folkloristics (2012) Communications of the ACM, 55 (7), pp. 60-70; Backstrom, L., Boldi, P., Rosa, M., Four degrees of separation (2012) Proceedings of the 4Th ACM Web Science Conference (WebSci’12), pp. 33-42. , Evanston, IL, ACM; Cragin, M.H., Palmer, C.L., Carlson, J.R., Data sharing, small science and institutional repositories (2010) Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society A: Mathematical, Physical and Engineering Sciences, 368 (1926), pp. 4023-4038; de Choudhury, M., Mason, W.A., Hofman, J.M., Inferring relevant social networks from interpersonal communication (2010) Proceedings of the 19Th International Conference on the World Wide Web (WWW’10), pp. 301-310. , Raleigh, NC: ACM; Diesner, J., From texts to networks: detecting and managing the impact of methodological choices for extracting network data from text data (2013) Künstliche Intelligenz/Artificial Intelligence, 27 (1), pp. 75-78; Diesner, J., Words and networks: How reliable are network data constructed from text data?

Focusing on the expansive architecture, location, and resource dependence of the NSA’s Utah Data Center, I demonstrate how surveillance and privacy can never be disconnected from the material infrastructures that allow and render natural the epistemological state of mass surveillance. Specifically, I explore the NSA’s infrastructure and the million of gallons of water it requires daily to cool its servers, while located in one of the driest states in the US. Complicating surveillance beyond the NSA, as also already imbricated with various social media companies, this article questions the emplacement and impact of corporate data centers more generally, and the changes they are causing to the landscape and local economies. I look at how water is an intriguing and politically relevant part of the surveillance infrastructure and how it has been constructed as the main tool for activism in this case, and how it may eventually help transform the public’s conceptualization of Big Data, as deeply material. © The Author(s) 2015.",activism; data; new materialism; NSA; Surveillance; water,,,,,,,,,"Aid, M.M., (2009) The Secret Sentry: The Untold History of the National Security Agency, , 1st ed, New York, Bloomsbury Press; Andrejevic, M., (2013) Infoglut: How Too Much Information Is Changing the Way We Think and Know, , New York and London, Routledge; Andrejevic, M., Gates, K., Big data surveillance: Introduction (2014) Surveillance & Society, 12 (2), pp. 185-196; Bamford, J., (2012) The NSA is Building the country’s Biggest Spy Center (Watch What You Say), , www.wired.com/2012/03/ff_nsadatacenter/all/, accessed 16 June 2015; Bamford, J., (2012) NSA Utah Data Center largest spy compound ever—Part 2: VirtualThreat, , www.virtualthreat.com/2012/06/02/nsa-utah-data-center-largest-spy-compound-ever-part-2, 2014, (accessed 26 November 2014); Bamford, J., The most wanted man in the world: Edward Snowden in his own words (2014) WIRED, , www.wired.com/2014/08/edward-snowden/, accessed 26 November 2014; Bennett, J., The agency of assemblages and the North American blackout (2005) Public Culture, 17 (3), pp. 445-466. , (reprinted in Political Theologies: Public Religions in a Post-Secular World, eds.

In this commentary we further debate over the use of large-scale survey data and official statistics with ‘Big Data’ methodologists, and emphasise the ability of these resources to incorporate the essential social and cultural heredity that is intrinsic to the human sciences. In doing so, we introduce a series of new data-sets that integrate approximately 30 years of survey data on victimisation, fear of crime and disorder and social attitudes with indicators of socio-economic conditions and policy outcomes in Britain. The data-sets that we outline below do not conform to typical conceptions of ‘Big Data’. But, we would contend, they are ‘big’ in terms of the volume, variety and complexity of data which has been collated (and to which additional data can be linked) and ‘big’ also in that they allow us to explore key questions pertaining to how social and economic policy change at the national level alters the attitudes and experiences of citizens. Importantly, they are also ‘small’ in the sense that the task of rendering the data usable, linking it and decoding it, required both manual processing and tacit knowledge of the context of the data and intentions of its creators. © The Author(s) 2015.",Crime; secondary data analyses; social and political change; surveys; Thatcherism; victimisation,,,,,,,,,"Bartle, J., Dellepiane-Avellaneda, S., Stimson, J.A., The moving centre: Preferences for government activity in Britain, 1950–2005 (2011) British Journal of Political Science, 41 (2), pp. 259-285; Berridge, D., Brodie, I., Pitts, J., (2001) The Independent Effects of Permanent Exclusion from School on the Offending Careers of Young People RDS Occasional Paper No. 71, , London, Home Office; Bolling, K., Clemens, S., Grant, C., (2004) 2003–04 British Crime Survey (England and Wales): Technical report, , London, BMRB; Burrows, R., Savage, M., After the crisis?

Until recently, social scientists were forced to conduct post-hoc case studies of such unusual events that ignore the broader universe of possible shifts in public opinion that do not materialize. The vast amount of data that has recently become available via social media sites such as Facebook and Twitter—as well as the mass-digitization of qualitative archives provide an unprecedented opportunity for scholars to avoid such selection on the dependent variable. Yet the sheer scale of these new data creates a new set of methodological challenges. Conventional linear models, for example, minimize the influence of rare events as “outliers”—especially within analyses of large samples. While more advanced regression models exist to analyze outliers, they suffer from an even more daunting challenge: equifinality, or the likelihood that rare events may occur via different causal pathways. I discuss a variety of possible solutions to these problems—including recent advances in fuzzy set theory and machine learning—but ultimately advocate an ecumenical approach that combines multiple techniques in iterative fashion. © The Author(s) 2015.",automated text analysis; causal complexity; cultural sociology; machine learning; rare events; Social media,,,,,,,"I am grateful to Ron Breiger, Taylor Brown, John Mohr, and Robin Wagner-Pacifici for comments upon previous drafts of this manuscript.",,"Bail, C., The fringe effect: Civil society organizations and the evolution of media discourse about Islam, 2001–2008 (2012) American Sociological Review, 77 (7), pp. 855-879; Bail, C., Taming Big Data: Using app technology to study organizational behavior on social media (2015) Sociological Methods & Research; Benford, R., An insider’s critique of the social movement framing perspective (1997) Sociological Inquiry, 67 (4), pp. 409-430; Breiman, L., Random forests (2001) Machine Learning, 45 (1), pp. 5-32; Chang, J., Boyd-Graber, J., Gerrish, S., Advances in neural information processing systems (2009) Reading Tea Leaves: How Humans Interpret Topic Models, pp. 296-299; Collins, R., Social movements and the focus of emotional attention (2001) Passionate Politics: Emotions and Social Movements, pp. 27-46. , Goodwin J., Jasper J., Polletta F., (eds), Chicago, University of Chicago Press, In:, (eds; Giugni, M., Was it worth the effort?

Literature drawn from the smart cities discourse and from a UK research project into hyperlocal media, respectively, take on these two opposing interpretations. Evidence gathered in the case study presented here is consistent with the latter, and on this basis we criticise the notion that hyperlocal social media can be seen as a community in itself. We demonstrate this by creating a network map of Twitter followers of a popular hyperlocal blog in Brockley, southeast London. We describe various attributes of this network including its average degree and clustering coefficient to suggest that a small and highly connected cluster of visible local entities such as businesses form a clique at the centre of this network, with individual residents following these but not one another. We then plot the locations of these entities and demonstrate that sub-communities in the network are formed due to close geographical proximity between smaller sets of businesses. These observations are illustrated with qualitative evidence from interviews with users who suggest instead that rather than being connected to one another they benefit from what has been described as ‘neighbourhood storytelling’. Despite the limitations of working with Twitter data, we propose that this multi-modal approach offers a valuable way to investigate the experience of using social media as a communication tool in urban neighbourhoods. © The Author(s) 2015.",community; digital geography; Hyperlocal media; neighbourhoods; social media; urban,,,,,,,"This work has been made possible by the cooperation of Brockley Central's users and its creator Nick Barron, who has given permission for his name to be used in relation to this research.

However, there is reason to believe this is changing as organizational theory scholars are beginning to embrace new methods and data sources. In this essay, I present a view that suggests there are several latent opportunities, many of which have been simmering unattended for some time. This research approach is not without its challenges, as the ontological terrain of Big Data is untested and potentially disruptive. However, we are observing a renewal of approaches to text and content analysis. By opening up the toolkit of computational linguistics methods for text analysis, Big Data may bring about fresh synthesis and reshape classic debates around social structure. © The Author(s) 2015.",Big Data;

Here we explore the growing usage and centrality of mobiles in the lives of young people, questioning what data-making possibilities exist if users can either uncover and/or capture what data controllers such as Facebook monetize and share about themselves with third-parties. We outline the MobileMiner, an app we created to consider how gaining access to one’s own data not only augments the agency of the individual but of the collective user. Finally, we discuss the data making that transpired during our hackathon.

What we badly need instead is a conversation about the substantive innovations that have made statistical modeling useful for disciplines where, in the past, it truly wasn’t. These innovations are partly technical, but more fundamentally expressed in what Leo Breiman calls a new “culture” of statistical modeling. Where 20th-century methods often required humanists to squeeze our unstructured texts, sounds, or images into some special-purpose data model, new methods can handle unstructured evidence more directly by modeling it in a high-dimensional space. This opens a range of research opportunities that humanists have barely begun to discuss. To date, topic modeling has received most attention, but in the long run, supervised predictive models may be even more important. I sketch their potential by describing how Jordan Sellers and I have begun to model poetic distinction in the long 19th century—revealing an arc of gradual change much longer than received literary histories would lead us to expect. © The Author(s) 2015.",bag of words; Literary distinction; literary theory; machine learning; poetic diction; predictive modeling,,,,,,,,,"Abbott, A., Things of boundaries (1995) Social Research, 62 (4), pp. 857-882; Breiman, L., Statistical modeling: The two cultures (2001) Statistical Science, 16 (3), pp. 199-231; DiMaggio, P., Nag, M., Blei, D., Exploiting affinities between topic modeling and the sociological perspective on culture: Application to newspaper coverage of U.S. government arts funding (2013) Poetics, 41 (6), pp. 570-606; Goldstone, A., Underwood, T., The quiet transformations of literary studies: What thirteen thousand scholars could tell us (2014) New Literary History, 45 (3), pp. 359-384; Greenblatt, S., Abrams, M.H., Christ, C., (2006) Norton Anthology of English Literature, , 8th ed, 2.

Various commercial, governmental and civil society organizations now envisage education as a highly coded, software-mediated and data-driven social institution. Such spaces are to be governed through computational processes written in computer code and tracked through big data. In an original analysis of developments from commercial, governmental and civil society sectors, the article examines two interrelated dimensions of an emerging smart schools imaginary: (1) the constant flows of digital data that smart schools depend on and the mobilization of analytics that enable student data to be used to anticipate and shape their behaviours; and (2) the ways that young people are educated to become ‘computational operatives’ who must ‘learn to code’ in order to become ‘smart citizens’ in the governance of the smart city. These developments constitute an emerging educational space fabricated from intersecting standards, technologies, discourses and social actors, all infused with the aspirations of technical experts to govern the city at a distance through both monitoring young people as ‘data objects’ and schooling them as active ‘computational citizens’ with the responsibility to compute the future of the city. © The Author(s) 2015.",Citizens; code; computational urbanism; data; governance; smart city; sociotechnical imaginary,,,,,,,,,"Batty, M., (2013) The New Science of Cities, , London, MIT Press; Beer, B., (2015) Productive Measures: Culture and Measurement in the Context of Everyday Neoliberalism.

In this article, we situate one branch of Big Data analytics, spatial Big Data, through a historical predecessor, geodemographic analysis, to help develop a critical approach to current data analytics. Spatial Big Data promises an epistemic break in marketing, a leap from targeting geodemographic areas to targeting individuals. Yet it inherits characteristics and problems from geodemographics, including a justification through the market, and a process of commodification through the black-boxing of technology. As researchers develop sustained critiques of data analytics and its effects on everyday life, we must so with a grounding in the cultural and historical contexts from which data technologies emerged. This article and others (Barnes and Wilson, 2014) develop a historically situated, critical approach to spatial Big Data. This history illustrates connections to the critical issues of surveillance, redlining, and the production of consumer subjects and geographies.

The nodes are formed by noun phrases and links by verbs, directly expressing the action of one node upon the other. This network is studied by applying insights from several theories and techniques, and by combining existing tools in an innovative way, including: graph partitioning, centrality, assortativity, hierarchy and structural balance. The analysis yields various patterns. First, we observe that the fundamental split between the Republican and Democrat camps can be easily detected by network partitioning, which provides a strong validation check of the approach adopted, as well as a sound way to assign actors and topics to one of the two camps. Second, we identify the most central nodes of the political camps. We also learnt that Clinton played a more central role than Biden in the Democrat camp; the overall campaign was much focused on economy and rights; the Republican Party (Grand Old Party or GOP) is the most divisive subject in the campaign, and is portrayed more negatively than the Democrats; and, overall, the media reported positive statements more frequently for the Democrats than the Republicans.

Platforms like Facebook, Twitter, Google+ and LinkedIn have profoundly changed how we communicate and interact. They have enabled the establishment of and participation in digital communities as well as the representation, documentation and exploration of social behaviours, and had a disruptive effect on how we use the Internet. Such digital communications present scholars with a novel way to detect, observe, analyse and understand online communities over time. This article presents the formalization of a Social Observatory: a low latency method for the observation and measurement of social indicators within an online community. Our framework facilitates interdisciplinary research methodologies via tools for data acquisition and analysis in inductive and deductive settings. By focusing our Social Observatory on the public Facebook profiles of 187 federal German politicians we illustrate how we can analyse and measure sentiment, public opinion, and information discourse in advance of the federal elections. To this extent, we analysed 54,665 posts and 231,147 comments, creating a composite index of overall public sentiment and the underlying conceptual discussion themes. Our case study demonstrates the observation of communities at various resolutions: “zooming” in on specific subsets or communities as a whole. The results of the case study illustrate the ability to observe published sentiment and public dialogue as well as the difficulties associated with established methods within the field of sentiment analysis within short informal text. © The Author(s) 2015.",computational social science; Facebook; political discourse; sentiment analysis; Social Observatory; text analytics,,,,,,,We would like to thank and acknowledge the work of Lukas Br?ckner (for review purposes) in the preparation and implementation of the Facebook adapter used in this article.,,"Allen, S.M., Chorley, M., Colombo, G., Exploiting user interest similarity and social links for micro-blog forwarding in mobile opportunistic networks (2014) Pervasive and Mobile Computing, 11, pp. 106-131; Atefeh, F., Khreich, W., A survey of techniques for event detection in twitter (2015) Computational Intellegence, 31 (1), pp. 132-164; Baccianella, S., Esuli, A., Sebastiani, F., SentiWordNet 3.0: An enhanced lexical resource for sentiment analysis and opinion mining (2010) Proceedings of the Seventh International Conference on Language Resources and Evaluation (LREC’10), pp. 2200-2204. , Paris, France: European Language Resources Association; Balahur, A., Hermida, J.M., Extending the EmotiNet knowledge base to improve the automatic detection of implicitly expressed emotions from text (2012) Proceedings of the 8Th International Conference on Language Resources and Evaluation, pp. 1207-1214. , Paris, France, European Language Resources Association; Beck, S., The science of personality: Nomothetic or idiographic?

We contribute to this line of inquiry through an investigation of digital humanities (DH) scholars’ uses and gratifications of Twitter. We conducted a thematic analysis of 25 semi-structured interview transcripts to learn about these scholars’ professional use of Twitter. Our findings show that Twitter is considered a critical tool for informal communication within DH invisible colleges, functioning at varying levels as both an information network (learning to ‘Twitter’ and maintaining awareness) and a social network (imagining audiences and engaging other digital humanists). We find that Twitter follow relationships reflect common academic interests and are closely tied to scholars’ pre-existing social ties and conference or event co-attendance. The concept of the invisible college continues to be relevant but requires revisiting. The invisible college formed on Twitter is messy, consisting of overlapping social contexts (professional, personal and public), scholars with different habits of engagement, and both formal and informal ties. Our research illustrates the value of using multiple methods to explore the complex questions arising from Big Data studies and points toward future research that could implement Big Data techniques on a small scale, focusing on sub-topics or emerging fields, to expose the nature of scholars’ invisible colleges made visible on Twitter. © The Author(s) 2015.",Big Data; digital humanities (DH); scholars; social media; social networks; Twitter; Uses and gratifications,,,,,,,,,"Aladwani, A.M., Facilitators, characteristics, and impacts of Twitter use: Theoretical analysis and empirical illustration (2015) International Journal of Information Management, 35 (1), pp. 15-25; Anderson, B., (1983) Imagined Communities: Reflections on the Origin and Spread of Nationalism, , London, Verso; Archambault, A., Grudin, J., A longitudinal study of Facebook, Linkedin, & Twitter use (2012) Proceedings of the 2012 ACM Annual Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems - CHI ’12, p. 2741. , New York, NY: ACM Press, 5–12 May 2012; Barbour, R., Checklists for improving rigour in qualitative research: A case of the tail wagging the dog?

Those who apply these methods may also aspire to augment the arsenal of research methods, offer surrogates for existing research designs, and re-orient research. Moreover, we can critically examine the institutional, societal and political effects of the Big Data methods and the conditions for the solid institutionalization of these methods in social and political research. To reach its primary objective, this article elaborates conclusions on how Big Data methods, not only by means of their ‘social life’ but also by their ‘political life’, may influence the institutionalization of social and political research. To reach its secondary objective, the article re-examines a study of budgetary legislation in 13 countries carried out by means of Big Data methods to draw conclusions concerning the augmentation of the arsenal of research methods, the surrogation of existing research designs, and the re-orientation of research. © The Author(s) 2015.",Digital social research; institutional analysis; institutional change; latent trait scaling; neo-institutionalism; topic modeling,,,,,,,,,"(2006) Art of Rhetoric, , Reprint of 1926 edition, Cambridge, Harvard University Press; Austin, J.L., (1962) How to do Things with Words, 1. , Oxford, Clarendon; (2013) Federal Organic Budget Act of 2013, , http://www.ris.bka.gv.at/Dokumente/Erv/ERV_2009_1_139/ERV_2009_1_139.pdf, Available at:, accessed 15 October 2013; Bail, C.A., The cultural environment: Measuring culture with big data (2014) Theory and Society, 43 (3-4), pp. 465-482; Berger, P.L., Luckmann, T., (1966) The Social Construction of Reality, , Garden City, NJ, Anchor Books; Biernacki, R., Humanist interpretation versus coding text samples (2014) Qualitative Sociology, 37 (2), pp. 173-188; Blei, D.M., Probabilistic topic models (2012) Communications of the ACM, 55 (4), pp. 77-84; Blei, D.M., Build, compute, critique, repeat: Data analysis with latent variable models (2014) Annual Review of Statistics and Its Applications, 1, pp. 203-232; Blei, D.M., Ng, A.Y., Jordan, M.I., Latent Dirichlet allocation (2003) Journal of Machine Learning Research, 2, pp. 993-1022; boyd, D., Crawford, K., Critical questions for big data: Provocations for a cultural, technological, and scholarly phenomenon (2012) Information, Communication & Society, 15 (5), pp. 662-679; Brake, B., Katzenstein, P.J., Lost in translation?

Recognising the impracticality of conducting an audit across all forms and uses of Big Data, we have restricted our enquiry to one very specific form of Big Data, namely general purpose taxonomies, of which Mosaic, Acorn and Origins are examples, that rely on data from a variety of Big Data feeds. The intention of these taxonomies is to enable the records of consumers and citizens held on Big Data datasets to be coded according to type of residential neighbourhood or ethno-cultural heritage without any use of questionnaires. Based on our respective experience in the academic social sciences, in government and in the design and marketing of these taxonomies, we identify the features of these classifications which appear to render them attractive or problematic to different categories of potential user or researcher depending on how the relationship is conceived. We conclude by identifying seven classifications of user or potential user who, on account of their background, current position and future career expectations, tend to respond in different ways to the opportunity to adopt these generic systems as aids for understanding social processes. © The Author(s) 2015.",adoption; ethnicity; origins; social class; social scientists; Taxonomy,,,,,,,,,"Burrows, R., Life in the ‘Alpha Territory’: Investigating London's ‘Super-Rich’ neighbourhoods (2013) LSE Blog, , January; Butler, T., Robson, G., (2003) London Calling: ‘The Middle Classes and the Remaking of Inner London; Cummins, C., Winter, C.K., Maric, R., An assessment of the Nam Pehchan computer program for the identification of names of south Asian ethnic origin (1999) Journal of Public Health Medicine, 21 (4), pp. 401-406; Goodhart, D., (2013) The British Dream: Successes and Failure of Post War Immigration, , London, Atlantic Books; Harris, R., Sleight, P., Webber, R., (2005) Geodemographics, GIS and Neighbourhood Targeting, , Chichester, Wiley; Mouncey, P., (2014), https://www.mrs.org.uk/ijmr_blog_archive/blog/706; Using customer insight to build competitive advantage (2003) White Paper; Phillips, T., (2014) Scotland's Many Subcultures, , Demos Quarterly, July; Savage, M., Burrows, R., The coming crisis of empirical sociology (2007) Sociology, 41 (5), pp. 885-899; Sleight, P., (2004) Targeting Customers: How to Use Geodemographic and Lifestyle Data in Your Business, , Henley on Thames, WARC; Thrift, N., (2005) Knowing Capitalism, , London, Sage; Uprichard, E., Burrows, R., Parker, S., Geodemographic code and the production of space (2009) Environment and Planning A, 41 (12), pp. 2823-2835; Webber, R., (1975) Liverpool Social Area Study, 1971 Data, , PRAG Technical Paper No. 14, Centre for Environmental Studies, London; Webber, R., Designing geodemographic classifications to meet contemporary business needs (2000) Journal of Interactive Marketing, 5 (3), pp. 219-237; Webber, R., How parties used segmentation in the 2005 British General Election Campaign (2006) Journal of Direct, Data and Digital Marketing Practice, 7 (2), pp. 239-252","Webber, R.J.; Kings College LondonUnited Kingdom; email: richardwebber@originsinfo.eu",,,SAGE Publications Ltd,,,,,20539517,,,,English,Big Data Soc.,Article,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84960516726

I try to capture this process with the concept of ‘hacking multitude'. Working on a case study of the Turkish government's block of the social media platform Twitter (March 2014), I argue that during systemic data choke-points, a multitude of users might acquire a certain degree of reflexivity over ubiquitous software of advanced techno-capitalism. Resisting naïve parallels between urban streets and virtual global streets, the article draws on Fuller's ‘media ecologies' to make sense of complex and dynamic interactions between processes and materialities, strategies of communication and mundane practices. Such a dense space is mostly invisible to network and traffic analysis, although it comes alive under the magnifying lens of digital ethnography. As the Turkish government tried to stop protesters on both the urban and the Twitter spheres, alternative material configurations and new hybrid formations and practices emerged. I try to bring this process alive following the traces – that is, a combination of digital data and materialities – of a social space between the protest for Twitter access, the ‘digital coup' and the interactions that this situation determined. In the final section, I briefly explore two research trajectories which can further develop my initial formulation of a ‘hacking multitude'. I argue that a generalisation of hacking/multitude is problematic for the political, cultural or economic processes more directly associated with Big Data. © The Author(s) 2015 Reprints and permissions: sagepub.co.uk/journalsPermissions.nav.",Big Data; digital ethnography; hackers; Internet; multitude; Twitter,,,,,,,,,"Alleyne, B., (2011) We are All Hackers Now: Critical Sociological Reflections on the Hacking Phenomenon, pp. 1-32. , Working Paper; Becker, H., Visual evidence: A seventh man, the specified generalization, and the work of the reader (2002) Visual Studies, (17), pp. 3-11; Beer, D., Power through the algorithm?

And what difference does data quantity make to knowledge production strategies and their outputs? I argue that the novelty of Big Data science does not lie in the sheer quantity of data involved, but rather in (1) the prominence and status acquired by data as commodity and recognised output, both within and outside of the scientific community and (2) the methods, infrastructures, technologies, skills and knowledge developed to handle data. These developments generate the impression that data-intensive research is a new mode of doing science, with its own epistemology and norms. To assess this claim, one needs to consider the ways in which data are actually disseminated and used to generate knowledge. Accordingly, this article reviews the development of sophisticated ways to disseminate, integrate and re-use data acquired on model organisms over the last three decades of work in experimental biology. I focus on online databases as prominent infrastructures set up to organise and interpret such data and examine the wealth and diversity of expertise, resources and conceptual scaffolding that such databases draw upon. This illuminates some of the conditions under which Big Data needs to be curated to support processes of discovery across biological subfields, which in turn highlights the difficulties caused by the lack of adequate curation for the vast majority of data in the life sciences. In closing, I reflect on the difference that data quantity is making to contemporary biology, the methodological and epistemic challenges of identifying and analysing data given these developments, and the opportunities and worries associated with Big Data discourse and methods. © The Author(s) 2014 Reprints and permissions: sagepub.co.uk/journalsPermissions.nav.",Big Data epistemology; biology; data curation; data infrastructures; data-intensive science; databases; model organisms,,,,,,"Seventh Framework Programme, FP7

Its origins are in the scientific revolution of the 17th century in Western Europe. But it is not named as such until the middle of the 19th century, and not formally institutionalized until another hundred years later when it is associated with work by George Zipf and John Stewart. Social physics is marked by the belief that large-scale statistical measurement of social variables reveals underlying relational patterns that can be explained by theories and laws found in natural science, and physics in particular. This larger epistemological position is known as monism, the idea that there is only one set of principles that applies to the explanation of both natural and social worlds. Social physics entered geography through the work of the mid-20th-century geographer William Warntz, who developed his own spatial version called “macrogeography.” It involved the computation of large data sets, made ever easier with the contemporaneous development of the computer, joined with the gravitational potential model. Our argument is that Warntz's concerns with numeracy, large data sets, machine-based computing power, relatively simple mathematical formulas drawn from natural science, and an isomorphism between natural and social worlds became grounds on which Big Data later staked its claim to knowledge; it is a past that has not yet passed. © The Author(s) 2014 Reprints and permissions: sagepub.co.uk/journalsPermissions.nav.",Big Data; computerization; macrogeography; Social physics; spatial analysis; William Warntz,,,,,,,"We would like to thank Eric Sheppard for helpful discussions, especially around the mathematical intricacies of power laws and potential models.

The project is a collective exercise in which we – a mixture of social scientists, designers and makers – and those living and working on one street in Cambridge (UK), Tenison Road, are working to think through how data might be materialised and come to matter. The project aims to better understand the specificities and contingencies that arise when data is produced and used in place. Mid-way through the project, we use this commentary to give some background to the work and detail one or two of the troubles we have encountered in putting locally relevant data to work. We also touch on a methodological standpoint we are working our way into and through, one that we hope complicates the separations between subject and object in data-making and opens up possibilities for a generative refiguring of the manifold relations. © The Author(s) 2014 Reprints and permissions: sagepub.co.uk/journalsPermissions.nav.",community; Computation; data; design; fieldwork; street life,,,,,,,,,"Barad, K.M., (2007) Meeting the Universe Halfway: Quantum Physics and the Entanglement of Matter and Meaning, , Durham, NC, Duke University Press; Beer, D., Burrows, R., Popular culture, digital archives and the new social life of data (2013) Theory, Culture & Society, 30 (4), pp. 47-71; Latour, B., Jensen, P., Venturini, T., ‘The whole is always smaller than its parts’ – A digital test of Gabriel Tarde's monads (2012) British Journal of Sociology, 63 (4), pp. 590-615; Mackenzie, A., The performitivity of code: Software and cultures of circulation (2005) Theory, Culture & Society, 22 (1), pp. 71-92; Mackenzie, A., (2006) Cutting Code: Software and Sociality, , New York, Peter Lang; Solove, D., (2011) Nothing to Hide: The False Tradeoff between Privacy and Security, , New Haven, CT: Yale University Press; Verran, H., (2001) Science and African Logic, , London, University of Chicago Press; Wilson, M.W., Data matter(s): Legitimacy, coding, and qualifications-of-life (2011) Environment and Planning D: Society and Space, 29 (5), pp. 857-872","Taylor, A.S.; Microsoft ResearchUnited Kingdom; email: ast@microsoft.com",,,SAGE Publications Ltd,,,,,20539517,,,,English,Big Data Soc.,Note,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85074201216

These issues are not unprecedented, but the debate highlighted that, in focusing on research ethics and the legal issues about this type of research, an important larger picture is overlooked about the extent to which free will is compatible with the growth of deterministic scientific knowledge, and how Big Data research has become central to this growth of knowledge. After discussing the ‘emotional contagion study’ as an illustration, these larger issues about Big Data and scientific knowledge are addressed by providing definitions of data, Big Data and of how scientific knowledge changes the human-made environment. Against this background, it will be possible to examine why the uses of data-driven analyses of human behaviour in particular have recently experienced rapid growth. The essay then goes on to discuss the distinction between basic scientific research as against applied research, a distinction which, it is argued, is necessary to understand the quite different implications in the context of scientific as opposed to applied research. Further, it is important to recognize that Big Data analyses are both enabled and constrained by the nature of data sources available. Big Data research is bound to become more widespread, and this will require more awareness on the part of data scientists, policymakers and a wider public about its contexts and often unintended consequences. © The Author(s) 2014 Reprints and permissions: sagepub.co.uk/journalsPermissions.nav.",Big Data; epistemology; privacy; research ethics; social networking sites; social science,,,,,,,"This paper has benefitted from discussions with Eric T Meyer, Linnet Taylor and Josh Cowls, as well as from several careful and helpful reviewers from Big Data & Society.",,"Andrejevic, A., Gates, K., Big Data Surveillance (2014) Special Issue of Surveillance and Society, 12. , eds; (2014) Facebook Faces UK Probe over Emotion Study, , http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-28102550, Available at:, accessed 2 December 2014; Beniger, J., (1986) The Control Revolution: Technological and Economic Origins of the Information Society, , Cambridge, MA, Harvard University Press; Bond, R., Fariss, C., Jones, J., A 61-million-person experiment in social influence and political mobilization (2012) Nature, 489, pp. 295-298; Borgman, C., Big Data, Little Data, No Data, , forthcoming, Cambridge, MA, MIT Press; boyd, D., Crawford, K., Critical questions for big data: Provocations for a cultural, technological and scholarly phenomenon (2012) Information, Communication and Society, 15 (5), pp. 662-679; Brown, I., Marsden, C., (2013) Regulating Code: Good Governance and Better Regulation in the Information Age, , Cambridge, MA, MIT Press; (2014) Human Research Participant Protection Program Institutional Review Board (IRB), , http://www.irb.cornell.edu/documents/IRB%20Policy%201%20%28Oct%202013%29.pdf, accessed 2 December 2014; (2014) Media Statement on Cornell University’s Role in Facebook ‘emotional contagion’ Research, , http://mediarelations.cornell.edu/2014/06/30/media-statement-on-cornell-universitys-role-in-facebook-emotional-contagion-research/, accessed 2 December 2014; Eagle, N., Greene, K., (2014) Reality Mining: Using Big Data to Engineer a Better World, , Cambridge, MA, MIT Press; Fuchs, C., (2013) Social Media: A Critical Introduction, , London, Sage; (2014) IT Glossary Big Data, , http://www.gartner.com/it-glossary/big-data/, Available at:, accessed 2 December 2014; Golder, S., Macy, M., Digital footprints: opportunities and challenges for online social research (2014) Annual Review of Sociology, 40, pp. 1-24; González-Bailón, S., Wang, N., Rivero, A., Assessing the bias in samples of large online networks (2014) Social Networks, 38, pp. 16-27; Greenleaf, G., Data protection in a globalised network (2013) Research Handbook on Governance of the Internet, pp. 221-259. , Brown I., (ed), Cheltenham, Edward Elgar Publishing, In:, (ed; Greenleaf, G., Sheherezade and the 101 data privacy laws: Origins, significance and global trajectories (2014) Journal of Law, Information & Science, 23 (1); Grimmelman, J., (2014) Personal website, with sources for the facebook emotional manipulation study, , http://laboratorium.net/archive/2014/06/30/the_facebook_emotional_manipulation_study_source, Available at:, (accessed 2 December 2014); (2014) Privacy Watchdog Files Complaint over Facebook Emotion Experiment, , http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/jul/04/privacy-watchdog-files-complaint-over-facebook-emotion-experiment, Guardian, Guardian, 4 July, accessed 2 December 2014; Facebook's ‘experiment' was socially irresponsible (2014) Guardian, , http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/jul/01/facebook-socially-irresponsible, 1 July, Available at:, accessed 2 December 2014; (2014) Facebook Apologises for Psychological Experiments on Users, , http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/jul/02/facebook-apologises-psychological-experiments-on-users, Guardian, 2 July, Available at:, accessed 2 December 2014; Facebook reveals news feed experiment to control emotions (2014) Guardian, , http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/jun/29/facebook-users-emotions-news-feeds, 29 June.

Attention has shifted from late C20th information technologies and networks to a C21st focus on data, currently crystallized in “Big Data.” Big Data intensifies certain surveillance trends associated with information technology and networks, and is thus implicated in fresh but fluid configurations. This is considered in three main ways: One, the capacities of Big Data (including metadata) intensify surveillance by expanding interconnected datasets and analytical tools. Existing dynamics of influence, risk-management, and control increase their speed and scope through new techniques, especially predictive analytics. Two, while Big Data appears to be about size, qualitative change in surveillance practices is also perceptible, accenting consequences. Important trends persist – the control motif, faith in technology, public-private synergies, and user-involvement – but the future-orientation increasingly severs surveillance from history and memory and the quest for pattern-discovery is used to justify unprecedented access to data. Three, the ethical turn becomes more urgent as a mode of critique. Modernity's predilection for certain definitions of privacy betrays the subjects of surveillance who, so far from conforming to the abstract, disembodied image of both computing and legal practices, are engaged and embodied users-in-relation whose activities both fuel and foreclose surveillance. © The Author(s) 2014 Reprints and permissions: sagepub.co.uk/journalsPermissions.nav.",Big Data; control; ethics; privacy; Snowden; Surveillance,,,,,,,The author wishes to thank Chris Parsons and Ian Kerr and also two anonymous reviewers for their constructive critique.,,"Agamben, G., (2013) For a Theory of Destituent Power.

In particular, it critically explores new forms of empiricism that declare ‘the end of theory’, the creation of data-driven rather than knowledge-driven science, and the development of digital humanities and computational social sciences that propose radically different ways to make sense of culture, history, economy and society. It is argued that: (1) Big Data and new data analytics are disruptive innovations which are reconfiguring in many instances how research is conducted; and (2) there is an urgent need for wider critical reflection within the academy on the epistemological implications of the unfolding data revolution, a task that has barely begun to be tackled despite the rapid changes in research practices presently taking place. After critically reviewing emerging epistemological positions, it is contended that a potentially fruitful approach would be the development of a situated, reflexive and contextually nuanced epistemology. © The Author(s) 2014 Reprints and permissions: sagepub.co.uk/journalsPermissions.nav.",Big Data; computational social sciences; data analytics; data-driven science; digital humanities; end of theory; epistemology; paradigms,,,,,,"European Research Council, ERC: ERC-2012-AdG-323636","Evelyn Ruppert and Mark Boyle provided some useful comments on an initial draft of this paper.

As a result, the accessibility of the growing number of Big Data-capable technology solutions has often been the preserve of business analytics. Pay as you store/process services like Amazon Web Services have opened up possibilities for smaller scale Big Data projects. There is high demand for this type of research in the digital humanities and digital sociology, for example. However, scholars are increasingly finding themselves at a disadvantage as available data sets of interest continue to grow in size and complexity. Without a large amount of funding or the ability to form interdisciplinary partnerships, only a select few find themselves in the position to successfully engage Big Data. This article identifies several notable and popular Big Data technologies typically implemented using large and extremely powerful cloud-based systems and investigates the feasibility and utility of development of Big Data analytics systems implemented using low-cost commodity hardware in basic and easily maintainable configurations for use within academic social research. Through our investigation and experimental case study (in the growing field of social Twitter analytics), we found that not only are solutions like Cloudera’s Hadoop feasible, but that they can also enable robust, deep, and fruitful research outcomes in a variety of use-case scenarios across the disciplines. © The Author(s) 2014 Reprints and permissions: sagepub.co.uk/journalsPermissions.nav.",Big Data; Big Data research methods; digital humanities; digital sociology; social media research methods; Twitter,,,,,,,"The authors thank Alexander Gross for extensive, generous, and invaluable technical assistance and support in all phases of this project and for assistance in producing Figure 1.",,"Andrikopoulos, V., Fehling, C., Leymann, F., Designing for CAP – The effect of design decisions on the CAP properties of cloud-native applications (2012) CLOSER, , Porto, Portugal, 18 April; Hadoop, A., (2013) Apache Hive TM, , https://hive.apache.org/, accessed 8 April 2013; (2013) Number of Active Users at Facebook over the years.– Yahoo!

However, the old data sets share one key component: large numbers. The term “Big Data” is not synonymous with large numbers. Large numbers are a key component of Big Data in health and medicine, both for understanding the full range of how a disease presents in a human for diagnosis, and for understanding if one treatment of a disease is better than another treatment or better than just leaving the patient on his or her own without therapy. In this paper, we examine the first considerations of Big Data in medicine in Paris in the early 1800s when urologic surgeon Jean Civiale collected the first large numbers. Civiale collected the large numbers to defend the efficacy of his urologic instrument, the lithotrite, and the surgical procedure he developed, lithotrity, for the removal of bladder stones compared with earlier, more invasive surgical approaches. We examine how large numbers were adjudicated in social decision-making in the Académie des sciences, Paris, when a dispute arose among French urologic surgeons about the importance of large numbers in surgical science. After Civiale’s successful defense of his instrument and procedure in Paris, we examine how his approach to Big Data (large numbers) impacted data collection by George Buchanan in his use of the procedure at the Royal Hospital Infirmary in Glasgow. © The Author(s) 2014 Reprints and permissions: sagepub.co.uk/journalsPermissions.nav.",bladder stones; large numbers; lithotomy; lithotrite; lithotrity; mortality; survival; “Big Data”,,,,,,,,,"Belinaye, H.G., (1837) Compendium of Lithotripsy, p. 179. , London, JB Bailliere; Black, N., Commentary: That was then, this is now (2001) International Journal of Epidemiology, 30 (6), p. 1251; Boivin, J., Formula for successful cost control includes hard data plus surgeon champion (2014) OR Manager, 30 (4), p. 14; Britt, L.D., Peitzman, A., Barie, P., (2002) Acute Care Surgery, p. 60. , Philadelphia, Wohlers Kluwer/Liincott Williams & Wilcott; Brown, R.D., De, S., Sarkissian, C., Best practices in shock wave lithotripsy: A comparison of regional practice patterns (2014) Urology, 83 (5), pp. 1060-1064; Buchanan, G., Reasons for Preferring Lithotrity to Lithotomy in Operating for Stone in Adult Male, with Cases.

In this commentary, we address such epochal (“large-scale”) questions by way of a (situated) experiment: at the Danish Technical University in Copenhagen, an interdisciplinary group of computer scientists, physicists, economists, sociologists, and anthropologists (including the authors) is setting up a large-scale data infrastructure, meant to continually record the digital traces of social relations among an entire freshman class of students (N > 1000). At the same time, fieldwork is carried out on friendship (and other) relations amongst the same group of students. On this basis, the question we pose is the following: what kind of knowledge is obtained on this social micro-cosmos via the Big (computational, quantitative) and Small (embodied, qualitative) Data, respectively? How do the two relate? Invoking Bohr’s principle of complementarity as analogy, we hypothesize that social relations, as objects of knowledge, depend crucially on the type of measurement device deployed. At the same time, however, we also expect new interferences and polyphonies to arise at the intersection of Big and Small Data, provided that these are, so to speak, mixed with care. These questions, we stress, are important not only for the future of social science methods but also for the type of societal (self-)knowledge that may be expected from new large-scale social databases. © The Author(s) 2014 Reprints and permissions: sagepub.co.uk/journalsPermissions.nav.",Big Data critique; computational social science; method devices; Principle of complementarity; quali-quantitative methods; social science experiments,,,,,,Villum Fonden,"A first version of this text was presented at the University of Copenhagen’s An Open World: Bohr Conference 2013 .

By looking at Big Data deployment in a number of key economic sectors, it seeks to provide a better understanding of the opportunities and challenges of using it for addressing key issues facing the developing world. It reviews the uses of Big Data in agriculture and farming activities in developing countries to assess the capabilities required at various levels to benefit from Big Data. It also provides insights into how the current digital divide is associated with and facilitated by the pattern of Big Data diffusion and its effective use in key development areas. It also discusses the lessons that developing countries can learn from the utilization of Big Data in big corporations as well as in other activities in industrialized countries. © The Author(s) 2014 Reprints and permissions: sagepub.co.uk/journalsPermissions.nav.",agriculture; Big Data; cellphone; data privacy and security; development; healthcare; smallholder farmers; social media,,,,,,,Constructive comments on earlier versions from co-editor Dr Irina Shklovski and two anonymous Big Data & Society reviewers helped to improve the paper substantially.,,"Acquisti, A., Gross, R., Predicting social security numbers from public data (2009) Proceedings of the National Academy of Science, 106 (27), pp. 10975-10980; (2013) Big Data: Vital Statistics for Development, , http://www.adb.org/features/big-data-vital-statistics-development, accessed 18 August 2014; Allen, D., New telecommunications services: Network externalities and critical mass (1998) Telecommunications Policy, 12, pp. 257-271; Antonelli, C., The international diffusion of new information technologies (1986) Research Policy, 3, pp. 139-147; Archibugi, D., Michie, J., Technological globalisation or national systems of innovation?

Analyzing fundamental elements in the changing syntax of existing visual software ontology—the ways current social media platforms and aggregators organize and categorize social media images—this article relates how visual materials created within social media platforms manifest distinct modes of knowledge production and acquisition. First, I analyze the structure of social media images within data streams as opposed to previous information organization in a structured database. While the database has no pre-defined notions of time and thus challenges traditional linear forms, the data stream re-emphasizes the linearity of a particular data sequence and activates a set of new relations to contemporary temporalities. Next, I show how these visual arrangements and temporal principles are manifested and discussed in three artworks: “Untitled” (Perfect Lovers) by Felix Gonzalez-Torres (1991), The Clock by Christian Marclay (2011), and Last Clock by Jussi Ängeslevä and Ross Cooper (2002). By emphasizing the technical and poetic ways in which social media situate the present as a “thick” historical unit that embodies multiple and synchronous temporalities, this article illuminates some of the conditions, challenges, and tensions between former visual structures and current ones, and unfolds the cultural significations of contemporary big visual data. © The Author(s) 2014 Reprints and permissions: sagepub.co.uk/journalsPermissions.nav.",data stream; Social media; social media image; social photography; temporality; visual social media,,,,,,,,,"Aggarwal, C., (2007) Data Streams: Models and Algorithms, , New York, Springer; Anderson, B., (1991) Imagined Communities, , New York, Verso; Avery, J.M., The democratization of metadata: Collective tagging, folksonomies and web 2.0 (2010) Library Student Journal, 5. , http://www.librarystudentjournal.org/index.php/lsj/article/view/135/268, (accessed 12 July 2014; Babcock, B., Models and issues in data stream systems (2002) The Twenty-First ACM SIGMOD-SIGACT-SIGART Symposium on Principles of Database Systems, pp. 1-16. , Madison, WI, USA, 2–6 June 2002, New York, ACM; Banerjee, K., Anderson, M., Batch metadata assignment to archival photograph collections using facial recognition software (2013) Code4lib Journal, , http://journal.code4lib.org/articles/8486, accessed 12 July 2014; Beer, D., Power through the algorithm?

Our aim is to suggest how sociology and social sciences may respond to the challenges and opportunities presented by this ‘data deluge’ in ways that are innovative yet sensitive to the social and ethical life of data and methods. We begin by reviewing relevant contemporary methodological debates and consider how they relate to the emergence of big and broad social data as a product, reflexive artefact and organizational feature of emerging global digital society. We then explore the challenges and opportunities afforded to social science through the widespread adoption of a new generation of distributed, digital technologies and the gathering momentum of the open data movement, grounding our observations in the work of the Collaborative Online Social Media ObServatory (COSMOS) project. In conclusion, we argue that these challenges and opportunities motivate a renewed interest in the programme for a ‘public sociology’, characterized by the co-production of social scientific knowledge involving a broad range of actors and publics. © The Author(s) 2014 Reprints and permissions: sagepub.co.uk/journalsPermissions.nav.",Big Data; co-production; collaboration; COSMOS; methods innovation; public sociology; social media,,,,,,"Economic and Social Research Council, ESRC: ES/K008013/1, ES/J009903/1

We are moving towards changes in how ethics has to be perceived: away from individual decisions with specific and knowable outcomes, towards actions by many unaware that they may have taken actions with unintended consequences for anyone. Responses will require a rethinking of ethical choices, the lack thereof and how this will guide scientists, governments, and corporate agencies in handling Big Data.

Big Data allows us to produce summaries of human behavior at a scale never before possible. But in the push to produce these summaries, we risk losing sight of a secondary but equally important advantage of Big Data—the plentiful representation of minorities. Women, minorities and statistical outliers have historically been omitted from the scientific record, with problematic consequences. Big Data affords the opportunity to remedy those omissions. However, to do so, Big Data researchers must choose to examine very small subsets of otherwise large datasets. I encourage researchers to embrace an ethical, empirical and epistemological stance on Big Data that includes minorities and outliers as reference categories, rather than the exceptions to statistical norms. © The Author(s) 2014 Reprints and permissions: sagepub.co.uk/journalsPermissions.nav.",Big Data; computational social science; epistemology; feminism; sampling; women,,,,,,,,,"boyd, D., Crawford, K., Critical questions for big data: Provocations for a cultural, technological, and scholarly phenomenon (2012) Information, Communication & Society, 15 (5), pp. 662-679; Clance, P.R., Imes, S.A., The imposter phenomenon in high achieving women: Dynamics and therapeutic intervention (1978) Psychotherapy: Theory, Research & Practice, 15 (3), p. 241; Fox, J., Tang, W.Y., Sexism in online video games: The role of conformity to masculine norms and social dominance orientation (2013) Computers in Human Behavior, 33, pp. 314-320; Gilligan, C., (1982) In a Different Voice, , Cambridge, MA, Harvard University Press; Keller, E.F., (1995) Reflections on Gender and Science, , New Haven, CT, Yale University Press; Lazer, D., Pentland, A.S., Adamic, L.A., Life in the network: The coming age of computational social science (2009) Science, 323 (5915), pp. 721-723; Smith, D.E., Women’s perspective as a radical critique of sociology (1974) Sociological Inquiry, 44 (1), pp. 7-13","Welles, B.F.; Northeastern UniversityUnited States; email: b.welles@neu.edu",,,SAGE Publications Ltd,,,,,20539517,,,,English,Big Data Soc.,Article,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84953636657

In this paper, we look beyond the quantitative aspects of Big Data (i.e. lots of data) and examine it from a sociotechnical perspective. We argue that a key factor that distinguishes “Big Data” from “lots of data” lies in changes to the traditional, well-established “control zones” that facilitated clear provenance of scientific data, thereby ensuring data integrity and providing the foundation for credible science. The breakdown of these control zones is a consequence of the manner in which our network technology and culture enable and encourage open, anonymous sharing of information, participation regardless of expertise, and collaboration across geographic, disciplinary, and institutional barriers. We are left with the conundrum—how to reap the benefits of Big Data while re-creating a trust fabric and an accountable chain of responsibility that make credible science possible. © The Author(s) 2014.",Big Data; control zone; paradigm shift; sociotechnical,,,,,,,,,"Agrawal, D., Bernstein, P., Bertino, E., (2014) Challenges and Opportunities with Big Data, , https://www.purdue.edu/discoverypark/cyber/assets/pdfs/BigDataWhitePaper.pdf; Anderson, C., The end of theory: Will the data deluge make the scientific method obsolete?

This paper draws on the political economy of information which explains why the online industry fails to self-regulate, resulting in increasingly insidious web-tracking technologies. Content analysis of historical blogs and request for comments on HTTP cookies published by the Internet Engineering Task Force illustrates how cookie technology was introduced in the mid-1990s, amid stark warnings about increased system vulnerabilities and deceptive personal data extractions. In conclusion, online users today are left with few alternatives but to enter into unconscionable contracts about the extraction of their personal data when using the Internet for private purposes. © The Author(s) 2014 Reprints and permissions: sagepub.co.uk/journalsPermissions.nav.",agency; Big Data; HTTP cookies; personal data; political economy of information; Web-tracking technology,,,,,,,,,"Acar, G., Eubank, C., Englehardt, S., (2014) The Web Never Forgets: Persistent Tracking Mechanisms in the Wild, , https://securehomes.esat.kuleuven.be/, Draft – July 24, (accessed July 2014); Aiden, E., Baptiste, M.J., (2013) Uncharted: Big Data as a Lens on Human Culture, , New York, NY, Riverhead Books; Babe, R.E., Information industries and economic analysis: Policy-makers beware (1983) Proceedings from the Tenth Annual Telecommunications Policy Research Conference, pp. 123-135. , OH Gandy Jr, P Espinosa, JA Ordover, Norwood, NJ, Annapolis, Maryland: Ablex Publishing Corp., 25–28 April 1982; Baker, C.E., (2002) Media, Markets, and Democracy, , New York, NY, Cambridge University Press; Bamford, J., (1982) The Puzzle Palace: Inside the National Security Agency, America's Most Secret Intelligence Organization, , Boston, Houghton Mifflin; Barth, A., (2011) HTTP State Management Mechanism, , http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6265.txt, RFC 6265, (accessed July 2014); Benello, C.G., Technology and power: Technique as a mode of understanding modernity (1981) Jacques Ellul: Interpretive Essays, pp. 91-107. , Christians C.G., van Hook J.M., (eds), Urbana, University of Illinois Press, In:, (eds; (2012) The Value of Our Identity, Liberty Global Policy Series, , https://www.bcgperspectives.com/content/articles/digital_economy_consumer_insight_value_of_our_digital_identity/, (accessed September 2014); Bourdieu, P., (1990) The Logic of Practice, , Stanford, CA, Stanford University Press; Chang, R.M., Kauffman, R.J., Kwon, Y.O.K., Understanding the paradigm shift to computational social science in the presence of Big Data (2014) Decision Support Systems, 63, pp. 67-80; Chen, M., Shiwen, M., Yunhao, L., Big Data: A survey (2014) Mobile Network Applications, 19, pp. 171-209; Crump, C., Harwood, M., Invasion of the data snatchers: Big Data and the internet of things (2014) ACLU Blog, , https://www.aclu.org/blog, 25 March, (accessed November 2014); Cumbley, R., Church, P., Is “Big Data” creepy?

Big Data provides opportunities, but in order to make optimal use of Big Data, a number of challenges have to be addressed. This stimulates increased collaboration between National Statistical Institutes, Big Data holders, businesses and universities. In time, this may lead to a shift in the role of statistical institutes in the provision of high-quality and impartial statistical information to society. In this paper, the changes in context, the opportunities, the challenges and the way to collaborate are addressed. The collaboration between the various stakeholders will involve each partner building on and contributing different strengths. For national statistical offices, traditional strengths include, on the one hand, the ability to collect data and combine data sources with statistical products and, on the other hand, their focus on quality, transparency and sound methodology. In the Big Data era of competing and multiplying data sources, they continue to have a unique knowledge of official statistical production methods. And their impartiality and respect for privacy as enshrined in law uniquely position them as a trusted third party. Based on this, they may advise on the quality and validity of information of various sources. By thus positioning themselves, they will be able to play their role as key information providers in a changing society. © The Author(s) 2014 Reprints and permissions: sagepub.co.uk/journalsPermissions.nav.",Big Data; European Statistical System; official statistics,,,,,,,The views expressed in this contribution are those of the authors and do not necessarily reflect the position of Statistics Netherlands.

It develops this through two contrasting examples: the sociological study of social actors used of analytics to meet their own social ends (for example, by community organisations) and the study of actors’ attempts to build an economy of information more open to civic intervention than the existing one (for example, in the environmental sphere). The article concludes with a consideration of the broader norms that might contextualise these empirical studies, and proposes that they can be understood in terms of the notion of voice, although the practical implementation of voice as a norm means that voice must sometimes be considered via the notion of transparency. © The Author(s) 2014 Reprints and permissions: sagepub.co.uk/journalsPermissions.nav.",Agency; analytics; political economy; reflexivity; transparency; voice,,,,,,,,,"Beer, D., Power through the algorithm?

It was only towards the very end of 2010 that the term began to register, just ahead of an explosion of interest from 2011 onwards. In this commentary we take the opportunity to reflect back on the claims we made in that original paper in light of more recent discussions about the social scientific implications of the inundation of digital data. Did our paper, with its emphasis on the emergence of, what we termed, ‘social transactional data’ and ‘digital byproduct data’ prefigure contemporary debates that now form the basis and rationale for this excellent new journal? Or was the paper more concerned with broader methodological, theoretical and political debates that have somehow been lost in all of the loud babble that has come to surround Big Data. Using recent work on the BBC Great British Class Survey as an example this brief paper offers a reflexive and critical reflection on what has become – much to the surprise of its authors – one of the most cited papers in the discipline of sociology in the last decade. © The Author(s) 2014 Reprints and permissions: sagepub.co.uk/journalsPermissions.nav.",Big Data; class; crisis; empirical; methods; Sociology,,,,,,,,,"Adkins, L., Lury, C., (2012) Measure and Value, , Oxford, Wiley Blackwell; Back, L., Puwar, N., (2013) Live Methods, , Oxford, Wiley Blackwell; Beer, D., Burrows, R., Sociology and, of and in Web 2.0: Some initial considerations (2007) Sociological Research Online, , www.socresonline.org.uk/12/5/17.html; Beer, D., Burrows, R., Popular culture, digital archives and the new social life of data (2013) Theory, Culture & Society, 30, pp. 47-71; Burrows, Visualisation, digitalisation and the ‘descriptive turn’ in contemporary sociology (2011) The Handbook of Visual Culture, pp. 572-588. , Heywood I., Sandywell B., (eds), London, Berg, In:, (eds; Burrows, R., Living with the H-index?

Its originality is twofold. First, it examines a corpus of reports covering 18 years of international climate negotiations, a dataset never explored before through digital techniques. This corpus is particularly interesting because it provides the most consistent and detailed reporting of the negotiations of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. Second, in this paper we test an original approach to text analysis that combines automatic extractions and manual selection of the key issue-terms. Through this mixed approach, we tried to obtain relevant findings without imposing them on our corpus. The originality of our corpus and of our approach encouraged us to question some of the habits of digital research and confront three common misunderstandings about digital methods that we discuss in the first part of the article (section ‘Three misunderstandings on digital methods in social sciences’). In addition to reflecting on methodology, however, we also wanted to offer some substantial contribution to the understanding of UN-framed climate diplomacy. In the second part of the article (section ‘Three maps on climate negotiations’) we will therefore introduce some of the preliminary results of our analysis. By discussing three visualizations, we will analyze the thematic articulation of the climatic negotiations, the rise and fall of these themes over time and the visibility of different countries in the debate. © The Author(s) 2014 Reprints and permissions: sagepub.co.uk/journalsPermissions.nav.",climate change; climate negotiations; Digital methods; network analysis; science and technology studies; text analysis,,,,,,,,,"Anderegg, W.R.L., Prall, J.W., Harold, J., Expert credibility in climate change (2010) Proceedings National Academy Sciences United States of America, 107 (27), pp. 12107-12109; Barnes, T.J., What’s old is new, and new is old: History and geography's quantitative revolutions (2014) Dialogues in Human Geography, 4 (1), pp. 50-53; Biber, D., Representativeness in Corpus Design (1993) Literary and Linguistic Computing, 8 (4), pp. 243-257; Bjurström, A., Polk, M., Physical and economic bias in climate change research: A scientometric study of IPCC Third Assessment Report (2011) Climatic Change, 108 (1-2), pp. 1-22; Blondel, V.D., Guillaume, J.-L., Lambiotte, R., Fast unfolding of communities in large networks (2008) Journal of Statistical Mechanics, 2008 (10), p. 10008; Bollier, D., Firestone, C., (2010) The Promise and Peril of Big Data, , www.ilmresource.com/collateral/analyst-reports/10334-ar-promise-peril-of-big-data.pdf, Washington, The Aspen Institute, Available at:, accessed 5 July 2014; Boyd, D., Crawford, K., Six provocations for Big Data (2011) A Decade in Internet Time: Symposium on the Dynamics of the Internet and Society, , http://ssrn.com/abstract=1926431, September 2011, accessed 5 July 2014; Carr, N., (2014) The Limits of Social Engineering.

Using interviews conducted with a cross-section of economists, this paper examines perspectives on Big Data across the discipline, the new types of data being used by researchers on economic issues, and the range of responses to this opportunity amongst economists. First, we outline the areas in which it is being used, including the prediction and ‘nowcasting’ of economic trends; mapping and predicting influence in the context of marketing; and acting as a cheaper or more accurate substitute for existing types of data such as censuses or labour market data. We then analyse the broader current and potential contributions of Big Data to economics, such as the ways in which econometric methodology is being used to shed light on questions beyond economics, how Big Data is improving or changing economic models, and the kinds of collaborations arising around Big Data between economists and other disciplines. © The Author(s) 2014 Reprints and permissions: sagepub.co.uk/journalsPermissions.nav.",Big Data; business; econometrics; economics; epistemology; interdisciplinarity,,,,,,,,,"Anderson, C., The end of theory: The data deluge makes the scientific method obsolete (2008) Wired Magazine, , http://www.wired.com/science/discoveries/magazine/16-07/pb_theory, 16 July, Available at:, accessed on 1 April 2014; Antenucci, D., Cafarella, M.J., Levenstein, M.C., Ringtail: Feature selection for easier nowcasting (2013) Webdb ‘13: Sixteenth International Workshop on the Web and Databases, , New York, NY; Bollen, J., Mao, H., Zeng, X., Twitter mood predicts the stock market (2011) Journal of Computational Science, 2 (1), pp. 1-8; Cavallo, A., (2011) Scraped Data and Sticky Prices.

But what might this mean? This paper offers some insights into this claim by, first of all, reworking the notion of the social as a spatial complex of ‘outstincts’. That makes it possible, secondly, to reconsider what a city which is aware of itself might look like, both by examining what kinds of technological practices are becoming commonplace and by considering the particular case of spatial awareness. In turn, this leads to a third rumination on how cities might become aware as different kinds of sprite, channelling outstincts in spatially variable ways. Whatever the case, it is clear that new technical-artistic interventions are required if these sprites are not to become simply servants of the security–entertainment complex. Some of these interventions are examined in the fourth part of the paper. © The Author(s) 2014 Reprints and permissions: sagepub.co.uk/journalsPermissions.nav.",Big Data; City; ontograph; outstinct; sentience; surface,,,,,,,,,"Abrams, J., Hall, P., (2003) Else/Where: Mapping, , Minneapolis, University of Minnesota Press; Amoore, L., Data derivatives: On the emergence of a security risk calculus for our times (2011) Theory, Culture and Society, 28, pp. 24-43; Anderson, E., (2011) The Cosmopolitan Canopy.
