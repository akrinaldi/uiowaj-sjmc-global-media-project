This paper examines the discursive processes which are involved in the construction and negotiation of disagreement expressed by government spokespersons when they are confronted with a diverse range of journalistic questions. Drawing on 40 h of video-recorded press conferences released by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China, we will argue that spokespersons often respond to questions by employing a number of disagreement strategies (giving opposing opinions, making negative comments, raising rhetorical questions, taking a personal stance, making an ironic statement and providing facts). Through the use of such forms of disagreement behavior, the spokesperson not only manages the (potential) face-threats that are triggered by the questions, but also positions the government as a ‘moral actor’ in the media. A close look at these conversations between spokespersons and journalists reveal that cultural and socio-political issues could provide possible reasons for these usages of disagreement expressed in Chinese press conferences. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Chinese spokespersons; Disagreements; Face; Morality; Press conferences",,,,,,"19YYD220

Within religious contexts especially, motherhood blogs are often seen as suitable activities for women (and for young stay-at-home-mothers in particular). Motherhood blogs, like similar female-oriented texts such as internet parenting forums, have a key role to play in terms of understanding, replicating, and/or challenging gendered norms, both online and off (cf. Mackenzie 2017b, 2018). This article examines two sets of so-called ‘mommy bloggers’ from North American Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saint and Evangelical Christian backgrounds, following Knapton's (2013) work on metaphor in pro-anorexia blogs. It analyses emergent online representations of motherhood in these two internet communities whose faith groups hold similar (yet not identical) beliefs, which include beliefs about the divine calling and design of being a mother. The analysis of selected extracts from the blogs suggests an explicit foregrounding of religious elements in the Evangelical Christian blogs, whereas the religious context tends to be more subtly expressed or axiomatic for the Latter-day Saint bloggers. Common metaphors of motherhood (such as MOTHERHOOD IS A JOURNEY) appear frequently in the discourse of both digital communities, presenting motherhood as a difficult yet immensely rewarding experience, and one which can be shared with others online. © 2020","Bloggers; Metaphor; Motherhood; Religion",,,,,,,,,"Bartkowski, J.P., Remaking the Godly Marriage: Gender Negotiation in Evangelical Families (2001), Rutgers University Press New Brunswick, NJ; Benson, I., Notes towards a (re)definition of the 'secular' (2000) Univ.

B, Ghent, 9000, Belgium","Responses from business embody a new and productive CMC genre, also known as ‘webcare’. In this contribution we investigated responses written by hotels to negative reviews posted on TripAdvisor. More specifically, we analyzed a total number of 300 responses written in three languages, namely English, Dutch and Italian, focusing on a cross-linguistic perspective. Discourse characteristics of these emergent CMC texts have been examined. First, we carried out an analysis of the rhetorical moves structuring the responses in the three languages under examination. Second, we analyzed the responses from a qualitative point of view, using the conceptual framework of Rapport-Management Theory (RMT, Spencer-Oatey, 2008). Results brought to light a substantial similarity between English and Dutch responses in terms of communicative strategies, while consistent divergences have been found in the Italian subset. In particular, dismissing the tourists’ complaints, through moves as denying the service failure, shifting responsibility to others and providing justifications, seem to be linguistic strategies adopted mostly by Italian response writers when compared to the other subsets. These findings suggest how Italian response writers are less concerned with the restoration of customers’ satisfaction and their ‘sociality rights’ (Spencer-Oatey 2008), preferring a more confrontational and defensive style when addressing a service failure. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Business CMC; Cross-linguistic analysis; Move analysis; Online hotel responses; Rapport-management Theory (RMT); TripAdvisor",,,,,,,,,"Bhatia, V., Critical Genre Analysis (2017), Routledge London; Cenni, I., Goethals, P., (2017), pp. 22-30. , Negative hotel reviews on TripAdvisor: A cross-linguistic analysis.

Yet in recent years there has been increased debate regarding women who regret having had children and who question the utilitarian rhetoric of childbirth and parenting. However, there is as yet little research into such counter-discourses of maternity and femininity in online environments. This study addresses this research gap by examining expressions of maternal regret in the Talk fora of Mumsnet, a UK-based parenting website. Focusing on stance-taking, it examines how women attempt to deal with regret and to create a sense of self between the binaries of good/bad mother discourses. The study contributes to an appreciation of the diversity of experiences of motherhood and the emotions and cognition that accompany them – ranging from mourning for one's previous life through guilt to acceptance – and highlights how digitally mediated communication functions as an arena in which women can break the taboo of maternal regret. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Motherhood; Mumsnet; Parenting; Regret; Regretting motherhood; Stance-taking",,,,,,,,,"Allen, K., Walker, A., McCann, B., Feminism and families (2013) Handbook of Marriage and the Family, pp. 139-158. , G.

Recent work on its use for relational functions is primarily confined to the field of marketing, yet little attention has been paid to the linguistic devices that support relationship building on social media plarforms. In this paper, an empirical study is conducted on the use of metadiscourse in WeChat public account advertisements (hereafter WPA ads). Specifically, it examines how three interactional metadiscourse subcategories (engagement markers, self-mentions, and attitude markers) are used for relational acts in Chinese WPA ads. Analysis was conducted on 50 selected advertisements published in 2018 on the public WeChat accounts of five brands in different industries (mobile phone, laptop, tourism, electric appliance, and motorcar). The results indicate that engagement markers, self-mentions, and attitude markers, along with their distinctive linguistic devices, are used to perform the relational acts of directing, addressing, and expressing in WPA ads. This study extends the scope of metadiscourse research by investigating the use of metadiscourse in WPA ads while contributing to a more nuanced understanding of the interpersonal function of metadiscourse in WPA ads. It has implications for the technical writing of WPA ads, raising advertisers’ awareness of how to employ metadiscourse to build solidarity with readers and manage their corporate image in an era of e-commerce. It also evidences the usefulness of applying a pragmatic concept to metadisocurse research, providing insight into how metadiscourse might be approached by drawing on notions from fields other than discourse analysis. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Advertisement; Metadiscourse; Relational act; WeChat Public account",,,,,,"Jiangsu University of Science and Technology, JUST: 1072931703","This work was supported by the 2017 Research Fund for In-service PhD Candidates from Jiangsu University of Science and Technology ( 1072931703 ), China.

It pays particular attention to the period between 1954 and 1966 and, in so doing, fills an important knowledge gap as historical Chinese political metaphors have been somewhat neglected in the field. This study of Chinese metaphors reveals that the source domains PERSONIFICATION, PERSON, ANIMAL and PERFORMANCE were most frequently used to evoke offence in the Chinese political arena. The way in which these offensive metaphors were deployed was dependent on the political situation at that time: for instance, the U.S. was constructed as a ‘tough’ political ‘exploiter’ who was supported by a ‘band’ of minor allies, India as an ‘unreasonable’ representative of the Americans while asserting non-alignment in diplomacy, and the Soviet Union as a ‘cold-blooded’ former friend of China. This historical study is significant for two main reasons. First, it presents the complex socio-political contexts that existed during 1954–1966 when China was undergoing diplomatic development and their influence on the pragmatic use of metaphors for delivering offence. Although some of the metaphors might appear to be outdated when compared with present-day Chinese political language, this change reflects developments in the global political situation and Chinese diplomatic language over the last number of decades. Second, the study highlights the cultural characteristics of Chinese metaphors and demonstrates their use in political discourse for persuading the Chinese public. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Chinese diplomatic discourse; Critical metaphor analysis; Metaphor; National identity construction; Offence",,,,,,"National Office for Philosophy and Social Sciences, NSSFC: 15BYY057","This work was funded by the National Social Science Fund of China (Project number 15BYY057).",,"Atanasova, D., “Keep moving forward.

This research is based on the corpus of Press Conference. The study identifies the linguistic features and pragmatic strategies that are employed by spokespersons and journalists during the Question and Answer (Q&A) sessions of press conferences. The findings reveal that spokespersons choose to use direct and strong denial markers, syntactic formulations and pragmatic strategies to achieve their aims, such as criticising others, restating information, etc. The findings also demonstrate that a journalist often deploys moral stance taking as a device of covert aggression. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Chinese political language use; Covert aggression; Linguistic features; Moral stance taking; Pragmatic strategies",,,,,,,"This study is supported by a grant ( 16BYY179 ) from the National Funds for Social Sciences for research into “A corpus-based semantics-pragmatics interface study of mianzi and lian in their conceptual representations”.",,"Beebe, M.L., (1995), pp. 155-168. , Polite fictions: Instrumental rudeness as pragmatic competence.

The internet has provided a new means of making sense of this experience through ‘expatriate’ blogging. In these blogs the experience of dislocation and relocation, of moving from the taken for granted to uncertainty, is described from the position of being an ‘expat’, a ‘non-local’, or a ‘stranger’ (Schuetz, 1944). Relocation provides a point of reflection as once familiar routines are questioned and initially unfamiliar ones are becoming more established. Whilst this transition is often experienced as a personal one, in the genre of expatriate blogging individuals relate their experience through personal and public self-reflection. Afforded by the chronological nature of these blogs, individuals draw on time as a resource to document their transition, highlighting an evolving identity. In this paper we use Membership Categorisation Analysis to examine expatriate blogging as a discursive practice, and we explore analytically how to approach social identity as fluid and evolving where transnational relocation is framed as categorial transition. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Blogging; Expatriate; Identity transition; Membership categorisation analysis; Transnational relocation",,,,,,"York St John University, YSJ","We thank York St John University for funding the doctoral research that this publication is based on, and members of Languages and Linguistics for their support throughout.

At the same time, they have introduced diverse channels to produce and disseminate animosity. This article explores online discourses as new communicative environments characterized by their unique textual and semiotic features to unfold the discursive constructions of hate and hostility towards Syrian refugees in Turkey. Building on the principles of the Social Media Critical Discourse Studies (SM-CDS) framework proposed by KhosraviNik (2018) and the Discourse-Historical Approach (DHA) by Reisigl and Wodak (2001), the study analyzes a subset of tweets that includes the hashtag #ülkemdesuriyeliistemiyorum (#idontwantsyriansinmycountry) to understand its functions in constructing and proliferating an exclusionary discourse against refugees. The study focuses on referential, argumentation and intensification strategies used in tweets as well as their wider socio-political implications. The results reveal that refugees in Turkey are delineated as threats, invaders, criminals and potential dangers by the users of online media. It is further observed that a sharper rhetoric and a more intense negative-other representation emerge in Twitter as an online public space compared to print media discourses. While scrutinizing the (re)construction and representation of refugees, our analysis has also uncovered that hate and hostility discourses towards refugees constantly operate to build a collective nationalist identity. This interlocking relationship between constructing refugees through stereotypical attributes as a homogeneously dangerous group and forming a collective Turkish identity is manifested at each level of our analysis. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Critical discourse analysis; Hashtag; Online hostility; Refugees; Turkey; Twitter",,,,,,,,,"Androutsopoulos, J., Online data collection (2013) Data Collection in Sociolinguistics: Methods and Applications, pp. 236-250. , C.

PUAs often use discussion forums as a place to share ‘field reports’ of their experiences in seducing and sleeping with women. Such online environments therefore provide a unique communicative space in which the notion of resistance to sex is discursively constructed and represented by forum members. Research in forensic linguistics has traditionally focused on the ways in which discourses of ‘resistance’ are used by police and lawyers to determine whether consent was given in cases of rape and sexual assault. This paper, therefore, provides an alternative perspective to this issue, and applies a corpus-assisted approach to discourse analysis in order to identify the ways in which ‘resistance’ is represented by this part of the PUA community. A collocation analysis of the community-specialist term ‘LMR’ (‘Last Minute Resistance’) finds three major themes emerging from the data: (i) resistance as something to be overcome, (ii) resistance as insincere, and (iii) resistance as remarkable. The paper ends with a discussion of the implications of these findings, namely in terms of counter-balancing the utmost resistance standard in the legal system and providing education to prevent the incitement of sexual aggression and cyber-enabled violent offences against women and girls. © 2020","Corpus linguistics; Discourse analysis; Forensic linguistics; Incitement; Pick-up artists; Sexual violence",,,,,,"SG162829","I express my enormous gratitude to Ikechukwu Onyenwe for his work on collecting and preparing the corpus for analysis.

The international student theme webpages of three Australian and three Chinese universities were examined in relation to how verbal and visual semiotic resources were co-deployed on the webpages to address international students in the climate of neoliberal thinking in higher education. The tools used for analysis and interpretation were informed by socio-semiotic approaches to multimodal discourse analysis, international education discourses and communication accommodation theories. It was found that the Australian and Chinese university webpages differed in several salient ways to the effect that international students were portrayed as agentive and informed individuals to explore a study abroad experience at the Australian universities versus being explicitly guided through their study abroad at the Chinese universities. These results were compared and interpreted as reflecting each country's conception of transnational education. The article concludes with a summary of the impacts of cultural and intercultural factors and neoliberal thinking in higher education on multimodal representations of international students on university webpages and directions for further research. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Communication accommodation; International student; Multimodal discourse analysis; Neoliberal thinking; University webpage",,,,,,,"We would like to thank Dr Wenchao Tu for downloading and capturing the Australian and Chinese university theme pages for international students which were analysed in this study.

By looking at a site where people discuss cinema — The Internet Movie Database (IMDb)—, I examine how digital spaces enable their users to express opinions on this topic, and, specifically, how these participants can present themselves within a type of narrative that I have categorised as multiple-viewing stories. As I argue, by telling stories, users discursively construct a type of expertise that is grounded on shared experience and knowledge. Thus, notions such as knowing participation come to the fore. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Digital communication; Discussion boards; Expertise; Knowing participation; Narrative analysis",,,,,,,,,"Baker, P., Sociolinguistics and Corpus Linguistics (2010), Edinburgh University Press Edinburgh; Bamberg, M., Talk, small stories, and adolescent identities (2004) Hum.

On the one hand, they are highly appreciated by the general public because they work without pay and altruistically provide free access to subtitled audiovisual contents that are otherwise unavailable. On the other hand, they distribute unlicensed contents and violate the copyright law in China. Their practices cause damages to copyright holders and thus call for legal actions. Given the conflicting moral and legal statuses, it is necessary to understand how the Chinese press frame and represent fansubbers, as the media play a crucial role in shaping people's opinions. Drawing on a one-million-word corpus of news reports between 2006 and 2018, this study examines the media frames, discourse topics, and representations about fansubbers in China. Based on keyword, collocation, and concordance analyses, four discourse topics were identified: sharing, volunteerism, copyright, and commercialization. The former two pointed to a moral frame, while the latter two fed into a legal frame. The diachronic analysis demonstrated that the topic of sharing was most prominent in eight of 13 years, while the topic of copyright spiked about every five years. The corpus findings also unravel the complexities of discursive strategies in two aspects: (a) representational strategies work in combination to selectively frame fansubbers and (b) the same discursive strategies can simultaneously moralize and delegitimize fansubbers. This study sheds light on the multifaceted, dynamic, and complex nature of media representations about fansubbers with a conflicting social position. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Chinese press; Corpus-assisted discourse analysis; Fansubbers; Legal; Moral",,,,,,"Hong Kong Polytechnic University, PolyU","This study is supported by a Start-up Fund (1-BE1J, P0000239) from Hong Kong Polytechnic University.",,"Anthony, L., (2019), https://www.laurenceanthony.net/software, AntConc (Version 3.5.8) [Computer Software].

In this sense, Appraisal analysis -particularly, engagement- is used to examine whether the articles are biased in favor of a group (in-group bias). In the present study, only two kinds of these resources are focused: attribution and counter. The hypothesis we are discussing is that, in these articles, engagement categories serve as linguistic indicators of in-group bias. The analysis shows important associations between engagement resources and in-group bias. The findings seem to confirm that bias is usually expressed implicitly rather than explicitly. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Appraisal analysis; In-group bias; International conflicts; User collaborations; Wikipedia",,,,,,"Alexander von Humboldt-Stiftung","This work was supported by the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation, Germany.",,"Arcuri, L., Maass, A., Portelli, G., Linguistic intergroup bias and implicit attributions (1993) British J.

The increasing demands placed on scientists to disseminate and gain visibility for their research and on institutions to account for expenditure on research and innovation, in combination with a myriad of technical affordances, are enhancing the appearance of diverse digital practices, as a way to respond to an ever-changing and increasingly-demanding world. Within this context, the present study explores European Horizon 2020 websites dealing with research projects on energy as generic instances of current digital scientific practices. A special focus is placed on the use of evaluative language in their homepages and about pages in the understanding that evaluative language mirrors the values promoted in scientific research nowadays. In the webpages under analysis the main values promoted are the ones which are attached to two recurrent terms: project and energy. The study also shows the role that evaluative language plays in the construction of argument as discourse organiser. Moreover, the study reveals that, as textual instances, homepages and about pages do not differ much from offline genres, as they do not seem to fully exploit the technical affordances that the digital mode offers. However, they also seem to be subjected to a certain degree of recontextualization. In all, we might point at continuity rather than change in these generic instances. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Digital scientific discourse; Energy; Evaluative language; Horizon 2020 Programme; Values; Websites",,,,,,"Gobierno de AragÃ³n: H16_17R

In these interviews, entertainment and politics are both used and therefore we name them Entertainment-Political Interviews (EPIs). While research on such shows generally assumes that the EPI is a hybrid discourse, crafting entertainment and politics into one coherent discourse, this assumption has not been empirically justified. Using membership categorization analysis (MCA) to study how the participants self-categorize in the EPI, we illustrate how they orient to political and entertainment talk. First, by applying Sacks’ (1972) hearer's maxim to its fullest extent, entertainment and politics are identified as independently foundational devices for the EPI. Second, only one of these devices is relevant at a time to shape a turn at talk. Third, still, each device is continuously relevant to the participants. Thus, the understanding of the activity is based on the separation of the device of politics and of entertainment. Therefore, we argue, the EPI does not result in a hybrid device with a hybrid form of talk, but rather, participants alternate between politics and entertainment. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Entertainment-political interviews; Identity-work; Late-night talk show; Membership categorization analysis; Omnirelevant devices; Politainment; U.S.A. presidential election",,,,,,,,,"Baum, M.A., Talking the vote: why presidential candidates hit the talk show circuit (2005) Am.

Drawing on Discursive News Value Analysis and appraisal, this article investigates the construal of Negativity and Positivity through evaluative resources across visual-verbal semiotic modes in China's English-language news discourse. Sourced from China Daily and People's Daily online websites, 34 news reports featuring evaluative clash are studied by combining corpus semantic tagging method and manual analysis from both the text-as-corpus and text-as-text approaches. The findings show that Negativity is largely and strategically construed through negative lexis and evaluative language towards news participants like China, the US and Australia in international disputes, while visual Positivity plays an important role in orienting readers to the Socialist Core Value of “Harmony” against the negative news stories through their interplay in the heading-image nucleus. Underlying journalistic positions are revealed through close analysis of news value co-construction in three news stories about national issues, in which visual devices are employed to enhance, contradict or complement the linguistic expressions around social value building. © 2020","Appraisal; Evaluative clash; Negativity; News values; Positivity; Socialist Core Values",,,,,,,,,"Bednarek, M., Caple, H., Value added (2012) Language, image and news values’.

Drawing on the sociocognitive approach to context (van Dijk, 2008) and Multimodal Critical Discourse Analysis (Ledin and Machin, 2018a), the paper analyzes a corpus of 30 Arabic and English translated news reports covering ISIS news. Four strategies of multimodal recontextualization were identified; each results in different types of meaning transformation. The analysis shows that recontextualization serves different communicative functions, ranging from epistemic fine-tuning, whose aim is to provide background information necessary for inference-making; cultural adaptability, which optimizes cultural resonance for the targeted readership and enhances text authenticity; and finally normalization of ideological stances across the source and the target texts. The findings suggest that multimodal recontextualization gives rise to different contextual assumptions across source and target texts, embedding each in a different ideological narrative. Conceptualizing these texts as “meaningful wholes” with different semiotic affordances (Ledin and Machin, 2018b) elucidates how recontextualization creates manipulative narratives across languages and modalities. These narratives are created through ideological appropriation made coherent by maintaining referential, spatiotemporal and action continuity along different semiotic levels. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Ideological narratives; ISIS news coverage; Multimodal Critical Discourse Analysis; News translation; Recontextualization",,,,,,,,,"Al-Tahmazi, Thulfiqar. 2016.

More recently some of this work has turned to focus on the methodological implications of these developments. Building on existing scholarship, this paper reviews a range of literature to probe the methodological implications of shifts in possible sites or “entry points” (Heller, Pietkäinen & Pujolar, 2018, 47) to digital discourse and changes in the scope of what counts as data. While we position our paper as a review on methodology, we argue for the importance of engaging with these questions as intricately related to epistemology, theory and the study of language more generally. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Convergence; Digital discourse; Entry point; Methodology; Online and offline interaction; User-based",,,,,,,,,"Adami, E., Retwitting, reposting, repinning: reshaping identities online: towards a social semiotic multimodal analysis of digital remediation (2014) LEA – Lingue e Letterature d'Oriente e d'Occidente, 3, pp. 223-243; Agha, A., Language and Social Relations (2007), Cambridge University Press Cambridge; Androutsopoulos, J., Introduction: sociolinguistics and computer-mediated communication (2006) J.

This work explored how fan communities used Internet sport memes as trash talk within the context of the rivalry matches played between Futbol Club Barcelona and Real Madrid Club de Fùtbol. A grounded theory analysis of memes generated in response to rivalry matches indicated that fans used memes to practice diminution of their rival opponents and idolization of their own players. This was achieved by leveraging current content from recent matches, accessing in-depth knowledge about those contests and the rivalry generally, and juxtapositioning images and text to humorous effect to assert a specific reality among supporters. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Community; Discourse; Fan; Image macro memes; Internet memes; Sport; Supporter; Trash talk",,,,,,,,,"Carmack, H.J., Everythang's gonna be all white: the Fightin’ Whities’ use of parody and incongruity for social change (2011) Florida Commun.

Drawing on a case study of viral discussions on Facebook concerning a hit-and-run traffic accident that took place in March 2019 in Cambodia, this paper explores (1) the key themes that arose from the online conversations and whether they constituted counterpublic discourse, (2) the discursive strategies used by online discussants, and (3) the political implications of such online phenomena. Based on a thematic and discourse analysis of 5000 Facebook comments generated from 100 widely shared public posts about the incident, the study uncovered a number of recurrent themes emerging from the online interactions, most of which were critical of the authoritarian establishment. The study also identified three key discursive strategies employed by Facebook users to discuss and question the status quo: satire, direct criticism and rumour. In addition, guided by Fraser (1990) and Warner (2002)’s concepts of “counterpublics” and boyd (2010)’s recent notion of “networked publics”, the study argues that, through such online discursive interactions, a new social identity in the form of online counterpublics has been formed. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Counterpublics; Direct criticism; Discourse analysis; Dum Rida accident; Facebook; Rumour; Satire",,,,,,,,,"Arun, C., On WhatsApp, rumours, and lynchings (2019) Econ.

While numerous studies investigate real-time participatory engagement of fans on Twitter, athletes’ use of Twitter during competition remains underexplored. Using a case study approach, this study brings together computer-mediated discourse analysis and prior work on involvement in discourse to examine tweets posted during competitive events by two endurance athletes (an experienced amateur marathon runner and an elite rock climber). Specifically, it explores how athletes mobilize various linguistic strategies to create relations of connectedness, or ambient affiliation (Zappavigna, 2011), with their respective audiences who are distanced spatially and often temporally. It also demonstrates how the affordances and limitations of technology, and the constraints of the athletic events themselves, shape ambient involvement. In this way, this work adds to our understanding of how ambient affiliation is constructed in a particular context – a competitive athletic event of an endurance athlete practicing a solitary sport – while also shedding light on how involvement is created and maintained with a largely unknown online audience. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Ambient affiliation; Endurance athletes; Involvement; Online audience; Sports; Twitter",,,,,,,"I am thankful to the editors, Andrew Ross, Damian Rivers, and Caroline Tagg, and the anonymous reviewers for their detailed comments and suggestions.

These have been described as part of a newer kind of ethical or emotional capitalism, where consumers can align with political issues through acts of shopping. The problem is that such acts replace or shape what we know about, and how we act towards, actual socio-political matters. In this paper, we look at one example of such a product: Oatly, a milk alternative, which brands itself as sustainable and anti-corporate. Taking a Multimodal Critical Discourse Analytical approach, we want to learn more about how such brands do not actually state details of the socio-political issue alongside which they align (its causes, process, solutions) yet successfully communicate a compelling sense that buying the product is a form of social activism in a way which cleverly implicates consumers to internalize its values and give them a powerful sense of being part of a political moral order.

They have also shown that brands can add value to products using nationalist messages. However, much less research has gone into how these representations take form in specific national settings. In this article, using multimodal critical discourse analysis, I investigate a sample of Swedish food packaging, and show how the nature represented evokes associations established systematically by governments building up nationalist imagery associated with social democracy, openness, freedom, responsibility, equality and fairness. I argue that at a time when Sweden is moving to the right politically, becoming a model neoliberal society, such representations, used for marketing purposes, help communicate a banal sense that Sweden is very much as it always has been. © 2019 The Author","Banal nationalism; Discourses of nature; Food packaging; Multimodal critical discourse analysis; Multimodality; Swedish nationalism",,,,,,"University of Sunderland","I would like to thank Professors G?ran Eriksson and David Machin at ?rebro University, Sweden for their valuable comments and recommendations on this paper.

Bourdieu, 1984; Shugart, 2014). As a case in point, my paper examines a multimodal dataset of food texts (e.g. online resources, shop displays, and interviews) drawn from an artisanal cured meats producer in Switzerland who explicitly self-styles as the height of modern, cosmopolitan food practices and trends. This so-called ‘progressive’ discourse hinges on the iconization, romanticization and exploitation of agrarian life and peripheral vernaculars, in ways that strategically both claim and deny elitist distinction. I argue that this case study of Swiss artisanal food marketing therefore represents what I call “elite authenticity” (Mapes, 2018); as such, particular ways of eating (and particular eaters) are hailed as simultaneously fashionable and socially/politically virtuous (cf. Kenway and Lazarus, 2017), while covertly reinscribing privileged standards of good taste and class inequality. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Authenticity; Elite food discourse; Social class; Terroir",,,,,,,,,"Mapes Gwynne., forthcoming.

Instagram is an extremely popular platform, particularly in relation to the ‘selfie’, which has led to a growing body of research in relation to selfie types and the different subjective and intersubjective relations they present. This article takes the sport of cycling and investigates how different intersubjective relations and perspectives on the sport and the self are presented by amateur cyclists. The images highlight the different intersubjectivities that can be construed from the images themselves, as well as how they demonstrate an affiliation with the sport. It is argued that cycling demonstrates the relevance of previously documented selfie types as well as offers new possibilities for expanding our understanding of the intersubjective relations offered by selfies in the sporting context. These add not only to our understanding of selfies, but also add further layers of perspective on the sport to those offered by the selfie. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",,,,,,,,,,"Abidin, C., “Aren't these just young, rich women doing vain things online?”: Influencer selfies as subversive frivolity (2016) Soc.

Adopting a sociohistorical approach to the theoretical perspective of social semiotics, it draws attention to the arbitrariness of the term and demonstrates how, over time, advertisers have constructed a particular discourse that equates the purity of a food product with a physical, mental or spiritual type of purity. In doing so, they invest food with a moral authority and legitimacy that leads consumers to understand commodities through marketing discourses and buy into the lifestyle and cultural value that the product promises, although it may not be true. In emphasising how purity has historically been used as a rhetorical device to sell products, the study hopes to encourage consumers to challenge food advertising and be aware of the myths that it can create in order to become empowered and make informed choices about supposedly healthy products. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Advertising; Class; Gender; Marketisation; Pure food; Religion",,,,,,,,,"Altick, R., Writers (1989), Ohio State University Press Readers and Occasions, Columbus; Barnes, A., Telling stories: the role of graphic design and branding in the creation of ‘authenticity’ within food packaging (2017) Int.

This study explores how communication, particularly through new media discourse, enables the organizing process that sustains lifestyle sport participation. Lifestyle sport participants without access to public practice areas often voluntarily construct their own organic participation spaces. After observations, interviews, and social media discourse analysis conducted within a loose collective of BMX dirt jump bikers, findings reveal that the discursive themes of informatives and acknowledgements generate the overall feeling of stoke—an intense excitement and energy surrounding participation in the sport. Stoke, in turn, motivates individuals to contribute and participate in the shared space, while directives then regulate the contributions encouraged through stoke. Thus, discourse plays a role in organizing the participants of a loose collective into a more recognizable assemblage. The article contributes to communication constitutes organizing (CCO) theoretical perspectives by providing further empirical evidence of the hybrid agency of attitudes, and by theorizing discourse as a powerful force for organizing lifestyle sport participation. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Agency; Communication constitutes organizing; Discourse; Lifestyle sport; Organizing; Social media",,,,,,,,,"Axley, S., Managerial and organizational communication metaphor (1984) Acad.

China","In many societies, governments have become concerned about diet related illnesses and the huge economic costs of managing them, disseminating information about things like eating, balanced diets and the foods we should avoid in excess. At the same time in our shops and cafes there have been a proliferation of products which carry possibilities for making more healthy choices. Yet research shows that the health-related properties these products offer are largely contradictory, confusing and more about market buzzwords than actual healthy food. And such healthy choices have tended to blur and merge with notions of ethical and moral shopping. In this introduction to a collection of articles on the discourses of good food, we look at some of the research on ‘good food’ showing exactly what a multimodal critical discourse perspective can contribute to the field. We show that closer analysis of product packaging, marketing, cook books, media reports and policy documents can help us to understand how commercial forces are colonizing and shaping our ideas of what it means to be healthy and also to act as good citizens. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",,,,,,,,,,"Aguirre, B.E., “Sustainable development” as collective surge (2002) Social Sci.

We take empirical data from a UK Channel 4 News interview between TV journalist and author Cathy Newman and clinical psychologist and author Professor Jordan Peterson. Adopting a discourse analytic approach, five aspects of incivility are presented: intolerant response; ideological entrenchment; low oppositional literacy; the need to win; and, change of opinion condemnation. We show how metadiscourse is used to manifest incivility in a number of ways including to prioritise the current speaker's foci over those of the interlocutor; to express metalingual commentary which negatively characterises the interlocutor's discourse; and, to express discourse norms which undermine the open exchange of ideas.

Other than causing offense and undermining the dignity of readers with a different opinion, a rather dangerous outcome of hate speech is that it affects the sociocognitive interface between discourse and society in the sense that it has a negative impact on the readers’ cognitive notions of information, beliefs and knowledge. Based on the analytical approach proposed in Sociocognitive Discourse Studies, the study examines 939 comments posted in the comment section of the Serbian news website Politika. Besides confirming that hate speech in the readers’ comments is a rather frequent means of establishing a communicative Common Ground among news readers, the analysis shows that hate speech is a reflection of the negative impact of news on the sociocognitive interface between discourse and society. The research also demonstrates that Sociocognitive Discourse Studies may be applied to the analysis of readers’ comments as a specific type of written discourse that reflects the mental models news readers create when exposed to media discourse. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Discourse analysis; Hate speech; Readers’ comments; Serbian news websites; Sociocognitive dimension",,,,,,"Deutscher Akademischer Austauschdienst, DAAD

We take up a critical perspective to understand how these discursive practices function in a language climate where LGBTQ+ youth's epistemic primacy over issues affecting them is potentially delegitimized through ageism, heterosexism, and genderism. Specifically, we draw upon discursive psychology to analyze how LGBTQ+ youth build up their epistemic primacy and minimize audience critique. Drawing from a larger ethnographic study, we analyzed textual data in slide decks (i.e., PowerPoint slides) created by an LGBTQ+ youth group for presentations they gave to teachers and other youth-serving professionals about working with LGBTQ+ youth. We found that four discursive strategies were used in the slide decks to manage the youth's epistemic rights, including: (1) using factual claims and outside corroboration, (2) claiming experiential expertise, (3) refuting anticipated critique, and (4) articulating limitations. This study's findings point broadly to how epistemic rights are built in textual data and specifically how minoritized youth construct text to be taken seriously. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Discursive psychology; Epistemic primacy; Epistemic rights; LGBTQ+ youth; Slide decks",,,,,,,,,"Antaki, C., Billig, M., Edwards, D., Potter, J., (2003), https://dspace.lboro.ac.uk/dspace/handle/2134/633, Discourse analysis means doing analysis: A critique of six analytic shortcomings.

This paper begins by introducing on-field language tracking and briefly reviewing the research in sports mediatization and the application of linguistics to sports discourse. Drawing on the applied social-linguistics theory of Systemic Functional Linguistics (Martin and Rose, 2007), with mediatisation as a second-order investigation (Livingstone and Lunt, 2014), the paper examines a range of examples of on-field language tracking from several professional sports including basketball, cricket, and Australian football. An interpersonal discourse semantic analysis (Martin and White, 2005) is applied to the data, with the aim to bring to consciousness the ways in which players construe solidarity and power through language with each other, as well as audience. The results and discussion reveal the emergence of three distinct on-field ‘stances’ – the communing, the condemning and the instructing. The paper then concludes in a more speculative mode, considering key future directions, particularly language tracking in sports mediatization research. © 2019","Interpersonal discourse analysis; Mediatization; On-field language; Power; Solidarity",,,,,,,,,"Author, Working your words’: appraisal in the post-match interview (2009) Aust.

In total, 110 discussion threads in which Jodel users make explicit evaluative remarks on others’ language use are analyzed. Through an analysis of (de)legitimation strategies, the metalinguistic remarks are explored as key discourse elements in the reproduction of language ideologies. The results show that Jodel users promote and uphold a hypercorrect local ideology that, to a large extent, promotes uniformity and traditional standard orthography. Prominent strategies for invoking this local language ideology are humor, repetition, and exposed correction. The metalinguistic comments are used for the purpose of creating boundaries for inclusion and exclusion of community members on the app. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Jodel; Language ideology; Language policy; Legitimation analysis; Social media; Standard language",,,,,,,"I am grateful to G?ran Eriksson, Anders Bj?rkvall, Mats Deutschmann and Ida Melander for their comments on this article.

The increased emphasis on health in “the new public health era” has created a market for products promoted as healthy or with some kind of wellbeing association. Riding on this trend, many companies have emerged and positioned themselves as providing good food options. Employing the theory of social semiotics and using multimodal critical discourse analysis, we ask the following questions: How do these companies use corporate stories to make themselves appear as a better alternative than their competitors? How do they make their products appear healthy and attractive to consumers? And how can this kind of marketing help consumers choose healthier products? The analysis of 22 corporate stories of healthy snack companies shows that healthy eating is colonized by a moral discourse for marketing and branding purposes. Furthermore, the health qualities these companies claim to have are abstract, symbolic, and commercialized. We argue that these corporate stories provide no meaningful indication as to the healthiness of these products and can mislead consumers to consume less healthy food while having the intention to eat healthily. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Corporate stories; Discourse; Healthy diet; Healthy snacks; Multimodal critical discourse analysis; Social semiotics; Storytelling",,,,,,,,,"Aarset, B., Beckmann, S., Bigne, E., Beveridge, M., Bjorndal, T., Bunting, J., The European consumers’ understanding and perceptions of the “organic” food regime: the case of aquaculture (2004) British Food J., 106 (2), pp. 93-105; Aschoff, N., The New Prophets of Capital (2015), Verso New York; Ayo, N., Understanding health promotion in a neoliberal climate and the marking of health conscious citizens (2012) Critical Public Health, 22 (1), pp. 99-105; Cederström, C., Spicer, A., The Wellness Syndrome (2015), Polity Press Cambridge; Chaney, D., Lifestyles (1996), Routledge London; Chrysochou, P., Food health branding: The role of marketing mix elements and public discourse in conveying a healthy brand image (2010) J.

Box 139, Kuils River, South Africa","Vagina Varsity is a South African online campaign aimed at selling Libresse sanitary products to ostensibly young women in South Africa, primarily through the medium of YouTube. In this paper, we investigate the privileging of white women's bodies over those of women of colour in the campaign. In so doing, we tease out how patriarchy is multi-layered and experienced differently by women depending on their race and class. Moreover, we see that black South African women's issues are being served by the campaign only to the extent which they coincide with those of the dominant group, i.e. white women in South Africa. To critically investigate this phenomenon, we use an intersectionality framework (Crenshaw, 1989) to discern latent differences in the treatment of black and white women's bodies in the campaign. Multimodality (Kress, 2010; Iedema, 2003) allows us to analyse texts, sounds and images used in the campaign. Importantly, however, we also adopt Kulick's (2003) notion of ‘dual indexicality’ to explore what is absent or silent in the campaign. We argue that the model of capitalism which commodifies women's empowerment serves to multimodally exclude black women's lived experience of patriarchy and pain. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Commodification; Gender; Intersectionality; Mediatization; Vagina Varsity; Women's empowerment",,,,,,"ZEIN2016RIP36

The retailers, who had anticipated that low prices would be viewed as unequivocally good for consumers, found themselves at the centre of an unexpected media backlash and the subjects of a sustained campaign by the dairy industry to expose the threat of major supermarkets to Australian dairy livelihoods. This paper analyses the news coverage that emerged as a result of the events now dubbed the ‘milk wars’. Through discourse analysis of Australian news stories, we show how the media coverage of milk pricing—and the dairy industry campaigns that underpinned it—sought to galvanise media and public support through specific images and discourses associated with the ‘Australian farmer’. We argue that the discourses and images used most frequently by the dairy industry and which had most cut-through with media were those most strongly invested in Australian pastoral sentimentality: images of traditional, ‘small-scale’, multi-generational family farmers being tragically forced off their land by the supermarket duopoly. We show how this coverage reveals the power of romanticised depictions of farming as a media strategy for galvanising public support for farmers’ livelihoods, but in their focus on (certain types of) farmers and farming practices as ‘worthy’ of public and media concern, these depictions were ultimately co-opted by supermarket marketing campaigns designed to silence critique.

I argue in this paper that the Japanese writing system offers a key mechanism for this indexing. The system traditionally encompasses three different character sets: kanji (characters originally borrowed from/based off of the Chinese writing system), hiragana (a moraic script used for native and functional words), and katakana (a moraic script used for foreign words, sound effects, etc.). These sets each have their own normatively specialized usages, and because of this, they have come to index certain social stereotypes. One aspect of Japanese writing which may also be associated with stereotypes that has been less studied is furigana. Traditionally written in hiragana or katakana, furigana are annotations serving a metalingual function, and are primarily used to give the pronunciations of unknown or obscure kanji that the reader might not recognize. A less-frequently employed secondary purpose is giving a non-standard reading to a kanji character or series of characters. What has not received direct attention yet is how furigana itself can be used to index certain social or cultural stereotypes. While past research has looked at furigana in manga, few of these have looked at systematic uses of non-Japanese furigana readings. Through analysis of the usage of Spanish-derived and German-derived furigana readings in Bleach, it was determined that the origin language of the furigana word often correlates with a certain character type, and functions as a way to inject stereotypes about characters into even small portions of their dialogue. Further, it was determined that many of the social stereotypes concerning these languages were present in word choice and kanji usage, yielding a cultural idea of characterological type without the need for overt characterization, which is helpful in dealing with Bleach's large cast of named characters. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Japanese; Manga; Stereotype injection; Writing systems",,,,,,,,,"(2017), http://www.ajpea.or.jp/information/20170224/index.html, AJPEA 2016 nen no komikku (kami + denshi) shijo wo happyo shimashita.

We examine dynamics of identity work by drawing from metapragmatic discourse on social media regarding a verbal confrontation in Taiwan. A local Taiwanese driver with limited English competence was verbally attacked in English by an American-born-Taiwanese passenger. This passenger's nationality, ethnicity, and controversial linguistic performance lead to heated identity debates online. We look into the role language plays in these online debates and explore how social media serve as an important site for ideological contestation and identity construction. Specifically, we discuss (1) how viewers discursively construct this American-born-Taiwanese as an outgroup member through pronouns and identity labels, such as Taiwanese and ABC, (2) how his (presumed) competence in English or Chinese plays a critical role in deauthenticating him either as a ‘real’ Taiwanese or as a ‘real’ American, and (3) how various language ideologies are manifested through the aforementioned process of identity construction. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Identity; Indexicality; Language attitudes; Language ideology; Metapragmatics; Social media; Sociolinguistic scale; Stancetaking; Taiwan",,,,,,,,,"Babb, J.Y., Multicultural Identity Formation through the eyes of First Generation Taiwanese-American Immigrants: An Exploration Study (2008), Dissertation The Claremont Graduate University and San Diego State University; Barton, D., Lee, C., Language Online: Investigating Digital Texts and Practices (2013), Routledge London; Baykal, N., The discursive construction of ethnic identity: Sulukule case, Turkey (2009) Linguistics J.

The comments thread followed an Op Ed piece that discussed the exclusion of ‘under-performing’ children in British secondary schools. Our analysis of these comments contributes to existing studies of online forums as a mode of public discourse and demonstrates the importance of research that focusses on interactional practices rather than on notions such as ‘politeness’ or ‘framing’. We show the ways that participants used endogenous conversational categories to produce epistemic alignment and disalignment with each other, employing various strategies such as expanding category collections, creating relations between ‘culpable’ categories and ‘trouble’ categories, and re-describing categories through alternate category predicates. Through this, we see that the conversational actions undertaken in the forum are much more complicated than current concepts allow for, and we reflect on what such complexity might mean for the study and design of news forums. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Epistemic alignment; Flaming; Membership categorisation analysis; News forums; Political discourse",,,,,,,,,"Aleksiejuk, K., Personal names on the internet: usernames as address terms (2013) Lang.

By focusing on the fan subtitling practice in the case of Thai fansubbing of a Korean TV programme, we observe unique ways in which fans exploit semiotic resources to produce fansubs in relation to professional subtitling norms. For example, novel features of fansubs include the treatment of “impact captions” prevalent on Korean TV which are typically untranslated in official Thai translations as these captions are not common in Thailand. Using Actor Network Theory (ANT) as a framework, we analyse survey and interview data collected from Thai fansubbing communities of the Korean TV show Running Man (Wongseree, 2018). The data indicate the close interrelationship which seems to develop between fansubbers and “non-translating” members of fan communities. The previously less recognised importance of such an inter-dependency points to the building of trust, especially epistemic trust, which underlies fansubbing practices. We thus argue that this modern alternative circulation mechanism for global media texts can be characterised by the particular way fans exploit semiotic resources and the way in which it is supported by epistemic trust within the fan community. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Actor Network Theory; Epistemic trust; Fan translation; Fansub; Thai fans; Trust",,,,,,,"Dr Thandao Wongseree is a Lecturer at Chiang Mai University, Thailand.

Our analysis focuses on the JOURNEY metaphor scenario, one of the most pervasive metaphor scenarios in Brexit-related political cartoons, particularly emphasising one of its structural elements, namely the MEANS OF TRANSPORTATION. The data collection for the analysis consists of 48 cartoons contained in a video clip named 100 Best Brexit Cartoons, made available on YouTube five days after the EU membership referendum took place in the UK. Our aim is twofold: to show how the MEANS OF TRANSPORTATION metaphor scenario is used to simplify and facilitate the understanding of the complex relations between Britain and the EU at a critical point in their history as well as how the use of the JOURNEY metaphor scenario in multimodal discourse becomes a powerful tool for conveying evaluative content when set within a specific socio-political context. © 2019","Brexit; JOURNEY metaphor scenario; MEANS OF TRANSPORTATION; Multimodality; Political cartoons",,,,,,"Ministarstvo Prosvete, Nauke i TehnoloÅ¡kog Razvoja, MPNTR: 178002","The first author acknowledges funding received by the project of the Ministry of Education, Science and Technological Development of the Republic of Serbia no. 178002 Languages and Cultures in Time and Space .

Self-images as antiracist are maintained through the strategy to deny racism and accusations of racism. This article addresses discourses of racism in a Swedish media debate that started with a YouTuber being accused of using the N-word. Through a categorization analysis of newspaper articles, that report on and debate the incident, the management of accusations and denials, as well as language ideologies and different perspectives on racism, are examined. The analysis shows how the YouTuber, and journalists, deny racism by claiming that the racist expression was an unintentional “gaffe”, thus categorizing the YouTuber as a non-racist. This understanding of racism, as an individual and intentional phenomenon, dominates the debate. However, some debaters advocate a structural discourse of racism, focusing on racist activities rather than racist individuals. Nevertheless, the findings suggest that the media context does not provide room for a nuanced discussion about structural racism and racist language. Instead, the category work indicates that the maintenance of social relations and an antiracist self-image is the core activity of the interaction. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Accusation of racism; Denial of racism; Media debate; Membership categorization analysis; N-word; Race trouble; Sweden",,,,,,,"This work was supported by Erik Wellanders fond.",,"Augoustinos, M., Every, D., The language of ‘race’ and prejudice: a discourse of denial, reason, and liberal-practical politics (2007) J.

In this paper, we analyse the discourse through which Jeremy Corbyn was framed as an ‘authentic’ leader in the British press during the 2015 Labour party leadership contest. We use an ethnomethodological approach to the study of media texts to investigate the methods used by journalists and commentators to establish authenticity. Our analysis uncovers three methods that were used to establish Corbyn's authenticity: consistency, atypicality and commitment to beliefs.

This marginalization is especially visible in the field of fashion, since mainstream fashion media promotes thinness as the bodily ideal for women. However, the field of fashion is slowly but surely becoming more diverse in its representation of beauty. Fashion blogs, along with other social media platforms, are instrumental to these changes. Through blogging, plus-size women can actively participate in constructing new fashion discourses, as well as forming communities around their shared interest in fashion. One way of reconstructing the hegemonic discourses built around fashion and being plus-size is the reappropriation of words used to describe the plus-size body, such as “fat”. In this article, I apply corpus-linguistic methodology to investigate the role of body descriptors in twenty UK-based, plus-size fashion blogs. The frequency and distribution of forty-five terms that are used to describe a plus-size woman's body in a self-compiled blog corpus are discussed alongside qualitative examples from blog texts. The results of the study reveal the variety within the genre of plus-size fashion blogs: fat acceptance activism influenced bloggers use certain body descriptors more than bloggers who focus on fashion trends and personal style. The study highlights the importance of combining qualitative and quantitative methods in research on online communities. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Community of practice; Corpus linguistics; Fashion blogging; Fat acceptance movement; Identity; Marginalization; Online community",,,,,,"Suomen Kulttuurirahasto, SKR

It seeks to relate the ideological and cognitive aspects of promoting home design to the verbalised materiality of the design as reflected in the catalogue. Doing so, the paper adopts a pragma-cognitive approach to trace the verbalised tempo-spatialities of IKEA design. The cognitive analysis is approached from a pragmatic lens, relying on the use of performatives and their lexicalized predicates (Condoravdi and Lauer's, 2011; Austin, 1962). The paper also synthesizes the Bakhtinian Chronotope (1981) with Multimodal Conceptual Metaphor (Forceville and Urios-Aparisi, 2009). Bakhtin's the chronotope is used to examine the inter-connectedness of temporal and spatial relationships depicted in IKEA catalogue to better understand the kinds of identities and values cognitively conveyed. Synthesizing Conceptual Metaphors with the chronotope is meant to define the paradigms of the spatial cognitive experience and materiality of IKEA home design while relating it to the logic of neoliberalism. Findings are in the connection between neoliberalism, both in its utopian and contradictory versions, and IKEA design options. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Dichotomous neoliberalism; IKEA design; Multimodal metaphors; Performatives; Pragmatics; Spatial cognition; Speech acts'lexicalization; The Bakhtinian chronotope",,,,,,,,,"Austin, J.L., How to Do Things with Words (1962), Clarendon Oxford; Bakhtin, M., (1981), The Dialogic Imagination.

Noted for their ability to create meaning across linguistic boundaries, emoji are strongly associated with informal interaction where they serve to build and maintain social bonds. Following in the footsteps of Zappavigna (2011, 2015, 2018) I use a social semiotic approach to analyze how the celebrity, Cher, creates meaning across the strata of discourse and builds affinity with her followers through the use of the toilet emoji in relation to Donald Trump. The approach is successful at elucidating the complex layers of meaning which a single emoji can enact, providing further evidence of the value of the social semiotic approach in the context of global media. The affinity that is created by the toilet emoji can be understood through attitude-ideation couplings, where the coupling is made more 'bondable' to her ambient audience through the system of promotion. The possibility of an emoji enacting both attitude and ideation in a coupling is suggested and implications for how we understand certain semiotic choices discussed. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Affiliation; Emoji; Multimodal discourse analysis; Multimodality; Social semiotics; Twitter",,,,,,,,,"Adami, E., Retwitting, reposting, repinning: Reshaping identities online: Towards a social semiotic multimodal analysis of digital remediation (2014) LEA - Lingue e Letterature d'Oriente e d'Occidente, 3, pp. 223-243; Bednarek, M., Corpus Linguistics and Systemic Functional Linguistics: Interpersonal meaning, identity and bonding in popular culture (2010) New discourse on language: Functional perspectives on multimodality, identity, and affiliation, pp. 237-266. , M.

Spanning a range of intersecting identities – he is white, male, disabled, a sports champion and a convicted murderer – Pistorius presents an important case to study. In this paper, we focus on the period from his success in the 2012 London Olympics to his 'fall from grace' after fatally shooting his girlfriend in 2013. We use a combination of corpus linguistic tools and methods, and Critical Discourse Analysis, to interrogate corpora of press articles published in major British and South African newspapers. Investigating collocational patterns surrounding Pistorius, we show how media ‘mix and match’ aspects of his identity to construct a particular kind of persona. Whereas his disability and (trans)national identity are foregrounded in constructing him as a sports hero, his new emotionality and mental vulnerability are emphasized through gendered representations in the UK while a largely individual representation dominates in South Africa, where he is referred to overwhelmingly by name and in terms of his crime as an amputee, and only obliquely as white and male. At the theoretical level, our study adds to the body of research which challenges the notion that individual experience can be understood by categorising people in terms of one identity component (gender, race, ethnicity). More importantly, it shows that different aspects of identities are foregrounded or backgrounded to navigate shifts in salience in sometimes conflicting identity/ies, and that this is accomplished differently in two different media traditions. At the methodological level, this study shows the potential of a diachronic collocational analysis to unravel patterns of intersectionality in mediatised identity constructions. © 2019","Corpus linguistics; Disability; Gender; Intersectionality; Oscar Pistorius; Race; South African media; Sport reporting; UK media",,,,,,"108961

The aim of this study is to examine the discursive construction of risk in an official federal Australian government video advertisement. Specifically, in the context of the large Operation Sovereign Border campaign, we use multimodal discourse analysis to show ways that seeks to deter irregular maritime arrival. Consistent with the social theories, our findings identify the discourse of governmentality to stress the role of individual self-regulation as well as technico-scientific discourse to highlight the value of expertise in controlling risk. Results of the study contribute to the use of multimodal discourse analysis in examining risk discourse within contemporary political contexts. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Australia; Construction of risk; Irregular maritime migration; Multimodal discourse analysis; Operation Sovereign Borders",,,,,,,,,"ABF, T.V., English - No change to Australia's boat turn back policy [video file] (2016), https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ft7PsAyxti4, Retrieved from; Baram, M., Risk communication: moving from theory to law to practice (1989) Effective Risk Communication: The Role and Responsibility of Government and Nongovernment Organizations, pp. 37-43. , V.T.

Looking at differing standards for kanji and hiragana use throughout the dialogue in three Japanese manga (comics), the study examines the contexts where kanji-absent, kanji-light, and locally unmarked orthographic styles are used, modified, or abandoned in each text to identify the specific contexts that motivate each local orthographic style. For two of the manga, supplementary data is provided by an interview with the author. The findings show that while all three authors use kanji and hiragana in ways that reflect the scripts’ respective links to adults and children, the conventions serve to index features the author treats as defining of particular identities rather than character age. Furthermore, comparison of the orthographic practices across the three manga shows each author putting their own mark on broadly recognized orthographic styles, and in doing so participating in the maintenance, circulation, and development of language ideologies rather than just images of each script. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Indexicality; Japanese script; Language ideology; Manga",,,,,,,,,"Agha, A., The social life of cultural value (2003) Lang.

Colonial practices and discourses get recycled, involving the reperformance of long-standing hierarchies, especially those that are ethnic, racial, and gender-based. In the case of the Zika emergency, these discourses travelled worldwide. In this paper, I explore the performativity of such circulation, by singling out two modes of discourse transit. The first one, termed ‘biomedical authority model’ by Briggs and Hallin (2016), conceives of health texts as mediatized expandable objects that move as unified static structures, as if they were solid blocks. The second mode, contrastively, displays flowing intensity and potential for change. Inspired by Massumi (2002), I term it ‘affective mode’. Upon investigating their performative effects, I delve into the friction between an insidious colonialist-modernist episteme and intensified transformational possibilities. The former projects specific groups as responsible for the spread of Zika. It does so by exploring the intersectionality of gender, race, ethnicity, social class, and nationality. In a rather distinct movement, the latter approaches intersubjectivity as being always intersectionally enacted, thus escaping any kind of causal determinism. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","(De)colonial thinking; Affect; Biomediatization; Discourse circulation; Intersectionality",,,,,,,,,"(2016), http://www.clam.org.br/destaque/conteudo.asp?cod=12403, Amarrillo, C.R.

On one hand, Zionism was motivated by a desire to create a new category of Jewish personhood that would be distinct from its European counterpart. Yet, on the other hand, normative Israeli identity has never been conceptualised as a fully “Middle Eastern” category. Rather, cultural and historical links to Europe have been strategically deployed to sustain and legitimate pervasive systems of social stratification and marginalisation that exist both within Jewish Israeli communities as well as between Jewish Israelis and Palestinians. In this paper, we describe how Arisa, a queer Israeli music group, critiques this dominant Eurocentric imagining of Israeli identity. Drawing on developments in the study of mediatised performance, we examine a promotional music video that Arisa released in 2014. We illustrate how in the video Arisa parodies normative conceptualisations of Israeli authenticity and the gendered, sexual and ethnic stereotypes that undergird them. At the same time, we demonstrate how Arisa's critique functions by reinscribing tropes of (Jewish) Israeli exceptionalism, thus feeding into dominant discourses of Israeli homonationalism. In the paper, we discuss the complex intersections between these two aspects of Arisa's performance as they relate to the politics of mediatised performance more generally. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Ethnicity; Israel; Media; Parody; Performance; Zionism",,,,,,,,,"Agha, A., Language and Social Relations (2007), Cambridge University Press Cambridge; Agha, A., Commodity registers (2011) J.

The analysis brings together corpus-assisted Critical Discourse Analysis and Cognitive Linguistics to explore the semantic configuration of the lemma and the relationship between lexical meanings and social ideologies. Results show that in contemporary Spain, emigra* cannot simply be defined in terms of an outward population displacement, but has additional attributes derived from a shared socio-cognitive understanding of the lemma. Thus, the semantic prototype of emigra* presents emigrants as victims forced to leave their homeland because of economic reasons. Present-day Spanish emigrants, however, show additional semantic attributes that place them as peripheral members of the lexical category. Results also show that such cognitive configuration of the lemma is closely linked to different social perspectives on Spanish emigration, and provides evidence of the role media discourse has in the creation of shared socio-cognitive meanings. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Cognitive linguistics; Critical discourse studies; Emigration; Media; Socio-cognitive approach; Spanish",,,,,,,,,"Alcalde, R., Petroff, A., Alarcón, A., Cavalcanti, L., Una propuesta de estudio de las migraciones cualificadas contemporáneas desde España hacia los EE.

Using Foucauldian discourse analysis, a sample of 806 online e-magazine articles published between 2015 and 2018 were systematically studied. The construction does not only grant primacy to the leader, but also it obscures followers and other secondary social actors. The study contributes to existing literature on leadership representation, leadership stakeholders involved in such discursive process, and their routine practices of writing leadership texts that legitimize certain meanings at the expense of others. The paper suggests that such a construction of leadership in the business media impacts both followers’ and aspiring leaders’ perceptions, ultimately limiting what can be envisioned and enacted. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",,,,,,,,,,"Aaldering, L., Vliegenthart, R., Political leaders and the media.

By analysing more than one thousand tokens of forms that illustrate what appears as reversed Romanization (i.e. English-related forms written with Greek characters, engreek), the study aims to discover, first, how these forms are created and, second, for what purposes, and for whom, they are mobilised at given moments. In order to address these questions, I propose a translanguaging lens for the study of multilingual digital writing and draw on the notion of trans-scripting as key for understanding such writing practices as creative and performative. My findings reveal that there is a link between trans-scripting as a creative practice and digital orality, as users orient primarily to phonetic respellings of the English-related forms and associate such spellings with particular forms of stylized speech and social personas. The paper concludes with a critical discussion of the study's implications to research on the role of English as a resource for multilingual writing and current debates about language diversity and fluidity in the digital mediascape. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Creativity; Engreek; Multilingual writing; Orality; Trans-scripting; Translanguaging",,,,,,,,,"Androutsopoulos, J., Introduction: sociolinguistics and computer-mediated communication (2006) J.

It was a time when a heightened level of anxiety was accompanied by mistrust toward “official” information disseminated in the mainstream media that required highly technical scientific knowledge to interpret. This paper draws on systemic functional linguistics (SFL), in which community is conceptualized in terms of patterns of “couplings” of ideational and interpersonal meanings, to carry out an analysis of the linguistic choices through which these different communities that formed during crisis shaped themselves. In one community, a focus on knowledge was dominant, while in the other a focus on values was dominant.

By examining the recontextualization of the talk scandal in on-line news articles, it is shown that the original speech event gives rise to other speech events related to it, creating a ‘talk scandal universe’. Viewing talk scandals as building blocks upon which engaging media narratives are built, it is argued that they can serve as communicative resources in far-right populist performances, enacting a clean break with established norms and values of the political establishment. Moreover, talk scandals project perpetrators as candid, outspoken and defiant of the status quo, even in the face of damaging face or suffering legal penalties. Finally, as scandalous utterances and subsequent retractions contain political positioning statements, talk scandals in effect help spread and reproduce populist agendas. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Far-right populist discourse; Mediatization; Political discourse; Recontextualization; Talk scandals",,,,,,"VetenskapsrÃ¥det, VR","This paper was produced as part of an international research project funded by the Swedish Research Council .

However, while there are diversified academic conceptualizations of the term, its vernacular and public uses were hardly studied. The present study aims at addressing this lacuna, by exploring the inductive meanings and functions of ‘populism’ in Israeli mediated political discourse. To this end, we combined quantitative and qualitative analysis of the reference and linguistic context of a sample of 500 occurrences of ‘populism’, ‘populist’ and their inflections in major news outlets during 2012–2017; and detailed discourse analysis of their uses as a meta-discursive resource for positioning in mediated political talk during 2016–2017. Our findings suggest that political actors add a moral-evaluative layer to former conceptualizations of ‘populism’, and associate it with cynicism and inauthenticity – thus reversing and problematizing populist discourse. We found that ‘populism’ is a highly flexible and multi-functional positioning resource. It is used in all modes of self-, other-, present and non-present positioning, and strategically employed to challenge antagonists, defend oneself against challenges, manage political images, control the topical agenda of interviews or ensure quotability and news and entertainment values. Such uses reflect the dialogicity and self-reflexivity of contemporary political face management, and tensions between conflicting journalistic normative frameworks and professional practices. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Authenticity; Face management; Meta-discourse; Political interviews; Populism; Positioning",,,,,,,,,"Antaki, C., Leudar, I., Recruiting the record: using opponents' exact words in parliamentary argumentation (2001) Text, 21 (4), pp. 467-488; Atkinson, M., Our masters’ Voices (1984), London, Methuen; Bale, T., Van Kessel, S., Taggart, P., Thrown around with abandon?

The study applies critical multimodal analysis to examine with what communicative strategies the state-owned operator positions itself on the soon-to-be de-regulated Swedish gambling market. The focus in the analysis lies on the linguistic and visual choices used to achieve certain communicative goals in relation to the consumer. The results show that nationalistic and patriotic values are conveyed and used in order to connect to an implied male consumer who is both ‘Swedish’ and of multi-ethnic origin; the latter being positioned as an Other in need of being taught about the Swedish values of fairness, trustworthiness and authenticity. Deleted from the advertisement is anything having to do with gambling as a social practice. Svenska Spel's identity is visually and linguistically converted from that of a gambling company into a philanthropist whose business quite unproblematically gain society and its “Swedish” people. The study raises questions regarding demands for “moderate” gambling advertisements, and suggests that current moderation regulations miss the mark when it comes to identifying and regulating problematic ideological content in seemingly inconspicuously designed gambling advertising. © 2020 The Author","Critical discourse analysis; Gambling advertisement; Ideology; Moderation; Social practice; Svenska Spel",,,,,,,,,"Arvidsson, M., Sjöstrand, J., Stage, J., The economics of the Swedish online gambling market (2017) Appl.

Our data set consists of a sample of public awareness campaigns that were published by the Polish National Bureau for Drug Prevention between the year 2000 and 2015. Based upon Laclau and Mouffe's discourse theory, as well as Herschinger's concept of ‘strategy’, four strategies of exclusion were identified: (1) silencing the addict, (2) constructing an idealised role model, (3) creating binary oppositions and (4) pairing closeness with control. Addiction is shown to be understood as a highly anti-modern phenomenon that prevents addicts from full participation in modern society and serves both as a tool of exclusion and a basis for institutional intervention and surveillance. We argue that these strategies are modernity's way of maintaining hegemony, obscuring its possible role in creating the addict and marginalising alternative discourses. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Addiction; Discourse analysis; Modernity; Public service announcements; Strategies of exclusion",,,,,,,,,"Abucewicz, M., Narkomania-problem społeczny w perspektywie konstruktywistycznej (2012), Uniwersytet Warszawski, Instytut Profilaktyki Społecznej i Resocjalizacji Warszawa; Berger, P., Luckmann, T., The Social Construction of Reality.

We show how age categories are used to link actions and identity categories and how participants use the standardized relational pair ‘mother-child’ as a justification to moralize. The paper argues that the fact that participants may only have highly limited visual access to co-participants and the fact that participants do not know their co-participants in advance is what makes the use of age and stage of life categorizations to moralize on the conduct of others noteworthy. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",,,,,,,,,,"Andersen, E.M., What's Your Problem?: On How Participants Understand and Deal with Experienced Bodily Problems in an Online Discussion Forum About Metabolism: A Contribution to Micro-analytic Research that Investigate Online Data (2015), University of Southern Denmark Odense Unpublished PhD dissertation; Button, G., Ethnomethodology and the Human Sciences (1991), Cambridge University Press Cambridge; Georgalou, M., Beyond the timeline: Constructing time and age identities on Facebook (2015) Discourse, Context & Media, 9, pp. 24-33; Goffman, E., Forms of Talk (1981), Basil Blackwell Oxford; Herring, S., Stein, D., Virtanen, T., Pragmatics of Computer-Mediated Communication (2013), Walter de Gruyter Berlin; Housley, W., Moral Discrepancy and fudging the issue'in a radio news interview (2002) Sociology, 36 (1), pp. 5-21; Housley, W., Fitzgerald, R., The reconsidered model of membership categorization analysis (2002) Qualitative Res., 2 (1), pp. 59-83; Housley, W., Fitzgerald, R., Membership categorization, culture and norms in action (2009) Discourse Soc., 20 (3), pp. 345-362; Jayyusi, L., Values and moral judgement (1991) Ethnomethodology and the Human Sciences, pp. 227-251. , G.

Adopting the perspective of multimodal critical discourse analysis, it demonstrates how a series of images can construct, in combination with the textual component in image captions, a coherent and self-contained narrative reflecting a shared stereotypical script. The articles argues that the traditional exploration of text-image relations in the press should be extended by considering the storytelling potential of sequenced images in view of the fact that such images can manifest subtle patterns of multimodal manipulation. The implications of this study are relevant for our understanding of the semiotic potential of sequenced images in news stories, as distinct from the genre of print or online picture galleries, and of how such storytelling contributes towards articulating discourses of prejudice. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Anti-immigration discourse; News discourse; Othering; Photojournalism; Prejudicial discourse; Roma; Visual/multimodal analysis",,,,,,,"This paper was supported by the research grant GA16-05484S “ Discursive construction of otherness in medial and post-medial spaces ”.",,"Abid, R.Z., Manan, S.A., Rahman, Z.A.A.A., ‘A flood of Syrians has slowed to a trickle’: the use of metaphors in the representation of Syrian refugees in the online media news reports of host and non-host countries (2017) Discour.

While some scholars have focused on the potential effects these ads have on healthcare, this study takes a critical approach to the ways in which the language used in these ads position viewers as ‘patient-consumers’ within the neoliberal paradigm. Using a framework of critical discourse analysis, I analyze 15 DTCAs and highlight the specific ways in which medical neoliberalism is reproduced in these ads, focusing specifically on how viewers are positioned as the primary agent for their health through a series of imperatives. In addition to interpellating the viewer as the ‘patient consumer,’ many of the ads also employ a strategy of presenting characters who represent the ideal ‘patient consumer,’ whom viewers are encouraged to emulate. While this may seem to be a positive move in terms of activating patients, it can set up a false expectation of personal autonomy for patients, often minimizing the role that medical providers play in determining the best course of treatment for a particular patient. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",,,,,,,,,,"Adams, C., Harder, B.H., Diet, exercise…and drugs: social constructions of healthy lifestyles in weight-related prescription drug advertisements (2017) Critical Public Health, 28 (4), pp. 439-449; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaZuO9488uI, [Ad Obsession].

Focus was on the synergetic wielding of ideologies and identities as persuasive strategies by candidates and political parties. Analysing both verbal and non-verbal texts, we observe differences in the driving ideologies of the two parties. The Peoples’ Democratic Party (PDP) anchors their campaigns on progressivism alongside two identities: progressivist and achiever identities. The All Progressives Congress’ (APC) driving ideology is reformism, through which the reformist and rescuer identities are portrayed.

Frames and news values (or ‘journalistic selection procedures’) make it more intelligible, foregrounding salient elements. Giving shape to reality, both concepts cannot be separated from ideological interests, either. Previous research suggests, accordingly, that frames and newsworthiness take shape in mutual interaction. Yet, the exact nature of this interaction remains unclear as in-depth discursive research is lacking. Therefore, we have conducted a combined framing-news value analysis, drawing on a corpus of climate articles published in three mainstream and two alternative media outlets in Northern Belgium. This article discusses the relations among four selected news values and the ideologically coloured subframes of the Cycles of Nature and Environmental Justice frames. The presented schemata and exemplary analyses demonstrate the strong overlap between the salience-enhancing devices of subframes and news values. Also, they make tangible the ideological argumentations at the intersection of newsworthiness and framing, explicating the diverging realizations of news values in the context of various subframes. As such, this study lays bare some of the journalistic conventions which are often used in climate reporting to naturalize certain worldviews.

Unlike earlier, monomodal accounts of selfies, the framework accounts for the visual, aural and verbal resources that are used in video-sharing. The analysis focuses on the videos and photos that are produced and consumed in the Featured Stories of Snapchat as collective accounts of public events of different kinds. The results show that, in Snapchat, constructing group identities is prominent, both in selfies and quasi-selfies. This reflects a discourse of ‘us-ness’ current in many forms of social media, and which prizes particular forms of sociality. The uses of this discourse are ideologically charged, and include the strategic use of synthetic collectivisation as an emerging form of audio-visual communication which contrives to position the individual member of the audience as if they were part of a larger group, sharing the same experience and perspective as the person creating the video. The framework is used in this paper to examine the ways in which the collective identities of fans, mourners and protestors are constructed in Featured Stories from Snapchat, but is of relevance to many other forms of multimodal communication that are shared through social media sites and services. © 2018","Selfies; Snapchat; Sociality; Synthetic collectivisation",,,,,,,,,"Abidin, C., “Aren't these just young, rich women doing vain things online?” Influencer selfies as subversive frivolity (2016) Soc.

Informed by the works of Martin and White (2005) and Economou (2009, 2008) on Appraisal Theory and evaluative stance, the current paper identifies the visual evaluative resources in Reuters’ Pulitzer-winning photos of refugees and migrants’ crisis in Europe for the year 2016. When considering photos evaluative stance, this paper argues, news photos should not be merely viewed as witness or proof of the events, rather they should be acknowledged for their aesthetic properties and compositional perspectives. This marks the importance of introducing delicate refinements to Martin and White's (2005) APPRECIATION model by adding, replacing and removing subcategories to account for the range of visual resources deployed in the photos under discussion. Photos’ visual cues and semiotics codes are added to the APPRECIATION model. Doing so, a distinction between the evaluative stances infused by photos aesthetical properties and those arising from photos'content and the depicted participants is established. Two authorial voices are then proposed: the Witness voice and the Artist voice. The delicate modifications introduced to the APPRECIATION model helps to dig deep into the embedded evaluative stance of the photos. Applying the suggested APPRECIATION resources, it is found that Pulitzer-winning photos aestheticize the suffering of the refugees and render it beautiful and photogenic. However, the evoked positive APPRECIATION resources instantiate negative JUDGEMENT values of social exclusion, impersonalization, and Otherness. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Aesthetic values; Appraisal; Pulitzer prize; Refugees’ crisis; Semiotic codes; Semiotics; Visual evaluative stance",,,,,,,,,"Altengarten, J., (2004), http://photoinf.com/Golden_Mean/Jim_Altengarten/Creativity_and_the_Rule_of_Thirds.htm, Creativity and the rule of thirds (Photo composition articles).

Data for the study comprise advocacy texts that touch on anti-corruption crusade, entrenchment of democratic values and security of lives and properties. The data were drawn from speeches and jingles circulated by institutional agencies on television and radio stations and covered the period July 2013 to July 2018. The five-year span was informed by the wide gamut of negative realities in the nation at the time frame which led to increased mediatisation of social transformation messages in the nation. Fairclough's (2015) dialectical relational approach constitutes the theoretical anchor for the study. Data analysis reveals that the discourse participants deploy framing, legitimation, rhetorical questions, linguistic nativism, metaphorisation of social transformation acts and accentuation of the repercussions of negative actions. The paper concludes that even though the discourse of social transformation in Nigeria is hinged on the desire to impact the society, it also reflects the power disequilibrium in the society which privileges the government and reflects in the construction of Nigeriás problems and its solutions as citizen-oriented. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Advocacy; Critical discourse analysis; Discursive strategies; Mediatisation; Nigeria; Social transformation",,,,,,,,,"Adedimeji, M., (2005), http://www.unilorin.edu.ng/publications/ADEDIMEJI/THE UNIFYING ROLE OF ENGLISH IN A MULTILINGUAL NATION.htm, The unifying role of English in a multilingual nation: The case of Nigeria.

Nonetheless, there is a scarcity of research that has explored pragmatic strategies and rapport management in responses to such reviews. In view of this gap, this study reports on an examination of relational acts in Chinese management responses to online consumer reviews, based on an extensive analysis of 220 items of management responses collected from two leading Chinese e-commerce websites. The study identified 14 relational acts and results showed that despite similarities, review valence (positive vs. negative) played a critical role in the retailer's employment of relational acts for the rapport management purpose. The findings and practical implications furnish timely and much-needed evidence to the pragmatic investigation into the genre of management response, particularly in languages other than English. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Management responses; Online consumer reviews; Rapport management; Relational act",,,,,,"Shanxi Scholarship Council of China, SXSCC: 2017-006","This study was supported by the Research Project Supported by Shanxi Scholarship Council of China ( 2017-006 ).

They are intimately related to the assigning of blame and to the alleged perpetrator's concomitant denial of wrongdoing. While public denunciations are not a new phenomenon, what has arguably changed in recent years is the loosening of strictures on publicly denouncing immoral behavior, even when (alleged) moral transgressions happen within the remit of traditionally conceived intimate or private relationships, and the broadening of what counts as a public figure. The aim of this paper is to interrogate this moral turn in public life by examining how public denunciations are accomplished in broadcast talk, and the role they play in co-constructing and reaffirming perceived common moral ground. We conclude that while moral criticisms, such as accusing, blaming, denouncing, reproaching, and so on, are evidently oriented as sensitive actions in the public sphere, it appears that constraints on publicly denouncing immoral behavior are on the wane. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Blame; Broadcast talk; Denunciation; Ethnomethodological conversation analysis; Moral order; Morality; Sociopragmatics",,,,,,,,,"Abell, J., Stokoe, E., I take full responsibility, I take some responsibility, I'll take half of it but no more than that’: Princess Diana and the negotiation of blame in the ‘Panorama’ interview (1999) Discourse Stud., 1 (3), pp. 297-319; Adut, A., On Scandal: Moral Disturbances in Society (2008), Cambridge University Press Cambridge; Atkinson, J.M., Drew, P., Order in Court: The Organisation of Verbal Interaction in Judicial Settings (1979), Macmillan London; Augoustinos, M., Every, E., Accusations and denials of racism: managing moral accountability in public discourse (2010) Discourse Soc., 21 (3), pp. 251-256; Beach, W., Avoiding ownership for alleged wrongdoings (1990) Res.

According to Gibson (2018), the endless reflexivity of late modernity and a loss of faith in institutions interactively give rise to a ‘post-truth double helix’. Facts are reduced to ideological claims to be discursively contested, giving rise to such notions as ‘true facts’ and ‘alternative facts’. The features of the online media environment further accelerate this dynamic. Journalism – as one of the traditionally authoritative institutions – plays a leading part in this spiral of dwindling trust. The perspectivist view on journalism increasingly has led audiences and journalists themselves to believe that there are no facts but only interpretations. Nevertheless, many journalists are still driven by the objectivity ideal which has traditionally sustained their authority as ‘truth-speakers’ (Tuchman, 1978). Others, however, call for transparency and multiperspectivalism (Gans, 2011) in order to limit inaccuracy and distortion as much as possible. This special issue of Discourse, Context & Media brings together a number of contributions exploring the discursive relation between political communication, news media and factuality. Mapping the eroding trust in true facts and the strategies of participants to deal with this ‘post-truth era’ this kind of research can provide valuable insights into evolutions which have a profound impact on every citizen, and democracy at large. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","(Discursive) construction; Journalism culture; Political communication; Post-truth; Social media",,,,,,,,,"Allcott, H., Gentzkow, M., Social media and fake news in the 2016 election (2017) J.

Facebook's influence as a channel for the circulation of news has come under intense scrutiny recently, especially with regard to the dissemination of false stories. While this criticism has focused on the ‘filter bubbles’ created by the site's personalisation algorithms, our research indicates that users’ own actions also play a key role in how the site operates as a forum for debate. Our findings show that the strategies people use to navigate the complex social space contribute to the polarising of debate, as they seek to avoid conflict with the diverse members of their network. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Context design; Facebook; Filter bubbles; Intradiversity; Media ideologies",,,,,,,,,"Androutsopoulos, J., Languaging when contexts collapse: audience design in social networking (2014) DiscourseContext Media, 4-5, pp. 62-73; Androutsopoulos, J., Juffermans, K., Digital language practices in superdiversity: introduction (2014) Discourse Context Media, 4-5, pp. 7-18; Androutsopoulos, J., Staehr, A., Moving methods online: researching digital language practices (2017) The Routledge Handbook of Language and Superdiversity, , A.

Four published studies are reviewed, based on two specific journalistic contexts: broadcast political interviews (Bull, 2003; Bull and Elliott, 1998; Elliott and Bull, 1996), and news bulletins (Bull et al., 2014). In addition, a further illustrative example is presented, based on a previously unpublished analysis of a television interview with the current British Prime Minister (PM), Theresa May. In the study of the television news, editing techniques of de-contextualization and re-contextualization are identified and discussed in the context of interpretive journalism. All the analyses of interviews are focused specifically on how equivocal responses by politicians occur in response to interviewer questions, which create communicative conflicts through threats to face. From this perspective, equivocal and evasive discourse in political interviews needs to be understood in the broader context of questioning techniques as utilised by political journalists, not simply ascribed to the intrinsic slipperiness of individual politicians. Hence, these studies are of particular relevance to one of the main themes of this special issue, to “journalistic ways of contesting and reclaiming representations of facts”. © 2018","De-contextualization; Equivocation; Microanalysis; News broadcasts; Political interviews; Re-contextualization",,,,,,,,,"Alfahad, A., Equivocation in Arabic news interviews (2016) J.

During the summer of 2015, the intense media focus on the so-called ‘Mediterranean migrant crisis’ also led to heated terminological debate in certain sections of the international press. This debate centred not only on semantic questions, but also raised ideological issues since the terminology used to describe social groups almost certainly has social implications: the discursive construction of people ‘on the move’ may lead not only to the formation of stereotypical social representations but also, ultimately, to different treatment of different groups of people in ‘host’ countries. Using a methodology which combines CDA and frame analysis, this paper seeks to explore how different migration-related terms (i.e. immigrants, migrants, refugees) were used in the headlines of the Portuguese digital press around the time of the crisis, and what kind of representations of these social actors were being (re)constructed through these texts. We conclude that although there are some similarities with the findings of other studies set in different countries, namely the impersonalization, genericization and passivation of these social actors, there are also some differences which can be attributed to the socio- political context in which the Portuguese press is embedded. As a ‘peripheral’ European country which felt no direct impact from the unfolding humanitarian crisis, Portugal was clearly seeking to bolster a positive self-representation as a tolerant, welcoming and inclusive society. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Immigrants; Migrants; Portuguese digital press; Refugees; Social representations",,,,,,,,,"Aksakal, M., Schmidt-Verkerk, K., (2015), Conceptual framework on temporary migration: report on conceptual clarifications for the EURA-NET project.

Although human rights guarantees are often articulated as a matter of near-universal consensus, Belgium has been convicted 23 times by the European Court for Human Rights for its treatment of mentally disabled criminal offenders. Considering news media's central role in shaping debate on human rights issues, we study internment news in two Dutch-language newspapers between 2013 and 2015 using critical discourse analysis. Our research shows that studying media as a site of struggle enables a deeper understanding of how debate is opened or closed, and explores the possibilities of studying discursive strategies that shape the mediated debate together with practices that reinforce journalistic credibility. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Agonistic pluralism; Critical discourse analysis; Discursive strategies; Human rights; Internment; Journalistic practices; Media discourse; Newspapers; Performativity",,,,,,,,,"Broersma, M., (2010), Journalism as performative discourse.

The images resulted in a debate and shaped a serious discourse around the Middle Eastern refugee crises. However, the same image from different angle, was used by Daesh/ISIS (in Dabiq Magazine) to present a different kind of ‘reality’/ideology, signifying the possibility of depiction of diverging ideologies through identical images. This research adopts a Conceptual Analytical Approach blending the work of three of the 18th and 19th Century philosophers through their ideas of Genius, Fine Art, Tragedy and Pessimism. To this end, considering Kant, Schopenhauer and Nietzsche's philosophy of arts, this paper critically analyses the images in an effort to reinforce the significance of philosophical analysis in CVA, through deconstruction. In doing so, the article embraces a Logical Analytical Approach, overlaying these selected concepts on contemporary issue within broader refugee discourse. Integrating the contemporary social semiotic concepts with philosophical concepts signifies the need for such Integrative Analytical Approach. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",,,,,,,,,,"Adajian, T., (2016), The definition of art.

The aim is to answer the following research questions: Has the representation of maternity leave changed in the right-of-centre UK press with the adoption of new policies, particularly in relation to economic matters? If so, in what ways? Discussions of maternity leave in newspapers are identified by uses of the phrase maternity leave. Selected findings are presented from a corpus compiled for this study of news stories (641,996 words) in the Times and the Daily Mail, in the years in which maternity leave policies were changed in the UK (1973, 1975, 1999) plus two years before and after. Combining qualitative with quantitative methods, the analysis shows that maternity leave becomes monetized in the later period, from 1997 to 2001. The economic term that undergoes the most noticeable shift in frequency of use is afford, which is used five-times more frequently in the 1997–2001 period. A close reading of all those stories containing the term afford reveals considerable opposition in these newspapers to the introduction of new entitlements for women with new-borns, a hostility that was not apparent when improvements to maternity leave provisions were first introduced in the 1970s. This paper addresses the representation of maternity leave in the belief that this system benefit (like any other state-backed benefit in the UK system) helps in mitigating wealth inequality. It is part of a larger study exploring changes in the way in which British newspapers have represented wealth inequality in the UK from 1971 to the present. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Class; Corpus linguistics; Critical discourse analysis; Daily Mail; Economy; Inequality; Maternity leave; Newspaper discourse; Times; Wealth",,,,,,,,,"Anthony, L., (2018), http://www.laurenceanthony.net/, AntConc (Version 3.5.2) [Computer Software].

In order to determine the types of emojis used and the frequencies, I used what Herring (2004) describes as “coding and counting” in her description of computer-mediated discourses analysis. Then, I performed a qualitative analysis of selected extracts using theories and methods of interactional sociolinguistics. In line with studies such as Dresner and Herring (2010), the analysis of select, representative excerpts including various emojis demonstrates that emojis do not only serve as indicators of users’ emotions, but also serve many other communicative functions. They can serve as what Gumperz (1982) calls “contextualization cues”; indication of celebration; indication of approval of others’ messages; responses to expressions of thanks and compliments; conversational openings and closings; linking devices; and indication of the fulfillment of a requested task. In other words, emojis serve to create alignments between participants, structure interactive exchanges, and indicate message tone. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Arabic computer-mediated discourse; Computer-mediated discourse; Emojis; WhatsApp",,,,,,,,,"(2017), http://www.omanobserver.om/whatsapp-omans-top-app-women-swear-instagram/, Al Abri, M.

In contrast to semiotic approaches to emoji that focus on their cultural signification, or that treat them as reflections of users’ inner intensions, we analyse emoji as communication phenomena by exploring their relation to other textual actions in the production of text-talk. The emoji analysed here functioned as a laughter token, and performed specific interactional work related to laughter. We conclude that conversation analysis offers an important corrective to abstracted semiotic analysis and a useful resource for exploring the demonstrable meaning of emoji for interlocutors. However, we also emphasise the importance of capturing the process of composing messages, the challenges of dealing with the variety of forms that emoji take and their relation to gestural and other actions in face to face communication. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Conversation analysis; Emoji; Semiotics; Speech act theory",,,,,,"Beijing Normal University, BNU","This research was part of a project funded by the Advanced Innovation Centre for Future Education, Beijing Normal University.",,"Alshenqeeti, H., Are emojis creating a new or old visual language for new generations ?

It suggests that metaphors not only may operate as frames in themselves, but they can also combine in hierarchies of metaphoric frames which together co-construct superordinate metaphoric or non-metaphoric frames. Using insights from theory on mixed metaphor, metaphor hierarchies and scenarios, the article introduces the new concept “metaphoric frame networks” to explain interconnections and relationships between frames and metaphors within the same texts, which could at first appear to be unrelated. The article proposes a set of criteria by which a metaphoric frame network can be defined and distinguished from simpler frames. The argument of the article is then illustrated through an empirical analysis of the process frame in television coverage of the 2015 Catalan regional election. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",,,,,,,"Ministerio de EconomÃ­a y Competitividad, MINECO: CAS15/00122, CSO2013-41661-P","Marta Montagut’s contribution to this research was supported by the Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad of Spain, Ref.

Weibo, as a platform of this type, has been attracting growing attention in the fields of political communication and media studies in recent years. This study takes a discourse approach to explore resistance on Weibo by drawing upon a case study of the 2015 Tianjin explosions. Based on a discourse analysis of 1322 microblogs immediately following the explosions, this study unravels the details and dynamics of how Weibo users challenge the official discourse and offer an alternative discourse of the disaster online. It identifies three discursive strategies of resistance in Weibo: (a) resisting by quoting cross-platform witness accounts; (b) resisting by creating rumors; (c) resisting by ridiculing the official discourse through satire. These strategies of resistance exemplify how Chinese netizens actively use social media platforms to express sociopolitical arguments in non-democratic contexts, and in turn, reshape the power relations between the state and the public. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Discourse analysis; Resistance; Rumor; Satire; The 2015 Tianjin explosions; Weibo; Witness accounts",,,,,,,,,"Allan, S., Histories of citizen journalism (2009) Citizen journalism: Global perspectives, 1, pp. 17-32. , S.

Research also shows that people with bilingual and bicultural competency can flexibly change their language use patterns in response to different cultural contexts (Canagarajah, 2013). In this paper, we studied compliment response patterns of the same Chinese-English bilinguals in two highly popular social networking platforms (Facebook and Renren). Results showed that while Renren and Facebook are two technically similar platforms, Chinese-English bilingual users who are members of both online cultures flexibly switched and adapted their compliment response patterns in response to the online community in which they were participating. The Chinese-English bilinguals’ compliment response patterns were aligned with modesty principles more when they participated in Renren community, and less so when they participated in the Facebook community. Conversely, their compliment response patterns on Facebook were aligned with agreement principle more, and less so when they participated in Renren community. Our findings support that the linkage between language and culture are immutable even in a virtual context, and that bilinguals, who are members of both Renren and Facebook, change their compliment response patterns in response to the online community in which they are participating. The study has both theoretical and methodological significance. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Bicultural; Chinese-English bilinguals; Compliment response; Facebook; Renren; Social networking sites",,,,,,,,,"Bell, D., An introduction to cybercultures (2001), Routledge New York; Boyd, D.M., Ellison, N.B., (2007), http://jcmc.indiana.edu/vol13/issue1/boyd, Social network sites: definition, history, and scholarship.

In the process of the examination, the notions of face and facework from interactional linguistics are utilized and further defined. It is found that impression management by these global corporations on social media is characterized by duality of facework: on one hand, global brands promote their corporate assets, as evidenced in the use of speech acts such as disclosing corporate information and broadcasting corporate products and campaigns; on the other hand, they build solidarity with their followers, as evidenced in the use of speech acts such as greeting, directing, expressing, sharing, and retweeting. Finally, the study points to the emergence of a global culture on social media and concludes with a glocalization perspective for further studies of corporate communication practice in the age of digitalization. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Facework; Global corporate practice; Glocalization; Social media",,,,,,"4-ZZFB","This work was supported by RGC Directly Allocated Research Grant, Hong Kong (#4-ZZFB).",,"Arundale, R.B., Relating (2010) Interpersonal Pragmatics, pp. 137-166. , M.A. Locher S.L.

In our definition, this phenomenon covers an apology performed in front of public, and which is ritual in the sense that it is symbolic and expected to restore the moral order of the public, rather than grant actual reconciliation between the apologiser and the offended party. Thus, ‘public ritual apology’ usually occurs in contexts when someone apologises for acts that are deemed as grave and in the case of which apology is seemingly dysfunctional in the sense that it cannot usually grant forgiveness. Public ritual apology is a regretfully neglected area, in spite of the fact that such apologies are not only frequent but also generate significant public attention in media – thus, this paper fills an important knowledge gap. In our paper we focus on Chinese public ritual apologies, which are noteworthy to explore as Chinese is stereotypically referred to as a culture which disprefers apologising behaviour. Our methodology is predominantly interactional and metapragmatic, and it combines qualitative research with quantitative elements. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Apology; Media; Metapragmatics; Public; Ritual",,,,,,,,,"Bar-Siman-Tov, Y., (2004) From Conflict Resolution to Reconciliation, , Oxford University Press Oxford; Barkan, E., The Guilt of Nations: Restitution and Negotiating Injustices (2001), The John Hopkins University Press Baltimore; Bax, M., Epistolary presentation rituals: Face-work, politeness, and ritual display in early-modern Dutch letter writing (2010) Historical (Im)Politeness, pp. 37-86. , Jonathan Culpeper Dániel Z.

By focusing on the action types and language use in the status updates and personal profiles of ten college student users from China together with individual interviews, this study finds that microblog users employ a variety of strategies to construct their online identities, such as different action types; visual, enumerative, narrative and self-labelling practices; and different forms of internet language. The results also show that microblog users tend to use more implicit identity claims and strategically use language to construct situation-appropriate multiple identities, using identity rhetoric to achieve some communicative needs. The user, displayed friends and distant audiences triangulate to mould and portray their online identities on the Sina Microblog. The related factors that shape identity construction are described, and the implications of these findings are discussed. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Identity rhetoric; Internet language; Online identity; Sina Microblog; Speech acts",,,,,,"14BXW055","This work was supported by the State Social Science Fund, China (grant number: 14BXW055 ).",,"Andrejevic, M., (2004), Reality TV: The Work of Being Watched.

As a new genre, online reviews deserve more attention in language and discourse studies. Existing studies in this field predominantly investigate online reviews in English. More research on a greater variety of languages is needed to better understand the linguistic features of this genre and the localization of the social practice. In addition, how consumers mitigate their evaluations lacks systemic exploration. This study provides an analysis of mitigation strategies in Chinese consumer reviews, based on a dataset of user-generated online comments on Kindle E-Reader collected from Amazon China. The study examines the usage and frequency of different types of mitigation devices in the reviews. The distribution of mitigation is further investigated against the positive or negative nature of the comments. Since Chinese is a logographical language, exploring Chinese mitigation identified some particular usages. The study demonstrates that the investigation into mitigation in Chinese online consumer reviews could provide insights into cross-cultural differences in this genre. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Chinese; Mitigation; Online consumer review",,,,,,"15JJD740007","This study was supported by the MOE Project of Key Research Institute of Humanities and Social Sciences at Universities in P.R.

As a result, ordinary people have frequently participated in or even become the focus of news output. By following van Dijk's socio-cognitive approach of critical discourse analysis, this article examines how ordinary people are represented in China's news reports of social conflicts. The data include 106 news reports collected from the state-run websites of Xinhuanet and People's Network. Analytical results show that ordinary people have an either positive or negative representation in three relations constructed between ordinary people and government institutions, namely, antagonistic, jural and harmonious relations. It has also been found that journalists construct super-ordinate identities for ordinary people and represent them either positively as advocates of government policies or negatively as violators of social rules. The representation of both identities and relations of ordinary people is realized through both macro and micro discourse strategies. In essence, the complex representation of identities and relations is the result of the diversified ideologies underlying China's news reports. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Critical discourse analysis; Identity; Ideology; Ordinary people; Social conflicts; Socio-cognitive approach",,,,,,"YB135-5

Piastów 40B/5, Szczecin, 71-065, Poland","The paper considers the role of medical blogging practices in Poland, and more specifically, aims to explore the use of popularisation strategies in medical weblogs. Following recent approaches to the study of online communication in healthcare contexts that emphasise the importance of the interpersonal aspect, the study of blogging practices among Polish medical practitioners uses discourse analysis to examine healthcare practitioners’ professional identity via their engagement in popularisation. The qualitative analysis of the blog posts explores, and illustrates in detail, the popularisation strategies employed by healthcare practitioners. Healthcare practitioners effectively exploit the affordances of the blog to share knowledge and inform, e.g. through detailed explanations of terms, examples from everyday life and relevant contextual information via links, but also to educate and entertain, e.g. through the use of humour and irony, or narratives of professional and personal experience. The analysis also reveals that popularisation intertwines with self-expression in the medical weblog. The bloggers engage in self-disclosure and evaluative expression, use conversational, colloquial language, but at the same time they show that they are close to patients’ everyday experience. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Audience empowerment; Healthcare practitioners; Identity construction; Medical weblog; Popularisation",,,,,,,,,"Blanchard, A., Science blogs in research and popularization of science: Why, how, and for whom?

This article describes how public access to television affected the dialogues of Finnish tweeters on Twitter during the massive media event of the FIFA World Cup. Through the lens of digital conversation analysis, the study shows how the media publicity of tweets changed the direction of the interaction between tweeters and transformed their roles vis-à-vis the television show, making one of them into a ‘media flasher’ and the others viewers of his or her performance. The publicity was constructed as important through noticings, congratulations, and compliments, and in their responses to these actions the participants oriented to dilemmatic expectations of agreeing with the previous speaker and displaying modesty and authenticity. The activities of live tweeters can be seen as middle-space performances where ordinariness and celebrity are intertwined. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Broadcast talk; Digital conversation analysis; FIFA World Cup; Live tweeting; Media event; Social television; Twitter",,,,,,"Suomen Kulttuurirahasto, SKR: 00170958","This work was supported by the Finnish Cultural Foundation [Grant No. 00170958 ].",,"Alonso, O., Schiells, K., (2013), pp. 1037-1044. , Timelines as summaries of popular scheduled events.

In this article, I focus on an aspect of this relationship foregrounded by Boltanski: the degree to which viewers are encouraged to consider it possible to take action to prevent the suffering they are presented with. I draw on the concept of myth (Barthes, 2009) in order to study the degree to which fundraising is imbued with additional meanings, while other potential actions are obscured. Importantly, I apply these theories to an under-researched genre of charity communication: the intra-national telethon (in this case, the 2011 edition of the BBC's ‘Children in Need’). I complement analysis of this programme with that of a series of focus groups carried out in the fortnight following this broadcast with groups of people who have different professional and voluntary relationships with UK-based charities. I apply Rhetorical Discourse Analysis (Arribas-Ayllon et al., 2013) to the data because of its unique focus on accounts as a pervasive social activity; in both mediated and spoken charity discourse, the request for money and the response (or lack thereof) to such requests requires the constant production of justifications. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Charity telethon; Children in Need; Focus groups; Myth; Rhetorical Discourse Analysis",,,,,,"ES/I010904/1","This work was supported by the Economics and Social Research Council [grant number ES/I010904/1].",,"Arribas-Ayllon, M., Sarangi, S., Clarke, A., Genetic Testing: Accounts of Autonomy, Responsibility and Blame 2013 Routledge New York and Oxon; Barthes, R., (2009 [1972]) Mythologies Vintage London; Berg, O., To give or not to give: ethics after the tsunami (2005) NIASnytt, 2, pp. 16-17; Bilandzic, H., The perception of distance in the cultivation process: a theoretical consideration of the relationship between television content, processing experience and perceived distance (2006) Communicat.

The results also provided evidence supporting many previous findings regarding Clinton's and Trump's discourse/rhetoric styles and major campaign themes produced by studies using different research methods.

It analyzes how the discursive strategies through which participants introduce themselves as supporters relate to the support they provide. The analysis shows that the strategies employed to construct supporter identities commonly draw on what has been described as ‘somatic individuality’ – by which the management of biological ‘risks’ are framed as individual responsibilities – and by negotiating tensions between different perspectives on suicide. These are; (a) a discourse focusing on psychiatric knowledge and psychopharmaceuticals (b) a discourse focusing on social context and personal relationships, and (c) a critical stance towards the established care system. Negotiations between these condition, and are also conditioned by, power relations in the forum. These dynamics regulate the ways in which participants can use an online forum in order to move away from crisis points by discursively attempting to enter a supporter position. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Discursive psychology; Online support; Peer support; Social support; Suicide",,,,,,"VetenskapsrÃ¥det, VR

The findings suggest that: (1) translation shifts do exist in the translation of graduation epithets, particularly in the form of zero translation, though the cardinal principle of remaining faithful to the original Chinese political discourse is respected; (2) statistical analysis indicates a significant difference in the variation of attitudes towards China and other countries through translation shifts, and the variations of attitudes are in such a way that attitude towards China becomes less positive while attitude towards other countries less negative in the translation of political discourse from Chinese into English. It is argued that the translation participants’ adherence to the General Strategy of Politeness (Leech, 2014) can partially account for the research findings. It should also be noted that the basis for their adherence, ideologically speaking, is to serve the Self's interests. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Appraisal system; Chinese political discourse; Corpus-based discourse analysis; English translation; Politeness",,,,,,"2017BYY009

Attention is paid to performances of ‘vigilante’ identity – reactions in comment sections to perceived or possible transgressions against normative orders of the community. It is assumed that normative negotiations largely depend on characteristics of internet memes that are also shaped by their trajectories of usage in various environments, and hence also by their history. Identity work is thus approached as a chronotopically organized phenomenon; memes appear in certain chronotopic (timespace) configurations which ratify certain communicative practices and the way people orient to them in discussion. Seeing much of the identity work as chronotopically organized and dialogically negotiated opens up the path to a greater degree of complexity in analysis and brings new insights for the study of identity in social media. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Chronotope; Community; Identity; Internet memes; Normativity; Polandball",,,,,,"Ostravská Univerzita v Ostravě, OU","This paper is an output of the internal grant project SGS10/FF2017 Communicating Across Cultures: Local and Translocal Features of Genres in Online and Offline Environment at the University of Ostrava, Czech Republic.

It is motivated by the debate in Saudi Arabia on the impact of digital media on the way people use language, especially Arabic, how they manage their social relationships, and how they enact their cultural identities. The study was conducted at a women's university in Saudi Arabia. This paper presents a descriptive analysis of participants’ WhatsApp interactions, followed by an in-depth analysis of some examples, and highlights two important aspects: (1), an understudied linguistic variety used in Arabic digitally mediated communication, and (2), this paper proposes a more concrete approach to the analysis of “translanguaging,” which involves the utilization of tools from mediated discourse analysis (Jones and Norris, 2005). © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Digitally mediated communication; Mediated discourse analysis; Translanguaging",,,,,,,,,"Abu Elhija, D.A., A new writing system?

This natural disaster produced a large amount of online narratives by and about the survivors and their family members and acquaintances. Through an analysis of the interactional dynamics between these storytellers and their commenters in blogs, this article explores how these traumatic stories can be reshaped and manipulated for different ends and how a politicized collective identity among bloggers and commenters can be (co)constructed, contested, and solidified through blogging. More specifically, this article shows how these digital counter-narratives attempt to transform an allegedly sympathy-based virtual community into a community enraged by the purported causes of all the widespread suffering and distress. In this way, these virtual communities’ emotional stances are redirected more to environmental politics than to sympathy and grief in interesting ways. Besides investigating the pragmatics of narrative interaction in virtual environments, this article extends linguistic anthropological analytical and methodological tools to digital discursive practices. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Blog; Collective identity; Counter-narratives; Digital narrative; Earthquake; Emilia-Romagna (Italy); Stance",,,,,,"U.S. Air Force, USAF

Indeed, along with seeking and providing advice from and to others, expressions of social support, including empathic features, have been found to be central to discourse in online support groups (OSGs). This is the first study to use a pragmatics-based discourse analytic approach that focuses on “empathic communicative acts” (Pounds and De Pablos-Ortega, 2016) to investigate the expression of empathy on a social networking site (SNS), and specifically in a Facebook support group or FSG. The analysis is applied to 560 messages to a type 2 diabetes FSG and explores how empathy is expressed within the multi-dialogic context of asynchronous interaction. The study helps qualify the supportive value of FSGs and provides the basis for further studies of empathic communication in other SNS contexts. © 2018","Advice; Diabetes; Discourse; Empathic communicative acts; Empathy; Facebook-based support group",,,,,,"Economic and Social Research Council, ESRC: ES/K005103/1","We would like to thank the reviewers for their insightful comments on the earlier version of this article and gratefully acknowledge support from the Economic and Social Research Council, grant reference ES/K005103/1.",,"De la Torre-Díez, I., Díaz-Pernas, F.J., Antón-Rodríguez, M., A content analysis of chronic diseases social groups on Facebook and Twitter (2012) Telemedicine e-Health, 18 (6), pp. 404-408; Fage-Butler, A.M., Jensen, M.N., The interpersonal dimension of online patient forums: how patients manage informational and relational aspects in response to posted questions (2013) HERMES-J.

Health organisations can use social media to communicate about public health issues like the prevention of dementia for the purpose of improving population health outcomes. In this study, we examine posts on a conversation on a Facebook Page about dementia risk and prevention activity moderated by researchers affiliated with a prominent Australian dementia organisation. The analysis illustrates how posts in the conversation routinely functioned to make relevant and manage accountability and identity, and position users as responsible for risk-management. Understanding more about social norms of communicating about dementia risk-prevention online can provide insight into how posters experience and understand the issues of cognitive ageing and dementia, which may inform future tailored health communication strategies using social media. This is of significance given the increasing prevalence of dementia worldwide, and the growing importance of social media as sources of health information. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Advice; Dementia; Discourse analysis; Facebook; Health; Risk; Social media; Social networking sites",,,,,,,,,"Abramson, K., Keefe, B., Chou, W.S., Communicating about cancer through Facebook: a qualitative analysis of a breast cancer awareness page (2015) J.

Yet, we still know little about the practices and processes that generate such effects. This paper seeks to contribute to this understanding by examining polylogue online stories about postnatal depression (PND) on the popular parenting website Mumsnet. Drawing on the notion of narrative, small stories and positioning, this study shows how a narrative discourse-analytical approach can reveal narrative practices used to project and transform illness identities. At the micro level, the analysis shows that the small stories studied here draw on two big canonical narratives confession and exemplum. Whereas confessions are a ‘way in’ to disclose PND, the ‘didactical’ exempla serve as a knowledge resource and tools of alignment, and validation helping women to narratively repair ‘spoiled’ identity. At the macro-level, the analysis highlights tensions that exist between hegemonic discourses about motherhood and personal PND stories in which women appropriate and re-work these discourses to break silence and exercise agency. This study shows how together with technosocial factors these narrative practices can work to produce transformative effects of trouble telling and sharing online and contributes to a better understanding of digital practices underlying peer-to-peer interactions about stigmatised conditions. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Agency; Confession; Exemplum; Online health communication; Positioning; Postnatal depression",,,,,,,,,"Anesa, P., Fage-Butler, A., Popularizing biomedical information on an online health forum (2015) Ibérica, 29, pp. 105-128; Bamberg, M., Introductory remarks (2007) Narrative: State of the Art, pp. 1-5. , M.

Yet, there is little research on obesity blogs with existing studies focusing on specific obesity-related issues or examining blogging as a weight loss tool. Even less is known about how the overall obesity experience is conceptualised by blogging individuals and medical experts (particularly via metaphor - a device that aids discussions of sensitive issues) or the addressivity and self-presentation strategies employed on an interactive platform which affords tailored identity construction. This study analysed 343 posts from six (personal and professional) obesity blogs using critical metaphor analysis and addressivity analysis. The preferred source domain of metaphors in both blog types was Journey - with potentially positive implications for doctor-patient communication. Across blogs, Journey metaphors were recruited to highlight similar aspects of obesity in ways that challenged the mainstream before-after weight loss narrative. In personal blogs, Journey metaphors were employed to present the authors as travellers; in professional blogs, as guides. Metaphors thus contributed to self-presentations consistent with traditional views of the doctor-patient relationship. Finally, while individuals used various addressivity strategies, medical experts preferred those that project professionalism. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Addressivity; Blogging; Interactivity; Metaphor; Obesity; Self-presentation",,,,,,,,,"Archibald, D., Douglas, F., Hoddinott, P., van Teijlingen, E., Stewart, F., Robertson, C., Boyers, D., Avenell, A., A qualitative evidence synthesis on the management of male obesity (2015) BMJ Open; Ata, R.N., Thompson, K.J., Weight bias in the media: a review of recent research (2010) Obes.

It brings together research in two related areas of scholarship: academic discourse analysis and literacies research. In this introductory article, we first outline the concept of digital academic discourse as we perceive it in the context of our Special Issue and show how it is related to, and at the same time different from, its “analogue” predecessor. We then continue to discuss the practices surrounding the production of academic texts with the support of digital media, followed by an outline of how both digital academic discourse and related writing practices are tied to the networks, communities and spaces in which they take place. Next, methodological issues in the study of digital academic discourse are considered, and the articles in this special issue are presented in connection to the themes outlined above. We conclude by contextualising the studies reported here within current trends in discourse analytical and sociolinguistic research and identify venues for future studies. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",,,,,,,"Stockholms Universitet, SU

It is the aim of this paper to explore this new academic digital genre by analysing the communicative purpose and the rhetorical macrostructure of a corpus of VSI Introductions in the field of Business Management and Marketing. Interpersonality features will be explored to unveil how they help VSI Introduction authors to portray themselves as knowledgeable members of the discipline to a potentially heterogeneous audience as well as to create a positive image of the journal, making it a prominent site of publication in the field.

Surveys and historical research have established that – both in democratic states and in those of the Soviet Bloc (while it existed) – antisemitism has long been related to or expressed in the form of statements about Israel or ‘Zionist’ permitting anti-Jewish attitudes to circulate under cover of political critique. This article looks at how the findings of a survey of anti-Jewish and anti-Israeli attitudes were rejected by users of three Facebook pages associated with the British Left. Through thematic discourse analysis, three recurrent repertoires are identified: firstly, what David Hirsh calls the ‘Livingstone Formulation’ (i.e. the argument that complaints of antisemitism are made in bad faith to protect Israel and/or attack the Left), secondly, accusations of flawed methodology similar to those with which UK Labour Party supporters routinely dismiss the findings of unfavourable opinion polls, and thirdly, the argument that, because certain classically antisemitic beliefs pertain to a supposed Jewish or ‘Zionist’ elite and not to Jews in general, they are not antisemitic. In one case, the latter repertoire facilitates virtually unopposed apologism for Adolf Hitler. Contextual evidence suggests that the dominance of such repertoires within one very large UK Labour Party-aligned group may be the result of action on the part of certain ‘admins’ or moderators.

Held within the sociopolitical context of reform and opening-up, the televised and interpreter-mediated premier's press conferences constitute such a discursive event that facilitates the articulation of China's discourse to domestic and international audiences. This corpus-based CDA study explores how China's discourse on its past actions and accomplishments is mediated by government interpreters cross-linguistically in China's global voice — English. Through investigating the concordance lines containing the top 3 self-referential items (we/China/government), the use of present perfect (continuous) structures is established as a prominent feature in (re)presenting Beijing's achievements in English. Critical comparisons with the Chinese originals suggest the interpreters’ proliferated use of these structures, which discursively leads to a stronger level of accomplishment, positive self-portrayal and, resultantly, political legitimisation. This interdisciplinary study highlights the interpreters’ often neglected yet vital agency in further legitimating and (re)constructing China's image as important (re)tellers of “China's story” beyond national borders. This is particularly the case, given the mediat(is)ed and (re)mediat(is)ed nature of the high-profile event. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","corpus-based CDA; Discursive (re)presentation; Interpreted political discourse; Interpreters’ agency; Mediat(is)ed political discourse; Premier-Meets-the-Press conferences; Televised political press conferences",,,,,,,,,"Baker, P., Gabrielatos, C., KhosraviNik, M., Krzyzanowski, M., McEnery, T., Wodak, R., A useful methodological synergy?

Core genres such as the journal article and monograph remain central, but the ways they are now commonly produced via file-sharing software and online submission systems are changing them. Digital media also allows academics to stay up to date with their field, connect with others, and share research with wider audiences. Furthermore, academics are increasingly expected to maintain online identities via academic networking sites, and to create and disseminate knowledge via hybrid genres such as tweets and blogs. However, these platforms also represent a potential threat to academics’ values and sense of identity. This paper reports on an ESRC funded research project investigating the writing practices of academics across different disciplines at three English universities. Through academics’ accounts of their experience with and feelings about the role of digital media in their professional writing, this paper explores the factors that complicate their engagement with new genres of writing. The findings reveal a tension between the values of social media, which see knowledge as user-generated and decentralised, and the forms of knowledge creation that are rewarded in academia. © 2018 The Authors",,,,,,,"Economic and Social Research Council: ES/L01159X/1","We are pleased to acknowledge the support of the other members of the research team, Ibrar Bhatt, Mary Hamilton and Karin Tusting.

The analysis focuses on the interplay between language, discourse and journalistic practices, rooted in a specific journalistic and civic culture that aims at constructing a shared public sphere in opposition to mainstream media reports about the Mediterranean. The results demonstrate a particular polycentrism and mobility of media production, observable in language, discourse and journalistic features, in which localities traditionally considered “at the periphery” of global media flows, such as the Western Mediterranean islands Sicily, Sardinia and Corsica, constitute crucial points. The article approaches the resulting multilayered transculturality by grasping the specific culture inspiring the work of the network, and the multiple identities related to it. To this aim, a transdisciplinary approach integrating sociolinguistics, discourse, media and cultural studies with a specific focus on mediatized transcultural communication is developed. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Cultural diversity; Language; Media; Mediterranean; Multilingualism; Transcultural communication",,,,,,"Universität Heidelberg","This work was supported by the Heidelberg Centre for Transcultural Studies, Cluster of Excellence “Asia and Europe in a Global Context” at the University of Heidelberg.

It demonstrates how the more than sixty thousand strong social media ‘Army’ formed around a terminally ill baby at the centre of a parent-judiciary-hospital legal battle, used key tropes and devices of populist rhetoric to establish lay-expertise in its performance of support for the ordinary patient and their family, de-recognizing and vilifying medical expertise and publicly funded healthcare systems built on socio-democratic ideals. The article shows how users’ mobilization of populist rhetoric to reject professional expertise and public institutions, made use of established architectural features of the online community's socio-technological design, such as immediacy, remediation and protective gatekeeping. The paper argues that this fed into and out of an environment of disdain for public services and expertise in contemporary UK. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Campaign; Charlie Gard; Facebook; Patient; populism; Social media; Twitter",,,,,,"University of Surrey

Drawing upon analytical tools evolved from Conversation Analysis and Multimodal Discourse Analysis, this study examined a pool of Weibo tweets and responses employed in discussing an Internet anti-corruption event, i.e., the “Brother Watch” event which happened in 2012. The analysis showed that Weibo interaction featured an overarching sequence of “key tweet + responses”, wherein key tweets were formulated as newsworthy and authentic messages to engage the audience. Responses were designed to project new meanings and actions while orienting to prior turns. As a result, exposed information became repetitively circulated, amplified and reinforced, and eventually shaped into an online public event. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Internet anti-corruption; Key tweet; Responses; Turn design; Weibo interaction",,,,,,"JXYJG2016-066

Through an examination of the politically incorrect board (/pol/), this paper begins to reanalyze scale, alignment, and double-voicing approaches in ways that necessitate novel understandings of digitally placed discourse. This website has demonstrated unique engagements with these categories, engaging with global and personal discourses through anonymity, geographically “situated” flag markers, and green-text narrative techniques, among others. This essay contains a number of examples found through 4chan's /pol/ via qualitative-oriented, inscriptive gathering techniques of discourses concerning both the continuing European and American migration issues, as they are explored by a globally situated, digital community. Through banal, everyday engagements with both the material and the website features themselves, users craft new realizations of identity and interaction in a space that seeks to make all anonymous. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","4chan; Ambiguity; Digital; Discourse; Scales",,,,,,,,,"Agha, A., Voicing, Footing, Enregisterment (2005) J.

The research paper is still a prominent genre in the field, but technological advances such as the development of real-time collaborative writing tools and social media have created new opportunities for collaboration as well as the sharing of research results. This paper takes a closer look at how digital tools, particularly collaborative writing tools and Twitter, are utilised in the process of producing a research paper for publication, and how the authors and their colleagues view the role of such tools in the text production process. The data include a text history of a research paper, as well as research interviews with the main authors and their colleagues. The data have been approached from a local practices perspective, considering the paper as part of the writing practices of the multicultural research group where the authors worked. The interviews provide further perspectives on the researchers’ use of digital tools. The findings shed light on collaborative research writing practices, particularly how collaborative writing tools, which enable new practices such as synchronous writing, may not be utilised by the researchers in the ways intended by the developers. The findings also highlight the significance of social media tools, particularly Twitter, in post-publication activities, with important implications for researcher education. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Collaborative writing; Digital media; Text history; Text trajectory; Twitter; Writing practices",,,,,,"Koneen SÃ¤Ã¤tiÃ¶: 088787","This work was conducted in the LaRA project, which is financially supported by the Kone Foundation [grant number 088787 ].

For our research purposes, we conducted a qualitative textual analysis of pertinent concordances from the corpus which revealed co-occurrence of “old” and “past” with collocates related to religion and society, consciousness, as well as the old and the past of humanity. In the concordance evidence, both lexical items, in the company with their lexical collocates, receive negative connotations, especially with reference to cultural institutions, as well as the old and the past, thus assuming a negative discourse prosody. Further, in the specialized corpus, “old” and “past” as well as their related concepts contrast with the positively connoted lexical items “new” and “present” and their related concepts. Overall, our findings reveal the linguistic manifestation of the ideology of the New Age movement in the concordance evidence on “old” and “past” specifically criticism of the old cultural institutions of the past for their negative impact on humanity, advocating liberation from their effects and promotion of life in the present. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Collocate; Concordance; Discourse prosody; New Age movement; Old; Past",,,,,,,,,"(2007), http://www.antlab.sci.waseda.ac.jp/software/README_antconc3.2.1txt, Antony, Laurence.

Given the role of right-wing media in legitimising and encouraging traditionalist, nationalist or sometimes far-right populist discourse, the linguistic and semantic relationship between news and readers’ discourse in the context of right-leaning news websites merits investigation in the current climate. This paper examines the relationship in terms of representations of Islam and Catholicism in Daily Mail and Telegraph websites. Empirical keyword analysis of news articles and linked comments is presented. Key semantic categories revealed evidence for stereotypical representation of these religions, as applicable to new media contexts and enacted in the websites of traditional print media. Results highlighted that long-term themes such as ‘Islamic terrorism, war and extreme belief’ and ‘the Pope, Vatican and scandals in the Catholic Church’ continue to dominate news stories online. 18 out of 19 categories in Islam news repeated in comments, and 9 out of 13 in Catholicism news repeated in comments. This strong overlap indicated close connections between news and comments and shared ideologies. Higher numbers of semantic categories in comments showed greater variation of topics than news, with 15 and 23 additional categories in Islam and Catholicism comments respectively. However, key multi-words reflecting collectivisation of communities, such as Muslim country, were identified in news and repeated in comments. Investigation of Muslim country revealed nationalistic and polarising statements by readers, while investigation of penitents revealed portrayal of Catholics as an ‘out-group’ through lexis which denoted violence, shock and crime. Closer analysis of some keywords revealed polarity between readers displaying differing views in relation to various aspects of religion. Taken together, however, findings suggested that age old stereotypes of minority religions were perpetuated in new media contexts. © 2017","Catholicism; Ideology; Islam; News; Online discourse; Reader comments; Religion",,,,,,"Newman University","This work was part of a PhD study supported by Newman University, Birmingham, UK .",,"Abercrombie, N., Turner, B.S., (1978), pp. 149-70. , ‘The Dominant Ideology Thesis’.

The residents of Hawaiʻi and speakers of this language often view it with a complex mixture of both hate and love. Previous discursive approaches to this topic have often focused on the strategic, pragmatic uses of the language for constructing identities and ideologies however the complex and often contradictory nature of Pidgin speakers’ beliefs and attitudes towards their language is often missing from these analyses. In this article, the ideologies of Pidgin are examined through analyzing the comedic skits of Rap Reiplinger, a local comedian whose work still enjoys great popularity over 30 years after his death. By mapping out the indexical fields this article shows how multiple and sometimes opposing ideologies may be simultaneously produced and reproduced in Pidgin comedy routines by the formation of multiple semiotic centers. The analysis will also show how these ideologies are then re-appropriated by others through selective activation of these indexical fields and how the activation of multiple fields can lead to the reproduction of those contradicting beliefs that are at the core of Pidgin speakers attitudes towards their own language. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Comedy; Hawaiʻi Creole; Indexicality; Linguistic schizophrenia; Pidgin",,,,,,,,,"(2014), https://www.reddit.com/r/Hawaii/comments/2p7yzu/mainlander_here_with_questions_about_pidgin_wanna/, Bioneural, December 14.

The focus of analysis is the use of metaparody, or the parodying of a parody, and how this device problematizes White Hollywood representations of blackness while simultaneously reinforcing them. These metaparodic blackface performances also involve “linguistic minstrelsy,” a form of mock language that has existed since nineteenth-century minstrel shows, to construct Black identities for White characters. Linguistic minstrelsy in these films produces a jocularly oversimplified version of African American English. However, in these films, the linguistic and blackface minstrelsy are interpreted as humorous projections of incompetent white performances of blackness instead of merely parodies of African American language and culture for the following two reasons. First, the films include an “authentic” Black character who evaluates the performances for the audience. Second, the films limit the speaker roles for the blackface characters. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","African American English; Film; Linguistic minstrelsy; Metaparody; Racism; Representation",,,,,,,,,"Bailey, G., The relationship between African American vernacular English and White vernaculars in the American South: a sociocultural history and some phonological evidence (2001) Sociocultural and Historical Contexts of African American English, pp. 53-92. , Sonja Lanehart John Benjamins Amsterdam; Bakhtin, M.M., (1986), Speech Genres and Other Late Essays (V.W.

Drawing on studies of music videos, TV ads, and film in cultural and media studies and multimodal studies, this paper examines an under-researched area of hip hop, the global spread of Chicano rap, by conducting a multilingual, multimodal critical discourse analysis of several videos by Mona AKA Sad Girl, a Japanese rapper whose lyrics switch between Japanese, Spanish, and English. This genre-based study looks at how the artist constructs a feminist glocal identity through a combination of song lyrics, musical style, cultural iconography, body decoration, gesture and film techniques that localize the oppositional super-vernacular of Chicano rap while challenging discourses of patriarchy and nationalism. The study also takes into account data from an interview with the artist and social media to gain insights into issues of authenticity and cultural appropriation. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Globalization of hip hop; Japanese Chicano rap; Mona AKA Sad Girl; Multilingualism; Multimodal critical discourse analysis; Super-vernacular",,,,,,"University of Arizona, UA","I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to Crescencio López González for his encouragement, helpful discussions, useful insights, and feedback in preparing this paper.

While in-depth treatments of language in Golding's The Inheritors have since been offered (Halliday, 1971; Hoover, 1999; Clark, 2009), the “possibilities of the dialogue,” in particular the conversational register of the Neanderthal characters, remain largely neglected. In this sociopragmatic re-reading of The Inheritors, I employ theory of mind and intentionality (as outlined in Dunbar (2004) as analytical tools in order to ‘listen’ more closely to the Neanderthals in Golding's text. Paying particular attention to these characters as they express their religious beliefs, engage in storytelling, and work through interpersonal conflicts, I argue that readers are invited to infer that the Neanderthal characters are themselves inferring beings, and further demonstrate that this interpretation has implications not only for how individuals approach the novel, but for the way The Inheritors as a cultural text can be understood to participate in discursively mediating our relationship with the figure of the Neanderthal. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Intentionality; Neanderthal; Pragmatic stylistics; Sociopragmatic; The Inheritors; Theory of mind",,,,,,,,,"Adriaens, M., Style in William Golding's The Inheritors (1970) English Stud., 5, pp. 16-30; Austin, J.L., How to Do Things with Words (1962), Oxford University Press Oxford; Bakhtin, M., The Dialogic Imagination: Four Essays, Translated by Caryl Emerson and Michael Holquist, Edited by Michael Holquist (1981), University of Texas Press Austin; Black, E., Pragmatic Stylistics (2006), Edinburgh University Press Edinburgh; Black, E., Metaphor, simile and cognition in Golding's The Inheritors (1993) Lang.

Box 2713, Doha, Qatar","Aiming at suggesting ways whereby the sociolinguistic paradigm can benefit from the analysis of chick lit, this paper explores the ways through which the social class of “elegant poverty” is stylistically constructed in Modern Greek chick lit texts. Although chick lit has been analyzed primarily in terms of gender identity construction, I argue that it can be also seen as a goldmine of styles pertinent to social class due to its rather extravagant but meticulous treatment of social class cultural models and the caustic stylistic representation thereof, both of which aim at increasing the sales of chick lit. More specifically, chick lit offers analytical insights into social classes that are powerful but are traditionally hard to get ethnographic access to, such as elegant poverty in Athens. Relatively recently formed, elegant poverty consists of primarily former wealthy northern Athenian suburbanites who due to the financial recession are characterized by the ownership of estate but absolute lack of cash. Drawing on excerpts from chick lit authored by Pavlina Nasioutzik, it is argued that in chick lit elegant poverty is represented as the amalgam of socioeconomic and cultural models, which are styled through irony, satire and code-switching. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Athens; Chick lit; Cultural model; Elegant poverty; Lifestyle; Social class; Sociolinguistics; Style",,,,,,,,,"Agha, A., Voicing, footing, enregisterment (2005) J.

In particular, I attempt to combine a CDA with a LI view, using, as example, the sociolinguistic study of fiction, since it has largely failed to account for the ideological role of fictional discourse to contribute to the shaping of sociolinguistic diversity. Besides, both CDA and LI have much to gain by engaging with each other. On the one hand, CDA might extend its scope of interest, by viewing language not only as a vehicle through which social inequalities are perpetuated, but also as a topic of social inequalities in itself. On the other hand, LI could be enhanced by the methods of closer textual analysis which is characteristic of CDA. Specifically, I draw on the sociocultural CDA approach of Fairclough. Moreover, I exploit both a macro-level approach of language ideologies as widely shared beliefs about language and a micro-level conceptualization of language ideologies as schemata held by speakers to construe the social meaning of particular instances of language use. To illustrate the proposed synthesis, I use one example from representations of youth language in a Greek family sitcom. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Greek television; Hegemonic meanings; Metapragmatic discourse; Sociolinguistic diversity; Youth",,,,,,,,,"Agha, A., The social life of a cultural value (2003) Lang.

This study investigates the formation and (re)negotiation of widespread social stereotypes and language ideologies concerning immigrants and their use of Greek in fictional data. We investigate an online antiracist campaign that officially aims to dissolve the disclaimer “I'm not racist but…”. We specifically analyze three antiracist clips uploaded on YouTube representing encounters between majority members and immigrants. We focus on humor through which antiracist messages are aimed to be communicated to the public. Our findings confirm that although humor is exploited so as to expose and stigmatize racist practices, the data under scrutiny end up reproducing the ideology of ethnic monolingualism. Through an analysis of the linguistic and stylistic resources assigned to the represented characters, we reveal the deeply entrenched indexical order of the Greek language monopoly which goes hand in hand with racist attitudes. To this end, the disclaimer “we stigmatize racism, but we expect immigrants to assimilate to our language and culture” arises, thus, broadening the spectrum of racist discourses. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Greek monolingualism; Humor; Immigrants; Language ideology; Racist discourse",,,,,,,,,"Agha, A., The social life of cultural value (2003) Lang.

Through iconic characteristics of confidence and wit, Bond's image as a debonair Englishman has been carefully orchestrated and upheld. For this, much credit is due to the many secondary characters who exist primarily to index him as the ideal man, often at their expense. To achieve this, the films frequently employ methods of othering, particularly through exaggerating racial identities to the point of exoticization. While accusations that the Bond film series is riddled with racial stereotypes are not new, there exist gaps in scholarship addressing East Asian presence and stereotypes. This paper investigates (mis)representations of East Asian characters, examining them separately as allies and villains, through analyzing processes which mediatize their languages and cultures. Ultimately, it confronts the mediatization processes of East Asia within the Bond film series and explores the social meanings enregistered therein. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","East Asia; Film; James Bond; Mediatization; Race; Sociolinguistics",,,,,,"FY2014-FRC3-003","We deeply thank Anastasia Stamou and our two anonymous reviewers for their valuable comments on the earlier version of this paper.

In Scott (2015), I argued that these different functions are, at least partly, driven by the properties associated with mediated discourse. However, hashtags are also sometimes produced in spoken discourse, where the interlocutors share a physical context and are likely to have access to a range of contextual assumptions and non-verbal cues that are unavailable online. In face-to-face communication the audience is less likely to be “imagined” in the sense of boyd (2010) and the speaker is less likely to have to negotiate “context collapse”, as identified by Marwick and boyd (2011). Drawing on principles from the relevance-theoretic pragmatic framework (Sperber and Wilson, 1986/95), I argue that in such an enriched context, the range of pragmatic functions of hashtags is likely to be reduced, and will be motivated by factors other than an impoverished discourse context. I draw on data from attested spoken examples and show that spoken hashtags seem to be largely restricted to their interpersonal “metacomment” (Zappavigna, 2015, p. 6) function, and that they are most commonly used to provide evaluative judgements on the rest of the utterance and to guide inferences concerning the speaker's attitudinal stance. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Computer-mediated communication; Hashtag; Pragmatics; Relevance theory; Tagging",,,,,,,,,"Baron, N.S., Alphabet to Email: How Written English Evolved and Where It's Heading (2000), Routledge London; Baym, N.K., Personal Connections in the Digital Age (2010), Polity Press Cambridge; Biddle, S., How the Hashtag Is Ruining the English Language (Updated) (2011), http://gizmodo.com/5869538/how-the-hashtag-is-ruining-the-english-language, ([Online] Available at: Accessed 24 3 2016); Blakemore, D., Semantic Constraints on Relevance (1987), Blackwell Oxford; Blakemore, D., Relevance and Linguistic Meaning: The Semantics and Pragmatics of Discourse Markers (2002), Cambridge University Press Cambridge; boyd, D., Social network sites as networked public: affordances, dynamics and implications (2010) Networked Self: Identity, Community and Culture on Social Network Sites, pp. 39-58. , Z.

However, this resource has been creatively exploited by some users beyond its folksonomic use: Since Tumblr does not have a separate comment section for posts, the tag section may also be used for tags with discourse functions such as expressing an opinion, a reaction, or including asides. This article explores the practice of including comments in tags, taking into account the specific technological features of Tumblr's tagging system, as well as the role of the communities within the website. The corpus analyzed in the study comprises two datasets collected from the general ‘Trending’ page of Tumblr and 60 fan communities (‘fandoms’). Comment tags and their identified discourse functions (opinion, reaction, aside) are analyzed quantitatively for differences regarding use, structure, and sentiment. The analysis shows significant differences between the comment tags and traditional keyword tags, as well as among comment tags with the three different discourse functions. The results suggest that social tagging practices on Tumblr are influenced both by the technological specifications of the platform and the social structure of the website. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Computer-mediated communication; Discourse analysis; Fandoms; Social tagging; Tumblr",,,,,,,,,"Barton, D., Tagging on Flickr as a social practice (2015) Discourse and Digital Practices: Doing Discourse Analysis in the Digital Age, pp. 48-65. , R.

This article seeks to fill this gap by providing a narrative-discourse perspective on how hashtags are used as resources for sharing and story making (Androutsopoulos, 2014; Georgakopoulou, 2015a, 2015b, in press), foregrounding narrative as a circulatory drive on social media. The data for analysis are drawn from Twitter and the Guardian's rolling coverage of the deadly attacks at the satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo offices on January 7th, 2015. The analysis looks at the emergence and circulation of hashtags #CharlieHebdo and #JeSuisCharlie in their polylingual instantiations. Its findings point to the hashtags’ metalinguistic, metadiscursive and metanarrative functions in relation to positions of narrative stancetaking made available to networked publics. It is argued that hashtag sharing in this case attests to a shift from modes of ecstatic global news reporting and spectatorships of suffering (Chouliaraki, 2006) to modes of ecstatic sharing on social media which create dividing lines of evaluative assessments of the events. The study contributes to the empirical study of hashtagging as social and discourse practice. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Ecstatic sharing; Hashtags; JeSuisCharlie; Narrative stancetaking; Polylanguaging",,,,,,,,,"Androutsopoulos, J., English ‘on top’: Discourse functions of English resources in the German mediascape (2013) Sociolinguist.

This article explores how hashtags are used to coordinate and accentuate the values construed in a corpus of Twitter posts (tweets) about depression. In other words, it explores how people use hashtags as a resource to ‘convoke’ communities of feeling around values realised as ideation-attitude couplings. The aim is to extend work on dialogic affiliation (Knight, 2010a, 2010b, 2013) in order to account for ‘ambient’ affiliation via social media, where participants do not necessarily interact directly. We employ a discursive system, communing affiliation, to interpret how particular values about depression are positioned as bondable in this ambient environment. The focus is on understanding how people are forging alignments and negotiating meaning through social tagging practices. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Affiliation; Depression; Hashtags; Social media; Social tagging; Systemic functional linguistics",,,,,,,,,"(1935), Bakhtin, M./1981.

From a pragmatic perspective, self-promotion and self-praise are interactionally risky acts. While some studies have shed light on self-praise in online communities, little attention has been paid to the pragmatic function of the affordances of digital media such as hashtagging and multimodality in self-praising discourse. This article contributes to filling this research gap by examining the ways in which posters of “bragging” Instagram photos do face work by using the hashtags #brag and #humblebrag in interaction with positive (im-)politeness strategies. It presents the results of both a small-scale quantitative study of face work in Instagram posts labelled #fitness, #brag and #humblebrag, as well as a qualitative analysis of the mitigation and aggravation strategies used in explicitly self-praising posts. The article argues that the hashtags #brag and #humblebrag have a clear metalinguistic function as a reference to the illocution of the speech act. It also shows that they are used in a balancing act of face mitigation and aggravation strategies. Overall, the study suggests that the hashtags #brag and #humblebrag function as part of a strategy that negotiates an appropriate level of self-praise and positive self-presentation. The study adds to an understanding of the pragmatics of self-presentation on social media, and raises questions regarding the new literacies that digital media require. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Face work; Hashtags; Impoliteness; Instagram; Positive self-presentation; Self-praise",,,,,,,,,"Alford, H., If I Do Humblebrag So Myself (2012) The New York Times, , http://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/02/fashion/bah-humblebrag-the-unfortunate-rise-of-false-humility.html, Retrieved from; Angouri, J., Tseliga, T., “You Have No Idea What You are Talking About!” From e-disagreement to e-impoliteness in two online fora (2010) J.

With the Chinese search word #雨傘運動 (“Umbrella Movement”), over 9000 hashtags were collected from 700 posts on Instagram. These hashtags were coded by language choice and their broad discourse functions of fact, opinion, and emotion. Our analysis suggests that while stating facts and expressing opinions, a significant proportion of Instagram hashtags about the Umbrella Movement are also affective in function (e.g. #ilovehongkong, #hate). These hashtags convey emotions associated mainly with political demands, solidarity, unity, hatred, frustration, and dissatisfaction. We also conducted online interviews with selected Instagram users to understand better their multilingual hashtagging practices and language attitudes. Overall, the present study suggests that affect was expressed and experienced through a common set of linguistic resources - Cantonese, mixed code, and traditional Chinese characters - which then became codes of unity and solidarity in difficult times. Interviewees also produced discourses of pride in Cantonese which further suggest the use of Cantonese in asserting their unique Hongkonger identities. Drawing on Ahmed's (2004) notion of ‘affective economies’ this article concludes by unravelling the relationship between language, emotion, digital technologies, and politics. © 2017","Affect; Emotion; Hashtags; Identities; Instagram; Multilingualism",,,,,,,,,"Ahmed, S., The Cultural Politics of Emotion (2004), Edinburgh University Press Edinburgh; Androutsopoulos, J., Negotiating authenticities in mediatized times (2015) Discour., Context Media, 8, pp. 74-77; Barton, D., Tagging on Flickr as a social practice (2015) Discourse and Digital Practices: Doing Discourse Analysis in the Digital Age, pp. 48-65. , R.

The site developers intended uses are primarily to build a taxonomy to make the images on the site easily searchable. Data from examples of Flickr tags and interviews with selected users reveal that some tagging fits with this aim, whilst other uses challenge and subvert the intended uses. Tagging is used to do at least the following: identifying existing information in a photo; adding relevant new information; expressing affective stance towards the images; addressing specific audiences; making unrelated ‘asides’; and for creative play. The discussion is then broadened by examining a dispute between Flickr and its users about changes being made to the site: this act as a ‘telling case’ (Mitchell, 1984) as people articulate what the site enables them to do and what it hinders. The dispute generated a thread of more than 29,000 comments, making a corpus of 1,774,401 words. Using corpus linguistics tools the paper demonstrates how users contribute to curating this site, including their uses of tagging. Steps involved in curating the site are identified, including a focus on verbs of curation. Overall, the paper contributes to the analysis of a set of ‘new’ literacy practices and to understanding digital curation. The methods of the two studies reported here productively combine detailed methods of qualitative research with the breadth of quantitative analysis. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Curation; Flickr; Online; Practices; Tagging; Taxonomy",,,,,,,,,"Baker, P., Sociolinguistics and Corpus Linguistics (2010), Edinburgh University Press; Barton, Tagging on Flickr as a social practice (2015) Discourse and Digital Practices: Doing Discourse Analysis In The Digital Age, pp. 48-65. , R.

This paper provides some new insights into this nexus between context and text via a report of a study into Iranian Farsi/Persian-language journalism – specifically into a particular type of political news reporting concerned with covering the speeches and announcements of high-status political figures. The paper provides evidence that these reports combine a distinctive generic structure with a distinctive writing style, “distinctive” at least in the sense that neither has hitherto been observed in the news reporting of other languages. With respect to generic structure, these reports do not operate with the so-called “inverted pyramid” structure, so often associated with English-language journalism, by which the opening headline/lead establishes a point or angle of maximal significance. With respect to their stylistic properties, these texts are highly constrained attitudinally, with even fewer instances of authorial assessment or interpretation than is typically the case in, for example, English-language “hard news” reporting. It is proposed that this apparently unique style-and-structure combination can plausibly be related to the unique cultural, political and religious conditions under which news journalism operates in Iran. It will be argued that this way of reporting political news reflects the subordination of news media organisations to the political establishment in that country. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Iranian journalism; Journalistic voice; News genre; Objectivity; Political reporting",,,,,,,,,"Iedema, R., Feez, S., White, P.R.R., Media Literacy (1994), NSW, Department of School Education Sydney, Disadvantaged schools programs; Khiabany, G., The Iranian state, press and civil society (2008) Media, Culture and Society in Iran: Living with Globalisation and Islamic State, pp. 17-36. , M.

We examine the discourses and representation of social class drawn upon in public reactions to the program. We compiled a corpus of live tweets that were sent during the first airing of each episode of Benefits Street II, which included the hashtags #BenefitsStreet and/or #BenefitStreet. Our corpus comprises 11,623 tweets sourced from over four thousand Twitter accounts. Drawing on techniques from corpus-based discourse analysis, and contrasting our findings to an earlier study on Benefits Street by Baker and McEnery (2015a), we offer an insight into viewers’ discursive constructions of benefit claimants not just as scroungers, but as a more generally morally inadequate and flawed underclass. We argue that poverty porn programmes such as Benefits Street encourage viewers to see any positive representations of benefits claimants as exceptions to the rule. © 2017","Audience response; Benefits Street; Corpus-based discourse analysis; Reality TV; Twitter",,,,,,,,,"Agha, A., The social life of cultural value (2003) Language Commun., 23, pp. 231-273; Anstead, N., (2010), https://static1.squarespace.com/static/566d81c8d82d5ed309b2e935/t/567ab24b1c12101fd291a3c7/1450881611076/Anstead_OLoughlin_BBCQT_Twitter_Final.pdf, O'Loughlin, B.

Specifically, the paper reports on the preliminary findings of a preliminary study which investigates various patterns in the reuse of images which appear in ISIS's official propaganda magazines Dabiq and Rumiyah by others across various public online media platforms (e.g. news websites, social media news aggregates, blogs). Using a mixed methods approach informed by multimodal discourse analysis, and combined with data mining and information visualisation, the study addresses questions such as which types of images produced and used by ISIS in its propaganda magazines recirculate most frequently in other online media over time, on which types of online media these images reappear, and in which contexts they are used and reused on these websites, that is that is, whether the tone of the message is corporate (formal) or personal (informal). Preliminary findings from the study suggest different recontextualisation patterns for certain types of ISIS-related images of over time. The study also found that the majority of violent extremist images used in the sample analysis appear to circulate most frequently on Western news and politics websites and news aggregate platforms, in predominantly formal contexts. © 2017","Data mining; Information visualisation; Multimodal discourse analysis; Multimodal mixed methods approach; Online media; Recontextualisation; Violent extremist images",,,,,,,,,"Archetti, C., Terrorism, communication and new media: explaining radicalization in the digital age (2015) Perspectives Terrorism, 9 (1); Bartlett, J., Reynolds, L., The State of the Art 2015: A Literature Review of Social Media Intelligence Capabilities for Counterterrorism (2015), Demos London; Bateman, J.A., Multimodality and genre: a foundation for the systematic analysis of multimodal documents (2008) Palgrave Macmillan; Bateman, J.A., Text and Image: A Critical Introduction to The Visual/Verbal Divide (2014), Routledge New York; Bateman, J.A., Using Multimodal Corpora for Empirical Research (2014) The Routledge Handbook of Mutimodal Analysis, pp. 238-252. , C.

The Hebrew Facebook translators' community maintained a decentralized approach, lacking the affordances for hierarchies of expertise, focusing on the practicality of the language and the speed of project completion. The comparative design within the same speech community stressed the role of affordances as nonhuman language agents in the social process of language policy. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Facebook translations discourse; Hebrew discourse online; Hebrew Wikipedia discourse; Nonhuman language agents; Online language policing",,,,,,,,,"http://hebrew-academy.huji.ac.il/English/AboutTheAcademy/Pages/default.aspx, AHL (Academy of the Hebrew Language). n.d. << (accessed 10 August 2014); Androutsopoulos, J., (2008), http://www.languageatinternet.org/articles/2008/1610/, Potentials and Limitations of Discourse-Centered Online Ethnography.

Drawing on data from the Spanish and UK versions of the programme, the present paper is placed at the intersection between routine and cross-cultural business practices on the one hand and reality based broadcast on the other.

While requests are deeply embedded in the suggested scaffold of the GoFundMe platform, authors depart in codified ways from the strategies recommended by the site. These vernacular departures serve to position people in dire need of assistance as respectable and worthy of help. We argue such self-positioning distracts from the injustices of a free-market medical system that depletes people's resources and renders them precarious subjects at the mercy of donations from individuals in the same socio-economic boat. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Crowdfunding; GoFundMe; Identity; Personal fundraising; Presentation of self; Social media",,,,,,,"The GFM scaffold gives primacy to the request for financial assistance, encouraging authors to highlight exactly what is needed, why and when. However, we found across the campaigns that authors chose instead to wait until the end of their narratives to make the actual request. Furthermore, in a face-saving move that ensures requester and audience member may stay in relationship without a monetary donation, the request is usually followed by a reassuring statement that even prayers and other forms of support are welcome. The posts often close with preliminary expressions of gratitude.",,"Aitamurto, T., The impact of crowdfunding on journalism: case study of Spot.Us, a platform for community-funded reporting (2011) Journalism Pract., 5 (4), pp. 429-445; Allen, M., Crowdfunding site rallies resources (2013) San Diego Business J., 34 (43), p. 1; Antonenko, P.D., Lee, B.R., Kleinheksel, A.J., Trends in the crowdfunding of educational technology startups (2014) TechTrends, 58 (6), pp. 36-41; Baeck, P., Collins, L., (2013), http://www.nesta.org.uk/publications/working-crowd, Working the crowd.

Unlike institutional communication or quality press coverage of climate change, commercial science journalism has received less attention with respect to how it frames the crisis. Assuming that the construction of newsworthiness in popular science journalism requires eliminating, or at least obscuring, some alienating information, the study identifies prevalent frames, news values and discursive strategies in the outlet's most-read online articles on climate change (2013–2015). With the official statement of the World Meteorological Organization (2014) as a reference, it considers which dimensions of the coverage have been backgrounded, and illustrates how language is recruited to de-emphasize some representations through implicitness, underspecification, or syntactic and compositional devices. It finds that the coverage relies on threat frames, privileges novelty and the timeliness and impact of climate science, avoids responsibility and adaptation frames, and endorses the so-called progress narrative. It discusses how this may forestall social and personal mobilization by placing trust in science institutions and technologies to confront the crisis. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Climate change; Critical discourse analysis; Frame; Mobilization; New Scientist; Popular science journalism",,,,,,,,,"Anshelm, J., Hultman, M., Discourses of Global Climate Change: Apocalyptic Framing and Political Antagonisms (2015), Routledge London; Beck, U., World at Risk (2009), Polity Press Cambridge; Bednarek, M., Caple, H., Why do news values matter?

While tourism can be attributed to the growing capitalist dream of exploration, it is replete with asymmetrical hierarchies that are motivated by consumption, exploitation and commodification. This paper examines the Philippines’ campaign, ‘It's more fun in the Philippines’ a supposedly grassroots initiative which sought individual contributions from the public such as memes that could help promote the Philippines. The paper finds that the linguistic and multimodal resources of contributions chosen for the campaign showcase a pattern of resemiotization: the use of generic expressions and concepts to present the ‘local’. Whereas the original intention of the grassroots initiative was to solicit a diversity of ways to present the Philippines, we find that the official choice of campaign resources has affirmed resemiotization as a linguistic and semiotic strategy of commodification – the repackaging of the local as a construct possessing material value. While much has been said about the use of the local for the global consumer, the paper describes through the lens of language use in the context of globalization how an avowedly ground up and empowering initiative eventually becomes enmeshed in the normalizing processes of globalization. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Discourse and advertising; Discourse and tourism; Philippine tourism; Resemiotization; Tourism campaign",,,,,,,"The paper was completed through the support of the visiting scholar program of the National Institute of Education, Singapore , which was awarded to the primary author.",,"Adegoju, A., “We Need More than Jingles”: Discursive practices of resistance in the Nigerian public's responses to their branding Nigeria campaign (2016) Discourse, Context Media, 13, pp. 106-113; Agha, A., The Social Life of Cultural Value (2003) Language and Communication, 23, pp. 231-273; Agha, A., Mediatized Projects for State Peripheries (2012) Language and Communication, 32, pp. 98-101; Aragon, R., It's more fun in the Philippines: the inside story from David Guerrero (2012) Balikbayan: Asian J.

Fowler Avenue, CPR 419, Tampa, FL  33620, United States","This study considers uses of the word mansplain as a phenomenon of gendered metapragmatics, or metalinguistic commentary related to male-female communicative dynamics. Mansplain (a portmanteau of man and explain), a neologism recently popularized on social media, is typically used by women to describe men speaking to women in a patronizing manner. However, the analysis of social media discourse reveals a wider range of meanings and uses, as users employ the word to critique, evaluate and/or normalize the appropriateness of other users' language. From a dataset of 200 Twitter and Facebook posts, the study analyzes patterns of the word's functions, showing how uses of mansplain not only expose varying beliefs about how men and women should or should not talk to each other, but also communicate affective and epistemic stances about the value of discussing other people's language use more generally. Some reactions to the prevalence of the word are observable in various usages of mansplain, demonstrating both acceptance and rejection of gender-specific metalanguage. For example, some use the term deliberately to exhibit metapragmatic self-monitoring (e.g., “Not trying to mansplain but…”). However, others who reject the legitimacy of the term consider it to be a linguistic weapon used to unduly silence men's voices. I argue that online comments using the word mansplain illuminate multiple sociocultural issues such as: how women, by labeling their verbal repression, are empowered to defy it through metapragmatics; how users retaliate against a gendered term; and how a word can be re-contextualized and re-appropriated transforming its meaning to reflect multiple viewpoints. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Gender; Mansplain; Metapragmatics; Online discourse; Stance",,,,,,,,,"Bakhtin, M., Discourse in the novel (1981), In: The dialogic imagination: Four essays by M.

We apply the framework of discursive news values analysis (Bednarek and Caple, 2017) to investigate how climate stories are made newsworthy through language (headlines) and image (pictures). We analyse 22 texts from the broadsheet The Guardian and 28 from the tabloid Daily Mail relating to the IPCC's 5th Assessment Report and find that, broadly speaking, the same news values are constructed in both newspapers, notably the ‘traditional' values of Negativity and Impact, often in combination with Eliteness and Superlativeness. There was generally a harmonious relationship between the verbal and the visual message, with language and image reinforcing or complementing each other. However, in some instances, and notably in the Daily Mail, there was a clash between the two meaning-making modes, e.g., involving Negativity constructed through language and Positivity through image. The paper also finds that selection of visuals to accompany news stories on climate change represents a newsroom challenge, e.g., when images originally produced as visual verification of a past event are used as illustrations of what the future may bring. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",,,,,,,,,,"Adam, J.-M., La linguistique textuelle (2008), Introduction à l'analyse textuelle des discours Armand Colin, Paris; Bednarek, M., Voices and values in the news: news media talk, news values and attribution (2016) Disc., Context Media, 11, pp. 27-37; Bednarek, M., Investigating evaluation and news values in news items that are shared through social media (2016) Corpora, 11 (2), pp. 227-257; Bednarek, M.c., (2016), www.newsvaluesanalysis.com, Coding manual for linguistic analysis, <>; Bednarek, M., Caple, H., News discourse (2012), Continuum London; Bednarek, M., Caple, H., ‘Value added': language, image and news values (2012) Disc., Context Media, 1, pp. 103-113; Bednarek, M., Caple, H., The Discourse of News Values (2017), Oxford University Press New York; Bell, A., The Language of News Media (1991), Blackwell Oxford; Boykoff, M., From convergence to contention: United States mass media representations of anthropogenic climate change science (2007) Trans.

One consequence of this is an increase in fathers who assume the primary caregiving role. The study reported in this paper involved a discourse analysis of 176 Australian newspaper articles that focused on primary caregiving fathers. Three recurring interpretative repertoires pertaining to primary caregiving fathers were identified, suggesting contradictory and dilemmatic accounts of this role. These were: (1) advocating for primary caregiving fathers, (2) comparing the past and present, and (3) barriers to father involvement. Overall, when describing the “typical” father who provides primary care, the articles promoted the evolving cultural ideal of fathers as involved and nurturing caregivers, however they nonetheless justified continued gendered inequalities in parenting. Therefore, despite claims that new models of fathering are encouraged and promoted in western cultures, the analysis demonstrates that media accounts construct and reproduce hegemonic masculinity. The paper concludes by suggesting that a more critical lens should be applied to claims of support for greater father involvement, as despite structural and social support in favour of involved fathering, this support is comprised of contradictory elements that simultaneously undermine this emerging ideal. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Contemporary fathering; Hegemonic masculinity; Ideological dilemmas; Involved fathering; Primary caregiving fathers",,,,,,,,,"Ammari, T., Schoenebeck, S., Understanding and supporting fathers and fatherhood on social media sites (2015) Proceedings of the 33rd Annual ACM Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems, pp. 1905-1914. , ACM; Billig, M., Condor, S., Edwards, D., Gane, M., Middleton, D., Radley, A., Ideological Dilemmas: A Social Psychology of Everyday Thinking (1988), Sage Publications Thousand Oaks, CA; Blackman, L., Walkerdine, V., Mass Hysteria: Critical Psychology and Media Studies (2001), Palgrave Basingstoke; Burkstrand-Reid, B.A., Dirty Harry meets dirty diapers: Masculinities, at-home fathers, and making the law work for families (2012) Texas J.

The song was controversial upon its release as many listeners felt that it implied that even if women said they did not want sex, in fact, they did. Such issues of sexual consent are a key issue for feminist analysis, particularly within current debates about ‘rape culture'. We investigated listeners' interpretations of the song, distributing an online questionnaire to over 1000 respondents. We found that most listeners either interpreted the song as relating to sexual consent and took offence, or felt that it was simply representative of the genre, and found the song unproblematic. However, a number of listeners expressed conflict in relation to the song, enjoying it musically but finding the lyrics particularly problematic. Our analysis investigates the language that respondents used to negotiate their relationships with the different elements of the song. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Blurred Lines; Corpus linguistics; Discourse analysis; Rape culture; Sexual consent",,,,,,,,,"Baker, P., Using Corpora in Discourse Analysis (2006), Continuum London; Baker, P., Using Corpora to Analyse Gender (2014), Bloomsbury London; Bates, L., Everyday Sexism (2014), Simon and Schuster London; Baxter, H., Coslett, R.L., The Vagenda: A Zero Tolerance Guide to the Media (2014), Square Peg London; Bushwald, E., Fletcher, P.R., Roth, M., Transforming a Rape Culture (2005), second ed.

The intentions of editorials are fulfilled most explicitly through the strategy of directives, where facts may be provided only to endorse editorial stance. A pragma-dialectical approach to discourse analysis assumes argument structures as speech acts which require careful analysis of text and context. In this vein, this study analysed directives in 90 English editorials, taken from two Asian (Dawn and New Straits Times) and one American newspaper (The New York Times), by looking at their form, frequency and co-text. The results indicate Dawn's stance when realizing directives as direct, NYT's stance was authoritative, whereas NST's stance was less engaging and more cautious. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Argument structures; Directives; Media discourse; Newspaper editorials; Persuasion; Stance",,,,,,,,,"(2005), Alhudhaif, A.M.

The analysis concentrates on two forms of group formation, spontaneous and imposed, and how different attitudes towards group formation are revealed in interactional practices. The findings show that in both types of group formation, the prevailing tendency among the Australian housemates is the avoidance of public group discourse, especially when it might suggest the superiority/inferiority dichotomy. In the British house, on the other hand, groups are frequently referred to in terms of them being popular/unpopular, with the unpopular group striving to reach popularity. Furthermore, unlike in the case of spontaneous groups, unwillingly becoming a group member does not trigger group identity construction and explicit membership claims. In both houses, a strong link to the original group identity seems to be preserved. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Australian and British cultural contexts; Reality television; Social identity; Spontaneous and imposed group formation",,,,,,"Universiteit Antwerpen","A larger project, during which the data for this analysis was collected, was supported by the grant from the University of Antwerp, Belgium.

In this study however, we focus on a different type of “Chat”: a newer social media discourse genre, and one that is a built-in feature of popular microblogging platform, Tumblr. These “Chats” are brief, imagined dialogues, posted by a single user. Focusing on a representative selection of 90 popular (i.e., highly reblogged) Chat posts, we illustrate two common strategies used by authors of creative Tumblr Chats: intertextual references to a wide range of cultural phenomena, and those referring to “relatable” first-person situations (i.e., “Me” posts). Our qualitative, interpretive discourse analysis draws on central concepts from Bakhtin, and shows how authors of Chats rely on creative practices, such as polyvocality and double-voicing, in order to produce posts that other Tumblr users are likely to find humorous, and/or relatable. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Conviviality; Double-voicing; Humor; Linguistic creativity; Relatability; Tumblr",,,,,,,,,"Angouri, J., Quantitive, qualitative or both?

However, since early 2014, that is, even before the treaty negotiations could lead to concrete output, the free trade agreement has been faced with protests from both sides of the Atlantic and from individuals/groups from various ideological backgrounds. This paper draws on a corpus-assisted approach to examine how the TTIP is reported on in the Austrian newspaper Kronen Zeitung (Krone). Among other reasons, the newspaper was chosen as a source of data due to its clout as “the most widely read paper in the advanced industrialized world” “[i]n terms of readership per capita […] (Art, 2006). Indeed, the newspaper's influence has remained steady at a readership of 40 to 47% (Meyer & Rosenberger, 2015). The corpus examination has found that the newspaper predominantly employs a nationalist discourse in order to elicit its readership's rejection of the TTIP. Apart from cultivating resistance against this trade agreement, the newspaper's reporting on the TTIP might affect its readership in (further) honing and normalising nationalist attitudes and general opposition against international cooperation. Moreover, the Krone might attract hitherto unreached segments of the Austrian population who, opposing the TTIP, are willing to join the Krone's counter-TTIP campaign and are then vulnerable to subscribing to the newspaper's more general discursive choices. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Corpus-assisted discourse studies; Kronen Zeitung, CDS; Newspaper discourse; TTIP",,,,,,,,,"Art, D., The Politics of the Nazi Past in Germany and Austria (2006), Cambridge University Press Cambridge, New York; Baker, P., Using Corpora in Discourse Analysis (2006), Continuum London, New York; Baker, P., Gabrielatos, C., KhosraviNik, M., Krzyżanowski, M., McEnery, T., Wodak, R., A useful methodological synergy?: Combining critical discourse analysis and corpus linguistics to examine discourses of refugees and asylum seekers in the UK press (2008) Discourse Soc., 19 (3), pp. 273-306; Baroni, M., Distribution in text (2008) Corpus Linguistics.

Using data from focus groups with 19 university students in London and Birmingham, UK and focusing on extracts from the data in which participants tell stories about their own experiences, this article explores how young British Muslims position themselves in response to negative media narratives about Muslims, particularly after terrorist attacks. The analysis shows that the media was seen as a driving force behind negative stereotypes about Muslims, and this resulted in pressure on Muslims to present themselves in non-threatening and welcoming ways to others, despite being subjected to covert and overt discrimination which participants felt in various contexts. Participants suggested that discrimination could be difficult to identify and quantify, and even when discrimination was overt, it could be illogical and incoherent, and therefore difficult to respond to in a meaningful way. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",,,,,,,,,,"Abbas, T., Awan, I., Limits of UK Counterterrorism Policy and its Implications for Islamophobia and Far Right Extremism (2015) Int.

As one instrument of enhancing soft power, media discourse bears material effects on the world through its choices in the identity construction of First Ladies. Combining corpus-based methods with micro-level manual analysis of English news from Chinese and American news sources, a comparative analysis of how the American and Chinese media construct the identities of Peng Liyuan and Michelle Obama is carried out within the approach of critical discourse analysis. The choices of key words, naming strategies, transitivity and metaphors in these two media reveal their differences in balancing multiple and mixed identities of these two First Ladies, in spite of their similarities in foregrounding the respective First Lady's celebrity identity. This demonstrates different understandings of soft power in Chinese and American culture and how identity construction of the First Lady contributes to the promotion of their soft power. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Critical discourse analysis; First Lady; Identity; Media discourse; Soft power",,,,,,"Lancaster University","The author would like to thank Dr.Veronika Koller at Lancaster University for the insight and guidance she provided in regard to this study.

Within the framework of sociolinguistic mediatization research, observable changes are linked to factors or trends that influence media development generally, such as graphic salience, communicative directness or reversal of aesthetic preferences. Rather than produce ultimate results about genre and multimodal change in popular science writing, the contribution seeks to outline a method for analysis which combines genre and illustration profiles, image types, multimodal rhetorical clusters and conjunctive text-image relations. The application of the proposed method yields clear results: Genre profiles broaden and typical popular science genres emerge; multimodal rhetorical clusters diversify and visualization generally intensifies; the internal structure of individual clusters shifts. Based on an exemplary exploration of the method, the present contribution suggests ways of refining text linguistic and multimodal research of the historical type. Direct correlations between observed textual and multimodal change and changes in media logic prove hard to draw, but large-scale studies are likely to reliably plot directions of media development and to pinpoint relevant influencing factors. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Genre repertoire/profile; Illustration profile; Mediatization; Multimodal rhetorical cluster; Multimodality; Text-image relations",,,,,,,,,"Abrahamson, D., Magazine-Made America.

This paper presents a practice-based perspective on multimodal document genres which feature typography and page/screen layout. It is argued that in order to reliably account for observed data, analysts need to distinguish between effects which represent an effort to create meaning, those which are by-products of production technology, and those which are intended as navigational support for users. A range of problems is identified, facing those who seek to classify multimodal genres, including problems of method, interdisciplinarity, naming, granularity, and exemplification. Additional problems particular to the study of real documents include design competence, dysfunctional genres, creativity and continuous technical change. Insights from design practice are discussed, introducing a pattern language approach to develop a level of connoisseurship and good judgement that complements the more formal analysis represented by corpus studies and taxonomy. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Connoisseurship; Design patterns; Genres; Multimodality",,,,,,,,,"Agnew, G.R., Writing backwards: the use of visual models in writing (1986) Visible Lang., 20, pp. 233-243; Alexander, C., Ishikawa, S., Silverstein, M., A Pattern Language.

I base my argumentation on the observation that image-caption-clusters have gained remarkable prominence in perception as they today often cover the entire layout space of a double-page, when they often appeared together with running text on a 1915 spread. Given that narrativization has always been a core popularization strategy of the magazine's journalistic practices, and is thus likely to be expected by its audience, the question arises whether perceptually prominent image-caption-clusters have increased in their degree of narrativity. In order to explore this question, I establish an interdisciplinary framework for a media linguistic analysis of literary journalism inspired by theorization in linguistics, literary studies, narratology and its cognitive branches. I proceed by exploring a corpus of altogether 15 National Geographic print feature articles (and their 304 image-caption-clusters) published in 1915, 1965, and 2015. I conclude this paper with a discussion of my findings. In particular, I draw on the framework of audience design and outline five main aspects magazine editors are at least likely to consider when making assumptions about their audience's genre expectations. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Audience design; Feature article; Genre evolution; Image-caption-clusters; Layout; Literary journalism; Multimodality; Narrativity; National Geographic magazine",,,,,,,,,"Abbott, H.P., Story, plot and narration (2007) The Cambridge Companion to Narrative, pp. 39-51. , David Herman Cambridge University Press Cambridge; Alber, J., Narrativization (2005) Routledge Encyclopedia of Narrative Theory, pp. 386-387. , David Herman Manfred Jahn Marie-Laure Ryan Routledge London; (1992), pp. 465-472. , Altheide, David L.; Snow, Robert.

The research is grounded in a Foucauldian framework that emphasizes the centrality of sex and sexuality. Our findings focus on two interrelated aspects of the data. The first concerns the features of the initial (anonymous) confessional posts, and the second relates to subsequent comments on the initial post. Close examination of initial posts offers insights into participants’ orientations to sexual acts, situations and beliefs that are treated as either normative or transgressive. Subsequent comments posted by participants reveal ways in which the “confessability” of confessions is interactionally ratified or contested. The findings thus demonstrate some ways in which normative sexuality is (re)produced, ratified, and contested within student online communities. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Confessions; Normativity; Online communities; Sex; Transgressions",,,,,,,,,"Bergen, E., Ahto, A., Schulz, A., Imhoff, R., Antfolk, J., Schuhmann, P., Alanko, K., Jern, P., Adult-adult and adult-child/adolescent online sexual interactions: an exploratory self-report study on the role of situational factors (2015) J.

Illustrated with examples drawn from news-media stories and other mediatized texts, I demonstrate what this looks like in practice through a three-part, multimodal analysis of “sexting” as a case in point. Grounded first in the linguistic and visual accomplishment of three familiar language-ideological strategies (i.e. iconization, erasure, recursivity), my analysis is then expanded to incorporate four closely related media-ideological issues (materiality, authorship, remediation, historicity) before turning to mode/modality and performativity as two key instantiations of semiotic ideology. While digital discourse studies should certainly not “forget about the words”, it needs always to stay attentive to the complex intersection of language with media and semiotic ideologies. This analytical principle has particular importance for critically-oriented work concerned with the way digital media are used to discipline, for example, sex and sexuality. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Digital discourse; Language ideologies; Media ideologies; Metadiscourse; Semiotic ideologies; Sexting; Sexuality",,,,,,,,,"Aiello, G., Woodhouse, A., When corporations come to define the visual politics of gender: the case of Getty Images (2016) J.

To support insightful analysis going beyond description and cataloguing, there is a need to make current notions far more precise. In this paper, I evaluate some of the more developed proposals made for characterizing relations between media to date and argue that a more explicit and refined semiotic foundation has much to offer. Only with such a foundation can sufficiently fine-grained theoretical and methodological tools be constructed capable of tracking both media evolution and media interrelationships in detail. The paper concludes that the incorporation of a particular definition of semiotic modes in the context of multimodality allows more discriminating characterizations of ‘media’ and ‘mediality’ in general. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Communicative medium; Intermediality; Multimodality; Semiotic modes; Transmediality",,,,,,,,,"(2010), pp. 37-48. , Balke Friedrich, Scholz Leander.

After a short discussion of user related push factors and medium specific pull factors and their interplay in computer mediated discourse, quoting in e-mail discussions is characterised as a CMD practice through which users manage interactional and topical coherence problems caused by technological factors. Retweeting, conversely, is characterised as a platform-specific variant of “sharing” digital objects which is afforded through social network sites. A formal and functional analysis of edited and unedited retweets reveals that this recontextualization practice shares formal properties with quoting but that it is mainly used for interpersonal rather than for topic- and interaction-oriented ends. The results lay the basis for some generalisations concerning the conceptualization and the interplay of communicative push and pull factors in current accounts of the adaptation of existing and the emergence of new social practices and genres in CMD. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Computer mediated discourse; Modal affordances; Quoting; Recontextualization; Retweeting; Sharing practices",,,,,,,,,"Agha, A., Language and Social Relations (2007), Cambridge University Press Cambridge; Bolter, J.D., Grusin, R., Remediation: Understanding New Media (1999), MIT Press Cambridge, Mass; Boyd, D., Golder, S., Lotan, G., Tweet, Tweet, Retweet: Conversational Aspects of Retweeting on Twitter (2010), pp. 1-10. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/HICSS.2010.412, IEEE; Draucker, F., Collister, L., Managing participation through modal affordances on Twitter (2015) Open Library of Humanities., 1 (1). , http://doi.org/10.16995/olh.21; Du Bois, J.W., The stance triangle (2007) Stancetaking in Discourse: Subjectivity, Evaluation, Interaction, pp. 139-182. , R.

They draw on existing practices of news reporting (e.g. employing news images with headlines, captions, and sometimes leads), yet offer new possibilities due to their unique features, which allow for large numbers of images of a single event to be published, and to be the featured medium of a given story. The combination of a new social context for the exchange of meanings and new potential for storytelling would suggest that online news galleries could be expected to be a location for the emergence of new genres. However, ‘new’ or ‘emerging’ genres in online news galleries are limited. This is due to a combination of factors, including the economic/commercial environment in which online newspapers operate, and the institutional practices by which galleries are produced. Drawing on datasets collected in 2009 and 2013, we identify and describe two genres, and one potentially emerging genre. Variations on some familiar genres do appear to be emerging in published online news galleries. The extent to which novel genres will emerge over time will depend on developments in the media landscape, and on the adaptability of the mass media institutions that author and publish them. © 2017","Genre; Multimodality; Online newspapers; Photography; Photojournalism; Social semiotics",,,,,,,,,"Bateman, J.A., Multimodality and Genre: A Foundation for the Systematic Analysis of Multimodal Documents (2008), Palgrave Macmillan Hampshire; Bednarek, M., Caple, H., News Discourse (2012), Continuum London & New York; Bell, A., The Language of News Media (1991), Blackwell Oxford; Boehm, G., Mitchell, W.J.T., Pictorial versus iconic turn: two letters (2009) Cult., Theory Critiq., 50 (2-3), pp. 103-121; Cambria, M., (2011), pp. 135-150. , Opinions on the move: an exploration of ‘article-cum-comments'.

In recent times, a substantial number of so-called “interactive” documentaries has seen the light of day. In this paper, one dimension of such online documentaries, namely the freedom of users to access content via different paths of navigation as well as to skip material, is discussed from the perspective that a documentary, in a necessarily subjective way, attempts to convince the viewer of something. Interactivity limits the maker's opportunities to do so. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Audiovisual rhetoric; Documentary as persuasive discourse; Linear versus interactive documentary",,,,,,,,,"Almeida, A., Alvelos, H., An interactive documentary manifesto (2010) Interactive Storytelling, pp. 123-128. , R.

It investigates whether the 'selfies’ that they share can be characterized as a visual genre and identifies four subgenres: presented, mirrored, inferred and implied selfies. The article illustrates the different ways in which the photographer's perspective can be represented in each subgenre. The aim is to show that the function of the selfie as a multimodal genre is not solely to represent ‘the self’ but rather to enact intersubjectivity, that is, to generate various possibilities of relations between perspectives on a particular topic, issue, or experience and hence to open up potential for negotiating different points of view. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Affiliation; Discourse analysis; Motherhood; Selfies; Social media",,,,,,,,,"Albury, K., Selfies, sexts and sneaky hats: young people's understandings of gendered practices of self-representation (2015) Int.

In this pursuit, it proposes analytical methods for analysing significant genre dimensions such as characters’ motivations and event developments. Several studies have shown how many aspects of television and cinema exhibit a reliance on genre and how genres operate within industry, audience and cultural practices. By applying the analytical methods of event and motivation in film, comics and novels, this paper unravels just how narrative patterns across these media have some shared generic identity, fitting into well-entrenched generic categories or incorporating similar forms of genre hybridity. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Comics and graphic novels; Film; Genre; Intermediality; Social semiotics; Transmedial analysis",,,,,,,,,"Alloway, L., On the iconography of the movies (1963) Movie, 7, pp. 4-6; Altman, R., A semantic/syntactic approach to film genre (1984) Cinema J., 23 (3), pp. 6-18; Altman, R., (1998), pp. 1-41. , Reusable Packaging: Generic Products and the Recycling Process.

The material under scrutiny pertains to social policy: we explore nine comment threads from news sites following a news item on social policy research concerning social workers’ opinions about the causes of poverty in four Nordic countries. The analysis concentrates on three argument types, all justifying the conclusion that Finnish social workers are rude. The argument types vary in terms of the obviousness of the link between justification and participants: The argument types of ‘personal experience’ and of ‘irresponsibility of those claiming social assistance’ display a rather clear link while the argument of ‘national temperament’ indicates less clearly who is participating. The analysis especially highlights the involvement of the most disadvantaged and the role of professional journalists. The arguments also refer to the discourses circulated, e.g. national stereotypes and the Nordic media discourse of blaming the social policy system while sympathising with the clients. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Arguments; Media; Online discussions; Participation; Social policy",,,,,,,,,"Albrekt Larsen, C., The Institutional Logic of Welfare Attitudes (2006), Ashgate Aldershot; Albrekt Larsen, C., The Rise and Fall of Social Cohesion (2013), Oxford University Press Oxford; Bench-Capon, T., Persuasion in Practical Argument Using Value-based Argumentation Frameworks (2003) J.

First, these forums are defined as a vernacular public discourse since users base their reasoning on private sphere stancetaking, and their views do not receive legitimation. Additionally, the participants comprise a hybrid public that shares networking but not necessarily a common ground on the topic being discussed. Second, news discussion forums are based on the communicative activity of commenting as they are initiated by a news article or other types of professional news content. They can be compared to content-based and knowledge-based discussions in social media, but they have their own specific characteristics. Third, the users do not necessarily reveal their source of knowledge, but when they do, references are of a general nature or they are anchored in the private sphere of the participants. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Content-based discussion; Digital genre; Everyday knowledge; News discussions; Public vernacular discourse",,,,,,,,,"Agha, A., Language and Social Relations (2007), Cambridge University Press Cambridge; Androutsopoulos, J., Theorizing media, mediation and mediatization (2016) Sociolinguistics: Theoretical Debates, pp. 282-302. , N.

This approach is illustrated in the examination of the release of a draft Eurogroup statement via journalist Paul Mason's Facebook, Scribd and Twitter accounts on the 16th February 2015. The analysis draws on small story insights (Georgakopoulou, 2015a,b,c) and the empirical framework of sharing (Androutsopoulos, 2014). It shows how the release of this leak event on Twitter is storied as a breaking news story unfolding moment-by-moment as it happens, at the same time as making up an incipient record of the event as it happened. It is argued that breaking news (micro)stories are shared as moments of narrative stancetaking, featuring a concise, portable storyline and cumulative evaluation(s) that foreground the relevance of the leak for the ongoing discussions on the Greek bailout negotiations as well as the continued importance of the journalist as the mediator of the leak. In this case of sharing a leaked document with networked participants, narrativity is drawn upon as a key resource for producing and circulating alternative stances on the Greek crisis, creating a range of networked participation positions.

In these fora, users often position themselves and their opinions in open opposition to broader cultural and social norms and contest mainstream media narratives, thereby also establishing an indirect link between public online and mainstream media discourse. Our study addresses two questions: Firstly, which linguistic strategies do participants use in order to construct themselves and others as members of a minority/majority culture and how do these constructed identities relate to mainstream media content? Secondly, how do participants position themselves vis-à-vis the mainstream media and what stances do they take towards mainstream media news coverage of long-term intercultural ethnic conflicts. To do so, we examine two threads from the public online discussion board UKDebate and one thread by the BBC-run Have your say, which deal with intercultural problems in the UK unfolding between UK-citizens and migrants and refugees from various cultural backgrounds. Our semantic analysis of users’ techniques of (self-)referencing and predication related to discourse topoi shows that participants use similar techniques when criticising mainstream media news-coverage and reception, but develop distinct group-specific patterns in shaping their respective cultural in- and out-groups. Furthermore, the discussions show similarities in the construction of minority groups between postings taking a majority perspective and tabloid news-coverage. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","In-group/out-group construction; Intercultural encounters; Mainstream media; Minority/majority culture; Public online discussions",,,,,,,,,"Atifi, H., Marcoccia, M., Follow-ups and dialogue in online discussions on French politics: from Internet forums to social TV (2015) The Dynamics of Political Discourse: Forms and Functions of Follow-Ups, pp. 109-140. , A.

Social TV corresponds to two phenomena: TV viewers have the opportunity to react to a program by posting tweets, SMS or Facebook messages, and these digital messages are integrated into the TV program. Thus, social TV is intended to allow users to contribute to public discussions and to facilitate the constitution of a transmedia and digital agora. This paper proposes an analysis of the tweets produced by TV viewers, selected by the program director and displayed on screen during the French political TV program Des Paroles et Des Actes, broadcast by France 2 on 6 February 2014. Through the interactional and pragmatic analysis of these messages, several questions will be addressed: what are the addressee and the reception format of these tweets? Who are the authors of these messages? What are the main functions of these tweets? From a more general perspective, this analysis raises questions about the participatory and dialogical dimensions of social TV and the digital agora. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Participation; Political discourse; Pragmatics; Social television; Twitter",,,,,,,,,"Alba-Juez, L., Thompson, G., The many faces and phases of evaluation (2014) Evaluation in Context, pp. 3-23. , G.

These insights have been gained based on the use of offensive vocabulary and un-hedged directness. The present contribution proposes a cross-cultural examination of commenting, comparing responses to opinion editorials in the internet sites of the Washington Post and its ideologically counterpart in Israel, NRG, three op-eds for each language. To do so, we (a) introduce a coding scheme which accounts for commenting, based on a distinction between agreement/disagreement, logos-oriented vs. ethos-oriented (ad-hominem and ad-personam) comments, and literal vs. ironic keying; (b) postulate a scale of threat to negative face; and (c) compare the use of the various commenting strategies in two sets of data, the internet sites of the Washington Post for American English, and the Israeli NRG site for the Hebrew. Findings indicate (1) a higher preference for the more threatening no-logos and ad-personam comments in the NRG data as compared to the WP, (2) similarities between the two sites in the use of irony vs non-irony, with preference for ironic keying in anti-ethos as compared to anti-logos. We discuss the implications of these findings in terms of the commenting arena in the public sphere. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Ad-hominem; Ad-personam; Disagreement; Ethos; Face-threats; Irony; Logos; Negative face; On-line commenting; Op-eds; Positive face",,,,,,,,,"Amossy, R., L'argumentation dans le Discours: Discours Politique, Littérature d'Idées, Fiction (2000), Nathan Paris; Amossy, R., Koren, R., (2010), pp. 219-236. , La <diabolisation>: Un avatar du discours polémique au prisme des présidentielles de 2007.

Over the last two decades and with the arrival of new media, this role has been undergoing changes. Recent cases of whistleblowing, such as WikiLeaks and Snowden, illustrate how contemporary media allow individuals to release data directly to the global audience. This raises the question of how recent leaks affect how journalists operate. In this study we compare how The Guardian covered two cases of whistleblowing which are commonly referred to as WikiLeaks and Snowden. We analyze how access to leaked data is provided or facilitated on The Guardian website, how readers are invited to interact with these data and how journalists present their own activities. A qualitative analysis of the leading articles further shows how the stories are framed and how much prominence is given to the data and the various actors. The results show how the roles of journalists shift from gatekeeping to data management, interpretation, contextualisation and narration. Journalists may no longer be needed to publish leaked data but they are still needed to tell the stories of leaked data. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Journalism; Mass media; Media discourse; Whistleblowing",,,,,,,,,"Allan, S., Citizen Witnessing: Revisioning Journalism in Times of Crisis (2013), Polity Press Cambridge; Bell, A., The Language of News Media (1991), Blackwell Oxford; Benkler, Y., Free irresponsible press: Wikileaks and the battle over the soul of the networked fourth estate (2011) A.

Blasco Ibáñez, Valencia, Spain; Taboada, M., Department of Linguistics, Simon Fraser University, 8888 University Dr., Burnaby, BC  V5A 1S6, Canada","Before the US midterm elections of November 2014, the well-known women's magazine Cosmopolitan decided to include politics in its contents. The editorial board stated that their aim was to encourage readers to vote and to be engaged with women's rights advocay in the election process. To that end, Cosmopolitan created a new website, CosmoVotes, with content ranging from discussion of political issues to endorsement of specific candidates who were believed to advance women's issues. Topics include labour rights, abortion, contraception, health, minimum wage and social equity. This paper evaluates the discourse of this new section of the Cosmopolitan website, together with readers’ responses, concentrating on evaluative language. In particular, we are concerned with differences between the editorial position and readers’ responses as viewed through the Appraisal framework (Martin and White, 2005), and the role that verbal processes play in the expression of evaluative meanings. The corpus used for the analysis consists of a selection of articles and readers’ opinions from CosmoVotes. The methodology is based on annotation of Appraisal features and processes related to the interpersonal dimension of meaning. Those features reveal how attitudes are evaluated and capture ideological positionings in this discourse. Our results show that CosmoVotes has special characteristics, such as a predominance of high intensification in the readers’ opinions, and strong negative judgements and expressions, while the magazine's pieces on political issues are more nuanced and eschew intensification. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Appraisal theory; Cosmopolitan; Evaluation; Opinion; Political discourse; Transitivity",,,,,,"Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada, SSHRC: 435-2014-0171","Funding for this research was provided, in part, by a grant from the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (Insight Grant 435-2014-0171).",,"Ahn, L., The official #CosmoVotes drinking game for the 2014 midterm election (2014), http://www.cosmopolitan.com/politics/news/a32830/cosmovotes-drinking-game/, Cosmopolitan, November 4, 2014. <>; Caffarel, A., Rechniewski, E., A systemic functional approach to analysing and interpreting ideology: an illustration from French editorials (2009) Revista Alicantina de Estudios Ingleses, 22, pp. 27-43; Cardellino, C., 9 gorgeous ways to look patriotic on election day (2014), http://www.cosmopolitan.com/style-beauty/beauty/news/a32713/american-patriotic-beauty-looks/, Cosmopolitan, October 31, 2014. <>; Chen, A., The human toll of protecting the Internet from the worst of humanity (2017), http://www.newyorker.com/tech/elements/the-human-toll-of-protecting-the-internet-from-the-worst-of-humanity, The New Yorker, January 28, 2017. <>; Cooke, M., (2015), http://www.thestar.com/news/2015/12/16/toronto-star-closing-commenting-on-thestarcom.html, ().

Addressee choices within a text message are conditioned by the user texting practices implemented by the radio station in several ways. First, the radio station filters listeners’ messages and does not text back. Second, texting is limited to a character length. Thus, messages have to be relevant but succinct. Study has revealed that texters addressed their messages one to another instead of addressing their messages to the radio station; this occurred in single and multiple-addressee messages. This finding suggests that listeners continue to address the radio station, as in classical call-ins, yet, these practices reveal the shift from talking to to talking through mass media. This research suggests that individual audience members’ engagement with mass media shifts toward interpersonal uses of back-channels that are not necessarily geared toward mass media content. I explain such behaviors through the lens of associational listening that fosters interpersonal talk. The emergence of messages that combines radio and user addressees resemble what we metaphorically call interactive content smuggling geared toward interpersonal interactions through a mass medium. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Addressee analysis; Italian radio; Radio; Texting",,,,,,,,,"Ames, K., Two hosts and a caller: analysing call sequences in a dual-host radio talkback setting (2013) Discour.

This matrix is composed of three conceptual frames that share the characteristic of presenting politicians as professionals in the art of lies, deceit and fraud: the first, DECORATION or MAKE-UP, identifies the world of politics with actions aimed at decorating, adorning or embroidering reality in order to conceal its true nature; the second scenario, COMMERCE, interprets the topic in question as a market of low value in which the retailer, the politician, makes use of often opaque strategies in order to camouflage their product and make it look like something which it is not; the matrix is completed by the framework DREAM or FANTASY, which portrays the politician as a person who adorns, covers up or ignores the things that they do not wish to see, spuriously creating alternative worlds that respond to their own interests. Drawing on a corpus made up of political opinion articles taken from the most widely-distributed Spanish newspapers, we analyse the metaphoric correspondences established between the conceptual structures that these focus yield, and the topic studied. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Conceptual metaphor; Delegitimisation; Ideology; Narrative; Political discourse",,,,,,,,,"Bednarek, M.A., Evaluation in Media Discourse.

It examines the discursive resources and practices identified in the group, as well as discusses how identities are constructed through hybrid discourse. Informed largely by discourse-centered online ethnography, we observed the group and its discourse systematically, and contacted the group members. Specifically, we collected screen data with a view to identifying the discourse functions and analyzing the linguistic resources deployed by the members. Semi-structured interviews, incorporating the elements of techno-biography and stimulated recall, were conducted to delve into the practices and identity construction. The study argues that the group is not merely an academic group, but a “social network-educational space” in that both academically-related and socially-related discourse functions could be observed. The members were found to deploy a wide range of resources such as emoticons for meaning making. This article then presents a case of a participant which illustrates how various identities could be constructed with the discursive resources and practices. It concludes by advancing our understanding of concepts such as the community of practice and considering the implications for future computer-mediated discourse research. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Discourse functions; Facebook group; Identities; Social network-educational space",,,,,,,,,"Aguirre, A.C., Davies, S.G., Imperfect strangers: picturing place, family, and migrant identity on Facebook (2015) Discour., Context Media, 7, pp. 3-17; Androutsopoulous, J., Introduction: sociolinguistics and computer-mediated communication (2006) J.

Situating PewDiePie within the greater media landscape to establish both his success and notoriety, this article addresses the local interpretation of the globalization of English and the use of English swear words in Swedish media. The practice of swearing in the gaming context is discussed, and swearing instances in a selection of three of PewDiePie's horror game videos are analyzed. The article puts forth the argument that the use of English swear words contributes to the performance of PewDiePie as a specific, online persona, one that is both in line with the context of video gaming and conducive to a para-social relationship, allowing PewDiePie to achieve the overall goals of communicating with his viewers as peers and reducing the social distance between them. The article concludes that PewDiePie's practice of social swearing not only simulates casual conversation between friends, but actively reduces social distance, creates the illusion of intimacy, and contributes to his unprecedented success on YouTube. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Para-social relationships; PewDiePie; Swearing; YouTube",,,,,,,,,"Adams, M., In Praise of Profanity (2016), Oxford University Press Oxford; Baruch, Y., Jenkins, S., Swearing at work and permissive leadership culture: when anti-social becomes social and incivility is acceptable (2007) Leadership Organiz.

This mode of address, however, is not uniform across institutions, or unchanging over time, but is a distinctive kind of practical accomplishment, dependent – in part at least – on the technological developments around the autocue or teleprompter. This article explores how the introduction of the autocue altered practices of television news-reading, and – by enabling a greater degree of expressive release by newsreaders – fostered a stronger sense of para-social interaction between newsreader and audience. These developments, however, are not simply driven by technology but interact with cultural and institutional pressures which we illustrate by comparisons between British (BBC), U.S. (CBS) and Chinese (CCTV) news presenters. Indeed, the adoption of and development of direct visual address in news reading, with accompanying forms of expressive release, may ultimately be seen as fulfilling a general communicative principle: “for mediated communication at a distance, favour directness over indirectness, informality over formality, and social solidarity over social distance.” © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Discursive change; Eyebrow flash; Mode of address; News reading; Technological affordance; Xīnwén Liánbō (‘News Simulcast’)",,,,,,,,,"Alba-Juez, L., Evaluation in the headlines of tabloids and broadsheets: a comparative study (2017) Evaluation in Media Discourse: European Perspectives, , R.

A Likert-style questionnaire that also included open-ended questions was distributed to 393 college students to elicit answers on how they relate to their mobile phones. Findings indicate that mobile phone users of different nationalities and genders perceive and use their mobile phones differently for self-expression and identity display, with Omani women most likely to orient to their phones as identity-relevant, and Ukrainian men least likely to do so. Americans showed more mixed results, with American women more prone to treat their mobile phones as objects that relate to identity expression. Further, while Ukrainians and Americans tended to view their mobile phones primarily through the lens of utility, Omanis tended to take a more affective/romantic perspective. To explain these findings, we demonstrate, following Al Zidjaly and Gordon (2012), that mobile phones are productively understood as what Scollon (2001) calls cultural tools, or the material and symbolic means people use in culturally- and historically-enabled and -constrained ways to accomplish actions such as identity display. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Cultural practices; Cultural tools; Gendered practices; Identity; Mobile phones",,,,,,,,,"Al-Harrasi, A.S., Al-Badi, A.H., The impact of social networking: a study of the influence of smartphones on college students (2014) Contemp.

Of particular interest is a canvasing of the motivations behind amateur use of the app for paid sexual encounters. More than six hundred comments from twenty-two relevant threads are selected for analysis, drawn from the popular ‘Gaybros’ subreddit forum. I nominate three key ‘scripts’ from the discourse. Namely, from the perspective of the individual seeking payment: ‘cash strapped student’ and ‘alternative to porn’; and ‘naïve millennials’ from a community responder perspective. These scripts offer insight into the profit-seeking motivations behind exploiting a popular sex-seeking tool, in particular by participants who would not otherwise engage in ‘cruising for cash’. The discourse supports my view that the young men seeking payment conceive of themselves as mobile pornographers, a concept that embodies their willingness to exploit the affordances of mobile technology and the profits to be gained from youth and sex, without the digital traces of more traditional pornographic forms. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Cultural studies; Discourse; Geosocial apps; Grindr; Homosexuality; Prostitution",,,,,,,,,"Aggleton, P., Parker, R., (2015) Men Who Sell Sex: Global Perspectives, , Routledge London, United Kingdom; Albo, M., Meet the gaybros (2013), http://www.out.com/entertainment/2013/08/07/meet-gaybros, Out, 7 August. <> (accessed 5 December 2016); Albright, J.M., Simmens, E., Flirting, cheating, dating, and mating in a virtual world (2014) The Oxford Handbook of Virtuality, pp. 284-302. , M.

By taking a discourse analytic orientation, this article joins this line of research, and delineates the situated and interactional nature of moral argumentations and rhetoric. The article focuses on the role moral discourse plays in the formation of the public sphere, as conceptualized by Habermas, and specifically on moral discourse (co-)produced by museums and by their visitors. As cultural public institutions, museums play an important role in shaping the public sphere both thematically (topically) and materially (communication technologies and materialities of display and participation). In recent years, museums have shifted to more interactive modes of operation, where visitors are invited to participate in the public sphere by producing discourse in situ. This study explores museum questions and visitors responses in a large Jewish cultural/heritage museum in the Unites States. The study first looks at the museum apparatuses, through which discourse is publicly invited, produced and presented, to then study visitors’ responses as moral discourse. The analysis critically highlights the dramatic quality inherent to moral scenes, and depicts and discusses how visitors’ texts selectively address the moral Actor, Action and Motive as parts of the social moral drama they evaluate. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Critical discourse analysis; Everyday morality; Habermas; Museum visitors; Public sphere; Rhetoric",,,,,,,,,"Adut, A., A theory of the public sphere (2012) Sociolog.

The main goal is to find out whether users writing in different languages constitute differentiated speech communities with different discursive norms or rather share the same norms and discourse habits. To answer this question, we examined 100 reviews for each language and analysed three features, namely the types of speech acts that they use, the specific topics that they evaluate and the extent to which they up-scale or down-scale their evaluative statements. The main conclusion of the cross-linguistic analysis is that there is a general trend towards similarity between the three language user groups under examination. We found analogous (although not identical) patterns for the three features. Within this overall trend towards similarity, specific divergences can be detected, for example regarding the status of positive comments in English-written reviews, or the status of the ‘interpersonal’ topic in Italian-written reviews. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Cross-linguistic analysis; Evaluative discourse; Online hotel review; TripAdvisor; User-generated content",,,,,,,,,"Barton, D., Lee, C., Redefining vernacular literacies in the age of Web 2.0 (2012) Appl.

With advances in technology in recent years, more advertisers are incorporating web advertising into their marketing strategies, often combining elements of both online and traditional modes of advertising to achieve their aim. As web advertising is a relatively new mode of communication, the present paper aims to explore the use of language in web advertising, using a collection of advertisements taken from the official Facebook pages of three gyms in Australia. Our focus is on imperatives which have been identified as a typical feature of advertising discourse. We provide a multi-modal analysis of Facebook advertisements by focusing on the role of imperatives in text and the interplay between text and image. Imperatives are often considered to be threatening to an individual׳s negative face as they express the directive force associated with commands and requests. Therefore, the present study aims to identify the dominant discourse function of imperatives in Facebook gym advertisements. Adopting the theoretical frameworks on politeness (Brown and Levinson, 1987; Locher and Watts, 2006; Park, 2008a, 2008b) and impoliteness (Haugh, 2010a; Haugh and Bousfield, 2012), we argue that while imperatives may occasion linguistic manifestation of impoliteness in their surface value, imperatives in web advertising are rather a strategy used by advertisers to create a sense of familiarity between the advertiser and receiver which is further emphasised through the advertiser׳s use of visual elements (such as image and video). The data is first categorised into two groups based on whether or not the advertisements contain imperative verbs. Using the discourse classification of imperatives by Pennock-Speck and Fuster-Márquez (2014), the advertisements containing imperative verbs are then categorised based on their discourse functions. Our findings suggest that imperatives in Facebook gym advertisements are used instead to capture the attention of Facebook users and inform them about the product or service. Furthermore, imperatives in Facebook advertisements typically occur in onset position and are accompanied by visual elements such as still images or videos. Thus, it can be argued that rather than threatening the addressee׳s negative face, Facebook advertisers focus more on appealing to their audience so as to increase the number of potential customers that are interested in what their business has to offer. The findings provide a basis for future studies on imperatives in web advertising and contribute to the understanding of im/politeness in online communication. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Facebook advertising; Im/politeness; Imperatives; Multi-modality",,,,,,,,,"Andreasson, J., Johansson, T., The fitness revolution.

This article adopts a discourse analytical perspective to examine the visual-discursive features of Internet memes in relation to the candidates for the 2016 U.S presidential election – Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton. Specifically, memes are analyzed in line with Van Leeuwen׳s (2007) framework for the analysis of legitimizing discourse in relation to how they de-legitimize. That is, the focus is on how memes attempt to create a negative view of the candidates and reduce their legitimacy as presidential candidates. The analysis reveals that the (de)legitimization strategies of authorization, moral evaluation, rationalization and mythopoesis are all evident within Internet memes. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Delegitimization; Discourse; Internet memes; Political participation",,,,,,,,,"Abulof, U., Normative concepts analysis: unpacking the language of legitimation (2015) Int.

Despite the asynchronous nature of the forum, we show how such identity work is accomplished interactionally through the use of online affordances, as participants position themselves and others to bolster their epistemic stance, or to weaken the epistemic claims of others. © 2016","Epistemics; Identity; Membership categorization; Online discourse",,,,,,,,,"Antaki, C., Widdicombe, S., Identity as an achievement and as a tool (1998) Identities in Talk, pp. 1-14. , C.

By analysing a TV interview to the son of Bernardo Provenzano, boss of Cosa Nostra, it is possible to understand how the criminal values and practices are maintained and reproduced within the father–son relationship. Specifically, we show how the son justifies, legitimises or denies the criminal actions of his father. The ideology of Cosa Nostra seems to be based on the inter-generational cultural continuity of its members, on the family as main locus of adherence, reductionism of its mediatic image, amoralism as father–son relational constant and verticalism of the organisation as key framing device. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Cosa Nostra; Discursive strategies; Family discourse; Ideology; Mafia",,,,,,,,,"Ana, O.S., “Like an animal I was treated”: anti-immigrant metaphor in US public discourse (1999) Discourse & Society, 10 (2), pp. 191-224; Banfield, E.C., (1958) The Moral Basis of a Backward Society, 3. , Glencol New York; Barbagallo, F., Dal camorrista plebeo al criminale imprenditore: una modernizzazione riuscita (1988) Stud.

In so doing, it aims to identify the manner in which China is constructed in the articles selected to be translated for Newsweek Hangukpan and to examine any discursive shifts in the Korean translations. The corpus for this study consists of two separate sub-corpora, designed and compiled using the same criteria and specifications: one sub-corpus consists of English-language texts published in Newsweek from 2005 to 2015, and the other sub-corpus consists of their corresponding Korean-language translations published in Newsweek Hangukpan during the same period. Since news texts produced outstrip the translations, the selection process is largely inevitable and only certain texts are selected for translation; and the socio-political principles or slants of particular news outlets affect which texts are so selected. In this context, the analysis reveals that Newsweek Hangukpan emphasises issues that are directly related to South Korea by prioritising, translating, and highlighting these materials, among other news available for translation; simultaneously, it distances itself from certain views advanced in the English source text by reconstructing the voice from its own perspective and using subtle linguistic changes whenever an argument cannot be applied to the South Korean context, such as by downgrading the marked voices in the Korean translations. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","China; Corpus-based critical discourse analysis; News; Newsweek; Translation",,,,,,,,,"Anderlini, J., Robinson, G., China-Myanmar pipeline to open in May [WWW Document] (2013), 〈http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/faf733ae-63b6-11e2-af8c-00144feab49a.html#axzz3ZGjgaJzD〉, Financ.

The main goal of this article is to show how traumatic events like this one can converge in a rather limited set of metaphors, ranging from easily recognizable topoi to rather vague interdiscourses that circulate in contemporary societies. To do so, we analyzed 450 cartoons that were produced as a reaction to the Charlie Hebdo attacks, and took a quali-quantitative approach that draws both on discourse analysis and semiotics. In this paper, we identified eight main themes and we analyzed the five ones which are anchored in collective imagination (the pen against the sword, the journalist as a modern hero, etc.). Then, we studied the cartoons at figurative, narrative and thematic levels thanks to Greimas’ model of the semiotic square. This paper shows the ways in which these cartoons build upon a memory-based network of events from the recent past (particularly 9/11), and more generally on a collective imagination which can be linked to Western values. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Affect; analysis; Cartoons; Charlie Hebdo attack; Interdiscourse; Intericonicity; Twitter",,,,,,,,,"Alba, Cecilia, 1977.

The multimodal approach employed in the paper combines the notion of discourse aims and the rhetorical and argumentative structure of Metal Gear Solid (Kojima, 1998), and analyses different narrative strategies and verbal cues, as well as the overall interface, control, and gameplay. The results suggest that verbal and textual cues combine with audio-visual elements and highly specific gameplay strategies in order to refrain the player from killing enemies. This might indicate that video games are likely to possess a great persuasive power, as they are both multimodal and highly interactive. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Discourse aims; Discourse analysis; Multimodal argumentation; Persuasion; Video games",,,,,,,,,"(1997) Aarseth Espen, Cybertext: Perspectives on Ergodic Literature, , Johns Hopkins University Press, Baltimore; Aarseth, E., Ontology (2014) The Routledge Companion to Video Game Studies, pp. 484-492. , M.J.P.

These kinship terms are commonly used in South Korean society not just to address siblings, but in a tropical sense to address intimates of superior age to the speaker, extending to romantic contexts. The paper demonstrates that oppa and nwuna become chronotopic spaces for negotiation between traditional Korean morals and gender roles tied up in the status and intimacy indexed by these forms, and new competing discourses of gender equality, free love, consumerism and enlightenment. Crucially, the analysis shows that the underlying kinship metaphors contained in oppa and nwuna play a crucial role in negotiating the balance between modernity and tradition, particularly in the depiction of sex and romance in Korean popular culture. By packaging romance and sex within the idiom of kinship, sexual desires and fantasies are rendered innocent and pure, or obscured altogether, thus allowing Korean popular culture to escape censure for being overtly sexually provocative. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Chronotopical; Gender; Indexical; Kinship terms; Korea; Popular culture",,,,,,,,,"〈http://seoulbeats.com/2011/08/aegyo-oppas-and-dirty-old-men/〉, Aegyo, Oppas, Dirty Old, Men, 2011.

Our results show that the magazine under scrutiny does not simply provide new forms of escapism but also positions itself politically in subtle ways as part of the traditional-conservative spectrum by reacting to metalinguistic discourses such as purism and feminist criticism. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Corpus linguistics; Discourse; Land magazines; Multimodal analysis",,,,,,,,,"Amann, S., Brauk, M., Kühn, A., Flucht in die Idylle (2012) Der Spiegel. 29.10.2012.; Androutsopoulos, J., Ethnolekte in der Mediengesellschaft.

The observer׳s paradox has been perceived to present significant challenges to traditional sociolinguistic researchers seeking to explore the processes at work during ordinary interaction. More recently, scholars have begun to argue that in fact the presence of a recording device, rather than being a mere constraint on spoken interaction, is in itself an interactional resource explicitly oriented to by participants (Speer and Hutchby 2003; Gordon 2012). Drawing on a collection of transcripts collected in experimental conditions as part of a wider project exploring the relationship between language and identity, this paper seeks to explore how these orientations manifest themselves in the context of Instant Messaging (IM) conversations. We show different orientations to the experimental setting, and different understandings of the role of the researcher – represented in this case by the IM chat archive – as both a topic of discussion and as a participant themselves. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Assuming identities online; Audience; Footing; Instant messaging; Observer׳s paradox",,,,,,"Economic and Social Research Council, ESRC: ES/L003279/1","The wider research project within which this work is situated was funded by the ESRC , Grant Ref: ES/L003279/1 .",,"Baron, N., Instant Messaging (2013) Pragmatics of Computer Mediated Communication, pp. 135-162. , S.C.

In a material of tweets containing or responding to explicit comparisons of tweeting to talking (N=520), a broad range of construals are identified, showing Twitter users associating talk-likeness with, e.g., notions of the textual representation of voice, of grammatical (in-)correctness, of accurately reflecting one׳s ‘real-life’ identity, and of regional or social variation in language use. These associations frequently serve normative functions, enforcing or contesting linguistic and discursive norms in both serious and playful ways. The findings offer a novel perspective on the oft-debated orality of computer-mediated discourse, providing a window on how a process of enregisterment (Agha, 2007) is instantiated and how language norms are actively negotiated by participants in everyday online language use on Twitter. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Enregisterment; Normativity; Orality; Reflexivity; Talk; Twitter",,,,,,,,,"Agha, A., The social life of cultural value (2003) Lang.

In doing so, we wish to make a valuable contribution to the debate in the field between ‘pure’ (see Schegloff, 1988; Emmison, 1993) and ‘applied’ CA scholars (e.g. ten Have, 2007). Researchers belonging to the former grouping argue that CA should only be used to investigate naturally occurring language use (i.e. spontaneous language use), while those who position themselves as ‘applied’ CA scholars maintain that it is an approach that can be applied to institutional and semi-scripted instances of spoken dialogue. We begin by outlining the principles of CA and the type of data and contexts in which it has been used to analyse spoken interaction in previous research; we then analyse and discuss findings from our own study into the verbal and non-verbal features of segments of film discourse. These segments comprise selected interactions that occur in three different scenes from three different films by Woody Allen (“Husbands and Wives”, 1992; “Melinda and Melinda”, 2004 and “You Will Meet a Tall Dark Stranger”, 2010). These interactions have been transcribed using CA conventions and then analysed in terms of four key conversational features that have been identified by CA scholars: turn-taking, adjacency pairs, gaps and overlaps. Our findings indicate that the interactants in our study do indeed make use of these conversational features in their spoken dialogues and that they are purposeful and meaningful. We conclude therefore that CA offers a valuable tool for examining key verbal and non-verbal features of film dialogue and paves the way for further analyses of this kind. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Cinematic discourse; Conversation analysis; Film dialogue; Turn-taking; Verbal language; Woody Allen",,,,,,,,,"Allen, W., (2004) Woody Allen on Woody Allen: In conversation with Stig Björkman, , Grove Press New York Revised edition; Alvarez-Pereyre, M., Using film as linguistic specimen: theoretical and practical issues (2011) Telecinematic Discourse: Approaches to the Language of Films and Television Series, pp. 47-67. , R.

Through a multimodal discourse analysis of cartoons and photographs, which have been collected systematically in social and mainstream media through hypermedia ethnography, it is argued that neolectal stylistic features, including body posture, clothing and negotiation style are the emerging themes that prevail in mediatized communication with and about Varoufakis. In unison, they create a sense of semiotic vernacularization, translated into interacting linguistic and semiotic simplification, boldness and unconventionality associated with a controversial and multidimensional personality with intense and impactful political, academic and popular activity. In this sense, the overall argument put forward is that this mediatized vernacularization is not only a linguistic but also a widely semiotic type of communication, which reframes and positions Varoufakis as a political leader brought to light through controversial aspects of his identity, leadership and politics. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Entextualization; Mediatization; Multimodality; Resemiotization; Vernacularization; Yanis Varoufakis",,,,,,,,,"Agha, A., The social life of cultural value (2003) Lang.

Previous studies have provided insight into virtual testimonies in democratic contexts. This study contributes to the literature by exploring the features of virtual testimonies in democratically restricted environments and showing how such testimonial narratives both challenge and are shaped by networked authoritarianism. Taking a “testimonial narrative” approach, critical narrative analysis is used to analyze virtual testimonies published by 59 cyberpetitioners on blogs or microblogs on the Chinese Internet. These speaking subjects are found to transform the Internet׳s digital networks into narrative networks by constructing virtual testimonies. To evade censorship, they structure their plots and characters according to a central-local binary opposition that allows them to criticize local government authority without compromising their expression of loyalty to the central government. These narrators are also shown to use the narrative strategy of creatively appropriating the “official rhetoric” to construct and occupy the subject positions of “citizens” and “the people,” thereby justifying their cyberpetitioning activities.

The transcribed sportscasts were first examined in order to reveal the different constituents modified by existing promotional elements and to discover the functions they fulfilled in the context. A careful analysis of the data yielded 8 different general categories that were modified by promotional components, namely players, coaches and their staff and referees comprising the first group, accompanied by spectators, competitions, institutions, the media, venues, the weather and miscellaneous features constituting the other seven categories. The functions observed in the reports were illocution markers, attitude markers and commentary. The study provides evidence that promotional metadiscursive features are an integral part of soccer sportscasts, and it can also be considered as a platform on which to further develop similar research prospects in less appreciated areas of inquiry. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Attitude markers; Commentary; Illocution markers; Promotional metadiscourse; Sportscasts; The FIFA World Cup",,,,,,,,,"Barnfield, A., Soccer, broadcasting, and narrative: on televising a live soccer match (2013) Commun.

In a context in which reality TV has become associated with judgement and rancour, we are concerned with the balance between expertise and ordinariness, and exploring the place of conversational and interactional styles we have come to associate with “sociability” and the maintenance of “face”, both in terms of pleasure and spectacle and providing a tactical basis for on-screen negotiation. We argue that these performances differ from conventional discourses of expertise as arbiters of specialist insight and market value, and offer new performances of expertise, based on a tactical mix of professional capital and sociability. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Antiques; Emotionality; Heritage tv; Language of persuasion; Mediated communication; Politeness theory",,,,,,,,,"Bonner, F., Ordinary Television (2003), Sage London; Brown, P., Levinson, S.C., Politeness: Some Universals in Language Usage (1987), Cambridge University Press Cambridge; Bourdieu, P., (1984) Distinction: A Social Critique of the Judgement of Taste, , Routledge London; Clouse, A., Narratives of value and the Antiques Roadshow: a game of recognitions (2008) J.

The study adopts a corpus-assisted approach to the study of discourse (Baker et al., 2008; Hardt-Mautner, 1995; Partington, 2004) and is informed by the notion of collocation analysis. Concordances containing the collocation of one of the terms migrant(s), immigrant(s), and Asians and a liquid metaphor were examined. A focus on liquid metaphors allows comparison with previous work on the use of liquid metaphors in the representation of immigrants. The analysis shows that liquid metaphors are used to construct mass immigration not only in negative ways as suggested in previous research, but that they can also be used to reflect the positive economic impact of mass immigration on New Zealand. The paper concludes by critically discussing the various factors influencing the representation of immigrants in the New Zealand context. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","CADS; Collocation; Discourse; Immigration; Liquid metaphors; Media; New Zealand",,,,,,,,,"Baker, P., Using Corpora to Analyze Gender (2014), Bloomsbury Academic UK; Baker, P., Gabrielatos, C., McEnery, T., (2013) Discourse Analysis and Media Attitudes: The Representation of Islam in the British Press, , Cambridge University Press New York; Baker, P., KhosraviNik, M., Krzyzanowski, M., McEnery, T., Wodak, R., A useful methodological synergy?

Research employing more naturalistic data is needed to explore the actual performance of refusals, particularly in those socially sensitive contexts such as date refusals and within a public domain such as the reality TV show. The present study investigates the under-researched topic of date refusals on reality TV shows in China. The corpus in the present study comprised 38 female date refusals collected from a popular Chinese TV dating programme over a year. It was found that when refusing a date invitation in the TV show, Chinese females employed a limited range of pragmatic strategies. Their date refusals were mostly realized by means of apologies, and reasons, and to a lesser degree through adjuncts to refusals (including positive comments and gratitude) and direct refusal strategies. In addition, the Chinese females demonstrated a preference for strategies of involvement politeness in their date refusals. The paper also discusses the possible impact of the genre of reality TV shows on the Chinese females date refusals. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Adjunct to refusal; Date refusal; Independence; Involvement; Reality TV show; Refusal strategy",,,,,,"15JJD740007","This study was supported by the MOE Project of Key Research Institute of Humanities and Social Sciences at Universities in P.

This is coupled with the widespread view that even women who do appear on mainstream comedy face the challenge of getting their voices heard in an arena where it is often the loudest voice that wins. In order to investigate claims that female comedians contribute less than male comedians on comedy panel shows, this article presents the findings of a sociolinguistic analysis of the British show Mock the Week, drawing on an XML-annotated corpus of the transcripts of series five. Rather than viewing features such as talkativeness and interruption solely as a substantiation of conversational dominance (cf. Brand, 2009), we suggest that these can also be understood as strategies in the production of humour in the context of comedy panel shows. In addition to genre-specific considerations, our results show that the use of these features on Mock the Week is influenced by an interplay of social factors, rather than gender alone. Overall, this study could act as a catalyst for writers and production companies to use more linguistically-informed approaches to comedy show scripting, particularly in relation to issues of linguistic and representational inequality. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Comedy panel show; Conversational dominance; Corpus linguistics; Gender; Situational role; Sociolinguistics",,,,,,,,,"Anderson, K.J., Leaper, C., Meta-analyses of gender effects on conversational interruption: who‚ what‚ when‚ where‚ and how (1998) Sex Roles, 39, pp. 225-252; Attardo, S., Humor and laughter (2015) The Handbook of Discourse Analysis, pp. 168-188. , D.

By using social media, nurses can participate in the debate and in a political process by drawing on narrative elements as responses to politicians׳ and healthcare managers׳ neglect of the nurses׳ situations. This article reports on a study of 50 topic driven blogs written by nurses from 2013 to 2015 and published on the website of a union magazine for healthcare professionals. Departing from a discursive narrative approach, the aim of the study is to analyse how the nurses narrate their working conditions and what they convey. The study shows that the bloggers create a we-ness by constructing and displaying their professional identity, illustrating unfair working conditions, conveying criticism and negotiating responsibility and blame. Addressing other nurses, the bloggers presume that others in the profession experience similar things in their workplaces and thereby encourage them to take action and make the injustices known. In order to gain credibility for the reported events and the relations, rhetorical resources such as factual accounts, categories, pronouns and a media discourse are used. The media discourse that is (re)produced in the blogs and elsewhere may result in nurses being trapped in their way of talking about their working situation, normalising it and having difficulty finding solutions. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Blogs; Discursive psychology; Narrative analysis; Nurses; Professional identity; Rhetorical resources",,,,,,,,,"Abell, J., Stokoe, E.H., `I take full responsibility, I take some responsibility, I׳ll take half of it but no more than that׳: Princess Diana and the negotiation of blame in the `Panorama׳ interview (1999) Discourse Stud., 1 (3), pp. 297-319; Bamberg, M., Introductory remarks (2007) Narrative – Stat of Art, pp. 1-6. , M.

Despite the increased importance of social media in the (re)production of discursive power in society, this is the first study of its kind. The analysis shows that Muslims are portrayed in the forum as a homogeneous outgroup that is embroiled in conflict, violence and extremism: characteristics that are described as emanating from Islam as a religion. These patterns are strikingly similar to – but often more extreme versions of – those previously found in analysis of traditional media. This indicates that, in this case, the internet forum seems to serve as an “online amplifier” that reflects and reinforces existing discourses in traditional media, which is likely to result in even stronger polarizing effects on public discourses. © 2016 The Authors","Automated text analysis; Critical discourse analysis; Internet forum; Islamophobia; Social media; Topic modeling",,,,,,,,,"Allen, C., Isakjee, A., Ögtem, Ö., Maybe we are hated.

The article relates sequences of dialogue between active users in this health forum from the perspective of digital literacy, informational support giving and rapport building. Taking into account previous studies on communication via medical forums, support giving and identity construction, this study develops and proposes some key strategies of explication of how knowledge plays a key role and is assigned to establishing contact as well as adapting themselves to other users of the forum. The role of epistemic parts in the forums is displayed through (1) encouraging further interaction, (2) bonding, and (3) attracting eligible dialogue partners. Skilful users are shown to share knowledge with each other in an informal, yet specific and substantial way. Posters are authored in flexible ways through a balance between knowledge input and emotional support giving. Knowledge is thus framed by the effects of the entanglement of epistemic and affective stances – not only by information exchanges. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Digital literacy; Epistemic discourse; Medical forum; Online forums; Peer support",,,,,,,,,"Akrich, M., From communities of practice to epistemic communities: health mobilizations on the internet (2010) Sociol.

Drawing the data from the responses of the Nigerian public to the Rebranding Nigeria programme as contained largely in letters to the editor, readers׳ text messages, and some headlines of features sourced from select Nigerian national dailies and one news magazine, the study explores the appropriation of the discursive practices of resistance such as framing, humour, negotiation of identity, configuration of alternative models, cynicism, parody and some other language games in negotiating Nigeria׳s national self-images. The study applies Fairclough׳s dialectical-relational approach to CDA which is based on the three dimensions of discourse, namely text, discourse practice, and social practice. The study contributes to existing studies on nation branding by bringing to the spotlight micro acts of resistance in nation branding discourse as opposed to nation-state based discourses which such studies have examined. In so doing, it demonstrates transformation of power relations in knowledge formations about national identity construction. It also reveals that schematic discursive practices largely deployed in organisational resistance could be appropriated to meet the contingency of contesting knowledge formations in nation-state discourses by the public. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Discursive practice(s); Nation branding; Nigeria; Power; Rebranding; Resistance",,,,,,"American Friends of the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation, AFAvH","This research was supported by the Alexander von Humboldt (AvH) Foundation .",,"Aboluwodi, A., Nigeria׳s image crisis and lessons from Obafemi Awolowo׳s leadership and education ideologies (2014) J.

The reform has resulted Chinese newspapers in facing an increasingly tightening tension between the political power of the government and economic forces of the market. Drawing on four different but complementary datasets – news policy documents, media editorial meetings, interviews with Chinese journalism practitioners and a newly constructed corpus of Chinese news reporting, this study found that maneuvering news values concerning different news actors and events constituted a distinctive way for Chinese journalism practitioners to circumvent the dilemma. To please leaders, the news values of Eliteness and Positivity were foregrounded, while to please readers, the news values of Personalization and Negativity were highlighted. The findings are important for understanding Chinese journalists’ mindsets to accommodate structural changes of Chinese press in journalistic practices. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Chinese press; Journalistic practices; Marketization reform; News values",,,,,,,,,"Allern, S., Journalistic and commercial news values (2002) Nord.

Conventionally, evaluation generally requires some form of expertise on the part of the evaluator, so to score a performance is to engage in a process of knowledgeable judgement, which is expressed numerically but also justified discursively. As evaluation becomes an increasingly pervasive social practice, no longer necessarily tied to specific domains of expertise, can any similarities be observed between the way that different categories of participants (those who are positioned as ‘experts’ and those positioned as ‘non-experts’), attribute discursive value to numbers when judging a performance in a competition reality show? How are these values articulated and framed across the different contexts for participation in each programme, as well as across different cultural contexts for the same TV format? In this paper, based on data from selected broadcasts from the UK and France, each with a different competitive environment (Strictly Come Dancing, Four in a Bed and Come Dine with Me/Un diner presque parfait), I argue that an understanding of relative values does seem to be shared across different contexts and among evaluators of different status, while being shaped by the specific mediated context of the scoring activity. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Competition; Evaluation; Expertise; Numbers; Reality television; Scoring",,,,,,,,,"Bourdieu, P., Language & Symbolic Power (1992), Polity Cambridge; Bonner, F., Ordinary Television: Analyzing Popular TV (2003), Sage London; Corner, J., Performing the real: Documentary diversions (2002), pp. 255-269. , Television & New Media; Coupland, N., Style: Language Variation and Identity (2007), Cambridge University Press Cambridge; Coupland, N., How frequent are numbers?

While academic expertise is typically promoted in expert news interviews (Montgomery, 2007), a questioning of expert authorities at the expense of lay discourses is a feature of several talk show formats (Livingstone and Lunt, 1994). This study analyses how doctor׳s expertise is performed in broadcast media, with a focus on ""the in-house doctors"". These are doctors who claim expertise as representatives of an academic profession and are affiliated as key actors (not occasional guests) in broadcast productions. More specifically, this study explores in-house doctors, and the changing forms of doctors׳ expertise performed in different genres of talk in three studio-based magazine programs from 1983 to 2014. The study shows a shift from the traditional medical authority performed in expert interviews and monologues of lecturing style (in the 1980s), to in-house expertise shaped by its orientation towards a communicative ethos and conversational qualities described in terms of the ordinariness of broadcast communication. The latter is mainly demonstrated in detailed analyses of the very successful show Ask the Doctor broadcast weekly since 2003 and with over one million viewers. In the show, the in-house doctor answers questions from viewers׳ letters. The analyses show how the doctor׳s performed expertise and epistemic status are reshaped in relation to: (1) the genres of talk used in the broadcast production; (2) the sense of inclusion in talk and gaze and use of personal forms of address, (3) the design of beneficial and responsible diagnoses and advice for the particular participant framework, (4) orientation toward both medical expertise, everyday experiences and lay knowledge. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Advice-giving; Broadcast talk; Communicative styles; Epistemic status; Expertise; Medical authority; Ordinariness",,,,,,,,,"Brante, T., Professions as science-based occupations (2011) Prof. Prof., 1, pp. 4-20; Broom, A., Medical specialists accounts of the impact of the Internet on the doctor/patient relationship (2005) Health, 9, pp. 319-338; Christensen, C., Sundhet på tv: fra laege til sundhedsguru (2013) Mediekultur, 54, pp. 104-122; Djerf-Pierre, M., Weibull, L., (2001) Spegla, granska, tolka: Aktualitetsjournalistik i svensk radio och TV under 1900-talet, , Prisma Stockholm; Ekström, M., Information, story-telling and attractions: tv-journalism in three modes of communication (2000) Media Cult.

Departing from the dichotomy between abstract, expert talk and the ordinary discourse of personal experience postulated in the 1990s, and the subsequent transformations of ‘ordinariness’ in current broadcast output, this paper examines the situated performances of citizens in a concrete political broadcast format at a particular moment in time. This moment is characterized by economic crisis, as the overarching societal condition which legitimizes ordinary expertize by endowing citizens with increased conversational rights, compared to what is typical of citizen participation in political panel discussions with an audience in other European contexts, and the entitlement to engage in authoritative forms of talk. By drawing on discourse analysis and conversation analysis of sequences of TV talk, the analysis unveils the rhetorical strategies, as well as the evidential devices and forms of knowledge projected in citizen talk. Finally, the article calls attention to the implications of these forms of discursive participation for empowering the role of citizens in political communication, public dialog and democratic debate. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Audience discussion programs; Broadcast talk; Citizen participation; Rhetorical strategies",,,,,,,,,"Blumler, J., Coleman, S., Political communication in freefall: the British case - and others?

While previous research has explored the relationship between the ‘lay’ and the ‘expert’ dimensions in various public participation programmes, this paper focuses on a TV programme format that is based on the cooperative interaction between professionals who differ in the extent of their knowledge and experience. The paper notes that while expertise is unevenly distributed between the voiceover, the presenter and the expert, these parties complement each other in explaining complex phenomena for the benefit of the audience. Using data from the documentary series How Britain Worked, I argue that as long as the presenter possesses some technical expertise, he may be positioned as a semi-expert between the true expert and the lay audience, even when he simultaneously acts in other contexts as a novice acquiring the specialized expertise needed for his quest. Thus, rather than demonstrating his own knowledge and skills, the presenter mediates expertise for the benefit of the audience. The mediating role is attested by the presenter׳s frequent shifts of footing in and out of the conversational interaction with the true expert, who may end up assuming a background role of expert support. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Broadcast talk; Conversation analysis; Lay and expert discourse; Participation framework; Pragmatics; TV documentary",,,,,,,,,"Atkinson, J.M., Heritage, J., (1984) Structures of Social Action: Studies in Conversation Analysis, , Cambridge University Press Cambridge; Bonner, F., (2003) Ordinary Television, , Sage London and New York; Bonner, F., (2011) Personality Presenters: Television׳s Intermediaries with Viewers, , Ashgate Farnham; Bubel, C., Film audiences as overhearers (2008) J.

Yet,this does not mean that we all participate in digital media in the same ways and for the same reasons. Nor does it mean that we all have the same level of access to digital networks. This article seeks to contribute to a better understanding of the diversity and fluidity of citizen participation in digital environments by examining the discourse style of a particular group of digital users, namely citizens whose contributions become crowdsourced to prominence in microblogging. We refer to this form of citizen participation as ׳influential׳, in as much as the discourse of these citizens attracts inordinate levels of attention and can trigger social contagion. We conduct a Corpus-Assisted Discourse Study of a corpus of tweets posted by a group of citizens who emerge as ׳influential׳ within a Twitter debate about the minimum/living wage. Our analysis reveals that their discourse style is characterised by (i) limited content originality but a high participation rate; (ii) a continuum of thematic engagement; (iii) high levels of emotionality; and (iv) a preference towards stance-taking acts that convey full confidence in one׳s views. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Corpus-assisted discourse studies; Social media influence; Stance; The living wage; Twitter",,,,,,,,,"http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/28/business/international/living-wages-served-in-denmark-fast-food-restaurants.html?_r=00, Alderman, Liz; Greenhouse, Steven.

Drawing on methodological approaches from studies of broadcast talk as talk-in-interaction and multimodal discourse analysis, the article examines the ways in which performances by advisers, advisees and an unseen narrator are made to work together to construct ordinary expertise. The analysis reveals that Lyxfällan׳s construction of ordinary expertise heavily relies upon experts and advisees both following and breaking the general norms of ordinary conversations and the sociability of broadcast talk (Scannell, 1996), as well as the more specific conventions of the participation framework (Thornborrow, 2015) of exchanges between advisers and advisees. In following and breaking these norms and conventions, experts and advisees jointly construct ordinary expertise through the enactment of a dialectics of resistance and compliance, which in the end is tilted toward the advisers. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Belligerent talk; Consumption; Indirect aside; Makeover; Ordinary expertise; Ordinary people",,,,,,,"This paper is part of the project Ordinary people on television [2011-1708], funded by the Swedish Research Council (SW: Vetenskapsrådet).",,"Aslama, M., Pantti, M., Talkling alone: reality TV, emotions and authenticity (2006) Eur.

In particular it explores the changing forms of audience address in one particular format, called the novice format, which is crucial to understanding the history of Swedish cookery programmes. Typically this format involves two participants: a presenter who plays the role of a novice cook, posing questions about the ongoing preparation of dishes; and a chef who carries out the cooking, providing expert advice by responding to the questions asked. The analysis shows that over time the performance of expertise goes from taking the form of conversational coaching, to being enacted through small talk, to finally arising through the simulation of an interactional give-and-take between the expert and the viewers. When it comes to the ordinariness of ordinary expertise, this development is paradoxical. In the later series of programmes, when the chef appears more like an ordinary guy, the distance between the expert chef and the viewers is reduced. But at the same time the cooking is decoupled from routines associated with work and domestic chores, and in this sense is becoming less tied to everyday life and more escapist in character. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Communicative ethos; Cooking instruction programmes; Multimodal discourse analysis; Ordinary expertise; Parasocial interaction.",,,,,,,"This paper is part of the project Ordinary People on Television [2011–1708] funded by The Swedish Research Council (Sw.

The data were collected and sampled in terms of its temporal development on Twitter. Drawing on the content analysis combined with descriptive statistics, the paper identified and compared the Twitter users as Journalist users and Ordinary users who are engaged with Twitter communication. It shows that Journalists tend to initiate the topic at the early stage of communication. Soon afterwards, the Ordinary participants dominate the Twitter communication. The tweets are textually characterized into three different categories on the formal grounds: Hashtags, Hashtags plus texts and anything with a link"" or ""a retweet"", in the heteroglossic context of micro-blogging sphere. The categorization of tweets contributes as a methodology to distinguish the discourse practice performed by different Twitter users. The results show that both Journalist and Ordinary favor to post the informative tweets throughout the sampled period. The quantity of interactive tweets is becoming less favorable; however, in contrast, the tweets on the indeterminate plane gain high popularity from the early phase of the period. Our comparison indicates that the boundary between Journalist and Ordinary seems to be indistinct in terms of their contents. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd","Discourse pragmatics; Hashtag; Internet meme; Journalism; Searchable talk; Twitter discourse",,,,,,"Universidade de Macau, UM: MYRG 133 (Y1-L4)-FSH12-MM","This work has been supported by the MYRG from the University of Macau [Grant number: MYRG 133 (Y1-L4)-FSH12-MM ].

This study takes a critical discourse studies perspective and contributes to a nuanced understanding of discursive power relations between companies and consumers on social media by analyzing the possibilities that corporate Facebook pages provide for consumer participation and criticism and for corporate manipulation of discourse. To do this, the study draws from Bakhtin׳s view of dialogue to shed light on contextual and discoursal features which operate to either promote or silence voices. We show how the features of Facebook provide methods for “monologization” making the discourse appear participative while still controlling which voices are heard. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd","Corporate communication; Critical discourse studies; Dialogue; Facebook; Online media; Power",,,,,,,,,"Baird, C.H., Parasnis, G., From social media to social customer relationship management (2011) Strategy Leadersh., 39, pp. 30-37; Bakhtin, M., The Dialogic Imagination: Four Essays (1981), University of Texas Press Austin and London; Bakhtin, M., Problems of Dostoevsky׳s Poetics (1984), University of Minnesota Press Minneapolis; Bakhtin, M., Rabelais and His World (1984), Indiana University Press Bloomington; Bakhtin, M., Speech Genres, and Other Late Essays (1986), University of Texas Press Austin; Barnes, N.G., Lescault, A.M., Augusto, K.D., LinkedIn Dominates, Twitter Trends and Facebook Falls: The 2014 Inc. 500 and Social Media (2015), http://www.umassd.edu/cmr/socialmediaresearch/2015fortune500andsocialmedia/; Barnes, N.G., Mattson, E., Social media in the Inc. 500: the first longitudinal study (2008) J.

This article presents a comprehensive literature review of 89 peer-reviewed journal articles reporting findings of empirical studies using CA to understand social interaction online. In this review, we describe who is conducting this type of research, the contexts in which CA has been used to make sense of text-based online talk, and where such studies are being published. We also identify the “fundamental” conversational structures researchers are drawing upon in making sense of online talk as social interaction. Findings show that studies are using CA to understand “mundane” conversational contexts, as well as institutional talk from educational, counseling and workplace settings. The number of such studies are increasing and are being conducted by an international network of researchers across a variety of disciplines. The data is most often described as synchronous or asynchronous, with a slow increase in attention to social media data. Publication outlets are mostly language-based and/methodological journals. Analysis revealed four main aims: (1) comparing online and face-to-face talk, (2) understanding how coherence is maintained, (3) understanding how participants deal with trouble, and (4) understanding how social actions are accomplished asynchronously. This review contributes to the overall understanding of the methodological development of CA, offering useful insights for those interested in using it to understand social interaction as it occurs online. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Computer mediated communication; Conversation analysis; Ethnomethodology; Language-based methods; Literature review; Online talk",,,,,,,,,"Adkins, B.A., Nasarczyk, J., Asynchronicity and the ‘time envelope’ of online annotation: the case of the photosharing website, Flickr (2009) Aust.

The study looks at an exemplary case of current multimodal discourse, in which written messages and images from broadcasts and press, as well as the comments and visuals that spread through social media, can be seen to relate to each other in framing public issues. To establish a viable perspective that takes into account both the communicative organisation and the semiotic constitution of such discourses, this analysis combines approaches from frame semantics and social semiotics together with recursive sampling and coding. The article then explains the analytical procedures used to reconstruct the framing of the accused as either a responsible culprit or a victim of circumstances. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Demjanjuk; Framing; Grounded Theory; Media frames; Multimodality",,,,,,,,,"Adami, E., We/YouTube: exploring sign-making in video-interaction (2009) Vis.

Building on an ethnomethodological perspective, the analyses are based on video recordings documenting the activities in which four target children, aged 6–7 years old, participated at home and in school. Through the detailed analysis of two mundane media literacy activities – online calling and word processing – similarities and differences in media usage within and out-of-school are examined. It is shown how children׳s media literacy activities encompass verbal, embodied and social competencies that are made relevant, and thus accessible for learning, in interaction between the adults and children in the form of norms and guidelines for what constitutes knowledgeable participation in media literacy activities, and that are appropriated and reactualized by the children in interaction with their peers. The findings show how the participants coordinate their actions on and in front of the screen and where spatiality and temporality are oriented to as crucial aspects of the organization of the activities. Moreover, it is demonstrated how old and new technologies are linked together in culturally and historically embedded conceptualizations of literacy. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Appropriation; Children; Ethnomethodology; Learning; Media literacy practices; Multimodality",,,,,,,,,"Bolter, J.D., Grusin, R., Remediation: Understanding New Media (1999), MIT Press Cambridge, MA; Buckingham, D., Beyond Technology: Children׳s Learning in the Age of Digital Culture (2007), Polity Press Cambridge; Burnett, C., Merchant, G., Learning, literacies and new technologies: the current context and future possibilities (2013) The Sage Handbook of Early Childhood Literacy, pp. 575-586. , Sage Publications London; Erstad, O., Sefton-Green, J., (2013) Identity, Community, and Learning Lives in the Digital Age, , Cambridge University Press Cambridge; (2006) European Commission, , http://europa.eu/legislation_summaries/education_training_youth/lifelong_learning/c11090_en.htm, Key Competencies for Lifelong Learning: a European Reference Framework.

To address this research gap, this article examines the multimodal discursive means through which the concept of “nature” is constructed in recent automobile advertisements in China. Following the analytical framework of multimodal critical discourse analysis, the article analyzes a total of 24 advertisements that were produced between 2013 and 2014 by four top-selling automobile brands in China. The data analysis reveals a consistent ideological separation between nature and human society in the analyzed advertisements: “nature” is constantly framed as either a valuable commodity for human consumption or an added value for high-end car models that in fact have low energy efficiency (e.g. luxury SUVs and sedans). Implicitly, these advertisements also appropriate the growing public concern on China׳s deteriorating environment through green consumerism. The above findings not only deconstruct the operations of specific advertisements and how they contribute to problematic environmental narratives; they also situate China׳s deepening ecological crisis within the broader context of neoliberalism, the ubiquitous doctrine underlying today׳s global economy. Overall, this article invites readers to consider the irresolvable contradiction of green capitalism and market-based environmentalism: the benefit offered by technological innovation is often offset by the endless pursuit of material consumption growth. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Advertising; China; Critical discourse analysis; Environmental communication; Green consumerism",,,,,,,,,"Budinsky, J., Bryant, S., “It׳s not easy being green”: the greenwashing of environmental discourses in advertising (2013) Can.

This study uses a Computer-Mediated Discourse Analysis approach (Herring, 2004, 2013) in order to examine a corpus of online grooming chat logs (c. 75,000 words) from Perverted-Justice.com. Results reveal the following idiosyncratic features: (1) a marked used of explicit and direct sexual solicitation; (2) a wide range of deceptive trust development strategies; and (3) an emphasis on testing the victim׳s compliance levels throughout the entire chat log and beyond groomers׳ secrecy and exclusivity establishing concerns. Online grooming is found to operate as a complex interactional network and to encompass different groomer profiles. To accommodate these findings, a new model of online grooming discourse is proposed. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Explicit desensitization; Online grooming discourse; Relational work; Sexual gratification; Speech acts; Trust development",,,,,,,,,"Androutsopoulos, J., Introduction: sociolinguistics and computer-mediated communication (2006) J Sociolinguist, 10, pp. 419-438; Androutsopoulos, J., Towards a ‘third wave’ of digital discourse studies: Audience practices on Twitter (2015), Approaches to Digital Discourse Analysis Conference.

The focus of the analysis is on journalistic adversarialness and whether there is measurable difference in the use of adversarial questioning between Chinese journalists and those associated with a free media system. Coding was carried out using a modified version of Clayman et al.׳s (2006) question analysis system, which uses content features and question design to assess the level of question adversarialness. All journalist questions were given a total adversarialness score. Significant differences were found between the level of adversarialness of questions asked by journalists from countries associated with a free media system and Chinese journalists.

Whereas earlier research has examined the language of support groups and institutional websites, attention is increasingly turned to the uses of social networking sites/SNSs for health. Our study examines the role of Facebook in the lives of users with type 1 and type 2 diabetes and the multimodal discursive practices they employ in their ongoing representation of life with a long-term condition. Through the longitudinal observation of 20 individual Facebook profiles, we focus on the dynamics of our participants׳ interactions, the interactional activities they performed on Facebook (individual contributions, group contributions, and ׳likes׳), and the multimodal resources they used to achieve these. The analysis reveals Facebook users׳ sensitivity to the varied social contexts that are collapsed within their networks as well as the strategies they employ to perform publically acceptable identities. Salient multimodal actions performed by participants include constructing personal expertise in relation to diabetes management, displaying the individual׳s integration into wider diabetes-related networks, presenting mundane aspects of self-management verbally and visually, and adopting a playful stance. The analysis situates diabetes-related SNSs practices within the contexts of representation and production, problematizing optimistic policy and professional rhetoric that anticipates a Health 2.0 revolution. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd","Health and illness identities; Multimodality; Social media",,,,,,"Economic and Social Research Council: ES/K005103/1","We would like thank the participants in this study for their time and their online contributions that they generously shared with us.

The aim was to determine to what extent and how compounds are used by fashion bloggers, with particular attention to creativity, and how this usage may be influenced by the online communicative context. Compounds are notoriously difficult to investigate due to their marked structural variation and inconsistent orthographic representation. However, thanks to a corpus-assisted approach, it was possible to first systematically identify compounds in the blog, and then analyze them in context to detect forms, patterning, functions and creative usage. Most compounds functioned as adjectives, in line with the descriptive and evaluative nature of fashion discourse. However, a high level of creativity was seen in compounds with uncommon structural components (e.g., verb+preposition as in go-to), novel combinations (e.g., skull-embellished), creative recycling of participial constituents (e.g., -inspired, -inducing), and especially phrasal structures that trigger striking mental images (e.g., stripper-cum-S&M freak). The study contributes to a better understanding of how bloggers use creative language to construct their identities as members of a distinctive and cohesive social community. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd","Compounds; Corpus methods; Creativity; Fashion blogs; Fashion discourse; Identity",,,,,,,,,"Aston, G., Small and large corpora in language learning (1997) Practical Applications in Language Corpora, pp. 51-62. , B.

It compares linguistic approaches to news values and discusses cognitive, social, material and discursive aspects of news values. Focusing on broadcast news, the paper illustrates how discursive news values analysis can be combined with analysis of attribution strategies. Analyses show how voices are integrated and how news values are combined and packaged.

They are often placed as spokespeople and represent the public face of disaster, be it anthropogenic or natural. A disaster also offers opportunities for a politician to participate in intense media coverage and build their profile. However, this represents potential conflict within the disaster management environment when a disaster response is being coordinated by senior public servants or emergency response personnel. This paper examines the observations of senior emergency managers about politicians[U+05F3] communication with various publics before during and after disasters. Analysis is based on interviews conducted in four countries, Australia, Norway, the United Kingdom and Germany. While emergency managers believe the involvement of politicians in communicating about disasters is important, they would prefer that politicians restrict their activities during the response phase of such events.

It is a sports programme that provides live updates and some commentary on football matches which viewers, for contractual reasons, cannot see. Accordingly, the void created by this paradoxical situation has to be filled by talk; but unlike radio, because this is a TV programme, the viewer is watching the talkers. The paper looks at two types of talk produced in this context: firstly forms of debate and argument (which like other types of sports talk have a 'sociable' emphasis); and secondly the subgenres of reports, commentary and updates, especially where these involve an element of narrative 'retelling'. The whole programme culminates in a classified reading of the day's football results, which in the UK, has become a weekly ritual of broadcast talk. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Narrative re-telling; Sociable argument; Sports commentary",,,,,,,,,"Boyle, R., Haynes, R., (2000) Power Play: Sport, the Media and Popular Culture, , Pearson Education, Harlow; Cameron, D., Performing gender: young men's talk and the construction of heterosexual masculinity (1997) Language and Masculinity, pp. 47-64. , Blackwell, Oxford, S.

Previous academic study on the program has considered the program from a range of perspectives but this paper specifically examines the techniques used by Tony Jones, long-time host of Australian current affairs program Q&A, to facilitate panel discussion and interaction between members and the studio audience. This paper considers the way Jones is skilfully able to transition between the role of host and journalist, arguing that these are two quite different roles. The analysis also demonstrates the way in which the audience members in turn orient to the role Jones plays, and suggests that this occurs through familiarity with the show's formula and consistency of approach by Jones. © 2015.","Australian broadcasting corporation; Broadcast talk; Conversation analysis; Membership category analysis; Political discourse; Q&A",,,,,,,"I would like to acknowledge the work of research assistant Amy Johnson in the initial stages of this research, and feedback provided by colleagues at the Media Talk seminar held in Brisbane, 2014.",,"Q&A goes live across Australia on ABC News 24 (Blog) (2010), http://blogs.abc.net.au/abc_tv/2010/10/qa-goes-live-across-australia-on-abc-news-24.html; Ames, K., Host/host conversations: analysing moral and social order in talk on commercial radio (2012) Media Int.

In this paper we unpack the practical production of the pool interview as a delamination of the interview-as-lived from the interview-as-media-production-mechanism. We then explore professional and public understanding (or lack thereof) of exposure of this delamination issue and its relation to politics. While the controversy did not directly affect Miliband[U+05F3]s position as leader, it is clear that the Internet is a dangerous place for the old rules of mediatization. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Mediatization; News commentary; Politics; Pool interviews; Social media; Visual text analytics",,,,,,"Griffith University

Ekström and Kroon Lundell, 2011; Montgomery, 2008). Methods that can visually represent interviews in their entirety have the potential to assist in tracking and tracing genre shifts within a single interview. In this paper we examine traditional genres and hybrid forms of broadcast interviewing using a visual text analytic software Discursis (. Angus et al., 2013, 2012a, 2012b). Discursis provides visual representations of whole interviews at-a-glance as well as the ability to focus into particular sections for closer analysis. Drawing on a corpus of 101 interviews from a single television program, this study examines if Discursis can meaningfully visually represent forms of interviewing genres (. Montgomery, 2008) and highlight where shifting techniques (.

This has been associated with ongoing trends towards a more informal style of public discourse, and with the construction of more equal relationships between writers and readers, which may be either ideologically or economically motivated. This analysis of all the instances of ""you"" in Guardian editorials for 2011 brings to light several different ways in which the writer employs the second person. Although the primary motivation appears to be epideictic, in that the writer seeks to forge strong bonds with the readership and thereby strengthen the sense of communion and shared values, some other uses are identified, including dramatisation and irony. This leads on to consideration of the type of reader constructed by these uses of ""you"", and the relationships projected between writer/newspaper, reader, and other entities. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Dialogicality; Discourse analysis; Editorials; Epideictics; Media language; Personal pronouns",,,,,,"Ministerio de Economía y Competitividad: FFI2012-36309","This research was conducted within the project “Metadiscurso y lenguaje evaluativo: perspectivas teóricas y de análisis en el discurso periodístico”, supported by the Ministerio de Economía y Competitividad [ FFI2012-36309 ].

In this paper, Facebook Graph Search will be introduced and a pilot study in computer-mediated communication and Fiji English will demonstrate the suitability of Graph Search for exploratory research in a speech community. The pilot study shows that there are differences in language choice based on age and context of use: English is preferred over local indigenous languages by younger users and in wall posts. The data further revealed not only the use of typical CMC features, but also locally influenced features and spellings. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Computer-mediated Communication; Facebook; Fiji English; Graph Search; Methodology",,,,,,,,,"Androutsopoulos, J., Neue Medien - neue Schriftlichkeit?

Using Lefebvre's (1995) framework regarding spaces of representation as sites of political struggle, I analyze how selective refuseniks construct the Territories as a space of pollution, irrationality, disorder and death, expressing fear that these qualities might contaminate Israeli space, and thus implicitly promoting a separatist logic of exclusion. Refuseniks employ metaphors of movement to portray the transition from 'here' to 'there' as a shift into an alternate universe, and attempt to appropriate hegemonic discursive conceptualizations associated with three culturally loaded spaces: the prison, the Jewish settlements, and Nazi Germany. The ambivalent dialectics of dominant and resistant ideologies in refuseniks' discourse and their cultural implications are discussed. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Conscientious objection; Critical discourse analysis; Israel; Palestine; Refuseniks; Space",,,,,,,,,"Asher, I., Thanks to the refuseniks we will eventually leave Gaza (2004) Ma'ariv, 7. , May (daily newspaper article), (Hebrew); Ben-Ari, E., Bilu, Y., (1997) Grasping Land: Space and Place in Contemporary Israeli Discourse and Experience, , State University of New York Press, Albany, (Eds.); Ben-Eliezer, U., Civil society and military society in Israel: neo-militarism and anti-militarism in the post-hegemonic era (2003) In The Name of Security: The Sociology of Peace and War in Israel in Changing Times, pp. 29-76. , University of Haifa Press/Pardes, Haifa, (Hebrew), M.

This article examines the norms and practices of celebrity talk show interviewing through a comparative analysis of journalistic or news interviewing. Data are drawn from four popular celebrity talk shows and three news interview programs in the U.S. The paper identifies two norms that guide talk show interactions and distinguish them from news interviews. The first norm is personalization, which allows hosts to use their own experiences and interests as a resource for questioning and responding to their guests. The second is congeniality, which fosters a predominantly friendly interviewing environment that enables guests to present both themselves and the product they are there to promote in a positive light. Although the paper is primarily concerned with elucidating these interactional norms and their implementation, it also addresses the mix of occupational concerns and market pressures that they reflect, and broader implications for the changing media landscape. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Conversation analysis; Interaction; Interviewing; Talk shows",,,,,,,,,"Allan, S., (1999) News Culture, , Open University Press, Buckingham; Baum, M.A., Sex, lies and war: how soft news brings foreign policy to the inattentive public (2002) Am.

Using my social genre/cognitive genre model as the analytical framework (Bruce, 2008a), I examined a sample of 30 examples of Toynbee[U+05F3]s column in terms of the knowledge elements of context, epistemology, writer stance, content structuring and cognitive genres (text types). I found that, Toynbee[U+05F3]s challenge to neoliberalism is two-pronged, involving the use of key generic elements to communicate themes that broadly fall within the areas of critique of the neoliberal shrinking of the state and advocacy of policy alternatives to strengthen social democracy and help the disadvantaged. Concerned with the embedded nature of neoliberalism in the British national psyche, which is reinforced by the powerful media organs, Toynbee, through her column presents a forceful, vigorous challenge to this prevailing ideology, a challenge achieved through a complex, discourse-constructing task. That complexity is revealed by the genre analysis undertaken here. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Cognitive genre; Discourse; Ideology; Neoliberalism; Social genre; Text",,,,,,"National Health Insurance Service, NHIC","Each commentary addresses an issue, current at the time of writing, related to a particular social or political issue in the United Kingdom. Examples include cuts to the funding of the National Health Service, the housing crisis, performance pay for teachers, immigration, welfare cuts, the Government’s austerity policies and a referendum on Europe (see Appendix A for a full list of the texts). Two types of schematic knowledge are drawn upon in each commentary. The first is detailed knowledge of the particular issue being raised in the text, and the second is knowledge invoked by the metaphorical imagery used in constructing and lending weight to the writer׳s argumentation about the issue. In relation to the subject matter of each article, the types of knowledge involved include current British political issues, including the current legislative agenda, 20th century political history (such as the Atlee and the Thatcher eras), the careers of current and past British politicians and the occasional non-British issue, such as the case of Edward Snowden. In relation to types of knowledge activated by metaphorical references in the column, there are specific text-external references, to British social history, as in “not Jarrow marching into the news” (Text 12), literature –“want children Gradgrinded” (Text 8), and world affairs – “to be Belarus” (Text 5) or historical events – “the Berlin Wall moment” (Text 9). However, the vast majority of metaphors involve original imagery constructed by the writer herself. Examples of this type of original device are “George Osborne׳s palanquin was born aloft” (Text 9) and, referring to Thatcherls funeral, “her apotheosis with full military honours” (Text 11). The writer׳s use of metaphor is dependent on the reader׳s awareness of the literary, poetic, historical or cultural knowledge referred to, such as the types of schematic knowledge instantiated by words like apotheosis, palanquin and tumbril. The use of metaphorical knowledge is a central element in constructing writer stance, and is addressed further when reporting that part of the findings. 3.1.2",,"Alvesson, M., Karreman, D., Varieties of discourse: On the study of organizations through discourse analysis (2000) Hum.

The qualitative analysis is based on the corpus of 1000 tweets sampled from the timelines of 11 Anglophone users. The users form a diffuse community united by an interest in ballet as a physical activity and an art. Storytelling emerged as one of important tools for identity construction, although Twitter stories differ from a prototypical narrative on several levels. These differences are examined from three theoretical angles: the structural approach (Labov and Waletzky, 1967. Narrative analysis: oral versions of personal experience. In: Helm, J. (Ed.), Essays on the Verbal and Visual Arts. Proceedings of the 1966 Annual Spring Meeting. Distributed by the University of Washington Press, Seattle, pp. 12-44), the dimensional approach (Ochs and Capps, 2001. Living Narrative: Creating Lives in Everyday Storytelling. Cambridge, MA, Harvard UP), and the small stories framework (Georgakopoulou, 2007a. Small Stories, Interaction and Identities. Benjamins, Amsterdam). Along with multi-tweet stories that can be analysed into orientation, complication, evaluation and resolution, two kinds of stories typical for the eyewitness microgenre were present. The first of these is a delayed resolution narrative, i.e. live commentary that obtains the integrity of a single narrative only post-factum. The second type is a tiny story, i.e. a fragmentary, minimally newsworthy report on everyday activities with unclear narrative stance. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Breaking news; Microblogs; Narrative; Small stories; Social media; Twitter",,,,,,,,,"Arendholz, J., ""Neeed to put this out there (My Story)"" narratives in message boards (2010) Narrative Revisited.

Analyzing the proportion of references to recency compared with references to remoteness in these texts, an overall trend toward remoteness was found, which diverges from earlier findings about temporality in other types of social media, such as Facebook and Twitter. Further considering specific examples from three of the five review sites (Yelp, Amazon, and Epicurious), this paper offers insights into how both the remote past and the present are variably deployed as discursive resources by the authors of these online texts. In addition, the study[U+05F3]s findings reveal that whereas lexical resources are used to refer to the present/recent past, references to the remote past rely much more on grammatical resources. Consequently, in order to provide a more complete account of time reference, I argue that it is important to consider a broader range of linguistic features (e.g., grammatical aspect, prepositional phrases) rather than concentrating exclusively on temporal adverbs when making claims about temporality in social media. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Electronic word of mouth; Online reviews; Social media; Temporality; Time reference",,,,,,,,,"Androutsopoulos, J., Online data collection (2013) Data Collection in Sociolinguistics: Methods and Applications, pp. 237-249. , Continuum, London, UK, C.

Coming from countries of origin in sub-Saharan Africa, its members form a network with an increasing global significance, with the largest hubs in the US and the UK. Despite or because of the high mobility of its representatives, their discourses about place, and in particular specific urban spaces, are charged with social and symbolic meaning. NAD members show strong and overt stances toward the cities they are affiliated with, so that localities become anchors for displaying sociolinguistic identity. This tendency is especially pronounced and on-record in the digital diaspora, i.e. in online discourse produced in diasporic web forums or on social media. Early sociolinguistic approaches to computer-mediated communication (CMC) had largely disregarded the notions of geographic place and locally anchored identity by focusing on the concept of anonymous users in an abstract, dislocated cyberspace. However, through the rise of social media and mobile devices, the notion of place and (urban) space is emerging in the analysis of digital discourse. This study builds on this growing tendency by exploring linguistic representations of urban space in the digital NAD. The approach is based on a large-scale corpus representing the Nigerian digital diaspora, downloaded from the online discussion forum nairaland.com. In this resource, the social meaning of urban space and its representations are explored both in terms of linguistic encoding strategies and with regard to emerging themes. Corpus-based text analysis is used to detect linguistic patterns of symbolic de/valoring of specific places (e.g. proximal deictic anchoring through here in x constructions, as well as the use of affectionate place names such as Naija or Chitown). In addition, qualitative close-reading of the material reveals emerging themes that represent recurring stances toward place within the community. In sum, our study provides a thorough and methodologically varied overview of sociolinguistic representations of place in a globally mobile community of practice, and in particular of the importance of place concepts in digital diasporas. It thus contributes to a better understanding of the sociolinguistics of CMC and its emerging focus on place and space. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Computer-mediated communication; Deictic anchoring; Digital diaspora; New African Diaspora; Place; Toponyms",,,,,,"Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG: MA 1652/9

Within the context of Facebook, all kinds of material posted on one[U+05F3]s profile, be that photos, stories and experiences, are organised in the form of a Timeline with time-stamps being appended automatically. Yet, the sense of identity linked to time is actively constructed in the posts, and is done in interaction with other people. Viewing time as a polysemous entity (Evans, 2005) and as a significant orientation device for the self (Georgakopoulou, 2003), this paper examines the ways in which Facebook users position themselves in time as well as the different ways in which they conceive and value age. Drawing on insights from discourse-centred online ethnography (Androutsopoulos, 2008), the frameworks of age-categorisation and temporal framing on identity marking (Coupland et al., 1991) and research on small stories (Georgakopoulou, 2007; Page, 2010), I present and discuss empirical data from a Greek female user[U+05F3]s Timeline. Focusing on instances of explicit and implicit references to age and ageing, I argue that age identity is an interactive and collaborative process both facilitated and hindered by certain Facebook configurations. The findings also show that Facebook can be divorced from its orientation to the present as participants utilise the medium to evoke certain periods of life, recycle memories, appeal to experiences and recall past tastes. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Age; Discourse-centred online ethnography; Facebook; Identity; Time",,,,,,,,,"Aapola, S., Exploring dimensions of age in young people's lives.

This is despite extensive theorizing of time and space/place in media & cultural studies on the one hand and, on the other hand, despite a thriving line of (socio)linguistic inquiry into how physical time and space/place are made socio-culturally meaningful in specific communication acts. In the light of this, I outline the main aims and motivations for bringing together emerging discourse and sociolinguistic perspectives on communicating time and space/place in digital media, with this collection of papers. In discussing the seven contributions and their methodological and analytical commonalities but also diversity, I show how they attend to the linguistic and multi-modal choices with which digital media users and producers orient to, negotiate, foreground or challenge aspects of the here & now as well as of any other places and times invoked in their communication. In addition to this, all contributions interrogate the ways in which semiotic choices related to time and place shape and are informed by individuals' identities, audience assumptions & the (re)formation of online communities. The main themes in this respect include:. -Communicating time and place of private experiences in (semi)-public forums with a potential for unknown and multiple audiences to tune in and become part of the communication;-Creating co-presence and reaffirming relationships and communities through discourse activities of marking or evoking time and place;-The often competing inter-relations between online and offline time and place;-The interdependence between the spatial architecture of digital media environments and any communication acts in them, which often involves a process of turning online spaces into inhabited places.I claim that all contributions demonstrate the need for conceptual and analytical tools and methods that are well-suited to capturing multi-layered arrangements of communicating time and place in digital environments. © 2015 .","Communities; Digital media; Localization - temporalization; Online-offline worlds; Sharing; Time-place/space",,,,,,,,,"Arminen, I., Intensification of time-space geography (2011) The Reconstruction of Space and Time: Mobile Communication Practices, 1, pp. 1-89. , Transaction Publishers, New Jersey; Auer, P., Schmidt, J.E., (2010) Language and Space: An International Handbook of Linguistic Variation, , de Gruyter, Berlin, New York, (Eds.); Bauman, R., Briggs, C., Poetics and performances as critical perspectives on language and social life (1990) Annu.

The interactants respond in various ways to this context but they also discursively create various spaces in their interaction. They negotiate spatial orientation through the use of linguistic deictic elements, create co-presence and joint attention through the gestures and positioning of their avatars and they need to handle screen space as well as the physical space of their surrounding. We discuss the theoretical underpinnings of the interdependence of interaction and space and its application to one specific virtual world, Second Life. We focus on a group of newbies, who participated in a workshop to experience computer-mediated communication in a virtual world and had to engage in classroom interaction and independent group work. We discuss how the participants try to organize themselves in the virtual reality of Second Life, while situated in different locations in the physical world, and we demonstrate how the interactants rely on space for their orientation and interaction within the virtual world and how the physical world is brought into the online interaction. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Computer-mediated communication; Interaction; Second Life; Space; Virtual worlds",,,,,,,,,"Abdullah, A.R., Second Life: language and virtual identity (2015) Routledge Handbook of Language and Digital Communication, pp. 273-288. , Routledge, London, A.

YouTube videos such as spoofs, memes, remixes, and mashups, form typical instances of rescripting, but other verbal activities should also be recognized as part of this practice, e.g. circulars of jokes about an incident on online blogs. Using as a case study a critical moment incident related to the Greek crisis that was repeatedly shared in social media, I examine rescripting as it occurs in the intersections between story making and social media affordances, arguing that it can productively open up the current sociolinguistic focus on resemiotizations of circulated activities. I show how changes in the place of the taleworld ultimately lead to changes in emplotment on the basis of the spatial semiotic repertoires associated with the new settings. Participation frameworks are decisively shaped by these changes, as commenters mainly engage with the current tale and telling, going along with the ostensibly 'fictional' scenarios and engaging in active storytelling, that is, creating further plots on their basis. I discuss the implications of rescripting place for the study of sharing practices and vernacular participation as well as for the study of place as constitutive of narrative plots. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Mashups; Participation frameworks; Rescripting; Resemiotization; Spoofs; Taleworld place",,,,,,,,,"Androutsopoulos, J., Participatory culture and metalinguistic discourse: performing and negotiating German dialects on YouTube (2013) Discourse 2.0: Language and New Media, pp. 47-71. , Georgetown University Press, Washington, DC, D.

Using Androutsopoulos[U+05F3]s (2014) framework for the empirical analysis of sharing online, the article examines practices of selecting, styling, and negotiating in significant moments of mourning online, focusing on the entextualizations of a female user shared over the course of a six-month period. The analysis shows how sharers mobilize discursive resources to construct their multifaceted identities as mourners in the local context of the memorial site as well as in the wider situational context of public mourning online. In addition, findings indicate how sharers use time and space deixis to construe spatiotemporal framings and position themselves interactionally and affectively to the dead, the networked mourners, and their digitally entextualized mutable self. It is argued that shifts from static to dynamic construals of time ('tonight' vs. 'everynight') and space ('up there' vs. 'everywhere') are linked to shifts from positions of relative disempowerment to positions of empowerment and agency for the sharer in the context of public mourning. The article offers insights relevant to the study of public mourning in relation to digital performances of self and it contributes to the empirical study of time and space deixis in discourse and participation online. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Affective positioning; Digital mourning; Entextualization; Mutable self; Sharing; Time and space deixis",,,,,,,,,"Androutsopoulos, J., (2010) Localizing the global on the participatory web, , Wiley-Blackwell, Malden, MA, N.

Conversations from four Ethiopian-Israeli male teens walking in a northern, peripheral Israeli city to and from pickup games (soccer/football, basketball) at public parks are analyzed. The data selected below all involve talk whilst using a social networking application called Tinder. Analyses follow a narrative practices approach (De Fina and Georgakopoulou, 2008, 2011), particularly that of small stories (Georgakopoulou, 2007). These teens are found to be world attending (a subtype of breaking-news stories) in voicing their noticings of the perceptible surroundings amidst pursuit of individual local interactional projects, i.e. a one-upmanship often exploitive of narrative practices of projections, i.e., unrealized possibilities, the irrealis. The introduction of mobile devices into conversational interactional space provides an added/resource of potential items (referents) to be attended to and thus creates a continued state of incipient multitasking across offline and online spaces. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Conversational interaction; Mobile devices; Multitasking; New mobilities; Social media; Spatialization",,,,,,,,,"Arminen, I., Intensification of time-space geography (2011) The Reconstruction of Space and Time: Mobile Communication Practices, 1, p. 89. , Transaction Publishers, New Jersey; Bamberg, M., Talk, small stories, and adolescent identities (2004) Human development, 47 (6), pp. 366-369; Bamberg, M., Georgakopoulou, A., Small stories as a new perspective in narrative and identity analysis (2008) Text & Talk-An Interdisciplinary Journal of Language, Discourse Communication Studies, 28 (3), pp. 377-396; Bruner, J., Life as narrative (1987) Soc.

From a perspective of linguistic ethnography we analyze exchanges where ethnicity is explicitly addressed in activities such as creating and maintaining friendship ties, teasing, flirting, etc. We show how ethnicity is brought about in media trends on Facebook, how it becomes associated with hip hop culture, how it is used in constructions of beauty and desirability, and how a societal discourse of ethnocentricity have consequences for patterns of identification, but also make up a resource in everyday interaction. We present data from one year of fieldwork among a group of pupils all attending the same school class with a special focus on two individuals and analyze three thematically interrelated key cases against the backdrop of the patterns we observe in the year-long data material. We show how our participants treat ethnicity as something to play around with, negotiate, transcend and create new versions of. At the same time though, we also find in our data instances in which our participants bring into play traditional ""old-school"" ethnicities and thereby mobilize fixed categories ideologically associated with authenticity as an actual aspect of ethnicization (Brubaker, 2004. Ethnicity without groups. Harvard University Press, Cambridge). In line with Otsuji and Pennycook (2010. Int. J. Multiling.7(3), 240-254) we therefore argue that fixed and fluid ethnicity categories are not brought into play as dichotomies but rather as symbiotically (re)constituting each other. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Authentication; Authenticity; Ethnicity; Ethnicization; Linguistic ethnography; Social media",,,,,,,,,"Agha, A., Voice, footing, enregisterment (2005) J.

Our empirical case is the Danish born performing artist Anita Lerche. Lerche sings in Punjabi, and in addition to language she deploys other semiotic elements which index India and Punjab. This triggers both negative and positive evaluations from her audience. In some cases, it even triggers (self) criticism of the deficient Punjabiness of Diaspora Punjabis. The overwhelming majority of the responses are based on an ideology of an inherent and natural relation between language and ethnic or geographical belonging. Lerche clearly does not conform to that as she explores her possibilities of identification and professional success beyond traditional borders and territories. The data analyzed consist of discussions on social media, and mainly responses to one of Lerche's Facebook posts. Despite the non-local character of the medium, and the different places of residence of the audience, a particular geographical location (Punjab) remains central in the construction of belonging, legitimacy, obligation and authenticity. In addition to data on Lerche's Facebook profile, we also draw on interviews with Lerche and some fieldwork. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Authenticity; Facebook; Legitimacy; Punjabi; Social media",,,,,,,,,"Arnaut, K., Super-diversity: elements of an emerging perspective (2012) Diversities, 14 (2), pp. 1-16; Ayres, A., Language, the nation and symbolic capital (2012) Punjab Reconsidered: History, Culture, and Practice, pp. 1-22. , Oxford University Press, Oxford, A.

Empirically, we aim to break new ground by investigating the intricate interconnections between two social media formats and combining two highly popular but previously seldom connected cultural forms-football and hip hop. Our theoretical aim is to contribute to the current debate on authenticity, normativity, popular culture and social media, and the complex ways in which they are connected. We focus, first, on the Twitter writing of the Finnish footballer Mikael Forssell, specifically his uses of non-Standard English and references to hip hop culture and rap music, and second, on the ways in which Forssell's stylized writing elicits normatively oriented metapragmatic commentaries, i.e., meta-level discussion, on a major Finnish football discussion forum. Of particular interest here is the emically emerging category of 'gangsta' English and its perceived (in)authenticity-when used by Forssell and two other ('White') middle-class Finnish footballers. Drawing on the frameworks of authenticity and sociolinguistic superdiversity, we foreground the tension between purist normativity and playful appropriation online. Our discussion highlights the unpredictability of the connections between language use, (popular) cultural forms, ethnicity, country of origin, and the complexity of mediation across online and offline sites of social action. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","African American Vernacular English; Authenticity; Football; Hip hop culture; Normativity; Social media",,,,,,,,,"Alaja, E., Forssell, M., (2007) Vielä yksi maali, , Teos, Helsinki; Androutsopoulos, J., Language choice and code-switching in German-based diasporic web forums (2007) The Multilingual Internet, pp. 340-361. , Oxford University Press, Oxford, B.

Box 3540014, Finland","Halonen, M., University of Jyväskylä, Center for Applied Language Studies, P.O. Box 3540014, Finland","In Finland, a social category called ""pissis girls"" has evolved into a cultural concept, used widely in various discourses concerning young women. In the paper, the empirical focus is on how, in the context of a viral video disseminated in social media, a group of young girls are presented as representatives of this category. The video, called ÄM IRK, is a short edited clip of an emergent interaction between young men and girls meeting by chance in a park. Drawing on the notions of membership categorisation, cluster of indexes and indexical field, ""enoughness"" and authentication, the paper investigates how the edited video, through the means of de- and recontextualisation of the emergent interaction evokes the category of the pissis girls in the ways in which it represents young adolescent girls.More specifically, the paper shows how the edited video uses selected emblems and activities that have been interpreted as key indices of the pissis category, such as the use of alcohol and the appearance and vanity of the girls, as semiotic material evocative ""enough"" to make the category of pissisness salient. Furthermore, in order to categorise someone as an authentic pissis girl, one has to show how the girls deviate from the ones who are not, that is, the ""ordinary"" or ""good"" or ""appropriate"" girls. And, in turn, when some emblems and activities are considered bound to the pissis girl category, the norms concerning girls in general become visible. In the video, the dynamics of categorisation, authentication, and normativity merge. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Categorisation; De- and recontextualisation; Enoughness; Indexes; Pissis girls",,,,,,,,,"Sanna, A., Tytöt ja maine.

It approaches dog blogs as an example of the strategic use of pervasive but contentious anthropomorphic western discourses about animals and discusses how dog bloggers use anthropomorphism as a discursive means for crafting and collectively ratifying authenticity in a translocal, interest-driven and informal social media context in which traditional territorial and demographic parameters of authenticity are not easily available or relevant.More specifically, the paper shows how the discursive means for authentication in dog blogging entail deliberate acts of ventriloquism and stylization. It analyses the ways in which these function to authenticate bloggers socially and morally as legitimate participants in dog blogging and as particular kinds of persons. Further, it discusses how a range of norms associated with blogging, on the one hand, and historically specific discourses about humans and companion animals, on the other hand, are recontextualized for the purposes of the socio-cultural niche in question. Particular attention is paid to how linguistic and discursive features associated with diary writing, as well as to how western discourses of dogs and animals are mobilized in the establishment, maintenance and regulation of the global practice about dogs in a way that is highly indexical of idealized, classed gender. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Anthropomorphism; Authentication; Blogging; Diary writing; Dogs; Stylization",,,,,,,,,"Arnaut, K., Super-diversity: elements of an emerging perspective (2012) Language and Superdiversities II Diversities, 14 (2), pp. 1-16; Bakhtin, M., Emerson, C., (1993) Problems of Dostoevsky[U+05F3]s Poetics, , University of Minnesota Press, Minneapolis; Blommaert, J., (2010) The Sociolinguistics of Globalization, , CUP, Cambridge; Blommaert, J., Slembrouck, S., Collins, J., Polycentricity and interactional regimes in 'global neighborhoods[U+05F3] (2005) Ethnography, 6, pp. 205-235; Blommaert, J., Varis, P., Enough is enough: the heuristics of authenticity in superdiversity (2013) Linguistic Superdiversity in Urban Areas: Research Approaches 2, pp. 143-160. , J.

In the paper I argue that written discourse have taken up a much more important role in people[U+05F3]s everyday discursive practices because of the widespread availability and impact of social media. As a consequence of this I make the claim that spoken and written discourse in combination should be considered when studying everyday language use and processes of enregisterment.In this article I illustrate how young people from a linguistically and culturally diverse area of Copenhagen use linguistic features indexical of speech styles in their linguistic practices on Facebook. I study how the use of such linguistic resources points towards different stereotypes and what sense of rights and sanctions are involved in the reactions to the use of these different types of marked language use. I study this to discuss how spoken language practices and practices associated with writing co-contribute to similar processes of enregisterment. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Enregisterment; Multi-sited ethnography; Normativity; Reflexivity; Social media; Youth",,,,,,,,,"Ag, A., (2010) Sprogbrug og Identitetsarbejde hos Senmoderne Storbypiger, p. 53. , Københavnerstudier i Tosprogethed, Københavns Universitet, Humanistisk Fakultet, København; Ag, A., Jørgensen, J.N., Ideologies, norms, and practices in youth poly - languaging (2013) Int.

I argue that the theoretical backdrop provided by the deconstruction of authenticity in sociolinguistics must be complemented by taking into account the specific conditions of social media as a site of communicative action that is central to contemporary mediatized societies. In the new public spheres constituted in social media, the display of authenticity is a core value in the production of discourse for a personal public. Displays of authenticity in social media are made available to a networked public whose follow-up discourses can involve remarkable linguistic reflexivity and normativity. Constructions and negotiations of authenticity in social media are found to draw on multilingual repertoires. Their objects of normative assessment are registers of language, which form part of an indexical order that can draw on globally circulating as well as locally anchored semiotic elements. Research in this area is likely to benefit from polycentric and transmedia strategies, which enable researchers to follow actors and their authenticating practices across on and offline spaces. © 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd.","Authenticity; Mediatization; Multilingualism; Online ethnography; Social media; Uptake",,,,,,,,,"Agha, A., (2007) Language and Social Relations, , Cambridge University Press, Cambridge; Androutsopoulos, J., (2008) Potentials and limitations of discourse-centred online ethnography, 5. , http://www.languageatinternet.org/articles/2008, Language@Internet.

Patients, as well, construct their identity and act as agents in various ways as they encounter the healthcare system and strive to manage their health conditions. This paper explores the notion of patient agency in healthcare settings and healthcare texts. The data comes from a health literacy project, commissioned by a New Zealand primary healthcare provider, and a Ph.D. project exploring the mediation and use of health information texts in a hospital setting. It draws on multiple data sources: text analyses on over 100 cardiovascular and diabetes information brochures, focus group interviews with cardiovascular and diabetes patients, and observations of patients' interactions with text in a hospital cardiovascular unit. These sources of data show ways that patient agency is represented and restricted and that identity is often constructed in conflict with patients' own conceptions of agency. The focus group interviews and hospital observations show how patients contest, accept, reject, and negotiate the identities constructed of them. As well, our data shows the contrast between patients' enacting agency and healthcare professionals' prescribed agency as compliance. Our sources of data confirm that knowledge of condition and care and associated agency are contingent on a constellation of affordances. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Agency; Health literacy; Patient identity",,,,,,"MHNRP10.01","The Health Literacy Project was funded by the Midlands Health Network (Grant MHNRP10.01 ) through a research project with the University of Waikato.

We approach the issue by first providing a brief historical account of content sharing practices from the early days of the Internet to the contemporary social media environment, in which content sharing is both prevalent and facilitated by platform architecture. We then conduct an exploratory quantitative content analysis of three Twitter hashtags relating to different topics, and link their structural variation to the different content sharing practices prevalent in them. We conclude by arguing that the social use of quotation in social media discourse can be a predictor of community structure, but that the degree to which this is the case differs locally. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Computer-mediated communication; Content sharing; Quoting; Retweeting; Social media; Twitter",,,,,,,,,"Abbott, B., Some notes on quotation (2003) Belg.

In order to account for the argument that a front cover may convey in support of that position, an argumentative reconstruction is required that also needs to take seriously into account the way in which the verbal and the visual modes interact to create meaning. The study proposes a multimodal argumentation perspective on the systematic reconstruction of the arguments that front covers of news magazines put forward. As a case in point, six covers by two German weekly news magazines are analysed, featuring the role of Greece in the eurozone crisis in the period 2010-2012. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Eurozone crisis; Front covers; Greece; Multimodal argumentation; News magazines; Strategic manoeuvring",,,,,,,,,"Bateman, J., (2008) Multimodality and Genre: A Foundation for the Systematic Analysis of Multimodal Documents, , Palgrave Macmillan, Basingstoke; Bateman, J., (2014) Text and Image.

Despite the fact that much online interaction meets the criteria for 'conversation', conversation analysis (CA) has only recently begun to grow and flourish as a methodology for analysing the overwhelming quantity of material that in many cases sits in archive form, visible to millions, on the Internet. We discuss the development of methods that are inherently suited for subjecting online interaction to the kind of rigorous analysis that conversation analysts have applied to talk of all kinds for several decades. We go on to explore the fundamental challenges that online data pose for CA, the value of many CA techniques for online analysis, and the possibilities of developing bespoke modes of analysis that are crafted for use with specific forms of online data (e.g. 'tweets' on Twitter). © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Computer-mediated communication; Conversation analysis; Digital media; Online discussion; Online interaction",,,,,,,,,"Antaki, C., Ardévol, E., Núnez, F., Vayreda, A., ""For she who knows who she is"": managing accountability in online forum messages (2005) J.

This assertion becomes especially salient for migrants, whose status is defined by a physical move from one place to another. The aim of this paper is to discuss the practice of place-making by migrants, with specific focus on the role of Facebook in this endeavour. We present the particular case of Amy, a Filipina immigrant to New Zealand, and her Facebook activities. Central to the discussion is a four-minute audio-visual piece that she produced herself and posted online to commemorate her family's second year as New Zealanders. Guided by the framework of multimodality, the concept of place, and the practice of everyday photography, and with invaluable insights from a semi-structured interview of the participant, we illustrate how semiotic resources afforded by social media sites such as Facebook foster the construction of the discourse of the good life and a claim to national belonging. Our analysis shows that everyday family photography, in interaction with social media, potentially signifies migrants' becoming a natural part of the national landscape. By interrogating the boundaries of private and public spaces, and reproducing the ""migrant gaze"" in everyday family photography, Amy transforms images into unified strands of the ideal immigrant narrative. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Facebook; Filipino diaspora; Migrant gaze; Migrant identity; Multimodality; Place-making",,,,,,"Auckland University of Technology, New Zealand, AUT: PBRF/56","The authors would like to express their appreciation to Amy, as participant in the study, likewise to her family, for their generosity in sharing personal details of their lives on Facebook.

G., National Research University Higher School of Economics, Moscow, Russian Federation","In modern Russia, official political discourse is routinely confronted by challenges from internet-based means of communication. Novel forms of political dialog have become widespread in new media, especially in terms of dialog initiated by ""ordinary"" people, who use irony and visual images to express their dissatisfaction with politicians' activities. This study suggests the characteristics of a special aspect of a computer-mediated political discourse in Russia. It demonstrates contextual and instrumental features of a visual political irony in new media based on a case study of the LiveJournal Internet community ""Potsreotizm"". An analysis of the instruments that members of this Internet community use to create visual irony leads to the conclusion that in the virtual space, myths and concepts created by the political elite are being constantly interpreted with the help of irony and humor, and people increasingly treat these myths and concepts critically at the level of daily social routine. Reflection, context and visual representation, which are necessary to create ironical discourse, offer original vocabularies for organizing public dialog within new media. Community members' worldviews are not preordained by the state but are shaped by cultural, social and cognitive processes in virtual forms of communication. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Internet community; New media; Russian political discourse; Visual irony",,,,,,,,,"Aday, S., al, all., Blogs and bullets: new media in contentious politics.

In this paper, we triangulate findings (incorporating data from surveys, focus groups, and tweets from activists, and combining qualitative and quantitative methods of analysis, chiefly through corpus-based critical discourse analysis) to gain a better understanding of how activists perceive and construct activism on SNS, to describe some features of successful and unsuccessful activist tweets, and to provide some recommendations for heightened impact of activist activities on SNS. To this aim, we describe to what extent certain actions leverage the affordances of digital media and distinguish between categories of action along two dimensions: individualistic vs. collectivistic and persuasive vs. confrontational. We find that activists describe goals that involve individualized, persuasive (and therefore low-risk) activities to be most effectively achieved using Twitter, likely due to fear of police intervention. Activist tweets are found to be retweeted at a dramatically lower rate than a reference corpus of general tweets, and are characterized by lack of original content. We conclude by discussing the various ways in which activists could improve these circumstances and optimize their engagement with SNS by radically increasing their leveraging of the affordances of digital media. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Activism; Corpus-based analysis; Discourse analysis; Success; Triangulation; Twitter",,,,,,"Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, EPSRC: EP/I033017/1

This innovative use, also known as impact captions, is now seen as a feature of Japanese (and other Asian) TV but has also spread into Western broadcasts (cf. the drama series Sherlock on BBC and the film Night Watch) in recent years. However, there is little research on the interpretive mechanism or viewer experience of such use and hence industries continue to use impact captions in an ad hoc manner. Working within Sperber and Wilson[U+05F3]s (1995) relevance theory, this paper is an attempt to explain the way viewers interpret the content of programmes with impact captions and the role these captions play in the interpretation process.

I analyze interactions in reunion episodes of The Real Housewives, a reality television series that since 2006 has followed casts of women in metropolitan locales around America, focusing on their affluent lifestyles. Reunion shows bring cast members together to discuss the previous season's episodes, providing space to talk about what happened and confront each other over unresolved issues. Because disclosure is normative in the reunion context, the casting of topics as ""taboo"" for discussion is interactionally salient and productive. My analysis shows that topic avoidance is triggered not by a set of categorically taboo topics, but rather by topics that momentarily threaten Housewives' enactment of culturally elite identities. Avoidance serves to protect their public images as both materially endowed-having status-and well-behaved-having class. I identify and illustrate three types of avoidance stance, which differ in the role alignments through which participants are positioned. These stances can function to limit the discussion of information threatening to one's own material status, to preserve one's own image as ""classy,"" and to introduce threatening information about another's status or class. Ultimately, avoidance stances are a way for Housewives to negotiate the tension between being on a reality television show, which requires openness and disclosure, and being evaluated as culturally elite, which requires behavioral restraint regarding talk about self and others. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Gender; Reality television; Social class; Stance; Taboo; Topic avoidance",,,,,,,,,"Allan, K., Burridge, K., (2006) Forbidden Words: Taboo and the Censoring of Language, , Cambridge University Press, Cambridge; Bucholtz, M., You da man: narrating the racial other in the production of white masculinity (1999) J.

Extending the genre analytic notion of rhetorical moves (Swales, 1981, 2004) to this computer-mediated text type, we analyzed 80 hotel replies that were posted in response to online consumer complaints. Our analysis of the responses of 4- and 5-star hotels located in 4 popular urban tourist destinations in China indicates that ten move types are commonly found in this genre, with eight of these appearing in the majority of reviews. These results suggest that online responses from businesses replying to user-generated reviews tend to be highly formulaic and conventionalized, with thanking and apologizing among the most common moves identified. However, we also found considerable variation with respect to how specific hotels were about addressing the problem(s) discussed in the original customer complaint, as well as the extent to which hotel management indicated having taken actions to correct those problems. Finally, our study found that in this set of responses, hotel personnel tended to emphasize a corporate (rather than personal) identity when constructing responses to complaints. The study's findings provide insights into some of the ways in which businesses are managing consumer dissatisfaction online. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Business CMC; Electronic word of mouth; Move analysis; Online complaints; Reputation management; TripAdvisor hotel reviews",,,,,,,,,"Anthony, L., (2011), http://www.antlab.sci.waseda.ac.jp/, AntConc (Version 3.2.2) [Computer Software].

This inquiry is situated in the context of two contemporary social phenomena: ambivalence toward class stratification in U.S. public discourse at a time of increasing class stratification, and a growth in the production and consumption of status-based reality television shows on U.S. broadcast and cable networks. For this study, a year of episodes from two programs were observed, one from network television set in the world of work, and one from cable television set in home life and leisure. Four cases selected from this corpus are analyzed multimodally to show how talk, images, and objects operate discursively to construct a dialog on class. Drawing from theories on the discursive construction of identity and agency, and focusing on members' methods of categorization and ventriloquism, we offer an understanding of class as enacted and engaged in - not just represented and talked about, but performed dialogically. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Class; Membership categorization; Multi-modal discourse analysis; Narrative; Reality television; Ventriloquism",,,,,,,,,"Atkinson, J.M., Heritage, J., Jefferson[U+05F3]s transcript notation (2006) The Discourse Reader, pp. 158-166. , Routledge, New York, A.

This is manifested sociolinguistically in a shift from Cantonese and traditional character script to Mandarin and simplified characters as default registers of Chinese. Young people of Chinese heritage critically respond to and (re-) position themselves against these changes. This paper explores their identity work and language identifications and adopts a view from digital media to this end. Such a view provides insight into the unstable and shifting conditions and contexts of being, speaking and learning Chinese in the diaspora.Theoretically the paper builds on a view of language as practice, translanguaging, repertoires and linguistic citizenship, and revisits Heinz Kloss' notion of ""ausbau"" as a concept in language policy and planning. Applied to both language and identity, the revisited notion of ausbau is meant to capture the tension between language/identity as an individual, biographic project involving personal investment and planning, and language/identity as a social, historical project sponsored by nations and states (such as the PRC). In the discussion threads that are presented and analysed, both of these poles provoke critical reflection and stancetaking: critique and resistance to the hegemonic power of the PRC's language ausbau, and self-critique in the form of self-depreciating evaluation of personally accomplished language ausbau.This contribution draws on a recently completed two-year ethnographic study in and around a Chinese complementary school in the Netherlands as part of a larger funded project investigating discourses of inheritance and identities in four multilingual European settings. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Ausbau; China; Globalisation; Language and identity; Netherlands; Translanguaging",,,,,,,,,"Androutsopoulos, J., English ""on top"": filling the space between anglicisms and English-only discourse (2012) Sociolinguist.

In media studies the term ""context collapse"" describes the process by which online social networks bring together people from various social contexts, thereby creating a diverse networked audience. In online social networks that involve participants from different countries and language communities, language choice becomes a pertinent issue. This paper draws on empirical data from social networks among young multilingual people on Facebook to examine strategies of language choice and negotiation. Drawing on the sociolinguistic framework of audience design, the sociolinguistics of multilingualism and computer-mediated discourse analysis, the analysis examines language choice in initiating and responding contributions, metapragmatic negotiations of language style and the role of English as a resource among networked writers. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Audience design; Context collapse; Language choice; Languaging; Multilingualism; Social networking sites",,,,,,,,,"Androutsopoulos, J., Networked multilingualism: some language practices on Facebook and their implications (2013) Int.

In doing so, I examine how Nepalis in the diaspora employ YouTube as a discursive site to express their collective identity by responding to the video of speech delivered in 'bad' English by Nepal[U+05F3]s minister for health at a UN meeting. Focusing on ideologies of English in the context of Nepal, I discuss three key themes that emerged in the video texts and comments: language ideologies in the entextualization of the videos, language ideologies and discourses of prestige and disgrace, and the relationship of language ideologies with political ideologies. Overall, the analysis shows that YouTube brings superdiverse participants together with their multiple subjectivities, identities and attitudes, and their demonstrated language competence is characterized by varied forms of linguistic repertoires in English and in Nepali. Ideologically, the comments seem to reproduce the modernist view of language as a bounded system, but linguistic resources used to construct these comments show a number of linguistic peculiarities and heteroglossic uses that challenge the writers' own conscious conceptualization of language. Finally, the study provides insights for understanding the role of transnational digital media for a sociolinguistics of superdiversity. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Language ideology; Nepal; Superdiversity; Transnationalism; YouTube",,,,,,,,,"Androutsopoulos, J., Localizing the global on the participatory web (2010) Handbook of Language and Globalization, pp. 203-231. , Blackwell, Oxford, N.

Luxembourg has a historically trilingual language situation incorporating Luxembourgish, French and German. In addition to this, the growth of the financial sector has increased the presence of English as a lingua franca. In addition to changing migration patterns, new online phenomena also influence language and communication practices in Luxembourg. This paper analyses digital communication practices related to superdiversity in a Facebook group associated with Luxembourg. Although the main purpose of this group is to facilitate the gifting of consumer goods, it has the side-effect of promoting intercultural and multilingual contact among diverse residents of Luxembourg. The paper focuses on how communication is organised between the diverse members of the group, based on a quantitative and qualitative analysis of language practices over the first eighteen months of the group's existence. The analysis illustrates how language became an issue with the growth of the group, shows how members' language practices changed over time, and highlights the role of the group administrators, who intervened to regulate incidents within the group and facilitate group communication. The paper also considers how technical features of this particular digital environment impact on communication practices within the group. The results of the analysis show that language practices of group members tend inexorably towards homogenisation rather than diversification, putting into question the relationship between a superdiverse context and superdiverse communicative practices. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Facebook group; Group administration; Language policies; Language practices; Luxembourg; Superdiversity",,,,,,,,,"Androutsopoulos, J., Networked multilingualism: some language practices of Facebook and their implications.

This paper joins the conversation on digital language and superdiversity by examining this interactive web forum that caters largely to the Senegalese diaspora. While there are intimations of superdiversity that break through in a number of ways within the forum, participants by and large limit themselves to the use of two predictable languages, French, Senegal[U+05F3]s official language, and Wolof, its dominant language. In attempting to reconstruct home virtually through their participation in this community of practice, Seneweb writers circumscribe their more diverse repertoires to mirror the shared aspects of their individual repertoires and the linguistic environment that they have left behind. The data are taken from readers' reactions to a story concerning internationally famous singer Youssou N'Dour[U+05F3]s announcement of his candidacy for the presidency of Senegal in the highly contested 2012 elections. The comments, which are written primarily in French and urban Wolof, reveal opposing language ideologies that reflect deep-seated beliefs about the nature of the francophone state. These are played out through critiques and praise of N'Dour, and specifically what is perceived as his inadequate knowledge of French, the official language. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","French; Language ideology; Multilingualism; Senegal; Superdiversity; Wolof",,,,,,,,,"Androutsopoulos, J., Multilingualism, diaspora, and the internet: codes and identities on German-based diaspora websites (2006) J.

As a consequence, such racialized discourse provides ideal material for a sociolinguistic analysis of CMC. Based on these assumptions, this study focuses on how race and ethnicity are performed on the web forum Nairaland, a digital community and place of interaction for Nigerian locals, first- and secondgeneration Nigerian emigrants, as well as participants with other ethnic backgrounds. A large-scale corpus (17 million token, time span of 4 years) was analyzed in terms of racial and ethnic identity construction of the community members; in particular, the use of Nigerian Pidgin as an ethnolinguistic repertoire within the community was taken into account. The analysis includes visualizations of the globalized community structure, a quantitative assessment of the distribution of racial and ethnic labels, and a qualitative close reading of diasporic narratives of belonging. The results of this study illustrate how the use and (often conscious) selection of ethnolinguistic repertoires contribute to the complex and varied racial/ethnical identities on display in the forum data. In this sense, this paper makes a contribution to our understanding of the sociolinguistic implications of super-diversity, and the essential role that digital mediation plays in its emergence. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Computer-mediated communication; Epithets; Ethnicity; Narratives of belonging; Race; Sociolinguistics of globalization",,,,,,"Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG: MA 1652/9

The focal points of our analysis are: how young adolescents relocalize manga in digital media, the multilingual repertoires these adolescents use in the relocalization of manga, and the manner in which the relocalization of manga and the multilingual repertoires in digital media contribute to indexing the identity of these adolescents.The results show that digital media opens up for and encourages dialogue through which the identity performances of young adolescents are invigorated. Through their repertoires, the adolescents perform local, global and glocal identities that reflect superdiverse conditions. The participants' choice of, e.g., Japanese screen names highlights their indexing of identities in which local and global aspects are blended and where Japanese aspects are highlighted, whereas other heritage cultures are backgrounded. From the adolescents' engagement in a global and transnational manga culture, we learn that, in superdiverse conditions, global transcultural flows can affect the lives of adolescents to the extent that these become a central part of their identity performance.In the article, we propose a sociolinguistic online ethnography approach in which we combine (socio)linguistic ethnography with online ethnography. The study shows how the ethnographic data supports, deepens and nuances the analysis. Sociolinguistic online ethnography thus offers a lens through which we as researchers can access not only multilingual repertoires per se but also the participants' voices and interpretations. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Digital media; Identities; Linguistic repertoires; Manga; Multilingual literacies; Relocalization",,,,,,,"In memory of Professor Jens Normann Jørgensen, who encouraged us to pursue these aspects of our research.

Methodologically it tries to respond to a call, by several authors, for more empirically grounded research as a means of addressing the complexities involved in contemporary national-transnational dialogs and identity construction processes. The analysis, while resting on a larger cultural and postcolonial studies' frame of reference, brings this kind of translocal conversation home with an in-depth analysis of digital encounters detected in text trajectories on blogs and social media. The data, approached through the lenses of competing orders of indexicality, indicate that ""cultural identity"" (as enacted through the exchanges of a handful of Portuguese and Brazilian nationals) is a minefield that has to be understood as interlacing discrepant indexical values: it simultaneously articulates historic rivalries and their rejection. From this point of view, the voices of several of the focused interlocutors seemed to cry out for new meaning-making processes while still orienting to Colonial totalizing dichotomies and hierarchies. This kind of dovetailing adds more nuanced contours to the notion of superdiversity being explored in this special volume, reconstructing it in terms of a permanent and necessary diversity-sameness dialectics - a kind of friction that has been exacerbated in digital contexts. Put otherwise, ""colonial empires"" are still around as orienting references but, in superdiverse times, not only do they write back but also blog back in multi-territorial discursive trajectories. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Cultural identities; Digital text trajectories; Gendered othering processes; Orders of indexicality; Superdiversity",,,,,,,,,"Agha, A., (2007) Language and Social Relations, , Cambridge University Press, Cambridge; Anderson, B., (1983) Imagined Communities: Reflections on the Origin and Spread of Nationalism, , Verso, London; Ashcroft, B., Griffiths, G., Tiffin, H., (1989) The Empire Writes Back: Theory and Practice in Post-Colonial Literature, , Routledge, London/2002; Bauman, Z., (1992) Intimations of Postmodernity, , Routledge, London; Blommaert, J., (2005) Discourse, , Cambridge University Press, Cambridge; Blommaert, J., (2010) The sociolinguistics of globalization, , Cambridge University Press, Cambridge; Blommaert, J., Rampton, B., Language and Superdiversity: A Position Paper (2011), http://www.kcl.ac.uk/ldc, Working Papers in Urban Language & Literacies,≠70.

I find that the adolescents engagement with the Illuminati society is not limited to new media practices but on the contrary spread to other everyday practices as well. In examining how the adolescents relate to and use such transcultural flows I look at how they align and dis-align with Illuminati imagery and how they engage with the conspiracy theory in different everyday situations and on Facebook. In this way I discuss how Illuminati imagery is used as a resource in the young people's everyday social practices. Such insights clarify the way in which transcultural phenomena that are circulated by the Internet and new media become elements of cultural diversity in so-called ""super-diverse"" societies. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Computer-mediated communication; Illuminati; Popular culture; Sociolinguistics; Super-diversity; Transcultural flows",,,,,,,,,"Androutsopoulos, J., Potentials and limitations of discourse-centred online ethnography (2008) Language@internet, 5 (8). , http://www.languageatinternet.org/articles/2008/1610, Avaliable at:; Aupers, S., ""Trust no one"": modernization, paranoia and conspiracy culture (2012) Eur.

In this article, I argue that the use of 'superdiverse' as a descriptive adjective is a theoretical cul-de-sac, because the complexities brought about by diversity in the social world ultimately defy numerical measurement (as it would require infinitely more fine-grained categories of difference). Consequently, superdiversity is best used as a conceptual device, that is, as a theoretical perspective on language and social life (e.g. Blommaert and Rampton 2011). As a conceptual tool, rather than an empirical fact, superdiversity is part of a broader concern in contemporary sociolinguistics to develop a new theoretical vocabulary. The articles collected in this special issue respond to this call and illustrate the diversities of digital engagement. However, while superdiversity directs our attention towards complexity and unpredicability, the papers collected also draw attention to a counter-movement: a persistent desire for normativity and predictability. In the final section of the article, I suggest that it would be fruitful to bring together on-going work on superdiversity with equally on-going work on creativity, as both share a focus on the unexpected and creative uses of language. Both thus provide a counter-narrative to the desire for normativity and predictability, and allow us to develop a theoretical perspective which moves beyond statistical patterns and conventions, and recognizes language as a fundamentally open system. © 2014.","Creativity; Normativity; Sociolinguistic theory; Superdiversity",,,,,,,,,"Anderson, G.D.S., Language hotspots: what (applied) linguistics and education should do about language endangerment in the twenty-first century (2011) Lang.

Bonds consist of couplings of interpersonal and ideational meaning that are revealed by an appraisal analysis of the letters, and show how the identity of the readership community is co-constructed by the letter writers. Ideational meaning is identified by generating frequency and keyword lists with a concordancer. The appraisal information provides an empirical base from which to compare the natures of the two newspapers' readership communities in terms of how they view agency and group cohesion. This is done to explore whether the communities of readership are as different as they are perceived to be (by those who reject tabloids). Main findings show how both communities affiliate around the value of education, but The Times' readers are more individualistic than the Daily Sun's, who concentrate primarily on the behaviour of the group. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Affiliation; Appraisal; Bonding; Corpus linguistics; Imagined community; Newspaper",,,,,,,,,"Anderson, B., (1983) Imagined Communities: Reflections on the Origin and Spread of Nationalism, , Thetford Press Limited, Norfolk; Baker, P., (2006) Using Corpora in Discourse Analysis, , Continuum, London, New York; Bakhtin, M.M., (1981) The Dialogic Imagination: Four Essays, , University of Texas Press, Austin, M.M.

Through a theoretical discussion of the 'Twitter Joke Trial', we highlight the growing importance of understanding 'individual communicative nuance' (ICN) and complex power relations in the production and interpretation of online texts. But ICN is not the only problematic practice of online communications; there are other social and environmental factors that impact upon the production, consumption and interpretation of social media. Whilst adopting previous understandings of discourse, context and social practice we refine and apply models of panoptic and synoptic power that are applicable to the communicative complexities of the social media. These dimensions of power, we argue, are unfixed and shift according to the contextual environments in which they are produced and consumed. Hence, we show that critical discourse studies (CDS) can incorporate theoretical frameworks that provide the investigative and analytical approaches necessary for exploring power relations in digital media technologies. By developing this theoretical approach we propose the concept of synoptic resistance, which mobilizes oppositional power against authoritative surveillance. Whilst we do not deny that broader social structures maintain top-down power, we argue that 'omnioptic' media environments complicate these power relations in the 'countercurrents' they provide against authority. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Context; Discourse; Power; Social media; Surveillance; Twitter",,,,,,,,,"Androutsopoulos, J., Potentials and Limitations of Discourse-centred Online Ethnography.

Drawing upon style (Coupland, 2007a. Style: Language Variation and Identity. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.) and the General Theory of Verbal Humour (Attardo, 1994. Linguistic Theories of Humour. Berlin and New York: Mouton de Gruyter; Attardo, 2001. Humorous Texts: A Semantic and Pragmatic Analysis. Berlin and New York: Mouton de Gruyter.) we analyse fictionalised media constructions of clashes and dissonances between 'standard' and 'vernacular' styles in a popular sitcom and in an advertisement. We argue that the representation of the speech of the characters under scrutiny results in stylistic humour, as the protagonists are stylised either as unable to make 'obligatory' crossings and stand up to the requirements of a formal context, or as unwilling to restrict themselves to varieties that are stereotypically associated with their social and geographical backgrounds. Our protagonists are deprecated for opting for flexible code alternation and for their attempt to recontextualise linguistic varieties. So, the stylisation of the TV characters and the humorous framing of linguistic varieties seem to promote discourses of linguistic homogeneity and language differentiation. We therefore argue that normalised language ideologies are reproduced in the Greek context, despite the recent development of superdiversity in the Western sociolinguistic world promoting a more flexible approach to language varieties and affording ever evolving language ideologies. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Greek mass culture texts; Language ideologies; Linguistic varieties; Style; Stylistic humour",,,,,,"Ministry of National Education and Religious Affairs: MIS 375599

This morphological-orthographic feature is analyzed from a linguistic and distributional standpoint in a 12.5 million word corpus of German hip hop discussion, revealing its patterns of use over a decade in both contexts within this community, along with supplemental examples from YouTube videos. This corpus analysis is paired with a case study of a discourse event between two forum participants negotiating the use of this form, revealing a surprising streak of linguistic conservatism in the German hip hop community as well as the contested nature of the form's usage. The results of this study demonstrate the need for closer attention to morphological forms in sociolinguistic studies of computer-mediated communication, as such forms can reveal linguistic behavior that would not be evident in spoken language, but which are nevertheless contested and negotiated as linguistic features. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Computer-mediated communication; German; Hip hop; Language contact; Linguistic borrowing; Orthography",,,,,,,,,"Androutsopoulos, J., Non-standard spellings in media texts: the case of German fanzines (2000) J.

Overall, the two populations display homogeneity across the engagement resources of monogloss and heterogloss, construing hotel review writing as primarily assertive and drastically constricted against alternative voices. The two populations' homogeneous engagement pattern suggests that their hotel review writing is not determined by their respective national cultures. Rather it has to do with the factors of introspectiveness, impersonality and asynchrony, and beneficial mutualism concerning travelers, potential travelers, hotel owners/managements, and travel websites.

Cramer's persona and interactions adhere to a hegemonic masculinity dominant in American culture, and they create a sphere in which it is the only normative identity possible. This hegemonic masculinity is created by the use of specific phrases (e.g. the ""booyah"" salutation), actions (e.g. compliments to the host), by the insertion of sports as a topic of discussion, and by Cramer's dominant positioning as an expert. After presenting these features we demonstrate how this arena creates problems for the very few female callers participating in it. We therefore conclude that the ""Lightening Round"" helps to construct and reproduce masculinist authority in this mass-mediated window into the world of finance. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Conversation analysis; Finances; Gender; Media; Phone-ins; Sports",,,,,,"University of Massachusetts, UMASS","A previous version was presented at the NCA 97th annual convention, New Orleans, LO, USA, 2011.

However, little attention has focused on how these programs are presented in media discourse. This study aims to fill this gap by examining media discourse and how DLE is currently relayed to the public. Twenty-nine online articles from US news sources were collected and analyzed as regards linguistic strategies used in media discourse of DLE. Findings reveal the prevailing metaphors used in multilingual/monolingual discourse to be LANGUAGE/ENGLISH AS WATER and DLE AS BUSINESS/FACTORY. Other significant findings include the frequent use of linguistic strategies such as metonymy, pre-suppositions, legitimization and deictics. Based on these findings, the authors offer suggestions of how discourse can be adapted to expand and improve communication about DLE in future media discourse.© 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Critical linguistic analysis; Dual language education; Media discourse",,,,,,,,,"Block, D., Gray, J., Holborow, M., (2012) Neoliberalism and Applied Linguistics, , Routledge, London; Capetillo-Ponce, P., Challenges to multiculturalism (2002) New England Journal of Public Policy, 20, pp. 139-147; Center for Applied Linguistics (2012), http://www.cal.org/twi/directory/, Directory of two-way immersion programs in the U.S. Retrieved from; Collier, V., Thomas, W.P., The astounding effectiveness of DLE for all (2004) NABE Journal of Research and Practice, 2 (1), pp. 1-20; Dedaić, M., Dale, K., Mediated collaborative positioning: the case of prisoner blogs (2012) Discourse, Context and Media, 1, pp. 20-31; de Jong, E.J., Policy discourses and U.S. language in education policies (2013) Peabody Journal of Education, 88 (1), pp. 98-111; Fairclough, N., (2000) New Labour, New Language?, , Routledge, London and New York; Fauconnier, G., Methods and generalizations (1999) Cognitive Linguistics: Foundations, Scope and Methodology, pp. 95-128. , Mouton De Gruyter, Berlin, T.

Inclusion in these programmes demonstrated political progress for the BNP, yet ironically facilitated breadth of criticism for the party, as his appearances were met with widespread hostility and accusations of extremism. Reactive rhetoric to these criticisms is central to Griffin rebranding the party and becoming part of mainstream UK politics. Discourse analysis is used to explore how Griffin responds to such criticism during two radio programmes and one television programme between 2009 and 2010. The analysis shows how Griffin uses two interconnected strategies of (1) presenting British people as the victims, rather than the perpetrators, of racism, and (2) blaming this racism not on outside groups, but on an ill-defined 'ruling elite'. These strategies are not independent of one another and function in response to criticism to present Griffin and the BNP as not racist aggressors but respondents to anti-white racism. The implications of this strategy for the presentation and attempted rebranding of the BNP, alongside other far right and mainstream parties, are discussed. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","British National Party; Discourse analysis; Far-right; Racism; Racism denial",,,,,,,,,"Antaki, C., Leudar, I., Recruiting the record: using opponents' exact words in parliamentary argumentation (2001) Text, 21 (4), pp. 467-488; Atton, C., Far-right media on the internet: culture, discourse and power (2006) New Media Society, 8 (4), pp. 573-587; Augoustinos, M., Every, D., The language of ""race"" and prejudice: a discourse of denial, reason, and liberal-practical politics (2007) Journal of Language and Social Psychology, 26, pp. 123-141; Billig, M., Humour and hatred: the racist jokes of the Ku Klux Klan (2012) Discourse and Society, 12 (3), pp. 267-289; Billig, M., The notion of 'prejudice': some rhetorical and ideological aspects (1988) Text, 8 (1-2), pp. 91-110; Billig, M., (1978) Fascists: A Social Psychological View of the National Front, , Academic Press, London; Clarke, V., Kitzinger, J., Potter, J., ""Kids are just cruel anyway"": lesbian and gay parents' talk about homophobic bullying (2004) British Journal of Social Psychology, 43 (4), pp. 531-550; Clayman, S., Heritage, J., (2002) The News Interview: Journalists and Public Figures on the Air, , Cambridge University Press, Cambridge; Condor, S., Temporality and collectivity: diversity, history and the rhetorical construction of national entitativity (2006) British Journal of Social Psychology, 45, pp. 657-682; Condor, S., Pride and prejudice: identity management in English people's talk about 'this country' (2000) Discourse and Society, 11, pp. 175-205; Copsey, N., Changing course or changing clothes?

The results show that, as in other CMC practices, emoticons are mostly used as sentence closure devices in the collected data (about 63%), indicating that writers of Keitai-mail naturally use the end of the sentence as a place to add extra-textual messages such as feelings or implications. Moreover, some standard scripts such as periods ('[U+3002]') are also used as emotional markers in addition to their formal usage as simple sentence closing devices. These texting practices can be interpreted as showing that the sentence closing is the most important method since the messages intended to be expressed in Keitai-mail have become more sensitive in terms of reflecting a subtle meaning or implication through this method. The choice of whether to use standard or picture-based symbols contributes to this practice as well. © 2013 .","Computer mediated communication (CMC); Emoticons; Keitai-mail; Mobile phone e-mail; Non-textual elements",,,,,,,"I would like to extend my thanks to Emeritus Professor Nanette Gottlieb, the University of Queensland, for proofreading on this article as well as her advice to a whole project of language and communication practices via Japanese mobile phone mail.

This article explores how domestic abuse of foreign labour may be legitimised through public discourses. It analyses examples from the press of court cases involving FDHs, and compares the media's version of events with the domestic worker's story as it was recorded at a church shelter for abused migrant women. The analyses show that the press engages in positive us-presentation and negative them-presentation. Employers' crimes against FDHs are consistently mitigated and explained, whereas FDHs' offences against their employers are characterised as evil actions committed by 'aliens' with a flawed character. The article argues that FDHs are dehumanised in the press which contributes to their moral exclusion. Thus, a culture of indifference has developed where public and private discourses construct FDHs as non-entities, expendable and undeserving, and therefore, exploiting them is widely seen as acceptable and just. •The Hong Kong press engages in positive us-presentation and negative them-presentation.•Foreign domestic helpers are portrayed as 'aliens' with 'strange' beliefs.•Local employers' crimes against foreign domestic helpers are mitigated.•Foreign domestic helpers are demonised in the press.•Media narratives about foreign domestic helpers legitimise their dehumanistation. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Critical discourse analysis; Elite racism; Foreign domestic helpers; Media language; Moral exclusion",,,,,,,"The research reported in this article was supported by a General Research Grant from the University Grants Committee of Hong Kong [Grant no.

The aim of this paper is to assess the current state of non-verbal cue research in computer-mediated discourse and demonstrate the need for a more comprehensive and methodologically rigorous exploration of written non-verbal signalling. The study proposes a contextual and usage-centered view of written paralanguage. Through illustrative, close linguistic analyses the study proves that previous approaches to non-standard spelling based on their relation to the spoken word might not account for the complexities of this CMC cue, and in order to further our understanding of their interactional functions it is more fruitful to describe the role they play during the contextualisation of the verbal messages. The interactional sociolinguistic approach taken in the analysis demonstrates the range of interactional functions letter repetition can achieve, including contribution to the inscription of socio-emotional information into writing, to the evoking of auditory cues or to a display of informality through using a relaxed writing style. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Computer-mediated communication; Computer-mediated discourse; Contextualisation; Instant messaging; Non-verbal; Paralanguage",,,,,,,,,"Al-Sa'di, R.A., Hamdan, J.M., ""Synchronous online chat"" English: computer-mediated communication (2005) World Englishes, 24 (4), pp. 409-424; Ameka, F., Interjections: the universal yet neglected part of speech (1992) Journal of Pragmatics, 18 (2-3), pp. 101-118; Androutsopoulos, J., Non-standard spellings in media texts: the case of German fanzines (2000) Journal of Sociolinguistics, 4 (4), pp. 514-533; (1984), Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, M.J.

It analyzes how the media, by means of various discursive strategies, legitimize or delegitimize different stakeholder claims about how to handle environmental issues, i.e. how certain definitions of how to understand and manage them achieve hegemonic positions. Guided by critical discourse analysis, the paper analyzes local and national newspapers' reporting on two insect outbreaks in Sweden: one which resulted in spraying and one which did not. The analysis focuses on the constructions of causes and solutions to the problems and of the consequences of spraying. The paper concludes that the news media's contribution to the production of hegemonic meaning on contested environmental issues is heavily colored by the routines of journalism, as well as by media logic in general and the media's difficulties handling scientific uncertainty in particular. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Biodiversity; Critical discourse analysis; Environmental sociology; Journalistic routines; Media logic; News media",,,,,,"Svenska ForskningsrÃ¥det Formas","Both authors contributed equally to this work.

The nature of the blog and its technological affordances affect the interaction taking place and the strategies used by the participants in the blog to negotiate interpersonal relations. The purpose of this paper is to examine conflict in academic blog discussions (i.e. discussions in the comments sections), to analyze whether the medium features of weblog discourse influence the strategies used to construe conflict and to determine how conflict is used for the construction of online identity. The data for the study consisted in discussions taken from 9 academic weblogs. I analyzed the corpus to get data on the following aspects: (i) the frequency of conflictual acts in each academic weblog; (ii) the strategies used to construe conflict; (iii) the target of the conflictual act. The analysis revealed a high incidence of conflictual acts in academic blog discussions, ranging from mild criticism and disagreement to more severe expressions of conflict, like bold criticism, challenging questions or insults. These results can be related to the participants' desire to construct their online identity by using conflict to defend their values and beliefs and show their allegiance to a particular group. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Academic blogs; CMC; Conflict; Identity; Impoliteness; Interpersonal communication",,,,,,,,,"Angouri, J., Tseliga, T., ""You have no idea what you are talking about!""

The authors use Critical Discourse Analysis (CDA) to examine the global controversy that erupted in response to the single episode in which the show's hosts invoked demeaning stereotypes of Mexico. Martin and White's appraisal framework was applied to a series of texts taken from this global discourse in order to identify the textual means by which humor-in the episode itself as well as the emotionally-charged discourse that emanates from it-serves to reinforce nationalist ideology as the prevailing commonsense. Drawing on multiple fields, this CDA exploration draws a conceptual bridge to the established work on racialized humor in that both benefit from controversial episodes that are played out in mass media because people take the central ideological premise as a given in order to participate in the discourse, thus perpetuating the ideology's central positioning as an unchallenged commonsense. It is worthwhile to study the relationship between nationalized humor and the mass media because it serves as a valuable complement to the existing literature on racialized humor, and it also contributes to broader questions about the role of mass media in reinforcing ideologies. 1.We apply Critical Discourse Analysis to a controversial television episode of Top Gear.2.The analysis delineates the interplay between humor, nationalism, and racism in mass media.3.Ideologies of race and nation are reproduced when race and nation are presupposed in discourse.4.We draw a conceptual bridge between racialized humor and nationalized humor with this study. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Appraisal framework; BBC; Critical Discourse Analysis; Humor; Nationalism; Racism",,,,,,,,,"Agha, A., Commodity registers (2011) Journal of Linguistic Anthropology, 21 (1), pp. 22-53; Anderson, B., (2006) Imagined Communities: Reflections on the Origins and Spread of Nationalism, revised edition, , Verso, London; Baker, P., Potts, A., Why do white people have thin lips?: Google and the perpetuation of stereotypes via auto-complete search forms (2013) Critical Discourse Studies 10, pp. 1-18; Bakhtin, M., (1981) The Dialogic Imagination [Trans.

Drawing on genre theory and corpus-based discourse analysis, I detail the rhetorical patterns that exist in these reviews by analyzing a corpus of 142 ""most helpful positive"" and ""most helpful critical"" product reviews. A comparison of the results indicates that differences exist in the rhetorical patterning of positive and critical reviews. To reconcile this difference, I put forward a general argument that these differences still work towards the same overall communicative purpose of the genre, which is in turn a reflection of the shared values and goals of the Amazon.com discourse community. Product reviews that contain new or ""experience"" type information, as opposed to old or ""search"" (Mudambi and Schuff, 2010) type information are preferred by the Amazon.com discourse community. Concurrently, reviews that are similar to the ""soft selling"" form of advertisements (Cook, 1992), or reviews that are reminiscent of elements of ""synthetic personalization"" (Fairclough, 1989), are considered less helpful than reviews that focus on the author or product of the review. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Amazon.com; Evaluation; Genre analysis; Online product reviews; Personal experience",,,,,,,,,"Bhatia, V.K., (1993) Analyzing Genre: Language Use in Professional Settings, , Longman, London; Bhatia, V., Applied genre analysis: a multi-perspective model (2002) IBERICA, 4, pp. 3-19; Bhatia, V.K., (2004) Worlds of Written Discourse: A Genre-Based View, , Continuum, London; Cook, G., (1992) The Discourse of Advertising, , Routledge, New York, NY; (1989) Language and Power, , Pearson, New York, NY Fairclough; Fortanet, I., The emergence of a new genre: advertising on the Internet (Netvertising) (1999) Hermes, 23, pp. 93-113; Gee, J.P., Literacy, discourse, and linguistics: introduction and what is literacy?

However, WDA studies have seldom touched on how colleagues talk after work and outside the workplace; nor have these studies questioned whether the CofP framework can conceptualize such an emergent form of workplace talk. Drawing on empirical data collected from one Hong Kong branch of an Italian restaurant, this study aims to (1) explore how its employees communicate workplace issues and negotiate power in Facebook Status Updates after work and (2) examine use of the CofP framework in their talk which takes place outside the workplace. Adopting methods of discourse analysis, we find that colleagues individualize their talk in Status Updates for highlighting professionality, suggesting administrative changes, managing colleague relationships, and releasing work-oriented tension. In these processes involving Netspeak, institutional authority, official hierarchy and predetermined status are largely fluctuating or collapsing. Simultaneously, there are often ambiguity or invisibility in relation to the indispensable substances in a CofP, namely the strength of joint enterprises, form of mutual engagements and use of shared repertoire. We conclude by arguing that (1) Status Updates can be strategically used after work, usually in a more casual and personal manner, to attain workplace-oriented goals and re/negotiate power among colleagues, and that (2) it remains questionable whether the online workplace talk by a group of colleagues after work can be appropriately conceptualized by the existing use of CofP framework in WDA. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Communities of Practice; Discourse; Facebook; Power; Status Updates; Workplace",,,,,,,,,"Baron, N.S., Instant messaging and the future of language (2005) Communications of the ACM, 48 (7), pp. 29-31; Bolander, B., Locher, M.A., Constructing identity on Facebook: report on a pilot study (2010) Performing the Self, pp. 165-185. , K.

These reviews can be written by professional critics or by other consumers. However, little is known on the issue how the texts written by these two groups of reviewers differ. To answer this question, we conducted a genre analysis of online film reviews by analyzing and comparing the moves and strategies in online film reviews written by professional and consumer critics. Both quantitative and qualitative analyses show that these two groups of texts differ: Consumer critics mainly evaluate the movies and mostly write from a personal perspective. In contrast, reviews written by professional critics describe the movie instead of evaluating it. These results show that online reviews written by professional and consumer critics differ in terms of content which may have important implications for discourse on the Internet. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Consumer criticism; Genre analysis; Online reviews; Professional criticism; Word of mouth",,,,,,,,,"Basuroy, S., Chatterjee, S., Ravi, S.A., How critical are critical reviews?

In general, TV talk shows aim at entertaining the audience by interviewing celebrities either about their work or their personal life, subjects that will interest the audience. Since air time is limited, silence in such TV talk shows is not preferred. However, our study shows that there are many instances of silences in these talk shows. Silences are seen as meaningful turns in the conversations. The data is taken from two Chinese TV talk shows: Lu Yu You Yue (A Date with Lu Yu, henceforth LY) which is a popular information talk show in China and Kang Xi Lai Le (Here Comes Kang Xi, henceforth KX) from Taiwan. This study explores how the frame or expectations of the type of a talk show will determine how the silences are used in relation to face-work given the media specificity and cultural expectations. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Chinese; Face-work; Frame; Politeness; Silence; Talk shows",,,,,,,,,"Agyekum, K., The communicative role of silence in Akan (2002) Pragmatics, 12 (1), pp. 31-51; Anderson, P.A., (2008) Nonverbal Communications: Forms and Functions, , Waveland Press, Inc., Illinois; Axtell, R.E., (1991) Gestures: the Do's and Taboos of Body Language Around the World, , John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York; Brown, P., Levinson, S.C., (1987) Politeness: Some Universals in Language Use, , Cambridge University Press, Cambridge; Bull, P.E., (1987) Posture and Gesture, , Pergamon Press, Oxford; Burgoon, J.K., Buller, D.V., Johndall, W.G., (1996) Nonverbal Communication: The Unspoken Dialogue, , McGraw-Hill, New York; Carbough, D., (1988) Talking American: Cultural Discourses on Donahue, , Ablex, NorJohnd NJ; Clayman, S., Reformulating the question: a device for answering/not answering questions in news interviews and press conferences (1993) Text, 13, pp. 19-88; Cotterill, J., 'You do not have to say anything': instructing the jury on the defendant's right to silence in the English criminal justice system (2005) Multilingua, 24, pp. 7-24; Culpeper, J., Impoliteness and entertainment in the television quiz show: the weakest link (2005) Journal of Politeness Research, 1, pp. 35-72; Du Bois, J.W., Schuetze-Coburn, S., Cumming, S., Paolino, D., Outline of discourse transcription (1993) Talking Data: Transcription and Coding in Discourse Research, pp. 45-89. , Erlbaum, Hillsdale, NJ, J.A.

One issue for readers of an argument may be unfamiliarity with its topic. If this is the case, they may be unaware of the 'other side' of the argument. In the strategy that I put forward, the reader finds this out, gaining knowledge of key concerns across related groups which oppose the stance of the argument. This is achieved through corpus linguistic analysis of collections of texts from opposition websites. The results of these analyses allow the reader to judge the extent to which the argument addresses common oppositional concerns. As I show, this not only affords critical perspective on the argument but potentially problematising of it relative to these concerns. To assist me in developing this approach, I engage with some key ideas of the philosopher, Gilles Deleuze, and his collaborator, the psychoanalyst, Félix Guattari. To illustrate the critical strategy, I analyze an argument which is in favor of GM agriculture by drawing on corpora of texts from websites which oppose this form of agriculture. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Critical argument analysis; Data aggregation; Deleuze and Guattari; Public sphere arguments; Rhizome; Web-based corpora",,,,,,,,,"Baker, P., (2006) Using Corpora in Discourse Analysis, , Continuum, London; (2009) Contemporary Corpus Linguistics, , Continuum, London, P.

More specifically, through a consideration of three Australian politically-focused blogs-Larvatus Prodeo (group-authored blog), Andrew Bolt (sole-authored blog by a conservative commentator), and Andrew Bartlett (sole-authored blog by a former Australian Democrats Senator)-we argue that such fora can indeed inform and enable the public sphere deliberation important for democracy. We found that although blog participants might not evidently come to rational and consensual agreements, they are debating issues of public concern, and can take part in exchanges that facilitate deliberation. In our conception, deliberation is not necessarily invalidated by either the lack of any tangible outcome, or the fact that any outcomes reached are only partial and contingent, open to revision. What is rather important is the practice and procedure of deliberation performed without stringent regulation by pre-set endpoints other than that of deliberation itself. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Barrett; Bolt; Larvatus Prodeo; Political blogging; Public deliberation",,,,,,,,,"http://andrewbartlett.com/?page_id=2035, About.

The fact that someone might also choose to simultaneously share the same life event on a blog (as the poster in this paper does) suggests there is a discursive goal that the blog accomplishes that Facebook cannot; on an event-specific blog, unlike on Facebook, the posts are arranged both chronologically and consecutively, within the frame of the overall event. For this reason, the blog is able to tell a narrative, while Facebook can only suggest one. At the same time, Facebook has its own interactive successes over a blog: it is ideal for audience collection, particularly for linking a narrative with people familiar with the protagonist. This particular type of audience is then able to help create the tellability of the narrative (it is of interest because it is a life event being experienced by someone they care about) and assist in shaping the small stories and connecting them discursively with the larger narrative that exists partially on the blog, and partially yet to be experienced. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Computer-mediated communication; Intertextuality; Mulitmodality; Small stories; Sociolinguistics",,,,,,,,,"Androutsopoulos, J., Potentials and limitations of discourse-centered online ethnography (2008), 5 (8). , Language@Internet(urn:nbn:de:0009-7-16100); Androutsopoulos, J., Introduction: sociolinguistics and computer-mediated communication (2006) Journal of Sociolinguistics, 10 (4), pp. 419-438; Bakhtin, M.M., (1984) Problems of Dostoevsky's Poetics, , University of Minnesota Press, Minneapolis; Bamberg, M., Stories: big or small-Why do we care?

In the Christian metal (CM) genre, however, the verbal dimension has a significant status. Drawing on the concept of entextualization, the process of producing texts through extraction and relocation, this paper describes how CM groups craft their discourse (song lyrics plus textual contents on their websites) by drawing on pre-existing biblical texts while connecting them with the resources provided by the metal music culture. Entextualization is a fruitful way of looking into how the Bible is used on CM band websites for mediating between Christianity and metal music culture. The analysis shows how the Bible is used in different ways for the purposes of identification and acknowledging spiritual inspiration and of making the Bible relevant for today's audiences. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Christian metal; Entextualization; Song lyrics; Subculture; The bible",,,,,,,,,"Androutsopoulos, Jannis, (2000), What names reveal about the music style: a study of naming patterns in popular music.

Vaya Semanita! (""What a week!""), a sketch-comedy program produced in Spain, illustrates the positions taken by different speakers toward the process of ""Basquization"" or Euskaldunization. More concretely, I focus on the figures of the ""euskaldunberri"" (the new-Basque speaker) who has learned Basque through instruction as opposed to the ""euskaldunzaharra"" (the old Basque speaker), whose native tongue is Basque. I argue that by way of social and political satire, the program represents stances and postures that do not tend to enter the public discourse on revitalization in the Basque Country. It is also through humor that Vaya Semanita helps viewers reflect on the social fields contributing to ethnolinguistic processes by cultivating a space where divergent identity orientations may be proposed, interpreted, contested, and consumed. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Basque country; Language learners; Language revitalization; Satire",,,,,,,,,"Alberdi, J., The development of the Basque system of terms of address and the allocutive conjugation (1995) Towards a History of the Basque Language, pp. 292-295. , John Benjamins Publishing Company, Amsterdam/Philadephia, J.I.

It has created new hopes as to how mobile phones would be able to close the so-called global digital gap that exists between the developed and the developing world and transform the fortunes of the poor. As ICTs are always embedded in social and economic realities and practices which deeply influence, define, and restrict people's mobile phone use, one should however be cautious in transporting and applying findings and studies focusing on the created opportunities of mobile phone use from one continent, country or even community to another.This article focuses on the mobile phone use of middle-aged women living in Wesbank, a post-apartheid township in Cape Town. By highlighting the main characteristics of the community (poverty, unemployment, crime, migration, multilingualism and illiteracy) I discuss the influences of these characteristics on mobile phone use. In this way, this article looks at the sociolinguistic aspects of discourse. By scrutinizing the availability and accessibility of certain resources and the unequal distribution of others, this ethnographic research looks at the conditions for discourse, or, in a lot of cases, conditions for 'non-discourse'. Although the adoption of a mobile phone creates diverse opportunities with regards to connectivity, safety, and literacy acquisition, poverty, crime and illiteracy are major constraints on the full realization of the potential. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Crime; ICTs; Illiteracy; Impoverishment; Mobile phone use; South Africa",,,,,,,,,"Achmat, F., Losch, A., Wesbank: power is the name of the game. power is the name of the problem (2002) Good Governance and Community Participation: Case Studies from the Western Cape, , Foundation for Contemporary Research, Cape Town, I.

The findings show parallels between the two datasets regarding the types of statement-questions prevalent, such as formulations of the interviewee's experiences (Heritage and Roth, 1995), appraisals of the interviewee-associated events, and third-party attributed/descriptive statements. Differences in the two datasets lie in the particular discursive formulations and subsequent functions of these similar types of statement-questions. For instance, the American English interviewers' third-party attributed/descriptive statements focus on public controversies, while the same types, in the Mandarin interviews, may evoke others' (hypothetical) perceptions of the guest as a person, effectuating a normative ideology. Overall, the study contributes to a broader understanding of the universality of indirect speech acts and the potential cultural specificity of indirect speech acts. The findings also expand the literature of media interviews by illustrating the types of statement-questions arguably particular to the celebrity interview genre, including use of positive addressee-assessments to organize topics and support the interviewee's public persona. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Broadcast interview; Celebrity interview; Indirect speech act; Mediated discourse; Questioning strategy; Talk show",,,,,,,,,"Aijmer, K., (2002) English Discourse Particles: Evidence from a Corpus, , John Benjamins, Amsterdam and Philadelphia; Bell, P., van Leeuwen, T., (1994) The Media Interview, , The University of New South Wales Press, Kensington; Blum-Kulka, S., The dynamics of political interviews (1983) Text, 3 (2), pp. 131-153; Bolinger, D.L.M., (1957) Interrogative Structures of American English: The Direct Question, , University of Alabama Press, Tuscaloosa; Brown, P., Levinson, S.C., (1987) Politeness: Some Universals in Language Usage, , Cambridge University Press, New York; Bruner, J., (1990) Acts of Meaning, , Harvard University Press, Cambridge, MA; Bruner, J., The narrative construction of reality (1991) Critical Inquiry, 18, pp. 1-21; Button, G., Casey, N., Topic nomination and topic pursuit (1985) Human Studies, 8 (1), pp. 3-55; Clayman, S.E., Displaying neutrality in television news interviews (1988) Social Problems, 35, pp. 474-492; Clayman, S.E., Heritage, J., (2002) News Interview: Journalists and Public Figures on the Air, , Cambridge University Press, Port Chester, NY; Corner, J., Mediated persona and political culture (2003) Media and the Restyling of Politics, , Sage, London, J.

The analysis draws upon Membership Categorisation Analysis, and in particular Sacks's (1995) discussion of categorial inferencing and category norms, to examine the way the host overlays individuals with membership categories and category-based actions. Moreover, this category work then provides for subsequent normative reasoning and moral judgements to be made for the overhearing audience. In summary the analysis demonstrates the way the show operates through making individuals and their actions morally accountable for the overhearing audience through routine categorisation work and related norms of behavior. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Categorial inferencing; Membership Categorisation Analysis; Norms in action; Talk shows",,,,,,,,,"Atkinson, J.M., Heritage, J., (1984) Structures of Social Action: Studies in Conversation Analysis, , Cambridge University Press, Cambridge; Bilmes, J., Taxonomies are for talking: a reanalysis of a Sacks classic (2009) Journal of Pragmatics, 41 (8), pp. 1600-1610; Bilmes, J., Occasioned semantics: a systematic approach to meaning in talk (2011) Human Studies, 34 (2), pp. 129-153; Butler, C.W., (2008) Talk and Social Interaction in the Playground, , Ashgate, Aldershot; Butler, C.W., Fitzgerald, R., Membership-in-action: operative identities in a family meal (2010) Journal of Pragmatics, 42 (9), pp. 2462-2474; Edwards, D., (1997) Discourse and Cognition, , Sage, London; Eglin, P., Hester, S., (2003) A Story of Membership Categorizisation Analysis, , The Montreal Massacre.

Comparisons across three age groups - children, teenagers, and adults - revealed significant differences in caller behaviour. Whereas teenagers and adults offered reports of the incident, child callers were more prone to request dispatch of specific assistance units. This pattern was only observable when children were accompanied by an adult relative, which leads us to propose that child callers may be operating under prior adult instruction concerning how to request help. The second part of the analysis examines the local organisation of participants' actions, showing how turn-design and sequencing manifest the local concerns of the two parties. The analysis thus combines quantitative and qualitative methods to explore the ways through which the parties jointly produce an early sense of emergency incidents. These results are discussed in terms of children's agency and competence as informants granted to them by emergency operators, and how such competence ascriptions run against commonsense conceptualisations of children as less-than-full-fledged members of society. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Children's interactions; Children's participation; Emergency calls; Ethnomethodology; Talk-in-interaction; Telephone calls",,,,,,"ForskningsrÃ¥det fÃ¶r Arbetsliv och Socialvetenskap, FAS: P2007-0837:1-E, 2005-0236","This work was made possible through research grants from the Swedish Council for Working Life and Social Research (grant #2005-0236) as well as the Bank of Sweden (RJ grant # P2007-0837:1-E).

It thereby addresses a gap in the cartoon literature, where claims about point of view, persuasive effects and style are often intuitive, rather than based on systematic analysis. The tools of verbal and visual appraisal analysis and the concept of evaluative key are explained. Some proposals are offered concerning the specific contribution of visual-verbal interaction to evaluation. Detailed appraisal analyses and discussion of three cartoons illustrate the different configurations of appraisal resources realising the evaluative key of each, and how evaluative meanings and viewer alignment depend on multiple interactions between visual and verbal appraisal and ideation. Three types of evaluative key are proposed: observer voice, jester voice and indicter voice. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Attitude; Cartoons; Evaluation; Evaluative key; Graduation; Visual appraisal",,,,,,,,,"Artz, L., Pollock, M., Limiting the options: Anti-Arab images in US media coverage of the Persian Gulf crisis (1995) The US Media and the Middle East: Image and Perception, pp. 119-135. , Greenwood Press, Westport CT, Yahya Kamalipour (Ed.); Baumgartner, J., Editorial cartoons 2.00: The effects of digital political satire on presidential candidate evaluations (2008) Presidential Studies Quarterly, pp. 735-758; Benoit, W.L., Klyukovski, A.A., McHale, J.P., Arine, D., A fantasy theme analysis of political cartoons on the Clinton-Lewinsky-Starr affair (2001) Critical Studies in Media Communication, 18, pp. 377-394; Liliana, B., Forceville, C., Metaphors in editorial cartoons representing the global financial crisis (2011) Visual Communication., pp. 209-229; Coupe, W.A., Observations on a theory of political caricature (1969) Comparative Studies in Society and History, pp. 79-95; DeSousa, M., Medhurst, M.J., The editorial cartoon as visual rhetoric: rethinking boss tweed (1982) Journal of Visual Verbal Languaging, pp. 52-61; DeSousa, M.A., Symbolic action and pretended insight: The Ayatollah Khomeini in US editorial cartoons (1984) Rhetorical Dimensions in Media.

Research (Martin and White, 2005; Bednarek, 2008 and Pounds, 2010) has shown that authorial affect is virtually absent in quality British print-media news reporting. In the case of television news reporting, however, the nature and distribution of authorial affect have not yet been investigated in any detail. This paper shows how the appraisal framework (Martin and White, 2005) and Montgomery's classification of authorial voices in television news reporting (2007) may be used as a basis for such an investigation. The analysis is applied to an episode of the British news programme BBC News at Ten. The findings show that, as might be expected, some authorial affect is, to some extent, always conveyed through the audio-visual and dialogic dimensions. It is further shown, however, how affective expression still appears to be subject to some constraints in relation to the nature of the authorial voices represented in the programme, even though the distinction is often blurred. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Affect; Authorial voice; Emotion; News values; TV news reporting",,,,,,,,,"Allern, S., Journalistic and commercial news values: news organizations as patrons of an institution and market actors (2002) Norcom Review, 23 (1-2), pp. 137-152; Baldry, A., Thibault, P.J., Multimodal Transcription and Text Analysis (2005) London, , Equinox; http://www.bbc.co.uk/guidelines/editorialguidelines/page/guidelines-impartiality-principles/, BBC Website; Bednarek, M., (2008) Emotion Talk across Corpora, , Palgrave Macmillan, Basingstoke and New York; Bednarek, M., (2010) The Language of Fictional Television: Drama and Identity, pp. 143-179. , Continuum, London, New York, (Chapter 7); Clore, G.L., Schnall, S., The influence of affect on attitude (2005) Handbook of Attitudes, pp. 437-489. , Erlbaum, Mahwah, D.

It is interested in the communicative mechanisms by which such texts are often able to advance or favour particular value positions while employing a relatively impersonal style in which attitudinal evaluations and other potentially contentious meanings are largely confined to material attributed to quoted sources. It reviews previous research on the evaluative qualities of these texts, with special reference to the literature on attribution and so-called 'evidentiality' in news discourse. It is proposed that understandings of the axiological workings of these text can be enhanced by referencing some of the key insights emerging from what is termed the 'Appraisal 'framework', an approach to the analysis of evaluative language developed within the Systemic Functional Linguistic paradigm of Michael Halliday and his associates. In particular it is proposed that understandings of the workings of these texts can be enhanced by referencing proposals in the Appraisal literature with respect to implicit or 'invoked' attitude and by reference to an account of attribution and so-called 'evidentiality' which is grounded in Bakhtinian notions of dialogism, rather than in notions of truth functionality and certainty-of-knowledge claims. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Appraisal; Attribution; Dialogism; Evidentiality; Journalism; News",,,,,,,,,"Bakhtin, M., (1981) The dialogical imagination (C.

From this perspective, news values are not beliefs that journalist hold or criteria that they apply, they are values that are constructed by choices in language and image. We argue that attention needs to be paid to the contribution of both modalities to this construction to gain a fuller understanding of how events are retold and made 'newsworthy'. We illustrate our 'discursive' approach to news values through close analysis of online reporting of the 2011 Queensland floods on smh.com.au (the website of The Sydney Morning Herald, an Australian metropolitan broadsheet newspaper). As will be seen, a discursive perspective on news values provides a framework that allows for systematic analysis of how such values are constructed in both words and images. It allows researchers to systematically examine how particular events are construed as newsworthy, what values are emphasised in news stories, and how language and image establish events as more or less newsworthy. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Appraisal/evaluation/stance; Disaster reporting; Image analysis; News values",,,,,,,,,"Allan, S., (2010) News Culture, , McGraw Hill and Open University Press, Maidenhead/New York; Bednarek, M., (2006) Evaluation in Media Discourse, , Continuum, London/New York; Bednarek, M., (2008) Emotion Talk Across Corpora, , Palgrave Macmillan, Houndmills, New York; Bednarek, M., Caple, H., Playing with environmental stories in the news: good or bad practice?

While previous studies have explored quite extensively how journalists manage to achieve a ""neutralistic"" posture within news interviews and other forms of political broadcast talk, they have been cautious about incorporating reflections on the role of programme formats. This study raises questions about how televisual formats (can) play a role in the formulation of a professional, distancing journalistic self in political television programmes. The analysis draws on transcriptions of 19 pre-election debates broadcast on Flemish public service television (VRT) in 2009. Inspired by a conversation analytic framework and building on Clayman's (1988, 1992, 2002, 2007) findings on the use of footing shifts in news interviews, the analysis shows that the presence of pre-produced, format-related components, such as public surveys, reportages and expert commentaries, enlarges the journalist-presenters' ""pool"" of strategic resources to reach, defend and legitimise a neutralistic stance. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Interaction; Journalism; Neutralism; Political television talk; Programme formats; Self-presentation",,,,,,,,,"Altheide, D.L., The media self (1984) The Existential Self in Society, pp. 177-195. , The University of Chicago Press, Chicago, J.A.

In this paper, we aim to contribute to this issue by empirically testing this informalization thesis for Dutch. For this purpose we operationalize informalization in terms of linguistic expressions of subjectivity. Subjectivity is considered here as the expression of speakers of themselves and their own 'private states', such as attitudes, beliefs, opinions, emotions and evaluations. Our model of subjectivity includes elements such as personal pronouns (first and second person), modal verbs and modal adverbials.Comparing newspapers from 1950/1 and 2002, we are able to show that, based on those parameters, subjectivity in Dutch newspapers has increased. However, it is not primarily journalists who express themselves and their private states more: rather, the increasing subjectivity lies in the citations of words of other speakers embedded in the newspaper articles. The use of direct quotations has almost doubled, and the subjectivity expressed in the quotations has increased dramatically as well.It seems, then, that in this case the subjectivity assumed in the informalization thesis lies primarily in the proportion of quoted speech of characters in the news texts and in the subjective content of that speech. Informalization does not occur primarily through a more oral style in the journalist's text, but through literal citations of conversations of other speakers. © 2012.","Conversation; Informalization; News; Oral style; Stance; Subjectivity",,,,,,,"For the annotation of part of speech and lemma information we made use of Tadpole, a program for automatic morpho-syntactic analysis and parsing of Dutch texts ( van den Bosch et al., 2007 ).

Its main plea is that appraisal resources, metaphors or agency expressions in a newspaper article are not the only traces of a journalist's line of vision: a journalist's assessment as to whether particular information is worth mentioning in the article and whether or not the information will be covered in substantial detail are also - be it less explicit and hence more difficult to pin down - expressions of evaluation.News production is in essence a delicate game of choice-making at various levels, not only between including overt or implicit evaluative expressions in the text, but also between providing more or less relevant information, and between giving a detailed or vague description of that information: choices which are at all times governed and constrained by the specific socio-economic and professional context in which the journalist operates. For that reason this paper argues that future research on journalistic stance should try to expand the notion of evaluation to all discursive levels at which choice-making is at stake.In order to support our claim, the paper presents a case study cross-comparing 48 news articles reporting on one and the same news event: the resignation of the Belgian federal government in April 2010. The articles were written by 16 different foreign correspondents attached to broadsheet newspapers from four neighbouring countries of Belgium. The majority of the news articles are characterized by a low frequency of explicit evaluative language (reporter voice). Relying on systematic cross-comparison of appraisal resources and triangulation with ethnographic data, the paper uncovers manifestations of journalistic stance across multiple levels of discourse in order to demonstrate how the intricate puzzle of choice-making affects coverage of the news event. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Appraisal theory; Journalistic stance; Linguistic ethnography; Media discourse",,,,,,,,,"Bednarek, M.A., (2006) Evaluation in Media Discourse: Analysis of a Newspaper Corpus, , Continuum, London/New York; Bednarek, M.A., Dimensions of evaluation: cognitive and linguistic perspectives (2009) Pragmatics & Cognition, 17 (1), pp. 146-175; Blommaert, J., Context is/as critique (2001) Critique of Anthropology, 21 (1), pp. 13-32; Blommaert, J., (2005) Discourse: A Critical Introduction, , Cambridge University Press, Cambridge; Bell, A., (1991) The Language of News Media, , Blackwell Publishing, Oxford; Caple, H., Intermodal relations in image nuclear news stories (2008) Multimodal Semiotics: Functional Analysis in Contexts of Education, pp. 125-138. , Continuum, London, L.

In particular, the concept of 'neutralism', central to the analysis of interviewer (IR) strategies in the UK and USA, has been found to be both internationally variable and not necessarily adhered to in some contemporary political interviews. On occasion IRs have been found to use strategies of 'assertion' in which they state their own opinions and argue with interviewees, and it is further suggested that these practices are becoming increasingly prevalent. To investigate these questions, this article presents a survey of IR strategies in a particular sub-species of news interview, the 'set-piece' election interviews with party leaders that have been a feature of British broadcasting since 1983. In this context it is found that adversarial interviewing has always involved some use of IR assertion and that this practice did indeed increase in the late 1990s, but it is also suggested that IRs might have felt justified in these departures from 'neutralism' by changing definitions of their role as 'tribune of the people'. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Adversarial questioning; British general elections; Interviewer assertions; Neutralism; News interview",,,,,,,,,"Bar-Hillel, M., Mendick, R., (2010), http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/politics/david-cameron/7628744, Paxman on Cameron: ""He's a bit of a smooth b ******isn't he?; Brown, P., Levinson, S., (1987) Politeness: some universals in language usage, , Cambridge University Press, Cambridge; Bull, P., On identifying questions replies and non-replies in political interviews (1994) Journal of Language and Social Psychology, 13, pp. 115-131; Bull, P., Meyer, K., Interruptions in political interviews: a study of Margaret Thatcher and Neil Kinnock (1988) Journal of Language and Social Psychology, 7, pp. 35-45; Bull, P., Elliott, J., Level of threat: a means of assessing interviewer toughness and neutrality (1998) Journal of Language and Social Psychology, 17, pp. 220-244; Bull, P., Fetzer, A., Face, facework and political discourse (2010) International Review of Social Psychology, 23, pp. 155-185; Clayman, S., Footing in the achievement of neutrality: the case of news interviews (1992) Talk at Work: Interaction in Institutional Settings, , Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, P.

The balance of duties and rights is tipped as incarcerated persons bear a diminished amount of control over their interaction with others, especially those on the outside. Based on the blogs of five prisoners, we ask how the internet is used to change the rules of engagement with the outside world, especially in terms of redefining the moral space of rights and duties within which persons position themselves and others. A third party, who we call ""positioning mediators"", succors the prisoners to re-negotiate their positioning in this mediated interaction. We examine the mediators' meta-positioning and the prisoners' re-negotiation of self-positioning in the cyberspace and cybertime within the interactive discourse of prisoners' blogging. Our conclusion shows how this blogging ultimately allows for the resumption of authors' agency and subjectivity. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Internet; Narrative; Positioning theory; Prison writing; Prisoner blogging",,,,,,,,,"Abu-jamal, M., (1995) Live from Death Row, , Addison-Wesley, Reading, MA; Abu-jamal, M., (2009) Jailhouse Lawyers: Prisoners Defending Prisoners v. the U.S.A, , City Lights Publishers, San Francisco, CA; Policy 914, pp. 1-10. , http://www.azcorrections.gov/Hema_PO_DO914.aspx, Arizona Department of Corrections, 2010a (26 February).

Drawing on Bolter and Grusin's (1999) notion of 'remediation' we examine how the news studio and presentation style has begun to borrow artefacts and language styles that resemble the domestic sphere in layout and discourse. We begin by noting the increasing use of domestic furniture from which news is presented before then examining how the presenters in a particular news program present a newspaper review section during the program. What is notable here is the way the presenters do not stick to the topical news stories of the day but use the stories to touch off further personal stories about themselves, and which take up most of the allocated time slot. In the final section we examine how this level of informality is utilised in integrating viewer comments and feedback into the going interaction maintaining a level of synchronicity of topical comment. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Broadcast news; Discourse; Furniture; Remediation",,,,,,,,,"Allan, S., (2006), Online News, McGraw International, Maidenhead; Baumgartner, J., Morris, J.S., The Daily Show effect: candidate evaluations, efficacy, and the American youth (2006) American Politics Research, 34, pp. 341-367; Bolter, J., Grusin, R., (1999) Remediation: Understanding New Media, , MIT Press, Cambridge, MA; Bourdieu, P., (1984) Distinction: a social critique of the Judgement of Taste, , Harvard University Press, Cambridge, MA; Coleman, S., Election Call 2001: how politicians and the public interacted (2002) Parliamentary Affairs, 55, pp. 731-742; Conboy, M., (2006) Tabloid Britain: constructing a community through language, , Routledge, Abingdon, Oxon; Coupland, N., Stylization, authenticity and TV news review (2001) Discourse Studies, 3, pp. 413-442; Downes, E.J., McMillan, S.J., Defining interactivity (2000) New Media & Society, pp. 157-179; (1992) Talk at Work, , Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK, P.

A corpus of six constructed weeks of front pages and home pages published from September 2010 to February 2011 is analyzed in terms of news selection, framing and construction by different actors. The analysis shows that the most prominent headlines on the front pages and home pages share a similar focus whose strong tendencies are emphasized in the top headlines. However, the home page may appear less 'elitist' by the way its headlines reflect the rapid turnover of online news, by being less 'highbrow' in what it covers, and by including more and different voices thanks particularly to the pictures accompanying the top stories. These differences might indicate an evolution in the concept of journalism and its links to citizenship. It is suggested that keeping neighboring but separate desks for the print and online editions is worth trying for the survival of Western print quality media. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.",,,,,,,"University of Alberta, U of A","I would like to thank my research assistant, Iaroslav Pankovskyi, for his assistance in data gathering and picture coding, and the two anonymous reviewers for their detailed and very helpful comments.
